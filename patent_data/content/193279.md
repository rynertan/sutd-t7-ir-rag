## Description
This invention relates to a container for use in blood test. More particularly, it relates to a vacuum blood collection tube in which a whole sample of blood is collected from the person to be tested, and which is centrifugated to obtain the serum from the sample. The rapid advances in techniques for clinical laboratory tests, along with the wider use of blood test, including serum biochemistry tests, serum immunological tests, corpuscle tests, and so on, are contributing to the prevention of disease and also to diagnosis at early stages. The majority of blood tests are serum tests, and usually the serum that is required for such tests is collected as blood in a container for use in blood tests, and allowed to coagulate the serum is then collected by centrifugation, by which the blood clot a mass made of a gel mixture of fibrin and blood corpuscles is separated. Syringes are used to collect blood from the person to be tested, but recently, a blood sampling method in which vacuum blood collection tubes are used is also available. When vacuum blood collection tubes are used to collect blood, the blood is collected into the vacuum blood collection tube by the introduction of vacuum conditions through a special blood collection tube holder. The fabricative materials used for vacuum blood collection tubes are either synthetic resins such as polymethylmethacrylate or glass. However, in vacuum blood collection tubes made of these fabricative materials, when the blood is collected, quite a long time is required for the blood to coagulate so that the serum and the blood clot can be separated, and the serum that is required for the test can not necessarily be available rapidly. This becomes a particular problem when the test is an emergency one. Even in vacuum blood collection tubes made of glass, in which blood coagulation time is shorter, from When extremely fine grains of an inorganic substance such as glass, etc., are attached to the walls of the tube, the coagulation time of the blood is shortened. When a separating agent incorporating silicon oil, powdered silicon compounds, etc., is present in the blood collection tube, this causes an increase in the separability of the serum. Such separating agents use the property of thixotropy, and are prepared so as to have a specific gravity of the intermediate between that of the serum and the blood clot. For that reason, after the blood that has been collected is allowed to coagulate, and when the blood collection tube is placed in a centrifugal field, the separating agent moves to the interface between the serum layer and the clotted blood layer, separating them. If it will take time until the various kinds of tests will take place on the sample serum prepared by the above mentioned process, the blood collection tube is stored as it is at a temperature of less than If vacuum blood collection tubes are stored having internal low pressure before blood is collected, then, because the collection tube has some permeability to gas, the low pressure conditions inside the tube are rapidly lost, due to atmosphere oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor. To solve the above mentioned problems, vacuum blood collection tubes are ordinarily vacuum wrapped in a separate wrapping material. The wrapping material used for the vacuum wrapping is, for example, a metal can, or a laminated film of aluminum foil, etc. Metal cans are rigid, so they are excellent in the protection of vacuum blood collection tubes. In addition, they act as excellent gas barriers. Their defects are that they are heavy and bulky. They are also expensive. Laminated films of aluminum foil are flexible, and have the advantages of not being hard or bulky. However, in making the vacuum blood collection tube air tight, there is the possibility of injuring them by crushing. The resistance and the strength against being ripped of aluminum foil are inferior, and pinholes readily form when, for instance, a section of the foil is crumpled. Once a gas such as oxygen has been allowed into the inside of the wrapping material of aluminum foil, the low pressure conditions inside the vacuum blood collection tube are lost. Accordingly, the ability of aluminum foil to act as a gas barrier is imperfect.

According to the present invention, there is provided a vacuum blood collection tube comprising a tube shaped vessel having an opening through which air can be removed, and a plug that makes the opening air tight to maintain low pressure conditions inside the said vessel, said vessel being fabricated from polyethyleneterephthalate, a copolymer of polyethyleneterephthalate, or an acrylonitrile resin, and the inner walls of said vessel incorporating The adsorptive inorganic substance has, in a preferred embodiment, an absorption amount of linseed oil of 20 40 ml 100 g and a BET specific surface area of 5,000 30,000 cm² g. A thixotropic partitioning agent is, in a preferred embodiment, used within said vessel. The partitioning agent contains, in a preferred embodiment, both agents that confer the property of thixotropy and viscous liquid. Alternatively, the partitioning agent contains, in a preferred embodiment, thixotropy conferring agents, viscous liquids and water insoluble amines. The tube shaped vessel is, in a preferred embodiment, wrapped so as to be air tight in a plastic wrapping that acts as a gas barrier, the space between said tube shaped vessel and said wrapping being filled with a gas that does not readily permeate either the vessel material or the wrapping material, and the pressure of said gas being greater than atmospheric pressure. The amount of said gas that permeates both the tube shaped vessel and the wrapping is, in a preferred embodiment, 2cm³ m² 24h 98100 Pa or less at Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing a vacuum blood collection tube in which a whole blood sample that has been collected can coagulate in a short period of time, and which is placed in a centrifugal field resulting in an effective separation of the serum and the blood clot 2 providing a vacuum blood collection tube in which after centrifugation, the tube can be stored as it is for a long time at low temperatures without decrease in the quality of the serum that is, providing a vacuum blood collection tube that also acts as a storage vessel for blood serum 3 providing a vacuum blood collection tube in which the space between the tube shaped vessel and the wrapping material is filled with a gas of low permeability at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, so that the low pressure conditions inside the tube shaped vessel can be maintained with certainty for long periods of time 4 providing a vacuum blood collection tube wrapped in a wrapping made of a material that is markedly better than the material used conventionally for wrapping vacuum blood collection tubes in its ability to act as a gas barrier and 5 providing a vacuum blood collection tube wrapped without damage in a wrapping material that has excellent flexibility, is light, is not bulky, and is low in cost. The fabricative materials of a tubular vessel forming a vacuum blood collection tube of the present invention are, for example, polyethylene terephthalate of the structural formula shown below Polyethyleneterephthalate is highly crystalline, so that to control this property, a copolymer of polyethyleneterephthalate copolymerized with an agent to control crystallization such as 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol at the proportion of Also, acrylonitrile resins may be used as materials for the tube shaped vessel of the vacuum blood collection tubes of this invention. For the acrylonitrile resins that may be used in the present invention, a resin, the main ingredient of which is polymerized acrylonitrile, is indicated, and generally, a copolymer of acrylonitrile and a small amount of butadiene as the rubber ingredient, and or one kind or two or more kinds of acrylates and or methacrylates such as methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate are used. Such acrylonitrile resins have excellent abilities to act as a gas barrier, so that when they are used in the vacuum blood collection tubes of the present invention, it is possible to maintain a fixed level of reduced pressure. Also, their resistance to shock is much better than that of glass or polymethylmethacrylate, and there is no danger of damage arising from the process of bringing about low pressure. For disposal after use, it is possible to destroy the tubes by fire, which cannot be done with vacuum blood collection tubes made of glass. For the air tight plug of the opening of vacuum blood collection tubes in which low pressure conditions are to be maintained, it is desirable to use articles constructed from materials known to those skilled in the art such as isobutylene isoprene rubber or chlorinated isobutylene isoprene rubber. To keep the inside of the blood collection tube at low pressure, the above mentioned rubber stopper should be applied to the said tube within a container at a low pressure. For the hydrophilic substance that is difficult or impossible to dissolve in water and that is capable of preventing blood clots from adhering to the inner walls of the tube, examples thereof are modified aliphatic silicone oils, modified aromatic silicone oils, modified paraffin, modified wax, etc. Examples of the modified aliphatic silicone oils are dimethylpolysiloxane, methylhydrogenpolysiloxane into which polar groups have been introduced. Examples of the polar groups are hydroxyl groups, amino groups, carboxyl groups, epoxy groups, polyether groups. An example of the modified aromatic silicone oils is methylphenylpolysiloxane into which the above mentioned polar groups have been introduced. The modified paraffin and the modified wax are paraffin and wax into which the above mentioned polar groups have been introduced. Partially esterified polyhydric alcohols, partially esterified polyglycols can be used. The most preferable example thereof is silicone oil into which polar groups have been introduced. The above mentioned hydrophilic substances are not surface active agents, but when they are present on the inside wall of the vessel, they prevent the blood clot from sticking to the surface of the inner wall, and if the blood clot should become attached, they act to peel the clot from the surface. As the contact enhancing substance, it is possible to use either water soluble compounds of low molecular weight, or those of high molecular weight. The water soluble compounds of low molecular weight are ethyleneglycol, glycerin, sorbitol. Those of high molecular weight are polyethyleneoxide, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium polyacrylate, polyethyleneimine, sodium alginate, starch, pullulan, methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, gum arabic, tragacanth gum, locust bean gum, guar gum, pectin, carrageenan, furcellaran, glue, gelatin, casein. The most preferable examples are polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyethylene oxide. These contact enhancing substances prevent the above mentioned hydrophilic substance from covering the surfaces of the inorganic adsorptive substances, thereby preventing a decrease in the acceleration of blood coagulation caused by these adsorptive inorganic substances. These contact enhancing substances act to improve the contact between the adsorptive inorganic substances and the blood. The adsorptive inorganic substances are water insoluble inorganic fine grain substances that are used as adaptive agents glass, silica, kaolin, cerite and bentonite. The diameters of the particles of the adsorptive inorganic substance should be Such adsorptive inorganic substances accelerate the activity of blood coagulation factors when touching the blood, and moreover act to stimulate the agglomeration of platelets. However, in order that the adsorptive inorganic substance effectively causes the acceleration of blood coagulation, it is desirable to keep the absorption amount of linseed oil, BET specific surface area, and the specific resistance within fixed limits. The absorption amount of linseed oil and the BET specific surface area express the extent of the surface area of the adsorptive inorganic substance, and the surface area is correlated with the extent of spaces between the pores on the surface of the adsorptive inorganic substance. Thus, depending on the absorption amount of oil and the BET specific surface area, it is possible to know the extent of spaces between the pores on the surface thereof. As the desirable adsorptive inorganic substance for this invention, the absorption amount of linseed oil should be The absorption amount of linseed oil follows that established in JIS K 5101. The BET specific surface area is a value which is calculated as follows The amount of gas to cover the surface completely as a layer of single molecules is, first, obtained from the amount of gas adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorptive inorganic substance, the equilibrium pressure at that time, and the vapor saturation pressure of the adsorbing gas. The result is then multiplied by the mean sectional area of the adsorptive gas molecules, resulting in a value for the BET specific surface area. The adsorptive gas may be nitrogen gas, oxygen gas, argon gas, methane gas. Thus, by this method, it is possible to calculate the surface area including the pores, which cannot be directly calculated by the measurement of the adsorption amount of linseed oil. At the time of blood coagulation, activation of the XII factor i.e., the contact factor is attained. For that, it is necessary that three substances, prekallikrein, a kininogen of high molecular weight, and the XII factor form a complex on the surface of a foreign substance and that the complex is adsorbed therein. If one or two of these substances are lacking, the activation of the XII factor will not take place. When adsorptive inorganic substances are used in the expectation that they will act to accelerate the coagulation of the blood, if the surface area is extremely large, a complex is not formed on the surface of the absorptive inorganic substance, and the proportion adsorbed of the XII factor, the prekallikrein, and the kininogen of high molecular weight is increased. In other word, the percentage of complex formation of the three substances required for the activation of the XII factor decreases. Accordingly, this means that, on the contrary, the effect of accelerating the blood coagulation decreases. In reverse, if the surface area of the adsorptive inorganic substance is too small, the probability of adsorption of the coagulation factor becomes less, and an effect of acceleration of blood coagulation cannot be expected. For that reason, the preferred limits of the conditions for the adsorptive inorganic substance for this invention are an absorption amount of linseed oil of The specific resistance of the adsorptive inorganic substance of the present invention is preferably 1x10¹⁰Ω cm or less, more preferably 5x10⁴Ω cm or less. At ordinary temperatures, the specific resistance is the reciprocal of electrical conductivity. With an adsorptive inorganic substance, the specific resistance maintains the adjustability of the distribution of electrical potential between the protein and the adsorptive inorganic substance, and contributes to preventing changes in the conformation of the protein. Adsorptive inorganic substances act to accelerate the coagulation of blood, but on the other hand, such adsorptive inorganic substances make adhesion to the wall surface of the vessel by the blood clot more likely, so that even when the coagulated blood is put into a centrifuge, the separation of serum and blood clot into phases may be difficult. However, the above mentioned hydrophilic substances and water soluble substances, when present, reduce the tendency of the blood clot to adhere, which is caused by the adsorptive inorganic substance, without damaging the effect of acceleration of blood coagulation. That various substances mentioned above are in the inner wall of the vessel means that nowhere else but the wall, either the inner wall of the vessel or the inner part of the wall contain these substances. For example, each of the above mentioned substances, the hydrophilic substance, the contact enhancing substance, and the adsorptive inorganic substance, are either dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent and or a suitable binder, and the resultant mixture is sprayed onto the surface of the inner wall of the vessel, or the inner surface is soaked in this mixture. Alternatively, the above mentioned hydrophilic substance is mixed into the polyethyleneterephtalate pellet or acrylonitrile resins and a vessel is made of the mixture then a mixture of the contact enhancing substance and the adsorptive inorganic substance in a suitable solvent and or a suitable binder is applied to the inner wall of the vessel by a spray or soaking treatment. The amount of the above mentioned hydrophilic substance and contact enhancing substance that should be present on the inner wall of the vessel is preferably 1x10 ¹⁰ g cm² or more. The amount of the adsorptive inorganic substance that should be present is preferably 1x10 ⁶ g cm² or more. If there is an excessive amount, this will interfere with the results of the blood tests. Therefore, there should be no more than 1x10 ² g cm² of all of these substances taken together. Thus, according to the present invention, blood coagulation factors are rapidly activated, and the time required for the blood to coagulate is much shortened. Moreover, fibrin, which causes blood coagulation, and the resultant blood clot do not adhere to the inner wall of the vessel, so that separation of serum and the blood clot is satisfactory, and there is no problem arising from there being fibrin or parts of the blood clot mixed into the serum that is obtained after separation. Moreover, since the components of the blood clot are contracted enough, a larger yield of serum is obtained. Generally, biochemistry tests in which only serum can be used are numerous. After centrifugation, the serum that is obtained is sucked up into a pipette from the vessel for use in blood tests. However, this step of sampling takes time. Transporting the vessel as it is not advisable. For that reason it is normal to supply an agent that forms a partition inside the vessel. As the agent has a composition that has thixotropy and that forms a partition at the position between the serum and blood clot after centrifugation, it is possible to decant the serum. Substances that are thixotropic preferably include inorganic fine powder such as silica, alumina, glass, talc, kaolin, benthonite, titania, zirconium, asbestos, carbon black, etc., organic fine powder such as styrene polymers and copolymers, acrylic resins and polyvinyl chloride resins, etc. Of these agents that confer the property of thixotropy, a fine silica powder gives the best results. This fine silica powder contains a fine powder in which the main component is anhydrous silicic acid. The fine powder is, as desired, treated for hydrophobicity by a graft reaction or a coupling reaction. It is possible to use the starting material in the natural state as a powder or as a mass. It is desirable for the mean diameter of these agents that confer the property of thixotropy to be For the viscous liquid, it is acceptable to use either one that has strong mutual effects with the agent that confers thixotropy, or one that does not have strong mutual effects. Also, it is advisable to use substances that are compatible with each other. To have strong mutual effects with the agent that confers thixotropy means that after uniform dispersal of the mixture of a certain agent that confers the property of thixotropy with a certain viscous liquid, and even after 30 minutes of centrifugation at The reason for such mutual effects is not known, but possibly hydrogen bondings that arise between materials having hydrophilic groups are the main cause, and perhaps aggregation arising between materials without hydrophilic groups because of their molecular structures is a cause. As viscous liquids that have a strong mutual effect with agents that confer the property of thixotropy, the animal and plant oils, and the said oils and liquid polymers into which acid radical e.g., maleic acid have been introduced can be used. The animal and plant oils are, for example, soybean oil, linseed oil, safflower oil, fish oils. The liquid polymers are, for example, acryl resin oligomers, polyester oligomers, liquid polyisoprene, liquid polybutene, liquid polybutadiene, etc. Also, the animal and plant oils and liquid polymers into which epoxy groups have been introduced can be used. When the agents that confer the property of thixotropy are organic powders, as the viscous liquid the same kind of oligomer as the thixotropy conferring agents can be used. For instance, when the agent is styrene, styrene oligomer can be used as the viscous liquid. Whichever is used, a viscosity of Even viscous liquids that do not have a strong mutual effect with agents that confer the property of thixotropy can be used in the presence of water insoluble amine compounds in connection with the present invention. As such a viscous liquid, other liquid substances of high molecular weight such as liquid paraffin, liquid polyisoprene, liquid polybutene, liquid polybutadiene and styrene oligomers and their chlorinated compounds can all be used. When the thixotropic agent is a resin of the styrene type, liquid paraffin and its chlorinated compounds can be used, the viscosity of which is preferably It is also possible to use a mixture of a viscous liquid that has a strong mutual effect with a thixotropic agent and another viscous liquid that does not have a strong mutual effect with the thixotropic agent but is readily compatible with that viscous liquid. In this case, the phrase readily compatible is used to describe the situation in which after the two viscous liquids are mixed until dispersion is uniform, and after this mixture is left for one week at ordinary temperatures, there is no phase separation. When the mixture of a viscous liquid that has a strong mutual effect with a thixotropic agent and another viscous liquid that does not have a strong mutual effect with the thixotropic agent but is readily compatible with that viscous liquid is used, its viscosity is stable for a long period. In such a case, suitable limits should be established for the relative proportions of the two viscous liquids in the mixture with careful consideration given to the strength of the mutual action with the thixotropic agent. Ordinarily, with a viscous liquid having a strong mutual effect with a thixotropic agent, for Such stability of the viscosity of the mixture becomes yet greater when water insoluble amine compounds are used. For the water insoluble amine compounds, compounds with one or more alkyl groups containing eight or more carbon atoms are desirable, examples of which are dodecylamine, tetradecylamine, hexadecylamine, octadecylamine, dodecyldimethylamine, tetradecyldimethylamine, octadecyldimethylamine, polyoxyethyleneoctadecylamine, trioctylamine. The reason why the above mentioned amine compounds are used is that they have the property of being readily adsorbed onto the surface of the thixotropic agent and that they have mutual effects with both the thixotropy conferring agent and the viscous liquid so that the stability of the degree of viscosity can be increased even as time lapses. The reason for amines with alkyl groups having eight or more carbon atoms being desirable is not only that these amines are superior in having a high degree of insolubility in water and in the property of not dissolving into the separated serum or blood clot, but also that long chain alkyl groups of the amine compounds that are adsorbed onto the surface of a thixotropic agent act together to increase the stability. By the use of the above mentioned amine compounds, the stability of the degree of viscosity of the partitioning agent is markedly improved, and as a result, separation is done using a centrifuge, and the partition is very stable. Concerning the proportions of the thixotropy conferring agent and the viscous liquid that should be used, for The specific gravity of the partitioning agent is ordinarily When such a partitioning agent is used, the serum and the blood clot are separated by centrifugation, and a partition is formed at the interface between the serum and the blood clot. Once the partition is formed, it is stably maintained and will not be destroyed even though the vessel is tilted to one side, so that the serum can readily be obtained by a simple procedure such as decantation. To obtain the vacuum blood collection tube of the present invention, it is necessary first to form a tube shaped vessel by the appropriate molding procedures of injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, transfer molding, vacuum molding, casting molding using polyethyleneterephthalate, polyethyleneterephthalate copolymers, or acrylonitrile resins. At that time, as mentioned above, it is acceptable to mix a hydrophilic substance therein. Alternatively, on the inner surface of the wall of the vessel made in this molding technique, the above mentioned method is used to incorporate a hydrophilic substance, a contact enhancing substance, and an adsorptive inorganic substance. This tube should then be sealed with a seal that makes the vessel air tight. In addition, the partitioning agent may be placed, in advance, in the tube, or it may be added after the sampled blood is allowed to coagulate, during the step of centrifugation. The vacuum tube with the inner section of which made in this way and brought to have low pressure is used to collect blood from the person to be tested, and the blood is left at ordinary temperatures for about The fabricative material of the vessel of the vacuum blood collection tube of this invention is either polyethleneterephthalate, a copolymer of polyethyleneterephthalate, or acrylonitrile resin, which has low hydrophilicity, and thus unlike with conventional hydrophilic materials, such as, for example, glass or polymethylmethacrylate, there is no layer of water molecules adsorbed on the inner surface of the vessel where it touches the blood. For that reason, there is strong adherence of the partitioning agent and the inner surface of the wall of the collection vessel, so that the separation of serum and the blood clot can be complete. For that reason, it is assumed by the inventors that inorganic ions from the blood clot do not pass through a layer of water molecules on the inner surface of the wall to reach the layer of serum. Therefore, the serum obtained by separation in a centrifuge can be stored for long periods of time at low temperatures. When the vacuum blood collection tube of the present invention is used, it is possible to store the serum at As mentioned above, when the vacuum blood collection tube of the present invention, made of specific fabricative materials, is used, the whole blood sample that is collected coagulates in a short time, and the serum and the blood clot are effectively separated by the step of centrifugation. Moreover, after centrifugation as well, the serum can be stored in the same collection tube, so that the collection tube may also be used as a storage tube. In order that the oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor in the atmosphere are completely shut out, and that the low pressure inside of the tube can be maintained for long periods of time, the above mentioned vacuum blood collection tube is preferably wrapped in a plastic wrapping. As a wrapping technique by which a container to be wrapped is prevented from touching the outer parts thereof, there is a vacuum wrapping method in which the space between the inner wrapping and the outer wrapping is a vacuum. There is also a gas filled wrapping method in which the space therebetween is filled with a gas. The method of gas filled wrapping is used to prevent the acidification of food products, to prevent the growth of molds and bacteria, to prevent oxidation of electrical parts, welding rods, and other metal materials, and to prevent rusting. There are a great many gases that can be used for the filling, but ordinarily, nitrogen or carbon dioxide are used separately or in a mixture with a specific ratio of the two. This invention was completed based on knowledge of the inventors that the above mentioned vacuum blood collection tube is wrapped in a plastic wrapping and the space therebetween is filled with a gas that does not permeate either of these materials and that is at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, and thus the low pressure conditions inside the vacuum tube can be maintained for a long period of time. According to a prefered embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum blood collection tube is wrapped in a plastic wrapping material, and the space between the tube shaped vacuum blood collection tube and the plastic wrapping material is filled with a gas, which does not readily permeate either the tube or the plastic wrapping. The pressure of the gas is established at greater than atmospheric pressure. Thus, the problems with the ability of a plastic wrapping to act as a gas barrier are solved. This solution is based on the use of the following principles of reverse osmosis By use of a pressure greater than osmotic pressure through a semipermeable membrane, it is possible to suppress the movement of chemical species through that membrane. Therefore, when the inside of the plastic wrapping is filled with a gas, this prevents the permeation of gases in the atmosphere, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor into the inside of the wrapping. Thus, the plastic vessel shaped like a tube, made of polyethyleneterephthalate, a copolymer of polyethyleneterephthalate, an acrylonitrile resin, etc., is not touched by such gases, and the low pressure existing inside the tube can be maintained for long periods of time. Because the gas used for filling also has the function of protecting the tube shaped vessel, this vessel is not damaged by shock to the outside of the wrapping. For the above mentioned plastic wrapping material, all known plastics can be used. A preferable plastic wrapping is, for example, a laminate of a film composed of at least one of ethylene vinylalcohol copolymer, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylidenechloride, polyvinylchloride, plyethyleneterephthalate, nylon, another film composed of at least one of polyethylene, polypropylene. This provides for a light, non bulky, and inexpensive packing material. It is also possible to use aluminum foil covered with polyethylene or polyester. As the gas to be used for filling the space, any gas that has a vapor pressure at ordinary temperatures that is greater than atmospheric pressure can be selected. For example, hydrocarbon derivatives of one to four carbon atoms, in which fluorines, chlorines or bromines are substituted for hydrogen atoms alcohols of one to four carbon atoms in which fluorines, chlorines, or bromines are substituted for hydrogen atoms ethers of one to four carbon atoms in which fluorines, chlorines, or bromines are substituted for hydrogen atoms alkanes of one to four carbon atoms in which fluorines, chlorines, or bromines are substituted for hydrogen atoms inert gases such as nitrogen, argon, and xenon can be used. Of the above, nitrogen and freon gas are most preferable for use. Of these gases, the gas to be used depends on the raw materials used in the construction of the tube shaped vessel of the vacuum blood collection tube and of the wrapping materials, and an appropriate choice is of a gas that does not readily permeate either of the two. By not readily permeating is meant a gas permeation value of 2cm³ m² 24h 98100 Pa or less at The following Examples illustrate the invention. Carbinol modified silicone oil, which was prepared by the introduction of hydroxyl groups into polydimethylsiloxane, as the hydrophilic substance polyvinylpyrrolidone as the water soluble substance and finely powdered silica with a mean diameter of Two kinds of tube shaped vessels with a capacity of On each inner surface of these tube shaped vessels, the above mentioned dispersion liquid was sprayed, and after air drying, the inner gas thereof was removed and the vessels were sealed with a butyl rubber stopper, resulting in two kinds of vacuum blood collection tubes. The pressure within both of these kinds is set so as to obtain a blood sample volume of Each vacuum blood collection tube obtained is used to sample human fresh blood, and each is left at After coagulation of the blood, each vacuum blood collection tube is centrifuged at Seventy parts by weight of chlorinated polybutene with a specific gravity of One gram of this partitioning agent is placed into each of the two kinds of blood collection tubes obtained by the methods of Example Using the resultant vacuum blood collection tube and sample, the coagulability of the blood and the condition of the separation of the serum are observed in the same manner as in Example To observe the ability of such vessels to act as storage vessels for serum, each vacuum blood collection tube was stored in a refrigerator at Two vacuum blood collection tubes made of glass with a capacity of Vacuum blood collection tubes made of polyethyleneterephthalate in the same manner as in Example Variations in the amount of blood sampled in vacuum blood collection tubes were looked for under the same conditions as in Example The same vacuum blood collection tubes and laminated film with the ability to act as a gas barrier as in Example The extent of the vacuum in the sample tube has changed, so that the amount of blood sampled has decreased compared to Example Vacuum blood collection tubes were unwrapped and then studied in the same manner as for Example In the accompanying drawing, Figure This invention, as mentioned above, provides a vacuum blood collection tube in which whole blood samples that have been collected coagulate in a short period of time, and that are centrifuged, resulting in an effective separation of the serum and the blood clot. In this kind of vacuum blood collection tube, serum can be stored after the step of centrifugation, and the serum obtained can be stored for long periods of time at low temperatures. The space between the vacuum blood collection tube and the wrapping used to wrap the tube is filled with a gas that does not readily permeate either of these tube and wrapping materials and that is at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. Because of this gas filling, the low pressure conditions of the inside of the tube shaped vessel can be maintained with certainty over a long period of time. The ability of this wrapping to act as a gas barrier is much better than that of the wrapping used on conventional vacuum wrappings. The flexibility, lightness, and non bulkiness of this wrapping is excellent, and it does not damage the vacuum tube. It is inexpensive, as well.
