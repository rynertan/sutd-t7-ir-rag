## Description
The present invention relates to wideband amplifier circuit configurations. A typical amplifier circuit embodying the teachings of the prior art is shown in Figure 1. This circuit has an inherent shortcoming that limits its usefulness in high frequency applications. This shortcoming results primarily from the use of voltage feedback. The inverting and non inverting inputs of operational amplifier Ac are high impedance nodes, so the feedback voltage Ve VoR1 R1 R2 , assuming Vin 0 for ease of analysis. Then, since Vo Ac Vni Ve , Vo Vn1 G 1 G Ac , where G 1 R2 R1. Substituting for Ac Zc Pc, where Zc and Pc are complex polynomial expressions of zeros and poles that are functions of frequency, Vo Vni G 1 GPc Zc . Thus, G not only scales the magnitude of the closed loop gain as desired, it also multiplies the effect of Pc on the closed loop response. The closed loop pole locations are now a function of G. Thus, if G is made large, bandwidth will be inversely proportional to G. In practice, high frequency response is limited because of the presence of multiple poles and zeros, and it becomes necessary to compensate the amplifier at each value of G in order to achieve the best response. In many cases, achieving stability and freedom from oscillation severely limits the performance of the amplifier. The effect of employing current feedback rather than voltage feedback in amplifier configurations is described in US A 4 358 739 and 4 502 020, and can be explained briefly with reference again to Figure 1. Assuming that only the non inverting input of operational amplifier Ac has a high input impedance, and that the inverting input is a virtual ground with respect to the non inverting input independent of the effect of feedback from resistor R2, then it can be shown that Vo Vni G 1 R2Pc Zc . Resistor R2 has now replaced G in the denominator of the previous equation. Since resistor R2 can be held constant while resistor R1 changes to give the desired value of G, the frequency response and other related characteristics remain constant. Thus, the amplifier can be designed for optimum performance at any gain without having to compensate as before. In both voltage and current feedback types of amplifiers described in the preceding two paragraphs, the factor G is equal to R2 R1 in the case of inverting gain. The present invention accordingly provides a wideband feedback amplifier comprising first and second inputs, an output and first amplifier means having an input connected to the first amplifier input, characterised in that the amplifier further comprises differential amplifier means having a non inverting input connected to the output of said first amplifier means, an inverting input, and an output, first resistor means connected between the inverting and non inverting inputs of said differential amplifier means, second resistor means connected between the second amplifier input and the inverting input of the differential amplifier means, and third resistor means connected between the amplifier output and the inverting input of said differential amplifier means. Such a wideband amplifier is advantageous in that the two amplifier means are connected in such a way that closed loop current feedback, rather than voltage feedback, dominates the closed loop gain of the wideband amplifier configuration. Such an amplifier achieves a very wide bandwidth characteristic with the 3dB bandwidth and other parameters which can be made independent of the closed loop gain settings over a wide range. In a preferred embodiment, the first amplifier means comprises a further differential amplifier means having an inverting input which is connected to the inverting input of said differential amplifier means, the first amplifier input being connected to the non inverting input of the further differential amplifier means. A prior art amplifier has already been described and two embodiments of a wideband feedback amplifier in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Referring now to Figure 2, amplifier Aa has a response defined by Vd Vni Ve Za Pa where Za and Pa are complex polynomial expressions of zeros and poles that are functions of frequency. Similarly, amplifier Ab has a response defined by Vo Vd Ve Zb Pb. When these two amplifiers are interconnected as illustrated in Figure 2, the overall input output transfer function is derived as follows let Vin 0 to solve for the non inverting gain assume that the input impedance of Aa and Ab is infinite then, solving Vni VdX Ve, 0 VoY Vd Ve, and 0 VoG2 VdG Ve G G1 G2 simultaneously, where X Pa Za, Y Pb Zb, G 1 R, G1 1 R1, and G2 1 R2, the result is Vo Vni 1 R2 R1 1 Y 1 X R2 R X 1 R2 R1 X . For inverting gains, only the numerator of this equation changes, and is equal to R2 R1. To understand the effect of the denominator on frequency response, let X 0. The denominator equals 1 R2Pb RZb . It can be seen that this frequency dependent term is not a function of R1 as it is in a conventional operational amplifier. Therefore, the 3dB bandwidth and other related parameters are not influenced by the closed loop gain setting. In effect, amplifier Aa creates a low inverting input impedance so that Ve is independent of R1 and R2. This prevents an error voltage from existing at Ve, but does cause an error current Iinv Vo Ve R2 Ve Vin R1 to flow through resistor R. This is a current feedback situation. The voltage IinvR is presented to the inputs of amplifier Ab, and amplifier Ab, resistor R, and resistor R2 then determine the frequency response of the overall amplifier, independent of resistor R1 which does, however, set the closed loop again. In the case where X is not equal to 0 meaning amplifier Aa is not an ideal amplifier , feedback is a mixture of current and voltage feedback. The presence of voltage feedback, from the term YX 1 R2 R1 in the denominator, allows variations from the ideal response to occur. By appropriately choosing the value of the quantity Y R, frequency response can be controlled within the limitations imposed by the characteristics of X. Referring now to Figure 3, amplifier Ad has a response defined by Vd Vni Zd Pd where Zd and Pd are complex polynomial expressions of zeros and poles that are functions of frequency. Similarly, amplifier Ae has a response defined by Vo Vd Ve Ze Pe. When these two amplifiers are interconnected as illustrated in Figure 3, the overall input output transfer function is derived as follows let Vin 0 to solve for the non inverting gain assume that the input impedance of Ad and Ae is infinite then, solving Vni VdU 0 VoW Vd Ve, and 0 VoG2 VdG Ve G G1 G2 simultaneously, where U Pd Zd, W Pe Ze, G 1 R, G1 1 R1, and G2 1 R2, the result is Vo Vni 1 R2 R1 U 1 R2 G G1 . For inverting gains, only the numerator of this equation changes, and is equal to R2 R1. To understand the effect of the denominator on frequency response, let R be much smaller than R1. The denominator equals U 1 W 1 R2G . It can be seen that this frequency dependent term is not a function of R1 as it is in a conventional operational amplifier. Therefore, the 3dB bandwidth and other related parameters are not influenced by the closed loop gain setting. In effect, amplifier Ad creates a low inverting input impedance so that Ve is independent of R1 and R2. This prevents an error voltage from existing at Ve, but does cause an error current Iinv Vo Ve R2 Ve Vin R1 to flow through resistor R. This is a current feedback situation. The voltage IinvR is presented to the inputs of amplifier Ae, and amplifier Ae, resistor R, and resistor R2 then determine the frequency response of the overall amplifier, independent of resistor R1 which does, however, set the closed loop gain. In the case where resistor R is not significantly smaller than resistor R1, a strong voltage feedback component exists as well.
