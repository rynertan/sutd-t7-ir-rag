# CMOS Semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A complementary type MOS transistor device is disclosed including a p channel type MOS transistor having source, drain and gate regions 10, 12, 20 formed in the n well region 6 which is formed in the surface area of a p type semiconductor layer 4 and an n channel MOS transistor having source, drain and gate regions 13, 14, 22 formed in said semiconductor layer 4 . The semiconductor layer 4 is formed on an n type semi conductor body 2 and a reverse bias voltage is applied between the semiconductor layer 4 and the semiconductor substrate 2 .
