# DEVICE FOR THE TRANSFER OF MATERIAL BETWEEN A SUBSTANTIALLY HORIZONTAL AND A SUBSTANTIALLY VERTICAL SCREW CONVEYOR

## Abstract
Device for the transfer of material between a substantial ly horizontal 13 and a substantially vertical screw conveyor 1 which are located in the same vertical plane, in which the upper end of the screw 10 in the vertical conveyor is located in the substantially same horizontal plane as the centre axis of the horizontal conveyor and in which the casing of the vertical conveyor at the upper end of the screw is designed in such a way that the material at the upper end is subject to a radial force directed towards the horizontal conveyor and in which the vertical conveyor is turnable in relation to the horizontal conveyor around a horizontal axis perpendicular to said horizontal plane.
