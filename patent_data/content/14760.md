# Idling and air replenishing system for a reciprocating hammer mechanism.

## Abstract
Hammertool with a reciprocating piston member 35 slideably positioned in a barrel 27 and moving between a forward limit position and a rearward limit position. An air passageway 31 open to air is formed in the barrel 27 and a first passageway 43 and a second passageway 41 are formed in the piston member 35 . In the operational mode, a ram 54 and the barrel 27 coact to alternately seal and expose an enclosure 73 to the outside air through the first passageway 43 and air passageway 31 whereby the ram 54 is urged axially toward or away from the tool bit through the pressure differentials established thereby in the enclosure 73 . The second passageway 41 is formed in a forward portion 39 and is spaced a predetermined distance away from the first passageway 43 such that the second passage way 41 communicates with the air passageway 31 to ensure that air is supplied to the enclosure 73 during the course of the movement of the piston member 35 from said forward limit position to said rearward limit position when the hammer tool is operating in the idle mode. In this way, the ram 54 remains inactive when the tool bit is removed or when the tool is lifted from the work surface because no significant pressure differentials are developed in the enclosure 73 .
