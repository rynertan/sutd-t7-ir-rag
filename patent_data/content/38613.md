Among the adjacently disubstituted ketones of formula 5 a that can be produced by the process ofApplication No. 80301617.9 are novel prostaglandin analogs, some of which can be used in pharmaceutical compositions as an active ingredient. The novel prostaglandin analogs provided by the present invention are 7 hydroxyprostaglandins E1, the stereoisomers thereof, or the protected derivatives thereof having the formula A EMI4.1 wherein Rl represents a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or an ethyl group, R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R3 and R4 are identical or different, and each represents a hydrogen atom, a tetrahydropyranyl group or a t butyldimethylsilyl group. Formula A embraces compounds of the formulae EMI4.2 andEMI5.1 either singly or as mixtures in arbitrary ratios R11 R3 4 and R in the three formulae B , C and D are as defined with respect to formula A . Among the compounds of formula A provided by this invention, 7 hydroxyprostaglandin E1 or stereoisomers thereof having the formula E EMI5.2 can be produced by subjecting the 7 hydroxyprostaglandinE1 or its stereoisomer corresponding to formula A in which R1, R3 and R4 are protected by groups other than hydrogen and obtained by the process of Application No.80301617.9 in which the second reaction with the protected acetal derivative of formula 4 a is performed using an acetal derivative of an aldehyde, to a known procedure, for example, hydrolysis under acidic or alkaline conditions, or microbial hydrolysis. Investigations have led to the discovery that the 7 hydroxyprostaglandin E1 and its stereoisomers of formula E have superior anti thrombotic activity and anti ulcer activity. Accordingly, the present invention further provides an anti thrombotic composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of the 7 hydroxyprostaglandin E1 or a stereoisomer thereof of formula E and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. These compounds can be administered to mammals including man when it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation and to inhibit or prevent thrombus formation.Thus, these compounds are useful for various prophylactic and therapeutic purposes such as the prevention of cardiovascular infarctions and post operative thrombosis, the promotion of potency of vascular prostheses after surgical operation, and the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis. They can also be used to prevent onset of cerebral ischemia in patients suffering from senile diseases, and to prevent or treat myocardial infarction and apoplexy for a long period of time after a seizure. For these purposes, the compounds of this invention can be administered perorally, intrarectally, or parenterally e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly . Preferably, they are administered parenterally. For peroral administration, the compounds of the invention are formulated into solid or liquid preparations. Solid preparations include tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid preparations, at least one active compound is mixed with at least one inert diluent such as calcium carbonate, potato starch, alginic acid or lactose. Other additives such as lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate may also be included. Drug formulation is performed in a customary manner. Liquid preparations for oral administration include emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs and a general pharmaceutically acceptable inert diluent such as water or liquid paraffin. In addition to the inert diluent, these pharmaceutical preparations contain auxiliary agents such as wetting agents, suspending aids, sweetenings, flavouring agents, perfumes or antiseptics. The liquid preparations may be encapsulated in absorbable materials such as gelatin. Solid preparations for intrarectal administration include suppositories containing at least one active compound and prepared by a method known per se. Preparations for parenteral administration are aseptic aqueous or non aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Non aqueous solutions or suspensions contain propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. These preparations can also include auxiliary .agents such as antiseptics, wetting agents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents. These preparations can be sterilised, for example, by filtration through a bacteriumholding filter, mixing of a bactericide, or by irradiation.Alternatively, aseptic solid preparations are first produced, and immediately prior to use, dissolved in aseptic water or an aseptic solvent for injection. The dosage of the 7 hydroxyprostaglandin E1 or its stereoisomer, an active compound in accordance with this invention, is about 0.1 pg to about 100 mg, preferably about ljig to about 10 mg, per day per kilogram of body weight. Of course, the dosage depends upon the condition, body weight and age of a patient and the route of administration. According to this invention, there is also provided an anti thrombotic composition containing the 7 hydroxyprostaglandin E1 or its stereoisomer of formula E as an inclusion compound of cyclodextrin. By converting the active compound into an inclusion compound of cyclodextrin, the stability of the 7 hydroxyprostaglandin or its stereoisomer increases to make it suitable for oral administration. The inclusion compound can be prepared by dissolving cyclodextrin in water and or a water miscible organic solvent, and adding the solution to a solution of the 7 hydroxyprostaglandin compound in a water miscible organic solvent. The mixture may be warmed when the desired cyclodextrin inclusion compound can be isolated by concentration under reduced pressure or the mixture may be cooled and the desired product isolated by filtration or decantation. The ratio of the organic solvent to water varies depending upon the solubilities of the starting materials and the product.Preferably, during the production of the cyclodextrin inclusion compound, the temperature should not exceed.700C. a , P , or y cyclodextrin or mixtures thereof can be used in the production of the cyclodextrin inclusion compound.
