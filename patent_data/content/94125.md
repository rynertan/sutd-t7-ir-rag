# Method and device for positioning light conducting fibres.

## Abstract
The fibre to be positioned 5, 7 is irradiated locally transversely by means of an ultraviolet light source 19 with ultraviolet light of such a wavelength that fluorescence is produced in the core 10, 12 of the fibre 5, 7 . The vis ible light produced in the core 10, 12 by the fluorescence is used to make observations for the visual control. In this manner, cores of light conducting fibres can be positioned very accurately even when they are arranged eccentrically in the cladding.
