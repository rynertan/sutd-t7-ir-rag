# Nickel based casting alloy.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to low fusing nickel base alloys, particularly nickel base alloys comprising by weight percent about Ni 52 84 Cr 10 25 Cb Nb 3 10 Mn 3 8 Be 0.5 2.0 which are useful for cast metallic structures for dental prosthetic devices or for cast jewelry. The alloys of the present invention are particularly useful for preparing cast structures in gypsum bonded investments.
