## Abstract
An apparatus 10 for separating heavy solids from an effluent, for example wool scouring effluent, comprising a tank having a solids discharge 14a outlet at its base and an ultra sonic sensor 28 located at a predetermined distance from this outlet. Means responsive to the output of the sensor, for example a solonoid controled valve, are provided for opening the discharge outlet when the solids concentra tion exceeds the preset limit. Preferably, a secondary settlement tank 24 immediately below and directly com municating with the main tank 10 is provided and the discharge outlet 28 , controlled by a suitable valve, is at the base of the secondary tank. The secondary tank has a zone offset from the main solid flow in which the sensor may be located in order that large aggregates of solids do not lead to spurious operation of the sensor.
