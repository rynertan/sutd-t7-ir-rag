# IMPROVED YEAST STRAINS, METHOD OF PRODUCTION AND USE IN BAKING

## Abstract
Novel biologically pure quick acting bakers yeast strains NRRL Y 15338 and NRRL Y 15339 are provided which show good performance in sweet, regular, and lean doughs, and su perior performance in sweet and lean doughs, particularly when used in the active dry yeast form. A method of obtaining these and other novel bakers yeast strains by hybridization via protoplast fusion of petite mutants is also provided. Improved methods of baking using these novel bakers yeasts especially in the active dry yeast form are also provided.
