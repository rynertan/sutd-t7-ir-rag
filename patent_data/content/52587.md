# A die for compaction of powder.

## Abstract
A die for compacting powder by dynamic compaction. The die is intended for compaction pressures substantially above 1 GPa. The die is made of a mixture of a plastic material and a metal powder. The die has tne same density before compaction as the powder to be compacted. Furth ermore, the die undergoes the same increase in density during compaction as the powder being compacted. The die is cheap relative to a steel die and can, thus, be made for single use. The range of geometries possible to compact is greatly extended.
