# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TIME RELATED FEE DETERMINATION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
In automatic car parking systems it has been known to provide at entry a ticket which is encoded with the time of entry. This requires encoding at the entrance gates. This invention proposes providing tickets carrying a serial number and not the time. The time is instead held in a store 2 in association with the coded number. At exit the serial number read by a ticket reader 4 and is used to call up the entrance time. The two times are compared by circuits 7 10 to calcu late the fee due and this is collected at an appropriate cash unit 5 . It is applicable to other time related services in addition to or instead of car parking. Where several services are com bined payment may be effected individually or by a single payment. The same ticket may be used to gain entry to non time related services and the fee therefor collected with the time related fee.
