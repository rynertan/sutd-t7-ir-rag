# Setting device for protective control system.

## Abstract
Digital setting value data, having been stored in a first non volatile memory 1 in response to the operation of a first switch 4 , is transferred to and memorized in a second non volatile memory 2 . Stored setting value data is read out from at least one of the first and second memories 1 and 2 under the control of and address control circuit 6 and coupled to a digital processing section 7 for carrying out digital arithmetic processing for protective control in the processor.
