## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This application is a continuation in part application of prior copending application Ser.No. 59937, filed April 12, 1984. This invention relates to novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to the production thereof, to compositions containing them, and to their use in the treatment or management of conditions or diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, in which collagenase promoted collagen breakdown is a causative factor. We have now found a group of compounds which act as inhibitors of mammalian collagenase which initiates collagen breakdown. Extensive proteolytic enzyme promoted degradation of articular cartilage is associated with joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. Collagen is one of the major components of the protein matrix of joint cartilage and bone. Histological observations of rheumatoid lesions have established that such lesions are characterized by the proliferation of synovial lining cells with subsequent neovascularization and infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells, collectively referred to as soft tissue or wpannus . The importance of such soft tissue in cartilage erosion has been well demonstrated. Evanson and coworkers, for example, found that large amounts of neutral collagenase are produced by pannus tissue LEvanson, J.M., et al., Arthritis Rheum., 21, 2639 2651, 1968 . More recently, others have confirmed that neutral collagenase plays an important degradative role in the arthritic joints of experimental animals Lsee Cambray, et al., Rheumatol Int. 1, 11 16 and 17 28, 1981 and in humans Cawston, et al., Arthritis Rheum., 27, 285 29, 1984 . A mono specific antiserum to purified synovial collagenase has been used to localize the enzyme in rheumatoid tissues Wooley, et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 69, 421 428, 19761. Immunoreactive collagenase was detected in high density at the cartilage pannus junction the site of joint erosion but not in the cartilage matrix or synovial tissue remote from the cartilage pannus junction Wooley, et al., Arthritis Rheumatism, 20, 1231 1349. Wooley, et al., Science, 200, 773 775, 1978 have further identified a sub population of synovial cells responsible for collagenase production. Thus, the foregoing observations have provided conclusive evidence that collagenase is directly involved in the cartilage erosion process seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention which specifically inhibit mammalian collagenase are pharmacologically useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases in which collagenolytic activity is a contributing factor, such as corneal ulceration, peridontal disease, tumor invasion, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, etc. These compounds have substantially no angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibiting activity. ACE inhibitors are described in European Appl. No. A 0012401.ACE is a carboxydipeptidase it cleaves a peptide substrate two residues from the C terminus. Consequently the C terminal carboxylic acid is a prime recognition site for both substrates and inhibitors removal of this ionic binding group drastically reduces inhibitory potency.Collagenase, on the other hand, is an endopeptidase and, as such, has no prerequisite for this binding interaction. Additionally, the structure of collagen differs essentially from angiotensin I which is a decapeptide and is cleaved at a phenylalanine histidine bond to give an octapeptide angiotensin II and a dipeptide histidylleucine . Collagen is much more complex, in being a triple helix, each strand of the helix containing of the order of 1,000 amino acid residues, the sequence of amino acids around the site cleaved by collagenase being completely different from that around the cleavage site of Angiotensin I. Collagenase cleaves this triple helix at a single locus on each chain approximately two thirds of the way along the chain from the N terminus.The amide bond which is cleaved by collagenase is either a glycine leucine or a glycine isoleucine bond.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides compounds of the general formula I EMI3.1 EMI3.2 and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof wherein R 2 represents hydroxy, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aralkoxy or substituted alkoxy wherein the substituent is selected from alkylaminocarbonyl or the groupEMI3.3 R 3 represents alkylamino or aralkylamino and the stereochemistry of the carbon atom marked by the asterisk is R, S or a diastereomeric mixture thereof with R configuration being preferred. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The term alkyl as used herein to designate a group or a part thereof includes reference to both straight and branched alkyl groups and to cycloalkyl groups which may contain from I to 1, preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms in the case of straight or branched chain non cyclic alkyl groups for example methyl, ethyl, propyl,isopropyl and from 3 to 10, preferably 3 to 7 in the case of cyclic alkyl groups for example cyclopentyl, norbornyl . By the term aryl, is meant phenyl or naphthyl. The terms aralkyl and aralkoxy include in particular those groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion, and those groups in which aryl has the meaning just given. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts are those derived from mineral and organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, p toluene sulphonic, sulphuric, perchloric, acetic, benzoic, trifluoroacetic and the like. There are several chiral centres in the compounds according to the invention because of the presence of asymmetric carbon atoms. These centres may be racemised or in any optically active form, as well as comprise R, S or diastereomeric mixture. The compounds according to the invention exhibit inhibitory action against collagenase. This was determined following the procedure of Cawston andBarrett, Anal. Biochem., 99, 340 345 1979 whereby the lmM of the inhibitor being tested or dilutions thereof are incubated at 37 0C for 16 hours with native collagen and collagenase buffered with Tris BCl CaC12 14 pH 7.6 . The collagen is acetyl C collagen. The samples are centrifuged to sediment undigested collagen and an aliquot of the radiactive supernatant removed for assay on a scintillation counter as a measure of hydrolysis. The collagenase activity in the presence of lmM inhibitor, or a dilution thereof, is compared to activity in a control devoid of inhibitor and the results reported as that inhibitor concentration effecting 5 inhibition of the collagenase. Table II illustrates the activity of compounds of this invention. For use in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis the compounds of this invention can be administered by any convenient route preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such route and in a dose effective for the intended treatment. In the treatment of arthritis administration may conveniently be by the oral route or by injection intraarticularly into the affected joint.The daily dosage for a 7 kilogram mammal will be in the range of 1B milligrams to 1 gram. The compounds of this invention can be formulated in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administrationor in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. About 90 to 500 og of a compound according to the invention is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavour, etc., in a unit dosage from as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. See for example, Remingtonts Pharmaceutical Science Mach Publishing Co., Easton, Penn. 1965 . The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. The compounds according to the invention may be made by methods which are generally known in peptide chemistry for analogous compounds. In particular it is to be understood that reactive groups not involved in a particular reaction e.g. amino, carboxy, hydroxy etc., may be protected by methods standard in peptide chemistry prior to reactions of other groups and subsequently deprotected. The intermediates of use in the production of the end products are either knawn compounds or can be made by known methods, as described in the Examples. In order that the invention may be more fully understood the following Exarrples are given by way of illustration and should not limit the invention in spirit or scope.

The therapeutic effectiveness is assessed in the rat model of inflammatory arthritis described byTrentham et al. 1977 . In this model, the arthritis, induced by an intradermal injection of Type II collagen, generally develops in both hind paws and the progression and severity of the lesion are monitored by physical measurements of the malleolar width and ankle extensibility. The compound of Example II in the present specification was administered by intraperitoneal injections at 100 mg kg twice daily for 21 days commencing seven days after the injection of the disease. The results of the foregoing test are set forth in Table Ilibelow.

Evidence of a therapeutic effect was denoted by a significant reduction in malleolar width and a significant increase in ankle extension. Both measurements were carried out on apparatus designed for the purpose. Area under the curve data from tbese time course experiments was examinaed by non parametric statistical analysis.The prednisolone standard was given at a dose of 5.62mg kg b.i.d. Prednisolone was chosen as a standard since steroids are known to be effective both clinically in Rheumatoid Arthritis and in animal models of arthritis.ReferencesTrentham, D.E., Townes, A.S.
