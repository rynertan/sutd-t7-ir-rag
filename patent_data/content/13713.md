The primary amine reactant R can, in preferred and specific aspect, be of the formula I b given above, provided, however, that h and R4 therein are hydrogen, to give the primary amine function. An alternative process for making certain of the surfactants utilizes a novel reaction between the amine reactant and a cyclic hydroxypropylene containing phosphate ester reactant, to produce 3 hydroxypropylphosphobetaine, as shown schematically below for a tertiary amine reactant EMI13.1 wherein the reactants are defined as before, it being understood that the anion X can be supplied by the halide Hal group which is split from reactant IVa or VIa in which case X Hal or from another source, as explained above. The designations HO C3H5 or C3H50H herein refer to a hydroxypropylene function in which the hydroxy can be linked to any one of the three carbons and the cyclic oxa moiety is linked to one of the three carbons, either at the 3 or 2 position of the propyl group. The reactions proceed in the same manner using primary amines R or secondary amines R , instead of the tertiary amine R shown, it being understood that use of secondary amines can give bis compounds as in Reaction 7 , supra, and use of primary amines can give bis or tris compounds, as shown inReactions 10 and 11 , supra, when the cyclic phosphate reactant is supplied in appropriate multiple molar ratio 2 1 or 3 1, respectively . The reactants required in the processes can be prepared as follows Preparation of Intermediate Amine Reactants The amine reactants R R , and R are known or are generally prepared in accordance with conventional techniques.For instance, when making a tertiary amine R of the amidoamine type Ib , this can be prepared by reacting an acid with an aminoalkyl substituted tertiary or secondary or primary, in the case of R and R amine to result in the amidoamine function. Alternatively, an acid can be reacted with an aminoalkyl substi tuted secondary or primary amine, followed by further treatment of the reaction product with alkylene oxide, to give the tertiary or secondary reactants, respectively.

This cyclic reactant can be prepared as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,267,965. Preparation of Phosphate Ester Intermediate Reactants The preparation of the phosphate ester intermediate reactants I a through VIII a as set forth in the reaction sequences above are also prepared by reactions which are illustrated as follows EMI16.1 A wide variety of commercially available amines are suitable for these reactions. The amines can.be primary, secondary or tertiary with only the proviso that the total number of carbons be greater than 6, i.e., to give a hydrophobe necessary for surface active properties. All other substitutions and modifications of the amine are usable in the present process. Of the commercially available aliphatic amines, there may be mentioned Armeen Armak Chemical , e.g., octyl amine through dodecyl amine.Illustrative aliphatic secondary amines 9f simi lar molecular weight include such secondary atnines as the Armeen 2C dicocamine through the disoya amine, tallow aminc.Tertiary amines may be simple aliphatic tertiary amines such as the type alkyl dimethyl amine, dialkyl methyl amine, and trialkyl amine, marketed by Armak Chemical Company and an example is Armeen DM14D which is the N tetradecyl dimethyl amine . iurtitcr, ethoxylated aliphatic anilines can also be used.These products are marketed under the names of Ethameen . vAny substitution is possible as illustrated elsewhere herein. The cyclic phosphate ester intermediate reactants required for the alternative synthesis routes 12 and 13 supra, can be prepared as follows EMI18.1 It will be noted that Reactions 23 and 24 utilize reactants similar to the reactants needed in Reactions 17 and 18 supra although with the more limited hydroxypropyl definition , but that different, cyclic, products are obtained. The different products are the result of a different pll adjustment thus, while reaction 17 is carried out at a pH of about 4 5, reaction 18 is carried out at a pH of 9.5 to 10.5, resulting in a cyclic product.This cyclic product may contain also some vicinal epoxy material so that the formulaEMI19.1 should be understood as including not only one or more of the isomers resulting from linkage of the oxa oxygen to any one of the hydroxy propylene carbons t6 make a 5 , or 6 membered ring , but also the following structure EMI19.2 Operation at a higher pH, e.g., 10.5 or higher, favors formation of the vicinal epoxy containing material. The reaction of epichlorohydrin with phosphoric acid and various phosphate salts has not been investigated to an appreciable extent and very little has been written in the literature on this reaction. We have observed that a variety of products can be obtained with variation of certain experimental parameters. The most important of these parameters include the pH of the phosphate salt, the mole ratio of the phosphate salt to the epichlorohydrin and the temperature at which the reaction is run. Reactions No. 16 through 18 occur in an acidic, aqueous solution. Consequently, the reaction proceeds by attack at the epoxide resulting in a 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl phosphate intermediate.This intermediate, containing a labile organic chlorine, is reacted with certain nucleophilic species such as amine to give the product conforming to the general phosphobetaine structure. The pH at which this reaction occurs must be strictly contolled. The desired pH range is from 4 to 5. If the pH drops below 4 there is significant hydrolysis of the phosphate ester.If the pH at which the reaction is run is too high, there will be loss of labile organic chlorine. When the reaction is carried out in an alkaline environment of a pH 9.5 10.5 optimally, the resulting intermediate had surprisingly lost its labile organic chlorine and formed a cyclic diester . This diester is quite resistant to hydrolysis but extremely reactive towards certain nucleophilic species. This nucleophilic attack, particularly under conditions at which it is maximized, coupled with the proper selection of amine having a hydrophobic nature makes thisprocess of the invention a commercially viable procedure for preparing surface active agents possessing unusual and valuable properties. The following conditions represent preferred operating conditions 1 The reaction should be carried out in an aqueous environment at a concentration of the reactants of 30 50 based on total solution the balance being water most preferably the reactants constitute about 40 of the total reactant water mixture. 2 The phosphate salt used should have the pH of 9.5 10.5 before the additionof epichlorohydrin. This will allow for maximum formation of the cyclic phos phate diester. 3 The reaction is preferably initially conducted at a temperature of 80 850C under some pressure, e.g., 5 psig of nitrogen, to prevent azeotrope reflux. The temperature is gradually increased to 100C and held until theoretical inorganic chloride is generated. The reaction of epichlorohydrin with disodium and tri sodium phosphate has been described or reported in the literature O. Bailly, Compt. Rend. 172, 689 91 1921 C.A. 15, 1884 1921 and 0. Bailly, Bull. Soc. Chim. 4 31, 848 62 1922 C.A. 17, 264 1923 . In the reported reaction of disodium hydrogen phosphates with epichlorohydrin a diglycerophosphoric acid di ester was thought to have been obtained. As noted above, however we have found that the pH of this system has a profound effect on the product which is obtained. For example, by reacting NaH2P04 with epichlorohydrin, the following two products can be obtained, depending on the mole ratio of the two reactants. If one mole of epichlorohydrin is reacted, the product is 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl phosphate Intermediate Reactant A, below . If two moles are reacted, there is obtained bis 3 chloro2 hydroxypropyl phosphate Intermediate Reactant D , below.These reactions are carried out at a pll of 4 5. Under these conditions, as can be seen from the products obtained, the phosphoric acid moiety attacks the epoxy ring. As the pH is increased to form disodium phosphate, a nucleophilic attack occurs with a displacement of significant quantities of chloride ions. This is shown in the appended drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a plot showing the effect of pal on chloride generation. At a pll of 9.5 10.5, theoretical chloride generation is achieved. Although it was assumed that simultaneous attack was occurring at the epoxy moiety, it was surprisingly discovered that the epoxide group was being retained essentially intact.The product obtained under these conditions was 2,3 epoxymonosodium propyl phosphate Intermediate Reactant C , below .The presence of the epoxy group was subsequently verified by reaction with various amine compounds. The various intermediates were used to react with varibus primary, secondary and tertiary amines to form the ultimate amphoteric phosphobetaine compounds. Although similar product would be expected to be obtained when utilizing Intermediate Reactants A and C, distinctly different properties were found for products prepared from these two intermediates. In the case of Intermediate Reactant C, significantly higher foam ing products were obtained and this was later shown to be a function of p11 of the initial phosphate salt used this effect is depicted in the drawing wherein Fig. 2 is a graph captioned Foam Profile , which is a plot of foam height versus the pH of the initial phosphate salt used. One of the interesting phenomenon of these products is thus their pil dependent solubility. Not only are the products pll dependent, but they are also concentration dependent in that very dilute concentrations tend to become cloudy. The concen tration at which this clouding phenomenon occurs is affected by the pll of the initial phosphate salt. This is shown in the appended drwine wherein Fig. 3 is a plot of pH versus concentration at which cloudiness occurs. At a pM of 9.5 10.5, there is a leveling off of the solubility. As noted above, the process parameters must be controlled in order to maintain the reactive organic chlorine atom in the phosphate ester reactants and to avoid hydrolysis of these phosphate esters. Thus, the ply of the phosphate salt employed1 the temperature of the reaction and the reaction time were all found to be important in yielding the desired intermediate product. The nature of the intermediate product in turn has a profound effect on the properties of the final products. Indeed, the surprising reactivity of the cyclic phosphate ester intermediate reactants, like that of their Iabile chlorine containing analogues, while at the same time their stability against hydrolysis renders eminently suitable for use in the basic process of the invention to yield the ultimate surfactants. Ilhen amine reactants are employed, which are sufficiently hydrophobic to surfacc active, highly efficacious surface active products are produced.However, non surface active analogues can also be prepared by using low molecular weight or hydrophilic amines. Specific phosphate ester intermediate reactants which were prepared according to reaction sequences 16 22 supra and which were used in the examples, infra, in conjunction with certain tertiary amine reactants, are set forth below Phosphate Ester Intermediate Reactants Reactant A Prepared According to Reaction SequenceEMI24.1 Reactant B Prepared According to Reaction SequenceEMI24.2 Reactant C Prepared According to Reaction SequenceEMI25.1 and orEMI25.2 Reactant D Prepared According to Redaction SequenceEMI25.3 Reactant E Prepared according to Reaction SequenceEMI25.4 Reactant F Prepared according to the Reaction SequenceEMI25.5 Reactant G Prepared According to Reaction SequenceEMI25.6 Reactant II Prepared According to Reaction SequenceEMI25.7 In carrying out the reactiens 1 to 13 as set forth above leading to the ultimate compounds of the invention, the amine intermediate reactant R, R , or R , is reacted with the appropriate phosphate ester intermediate reactant and these reactions are generally carried out in an aqueous system at 80 1000C. The optimum concentration range of the reactants in reac tions 1 to 13 in aqueous solution is from 30 50 and most prefer ably the reactants constitute about 40 of the aqueous reactant mixture. In this respect, the preferred concentration are similar to those set forth above for certain intermediate reactions, e.g., in the preparation of the cyclic intermediates according to reactions 16 to 18 the resulting reactions product mixture, which pre ferably will contain about 40 of active reactants, inay be used as such in carrying out the final reaction. leading to the ultimate phosphorus containing surface active products. The phosphate ester reactant should have a pH of about 5 to 6 before the amine addition and the pH should be maintained at between 7 to 9 after said amine addition below a pH of 7 the rate of quaternization slows significantly and, of course, the pH of the amines used themselves limit the pH on the alkaline topside at about pH 9. As noted above, the reactions 1 to 13 are generally carried out at a temperature of about 80 1000C. The reaction is preferably initially conducted at a temperature of 80 1000C and may be conducted under some pressure, e.g., under 5 psig of nitro gen. However, under pressure, higher temperatures can be used, e.g., temperatures up to about 1300C and the ceiling temperature is determined by the sensitivity of the reactants, e.g., the amine reactant, since it will be found that color loss and evidence of other degredation occurs at unduly high temperatures. Many specific examples of ultimate phosphobetaine preparation are set forth below. The ultimate reaction products are good surfactants and quite unexpectedly exhibit good foam volume and superior foam stability in comparison to commercially available amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants. This was determined by an adaptation of the well known Ross Miles foam test principle Oil and Soap 18, 99 102 1941 in the following manner. Lanolin, anhydrous, cosmetic grade is mixed with dioxane technical grade in the proportion of 2.5 grams lanolin and 100 grams of dioxane. The lanolin is first mixed with 25 cc of dioxane. This mixture is heated over a steam bath to 450C in order to dissolve the lanolin in the dioxane. The remainder of the dioxane is then added and mixed. This lanolin dioxane solution, which is stored in an amber bottle, should be prepared fresh on the day that the tests are run. The composition to be tested is diluted by adding 376 cc of distilled water to 4 grams of the composition and then by adding 20 cc of the lanolin dioxane solution described above while mixing. Heat is produced when the lanolin dioxane solution is added to the solution of the composition in water and care must be taken in adjusting the temperature of this solution to 24 25 C. Both of these intermediate solutions should therefore be adjusted to 230C before mixing. The cooling of the lanolindioxane solution should be gradual in order to avoid precipita tion of the lanolin. This will produce a final solution with a temperature of 24 25 C. The final solution of the composition to be tested, water, dioxane and lanolin described above, is then run in a modified Ross Miles foam column in the usual way. All tests are conducted in duplicate, and the average of the two results is taken. Foam stability is determined by measuring the decay in foam height after two minutes, expressed as a percentage of the original height. Typical foam values obtained utilizing the above procedure for an alkylamidophosphobetaine, an alkylamido betaine and an alkylamido sultaine are listed below Example Foam Decay No. Volume ml After 2 min.Lauric Myristic Amido 3 liydroxypropyl Phos 10 250 4.0 phobetaineCocamido Disodium 3 Hydroxypropyl Phosphobetaine 9 240 10Cocamido Disodium EthylPhosphobetaine 47 210 19Cocamido Propyl betaine 225 31.0Cocamido Propylsultaine 200 60.0 As can be seen from the above results, the phosphobetaines made by the process of the invention exhibit excellent foam volume and stability, whereas the stability of the betaines and sultaines is significantly less. In another series of tests, additional species of the phosphobetaine compounds of the invention were tested by a cylinder shake test for the evaluation of foaming characteristics. In this test, test solutions containing 0.1 by weight of the candidate surfactant in water of 100 ppm hardness calcium to magnesium ration 3 2 were used and placed in 100 ml stoppered cylinders which had been cleaned so that water drains down its walls in an unbroken film. Each cylinder filled with test solution was shaken 20 times in a standard manner and net foam in ml is noted one minute and again five minutes after shaking. The test were run in three replicates.The results were as follows Example 1 5 LauriclMyristic Type Number Minute Minutes Lauric Myristic Amido Betaine 67 60Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 85 74Lauric Myristic Amido Monosodium Phosphobetaine 2 88 78Lauric Myristic AmidoDisodium Phosphobetaine 10 85 78Lauric Myristic AmidoGlyceryl Phosphobetaine 2 86 78Lauric Myristic Amido CarboxyDisodium Phosphobetaine 62 87 73N cocamidoethyl N hydroxyethyl glycine 76 67 Example 1 5 Coco Type Number Minute MinutesCocobetaine 65 56Cocamidobetaine 70 63Cocoamido MonosodiumPhosphobetaine 1 79 74Cocamido Glyceryl Phosphobetaine 20 71 74Coco Imidazoyl MonosodiumPhosphobetaine 37 83 78Coco Imidazoyl Di sodium Phosphobetaine 49 80 75Bis Coco Imidazoyl Phosphobetaine 63 75 69 In addition, the compounds of the present invention possess a surprisingly low ocular irritation potential when compared to commercially available amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants. The test employed is the modified Draize Test J.M. Draize et al, Toilet Goods Assn. No. 17, May, 1952, No. 1Proc.Sci.Sect. . In this method, a 0.1 1 ml sample of a neutral solution of the compound under investigation is dropped into one eye of an albino rabbit, the other eye serving as a control. Six rabbits are employed for each compound. Observations are made after 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours and 7 days after initial instillation second and third instillations are made after the 24 and 48 hour readings. Results may vary from substantially no change, or only a slight irritation in the appearance of the rabbit s eye after 7 days, to severe irritation and or complete corneal opacity. Ocular lesions are scored for the cornea, iris and conjunctiva with a higher number indicating greater ocular irritation and the scores are added to give a total numerical value for each reading for 6 rabbits and average. The averaged score is an indication of the irritation potential of the composition under test.
