# CENTRIFUGAL, INLINE, OPPOSED BALANCE GAS BLOWER

## Abstract
A centrifugal blower for use in moving gas at relatively high flow rates through a shaft within the housing for rotation therein, the housing having a pair of axially spaced plenum chambers with opposed impellers mounted on the shaft in secured relation and disposed in the respective chamber, for rotation with respect thereto to pressurize the gas. The blower is capable of providing a vacuum up to 18 inches of mercury at its inlet. A gas inlet for supplying gas to the blower chamber and a gas outlet for exiting pressurized gas from the blower chamber is provided for each of the chambers, with the gas inlet and the gas outlet being disposed in line, crosswise of the shaft, whereby minimum thrust forces are applied to the blower during operation thereof, resulting in a relatively long service life for the blower and especially the shaft bearings. The blower con struction is such that the shaft bearings may be expeditiously replaced if that becomes desirable or necessary, without disassembly of the entire blower.
