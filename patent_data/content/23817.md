# Form fill seal apparatus and method of making reclosable bags.

## Abstract
Bag forming material is obtained by feeding sheet material 2 together with male and female closure ele ments 5, 6 to a nip between guide roller 3 and pressure rollers 9, 10 at which adhesive is applied from nozzles 11, 12 . The resulting material is fed to an accumulator 16 on a continuous basis and then intermittently over a forming shoulder 21 into a tubular form 22 while main taining the closure elements 5, 6 at a predetermined dis tance apart before the forming shoulder 21 by means such as grooves 19 in guide roller 18 and locating the closure elements 5, 6 in predetermined positions facing each other downstream of the shaping shoulder by suitable means 23 which may include rotatable guide elements. The material is drawn through the apparatus by transverse reciprocating sealing bars 26 and a pilfer proof closure can be provided by vertical sealing bars 25 .
