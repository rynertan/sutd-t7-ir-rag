## Description
Method and device for arranging a wire shaped element in a given pattern between layers of material and strips or webs of material, respectively, particularly for use in the manufacture of electrically heated objects such as blankets and cushions in which the wire shaped element is a heating cable. The invention relates to a method of arranging a wire shaped element in a given pattern between layers of material and to a device for arranging a wire shaped element in a given pattern between strips of material. It is known to arrange a wire shaped element between layers of material by weaving or lacing, in particular, a heating cable in the manufacture of, for example, electric blankets. A disadvantage of this known method is that it is circuitous and cannot be automated or only with difficulty. The invention has for its object to obviate said disadvantages and provides to this end a method of the kind set forth in the preamble which is characterized in that glue and the wire shaped element in the given pattern are applied to a carrier layer, in that the carrier layer is provided on the bottom and top sides with an outer layer and in that the assembly is finished. The finishing operation may consist, for example, of highfrequency sealing or gluing. According to a further aspect the method embodying the invention is characterized in that the finishing operation includes sewing. The advantage of sewing is that there is a free choice of the material of the outer layers and also of the thickness of the carrier layer and of any coating to be applied thereto the firstmentioned layers may consist of cloth and the last mentioned layers may be foam layers, which determine the performance of the blanket. For the same, above mentioned object the invention furthermore provides a device of the kind set forth in the preamble which is characterized in that it comprises a first supporting member for holding in an unwindable manner a first roll of strip material, a transport member for winding off and transporting the strip of material from the first roll in a given direction, at least one gluing member for apply ing glue to a surface of the transported first strip of material facing said gluing member and or the wire shaped element an element applying, member for applying the wire shaped element in a given pattern to a stirface of the transported first strip of material facing said element applying member, the at least one gluing member and the element applying member being arranged on the same side of the first strip of material, a second supporting member for holding in an unwindable manner a second roll of strip shaped material and for guiding the strip of material of the second roll onto the first strip of material provided with glue and the wire shaped element and a winding up member for winding up the strip of material thus composed on a third roll. The above described device provides a semi product, i.e.a roll of composite, strip shtaped material consisting of a first strip of material having glued to it a wire like element in a given pattern, the pattern being repeated in a direction of length on the first strip of material and being sandwiched between the first and the second strip of material.If desired, this composite semi product may be wound up or cut to length and delivered. For a further processing of the semi product the device embodying the invention is characterized in that it furthermore comprises a third supporting member for h olding in an unwindable manner a fourth roll of strip shaped material, a second transport member for winding off and transporting the strip shaped material of the fourth roll in a given direction and a fourth supporting member for holding in an unwindable manner the third roll of composite material and for guiding the third composite strip of material onto the fourth. strip of material, after which the strip of material thus composed together with a fifth strip of material wound off on the former is fed to a finishing machine. Preferably the finishing machine is a multi needle sewing machine for the same reasons as mentioned above. In order to prevent the needles from coming into contact with the wire pattern, the multineedle sewing machine can be controlled by reading signs or marks correspondine to the wire pattern. Preferably the signs are applied by the applying member to the first strip of material when the wire like element is applied. The invention thus permits of automating the production process, whilst there is a freedom in choosing the materials and variation thereof and thus freedom in determining the performance and appearance of the final products. At the same time the wire like element is protected against damage during the sewing operation. The invention will now be described more fully with reference to an embodiment shown in the drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows a first part of the device embodying the invention for producing the above mentioned semi product and Fig. 2 shows a further part of the device embodying the invention for producing a final product or a further semi product. The following description of the invention is directed to the manufacture of electric blankets, though in principle the invention is not limited thereto and can, in general, be applied for arranging a wire like element in a given pattern between layers of material.In the case of an electric blanket the wire like element is a heating cable. In accordance with the invention the heating cable is glued in a given pattern, in particular a loop shaped pattern to a first layer of material. This can be performed in various ways for example the glue can first be applied to a carrier layer, after which the heating cable is arranged thereon in the loop shaped pattern. Of course, several heating cables may be provided. Alternatively the heating cable may be first arranged in place after which the glue is applied, or the heating cable and the glue may be applied simultaneously or a heating cable already provided with glue may be applied to the carrier layer which may have been selectively provided with glue. A coating layer can then be applied to and pressed together with the carrier layer provided with glue and the heating cable.The glue may be applied selectively, for example it may be sprayed in the pattern of the heating cable, after which the heating cable is applied to the glue pattern.All these operations can be manually performed. The resultant semi product with the composite layer of material and the heating cable arranged in the desired pattern can then be finished by applying an outer layer to the bottom and top sides, which layer can be Qigh frequency sealed as far as the material allows or the layers may be needled, glued or sewn. Sewing is preferred because then all materials to be used can be freely chosen i.e. the thickness of the carrier and coating layers, which may be made from foam and the material of the outer layers. This may also be manually performed. It is noted that all layers of material can have the dimensions corresponding with those of an electric blanket or the semi product with the finished outer layers can be separated from a strip or web of material. Preferably the operations are performed mechanically, in particular fully automatically. This can be achieved by means of the embodiments of the invention shown in Figs. 1 and 2. For convenience the part of the device embodying the inventio shown in Fig. 1 is termed the wire applying machine and the part of the device embodying the invention shown in Fig. 2 the feeding and multi needle sewing machine. Referring to Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 designates the main frame of the wire applying machine and reference numeral 2 designates a conveyor belt passing around the rollers 21 and 22, the drive not being shown in the drawing. Reference numeral 23 designates a supporting member holding in an unwindable manner a first roll 12 of strip shaped material. The roll 12 is supported by the supporting member 23 in a manner such that the transport member, in this case the conveyor belt 2 can wind off the strip shaped material from the roll 12 and convey it in the direction indicated by the arrows A.Reference numeral 3 designates places of a hot melt spraying device controlled by the position of the hot melt spraying device relative to the driving mechanism 4 in order to apply a suitable glue pattern to the strip of material of the first roll. After the gluing device is arranged in the transport direction a numerically controlled mechanism for applying the wire in the X and Y directions. This mechanism Xs termed the element or wire applying member hereinafter. The wire applying member 5 is provided with a wire depositing mechanism including, as the case may be, a hot melt device for the heating cable, the windingoff being numerically controlled. The heating cable is designated by reference numeral 24. Reference numeral 25 designates a second supporting member for holding in an unwindable manner a second roll 13 of strip shaped material. There are furthermore provided a winding
