# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE FIBER ORIENTATION OF PAPERS

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for measuring the fiber orientation of papers 14 that include throwing the infrared light to papers of a cutting out test from paper products or a moving sheet on a paper machine, wherein the infrared light being transmitted through or reflected by papers, is mea sured to detect the degree of attenuation caused by the absorption effects of the papers 14 . The measurement is made with polarized infrared light and the direction of polarization is changed. The detection signals are processed so as to indicate the fiber orientation as a plot in polar coordinates. Alternatively, the polarization may be first made before throwing the infrared light at a paper sample, linearly polarizing it and changing the direction of polarization. The plot indicated on polar coordinates takes the form of an ellipsoid having its major axis coinciding with the axis of the main orientation of the fibers.
