# Improved apparatus for the collection of payments for commodities.

## Abstract
Apparatus for use in the collection of payments for com modities such as electricity, gas and the like the apparatus utilises signals from units from a KWH meter or meters, from coins and from a timing device to present information indic ative of credit remaining and average weekly and daily cost. Metering means 3a, 3b receives a signal indicative of the amount of commodity used, crediting means 4a, 4b receives a signal indicative of the credit for the commodity entered by the user and control means 1 controls the operation of the metering means and crediting means. The control means includes storage means 7 for storing signals cumulatively and calculates a daily and weekly average of commodity con sumption. The control means also calculates and indicates the value of credit at predetermined intervals.

## Description
IMPROVED APPARATUS FOR THE COLLECTION OF PAYNENZS FOR COMMODITIESDESCRIPTION The present invention relates to apparatus for use in the collection of payments for commodities such as electricity, gas, other fuels which require a coin or equivalent money token to be inserted to obtain credit for the use of such commodities. It is particularly but not exclusively envisaged that electricity is the commodity, although any other suitable commodity may be substituted therefor, subject to the criteria that the commodity is passed through a measuring instrument to a signal corresponding to some unit of measurement is displayed. There are known types of electricity prepayment meters which use signals from, units from a KWH meter and from coins and electricity coin collecting devices which use signals from coins and from a timing device. The present device uses signals from units from a KWH meter or meters, from coins and from a timing device. With those existing types of devices it is difficult for the consumer to assess his average weekly consumption of electricity and therefore to economise. In addition the display is in units of electricity and not costs and in order to calculate average cost numerous readings must be taken at regular intervals and the readings converted into money equivalents. Accordingly, it is considered that such features are disadvantages of known prepayment devices. According to the present. invention there is provided apparatus for the collection of payments for commodities comprising, metering means for receiving a signal indicative of the amount of commodity used, crediting means for receiving a signal indicative of credit for the commodity entered by the user, contr√≤l means for controlling the operation of said metering means and said crediting means, said control means including storage means for storing signals cumulatively, said control means calculating a daily and a weekly average of commddity consumption, and calculating and indicating the value of credit at predetermined time intervals. Preferably said control means is a microprocessor. Preferably also said storage means is a randomaccess memory RAM . It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the abovesaid disadvantages. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the apparatus according to the present invention and Fig. 2 is a flow chart of a programme for use with the block diagram of Fig. 1. The principal circuit element in Fig. 1 is a microprocessor MP 1 which is connected via a wripheral interface input output I O chip 2 to meters 3a, 3b, to coin or money devices 4a, 4b and to an on off switch 5. The microprocessor 1 is also connected to a programmable read only memory PROM 6 , a random access memory RAM 7 and a power supply 8. The power supply 8 includes a battery back up for the non volatile RAM 7.Alternatively the PROM 6 and the RAM 7 may be contained in the MP 1. The microprocessor output is connected via a common bus 9 to a credit meter and display 10 a weekly average meter and display 11 a fixed charge setting device, a link box tariff code 12 and a link box mode of operation 13. In use, signals are received by the MP 1 from meters , 3b which are used to measure the electricity and which give output signals corresponding to one unit consumed. These output signals are stored cumulatively under the control of the MP 1 in the RAM 7 to provide a day s 24 hours total. At the end of a day the cost of the units consumed is calculated and an average value is then calculated and displayed on the meter and display 10. During the day at suitable time intervals, say one hour, a proportion of the weekly average equivalant to the time unit is deducted from the credit displayed on the meter and display 10. The value of credit displayed is due to signals from either a coin from a coin chute 4a, a signal equivalent to a sum of money from a token coin chute 4b or a device for reading prerecorded credit cards not shown in the interest of clarity . When the value of credit displayed on the meter 10 goes negative the power supply is switched off by the MP 1 via the I O chip 2. Provision is, however, made to allow this value of credit displayed to go negative by a fixed amount. This negative reading must be cancelled by the provision of coins, or other money equivalent, before the power supply is restored. The feature prevents the customer feeding the meter for a period of time during a day and not taking supply at other times. A means of setting a weekly fixed charge to cover things like arrears, hire purchase or other payment and a proportion of this is taken from the credit displayed on the meter 10 at each time interval during the day. In this example, provision is made to operate on signals from two meters, although any number of meters is theoretically possible, merely requiring extension of the circuitry and memory capacity. The device also has provision for a plug in link box 12 in the form of a dual in line package, which provides the codes to identify the tariffs appropriate to the meters in use. The constants appropriate to these tariffs are read in from a hand held device via a jack plug 14 and are entered on setting up and also when tariffs are changed. Provision is made to preset the mode of operation for utilising a second plug in link box 13, the links in this box 13 corresponding to the mode described above, a prepayment meter mode and a variable charge collection mode. The programme sequences used to operate in these modes are displayed in flow chart form in Fig. 2. Advantages of the proposed apparatus are numerous and are listed as follows Three modes of operation can be incorporated in a single unit by utilising a preset plug in link box a the mode in which the customer puts in money to keep the supply available is based on the average weekly consumption over the previous seven days, this weekly consumption being displayed. The customers can therefore use this information to economi se or otherwise on their consumption b it can operate like a normal prepayment meter in which the units are charged as they are consumed, the display of the weekly average being available to the customer as above c it can operate like the previous variable charge collection which enables electricity to be available on a time cost basis.This form of operation depends on an assessment of the annual consumption converted into a weekly rate which is preset on the face of the device. In this mode it operates on an annual budgeting device and the weekly average is displayed for the customer s use. In the three above cases the input from one, two or more meters at different tariff rates can be accommodated. The device can also be arranged to accept signals from a coin chute as in present prepayment devices, a token chute where tokens replace coins, and a credit card device where the credit card device accepts prerecorded credit cards and provides a signal appropriate to the sum of money recorded. A fixed negative bias is provided which can be used to resolve feeding problems in the variable charge collection mode and the collection of fixed charges when the customer is away in modes a and b . A variable weekly charge can be set to cover things like hire purchase repayment, arrears, etc.
