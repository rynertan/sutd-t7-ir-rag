# Electrophotographic element.

## Abstract
A layered electrophotographic element comprises an electroconductive support bearing a charge generated layer having a charge transport layer superimposed thereon in which the charge generating layer comprises a disazo pig ment as charge generating agent dispersed in a binder com prising a mixture of a polyvinyl butyral and an acrylic resin, the disazo resin having the formula The charge generating layer is formed upon the electro conductive substrate by coating the substrate with a disper sion comprising a disazo pigment of formula I , a mixture of a polyvinyl butyral and an acrylic resin, and a volatile organic solvent, and allowing the dispersion to dry, by evaporation of volatile organic solvent.
