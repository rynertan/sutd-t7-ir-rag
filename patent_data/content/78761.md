# CONTAINER HAVING A PRESSURE RUPTURABLE SEAL FOR DISPENSING CONTENTS

## Abstract
The invention concerns a sealed container compris ing two layers of thermoplastic film heat sealed togeth er, a vee shaped area being formed as part of the heat seal pattern, with the apex of the vee 15 directed to ward the interior of the container. When pressure is applied to the container, such as by squeezing it, the heatseal ruptures, beginning at the apex of the vee 15 , and continuing through the heatseal in a well defined path. As a result, the contents of the container, such as an individual serving of ketchup, can be dispensed from the container in a controlled manner.
