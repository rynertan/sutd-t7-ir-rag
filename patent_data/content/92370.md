# A.C. motor controller.

## Abstract
An energy conserving motor controller for starting and operating A.C. induction motors at high efficiency. This invention provides a power controller for an A.C. induction motor 4 comprising switching means 1, 2, 3 which control the alternating currents supplied to the motor 4 , and control means 5 which control the non conduction angle of the motor 4 according to control voltages from either the efficiency monitors 6 or soft start control 7 . The efficiency monitor 6 monitors the voltage generated by the motor 4 during the non conduction of the switching means 1, 2, 3 . If that voltage is less than a reference, the non conduction angle is reduced whereas if the voltage is greater than the reference, the non conduction angle is increased. For motors operating at less than full load efficiency, the voltage and consequently the iron losses are reduced. The soft start control 7 causes the initial non conduction angle to equal a present angle, and decrease slowly to zero thereby reducing the start voltage and hence start current and torque supplied to the motor 4 .

## Description
A.C. MOTOR CONTROLLERThe present invention relates to the reduction of Iron losses and magnetising current of A.C. Induction motors operating with reduced load and efficiency.Previous systems for improving A.C. Induction motor efficiency have been dependent on the stator impedance and or power factor. Such systems have required accuracy in setting up for each motor and have also suffered from slow response times. Systems responsive only to stator power factor, if presented with a sudden increase in motor load, may be forced into a stall condition due to the dual polarity of the slope of the curve of power factor against rotor speed.According to the present invention there is provided a power controller for an A.C. induction motor, comprising switching means which control alternating current supplied to the motor control means which control the non conduction angle of the switching means monitor means which monitor the voltage generated by the motor during the non conduction of the switching means comparator means which compare the generated voltage with a reference voltage control means which change the non conduction angle of the switching means according to the output of the comparator means in a manner to maintain the generated voltage substantially equal to the reference and power factor monitoring and comparator means which act to override the voltage control means in a manner to reduce the non conduction angle when the monitored power factor exceeds the reference.This invention provides electronic apparatus for controlling the voltage applied to A.C. induction motors in a manner to reduce energy wastage by lightly loaded induction motors.Preferably, the switching means is in the form of a plurality of triacs, polarity opposed parallel connected silicon controlled rectifiers or other solid state switches, connected in series with the applied line voltage or in series with the motor stator windings.The switches are controlled in a manner which both minimises the effect on output voltage by variations in load power factor and minimises the voltage generated by the motors during the switch non conduction state. The minimum generated voltage during switch non conduction equals zero or a preset reference voltage.A major advantage of the present invention is that the parameter monitored and used to determine motor loading is essentially independent of individual motor charac teristics removing the necessity to tune the controller to the motor, or add mechanical sensing means to the motor.Particular embodiments of the invention are suitable for use in Variable Voltage Variable Frequency applications either as a controller between the variable voltage frequency source or by incorporating the algorithm here described in the voltage control stage variable voltage variable frequency source.A preferred embodiment of the invention monitors the voltage generated across the stator windings during the non conduction of the A.C. switching means and compares this voltage with a constant reference, such reference being the neutral or star point voltage in the case of a three phase motor, such embodiment including a power factor derived override circuit to ensure full voltage at full load.EmbodIments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of part of a controller for a three phase motor Figure 2 is a block diagram of the voltage monitor and compare means as applied to one phase Figure 3 illustrates the circuitry which controls the non conduction angle of the A.C. switches as applied to one phase incorporating the pover factor overrider for full voltage control Figure 4 illustrates the power factor detector circuit as used in each phase and Figure 5 illustrates the soft start soft stop circuitry.A first embodiment of the invention comprises a switching means in each phase or in sufficient phases to provide complete control of the alternating current supplied to the load. Each switching means is controiled by trigger signals such that current conduction ceases at cessation of load current flow. Monitor means are provided whereby the magnitude of the voltage generated across the stator terminals is monitored and comparison means are provided for comparison of the voltage magnitude with a reference, such reference being equal to neutral for three phase systems. Further monitor means are provided whereby the polarities of the applied phase voltages and phase currents are monitored and power factor dependent pulses derived.The controller includes means for generating a time reference signal, representative of the time elapsed from the last voltage zero crossing, there being one such reference per controlled phase. The embodiment has control means for generating the trigger signals or the AC. switching means, such control means being responsive to the comparison between a control voltage and the time reference signals.The control reference voltage directly controls the non conduction angle of each A.C. switching means, such non conduction angle being independent of load power factor. These trigger signals are applied to the A.C.switching means at a delay angle from the current cessation for that switching means and the delay angle is proportional to the control reference voltage.The control voltage is common to all controlled phases, resulting in equal control on all phases maintaining applied voltage and load current balance.The control voltage is derived from the output of circuitry which monitors the generated voltage from the stator terminal and compares this voltage with a reference voltage, increasing or decreasing the control voltage in a manner to keep the minimum voltage equal to the reference voltage.The control voltage is overridden by a power factor compare circuit for monitored power factor better than a reference power factor.The embodiment can provide reduced voltage starting to reduce starting current and torque. The following description explains one application of the invention wherein the voltage controller controls the voltage from a three phase constant voltage constant frequency supply, such controlled voltage being applied to a three phase three wire alternating current induction motor with the non conduction angle being controlled in a manner to reduce the inefficiency of the motor.As depicted in Figure 1, three semiconductor A.C.switches comprising reverse parallel connected silicon controlled rectifiers 1, 2 and 3 are used to control the current in each phase of a three phase delta configured motor 4. The voltage control section 5 controls the non conduction angle of the A.C. switches l, 2 and 3 and thus controls the voltage applied to the motor. The voltage control section 5 is controlled by the soft start section 7 during starting causing the average voltage applied to the motor 4 by the A.C. switches 1, 2 and 3 to increase from a low value to full line voltage. Under dynamic operating conditions, the voltage control section 5 is controlled by the efficiency monitor section 6, which monitors the motor efficiency and signals the voltage controller 5 in a manner that causes the motor to operate at improved efficiency under reduced load conditions.As depicted in Figure 2 the op amps 8 and 9 monitor the input and output voltage waveforms wherein op amp 8 outputs a high voltage when the positive generated voltage crosses neutral potential and op amp 9 outputs a high voltage when the negative generated voltage crosses neutral potential. The high outputs from op amps 8 and 9 are coupled to the control voltage integrator op amp 12 via the diodes 10 and 11. The output voltage from the control integrator ramps slowly upwards increasing the non conduction angle until outputs appear via 10 and 11, or a power factor override signal is received. Waveform a shows the input phase voltage and a typical controlled output voltage is illustrated as waveform b . Waveforms c and d illustrate the output signals from the op amps 8 and 9.Conditions of excessive non conduction angle lead to a controlled voltage waveform as depicted in waveform e with a combined waveform f applied to the integrator resulting in a reduction in controlled voltage and consequential reduction in non conduction angle.As depicted in Figure 3, the power factor monitor 17 monitors the angle between current and voltgae zero crossings and outputs a pulse stream g with mark space ratio dependent on the monitored angle. The pulse stream is coupled to op amp 20 via an opto coupler 18, there being one such power factor monitor per control led phase. Op amp 20 functions to sum the power factor waveforms from all monitored phases and provide limited filtering, to output a partially filtered D.C. voltage This This voltage is further filtered by a low pass filter 21 and added to the output of the voltage monitor and soft start control by the buffer 23.A voltage zero crossing detector and ramp generator 19 monitors the applied phase voltage generating a ramp voltage waveform i synchronised in phase to the zero crossings and operating at a frequency double that of the applied frequency.The ramp voltage is applied to the comparator 24 where it is compared in magnitude to the control voltage to generate a firing control signal j .As depicted in Figure 4, the power factor monitor.comprises two operational amplifiers 25 and 26, and a diode full wave bridge 27. Operational amplifier 25 monitors the applied phase voltage and outputs a squarewave kl with polarity equal to the applied phase. The voltage across the sold state soft switches is monitored by comparator 26 outputting a square wave m in phase with the current flow. The two waveforms k and m are Exclusive OR d by the circuit using full wave bridge 27 and optical isolator 24. The output waveform from the optical isolator is shown as g . As depicted in Figure 5, the soft start circuit comprises a variable reference voltage source and an integrator 29. The voltage is adjusted by means of potentiometer 32 and buffered by operational amplifier 28. The diodes 34 and 35 provide a constant voltage above or below the reference with transistor 30 controlling the polarity of the offset voltage. The offset voltage is converted to a constant current by the potentiometer 33 and the magnitude of this current is controlled by the valve set by potentiometer 33. The magnitude and polarity of the current applied to the integrator 29 charges or discharges the capacitor 30 to provide the soft start or soft stop option. The soft start voltage is applied via a diode 31 to ensure that the effective offset to the control voltage is only applied during starting or stopping.The principles herein described are applicable to both single phase and multiphase control systems and may be applied to multiphase systems with or without the neutral connection.The principles herein described are applicable to variable voltage frequency invertors or alternators to control the voltage applied to the motors with varying frequency for the purpose of variable sped control.
