# Testing digital electronic circuits.

## Abstract
A large scale integrated circuit chip 10 includes a plurality of bistables 11 connected to combinational logic 12 . In a diagnostic mode, the bistables 11 are operated as a serial shift register, allowing test data to be shifted through the chip between diagnostic input and output pins LPlN,LP OUT . In a chip test mode, the serial shift register is split into a number of shift register portions 20 , each of which is connected between a separate pair of input and output pins 13,14,LPIN,LPOUT . This allows test data to be shifted through all the shift register portions in parallel so as to speed up testing of the chip.
