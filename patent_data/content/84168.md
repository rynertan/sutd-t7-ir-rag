DescrIption of the Preferred embodiment t erring to Figs. 1 to 3, reference number 1 generically indicates a frame for reciprocating feeder 3 which introduces the refuse materials into the furnace for incineration. Hopper 5 is one example of a refuse feeding system. However, any number of systems may be used, as for example, the feeder may be of the carriage type. when loading by means of hopper 5, a bucket, which withdraws refuse from a vehicle, ditch or the like can be used. Furnace 9 comprises a stationary front 1 .7 and is provided with a cylindrical chamber having its axis inclined downward for operation in parallel with the flow of the air and the combustion gases which pass through it, as indicated by arrow f . Furnace 9 is supported by znnu iar acks 9A which rdli on rollers of the frame, some of which may be driven. Reference number 10 designates the burner. Ash chamber 12, described in further detail below accepts the discharge of furnace 9.Combustion gases from chamber 12 pass via coupling 56 through the lower part of post combustion chamber 14. Chamber 14 is extended on top by coupling 16 which provides vertical direct draft towards stack 18 said raft bering controlled by a shutoff gate, described below.Post combustion chamber 14 communicates laterally at its upper part with outlet coupling 22 which debouches into the top of purification unit 24. Coupling 22 is provided at its bottom with an outlet for the removal of water and ash as well as a vacuum outlet 26 which provides a forced draft towards stack 18 via suction conduit 28, aspirator 30 and delivery coupling 32. Coupling 56 and 22 are tangential in order to impart a whirllng motion to the gases in the chamber 14. Furnace front 7 see Figs. 4 and 5 forms a sealing labyrinth with the front upper ends of the furnace 9 hopper 36 being provided for the collection of material which may enter into the lower part of said labyrinth. At its center front 7 is provided with loading mouth 38, shaped in the manner which can be clearly noted from Fig. 5. The longitudinal profile of said loading mouth 38, which increases gradually from hopper 5 towards the furnace 9 is shown in Fig. G, Feeder 3 is provided with pusher 40 which is driven alternately in both directions aI indicated by double ended arrow f40. The front active part of pusher e0, which penetrates into mouth 38 has an appendage 42 which protrudes towards furnace 9 and facilitates the removal oj any material which may have compacted in hopper 5 and or mouth 38. On the side of furnace 9,opcosice front 7, is ioc ted discharge collector 44.The diameter of collector 44 is smaller than the diameter of the furnace so as to allow penetration of the collector into ash chamber 12. The inside step of discharge collector 44 see particularly Figs. 6, 7 and 8 is shaped so as to assure the cyclic removal of slag and ash from the lower part of the furnace to the narrower part of the collector. This shape is defined by front circular segment surfaces 46A, by approximately tangential blade surfaces 46B and by approximately helicoidal surfaces 46C. This arrangement, in combination with the axis of the furnace being inclined and the direction of rotation of the cylindrical furnace being that indicated by the arrows f9, results in a temporary stoppage of the material between the end part of furnace 9 and coupling 44. This temporary stoppage allows for the complete combustion of the refuse before removal of the slag and ash, by surfaces t ób, to ash chamber 12 via the axial passage of collector 44. In Figs. 9, 10 and 11 ash chamber 12 is shown in greater detail. It comprises an upper portion 51 with first apperture 53 to receive collector 44 and with second apperture 55 for the departure of the fumes towards chamber 14 through coupling 56. Upper portion 51 of ash chamber 12 is structured as a hopper for discharge of refuse towards the lower or collecting portion 57 of said chamber. Lower portion 57 is provided with side opening 59 for the removal of the ash. The size of upper and lower portion of passage 61 is controlled by gate 63 which is slideable between an open position and a closed position in which it intercepts said passage 61.Gate 63 see also Fig. 12 is slideable in seat 65 to reach a normal open position in which passage 61 is free and the ash, slag and solid residues can easily fall into the collecting portion 57 to be periodically removed. Gate 63 can be pushed in the direction of arrow f63 until seated so as to fully close passage 61 thereby assuring draft through the combustion furnace rather than through opening 59 when the door of the latter must be opened for the removal of ash, slag and unburned solid residues. During the periods of closure of passage 61 by gate 63, the rotation of furnace 9 is stopped by means of an electric limit switch which is actuated when the door to side opening 59 is opened. Stopping the rotation of furnace 9 when gate 63 is in its closed position, prevents the discharge of ashes and solid residues from the furnace through the collector 44 into the ash chamber 12, thereby avoiding the depositing on the close gate 63 of ash and solid residues which could interfere with the opening of the gate. The rotation o furnace 9 is resumed as soon as gate 63 is opened again. The stopping and starting of the rotation of furnace 9 can be controlled by the movements of the gate, or there can be provided suitable devices for the timed sequence of such maneuvers.Suitable linkages or devices nay be provided as to prevent opening the door of opening 59 when the gate 63 is in its open position.It Gate 63 can be made in the form of a heat resistant box 63A which defines the upper surface of gate 63 since the coibus.íon in furnace 9, chamber 12, and post combustion chamber 1 A continues regardless of the position of the gate, thereby exposing said gate to continuous high temperature combustion gases. Slide guides located in seat 65 for gate 63 advantangeously have discharge chutes 65A for the removal of ash deposits from the guides, which if not removed would clog the ends c the cuides and thereby prevent complete closing of gate 63.The maneuvering of gate 63 is effected by handle member 66 which may be pivotally connected to gate 63. Figs. 13, 14 and 15 depict purification unit 24 which is in substance a smoke wash tower unit. Purification unit 24 is provided with upper connector 22 for the introduction of the fumes from the post combustion chamber. Purification unit 24 is also provided with outlet 26 for the introduction of Åa forced draft. In practice, the smoke flows downward in parallel flow with a shower of water coming from spray group 70. A ring or similar filter, the components of which are contained in a cage like basket, is provided in two sections 72 which are substantially symmetrical with respect to a diameter and can be removed laterally from mouth 74 and turned over to faciliate the cleaning thereof they being reinserted in reverse position after a certain period of use.Below the basket of the filter there is a substantially conical wall 76 for centrifuging the drops of water. Conical wall 76 serves to convey the smoke and aqueous particles towards an annular peretral passage which is provided with fins 78. This passage in comMination with fins 78 is adapted to impose an eddying movement to the smoke and liquid particles containing the solid parts to be separated from the smoke. The liquid is collected in bottom 80 of the wash tower and passed through conduits 82 into settling tanks 84 or other recovery system.The gases, however, proceed in the direction indicated by arrows f86 and pass through a central conduit 86 which has its inlet opening below cone 76. The eit end of conduit 86 extends below bottom SO. From conduit 86 the smoke is introduced into conduit 28 of the forced draft via outlet 26. Figs. 16, 17 and 18 depict the post combustion chamber 14 with overlying connector 16 leading to stack 18. In these figures, it can be seen that connection 56, as well as outlet connection 22, are tangential so as to obtain an eddying movement of the smoke during its passage through the post combustion chamber. At its upper end, chamber 14 terminates in passage 16a towards connector 16 the latter being provided with a draft metering gate having two symmetrical sections 90. Sections 90 are adapted to slide symmetrically in their plane so as to close and open the direct draft passage 16A from the pos. combustion chamber 14 to stack 18. Gate sections 90, which are suitably protected with heat resistant material, are closed when the smoke is to be drawn into purification unit 24. Alternatively, these gates are open for direct draft when purification of the smoke is not necessary or when it is necessary to intervene temporarily for maintenance or the like in the purification unit. Connection 16 may also be provided with an attachment 163 for possible use in connection with an auxiliary burner, while above or in said connection outlet 32 of the forced draft can be located. It will be understood that the drawings show only one example given merely as a practical demonstration of the invention and it may be varied in its forms and arrangements without going beyond the scope of the concept which forms the basis of the invention.
