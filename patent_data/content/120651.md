## Description
Stretching Sheet Materials This invention relates to apparatus for Use in stretching sheet materials and it has particular, though not exclusive, application in stretching fabric or woven screens, sometimes known as silk screens, for use in printing. It will be appreciated that such screens may be fabricated or woven from a variety of materials, including stainless steel and plastics materials. The preferred embodiment of the invention to be described enables a screen to be stretched exceptionally uniformly and to be maintained in the stretched condition in a comparatively simple way. Purthermore, with this embodiment, it is possible to position a screen and a stencil relative to one another comparatively easily, the positioning step being carried out at one location, and the screen with the stencil thereon being transferred to and arranged at a second location at which the printing step is carried out. Arrangements for stretching silk screens have previously been described. For example, in U.K. PatentSpecification No. 711,269, there is described an arrangement in which a screen is stretched by pushing or pulling the screen at or near to its edges into a channel or groove. However, th arrangements described in that specification do not provide any simple means for ensuring that the screen is stretched along its length by an amount different from that by which it is stretched across its width. In the embodiments of the present invention to be described, means are provided 5 icll enable more uniform stretching of a screen to be obtained in a comparatively simple way. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the main parts of a frame assembly separated from one another Fig. 2 is a plan view from beneath of the parts shown in Fig. 1 assembled together Fig. 3 is a side view of the assembly as shown inFig. 1 Fig. 4 is an end view of the assembly with the parts assembled Fig. 5 is a section on the line A A of Fig. 2 in the direction of the associated arrows Fig. 6 is a section on the line B E of Fig. 2 in the direction of the associated arrows Fig. 7 is a section on the line C C of Fig. 2 in the direction of the associated arrows and Fig. 8 is a section through a partofanoiter anangent. Referring now to the drawings, there is shown a rectangular main frame 1 having longitudinally extending side members 2 and 3 and side members 4 and 5 defining the width of the frame. The members 2 and 3 are longer than the members 4 and 5 and at each of their ends there is an adjustable leg 6 having a foot 7. The legs 6are arra d to space the assembly from a bed or platform on which it is placed by a given predetermined amount. The outer edges of the side members 2, 3, 4 and 5 have flange portions extending therefrom as best seen inFigs. 5 7 where flanges 8 and 9 extend from members 2 and 5 respectively. The widths of the lower faces 11 and 12 of the side members 2 and 3 are of both. the same dimensions.The widths of the lower faces 13 and 14 of the side members 4 and 5 are both of the same dimensions. The widths of the faces 11 and 12 are greater than the widths of tile faces 13 and 14, for reasons which will be explained below. Clamping members 15 18 having a U shaped cross section are held in position on the flange portions extending from the side members 2, 3, 4 and 5, by means of butterfly headed screws 19 and knurled headed screws 20. There is no significance in the use of the different types of screws 19 and 20. The particular embodiment shown is a prototype which employs and illustrates the basic features of the invention. There are a number of different features of design that would be incorporated in a final embodiment. A mesh screen 22 is shown in Fig. 1 extending over the main frame 1 and around the flanges projecting from the outer edges of the sides 2 5, as may best be seen from Figs. 5 7. The screen 22 is held in position by the clamping members 15 18 which are clamped on to the flange portions, e.g. 8 and 9, extending from the outer edges of the side members2 5 by the screws 19 and 20. At this stage the screen 22 is held substantially in a plane against the faces 11 14 Fig.2 ,as indicated by the solid lines in Figs. 3 and 4. The major portion of the screen 22 is next displaced from the plane indicated by the solid lines inFigs. 3 and 4 to a second plane indicated by chain dotted lines in Figs. 3 and 4, by means of a stretching frame 23. The length of the stretching frame 23 is defined by longitudinally extending side members 24 and 25 and its width is defined by side members 26 and 27. The side members 24 27 have downwardly extending portions 28 31 whose outer faces fit snugly against the inner faces of the side members 2 5 of the main frame 1, and flange portions 32 35 which overlap the upper faces of the side members 2 5.Countersunk headed screws 36 pass through holes 37 40 in the flange portions 32 and 33 and engage threaded holes 41 44 En the sides 2 and 3 of the main frame 1 The lower outer corner edges of the downwardly extending portions 28 and 29 are bevelled to a greater degree towards their ends, as indicated at 46 and 47 on portion 29 and in Figs. 1 and 3, than they are at their centres. The lower outer corner edges of the downwardly extending portions 30 and 31 are bevelled uniformly along their length, as indicated at 48 in Figs. 1 and 3. The variation in the bevel on the lower outer corner edges 29 of the portion of the member 25 may be clearly seen in the differences between the crosssectional views shown in Figs. 5 and 6, where the screen 22 passes around the edges. In use, the screen 22 is first attached to the frame 3 by locating it around the flange, for example flange 8, projecting from one of the longitudinally extending members and clamping it in position by means of theU shaped memluer 15 and the screws 19. The screen is then stretched by hand, as uniformly as possible, and located around the flange extending from the other longitudinally extending member 3, where it is clamped in position by the member 16 and the screws 19. A similar operation is then carried out to stretch the screen 22 along its length from the position in which it is located around the flange portion 9 on member 5 and held in position by the clamping member 18 and the screws 20 to the position in which it is located by the clamping member 17 around the corresponding flange extending from the member 4.At this stage the screen 22 is held in a plane against the faces 11 14,as shown by the solid line in Fig. 3. The stretching frame 23 is then lowered into position so that the lower edges of the downwardly extending portions 26 29 of the members 24 27 rest on the screen 22.The frame 23 is then drawn down in an even manner to press upon the screen 22 by screwing the screws 36 into the holes 4i 4Li in the sides 2 and 3 of the main frame 1. By this means the stretching frame 23 is drÅawn down into the main frame 1 until the flange portions 32 35 rest on the side members 2 5 and the major portion of the screen 22 is displaced to the plane indicated by the chain dotted lines in Fig. 3. It will be noted that the plane defined by the chain dotted lines 22 is arranged such that a smal gap exists between it and a base 22a upon which the feet 7 rest. A stencil not shown to be used in the printing process is placed on the base 22a upon which the feet 7 rest and the frame assembly 1, 23 can easily be positioned accurately with respect to the stencil so that the screen 22 is a little above the stencil. When the stencil and screen 22 are in the correct registration, the screen 22 may be pressed down on to the stencil.The screen will pick up the stencil and the assembly complete with the stencil can be moved to a further location at which the printing step may be carried out.At the further location, the distance between the screen 22 and the material to be printed may be suitably adjusted, for example by adjusting the lengths of the legs 6. In order to provide a more uniformly stretched screen 22, the dimensions of the main frame 1 and the stretching frame 23 are carefully determined. It will be noted that the screen 22 is rectangular in shape and, unless a different degree of stretching is applied to the width of the screen from that applied to its length, the stretching of the screen is not uniform. In some printing applications, the lack of such evenness of stretching may not be of great importance, however in others it is of great importance in order to enable accurate registration to be obtained. In the particular embodiment described, it will be noted that the downwardly extending portions 28 31 of the members 24 27 are of equal depth and that they displace the screen 22 from the first to the second parallel planes, as indicated by the solid and chain dotted lines 22 in Fig. 3 in a uniform manner. The difference between the amount by which the screen 22 is stretched across its width and that by which it is stretched along its length is determined by the difference in the widths of the side members 2 and 3 and the side members 4 and 5 of the main frame 1. This difference is clearly visible in Fig. 2. This difference may also be appreciated by comparing Figs. 5 and 7 and noting the difference between the widths of the faces 11 and 14. Considering Figs. 5 and 7, a portion of the screen 22 forms in each case the hypoteneuse of a right angled triangle, and, in Fig. 7, the face 14. The other side of the triangle is in each case provided by the respective doBn5ardly extending members 29 and 31.The length of the side of the triangle provided by the respective members 29 and 31 is in each case the same since the lower edges of the members 29 and 31 of the stretching frame 27 have been moved downwardly from the level of the faces 11 and 14 defining the first planar position of the screen 22 to the position shown, by the same amount. The width of the screen 22 initially included the portions which were against the face 11 and the corresponding face 12 on the member 3.The insertion of the stretching frame 23 has caused the portions which were against the faces 11 and 12 to be moved so that they form the hypoteneuse of the above mentioned triangle and the portion between the sides of the frame 23 to be displaced directly doxmçards. It may thus be considered that the width of the screen 22 has been stretched by twice the difference between the width of the face 11 and the length of the above mentioned hypoteneuse of the triangle shown in Fig. 5. Similar considerations apply to the length of the screen 22.The length of the screen 22 may be considered to have been stretched by twice the difference between the width of the face 14 and the length of the hypoteneuse of the above mentioned triangle shown in Fig. 7. The use of the chamfered portions of the edges shown best at 46 and 47 in Fig. 3 have been found to be helpful in evening out tensions that might overwise occur in the corner regions of the screen 22. Chamfering or rounding of the edges, as shown at 48 is helpful in reducing stresses on the screen 22. It will be appreciated that the arrangement of the rounding or chamfering may be different from that shown and that variable degrees of chamfering may be given to the lower edges of the downwardly extending portions 30 and 31 of the members 26 and 27 in addition to or instead of that on the portions 28 and 29. The method of clamping of the screen by means of the members 15 18 and the screws 19 and 20 may be replaced in a production model by the use of bars having a surface that grips the screen material and that are held in position by toggle action clamps. It is also possible for one of the side members for example member 2, to be of the same depth as the downwardly extending portions 29 of the stretching frame 23 so that the action of stretching occurs as a result of the dis placement of the screen from its position against the lower face 12 of the side member 3 only. In determining the difference between the amount of stretch given to the screen in one direction compared to the amount of stretch given in the other direction, it may be necessary to take account of differences in tension between the longitudinally extending strands and the transversely extending strands of the woven fabric screen material. Thus, even with a square frame it may be necessary to employ a degree of differential stretching in order to even out the tension in the screen material. On the inside lower face of each of the clamping members 15 18, there may be provided a strip of resilient material having ridges and grooves along the length of its surface that mate with grooves and ridges in a similar strip of material on the underside of the flange portions, e.g. 8 and 9 extending from the outer edges of the side members 2 5. In this arrangement, when the screws 19 and 2n are thightened, the action of the clamping members 15 18 is not only to clamp the screen, but also to apply further tension to the screen as the screen material is forced into the mating grooves by the ridges of the strips of resilient material. In yet another embodiment, there is, attached to the inner face of the vertical wall of each of the clamping members 15 1S, a strip of resilient material having on its surface upwardly directed serrations or teeth that grip the screen material and draw the screen tighter across the frame as the screws 19 and 20 are tightened and the clamping members 15 18 are moved upwards relative to the side members 2 5. In one particular application of the embodiment described, it may be considered that three stages of operation are employed in setting up the apparatus. Firstly, there is the stage during which a screen 22 is stretched evenly and comparatively lightly, with the screen material held between the clamping members 15 1S and the sides 2 4 of the main frame 1. In the second stage, the stretching frame 23 is introduced into the main frame 1 and the screws 36 are tightened to bring the stretching frame down into the main frame 1 until the screen 22 is displaced into the second plane indicated by the chain dotted lines inFigs. 3 and 4. In this position the frame 23 and the screen 22 are on the bed or base 22a upon which the feet 7 rest. Assuming that the bed or base 22a is flat, it is possible by this means easily to bring the stretching frame 3 and the screen 22 down on to the bed or base 22a, and to arrange that the screen is in even contact with the bed or base alld therefore also flat. In the particular application being described, ill a third stage, the length of each of the legs 6 is then extended by an equal amount. In the particular prototype, the legs 6 are replaced by longer legs which, in effect, are gauges or spacers. These longer legs 6 space the stretched flat screen 22, in the plane indicated by the chain dotted lines in Figs. 3 and 4, from the base on which the feet 7 rest by a predetermined amount. The predetermined amount is sufficient to enable a stencil film or coating to be arranged beneath, and in a given position relative to, the screen 22. Pressure on top of the screen 22, for example by a roller, results in the screen 22 being brought down on to the stencil which is picked up by the screen in a well known way.It is alternatively possible to arrange that the screen 22 is moved down evenly on to the stencil by means of further downwards movement of the stretching frame 23, brought about by further tightening of the screws 36, in order to assist in picking up the stencil and then to release the screws 36 sufficiently to bring the screen 22 back up into or towards the plane indicated by the chain dotted lines in Figs. 3 and 4. The longer legs 6 employed in this third stage are such that the distance between the screen and the base which is beneath the screen during printing is not sufficient to allow the screen to be stretched beyond a predetermined limit during printing. The step of releasing the screws 36 after the stencil has been picked up has tlie effect of releasing the tension in the screen 22 slightly and thus the screen shrinks slightly and grips the stencil better in its interstices. It will be appreciated that other means than adjust able, hinged or replaceable legs 6 may be used to achieve the required spacings. For example, fixed studs of different predetermined lengths may be arranged upon the frame in such a way that, in any one stage of the process, only one set of the studs is operative. It is, of course, possible to arrange for the spacers or studs to be on the base or bed on which the frame 1 rests and not upon the frame itself, or for separate and different spacer members of predetermined depth to be brought into position from an adjacent position at the appropriate stages in the process. It will also be understood that, after a screen 22 has been stretched to a required even tension, a separate frame may be placed upon and glued to the screen 22. When the separate frame has become firmly attached to the screen 22, the screen may be cut away around the separate frame and a separate frame having a screen with a particularly even tension is thereby obtained in a simple manner. In this use of the invention in the production of separate frames, the actual arrangement shown in the accompanying drawings is not itself used in a printing process. It has been found that by adjusting independently individual ones of the screws 19 and 20 in the embodiment described, extremely accurate control of the tension in local areas of the screen 22 can be obtained. In attaching a separate frame to a screen that has already been stretched, it is necessary to place the separate frame on to the screen or cloth and, in order to ensure a good contact with the screen or cloth suitable for gluing, it may be necessary to press the frame on to the screen while the glue between them sets or cures. This pressing or pushing will change the tensions in the screen or cloth that is in a stretched condition. If however, the separate or manufactured frame is placed between the stretching frame and the surface of the screen or cloth, and provided that the correct dimensions are maintained, the screen can be stressed accurately to the particular separate frame in one operation.After the frame has been glued to the screen, the manufactured or sub frame can be cut away from the stretching frame assembly by cutting the screen around the separate frame in the way described above. A cross section through a part of an arrangement employing this method will now be described with reference to Fig. 8 of the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 8 there is shown one side 55 of a male tensioning frame with one box section side 56 of a previously manufactured separate frame arranged between the side 55 of the tensioning frame and a woven screen 57.A side 58 of the main female frame of toe assembly incorporates a spacer portion 59 and a flange 6o having a longitudinally serrated lower surface 61. The spacer portion 59 locates the side 56 of the separate frame and similar spacer members, each aranged on another side of the separate frame, maintain the differential stretching relationship previously described. A tensioning screw 62 is shown coupling the side 55 of the tensioning frame to the spacer portion 59. The serrated lower surface 61 of the flange 6o extends along the length of the flange by an amount corresponding at least to the length of the separate frame 56.Cooperating with the serrated surface 61 is a similarly serrated surface 63 of a member 64 forrning with the flange member 60 a pair of jaws. The jaw members60 and 64 are held together by a channel section member 65 which slides over them. In use the screen material 57 is arranged to extend between the jaw members 6o and 64 and it passes around one of the members. In Fig. 8 the material 57 is shown at 66 passing around the member 64 to extend at 67. The material 57 is first pulled as evenly as possible manually and then the jaws 60 and 64 are brought together and held in an interlocked position by the channel member 65. The jaw members grip the material 57 firmly between the serrated portions and provide an additional tensioning.The channel member 65 holds the jaw members together and grips the material 57 firmly. Further tensioning is carried out by means of the screws 62 ab described previously. The lower jaw 64 may be hinged to the upper jaw 6o on one side only, making sure that the serrations fully ealgage when the hinge is closed. Alternatively the upper jaws may be attached loosely to their respective lower jaws so that the cloth or fabric may freely slide bet eei them and so that any one side can be clamped independently of any or all of the other three. To clamp any side, the cloth is gently pulled to remove excess folds, wrinkles or creases and the jaws 60 and 61l are pressed together. The channel section 65 is then slipped or pushed over the twio closed jaws to lock them. l.hen a screen or cloth is placed between the jaws and they are pressed together the cloth is drawn into the jaws. If one end of the cloth offers resistance as a result of it having been clamped, the cloth continues to be drawn into the jaws until the frictional forces exerted by the jaws equalize the tensional forces on the cloth. To some extent, the forces required to deflect the cloth will play d part. Should there be a wrinlde, fold or crease in the cloth, no tensional forces will occur until the rinlele, fold or crease is removed.Further advantages of this particular arrangement are that tho cloth or fabric lays flat and is unencumbered by any protuberances. The only protuberances may be hinges on the jaws. The spacer portions 59 need not extend along the whole length of a side, they may be placed at points where it is necessafl to transfer the strain to the manufactured frame. It will be appreciated that this development concerns a different approach from the usual to the stretching of sheet materials and cloths. Woven cloths used in screen printing are usually plain or twill woven and are so made as to give an interlocking action to each thread making it impossible to pull a thread out of the main body of the cloth. Each thread acts upon others in its vicinity. Stresses in other sheet materials act in a similar mamner. The apparatus of the invention can stretch other sheet materials for example paper and sheet metals, and it can be used to prestress reinforcing materials. By increasing the number of tension screws in the arrangement described and by making the female main frame flexible, the tensions in any given part of the screen surface can be varied comparatively easily. It will be appreciated that, although the invention has been described, by way of example, with reference to particular embodiments, variations, modifications and combinations of the arrangements shown may be made. For example, the frame may be other than rectangular in shape and the ridges and grooves on the members 15 18 and on the jaw member 6o and 64 may be rounded at the peaks and in the troughs. It will also be understood that the terms cloth, fabric and screen are interchangeable in the context of this specification and that they may be made from any suitable material, including filament materials of plastics and metal, or that they may be sheet material which may be perforated or not. It will also be appreciated that material may be stretched in shapes other than rectangular, for example a frame may be shaped such that material is stretched over a circular or an oval area. It will also be appreciated that differences in tensioning may be obtained by varying the depths of the downwardly extending side portions 28, 29 and 30,31 of the frame 23 along their lengths andlor of varying the spacings between the corresponding side portions 28,29 and 30,31 of the frame 23 and the outer edges of the corresponding side members 2, 3 and 4,5 of the frame 1 along their lengths.
