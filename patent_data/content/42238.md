# Manufacture of hydrocracked low pour point lubricating oils.

## Abstract
Hydrocracked, low pour point lubricating oils of good stability are manufactured by passing a suitable hydrocarbon feed 1 and hydrogen 2 sequentially through a hydrocracking zone 4 , a catalytic dewaxing zone 9 , and a hydrotreating zone 11 , all at high pres sure and in that order, with purification of the hydrogen gas 6 prior to passage to the dewaxing zone. By main taining all zones at high pressure, the efficiency of the process is augmented.
