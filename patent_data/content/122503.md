## Description
The present invention relates to a system for determining attitude of a first object relative to a second object comprising first means on said first object for transmitting a beam of light, lines grating means on said second object disposed in the path of said beam of light for reflecting said beam of light as a diffracted fan of collimated light bundles back to said first means, said first means including sensor means having a face disposed in the path of said reflected bundles of light for determining pitch, yaw and roll based on the position of said light bundles falling on said face of said sensor means, and optical means for transmitting said beam of light and focussing said reflected bundles of light on said face of said sensor means. Precise information of relative attitude between remote objects is necessary for a variety of reasons. For instance, in a spacecraft it is often important to determine variances in attitude between the inertial reference platform and objects such as boom mounted, steerable antennas, remote sensor platforms and STS pallet mounted experiments to name a few. Such attitude information is necessary so that data received from or provided to such objects may be corrected or calibrated for relative deviation in attitudes between the inertial reference platform and the object of interest. Use of star trackers or gyros to obtain attitude information for individual objects is often prohibitive in cost as well as space and weight requirements. Thus, systems which measure attitude without the necessity that each object includes its own attitude sensing apparatus are highly desirable and, in fact, are in existence today. One such system retires two transmitter receiver assemblies mounted, for example on the inertial reference platform. One transmitter receiver measures pitch and yaw through autocollimation by reflecting a beam of monochromatic light from a mirror mounted on the remote platform whose attitude is to be measured. Sensors in the transmitter receiver provide information of the pitch and yaw. The second transmitter receiver is necessary to determine roll of the remote platform. A second system utilizes a single transmitter receiver. Pitch and yaw are obtained as above but roll is obtained through the use of an active source which must be mounted on the remote platform to direct a beam of polarized light back to the transmitter receiver. According to US patent 4,330,212 a further system had already become known with a single transmitter receiver in which a light beam is produced on a first platform and this laser beam is impinging onto a crossed mirrored Ronchi ruling being installed onto a second platform while the diffracted light bundles are reflected on a target on the first platform. With this system as well the pitch and yaw as the roll may be determined. A system as mentioned at the beginning of the description is known from US A 3 269 254. In this system pitch, yaw and roll of an object can be measured by visually determining the precision of image points of light bundles in a measuring reticle. It is the object of the present invention to provide a system as described above, which is improved over the prior art. The system according to the present invention is characterized in that a beam of monochromatic light is used, that said sensor means include a first charge transfer device area array disposed in the path of said reflected bundles of light for sensing the light intensity of at least the light bundle of zero order and at least one further charge transfer device area array separate from said first array for sensing the light intensity of at least one bundle of higher order, said at least two arrays each comprising a matrix of light collecting pixel elements arranged in a common x y coordinate system, and that a microprocessor is provided for determining the position of said zero order reflected light bundle relative to said coordinate system and the angle of a line connecting two extreme bundles of light falling on said sensor means with said coordinate system. The present invention relates to a three axes attitude transfer system for measuring pitch, yaw and roll of a remote object or platform relative to a reference platform. Preferably said reflected bundles of light form a line orthogonal to the lines of said line grating means. This system may be advantageously used when said first object is an inertial reference platform. It may also be of advantage when said sensor means includes means for determining the centroid of selected ones of said reflected bundles of light falling on said face of said sensor means. Preferably said line grating means comprises a ruled reflection grating of a Ronchi type fixed on said second object in the path of said monochromatic beam of light. In the following the invention should be further explained in more detail with reference to the drawings in which Figure 1 shows a transmitter receiver assembly 11. The transmitter receiver assembly 11, hereinafter referred to as transceiver 11, is normally mounted within an inertial reference platform of the type used in spacecraft for determining position and attitude in space. The remote platform whose attitude is to be measured has a ruled grating 12 of the Ronchi type fixed thereto. The remote platform is generally located some distance from the inertial reference platform. It may be within the spacecraft such as a remote sensor platform or outside the spacecraft such as an antenna controlled from the spacecraft by means of a boom. In any event the remote platform is subject to variations in pitch, yaw and roll relative to the inertial reference system due to racking, vibrations and the like to which the spacecraft may be subject. The transceiver 11 comprises means for transmitting a beam of monochromatic light to the grating 12 where it is diffracted and reflected back to the transceiver as a fan of light bundles or beams of varying intensities and orders. Wherein light bundles of different orders will be diffracted by the grating 12 in Fig. 1 according to the following formula In particular, the transceiver 11 comprises a laser source 13, a beamsplitter 14 and a pair of mirrors 15 and 16. The mirror 15 has a concave surface facing the convex surface of mirror 16. As can be seen in Figure 1 mirror 15 has a central opening with mirror 16 disposed with its optical axis coincident with that of mirror 15. The beamsplitter 14 is positioned relative to laser source 13 and mirrors 15 and 16 so that a laser beam from the laser source 13 reflects from beamsplitter 14 and mirrors 15 and 16 to be directed toward grating 12. The optics for transmitting the beam are conventional and their function may be carried out by other conventional optics such as a refractive lens system. The transceiver 11 further comprises a pair of identical charge transfer device area arrays 17 and 18 disposed in the same plane one above the other for receiving the fan of light bundles or beams reflected from line grating 12. The charge transfer device area arrays 17 and 18 are commercially available devices and are available, e.g. from the General Electric Company. Each of the arrays 17 and 18 may, e.g. comprise up to five hundred pixels per side. The array of pixels is partially shown in the upper left hand corner of CTD array 18 shown in Figure 2. Each pixel area is an individual light sensor and provides an output voltage representative of the intensity of the light incident thereon. As seen in Figure 1 the laser beam shown by solid lines is transmitted to line grating 12 of the remote platform. The zero order reflected beam returns to the transceiver and passes through the optics of mirrors 15 and 16 and beamsplitter 14 to be focused at point P₁ on CTD area array 17 as shown in Figure 2. Figure 1 also shows one of the diffracted orders of beams in dashed lines reflected by the line grating 12. This order is reflected at an angle ϑ, with respect to the optical axis so that it is directed back through the optics to focus as point P₂ on CTD area array 18 shown in Figure 2. Of course, the fan of light bundles reflected from line gratings are numerous some of which are shown as dark dots in Figure 2. The fan of light bundles are by definition orthogonal to the direction of lines on line grating 12. This relationship remains true even though the remote platform may deviate in pitch, yaw and roll relative to the inertial reference platform which contains the transceiver 11. Thus, the angle that the line of images of the light bundles makes with the Y axis of the CTD arrays 17 and 18 provides roll information. The position of the zero order image P₁ with respect to the center of CTD array provides pitch and yaw information to better than one arcsecond of accuracy. The two extreme reflected bundles of light P₁ and P₂ in Figure 2 provide sufficient information to obtain roll to less than one arcsecond of accuracy. Points P₁ and P₃ on CTD area array 17 are sufficient to give roll information to about 8 arcseconds permitting CTD area array 18 to be eliminated if roll accuracy of 8 arcseconds is adequate. Thus, accuracy in roll measurement is a function of the distance between CTD area arrays 17 and 18 with accuracy increasing as the distance therebetween is increased. In a practical embodiment each CTD area array is 1cm 0.4 inches square with the overall separation between the two arrays capable of being varied over a range of several inches. The CTD area arrays provide data inputs to a microprocessor, e.g., a Motorola MC 68000 which centroids all detected images to derive pitch and yaw information from the location of point P₁ and roll information from the angle between the line joining points P₁ and P₂ and the array coordinate system. As seen in Figure 3 each reflected bundle of light overlaps several pixel areas on the CTD area array 17 and 18. This permits use of a standard center of mass algorithm programmed into the microprocessor to determine the centroid of the returning bundle of light relative to the coordinate system of the CTD area arrays 17 and 18. As is well known, each pixel area of a CTD area array acts as a light collector. Thus, when the pixels of a CTD area array are turned on for its integration period which may last, e.g. a tenth of a second, photons of the light falling on a pixel area are converted to electrons and accumulated in each pixel in proportion to the local light intensity. After the integration period when all the pixels of a CTD area array are turned off the accumulated charge is automatically transferred out to the utilization device which in the present invention is microprocessor 19. Considering the 3 x 3 pixel matrix of Figure 3 it is seen that a bundle of light reflected from line grating 12 may be imaged at a random location on either CTD 17 or 18 and each image may overlap up to nine pixels M₁ M₉. By comparing the light collected in each of the pixels relative to the others, the centroid given by coordinates This calculation may be performed in a microprocessor by a single center of mass algorithm substituting the amount of light collected by each pixel and digitally encoded for mass. Thus, the algorithm where In particular to derive the relative pitch and yaw angles the microprocessor performs the following algorithm using point P₁ centroid coordinates where, F is the effective focal length of the transceiver optical system 15 and 16 measured in micrometer units. The location X₀, Y₀ is a data base item stored in the microprocessors memory along with other calibration data including the value of F. To obtain the relative roll angle the microprocessor implements the following algorithm where, The data collected by CTD area arrays is transferred to microprocessor 19 at the end of each integration period and may be updated at rates of up to 30 Hz. During the transfer process photoelectrons generated within each pixel during the previous integration period are transferred in bucket brigade fashion to an output pre amplifier 20 shown in Figure 4 on each CTD area array. Here each charge packet is amplified and is then filtered and encoded into one of 255 digital values 8 bit quantization via off chip electronic circuitry 21 . The digital values typically 9 from image P₁ and 9 from image P₂ are then passed to the microprocessor 19 for the computation of pitch, roll and yaw. Along with these digitised signals, the address of each sampled pixel two 9 bit words per pixel , one word denoting the X coordinate of the pixel and one word denoting the Y coordinate of the pixel are forwarded to the microprocessor. Time information in the form of a digital word provided by a clock circuit 22 completes the information needed for alignment computation. The present invention, of course, is not limited to spacecraft but may find use in other vehicles, e.g., aircraft, land vehicles and where the remote object or platform is located internally or externally to the vehicle.
