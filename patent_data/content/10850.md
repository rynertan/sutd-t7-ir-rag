# Liquid polyisocyanate compositions.

## Abstract
Liquid polyisocyanate compositions comprising A from 90 to 50 by weight of a reaction product of diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a polyoxyalkylene polyol having an average functionality of 2 3 comprising from 50 100 by weight of a polyoxypropylene diol or triol having a hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 750 to 3000 and from 0 50 by weight of a polyoxyethylene diol or triol having a hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 750 to 3000, said reaction product having an NCO content of from 8 to 26 by weight, and B from 10 to 50 by weight of a diphenylmethane diisocyanate composition containing from 30 to 65 by weight of diphenylmethane diisocyanate, the remainder being polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of func tionality greater than two together with by products formed in the manufacture of such polyisocyanates by phosgena tion. The compositions are useful in the manufacture of polyurethanes, especially cold cure flexible foams.
