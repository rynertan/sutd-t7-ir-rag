# Card data validity checker.

## Abstract
The combination of a receiver of T.V. radiation with a card reader to enable centrally disseminated lists of lost or stolen cards to be instantly compared with every card checked into the card reader. The idea is to utilize one of the frame lines which are normally outside the picture area for encoding identity numbers of cards reported lost. A detail description of how this can be realized is given. The effect of this invention is a decisive shortening of the interval between the loss of a card and the moment when instructions reach the large number of sales points. Equally improved would be the speed in eliminating card numbers from the stop list once they are recovered by their owners.

## Description
Cash and Data Validity CheckerThe present invention relates to improved means of distributing the identification numbers of cards reported lost or stolen from a central agency to the point of sale locations on a country wide scale.Banks and Credit Card companies are known to suffer considerable losses from fraudulently or improperly used cards. Because of the large number of cards which at any one time are reported lost or stolen it is not practicable to telephone the card numbers to the equally large number of sales points. Lists of invalid cards take a relatively long time to distribute those in illegal possession of cards have, therefore, ample time for obtaining goods or services illegally.This application describes a device for reducing this delay to a matter of a few minutes, and for providing means by which a sales person may instantly determine the validity of any credit card or pay token proffered.The device consists of three parts.Pirstly, an electromagnetic radiation detection and amplifying device suitable for receiving the radiations associated with the broadcasting of public service programmes, radio or television. The device ignores the bulk of the service transmission but selects, by well established methods, specially coded signals which after recognition by electronic circuit means announce that, immediately following at exactly specified time intervals, the suitably encoded identification numbers of cards are going to be received.Secondly, these last mentioned received sigmals which relate to card identification numbers are stored in an electronic or magnetic store.Thirdly, the stored numbers are compared with identification numbers of each card presented to the sales terminal.Number entry may be either manual or automatic, and if an exact likeness is found an audible and or visual alarm signal is generated to indicate that the card just being presented is invalid. In automatic terminals the intended transaction is inhibited. The automatic reading of cards may be carried out in a number of ways consistent with the type of card used, e.g. magnetic strip, punched hole, laser erased, solid statememory cards.A more detailed description of one embodiment of the invention using television transmissions will now be given with reference to figs. 1,2 3. Firstly Figure 1 A suitable television aerial is used to collect the radiated signals the latter are amplified and have their carrier frequency changed in circuit block 1 . Further amplification takes place in the intermediate frequency stage 2 . The signal is then rectified in stage 3 and part of the resultant output signal is passed through a filter stage 4 and then used as a feedback signal to control the gain of the intermediate amplifier 2 . The rectified signal derived from stage 3 is input to both a frame sync. separator 5 and a line sync. separator 6 .All the stages so far described are essentially the same as those used in any conventional television receiver.The frame pulse is used to reset an electronic counter stage 8 which then counts the line pulses until a certain number is reached when a signal is given out by the counter to inhibit the line sync pulses in gate 9 .During the preceding line pulse a signal is given out by the counter lasting for the period of one line and is an input to an AND gate 10 . The detector signal from 3 is also input to a level discriminator stage 7 which gives out a positive voltage if the signal is above 50 of the peak white signal, but if the signal level is below that percentage, the output will be zero volts.The output of stage 7 is also input to AND gate 10 . The resultant output of this arrangement is shown inFig. 2 and consists of a signal lasting for one T.V.line and occuring at a fixed line number corresponding to the maximum count of line counter 8 and repeated each frame. This signal is originally transmitted xn coded form and so constituted that it may easily be decoded and correctly interpreted even in the presence of electrical or electro magnetic noise. The first part of the coded signal is a pulse lasting longer than any other that occurs in the sequence the bit sync pulse .The remaining pulses occur at regular intervals with the pulse lengths having two values, the longer pulses representing a binary 1 and the shorter pulses representing a binary 0. These pulses are conveniently described in four sets.The first set consists of a fixed number of pulses representing in coded form the address of that part of the store into which the data is to be entered. The second set of pulses is exactly the same as the first set. The third set of pulses consists of a fixed number of pulses representing the identification number of a known invalid card or token. The fourth set of pulses is exactly the same as the third.Referring to Fig. 3, the pulses from gate 10 of fig. 2 are input to a monostable circuit 11 whose period is approximately 0.75 of the bit sync.pulse and the monostable period is triggered by the positive going part of the bit sync pulse. When the end of the monostable period is reached its output goes positive and together with the delayed input signal delayed by R and C are input to the END gate 12 . The resultant positive pulse sets a bistable 13 whose output is input, conjointly with the fig. 3 INPUT signal, to an WAND gate 14 .Its output is input to a monostable 15 which is triggered by the positive going edge and whose period is approxi mately0.75 of the period of the pulse representing a binary 1. 15 produces a negative going output pulse applied to AND gate 16 together with the input to 15 .The resultant output is a pulse corresponding to a trans The resultanet output is a pulse corresponding to a transmitted binary 1. These pulses are input to block 17 which is a shift register. The shifting of the register is done by the output of 14 during the negative going edge. The output of the shift regtister 17 is input to a second shift register 18 . When both shift registers are full, there are two equal sets of data the identification number stored in register 17 and two sets of data the address stored in register 18 .The Comparator 19 compares the two section of the data in 17 and if they are found to be identical gives an output signal applied to AND gate 21.Comparator 2 compares the two sections of the data in 18 and if they are found to be identical also gives an output signal applied to AND gate 21 . When the next bit sync pulse is detected the output of And gate 12 which is one of the inputs to And gate 21 is used to produce a short ENABEM pulse to store 23 enabling said store to accept the paralell data input bits and take them in storage at the address indicated by the paralell address input bits. If,however, a card is being read in the card reader 24 until the read operation is completed and the signals thus generated are as required re coded in unit 25 .Thereafter Gate 21 is enabled by unit 24 and both the data of store 23 and of decoder 25 are applied to AND gates 26 from which an output signal is obtained only if a 1 1 the corresponding data bits are equal. The store 23 contains a continually updated list of all the card numbers which at a given instant remain impeached. With the aid of the counter 32 all the available addresses of the store 25 are cycled through at a fast clockrate. During this scanning period, address instructions from shift register 18 are not accepted in multiplex circuit 22 but if required may be held in a buffer store not shown . If a card number agrees with one of the numbers held in store 23 the comparator produces an output which triggers bistable 3 which sets an alarm signal. Bistable 30 is reset when the card is removed from the reader.The bistable 13 is reset by each frame pulse.
