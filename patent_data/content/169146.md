# Monoclonal antibodies directed against the cellular receptor of human rhinovirus.

## Abstract
DNA fragments encoding all the structural and non structural proteins and untranslated RNA genome regions of humanrhinovirus type 14 have been molecularly cloned and their nucleotide sequence determined. The composition and sequence of the entire 7,212 nucleotide long genome RNA have been determined. Monoclonal antibodies have been produced which block the binding of virus to susceptible cells or which neutralize the infectivity of the virus.

## Description
HUA RMINOVIRUS RNA AND PROTEINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Human rhinoviruses HRV belong to the picornavirus family ana contain at least 115 antigenically distinct serotypes. The picornavirus family also includes poliovirus and hepatitis A virus. Rhinoviruses are the most important common cold viruses to be discovered. The name rhinovirus reflects the prominent nasal involvement seen in infections with these viruses. The number of antigenically distinct rhinoviruses is so large that a person can be infected with a different rhinovirus each year and still not experience all of the known types in a life time. HRV exist as a caps it structure 20 40 nm with cubic symmetry utilizing 60 identical subunits composed of four peptide chains. The virions are ether resistant and acid labile. HRV contains an infectious, single stranded genomic RNA approximately 7,200 bases in length. Upon entrance into a susceptible cell, the RNA is immediately translated into a 240,000 mw polyprotein using host cell translational machinery. This polyprotein is subsequently processed by both cellular and viral encoded proteases to yield the structural and non structural proteins needed for completion of the infectious cycle. Limited research has been performed an HRV because of the numerous serotypes involved and the poor growth and purification procedures for HRV used in the past. In addition, past procedures utilized in direct RNA and protein sequencing were very laborious and time consuming. However, recent technological advances in cloning and sequencing of nucleic acid has allowed molecular characterization of HRV. Using these techniques, the entire genomicRNA and corresponding amino acid sequence of a HRV could be determined. This information would define significant target areas of the virus i.e., proteolytic cleavage sites for which specific antiviral agents could be developed. It has also enabled the isolation of DNA fragments which could be used as probes to determine common genomic regions among the many serotypes of rhinoviruses.This would allow construction of a genomic map of common and unique sequences within the rhinovirus family.OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for isolating and cloning of DNA representative of the genomic RNA of human rhinoviruses. Another object is to determine the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of HRV type 14 genomic RNA. A third object is to determine the amino acid sequence of precursor proteins utilized during polyprotein processing. Yet another object is to provide a method for producing HRV proteins or subunits thereof by expression of clonedDNA in an appropriate host. Another object is to provide HRV proteins or subunits thereof which will be useful as immunogens to raise antibodies to HRV.Still another object is to provide a vector containing DNA representative of HRV type 14 genomicORNA or part thereof. A further object is to provide for construction of an infectious cDNA plasmid capable of yielding infectious virus particles when placed in an appropriate host.Another object is to produce a monoclonal antibody capable of blocking the binding of a major group of rhinoviruses. A further object is to produce monoclonal antibodies to rhinovirus structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 that neutralize the infectivity of the virus. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION DNA fragments encoding the entire 9212 nucleotides of HRV 14 genome RNA have been molecularly cloned and their nucleotide sequence completely determined. Eight monoclonal antibodies have been isolated which neutralize infections HRV 14 virions. In addition, a mouse monoclonal antibody was isolated which specifically blocked the attachment of at least 75 antigenically distinct serotypes of HRVs to cellular receptors.DETAILED DESCRIPTION Plaque purified human rhinovirus type 14 was grown and purified by isopycnic banding in a metrizamide 2 3 acetamido 5 N methylacetamido 2,4,6 triiodobenzamido 2 deoxy D glucose gradient.Purified virus was disrupted with detergents and capsid proteins digested with proteinase K. GenomicRNA was isolated by oligo dT cellulose chromatography and purified by velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient. RNA sedimenting at 35S, relative to ribosomal RNA markers, was collected and ethanol precipitated. Recovered genomic RNA was used as a template for synthesis of its complementary strand to produce a double stranded DNA molecule corresponding to at least a portion of the original genome RNA. The double stranded DNA was modifed to provide sticky ends and was placed into a bacterial plasmid pBR 322. Prokaryotic organisms were exposed to the resulting vector and those which stably incorporated the vector were identified and isolated. Vector DNA was extracted from these hosts and this material was characterized. Vector DNA was first analyzed for size of the HRV cDNA insert and vectors containing the largest inserts mapped for their relationship to the viral RNA genome and each other. Selected vectors containing DNA sequences representing the entire length of the HRV genome RNA were sequenced using a known sequencing method.Fragments of these vectors were radioactively labeled and isolated prior to sequencing. By overlapping the sequences obtained from these fragments, the entireHRV 14 sequenece was determined. Subsequent conversion of the DNA sequence to RNA and protein was made by computer. Determination of the amino acid sequence allows one to determine the structure of the virus and to identify its structural and nonstructural proteins. Knowledge of the viral structure allows inferences to be made as to likely viral receptor sites, proteolytic cleavage sites, and neutralization sites of the virus. The cloned DNA is available for genetic analysis and modification and for use in the development of antiviral compounds.Expression in suitable hosts would yield large quantities of viral proteins for development of antiviral compounds or subunit vaccines. The use of recombinant DNA techniques is described in many published articles, for example,Maniatis et al, Molecular Cloning, A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1982, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In order to generate monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the infectivity of HRV 14 or that block the binding of many HRV serotypes to the virus receptor on susceptible cells, mice were immunized with either purified virions or whole cells and cell membranes enriched for HRV receptor sites, e.g., HeLa cells. Hybridomas were produced following fusion of spleen cells of immunized mice with mouse myeloma cells. From the resulting hybridoma cell lines eight monoclonal antibodies were isolated which are capable of neutralizing HRV 14. In addition, a monoclonal antibody was selected that was capable of blocking the attachment of at least 75 different serotypes ofHRV to receptor sites on susceptible cells. The specific serotypes which were unable to cause infection in the presence of the monoclonal antibody as well as those serotypes which were able to cause infection in the presence of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention are shown in Table I. As a result of these experiments it has been determined that human rhinoviruses consist of a major group and a minor group. The major group is neutralized or rendered incapable of causing infection by the monoclonal antibody while the minor groups seems unaffected by the monoclonal antibody.

This characteristic of the antibody of the present invention is shown in Table II. Human rhinoviruses labeled with S35 methionine were bound to susceptible cell membranes in vitro and unbound virus was removed by washing. Increasing amounts of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention were added to the membranes and the amount of bound virus that was released was measured. The monoclonal antibody of the present invention is useful to prevent HRV infection or to ameliorate the duration and severity of infection.Treatment of susceptible cells with the monoclonal antibody of the present invention renders the cells resistant to viral infection for a period of up to 12 hours following removal of excess antibody. The monoclonal antibody may be prepared in a suitable topical formulation for administration in the form of drops or as a spray. The dosage may range of from about 1.5 to about 150 ug given at intervals of from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, and more usually in a range of from about 5 to about 25 ijg given at intervals of about 4, 8 or 12 hours. A typical formulation employs the monoclonal antibody of the present invention in PBS containing a stabilizer, e.g., 20 SPGA.

EXAMPLE 1 Virus Growth and Purification HRV 14 was obtained from the American TypeCulture collection Rockville, MD , ATCC VR 284 and plaque purified by standard techniques Yin et al.,J. Virol. 12 108 113, 1973 . Plaque purified HRV was propagated on HeLA R19 cells, a subclone of HeLa cells derived by standard procedures Coller t al.,Hybridoma 2 91 96, 1983 . Cells were routinely propagated in growth medium GM McCoy s 5A medium containing 10 fetal calf serum, 30 mM MgC12 and 2Q units ml penicillin and 20 vg ml streptomycin.HeLa Rl9 monolayers were infected at a MOI of 1 and harvested when cells detached freely from the flask surface usually 16 24 hours . The cells suspension was frozen and quickly thawed to release virus particles from the cells. After clarification by centrifugation at slow speed 4000 x g for 5 minues at 40C , Polyethylene glycol 6000 PEG 6000 and NaCI were added to concentrations of 7 and 2.2 respectively and the mixture stirred at 40C for 4 16 hours. The precipitated virus was recovered by centrifugation 10,500 x g for 15 minutes at 40C and resuspended in 10 mM R buffer a solution containing 10 mM tris HC1 pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid , 0.2 M NaC1, 50 mM MgC12 and 10 glycerol .Sodium deoxycholate and polyoxyethylene 9 octaphenol were added to concentrations of 0.38 and 0.6 , respectively, for 30 minutes on ice and the suspension clarified by centrifugation 4000 x g for 5 minutes at 40C . The supernatant liquid 7.5 ml was layered over a 5 ml linear density gradient of 40 60 w v metrizamide in R buffer lacking the glycerol. Isopycnic banding of the virus sample was achieved by centrifugation for 24 hours at 150,000 x g in a Beckman SW40 rotor. Virus bands were generally the densest of the visible bands in the gradient and were harvested manually by bottom puncture. After dilution, 3 fold in R buffer the virus was repelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 x for 2 hours. EXAMPLE 2 Genomic RNA Isolation HRV 14 purified from forty 150 cm flasks of HeLa Rl9 cells was resuspended in 0.9 ml 10 mM Tris HC1, 1 mM EDTA, 0.38 SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate , pH 7.5. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml and the viral proteins digested for 30 minutes at 37 C. The digested mixture was heated to 950C for 1 minute and then quick chilled in an ice bath. NaCI was added to 0.5M and the solution passed through a 1 cm x 0.7 cm column of oligo dT cellulose column CollaborativeResearch, Lexington, Mass. Genomic RNA retained on the column was eluted with H2O and precipitated at 200C with ethanol.Pelleted RNA was resuspended in 0.3 ml of a solution containing 10 mM Tris, 1 mMEDTA, 0.5 SDS, pH 7.5, and layered on a 12 ml preformed gradient from 15 w w to 30 w w sucrose in the same buffer but containing 0.1 M Nail. RNA was sedimented at 23,000 RPM for 17 hours using a BeckmanSW40 rotor. A parallel gradient containing ribosomal 18S and 28S RNAs Bethesda Research Labs., Bethesda,MD was centrifuged at the same time. Gradients were fractionated 0.4 ml by an ISCO gradient fractionator and the OD260 of each fraction measured. A major peak of viral RNA sedimenting at 35S, relative to the position of 18S and 28S in the parallel marker gradient, was pooled and precipitated twice with ethanol at 200C.

Each transformation reaction was plated 250 pg onto 4 agar petri plates containing tetracycline 15 pg ml Maniatis et al., op. cit., p. 70 72 . Each plate yielded approximately 30 colonies after 16 hours of incubation at 370C. EXAMPLE 7 Characterization of Selected Clones Colonies 354 from Example 6 were picked with a toothpick and used to inoculate 200 pl of L broth containing 12 pg ml tetracycline in 96 well serological plates. Following a 16 hour incubation at 370C, 20 p1 of the new growth culture was used to inoculate 2 ml L broth containing 12 ng Na2HPO4, 6 ng KH2PO4, 1 ng NaCl, 2 ng NH4C1, and 4 pg glucose. After shaking at 370C for 16 hours, 0.5 ml was frozen after adding glycerol to 15 and stored at 700C. The remaining 1.5 ml was pelleted 1 minute at 12,000 x g and the supernatant liquid discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 0.15 ml of a solution containing 8 w v sucrose, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 5 v v polyoxyethylene 9 octaphenol and 0.6 mg ml lysozyme and incubated 5 minutes at 250C.The bacteria were then placed in a boiling water bath for 40 seconds and immediately plunged into an ice bath.Following centrifugation for 15 minutes at 12,000 x g, the pellet was removed with a toothpick and discarded. An equal volume of isopropanol was added to the supernatant liquid and the solution mixed and placed at 200C for 10 minutes. After pelleting for 5 minutes at 12,000 x g, the supernatant liquid was removed and the pellet washed with 70 v v ethanol and dried. The resulting plasmid DNA was resuspended in 50 pl H20 and stored at 200C. To determine the size of each cDNA insert, 10 pl of each plasmid preparation was digested with the restriction endonuclease Pst I Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis IN as described by the manufacturer. The digests were analyzed by electophoresis in a 1 agarose gel as described Maniatis et al., op. cit., p. 150 . Three cDNA clones, designated 7, 57, and 186, were selected based on size 2000 bp and colony hybridization studies Grunstein and Hogness, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 72 3691 3965, 1975 which indicated that 7 3200 bp and 186 3200 bp did not overlap and that 57 2000 bp bridged both 7 and 186. EXAMPLE 8 Construction of Deletion Subclones Twenty micrograms of clones 7 and 186 Example 7 were digested with 20 units of restriction endonuclease Pst I in a total volume of 30 pl as described by the manufacturer. After separation of plasmid DNA from viral cDNA on a 1 low melt agarose gel FMC Corporation, Rockland, ME , each cDNA insert was extracted by the method of Tautz and Renz Anal. Biochem. 132 14 19, 1983 20 pg bacterial plasmid pUC9 DNA Vieiera et al., Gene 19 259 268, 1982 was digested with Pst I as described above and mixed with 30 pl of a 1M solution ofTris HCl pH 8.0 containing 20 units of alkaline phosphatase Boehringer Mannheim for 2 hours at 650C. The mixture was extracted twice with phenol chloroform and the pUC9 DNA ethanol precipitated. One pg 0.5 p mole of both insolated clone 7 and 186 inserts were ligated separately to 2.8 pg 1.0 p mole of digested pUC9 DNA with 2.5 units of T4 DNA ligase BRL, Gaithersburg, MD in 10 pl of a solution containing 5 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgC12, 20 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 0.001 polyoxyethylene 9 octaphenol at 150C for 2 hours. E. coli strain HB101 Gene 6 23 28, 1979 was transformed with each of the above ligation mixtures and transformants selected on agar plates containing 100 vg ml ampicillin. The orientation of each insert in pUC9 plasmid was determined in relation to the orientation of the LAC gene. An A orientation of the insert is the same orientation as the LAC gene and a B is the reverse. Two hundred pg of pUC9 7A and pUC9 186B were linearized withDNase I Boehringer Mannheim in the presence of 1 mMMnClZ and DNAs precipitated with PEG 6000 according to the method of Hong J. Mol. Bio. 158 539 549, 1982 . Full length DNA was separated by gel electrophoresis described above and recovered from the agarose by the method of Wieslander Anal.Biochem. 98 305, 1979 . Ten pg of linearized pUC9 7A or pUC9 186B were digested with 20 units of restriction endonuclease Sal I Boehringer Mannheim in 40 l as described by the manufacturer. The reaction mixtures were then heated to 650C for 5 minutes and 3 pl 1.0M Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 pl 0.25M MgC12, 12 pl of a solution containing 0.1 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 pl H2O, and 1 pl 2.5 units large fragment of DNA polymerase Boehringer Mannheim were added and incubated at 370C for 30 minutes. Following an incubation at 650C for 10 minutes, the DNA was precipitated by adding 60 pl of 10 PEG 6000 and 1.25M NaCl and incubated on ice for 1.5 hours.The DNA was collected by centrifugation 12,000 x g for 10 minutes and dissolved in 50 pl of a solution containing 10 mMTris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM NaCl. The DNA was then extracted by phenol chloroform and ethanol precipitated for 10 minutes at 700C.The final precipitate was dissolved in 10 pl of a solution containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM NaCl, and mixed with 1.1 pl of a solution containing 0.5M Tris HCl pH 8.0, 0.1M MgC12, 0.2MDTT, 0.01M ATP, and 0.01 polyoxyethylene 9 octaphenol, and 1 pl 10 units T4 DNA ligase NewEngland Nuclear . The mixture was incubated at 150C for 4 hours and used to transform E. coli strainHB101 cells as described above. From 10 pg of pUC9 7A and pUC9 186B , 10,000 and 17,000 transformants were obtained, respectively. Deletion clones transformants were screened as described in Example 7 and the size of each DNA insert was determined by restriction endonuclease digestion with BAM HI pUC9 186B clones and with Pst I and Bam HI pUC9 7A clones . EXAMPLE 9 Nucleic Acid Sequencing of cDNA Inserts Digestion of clones 7, 57, and 186 and their subset of deletion clones Example 8 with various commercially available restriction enzymes generated a subset of overlapping DNA fragments. These fragments were radioactively labeled one of two ways. When restriction enzyme digestion resulted in a 5 overhang in double stranded DNA i.e., XBAI , 25 pg of the DNA were labeled by resuspending in 80 pl of a solution containing 50 mM NaCl, 6 mMTris HCl pH 7.5, 6 mM MgC12, 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol and 150 200 uCi a32P deoxynucleotide triphosphate representing the first nucleotide to be specified by the overhang, and 5 units of large fragment of DNA polymerase I Boehringer Mannheim and incubated at 150C for 2 hours. Alternatively, when the restriction enzyme digestion resulted in a 3 overhang in the DNA i.e.Pst I , the DNA was labeled at the 3 end by resuspension in 40 pl of a solution containing 0.2M K cacodylic acid ph 7.0, 2 mM CaC12, 2 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 250 uCi a32p ddATP Amersham, Chicago, IL and 20 units terminal deoxytransferase PL Biochemicals and incubated 1 hour at 370C. Both reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 pl of 0.5M EDTA and labeled DNA separated from unincorporated triphosphates by chromatography through an Elutip Schleicher and Schuell, Keene,NH using the supplier s protocol. Purified DNA was precipitated with ethanol and recut with a second restriction endonuclease which cut asymmetrically between the radioactively labeled ends, generating at least 2 fragments for each labeled fragment.The cut fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 5 w v acrylamide gel 15 x 15 x 0.015 cm containing 42 ml of 29 w v acrylamide Bio Rad , 1 w vN,N bis acrylylcystamine Bio Rad , 0.1 w v ammonium persulfate, 0.38 N,N,N ,N tetramethylene diamine Bio Rad , 90 mM Tris base, 140 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA at 20 mA for 3 hours. The gel was stained in 200 ml of a solution containing 10 mMTris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 1 pg ml ethidium bromide for 30 minutes and DNA bands visualized by W light. Appropriate bands were excised and the DNA recovered by dissolving the acrylamide gel slice in 1 ml of a solution containing 0.2M NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and 40 mM 2 mercaptoethanol for 15 minutes at 250C.The dissolved gel solution was then chromatographed through an Elutip see above and recovered DNA ethanol precipitated. EXAMPLE 10 Sequence Determination DNA fragments, labeled with 32p at only one end as described in Example 9, were sequenced using the chemical DNA sequencing methods described by Maxam and Gilbert Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 65.1980 . Synthetic deoxynucleotide primers and Sanger Zimmern et al., P.N.A.S. 75 4257 4261, 1978 dideoxy sequencing techniques were used to complete the determination of the nucleotide sequence. A continuous DNA sequence of 7,209 nucleotides was obtained using the Intelligenetics software package.This nucleotide sequence and the amino acids inferred therefrom follow.

TTATAAAAAA AAAAAAAAA Nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequences for the various structural and nonstructural HRV14 proteins are indicated.Nomenclature employed is based upon that used for the polioviruses. Neutralizing epitopes to HRV14 have been mapped to each of the VP1, VP2 and VP3 virus structural proteins. The virus protease is required for proper proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein inhibition of its activity e.g. by Zn results in blockage of virus replication. Virus coded replicase and VP g is required for synthesis of both plus and minus strands of genomic RNA inhibition of its activity prevents virus replication. EXAMPLE 11Immunization of Mice with Purified Rhinovirus Type 14 The rear footpads of adult BALB C mice were injected with purified whole HRV 14 as obtained according to Example 1. Each mouse footpad received 5 pg of purified HRV 14 dissolved in a volume of 0.1 ml of complete Freund s adjuvant. Mice received a second inoculation 5 pg 0.05 ml footpad at 30 days. Serum was collected from one eye of each mouse 14 days after viral injection and tested for antibody to HRV 14 by neutralization assay Example 14 . Mice that were positive for anti HRV 14 antibodies by neutralization assays as described inExample 14 were primed 3 days prior to the cell fusion by injection of 5 pg of purified HRV 14 in the tail vein in aqueous solution, 0.1 ml mouse . Sera collected at death from the two animals used for the cell fusion were assayed for antibody to HRV 14 by neutralization and found to be positive. EXAMPLE 12 Immunization of Mice with HeLa R19 Cells Adult BALB C mice were injected intraperitoneally with a solution containing HeLa R19 cells Example 1 which were recovered from tissue culture monolayers by treatment with phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 50 mM EDTA for 20 mins. at 370C. Each mouse received 3 x 106 cells suspended in a volume of 0.5 ml of complete Freund s adjuvant. After 38 days, mice were reinoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 107 HeLa R19 cells in a volume of 0.5 ml of incomplete Freund s adjuvant. Three mice that were positive for antibodies which protected cells against HRV 14 infection SeeExample 14 were primed on day 116, 4 days prior to the cell fusion by injection of two OD260 units mouse of crude HeLa cell membranes SeeExample 13 in the tail vein in aqueous solution, 0.05 ml mouse . Sera collected at the death of the three animals used showed the presence of antibody capable of protecting HeLa cells from HRV 14 infection. In another experiment three adult BALB C mice were immunized using the following schedule 2 intraperitoneal inoculations using cell membrane preparations on day 1 and day 42 followed by a final intradermal inoculation of membranes plus incompleteFreund s adjuvant on day 214. Three days later the cell fusion was carried out as described inExample 14. EXAMPLE 13 Preparation of HeLa Cell Membranes HeLa R19 cell monolayers were treated withPBS containing 50 mM EDTA for 20 minutes at 370C. Cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed with PBS 3 times. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer 8 x 107 cells ml and placed on ice for 25 mins. Cells were then disrupted by 20 stokes in a Dounce homogenizer and nuclei removed by centrifugation 1000 x g for 5 minutes at 40C . The supernatant liquid was removed and membranes pelleted at 143,000 x g for 1 hour at 40C in a Beckman TI60 rotor. The supernatant liquid was discarded and the crude membrane pellet dissolved in PBS at 42 OD280 units ml and stored at 700C. EXAMPLE 14 Production of Hybridomas by Fusion of Immune Mouse Spleen Cells with Mouse Myeloma Cells Mouse myeloma cells SP 2 0 were grown from frozen seed stock in HT media. Each 100 ml of HT media contained 66 ml of Dulbecco s Modified Eagle sMedia 20 ml fetal calf serum FCS 10 ml of NCTC 109 with Eagle s balanced salts 2 ml of 200 mM L glutamine 1 ml of a solution containing 408 mg hypoxanthine and 114 mg thymidine in 300 ml of distilled H20 and 1 ml of OPI stock 1.5 g cisoxalacetic acid, 0.5 g pyruvic acid, 2000 units bovine insulin in 100 ml H2O and 0.2 ml of a penicillin 10,000 units ml and streptomycin 10,000 Vg ml mixture.The mouse spleens from animals immunized with HRV 14 Example 12 were removed after cervical dislocation and placed in serumless HT media at room temperature. The spleens were placed in a plastic petri dish and the cells were teased from the spleen with a plastic scraper.The plates were washed with 5 ml of serumless HT media and the cells were pooled into a 15 ml plastic conical tube large particles were allowed to settle for one minute. The supernatant was then transferred to a 15 ml plastic round bottom tube and the cells were pelleted by a 10 minute centrifugation, 350 x g at room temperature. The supernatant liquid was discarded and the cells were resuspended in serumlessHT media 10 ml 2 spleens and the total viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. The number of viable SP 2 0 myeloma cells was also determined and the cells were combined using one log more spleen cells than myeloma cells i.e.into a 50 cc screw cap plastic tube were placed 8 7 2 x 10 spleen cells and 2 x 107 SP 2 0 cells . The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 350 x g and then the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of serumless HT media. This pelleting and resuspension washing procedure was repeated two more times, and after the final resuspension in 10 ml of serumless HT media the cells were transferred to a 15 ml round bottom tube. The cells were pelleted at 350 x g for 10 minutes. Polyethylene glycol PEG molecular weight average 1000d was liquified at 450C and combined with serumless HT media to a concentration of 35 PEG vol vol . The PEG HT media mixture was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22 micron membrane filter fitted on the end of 3 ml syringe the PEG was then maintained at 370C. Dimethylsulfoxide DMSO was added to the PEG media mixture to a final concentration of 5 . The PEG DMSO HT media mixture was added dropwise to the spleen myeloma cell pellett, using 0.8 ml for 2 x 108 cells while gently resuspending the cells by tapping the side of the culture tube and swirling the cells. The cell pellets were centrifuged at 250 x g at room temperature so that the total contact time of the cells with PEG was 6 minutes.The PEG supernatant was then aspirated off and the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of HT media. The cells were pelleted 350 x g for 10 minutes and gently resuspended in HT media to a final concentration of 3.5 x 105 myeloma cells ml. The cells were then plated in 96 well microtiter plates using 0.1 ml well with a pipet and incubated at 370C in a water jacketed C02 incubator with 5 CO2 and 96 humidity. After 24 hours, 0.1 ml of HAT media HT media plus aminopterin at 0.352 mg liter was added to each well. The wells were refed with 0.1 ml of fresh HAT media every 4 to 5 days. Some cells from culture wells which were at a confluency of 15 or greater usually 40 to 80 were tested for production of antibodies to HRV 14 or by a neutralization assay described in Example 15. In other experiments some cells from growth positive wells which were at a confluency of 15 or greater were tested for production of antibodies which block attachment of HRV 14 to cellular receptors in a cell protection assay described in Example 15. From the first set of three mice in Example 12, 837 growth positive wells were obtained, and from the second set of three mice in Example 12, 693 growth positive wells were obtained. Screening of culture fluids from the total 1530 wells resulted in the identification of two hybridoma cultures, one from each set of three mice, producing antibodies capable of blocking the attachment of the major group of human rhinoviruses to susceptible cells. Those cells having high activity by the above assays were subcloned by two cycles of limiting dilutions. Eight subclones A H were selected which had high HRV 14 neutralization activities and one subclone I which was selected in a cell protection assay. The purified monoclonal antibodies from these subclones were characterized as to immunoglobulin subtype and molecular weight by standard procedure.The following results were obtained MONOCLONAL SUBTYPE MOLECULAR WEIGHT Daltons ANTIBODY Heavy Chain Light Chain A IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 B IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 C IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 D IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 E IgG l 49,000 27,000 F IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 G IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 H IgG 2A 49,000 27,000 I IgG 1 49,000 27,000 EXAMPLE 15 Neutralization Cell Protection Assays Neutralization assays were performed as follows HRV 14 106 PFU was incubated with 40 pl of serum or hydridoma tissue culture fluid in a total volume of 0.2 ml GM for 1 hour at 250C. The solution was then transferred to a HeLa R19 cell monolayer 2.5 105 cells in a 24 well cluster plate and incubated 16 24 hours at 340C in a C02 incubator. Wells were scored as positive if no evidence of cytopathic effect was evident compared to controls. Protection assays utilized 48 well cluster plates of HeLa R 19 cells 1.25 x 10 cells well . After removal of media, monolayers were incubated with 0.1 ml serum or hybridoma tissue culture for 1 hour at 34 C. After incubation, 2 x 105 PFUs ofHRV 14 in 50 pl of media were added to the treated monolayer and the cells incubated 16 24 hours at 340C in a CO2 incubator. Wells were scored as positive if no evidence of cytopathic effect was evident compared to controls. Further assays were done to determine if this HeLa receptor antibody would protect cells against infection with other serotypes of HRVs. Positive protection results were obtained with HRV types 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 22, 32, 36, 39, 41, 51, 58, 59, 60, 66, 67, 89, and a clinical isolate of unknown serotype, and coxsackie virus types A13, A18 and A21. All of these serotypes are known to share the same cellular receptor.Four serotypes of rhinovirus which share a different receptor Types 1A, 2, 44, and 49 were not blocked by the antibody. This monoclonal antibody also failed to protect cells against Sabin Type 1 polio virus and coxsackie viruses Types B2 and B3. EXAMPLE 16 Purification of Monoclonal antibodies from Tissue Culture Media and Ascites Fluid The monoclonal antibodies used in experiments were purified from tissue culture fluid taken from growing cultures of the hybridoma cells producing individual antibody. The following procedure was employed and is essentially that described by Emini et al. J. Virol. 43 997 1005, 1982 . Tissue culture fluid, 1 liter, from a particular hybridoma cell line was filtered through aWhatmann 1MM filter paper, a glass wool containing column, and finally a column containing agarose Sepharose 6B . The tissue culture fluid was then adjusted to a pH of 8.0 by the addition of 100 mM tris HCl, pH 8.0, and then passed over a proteinA Sepharose column 4 to 6 ml bed volume per 2 liters of fluid .The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 . Glycine 100 mM pH 3.0 was then added to elute the bound immunoglobulins from the column fractions were collected with 100 mMTris HCl pH 8.0 in the bottom of each tube such that the pH was changed from the acid pH of glycine to the higher pH to stabilize the antibody. Peak protein fractions from the column were pooled, dialyzed against distilled H2O and used as whole antibody or were treated further to obtain Fab fragments. To obtain Fab fragments of the individual monoclonal antibodies, 10 to 15 mg of the antibody purified using protein A columns, as described above, were lyophilized and then dissolved in 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM cysteine, pH 7.2 2 ml 20 mg antibody . Papain, 10 15 units per mg, was added to a ratio of 1 100, enzyme to antibody by weight. This reaction was incubated overnight for 16 hours at 370C and it was terminated with the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 30 mM. The digested antibody was then chromatographed over a cross linked dextran Sephadex G 75 column 2.5 X 20 cm, width x height at 40C and the fractions were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm as a measure of the protein present.The second peak off the column, which contained the majority of the Fab fragments, was pooled and then passed through a proteinA sepharose column to eliminate any contaminating Fc fragments or undigested antibody which bind to the protein A column. The peak fractions of Fab fragments from the protein A column were pooled, dialyzed against distilled H20, and then lyophilized in 200 pg aliquots and stored at 800C. EXAMPLE 17 Crosslinking Monoclonal Antibodies to HRV Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed towards HRV14 were cross linked to the virus by the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinker toluene 2,4diisocyanate TDI , with the following minor adaptations of the procedure described in Emini et al. J.Virol. 43 997 1005, 1982 . Sodium phosphate buffer 10 mM, pH 7.2 was added to dried Fab fragments of a monoclonal antibody, usually to a final concentration of 0.5 pg pl. TDI was then added, 1.1 p1 200 pl of antibody. The antibody Fab fragment was then incubated with the TDI at either 40C or at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by taking aliquots at various times, usually less than 10 minutes, and incubating these aliquots at OOC for 10 minutes to solidify the TDI. The TDI was removed by pelleting the solidified TDI at 2,000 x g at OOC and then repeating the OOC incubation and pelleting steps. The final supernatant liquid then was taken and HRV14 was added to the antibody.HRV was added either as S35 labelled HRV, with 3000 to 7000 cpm. The virus was incubated with the antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature. Saturated tribasic phosphate buffer was added to raise the pH to 9.6 for 10 minutes at room temperature. Saturated monobasic phosphate was then added to lower the pH to 7.0. The samples then were dialyzed against dH2 0 overnight with 3 changes of the water. Each sample was lyophilized to dryness and run on a polyacrylamide gel Laemmli, Nature 227 680 685, 1970 . Following the electrophoresis, the gel was dried and then exposed to X ray film for varying lengths of time. To determine the degree of crosslinking to individual proteins, a densitometer tracing of the X ray film was performed which also gave a quantitative measure of the various viral peaks. The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were found to crosslink to VP1, VP2 or VP3.
