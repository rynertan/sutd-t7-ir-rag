# Electrostatic spray gun apparatus.

## Abstract
A hand manipulable spray gun has an air turbine 37 which is driven at high speed in the order of 60,000 rpm and drives directly an alternator 38 to generate an alternating voltage in the order of 50 volts at about 1000 Hz. The output of this alternator is supplied to a step up transformer 39 to achieve a secondary voltage in the order of 2500 volts. From here, it is supplied to a long chain series voltage multiplier 40 to increase the voltage thereof to one in the order of 55 80 kilovolts. The combination of a relatively small trans former and small capacitance of capacitors 71 to 77 in the voltage multiplier 40 establishes a direct voltage output from the voltage multiplier which has an alternating voltage ripple in excess of fifteen percent. The gun has a wrap efficiency comparable to 75 to 125 kV systems without the danger of using high direct voltages.
