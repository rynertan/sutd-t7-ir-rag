# INSULATION DISPLACEMENT TERMINAL

## Abstract
An insulation displacement terminal comprises a base 20 having a pair of integrally connected side members 22 and 24 . Each side member has slotted end plates 26,28 and 30,32 which are juxtaposed the respective slotted end plates of the other side member to form two pairs of longitudinally spaced plates having co operating slots 34,36 and 38,40 which exert a scissors like action against the conductive core 15 of an insulated electrical conductor 12 which has its insulation 13 pierced as it is forced into the slots.
