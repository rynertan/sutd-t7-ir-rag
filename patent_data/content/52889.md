# Process for high speed extrusion coating using a composition containing a linear low density ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer.

## Abstract
An extrusion coating composition and a process for the extrusion coating of a substrate or article. The extrusion coating composition is comprised of greater than 20 and less than 98 weight percent of a high pressure low density polyethylene homopolymer and or copolymer and greater than 2 and less than 80 weight percent of at least one linear low density ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer.
