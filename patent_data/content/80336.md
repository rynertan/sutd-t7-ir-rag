# ADJUSTABLE WRENCH

## Abstract
A continuously adjustable wrench suitable for use with a range of nut or bolt head sizes and having a handle which is off set or angularly disposed with respect to the wrench head. The wrench provides contact with the nut or bolthead at three spaced, opposing points such that the rotational torque im parted thereto is optimized and the strengt required for the wrench head for a given torque is reduced. In one embodiment, the wrench head is pivotally disposed with respect to the handle either about a single pivot or a double pivot to drive a camming contact surface on the handle into contact with a confronting surface of the nut or bolthead. In another embodi ment, a contact surface is adjustable longitudinally along the handle to be positioned adjacent the nut or bolthead. In a further embodiment, a wrench head is disposed at each end of the handle, and an adjustment screw is provided on the handle for sliding the handle with respect to the wrench heads for con tinuously adjusting both wrench heads simultaneously. The wrench heads of this embodiment may be either pivotally or non pivotally disposed with respect to the handle.
