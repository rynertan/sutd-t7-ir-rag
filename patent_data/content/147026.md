# FUEL INJECTION APPARATUS

## Abstract
Fuel is held under high pressure by an accumulator 7 which is connected with injecting nozzles 3 by respective fuel pipes 14 . The fuel pipes 14 are each provided with a timing control valve 15 and a quantity control valve 16 , and these valves 15, 16 are controlled by an electric control apparatus 24 . The control apparatus 24 controls the timing valve 15 in response to the angular position of the engine crankshaft and controls the quantity control valve 16 in response to the engine load, whereby the injecting nozzle 3 injects the proper quantity of fuel at the proper moment.
