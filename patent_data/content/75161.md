# Switched capacitor modulator.

## Abstract
The moduiator 12 provides a means for simultaneous modulation of two carrier signals CXR1, CXR2 in quadra ture by two input signals 22, 24 in such a way that the gains of the two modulations are exactly the same. A switched capacitor modulator 12 is provided having a plurality of input signal sources for quadrature amplitude modulation. The modulator 12 includes a single common switched capacitor network 14 with multiple switches or multiple switched capacitor networks for each incoming modulating signal. A switched capacitor network utilized to form and modulate a carrier signal for shaping the carrier to reduce sidebands of the third and fifth harmonics in the modulated signal is also disclosed.
