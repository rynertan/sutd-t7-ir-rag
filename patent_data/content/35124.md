# Polymerization catalyst and polymerization process.

## Abstract
An olefin polymerization catalyst is provided compris ing chromium oxide on a titanium containing silica support having at least about 3 weight percent titanium in combina tion with an organoboron promoter. The titanium may be incorporated by coprecipitation with the silica gel or added anhydrously or nonanhydrously to the silica gel. The poly merization process comprises the contacting of olefin monomer with the titanium containing chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of an organoboron promoter.
