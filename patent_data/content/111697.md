# Thermal conversion of wastes.

## Abstract
Wastes, in the form of liquids, solids and slurries, are converted to a mixture of a gas and inorganic ash by introducing the waste as a finely atomized spray into a zone heated by means of a hot gas. Contact of the spray particles with the hot gas results in drying the waste and calcining and combusting the dried waste. The process is particularly useful with wastes containing hazardous materials such as radioactive substances.
