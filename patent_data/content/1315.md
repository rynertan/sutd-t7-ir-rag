## Description
Quaternary ammonium compounds are fairly expensive. It has been necessary to add larger amounts of quaternary ammonium compounds to detergents than desired in order to avoid total inactivation in wash solution. Encapsulation of the quaternary ammonium compounds, while preventing inactivation in wash solution, often interferes with the antistatic, fabric softening effectiveness of the quaternary ammonium compounds in subsequent machine drying. The quaternary ammonium antistatic agents also have a tendency to segregate out in a granular detergent admix because of disparities in particle size. Several methods have been used to incorporate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds and organic dispersion inhibitors into detergent compositions. These methods include prilling, i.e. forming the quaternary antistat and dispersion inhibitor into a prill and then admixing said prill with base detergent granules. The prills may be admixed individually, or way be agglomerated together with any of the well known various agglomerating.agents, and then admixed into conventional detergent compositions. Any of the tilling or processing techniques disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,936,537 to Baskerville andSchiro, have been employed to incorporate these antistatic fabric softening compositions into conventional detergent granules. There are several problems with incorporating the intimate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds and organic dispersion inhibitor in detergent compositions which these prior incorporation techniques do not solve. If prills are incorporated or admixed individually, segregation from the ANTISTATIC, FABRIC SOFTENING DETERGENT COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAME This invention relates to detergency compositions where intimate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor are attached to granules containing conventional detergent components. More particularly, this invention relates to spraying molten intimate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds and organic dispersion inhibitors onto spray dried detergent granules to form discrete, distinct particles with fabric softening, antistatic capabilities. Various quaternary ammonium compounds are known in the art to possess antistatic properties. These quaternary ammonium compounds are known to be incompatible with anionic surfactants commonly employed in laundering compositions. Anionic surfactants attack and inactivate the quaternary ammonium compounds in solution by forming insoluble salts . It therefore becomes a problem of shielding the quaternary ammonium compounds in the wash water environment, without disturbing their effectiveness at antistatic fabric softening in the subsequent drying process. Quaternary ammonium compounds are fairly expensive. It has been necessary to add larger amounts of quaternary ammonium compounds to detergents than desired in order to avoid total inactivation in wash solution. Encapsulation of the quaternary ammonium compounds, while preventing inactivation in wash solution, often interferes with the antistatic, fabric softening effectiveness of the quaternary ammonium compounds in subsequent machine drying. The quaternary ammonium antistatic agents also have a tendency to segregate out in a granular detergent admix because of disparities in particle size. Several methods have been used to incorporate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds and organic dispersion inhibitors into detergent compositions. Thsp methods include trilling, i.e. forming the quaternary antistat and dispersion inhibitor into a prill and then admixing said prill with base detergent granules. The prills may be admixed individually, or may be agglomerated together with any of the well known various agglomerating agents, and then admixed into conventional detergent compositions. Any of the tilling or processing techniques disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,936,537 to Baskerville andSchiro, have been employed to incorporate these antistatic fabric softening compositions into conventional detergent granules. There are several problems with incorporating the intimate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds and organic dispersion inhibitor in detergent compositions which these prior incorporation techniques do not solve. If prills are incorporated or admixed individually, segregation from the basic composition can result, with concomitant variation in and loss of fabric softening capabilities. Coating intimate mixtures of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor onto base detergent granules, tarnishes those granules with an unattractive, dull, yellow color. Since these intimate mixtures are relatively insoluble in water, coating inhibits base detergent granules from going into solution, and concomitantly increases the amount of insolubles found in wash water solutions. Agglomerating prills together to increase effective particle size may result in increasing amounts of insolubles in wash water solutions, an undesirable result. The friability, or crumbling nature of these agglomerates is relatively high, and results in needless waste of valuable quaternary aYr,oniuiit um product. In addition, the agglomerating process itself is an extra step in preparing detergent compositions which can desirably be eliminated. It is an object of the present invention to provide a particulate additive to laundry detergent compositions to reduce the tendency of fabrics washed with such detergent compositions to generate or retain static electricity when subjected to a subsequent machine drying process. The present invention encompasses a composition for conditioning fabrics comprising a from about 3 to about 40 by weight of an intimate mixture of i from about 80 to about 20 by weight of the mixture of a quaternary ammonium compound of formula R1R2R3R4Ni Y wherein at least one but not more than two of R1 R2I R3, and R4 is an organic radical containing a group selected from a C16 C22 aliphatic radical, or an alkyl phenyl or alkyl benzyl radical having 10 to 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain1 the remaining group or groups being selected from C1 C4 alkyl, C2 C4 hydroxyalkyl, and C3 C8 cyclic structures in which the nitrogen atom or atoms form part of the ring, Y constituting an anionic radical selected from the group consisting of hydroxide, halide, sulfate, methylsulfate, ethylsulfate and phosphate ions, and ii from about 208 to about 80 by weight of a dispersion inhibitor, being a solid organic material having a solubility in water of 50 ppm maximum at 250C and a softening point in the range of 100 F to 200 Ft said material being selected from the group consisting of paraffinic waxes, cyclic and acyclic mono and polyhydric alcohols, substituted and unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids, esters of the foregoing alcohols and acids, C3 Co alkylene oxide condensates of any of the foregoing materials and mixtures thereof, substantially all of said intimate mixture having a solubility in water of about 50 ppm maximum at 250C and having a softening point of about 100oF to about 2000F, said mixture being in the fo n of generally spherical particles having diameters between about 10 microns and about 500 microns, partially embedded in and attached to, b from about 97 to about 60 by weight of spray dried granules comprising i from about 99g to about 5 by weight of surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof, and ii from about 18 to about 95 by weight of a mixture of 1 from about 1t to about 100 by weight of a detergency builder, and 2 up to about 99 by weight of an inert inorganic water soluble salt. The present invention also encompasses a process for preparing a detergent product for conditioning fabrics comprising the steps of a mixing intimately i from about 80 to about 20E by weight of a quaternary ammonium compound of formula R1R2R3R4N Y wherein at least one but not more than two of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is an organic radical containing a group selected from a C16 C22 aliphatic radical, or an alkyl phenyl or alkyl benzyl radical having 10 to 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, the remaining group or groups being selected from C1 C4 alkyl, C2 C4 hydroxyalkyl, and C3 Cs cycle structures in which the nitrogen atom or atoms form part of the ring, Y constituting an anionic radical selected from the group consisting of hydroxide, halide, sulfate, methylsulfate, ethylsulfate and phosphate ions, and ii from about 20E to about 80 by weight of a dispersion inhibitor, being a solid organic material having a solubility in water of 50 ppm maximum at 250C and a softening point in the range of l000F to 2000F, said material being selected from the group consisting of paraffinic waxes, cyclic and acyclic mono and polyhydric alcohols, substituted and unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids, esters of the foregoing alcohols and acids, C3 C4 alkylene oxide condensates of any of the foregoing materials and mixtures thereof, substantially all of said intimate mixture having a solubility in water of about 50 ppm maximum at 250C and having a softening point of about 1000F to about 2000F, b spraying said intimate mixture in a molten state at a temperature of from about 1600F to about 2500F and a pressure of from about 10 psi to about 100 psi through a spray nozzle, and if said spray nozzle is a two fluid atomizer nozzle, the second fluid is air at a temperature of from about 1800F to about 2700F and a pressure of from about 20 psi to about 150 psi, forming generally spherical particles from about 10 microns to about 500 microns in size, partially embedding in and attaching to spray dried granules at a temperature of from about 500F to about 1600F at a distance of from about 6 inches to about 75 inches from said nozzle, so that the intimate mixture of the quaternary ammonium compound and the organic dispersion inhibitor comprises from about 39 to about 40 by weight, and the spray dried granules comprise from about 97 to about 60 by weight, of the composition formed by the attachment, said spray dried granules comprising i from about 99 to about 5 by weight of surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof, and ii from about 1 to about 95 by weight of a mixture of 1 from about 1 to about 100 by weight of a detergency builder, and 2 up to about 99 by weight of an inert inorganic water soluble salt. Description of the Drawings While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which is regarded as forming the present invention, it is believed that invention will be better understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the annexed drawing which describes, discloses, illustrates and shows a preferred embodiment or modification of the present invention and what is presently considered and believed to be the best mode of practicing the principles thereof and wherein Figure 1 is a view of spherical particles of intimate mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor A, which are partially embedded in and attached to a base spray dried detergent granule, B. Figure 2 is a close up view of a spherical particle of intimate mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor A, which is partially embedded in and attached to a base spray dried detergent granule, B. Detailed Description of the Invention The spray on mixture of this invention contains two essential ingredients the quaternary ammonium antistatic agent and the organic dispersion inhibitor. The base detergent compositions of the invention comprise a water soluble detergency compound or surfactant, a detergency builder salt, and an inert inorganic water soluble additive. The quaternary ammonium compound provides antistatic effects on the fabrics and adds an increment of softening benefit to the fabrics while the detergent and builder components provide the known cleansing and building effects.The various components of the compositions herein are described in greater detail hereinafter, together with the methods of spraying the mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor onto the base detergent granules. generally spherical particles , as used herein, is understood to include particles of a generally elliptical nature. The detergent compositions herein provide a solution pH of from about 7 to about 12, preferably from about 9 to about 11, when dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.12 by weight. Antistatic Agent The quaternary ammonium antistatic agent will normally be employed in an amount of from about 80 to about 20 , preferably from about 80 to about 60 , and most preferably from about 80 to about 70 by weight of the intimate mixture with organic dispersion inhibitor. The additive or detergent composition of the invention is employed in providing an aqueous laundering bath or liquor1 and normally contains the intimate mixture in an amount sufficient to provide a concentration of quaternary ammonium compound in the bath or liquor of from about 5 ppm parts per million to about 250 ppm. The antistatic agents useful herein are quaterrary ammonium altos of the formula IR1R2R3R4N Y wherein R1 and preferably R2 represent an organic radical containing a group selected from a C16 C22 aliphatic radical or an alkyl phenyl or alkyl benzyl radical having 10 16 atoms in the alkyl chain, R3 and R4 represent hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, or C2 C4 hydroxy alkyl groups andC3 C8 cyclic structures in which the nitrogen atom or atoms form pa of the ring, and Y is an anion such as halide or methylsulfate. In the context of the above definition, the hydrophobic moiety i.e., the C16 22 aliphatic, C10 16 alkyl phenyl or alkyl benzyl radical in the organic radical R1 nay be directly attached to the quaternary nitrogen atom or may be indirectly attached thereto through an amide, ester, alkoxy, ether, or like grouping. The qua ternary ammonium antistatic compounds useful herein include both water soluble and substantially water insoluble materials. For example, the imidazolinism compounds of the structure EMI11.1 where R is a C1G C20 alkyl group, possess appreciable water solubility but can be utilized in the present invention by mixture with the appropriate level and type of organic dispersion inhibitor so as to give an ultimate particle solubility in water of less than 50 ppm at 25 C. Similarly other relatively water soluble quaternary ammonium anti static agents can be used such as the diisostearyl dimethyl ammonium chlorides disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,395,100 toFisher et al. However, the preferred quaternary harmonium antistatic agents useful herein are characterized by their limited solubility in water. That is to say, such qua ternary salts are essentially insoluble in water, existing therein in what appears to be the nesonorphic liquid crystalline state. The quaternary a onin antistatic agents used in this invention can be prepared in various ways well known in the art. any such naterials are commercially available.The quaternaries are often made from alkyl halide mixtures corresponding to the mixed alkyl chain lengths in fatty acids. For example, the Wdi tallow quaternaries are made from alkyl halides having nixed C14 C18 chain lengths. Such mixed di long chain quaternaries are useful herein and are preferred from a cost standpoint. As noted above, essentially any anionic group can be the counter ion in the quaternary compounds used herein.The anionic groups in the qua ternary compounds can be exchanged, one for another, using standard anion exchange resins. Thus, quaternary ammonium salts having any desired anion are readily available. While the nature of such anions has no effect on the compositions and processes of this invention, chloride ion is the preferred cbunter ion from an availability standpoint. The following are representative examples of substantially water insoluble quaternary ammonium antistatic agents suitable for use in the compositions and processes of the instant invention All of the quaternary ammonium compounds listed can be formulated with the detergent compositions herein, but the compilation of suitable quaternary compounds hereinafter is only by way of example and is not intended to be limiting of such compounds. Dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride is an especially preferred quaternary antistatic agent for use herein by virtue of its high antistatic activity ditallow dimethyl1 ammonium chloride is equally preferred because of its ready availability and its good antistatic activity other useful di long chain quaternary con pounds are dicetyldimethylammonium chloride bis docosyldimethylammonium chloride didodecyldimethylammonium chloride, ditallowdimethylammonium b omi e dioleoyldimethylammonium hydroxide ditallo wdiethyl ammonium chloride ditallowdipropylammonium bromide ditallowdibutylammonium fluoride, cetyldecylmethylethylammonium chloride, bis ditallowdimethylammonium sulfate tris ditallowdimethylammonium phosphate and the like. Suitable examples of quarternary ammonium antistatic compounds .re contained in U.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville and Schiro, ncorporated herein by reference. Orcanic Dispersion Inhibitor The essential organic dispersion inhibitor comprises about 209 to about 80 , preferably from about 20 to about 40 , and most preferably 208 to about 305 by weight of the intimate mixture with quaternary ammonium compound. The dispersion inhibitor should have a solubility in water of 50 ppn flax at 250C and a softening point in the range of 100 F 200 F, prcferably 1250F 2000F1 and is selected fro the group consisting of paraffinic waxes, cyclic and acclic mono and polyhydric alcohols, substituted and unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids, esters of the foregoing alcohols and acids, C3 C4 alkylene oxide condensates of any of the foregoing material and mixtures thereof Preferred herein because of ready availability is tallow alcohol, but useful dispersion inhibitors include other fatty alcohols in the C14 C26 range such as myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Saturated fatty acids having 12 to 24 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain can be used such as lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid a and behenic acid, as well as mixtures of these, particularly those derived from naturally occurring sources such as tallow, coconut, and marine oils. Esters of the aliphatic alcohols and fatty acids are useful dispersion inhibitors, provided they have a total of more than 22 carbon atoms in the acid and alkyl radicals. Long chain C22 C30 paraffinic hydrocarbon materials such as the saturated hydrocarbon octacosane having 28 carbon atoms can also be used. Another preferred class of materials useful in the present invention are the water insoluble sorbitan esters which comprise the reaction product of C12 C26 fatty acyl halides or fatty acids and the complex mixtures of cyclic anhydrides of sorbitol collectively known as sorbitan .The reaction sequence necessary to produce such sorbitan esters from sorbitol is set out schematically below, the esters being shown in the fully esterified form. EMI15.1 1,5 sorbitan 1,4 sorbitan IsosorbideEMI15.2 The sorbitan esters are, in turn, complex mixtures of mono, di, tri, and tetra ester forms, of which the tri and tetra are the least water soluble and hence the most preferred for the purposes of the present invention. However commtrcially available mixtures of the various forms are quite satisfactory provided that the mixture satisfies the water solubility and melting point range constraints for the organic dispersion inhibitor. Typical fatty acids that are suitable for the alkyl portion of the ester are palmitic, stearic, docosanoic, and behenic acids and mixtures of any of these. These sorbitan esters, particularly the tri and tetra esters, provide a degree of fabric softening in addition to their function as dispersion inhibitors. Minor proportions of unsaturated C10 C26 fatty acids, present in corn..ercially available fatty acid mixtures such as coconut , palm , tallow , and marine oil derived acids are also acceptable. Another preferred group of materials are the C20 C mono and di ester forms which also provide a degree of fabric softening performance in addition to their function as dispersion inhibitors. Naterials of this general class are commercially available under various trade names, e.g., the Span series sold by Atlas Chemical Corporation. Suitable examples of organic dispersion inhibitors are contained in U.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville and Schiro, incorporated herein by reference.

The alcohol may be completely linear as occurs in materials derived from natural feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats, or may be slightly branched as occurs in petroleum derived alcohols made by oxo type synthesis.Particularly preferred materials are C14 C15 alcohol condensed with an average of seven ethylene oxide groups, C12 C13 alcohol condensed with an average of about four ethylene oxide groups and then subjected to. stripping to remove unethoxylated and low ethoxylated materials, to leave an ethoxylate having a mean of 4.5 ethylene oxide groups Preferred zwitterionic materials are derivatives of quaternary ammonium compounds containing an aliphatic straight chain group of 14 18 carbon atoms and a sulfate or sulfonate anionic solubilizing group.Specific examples include 3 N,N dimethyl N hexadecyl ammonio 2 hydroxypropane 1 sulfonate 3 N,N dimethyl N tallowyl ammonio 2 hydroxypropane 1 sulfonate 3 ON,8 dimethyl N tetradecyl ammonio propane l sulfonate and 6 N,N dimethyl N hexadecylammonio hexanoate. Suitable examples of surfactants are contained inU.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville and Schiro, incorporated herein by reference. Detergencv 3builders and Inert Inorganic Salts The spray dried granules of the instant invention contain a mixture of detergent builders and inert inorganic watersoluble salts in an amount from about 1 to about 95 by weight, preferably from about 25 to about 85 by weight. This.mixture itself may comprise from about 1 to about 100 preferably from about 10 to about 99 by weight of a detergency builder and up to about 99 preferably from about 1 to about 90 by weight of an inert inorganic water le salt. Useful builders herein include any of t,. nnventional inorganic and organic watersoluble b , salts as well as various water insoluble and so calle seeded builders. In the present compositions these water soluble builder salts serve to maintain the pH of the laundry solution in the range of from about 7 to about 12, preferably from about 8 to about 11.Furthermore, these builder salts enhance the fabric cleaning performance of the overall compositions while at the same time they serve to suspend particulate soil released from the surface of the fabrics and prevent its redeposition on the fabric surfaces.Additionally, in preferred detergent compositions that contain certain smectite clays as fabric softening agents, polyanionic builder salts have been found to cause these smectite type clays to be readily and homogeneously dispersed throughout the aqueous laundering medium with a minimum of agitation. The homogeneity of the clay dispersion is necessary for the clay to function effectively as a fabric softener, while the ready dispersability allows granular detergent compositions to be formulated. Suitable detergent builder salts useful herein can be of the polyvalent inorganic and polyvalent organic types, or mixtures thereof. Non limiting examples of suitable water soluble, inorganic alkaline detergent builder salts include the alkali metal carbonates, borates, phosphates, polyphosphates, tripolyphosphates, bicarbonates, and silicates.Specific examples of such salts include the sodium and potassium tetraborates, bicarbonates, carbonates, tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and hexametaphosphates. Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builder salts are 1 water soluble amino polyacetates, e.g., sodium and potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetates, nitrilotriacetates, and N 2 hydroxyethyl nitriloacetates 2 water soluble salts of phytic acid, e.g., sodium and potassium phytates 3 water soluble polyphosphonates, including, sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethane l hydroxy l,l diphosphonic acid sodium, potassium, and lithium salts of methylenediphosphonic acid and the like. Additional organic builder salts useful herein include the polycarboxylate materials described in U.S Patent 2,264,103, including the water soluble alkali metal salts of mellitic acid. The water soluble salts of polycarboxylate polymers and copolymers such as are described in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, incorporated herein by reference, are also suitable herein. It is to be understood that while the alkali metal salts of the foregoing inorganic and organic polyvalent anionic builder salts are preferred for use herein from an economic standpoint, the ammonium, alkanolanmonium, e.g., triethanolammonium, diethanolammonium, and the like, watersoluble salts of any of the foregoing builder anions are useful herein. Mixtures of organic and or inorganic builders can be used herein. One such mixture of builders is disclosed in Canadian Patent 755,038, e.g., a ternary mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate, trisodium nitrilotriacetate, and trisodium ethane l hydroxy l, 1 diphosphonate. A further class of builder salts is the insoluble alumino silicate type which functions by cation exchange to remove polyvalent mineral hardness and heavy metal ions from solution. A preferred builder of this type has the formulationNAz Al02 z Si02 y . x H20 wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5 and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.Compositions corporating builder salts of this type form the subject of Br h patent specification NO 1.429.143. Another type of detergency builder material useful in the present compositions and processes comprises a watersoluble material capable of forming a water insoluble reaction product with water hardness cations in combination with a crystallization seed which is capable of providing growth sites for said reaction product. Such seeded builder compositions are fully disclosed in Canadian Patent NO 992,832. More particularly, the seeded builders usefull herein comprise a crystallization seed having a maximum particle dimension of less than 20 microns, preferably a particle diameter of from about 0.01 micron to about 1 micron, in combination with a material capable of forming a water insoluble reaction product with free metal ions. Many builder materials, e.g., the water soluble carbonate salts, precipitate water hardness cations, thereby performing a builder function. Unfortunately, many of the precipitating builders used in laundry compositions do not reduce the free metal ion content of laundry baths quickly, and such builders only compete with the organic detergent and the soil for the free metal ions. Tile result is that while some of the free metal ions are removed from the solution, some ios do react with the organic detergent and the soil, thereby decreasing the detersive action. The use of the orystnl lization send quickens the rate of precipitation of the ital cations thereby removing the hardness before it can adversely affect detergency performance. By using 2 material capable of forming a waterinsoluble product with free metal ions in combination with a crystallization seed, the combined Ca and Mg free metal ion concentration of an aqueous laundering liquor can be reduced to less than 0.5 grains oE hardness within about 120 seconds. Xn fact, the preferred seeded builders can reduce the free metal hardness to less than 0.1 grains gallon within about 30 seconds. Preferred seeded builders consist of a watersoluble material capable of forming a reaction product having a solubility in water of less than about 1.4 x 10 2 wt. at 250C with divalent and polyvalent metal ions such as calcium, magnesium and iron and a crystallization seed 0.001 20 micron diameter which comprises a material which will not completely dissolve in water within 120 seconds at 250C. Specific examples of materials capable of forming the water luble reaction product include the watersoluble salt carbonates, bicarbonates, sesquicarbonates, silicates, alum ates and oxalates. The alkali metal, especially sodium, salts of the foregoing materials are preferred for convenience and economy, The crystallization seed employed in such seeded builders is preferably selected from the group consisting of calcium carbonate calcium and magnesium oxalates barium sulfate calciwn, magnesium and aluminum silicates calcium and nagnesium oxides calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids having 12 to 22 carbon atoms calcium and magnesium hydroxides calcium fluoride and barium carbonate.Specific examples of such seeded builder mixtures comprise 3 1 wt. mixtures of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate having a 5 micron particle diameter 2.7 1 wt. mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate and calcium carbonate having a particle diameter of 0.5 microns, 20 1 wt. mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate and calcium hydroxide having a particle diameter of 0.01 micron and a 3 3 1 wt. mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium aluminate and calcium oxide having a particle diameter of 5 microns. A seeded builder comprising a mixture of sodium carbon ate and calcium carbonate is especially preferred herein. A highly preferred seeded builder comprises a 30 1 to 5 1 wt. Na2CO3 CaCO3 mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate wherein the calcium carbonate has an average particle diameter from 0.01 micron to 5 microns. Another type of builder useful herein includes various substantially water insoluble materials which are capable of reducing the hardness content of laundering liquors, e.g., by ion exchange processes. Examples of such builder materials include the phosphorylated cloths disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,424,545 to Bauman issued January 28, 1969, incorporated herein by reference. Inert inorganic water soluble salts which are included in the above mixtures include any of the well known alkali metal halide salts, and alkali metal sulfates such as sodium sulfate or potassium sulfate. Suitable examples of detergency builders and inert inorganic salts are contained in U.S. Patent 3,936,537,Baskerville and Schiro, incorporated herein by reference. Clay Compounds A valuable optional ingredient of the present compositions consists of particular smectite clay materials, namely sodium and calcium montmorillonites, sodium saponites, and sodiun hectorites. These smectite clays can be present in compositions of this invention at levels from about 5 to about 90 by weight, preferably from about 8 to about 75 by weight.In the built detergent composition emhodinents of this invention, ul nectite clay is used in an amount from about 13 to about 5 preferably from about 5 to about 25t by weight. The c used herein are impalpable , i.e., have a particle size which cannot be perceived tactilely.Impalpable clays have particle sizes below about 50 microns the clays used herein have a particle size range of from about 5 microns to about 50 microns. The clay minerals can be described as expandable, three layer clays1 i.e., altumino silicates and m.agnesitm silicates, having an ion exchange capacity of at least 50 meg 100 g. of clay and preferably at least 60 meq 100 g. of clay. The tern expandable as used to describe clays relates to the ability of the layered clay structure to be swollen, or expanded, on contact with water. The three layer expandable clays used herein are those materials classified geologically as smectites. There are two distinct classes of smectite clays that can be broadly differentiated on the basis of the numbers of octahedral metal oxygen arrangements in the central layer for a given number of silicon or.ygen atoms in the outer layers.The dioctahedral minerals are primarily trivalent netal ion based clays and are comprised of the pro to type pyrophyllite and the membres montmorillonite OH 4Si8 yAly Al4 xMgx O20, nontronite OH 4Si8 yAly Al4 xFex O20, and volchonskoite OH 4Si8 yAly Al4 xCrx O20, where x has a value of from 0 to about 4.0 and y has a value of fron 0 to about 2.0.Of these only montmorillonites having exchange capacities greater than 50 meg 100 g. are suitable for the present invention and provide fabric softening benefits. The trioctahedral minerals are primarily divalent petal ion based ar.d comprise the prototype talc and the members hectorite OH 4Si8 yAly Mg6 xLix O20, saponite OH 4 Si8 yAly Mg6 xAlx O20, sauconite OH 4Si8 yAly Zn6 xAlx O20, vermiculite OH 4Si8 yAly Mg6 xFex O20, wherein y has a value of 0 to about 2.0 and x has a value of 0 to about 6.0. Hectorite and saponite are the only minerals in this class that are of value in the present invention, the fabric softening performance being related to the type of exchangeable cation as well as to the exchange capacity. It is to be recognized that the range of the water of hydration in the above formulas can vary with the processing to which the clay has been subjected.This is immaterial to the use of the smectite clays in the present invention in that the expandable characteristics of the hydrated clays are dictated by the silicate lattice structure. As noted hereinacove, the clays employed in the comsosiWions of the instant invention contain cationic counterions such as protons, sodium ions, potassium ions, calcium ions, and lithium ions. It is customary to distinguish between clays on the basis of one cation pre don.inntly or exclusively absorbed. For example, a sodium clay is one in which the absorbed cation is predominantly sodium. Such absorbed cations can become involved in exchange be sections with cations present in aqueous solutions.A typical e age reaction involving a smectite type clay is expressed be he following equation smectite clay Na NH4OHEMI31.1 smectite clay NH4 NaOHSince the foregoing equilibrium reaction, one equivalent weight of ammonium ion replaces an equivalent weight of sodium, it is customary to measure cation exchange capacity sometimes termed base exchange capacity in terms of milli equivalents per 100 g. of clay neq 100 g. . The cation exchange capacity of clays can be measured in several ways, including by electrodialysis, by exchange with awmoni8n ion followed by titration or by a methylene blue procedure, all as fully set forth in Grimshaw, The Chemistry andPhysics of Clays , pp. 254 265, Interscience 1971 .The cation exchange capacity of a clay mineral relates to such factors as the expandable properties of the clay, the charge of the clay, which, in turn, is determined at least in part by the lattice structure, and the like. The ion exchange capacity of clays varies widely in the range from about 2 meg 100 g. of kaolinites to about 150 meg lOC g., and greater, for certain snectite clays. Illita clays although having a three layer structure, are of a non expanding lattice type and five an ion exchange capacity so newhere in the lower portion of the range, i.e., around 26 meg 100 g. for an average illite clay.Attapulgites, another class of clay minerals, have a spicular i.e. needle like crystalline form with a low cation exchange capacity 25 30 meq 100 g. .Their structure is composed of chains of silica tetrahedrons linked together by octahedral groups of oxygens and hydroxyls containing Al and Mg atoms. It has been determined that illite, attapulgite, and kaolinite clays, with their relatively low ion exchange capacities, are not useful in the instant compositions. Indeed, illite and kaolinite clays constitute a major component of clay soils and, as noted above, are removed from fabric surfaces by means of the instant compositions. However the alkali mental montmorillonites, saponites, and hectorites, and certain alkaline earth metal varieties of these ninerals such as calcium montmorillonites have been found to show useful fabric softening benefits when incorporated in coxpositions in accordance with the present invention. Specific non limiting examples of such fabric softening smectite clay ninerals are Sodium Montmorillonite Brock Volclay BC Gelwhite GP Thixo Jel , 1 Ben A Gel Sodium mectoris Veegum F Laponite SP Sodium Saponite Barasym NAS 100 Calcium Montmorillonite Soft Clark Gelwhite L Imvite ithium Hectorite Barasym LIH 200Accordingly, smectite clays useful herein can be characterized as montmorillonite, hectorite, and saponite clay minerals having an ion exchange capacity of at least about 50 meq lOO g. ard preferably at least about 60 meq 100 g. While not intending to be linited by theory, it appears that the advantageous softening and potentially dye scavenging etc. benefits of the instant compositions are ascribable to the physical characteristics and ion exchange properties of the clay minerals used therein. Furthermore, the unique physical and electrochemical properties of the smectite clays apparently cause their interaction with, and dispersion by, the poly anionic builder salts used in the instant compositions.Thus, it has no been found that, rather than agglomerating to form viscous gels when contacted by water, the smectite clays used herein can be added to aqueous laundry baths in granular compositions containing poly anionic detcrgncy builders of the type disclosed herein to yield hoogeneous, clay suspensions. the problems of gelling and agglomeration usually encountered when smectite clays are added to aqueous media in solid form are alleviated by the presenca of the builder.Apparently, the negative electrical charges on the builder anions serve to repulse the clay particles, thereby providing the desired homogeneous clay dispersion and preventing agglomeration. Whatever the reason for the advantageous co action of the detergency builder and smectite clays used herein, the combination of poly anionic detergency builders with the specific aluninum containing and magn2sium containing smectites, provides a means whereby such smectite clay minerals can be added in solid form to surfactant containing media so as to give the homogeneous clay dispersion required for effective fabric softening performance. Most of the smectite clays useful in the compositions herein are co nercially available under various tradenames, for example, Thixo Jei tl and Gelwhite GP from Georgia Kaolin Co.,Elizabeth, New Jersey Volclay BC and volclay 325, frogAmerican Colloid Co., Skokie, Illinois and Veeg F, fromR. T. Vanderbilt. It is to be recognized that such smectite minerals obtained under the foregoing tradenames can comprise mixtures of the various discrete mineral entities. Such mixtures of the smectite minerals are suitable for use herein. Within the classes of montmorillonite, hectprite, and saponite clay minerals having a cation exchange capacity of at least about 50 meg 100 g, certain clays are preferred for fabric softening purposes. For example, Gelwhite GP is an extremely white forn.. of smectite clay and is therefore preferred when formulation white granular detergent coinpositions. Volclay BC, which is a smectite clay mineral containing at least 3 of iron expressed as Fe2O3 . in the crystal lattice, and which has a very high ion exchange capacity, is one of the most efficient and effective clays for use in laundry compositions ar.d is preferred from the standpoint of product performance. On the other hand, certain smectite clays marketed under the name bentonite are sufficiently contaminated by other silicate minerals, as evidenced by a low colloid content X50z that r r ion exchange capacity falls below the requisite range, nd such clays are of no use in the instant cottipositions. Bentonite, in fact, is a rock type originating from volcanic ash and contains montmorillonite one of the smectite clays as its principal clay component. The Table shows thar materials commercially available under the name bentonite can have a wide range of cation exchange capacities and fabric softening performance.

The smectite clay materials useful in the present invention are hydrophilic. in nature, i.e. they display swelling charact .. Lcs in aqueous media. Conversely they do not swell in nonaguecii ir predominantly nonaqueous systems, including those incorp. ing the smectite clay minerals described hereinbefore should restrict the non ionic content of the surfactant system to less than 334 by weight of the total surfactart, preferably less Lhan 25s. Suitable examples of clay compounds are contained inU.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville and Schiro, incorporated herein by reference. Other Optional Components Optional components include color speckles which may be admixed with the spray dried base detergent granules. These color speckles may comprise a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate, dextrin glue solution, and minor components.The color speckles may also comprise spray dried anionic detergent granules agglomerated with dyed polyethylene glycol, such as PEG 6000 molecular weight , or other suitable agglomerating agents. Color speckles may be present in compositions of this invention at levels from about 1 to 50E by weight, preferably from about 1 to about 25 by weight, and most preferably from about 18 to about 15 by weight. Additionally, a small amount of alkyl polyethoxylate, such as coconut alcohol polyethoxylate EO6 o may be included in these compositions, i.e. from about 0.1 to about 1.0 by weight of the final detergent composition. Another optional ingredient that may be incor porated is an enzyme for removal of protein based or carbo hydrate based stains. Enzymes for removing protein based stains are proteolytic in nature such as those sold under the trade naves Alcalase and Esterase by Novo Industries A s. Denmark or under the trade names Maxatase and AZ ProteaseZ by Gist Brocades N.V. The Netherlands. These materials are normally incorporated at levels of up to 1 by weight, preferably 0.25 to 0.75 by weight, and are pre ferably coated or prilled with inert additives to minimize dust formation end improve storage stability.A wide range of enzyme materials and means for their incorporation into synthetic detergent granules is disclosed in U.S.P. 3,553,139 issued on January 5, 1971, to McCarty, Roald, DeOude, Blomeyer, and Cracco which disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference. A further ingredient that may be incorporated to improve product perfornance is a bleaching agent of the halogen or oxygen containing type. Examples of the hypohalite bleach type include trichloro isocyanuric acid and the sodium and potassium dichloroisocyanurates and M chloro and N bro.m.o alkane sulphonamides. Such materials are normally added at O.5 lO by weight of the finished product, preferably 1 5 by weight. Examples of oxygen containing bleaches include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, and potassium nonopersulphate that are incorporated at levels of 5 3CX, preferably 10 25 by weight of the final product. The inclusion of organic bleach activators such as phthalic anhydride, tetra acetyl ethylene dianine, tetra acetyl methylene diamine or tetra acetyl glycouril lead to. the in situ production during the washing process of the corresponding organic acids which have enhanced low temperature bleaching perform Activators of this type are normally used with sodium parborate, at usage levels of 5 15 by weight of the final product. Materials to boost or modify the sudsing pattern of the compositions of the present invention may also be included.Examples of suds boosters include coconut and tallow mono and di alkanolamides, particularly ethanolamides and C12 15 alkyl di lower alkyl amine oxides. Typical suds depressors include long chain fatty acids such as those disclosed in U. S. Patent 2,954,347 issued September 27, 1960, to Wayne St. John and combinations of certain nonionics therewith as disclosed in U. S. Patent 2.954,343 issued September 27, 1960. to Eugene Schwoeppe. both disclosures being incorporated herein by reference. Other optional ingredients in granular products include hydrotropes acid anticaking additives such as salts of lower alkaryl sulphonic acids, salts of a sulphosuccinic acid, and a sulphobenzoic acid, and urea, normally utilized at levels of 0.5 to 53 by weight of the final product, preferably at levels of 1 3 by weight. C12 C18 alkyl acid phosphates and their condensation products with ethylene oxide may also be incorporated at similar levels for control of crutcher mix viscosity. Antiredeposition agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and their derivatives may also be incorporated. Advantageously, ingredients may also be included to minimize the wrinkling. of fabrics that occurs during conventional drying processes. Detergent products incorporating starch and other particulate materials useful as fabric conditioning agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,892,681 issued July 1, 1975, and incorporated herein by reference.A non limiting example of such a fabric conditioning agent is corn starch, which can be added at a level of 0.1 5.08 by weight of the composition, preferably 0.25 1.0 . Anti tarnish and anti corrosion agents, perfume and colour may also be included, the last ingredient being conveniently added either as a general colour or in the for of a speckle applied to a separate granule fraction of tha entire formulation or to a granulate of one or more of the ingredients.Brightener and fluorescent lighting agents may also be included. The pH of detergent formulations.in accordance with the present invention can lie anywhere within the range 5 12 but is preferably chosen to fall within the range 8 0 10 5 as this provides a slight particulate soil removal benefit on synthetic fabrics. However, the use of specific optional components such as enzymes may require the selection of a product pH that will permit optimum functioning of the con onent concerned. Suitable examples of other optional detergent additives are contained in U.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville and Schiro, incorporated herein by reference. Composition Usage Levels of product addition to give from about 10 ppm to about 250 ppm, preferably from about 40 ppm to about 100 ppm of antistatic agent in solution are generally used. Where the additive forms part of a combination product providing, for example, presoak capability the formulation will typically comprise about 1 to about 30 , preferably 5 to 20 by weight of the attached particulate antics tat intimate mixture, from about 18 to about 25 , preferably from about to about 208 of a detergent surfactant, from about 10 to xt 80 , preferably from about 20 to about 60 of a dete 4 builder, from about 5 to about 45 , preferably from about 10 to about 30 by weight of a bleach, and from about 0.05 to about 2.0 , preferably from about 0.1t to about 1.0 by weight of a detergency enzyme. Compositions of this type are designed to deliver approximately 100 500 ppm builder concentration to a 5 8 gallon soak solution when employed at the 1 2 to 1 1 2 cup usage level which is common practice in household laundering processes. Fully formulated detergent compositions, in addition to providing the solution concentration of detergency builder specified above, provide a surfactant concentration in the range 50 500 ppm, more preferably 150 250 ppm in a 5 8 gallon wash solution. Surfactant level in product will normally range from 1 to 50 , preferably 10 to 25 by weight of the composition. In use, the detergent additive product may be in contact with the fabrics for 1 to 24 hours if employed as, or as part of, a presoak treatment following which the wash liquor is removed and replaced by fresh water and detergent, and the fabrics are laundered. when used directly in the laundring operation either as a separate additive product or aj tart of a fully formulated detergent composition, the solution containing the suspended particulate antistat additive is in contact with the fabrics for 10 to 45 minutes, following which, the fabrics are rinsed and spun dry before being subjected to temperatures of 125 F 200 F in a conventional rotary dryer.During the drying process, the particulate antics tat product softens as the fabrics approac the dryer air temperature, and the tumbling action of the dryer causes the individual particles of material to crayon or smear, thus distributing the quaternary antistat over the surface of the fabrics and minimizing the build up of static charges on the fabrics. Method of Preparation Compositions are prepared by spraying a molten mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor onto spray dried base detergent granules comprising surfactant, detergency builders, and any other optional ingredients. This preparation eliminates prilling and agglomerating used in preparing current compositions. Initially an intimate mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor is prepared. This mixture is then sprayed in a molten state through a spray nozzle onto spray dried detergent base granules in a mixing drum. Any of the spray nozzles known in the art are suitable for the spraying, including single fluid nozzles and two fluid nozzles. Preferred are two fluid nozzles in which air is the second fluid and where the air temperature is from about 1800F to about 2700F, preferably from about 2000F to about 2600F, and most preferably from about 2000F to about 25O0F, and the air pressure is from about 20 psi to about 150 psi, preferably from about 40 psi to about 120 psi, and most preferably from about 80 psi to about 110 psi.The molten intimate mixture may be obtained by melting a dry mix addition of the two materials or by intimately mixing the materials in their molten states. This molten mixture is at a temperature from about 1600F to about 2500F, preferably from about 1800F to about 2400F, and most preferably from about 2000F to about 2200F when sprayed. The molten mixture is sprayed at a pressure from about 10 psi to about 100 psi, preferably from about 15 psi to about 75 psi, and most preferably from about 20 psi to about 50 psi. In a two fluid atomizer spray nozzle, the warm air and the molten ure of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispt on inhibitor flow into the spray nozzle separately un . nth streams exit at the nozzle orifice through different openings. A suitable atomizer spray nozzle is manufactured by Spraying Systems Co., air cap num 122281 60, liquid cap 40100. However, preferred is a concentric pipe twofluid atomizer which consists of an inner pipe carrying the molten mixture within and completely surrounded by a larger diameter pipe carrying the warm air. The air and the liquid flow separately into the same nozzle orifice. The air flows into the nozzle orifice through several openings arranged around one larger opening through which the liquid passes into the nozzle orifice.Multiple nozzle orifice blocks can be used either in a straight line or in a staggered arrangement, with the distance between the blocks approximately equal to 12 inches. The nozzle blocks are welded to the inner liquid pipe and the outer air pipe to hold the structure together and to create a pressurized air chamber for atomization. The advantages of the concentric pipes two fluid atomizer include greater efficiency and convenience of use because of its compactness, ease of mounting, and ease in variation of the spray angle and spray distance. This atomizer also eliminates the need for any separate heat tracing and insulation of the liquid line because the warm air functions as the atomizing agent, the insulator and the heat tracer maintaining the temperature of the molten mixture, and thus results in energy and materials savings.Finally, the concentric pipe two fluid atomizer significantly reduces nozzle clogging and down time, further demonstrating the usefulness of this particular atomizer. Once outside the nozzle orifice, the stream of air breaks up the molten stream of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor into microscopic spherical particles. Generally spherical particles, as used herein, are understood to include particles of a general elliptical nature. These spherical particles begin to freeze before hitting the base granules falling in front of the atomizer nozzle in the mixing drum. The mixinq drum is an almost horizontally mounted, cylindrical, revolving drum with baffles mounted along the axis of the drum to carry the base granules up toward. a vertical position where the granules fall to the bottom of the drum passing through the path of the spray.Most of the granules fall from the baffles into the spray, but some are carried to higher positions where they fall from the baffles onto a protective hood covering the spray nozzle, and then off the front end of the hood in a curtain directly into the path of the spray. The hood functions to prevent any of the granules from being sprayed at a distance too close to the spray nozzle to permit the molten spherical particles to partially solidify before striking the granules, and thus prevents coating of the granules. The hood also protects the spray nozzles from fouling by preventing spray granules from contacting the nozzles.It can be appreciated that the spray distance can be regulated by altering the positioning of the spray nozzle and the protective hood, by varying the length of the hood and the size of the mixing drum, by varying the angular velocity of the mixing drum, and by varying the spray pressures involved. The mixing drum diameter can range from about 1 foot to about 8 feet, but a diameter of 4 feet is preferred and the drum is revolving at about 24 revolutions per minute. The base granules pass in front of the nozzle orifice at a distance from about 6 inches to about 72 inches, preferably from about 6 inches to about 30 inches, more preferably from about 8 inches to about 20 inches, and most preferably from about 10 inches to about 15 inches.The temperature of the base detergent granules is from about 500F to about 1600F, preferably from about 700F to about 1400F, and most preferably from above OF to about 1200F, in order to get proper attachment of the ammo compound dispersion inhibitor mixture on the base granule r ace. The microscopic spherical particles will be partially frozen on hitting and penetrating the base granule surfaces.When partially between molten and frozen states, the spherical particles will hit the base granule surface and attach as distinct particles which are substantially spherical and are not deformed although they impact with sufficient force to partially embed in the detergent granule, yielding optimum characteristics. The spherical particles will be from about 10 microns u to about 500 microns in size, preferably from about 25 microns to about 250 microns in size, and most preferably from about 50 microns to about 200 microns in size, i.e.have diameters in those size ranges. The intimate mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor will have a softening point between about 1000F and about 2000F, preferably between about 1500F and about 1750F, and a solubility in water of about 50 ppm maximum at 250C. Figures 1 and 2 are views of compositions which have been produced by this process. Referring specifically toFigura 1, spherical particles of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor, A, ar partially embedded in are attached to a base detergent granule, B. Figure 2 is a close up view where a spherical particle of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor has been partially embedded in and attached to a base detergent granule, B. The spherical particles must be partially frozen on hitting the base granule surfaces. If the spherical particles are completely frozen, they will bounce off the base granule surfaces if the spherical particles are completely molten, wetting will occur along the base granule surfaces, with the spherical particles losing their distinct character. Wetting results in base detergent granules coated with an insoluble layer of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor mixture, making the granule less soluble. This coating on the base detergent granule tarnishes the base detergent granule with an unattractive, dull, yellow color. Coating is to be avoided. It is surprising that the structure is stable. The spherical particles adhere with sufficient strength to avoid being knocked off despite the relatively small area of contact, despite the fact that they stick out from the surface of the spray dried granule, and despite the fact that no glue is used to improve adherence. The result is a substantially uniform product which does not segregate, allows the detergent to dissolve readily and maintains the integrity of the softener particles in the wash water. The weight percent of intimate mixture of quaternary ammonium compound and organic dispersion inhibitor in the two component system of spray dried granulesandq uarternary ammonium compound organic dispersion inhibitor intimate mixture is from about 3 to about 40 by weight, preferably from about 3 S to about 30 S by weight, and most preferably from about 5 to about 25 by weight. The weight percent of spray dried granules in this particular two component system is from about 97 to about 60 by weight, preferably from about 97 to about 70 by weight, and most preferably from about 95 to about 75 S by weight. The spray dried base granules may optionally be made to incorporate smectite clay, color speckles, sodium tripolyphosphate, detergency builders, bleaching a its and bleach activators, suds boosters or suds suppre , anti tarnish and anti corrosion agents, soil suspending agents, soil release agents, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, pH adjusting agents, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, alkyl polyethoxylate nonionic surfactants, and other optional detergency components, prior to the spraying of the quarternary ammonium compound organic dispersion inhibitor mixture. These optional components may also be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention after the spraying process is completed. The following examples illustrate the compositions and processes of the invention but are not intended to be limiting thereof EXAMPLE I A mixture of 5 parts ditallowdimethylammonium chloride DTDNSC , 1.75 parts tallow alcohol TA , and 0.25 miscellaneou ingredients and water is melted to a temperature from about 210 2300F. This molten mixture of DTDMAC TA is fed through a two fluid atomizer nozzle where it is sprayed at a pressure from about 15 psi to about 75 psi, along with air at a temperature from about 2000F to about 2400F and a pressure from about 40 psi to about 80 psi, onto base detergent granules in a mixing drum. The base detergent granules are passing in front of the atomizer nozzle orifice at a distance of from about 18 inches to about 20 inches, at a temperature of about 1250F. Once outside the spray nozzle orifice, the air breaks up the molten mixture of DTDMAC TA into spherical particles which are partially frozen on contacting the base detergent granules, where they form separate, distinct generally spherical particles partially embedded in and attached to the base granule surfaces. The base detergent granules are then admixed with clay, speckles, and sprayed with perfume and coconut alcohol polyethoxylate EO6 0 The composition produced is as follows Base Detergent Granule Parts Sodium C linear alkyl benzene sulfonaee 12.0 Sodium C14 16 alkyl ethoxyl.0 sulfate 6.0 Sodium silicate 2.0 ratio 12.0 Tallow fatty acid 0.5 Sodium tripolyphosphate 20.7 Brightener 0.29 Sodium sulfate 23.31 Moisture 4.8 TOTAL for base detergent granule 79.6 Admix Per fume 0.15 Coconut alcohol polyethoxylate6 0 0.25 Sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity about 63 meq 100 g, commercially available from Georgia Kaolin Co., USA, under the trade name BROCK 8.00 SDeckles Sodium tripolyphosphate 3.7 Moisture, dextrin glue, and minor components 1.3 5.00 Spray On Mixture Ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride 5.Q0 Tallow alcohol 1.75 Miscellaneous and water 0.25 7.00 TOTAL 100.00 Comparable results are obtained when ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride is substituted or mixed with ditallowdimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, ditallowdimethyl ammonium ethyl sulfate, l methyl l t tallowamido ethyll 2 tallowimidazolinium methyl sulfate.

EXAMPLE III A granular spray on detergent composition was prepared according to the procedure outlined in Example I. The composition produced was as follows Base Detergent Granule Parts Sodium C12 linear alkyl benzene sulfonate 12.0 Sodium C14 16 alkyl ethoxy 1.0 sulfate 6.0 2.0 ratio sodium silicate 12.0 Sodium tripolyphosphate 16.7 Sodium sulfate total crutched 14.3 1.3 Tallow fatty acid 0.5 Coconut alcohol polyethoxylate EO6 0 0.25 Brightener 0.294 Perfume 0.15 Water 4.0 Miscellaneous tower gain 0.8 TOTAL base detergent granule 67.0 Admix Sodium tripolyphosphate STP 4.0 Color speckles sodium tripoly phosphate 5.0 3.7 Sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity about 63 meq 100 g 12.0 Spray On Mixture Ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride DTDMAC 5.00 Tallow alcohol TA 1.75 Miscellaneous and water 0.25 TOTAL spray on mixture 7.00 TOTAL 95.0 This compositional breakdown provides the basis for the next four Compoitins, A, B, C, and D. Initially, about seven pounds of DTDMxc TA mixture was sprayed onto about 67 pounds of base detergent granules.This totaled about 74 pounds of DTDMAC TA spray on plus base detergent granules Composition A . Next, about seven pounds of DTD, SC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 50 pounds of base detergent granules. This particular composition was then admixed with about 17 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules, bringing the total of DTDMAC TA spray on plus base detergent granules up to about 74 pounds Composition B .Finally, about seven pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 30 pounds of base detergent granules. This particular composition was then admixed with about 37 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules, bringing the total of DTD lAC TA spray on plus base detergent granules up to about 74 pounds Composition C . In all three compositions, A, B, and C, the level of DTDMAC TA and base detergent granules totalled to about 74 pounds. Compositions A, B, and C were then admixed with about 4.0 pounds of STP, about 5.0 pounds of color speckles, and about 12 pounds of sodium montmorillonite clay to give finished product compositions. In addition, a control composition was prepared which included DTDMAC TA prills agglomerated together and admixed with base detergent granules. No granules were sprayed withDTDMAC TA mixture. The components of the particular detergent composition were as follows Base Granule Parts Sodium C linear alkylbenzene sulfo 12.0 Sodium fatty alcohol C1 l6 polyethylene oxyde EO1.0 sulfate 6.00 Sodium silicate solids 2.0 ratio 12.0 Sodium tripolyphosphate crutched 16.7Sodium sulfate total crutched 14.3 1.3 parts Tallow fatty acid 0.5Coconut alcohol polyethoxylate E06 0.25Brightener 0.294Water 4.0Miscellaneous tower gain 0.8 Base detergent granules 67.0Color speckles STP 5.0 3.7 parts Subtotal 72.0AdmixSodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity of about 63 meq 100 g, available from Georgia Kaolin Co., USA, under the trade name Brock 12.0AgglomerateSodium tripolyphosphate 4.0Prill Ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride DTDMAC 5.0 Tallow alcohol TA 1.8 Miscellaneous and water 0.2 7.0 7.0Glue mix Dextrin 1.67 Water 3.33 5.0 5.0 Total additive 28.0 TOTAL 100.0 In producing the control composition, about seven pounds of DTDLRC TA prills was admixed with about 67 pounds of base detergent granules, bringing the total of DTDMAC TA prills plus base detergent granules to about 74 pounds. About five pounds of color speckles and about 12 pounds of cla F were then admixed to give the finished product composition of the control. These four compositions were measured on the Cone Index to determine degree of segregation, and for friability and cake grade. Measurements on the Cone Index were taken with and without the 12 pounds sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity of about 63 meq 10og , admixed with CompositionsB and C. Clay was not admixed with Composition A and 12 pounds of clay was included in the control composition. The results of the Cone Index measurements were as follows an explanation of Cone or Coning Index measurement is contained in Example VII Cone Index Degree of Segregation Cone Index Cone Index Composition With Clay Without Clay A 8.7 B 14.0 10.7 C 11.3 5.8 control 40.8 contains 7 pounds agglomerated prills of DTDMAC TA 67 pounds base detergent granule The results indicate an overall low degree of segregation, and especially favorable results when compared with the control performance. These results are surprising, considering the structure, and indicate the strength of the bond between the DTD AC TA particles and the base detergent granule. Friability measurements were taken for just the sprayedon base granules of Compositions A, B, and C, and in addition, for base detergent granules alone, without any spray on, admits agglomerate, or other additives included CompositionD . The composition of these base detcrgent granules was the same as base detergent granules sprayed with DTDASC TA mixture. To determine the friability, a finite weight of granular detergent compositions is shaken and shifted through 20 mesh, 28 mesh, and 100 mesh Tyler sieves respectively. The weight percent of original sample passing through the 100 mesh Tyler sieve is determined as follows total weight weight retained on 20 mesh sieve weight retained on 28mesh sieve weight retained on 100 mesh sieve . total weight 100. The entire sample is then combined and placed in an attrition apparatus where air is allowed to blow through the sple, while all dust, granules, and particles of the sample are contained within. The entire sample is then removed from the attrition apparatus, reweighed, and again sifted through 20 mesh, 28 mesh, and 100 mesh Tyler sieves respectively. The weight percent of sample passing through the 100 mesh Tyler sieve after attrition is calculated in the sane manner as for the original sample. Now the difference between the weight percent of sample passing through the 100 mesh Tyler sieve after attrition, and the weight percent of original sample passing through the 100 mesh Tyler sieve, is the measure of friability of the sample. The larger the difference, the greater the friability. The friability is a measure of the dust generated during agitation, i.e. the tendency of a particular detergent granule to crumble during handling. Cake grade measurements were taken for Compositions A, B, and C, and for the control composition, all on a finished product basis. To determine cake grade, a sample of detergent composition is compressed under a 20 lb. weight for one minute, forming a cake . This cake sample is then placed under a mechanical force gauge a suitable gauge is a Heuba Spring mechanical force gauge, manufactured by Ametek , and force is applied to break the cake. The pounds force needed to break a cake of the sample is recorded as a measure of the cake grade of the sample. The larger the amount of pounds force needed to be applied, the larger the cake grade reading.A relatively low cake grade, i.e., little force needed to break a cake of sample, is indicative of good flow and good storage characteristics of a detergent sample. A relatively high cake grade indicates poor flow and poor storage characteristics of a detergent product. Friability measurements were not taken for the control composition and cake grade measurements were not taken forComposition D. The results of the friability and cake grade measurements were as follows Finished Product Composition Friability Cake Grade A 30.5 4.2 t B 25.2 4.0 C 27.9 4.6 D D base deter 29.9 gent granules alone control 4.7 sontains 7 pounds agglomerated prills DTDMAC TA 6 pounds base detergent granule The results indicate that base detergent granules with spray on mixture of DTDi lAC TA have at least a comparable degree of friability as base detergent granules without spray on, which is surprising in view of the structure. If anything, one would have expected greater friability. Measurements also indicate a slightly improved cake grade of the sprayed on base detergent granules as compared to the control composition. This also is surprising since one would expect the DTDMAC TA particles to increase caking, if anything. EXAMPLE IV About seven pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 82 pounds of the base detergent granule as disclosed in Example II Composition A . About seven pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was also sprayed onto about 55 pounds of base detergent granule, and further admixed with about 27 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules, bringing the total of DTDMAC TA spray on plus base detergent granules up to about 89 pounds Composition B . Next, about seven pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 30 pounds of base detergent granules, and then admixed with about 52 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules, bringing the total of DTDMAC TA spray on plus base detergent granules up to about 89 pounds Composition C .The compositional breakdown of the base detergent granules and the DTDMAC TA mixture was identical with Example II for all three compositions, A, B and C. Compositions A, B, and C were then admixed with about 3.0 pounds of color speckles, about 8.0 pounds of sodium montmorillonite clay, and sprayed with about 0.15 pounds of perfume. In addition, the 82 parts of base detergent granule were also sprayed with 8.4 parts of DTDlclAC TA mixture 6.0 parts DTDMAc, 2.2 parts TA, 0.2 parts miscellaneous and water to give a composition as follows Base Detergent Granule Parts Sodium C linear alkyl benzene sulfonaee 12.0 Sodiumalkyl C14 16 ethoxy EO10 sulfate 6.0 Sodium silicate 2.0 ratio 12.0 Sodium aluminosilicate hydrated Zeolite A, particle diameter 1 10P 20.0 Tallow fatty acid 0.5 Sodium sulfosuccinate 2.0 Brightener 0.29 Sodium sulfate 21.66 Moisture 7.4 TOTAL base detergent granule 81.85 Perfume 0.15 Speckles spray dried anionic detergent granules agglomerated with dyed polyethylene glycol 6000 3.00 Sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity about 63 meq l00 g, commercially available from Georgia Kaolin Co., USA, under the trade name BROCK 8.00 Spray on Mixture Ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride 6.00 Tallow alcohol 2.20 Miscellaneous and water 0.20 8.40 TOTAL 101.40 This compositional breakdown provides the basis for the next four compositions, D, E, F, and G. About 8.4 pounds of DTD.NSC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 82 pounds of base detergent granules in this fashion Composition D .Additionally, about 8.4 pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 55 pounds of base detergent granules, and then admixed with 27 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules CompositionE . About 8.4 pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was further sprayed onto about 30 pounds of base detergent granules and admixed with about 52 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules Composition F . Also, about 8.4 pounds of DTDMACTA mixture was sprayed onto about 82 pounds of base detergent granules, and admixed with about one pound of zeosyl 110 Composition G . Compositions D, E, F, and G were each admixed with about 3.0 pounds of color speckles, about 8.0 pounds of sodium montmorillonite clay, and sprayed with about 0.15 pounds of perfume. A control composition was prepared comprising prills ofDTDMAC TA agglomerated with sodium sulfate and then admixed with clay and base detergent granules. The composition of the control was approximately as follows Base Detergent Granule Parts Sodium Cl linear alkyl benzene Suucnate 12.0 sodium C14 16 alkyl ethoxy1.0 6.0 Sodium sulfosuccinate hydrated Zeolite A, particle diameter 1 10 , 2.0 Sodium silicate 2.0 ratio 12.0 Sodium sulfate 15.8 Brightener 0.29 Tallow fatty acid 0.5 Sodium aluminosilicate 20.0 Coconut alcohol polyethoxylate EO6 0 0.25 Perfume 0.15 TOTAL base detergent granule 68.99 Speckles spray dried anionic detergent granules agglomerated with dyed polyethylene glycol 6000 3.00 Sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity about 63 meq 100 g 8.00 Moisture water and miscellaneous 4.00 Agglomerate Prill Ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride 6.0 Tallow alcohol 2.2 Miscellaneous and water 0.2 8.4 Sodium sulfate 4.0 Glue Mix Dextrin 1.2 Water 2.4 3.6 TOTAL agglomerate 16.0 TOTAL PARTS 99.9About 8.4 pounds of DTDMAC TA prills were agglomerated with about 4.0 pounds of sodium sulfate and about 3.6 pounds of glue mix, and then admixed with about 3.0 pounds of speckles, about 8.0 pounds of sodium montmorillonite clay, and about 69 pounds of base detergent granules to produce the control composition. The respective compositions were measured for bright percent DTDMAC on a colorimeter. It is not known why the weight percent DTD.sUC would differ from sample to sample but it nevertheless differs. A series of fabrics were washed in these respective compositions, including the control composition, under ordinary wash water conditions about 1250F for the voltage and static cling runs and about 700F for the insolubles grade run and then dried under ordinary machine drying conditions. The fabrics were then measured for average volts per square yard, number of clings, and insolubles grade. Dew point temperature of the room around the machine dryer was measured in OF for each test run.Four test runs of the control composition were taken. Aftcr washing, the respective fabrics were graded for insolubles while still wet. Observations of at least two graders were recorded on a scale of one to five half grades may be used . The garments or fabrics were observed by the graders on the outside, inside, front and back for insolubles.The lower the number, the more insolubles are observed on a particular fabric. Therefore, a higher insolubles grade is indicative of good solubility of a particular detergent composition, while a lower insolubles grade indicates poorer solubility of a particular detergent composition. The results of these tests under ordinary wash water ard machine drying conditions were as follows Weight Percent Average Number Dew Point in InsolublesComposition DTDMAC Analyzed Volts Sq.

At higher dew point temperatures, greater static control will be observed.Test runs of spray on detergent composition vs. the control may be compared at comparable dew points in the room around the machine dryer. From the results, it can be seen that at comparable dew points, the fabrics washed in the spray on detergent compositions registered less average voltage and less instances of cling than fabrics washed in the control composition. In fact, except for one particular test run, the spray on detergent compositions demonstrated overall good static control. The one exception, the Composition D test run, may be explained by the lower level of DTDMAC 4.3 by weight analyzed in that composition. When one compares the level of DTDMAC analyzed in the spray on compositions and the control compositions, it can be seen that the spray on detergent compositions accomplish a better level of static control with less DTD 1AC analyzed.This is surprising, as there seems to be no logical reason for this result. The insolubles grading for fabrics washed in the spray on compositions was as good. if not better than the average insolubles grade for fabrics washed in the control composition. EXAMPLE V The granular detergent composition of Example II 7 part spray on mixture DTDMAC TA 82 parts base detergent granules was prepared according to the procedure outlined in Example by spraying about 7 pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture onto about 82 pounds of base detergent granules and then admixing with about 3.0 pounds of color speckles, about S.0 pounds of sodium montmorillonite clay, and spraying with about 0.15 pounds of perfume. Two separate compositions,Composition A and Composition B, were prepared in this manner. In addition, about 7 pounds of DTDMAC TA mixture was sprayed onto about 55 pounds of base detergent granules, and admixed with about 27 pounds of unsprayed base detergent granules Composition C .Composition C was admixed with about 8.0 pounds of sodium montmorillonite clay, about 3.0 pounds of speckles, and sprayed with about 0.15 pounds of perfume. A series of fabrics were washed in three separate wash water solutions of Composition A, and Composition B, andComposition C under ordinary wash water conditions about 1250F for the voltage and static cling runs and about 700F for the insolubles grade run and then dried under ordinar machine drying conditions. The fabrics were then measured for average volts per square yard, number of clings, and insolubles grade as in Example IV. The respective compositions were measured for weight percent DTDMAC on a colorimeter.It is not known why the weight percent DTDMAC differs from sample to sample, but it nevertheless differs. Dew point temperature in OF was measured in the room surrounding the machine dryer for each test run. The results of these tests were as follows Weight Percent Average Number Dew Point in InsolublesComposition DTDMAC Analyzed Volts Sq.

No instances of cling between washed fabrics were noted. The disparity in average volts per square yard reading may be explained as corresponding to the level of DTDMAC measured in each of the compositions. The insolubles grade, on a scale of five, was favorable for all three samples. EXEMPLE VIApproximately 8.4 lbs. of an intimitate mixture of ditallcdimethyl ammonium chloride DTDMAC and tallow alcohol TA is method in a spray tank to a temperature from about 210 F to about 230 F. The composition of the interate mixture comprices approximately 0.0 parts DTDMAC, 2,00 parts tallow alcohol, and 0.40 parts miscollaneous and water. The molten DTDMAC TA mixture is then fed into a spray arm which contains four two fluid atomizer nozzle at the end of air lines and molten DTDMAC TA lines.Air at about 55 psi. and about 2200F to about 250 F is fed to the spray nozzles in the spray arm. The spray arm is connected to a mixing drum which contains about 82 Ibs. of spray dried base detergent granules of the following composition Base Detergent Granule Parts Sodium C12 linear alkyl benzene sulfonate 12.0 Sodium C14 16 alkyl ethoxy 1.0 sulfate 6.0 Sodium silicate 2.0 ratio 12.0 Sodium aluminosilicate hydrated Zeolite A, 1 10 20.0 Tallow fatty acid 0.5 Sodium sulfosuccinate 2.0 Brightener 0.29 Sodium sulfate 21.66 Moisture 7.4 TOTAL base detergent granule 81.85 The mixing drum is approximately 5 ft. by 2 1 2 ft. in diameter with eight three inch baffles. The mixing drum is revolving at about 10 revolutions per minute rpm to provide a continuous curtain of base granules passing in front of the spray nozzles. The base detergent granules temperature is from about 1000F to about 1100F. The molten mixture of DTDMAC TA is pumped into the spray nozzles inside the mixing drum at 20 psi. pressure where it is atomized into spherical droplets by the air and sprayed onto the base detergent granules. The spray distance from the nozzle orifice to the base detergent granules is from about 8 inches to about 12 inches. Approximately five minutes are required to spray about 8.4 lbs. of moltenDTDMAC TA mixture onto about 82 lbs. of base detergent granules. The sprayed detergent granules are then unloaded from the mixing drum and screened through a 12 mesh Tyler sieve.Approximately 8.0 parts or pounds sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity about 63 meq lOOg and about 3.0 parts or pounds speckles spray dried anionic detergent granules agglomerated with dyed polyethylene glycol 6000 are admixed, and the resulting admixture sprayed with about 0.15 parts or pounds perfume to make a finished product.A small amount about one part or pound of 1 zeosyl 110 is optionally added to improve free flow characteristics.This all totals to about 102.4 parts or pounds. EXEMPLE VII The Cone or Coning Index is a measure of segregation of detergent granules. Equipment used to determine the ConingIndex includes two funnels or cones, one vertically above the other in the same position, with a distance of about 10 inches between the bottom of the top cone and the top of the bottom cone. Approximately 100 grams of finished product is mixed thoroughly and poured into the top funnel. The finished product flows down into the lower funnel, and then flows into four separate beakers, each beaker collecting about 25 grams of product. Each of the four samples in the four beakers is then analyzed for percent DTDMAC by weight . The Coning Index formula is a fraction, the numerator being the difference between the highest and lowest weight percent DTDMAC analyzed over the four samples t and the denominator being the average weight percent DTDMAC over the four samples taken. This fractional reading is then multiplied by 100 to give the Coning Index. The detergent composition prepared in Example VI was run through the Coning Index procedure, and four samples taken. The weight percent DTDMAC in each of the four samples was analyzed to be 6.27 , 5.82 , 6.04 , and 6.46 respectively.The average weight percent DTDMAC over these four samples was 6.148 DTDMAC. Applying the formula described above for determining the Coning Index, the calculation is as follows 100 10.4 Coning Index for the compoition prepared in Example VI This is compared to a Coning Index of 40.8 for the following composition where DTDMAC TA prills were agglomerated together and admixed with base detergent granules, but not sprayed onto base detergent granules Base Granule Parts Sodium C linear alkylbenzene 12.0 sulfonie Sodium fatty alcohol C 16 polyethylene oxide y ethoxylate EO1.0 sulfate 6.0 Sodium silicate solids 2.0 ratio 12.0 Sodium tripolyphosphate crutched 16.7 Sodium sulfate total crutched 14.3 1.3 parts Tallow fatty acid 0.5 Coconut alcohol polyethoxylate EO6 0.25 Brightener 0.294 Water 4.0 Miscellaneous tower gain 0.8 Base Detergent Granules 67.0 Color speckles STP 5.0 parts 3.7 parts Subtotal 72.0 Admix Sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity of about 63 meq 100 g, available from Georgia Kaolin Co., USA, under trade name Brock 12.0 AGGLOMERATE Sodium tripolyphosphate 4.0Pill Ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride DTOMAC 5.0 Tallow alcohol TA 1.8 Miscellaneous b water 0.2 7.n 7.0Glue n3x Dextrin 1.67 Water 3.33 5.0 5.0 Total additive 28.0 TOTAL 100.0 The Cone Index is. a measure of the degree of segregation of detergent granules, the higher the Cone Index, the greater the segregation. Therefore, on the basis of this measurement, the composition produced in Example VI has almost one quarter the degree of segregation that the conventional detergent composition has, where prills of DTDMAC TA are agglomerated and admixed together with base detergent granules. This is surprising, since the agglomerates approximate the size and density of the base granules. EXAMPLE VIII The composition disclosed in Example II was prepared according to the method disclosed in Example II, except that the base granule temperature was about 180 E at the time of the spraying of intimate DTDMAC TA mixture onto the base granules. The composition disclosed in Example I was also prepared according to the procedure outlined in Example I, with base granules at temperatures of about 800F and about 1250F respectively, when sprayed with intimate DTDMAC TA mixture.The base detergent granules of Example II and Example I were then compared for spray on characteristics. It should be noted that actual chemical composition of the base detergent granules do not affect the spray on characteristics observed herein. The base detergent granules sprayed at 1800F were observed to be completely coated around the base granule surfaces by intimate DTDMAC TA mixture. This tarnished the base detergent granules with an unattractive, slightly yellowish color. Since the DTDMAC TA intimate mixture is almost entirely water insoluble, coating increased the amount of insolubles found on fabrics washed with those base detergent granules. A 2.4 insolubles grade was recorded for fabrics washed with these detergent compositions. The base detergent granules sprayed at 809F and 1250F were found to contain finite spherical particles of DTDMACTA mixture attached to the surfaces of the base detergent granules. No continuous coating of the base detergent granule with DTDMAC TA mixture occurred. Granules sprayed at 800F and 1250F were more soluble, registering an insolubles grade of 2.7 for fabrics washed in the detergent compositions sprayed at 8G F. These granules sprayed at 800F and 1250F were the same color as unsprayed base granules, indicating that the spherical particles of DTDMAC TA were not visible to the eye. This base granule appearance is more attractive than the appearance when the granules are coated with DTDMACTA mixture.At the same time, the base detergent granules sprayed at 800F and 1250F were crisper than the base detergent granules sprayed at 1800F. Next, the characteristics of the base detergent granules sprayed at 800F and 1259F were compared against each other.Overall characteristics for both were good, except that the base detergent granules sprayed at 1250F were observed to have a larger number of DTDMAC TA spherical particles attached to the base granule surfaces. The DTDMAC TA spherical particles were also observed to be smaller in size. This means that the spherical particles of DTDMAC TA are less likely to chip off the base detergent granule surfaces because they are smaller and more numerous. The base detergent granules sprayed at i250F were observed to be crisper than the base detergent granules sprayed at 800F, although both compositions had crisp granules. Thus, this example demonstrates the criticality of the preferred ranges of the base granule temperature in achieving the formation of unique detergent compatible antistatic compositions containing the quaternary ammonium organic dispersion inhibitor particles attached to, but not coating, the detergent base granules EXAMPLE IX A granular spray on detergent composition was prepared according to the procedure outlined in Example II. Base detergent granules were sprayed with DTDMAC TA mixture, then admixed with speckles and clay and sprayed with perfume.

This molten mixture is fed through a concentric pipe two fluid atomizer nozzle as previously described herein, where it is sprayed at a pressure of from about 20 psi to about 50 psi, along with air at a temperature from about 2200F to about 2500F and a pressure from about 80 psi to about 110 psi, onto base detergent granules in a mixing drum.The base detergent granules fall from the baffles into the path of the spray, and some of the granules fall from the baffles near the top of the mixing drum onto a protective hood covering the atomizer nozzle and then fall off the front end of the hood in a curtain into the path of the spray. The base detergent granules are passing in front of the atomizer nozzle orifice at a distance of from about 10 inches to about 15 inches, at a temperature from about 800F to about 1200F. Once outside the spray nozzle orifice, the air breaks up the molten mixture of DTDMAC TA into spherical particles which are partially frozen on contacting the base detergent granules, where they form separate, distinct generally spherical particles partially embedded in and attached to the base granule surfaces. The base detergent granules are then admixed with clay, speckles, and sprayed with perfume and coconut alcohol polyethoxylate EO60 .

EXAMPLE XI A molten intimate mixture of DTDMAC and tallow alcohol was sprayed along with air through a concentric pipe twofluid atomizer as previously described herein onto base detergent granules at a temperature from about 800F to about 1200F and at a spray distance from about 10 inches to about 15 inches. Samples A, B, C and D were produced by spraying the molten mixture and the air at different temperature and pressure conditions. The spray on particle size was measured for each sample. An insolubles grade was assigned to each sample as previously described herein in Example IV. The composition of each of the samples formed was as follows Base Detergent Granule PartsSodium C 2 linear alkyl benzene sulfona 18.0 Sodium silicate 1.6 ratio 7.0Sodium aluminosilicate hydrated Zeolite A, particle diameter l IOu 20.0Sodium carbonate 10.0Sodium sulfate 14.1Aluminium sulfate 0.3Sodium acetate 5.0Coconut alcohol polyethoxylate E06.0 0.25Brightener 0.15Moisture 6.0 TOTAL base detergent granule 80.8 Perfume 0.15Speckles spray dried anionic detergent granules agglomerated with dyed polyethylene glycol 6000 3.00Sodium montmorillonite clay ion exchange capacity about 63 meq 100 g, commercially available from Georgia Kaolin Co., USA, under the trade name BRoCK 8.00Spray on MixtureDitallowdimethyl ammonium chloride 5.75Tallow alcohol 2.01Miscellaneous and water 0.29 8.05 TOTAL 100.00The results were as follows Spray Pressure. psi Spray Temperature, F Particle Size Distribution Insolubles Grade Air Molten Mixture Air Molten Mixture Spray on ParticleSAMPLE 90 MEAN 10 A 25 50 220 218 95 300 400 2.0 B 52 50 219 218 75 290 400 1.9 C 106 50 225 226 50 145 340 2.3 D 100 20 214 229 55 110 270 2.4 This example demonstrates that spraying at temperatures and pressures within the preferred ranges produces spray on particles within the preferred size range ha ing superior solubility as evidenced by the higher insolubles grades of samples C and D.Criticality of the spray pressure of the air is shown in that when the air is sprayed at a pressure lower than the preferred range, larger spray on particles than those preferred are produced. These larger particles tend to bounce off the base detergent granule instead of attaching to it because, being sprayed at a lower pressure, they have a longer time to solidify before reaching the detergent granules and, even if they should become attached, they tend to chip off the base detergent granule surfaces because they are larger and fewer in number. In either event, the large particles result in solubility grades which, while they are satisfactory for a detergent composition, are significantly poorer than those obtained using the preferred ranges, as evidenced by the lower insolubles grades of samples A and B. It can be appreciated that all the conditions of spraying similarly affect the spray on characteristics of the product and that the spray conditions disclosed are critical for the formation of proper attachment of the spray on particles.
