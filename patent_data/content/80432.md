# Coaxial cable connector and plug, contact wedge and wedge nut ferrule sub assemblies for a coaxial cable connector.

## Abstract
The coaxial cable connector is constituted by a wedge nut sub assembly comprising a wedge nut 88 and inner ferrule 80 , a plug sub assembly comprising a body 58 , an outer contact 52 and an insulator 60 , and a contact wedge sub assembly comprising a wedge 68 , an insulator 70 and a cen ter contact 74 . When said sub assemblies are assembled for securing a coaxial cable in the connector, the inner ferrule 80 expands in a way to bear against the inner surface of the wedge nut 88 , thus providing a barrier to moisture entering the connector from the rear end thereof. Further the sub assemblies are designed in a way to achieve significant economies cost of manufacture of the con nector without degrading its electrical and structural charac teristics.
