# BONE EVALUATION METHOD

## Abstract
A method for evaluating bone comprising the steps of a determining a bone pattern i by measuring the photodensity of an X ray photograph from the long shank bone of a limb or ii by photon absorption metory from the long shank bone of a limb b smoothing and symmetrizing the bone pattern to modify the same c determining at least one index selected from the group consisting of an index of the bone cortical width MCI , a bone width D , a maximum bone density GSmax , a minimum bone density GSmin , a bone mineral content ΣGS , and an average bone density ΣGS D or ΣGS D² and d evaluating the bone based on the at least one index. The bone evaluation also can be carried out by deter mining a bone density distribution, from the modified bone pattern obtained above, by setting a bone model having an elliptic bone cross sectional external shape, a zonate bone cortex, and a bone density decreasing portion in the inside of the bone cortex. The bone evaluation can further be carried out by first obtaining modified patterns in a plurality of por tions of the bone at a constant distance and, then, by deter mining a bone density distribution in each portion from the modified bone pattern in each portion by setting the above mentioned bone model in each portion. The bone density distribution in each portion is classified, by color, based on the density values, and the X ray image or photon absorption metory image is converted to the image of the bone density distribution.
