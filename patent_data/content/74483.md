# Original document feed system for a copier.

## Abstract
A copier document feed system includes a document stack tray 208 positioned over an exposure platen feed system 210 . A document from the stack is fed to the platen feed system by a first turnaround system 214, 212 . After exposure the document is fed to a deflector 218 to either the top duplex path or to the bottom simplex path of a second turnaround system 224, 222 or to a further tray SADF path . When the document is fed to the bottom of the second turnaround system, this system drives it round back to the document stack tray. When the document is fed to the top of the second turnaround system, the feed direction of this sytem is reversed to feed the document, inverted, back to the exposure platen. The exposure platen feed system, and first and second turnaround systems are each driven by a separate servo system 254 260, and 248 .
