## Description
Title Gas cooker The invention relates to a gas cooker comprising a gas jet and a detachable or non detachable pan supporting member in the vicinity thereof and cooperating therewith, and having one or more through apertures therein which permit a direct contact of the gas flame with the bottom side of the pan to be put on. In known gas cookers, such as domestic gas rings or cookingranges, the pan supporting members may have various forms. Generally speaking, the prior pan supporting members are designed and dimensioned so that pans may be positioned over the gas jets for them to be stably supported and well centred. Moreover, the construction is selected to be as open as possible, i.e. the aim is for the supply of air to the gas combustion zone around the gas jet and for the removal of the combustion gases from this zone to be obstructed as little as possible. Taking the above desirable properties of the pan supporting members into account, these may also be combined with loose pan supporting elements often purporting to avoid a direct contact of the gas flame with the pan bottom, while retaining the freedom of gas transport into and out of the gas combustion zone around the gas jet. It is evident that, in prior pan supporting members, attention has been paid one sidedly to the pan supporting, centering and flame distributing functions thereof, without regard to an optimum use of the heat that becomes available during the combustion. Practice has shown that the combustion gases ascending around the pans and flowing to the chimney still have a considerable heat content. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to achieve an improved useful effect of the heat that becomes available during the combustion of gas in a gas cooker. For this purpose, according to the invention, there is provided a gas cooker of the kind defined in the opening paragraph hereof, which is characterized in that said one or more apertures of the pan supporting member are sealable in cooperation with at least the pan bottom the pan supporting member is peripherally provided with a rim arranged to cooperate with the pan bottom to form a gas combustion space that is in open ,closable or non closable communication with the atmosphere, and is arranged to be coupled by means of a connecting channel to at least a second1 riwm d, pan supporting member which at the pan supporting side is also of an open structure sealable in cooperation with at least the pan bQttnC, therm to provide, together with the rim, an enclosed space communicatiing with said connecting channel, said second pan supporting member having one or more closable or non closable vent apertures connected with the atmosphere. According to the invention the gas jet concerned and the pan supporting member associated therewith together form a master combustion zone, to which one or more heating spaces can be connected. Thus, for example, it has been found that, in a standard gas fired cooking range for d estic purposes with 4 gas jets, i.e. 4 sources of heat, while retaining 4 sources of heat, these may also be composed, according to the invention1 from one of the gas jets with the corresponding pan supporting member as the master combustion zone, to which are connected the second and a third combustion space and also a fourth combustion space connected to the second and third combustion spaces.Surprisingly it has been found that when the four sources of heat of such a cookingrange modified in accordance with the invention for cooking purposes, a saving in gas consumption of approximRtely 50 can be achieved without unduly prolonging the cooking time. According to one embodiment of the invention, to which embodiment the invention also relates, in a standard gas cooker, e.g. a 4 jet cookingrange, one gas jet may be assembled by the manufacturer to the master conbustion zone at a fixed part of the apparatus, supplying the other combustion spaces a5 loose individual elements to be connected in accordance with the invention, to each other and to the master fire, or as an integral accessory already assembled to a structual unit and to be connected to the master Combustion zone.On the other hand, in one embodiment to which the invention accordingly also relates, it is possible for the pan supporting member which together with the gas jet forms the master combustion zone to be supplied as a loose element beside the other elements serving as a source of heat, or in the form of an integral accessory forming a structual unit. The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the drawings, which, by way of example, show one embodiment of a detach able integral accessory to be placed on a 4 jet gas cooker to form, in combination with one gas jet, a master combustion zone and three other heating sources adjacent to the other three gas jets of the gas cooker, which are not to be ignited. In said drawings Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows the accessory in plan view Fig. 2 shows the accessory in side elevational view, taken on the line II II of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows the accessory in side elevational view, taken on the line III III of Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 diagrammatically shows a survey of the possible embodiments of the integral accessory or the corresponding diagram of connections within the framework of the integral accessory shown in Fig. 1. Referring to the drawings, the accessory designated by 1 comprises the pan supporting member 2 which, provided with a rim 23, together with the gas jet 6 forms the master combustion zone 7, and further the pansupporting members 3, 4 and 5, which together with their respective rims 33 form the respective heating spaces 8, 9 and 10. These heating spaces 8, 9 and 10 are internally provided with cruciform gas stream conducting channels 27, 28 and 29, which are closed at the bottom. The master combustion zone 7 and the heating spaces 8, 9 and 10 are interconnected by means of connecting channels 11, 12, 13, 14, of which channels, 12, 13 and 14 are provided with butterfly valves 15, 16 and 17, with which the corresponding channel passageways can be closed. The connecting channels 11, 12, 13, 14 are formed in twoparts which are telescopic for adjustment of the correct desired spacing between the master combustion zone and the heating spaces. Once the desired spacing has been adjusted, it can be fixed by means of clamps 18, 19, 20, 21. Connecting channel 11 is non closable, so that the combustion gases formed in the master combustion zone 7 are assured of a way of escape to the atmosphere, for which purpose combustion space 8 is additionally provided with closable apertures, not shown, venting to the atmosphere in order that combustion gases may escape to the atmosphere even if a pan is placed on heating space 8 and connecting channels 12 and 14 are closed. The use and operation of the accessory are as follows. The accessory is placed upon the gas cooker by means of fasteners 22. when gas jet 6 is ignited and the master combustion zone 7 is sealed by placing a pan or kettle on the pan supporting member 7, the pan or kettle is partly heated by direct flame contact, while hot combustion gases flow via the contesting channels 11 and 12 to the heating spaces 8 and 9, and possibly through connecting channels 13 and 14 further to heating source 10 in accordance with arrows P. There is a possibility of taking heating sources 9 and 10 of the system of f strewa by closing connecting channels 14 and 15. Fig. 4 shows other possible variants of connections. Naturally, the apparatus as described above and shown in the drawings can be edified without departing from the scope of the invention. Tints, for exanle, heating sources 9 and 10 may be provided with a circular plate 24 and rings 25, 26, which can be separately removed in succession, whereby the open top of the heating sources 9 and 10 can be increased or decreased in area as desired,or can even be closed. It is also possible, according to the invention, within a circuit of a master cbustion zone and one or more other heating spaces connected to it, in addition to the master combustion zone to make another heating space suitable for use as a combustion zone in combination with a gas jet. Furthermore, within heating spaces 8, 9, 10, the gas current conducting channels may be omitted leaving the bottom side of said spaces fully open. This greatly simplifies the construction of the heating spaces, which is advantageous as far as cost is concerned.
