# METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INJECTING A KILL GAS INTO A GAS PHASE CATALYTIC POLYMERIZATION REACTOR

## Abstract
In a method for terminating a gas phase olefin polymeriza tion reaction with a kill gas such as carbonmonoxide or carbon dioxide, a carrier gas is used to increase the rate of penetration of kill gas into the reaction medium.
