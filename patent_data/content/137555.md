# Method of manufacturing a light emitting device.

## Abstract
On a support 1 which supports a light emitting semi conductor device 5 there is arranged a cap 19 which is hermetically sealed to the support. In the cap 19 there is provided a transparent plate 23 , an inner layer 31 of which facing the semiconductor device 5 consists of a material having a high refractive index 1.7 . On the outer side of the plate 23 there is provided a layer of photosensitive lacquer 25 which is exposed to the light emitted by the semiconduc tor device 5 . After development of the layer of lacquer, only the exposed part 35 which is situated opposite the semicon ductor device remains. This part is heated to the melting point, thus forming a droplet of lacquer 37 , after which the outer layer of the plate 23 and the droplet of lacquer are removed by way of a non selective etching method, so that a lens 39 which is situated opposite the semiconductor device 5 and a flat window 41 which surrounds the lens are automatically formed at the same time.
