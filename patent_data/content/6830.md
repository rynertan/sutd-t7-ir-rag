## Description
Plastic well screen and its connection systemThis invention relates to a well screen and its connection system.In this invention the well screen made of plastic is used to filter the water in the wells and collect the ground water. Connection system will facilitate the pipe connection and disconnection.Known in the prior art in the deep wells and pipes made of steel, closed and screened are used.The weight of the steel pipes are however changeable depending on their diameter and length, still the density of 3 the pipes being 7,8 kg dm3 creates problems in transport and their attachment. pipes are connected by welding, when it is required to disconnect it is necessary to cut the pipes from welded points. These processes are accomplished with a diesel generator set and it is time consuming.However, the wells opened by drilling rods are easily collapsible so attachment of the pipes must be carried out quickly. In the screened pipes, the screen openings are prepared either when material is flat or made up to pipe.The screen openings prepared on the flat plate will close at the inside and open at the outside while the production of pipe. In this way the opening will be wide at the outside and narrow inside. The openings prepared on pipe will have parallel two surfaces. On the other hand, the opening width will depend on the thickness of cutting tools and will have certain value.Whichever production system of the above method is used, the sand particles coming with water will stick to the openings and in time will reduce the screening area and sometimes in sandy places will result in complete clogging of the openings.The mineral salts present in the water will also in time result in clogging of the openings.It is well known that that the iron material is effected by the acidic or basic soils. The acidic or basic media effected on iron material results in corrosion. On the other hand the pipe being in contact with water continuously at the inside certainly will result in corrosion.For this reason the working life of steel pipes are known to be lo to 15 years. At the end of this life or the collapse of the well for the same reason, it is necessary to open a new well and equip it with pipe. In the steel pipes, the total screen area proportion to total pipe surface area is generally remains to a low value, such as at 20 .The closed pipes or well screened pipes made of plastic are light because of the low density and it is easy to transport and attach to each other.As seen in the Figure 2, the connection of the pipes are realised by peripherical 6 bolts. These bolts are thick and specially threaded and conical. The connection of the pipes are realised with the easy advance of the bolts into the holes on the pipes. To disconnect the pipes, the bolts are removed. This process does not need a speciality and is carried out in a short time so the pipes are put into place in deep wells long before any collapse occurs in the well walls.The pipes with plastic screens are formed by connecting the element shown in Figure 1. This element being made by molding the surfaces are smooth and they are all similar.Screen openings width are 1 or 2 or 3 mm at the outside and 3 or 4 or 5 mm at the inside are in V shape and different dimensions. That is the narrow end of the opening is at the outside of the pipe. In this type of opening, when the sand comes with water passes the opening being wide inside falls into the pipe and without clogging goes into the well.So the screen openings will never clog with the sand particles.On the other hand, the production of openings with different dimensions will facilitate a choice for use with different sand particles on the well.In this type of well screen having smooth surfaces and generally being durable to acidic and basic media, the chemical substances will not accumulate around the openings and so will cause clogging of the screens.This property and not oxidizing properties of plastics will result a long life of the pipes in the soil. Theoretically they have infinite working life although in calculations the working life has been taken 50 years. As it seen it has three times the life of the steel pipes.In this type of well screen the proportion of the total opening surface area to total surface area is proportional of the opening width, but it is minimum 2C . For this reason it is possible to filter more water than prior art.As it seen in the figures, the pipes is made up by putting the screens on top of each other. It is possible to make a pipe in required length by replacing the screen elements on three rods passing through the three holes arranged peripherially. The main object of this invention is to provide a well screen element and its connection system, easily and quickly connectable and disconnectable with larger screening surface area and with longer life.Explanation of the Figures 1 V shaped screen opening widening from outside towards inside so preventing the clogging.2 Well screen is formed by elements. Connection is made by three rods passing through three holes.3 A ring, to provide the centering of pipe connection and being on each element.4 A bolt which is used as guide in connecting the screens.5 An opening which is opened on the male end of the pipe where the guide bolt goes through.6 Periphery placed six bolts used for connection.7 Screen element 8 Screen connection 9 Screen bottom piece lo Casing pipe
