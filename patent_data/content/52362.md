# Fast start up system for transversal equalizers.

## Abstract
A fast start up system for a transversal equalizer com prising means provided in a transmitter for generating a periodic symbol sequence with a period L, the auto correla tion function of said sequence being completely 0 except for its center means for generating and transmitting a test signal based upon said generated symbol sequence means provided in a receiver for generating the same periodic symbol sequence as that generated in the transmitter in a proper phase relation thereto according to a received signal means for calculating the correlation between L sampled values obtained by sampling the received test signal at the symbol interval and a sequence obtained by recirculating said periodic symbol sequence for each of consecutive M shifted phases means for calculating the correlation be tween L sampled values obtained by sampling the received test signal at the symbol interval with a phase differring from the phase of said first mentioned sampled values by an amount corresponding to one half of the symbol interval and a sequence obtained by recirculating said periodic symbol sequence for each of M consecutive shifted phases means for multiplying said calculated M M correlation values by a constant means for obtaining discrete Fourier transform of the M M multiplied correlation values at N points equal to or greater than M M in number means for storing values of a predetermined frequency characteristic for frequency points obtained as the discrete Fourier transform means for dividing the stored values by said respective values obtained by the discrete Fourier transform means for obtaining inverse discrete Fourier transform of the N divided values and means for initializing, with the numerical values obtained as the inverse discrete Fourier transform, the tap gain of a transversal automatic equalizer with the basic delay interval equal to one half the symbol interval thereby permitting a sufficiently equalized state to be realized fast with a short test sequence.
