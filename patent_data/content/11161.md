## Description
Finely Powdered Fibroin and Process for Producing SDameThis invention relates to finely powdered high purity fibroin and a process for producing the same.Powdered silk fibroin is considered to be useful as an additive for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations, because of its moderate moisture absorption and retention properties and its high affinity for the human skin. Currently available silk fibroin powders are generally produced by finely dividing silk thread with a pulverizer.Such a silk fibroin powder consists of filamentous fibers cut in very short lengths rather than nearly globular particles and, when used as aii additive for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations, gives rise to various difficulties.For example, in mixing the powder with other ingredients in globular form, it is so liable to aggregation that a homo geneous final product is hardly obtained. Even is such a product is obtained, it shows poor slip properties upon application to the human kin and may occasionally produce round agglomerates of silk fibroin. Thus, it can be said that these difficulties prevent us from making good use of the excellent properties of silk fibroin With this background the present inventors haze made repeated studies on the production of a homogeneous fine powder of fihrei n ,lobu ulur particulate form rather t lan in fibrous form.In this field of art, for example process for producin silk fibroin suitable f r use chromatography is disclosed in Japanese Patent PublicationNo. l941 64. his process comprises dissolving silk fibroin in a cuproammonium solution or a solution of a copper con.plex for example, a cupri ethylenediamine solution , neutralizing the resulting solution with an acid, and then adding an alcohol to the neutralized solution to forw a white precipitate of silk fibroin.As a result of confirmatory tests made by the present inventors, it has been found that this process requires 2 ve y large amount of alcohol and, moreover, the resulting pores state is too sticky to be separated b filtration. Another process for producing a powder of silk fibroin is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 4947 51This process comprises dissolving degummed silk fiber in a concentrated aqueous solution of a neutral salt such as calcium nitrate, dialyzing the resulting solution, and.spray drying the colloidal solution so formed. However, the powder of silk fibroin thus obtained is abnormally hydrophilic and, therefore, unsuitable for use as an additive for cosmetic preparatiolls . In addition, there have been proposed other processes which involves hydrolysing silk thread with an acid or alkali to prepare a silk fibroin solution and then precipitating the silk fibroin either by neutralization or by the addition of an alcohol. In the fine powders of silk fibroin produced by these processes, however, the molecular weight is reduced to those of oligomers and the characteristic properties of silk are completely lost.X ray diffraction analysis and infrared spectroscopic analysis have revealed that, in the conventional fine powders of silk fibroin produced by various processes involving tion of silk fibroin, the silk fibroin molecules contained therein have either a random configuration or the a configura tion and the degree of crystallinity is so loii as to imply the amorphous state rather than the crystalline state.In order to overcome the above described difficulties, the present inventors have made a series of intensive and extensive studies on the principle of rendering finely powdered fibroin hydrophobic to such a degree that it shows no stickiness in the presence of water, and have thereby completed this invention.It is an object of this invention to provide a fine powder of fibroin in nonfibrous and particulate form. Another object of this invention is to provide a fine powder of fibroin in nonfibrous and particulate form which, when used as an additive for cosmetic preparations, exhibits good compatibility and dispersibility with other base materials, moderate swelling properties, and excellent slip properties without adherence to the skin. Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing a fine powder of fibroin in nonfibrous and particulate form which permits its industrial production with great ease and at lo cost.In accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided a regenerated fibroin in nonfibrous and particulate form which has an average molecular weight of not less than 50,000, particle diameters of from 1 to 100 , and a bulk density of frurn C.l to 0,7g cm as measured in the dry state and which contains at least 50 by weight of hot waterinsoluble fibroin having the ss configuration.In accordance with another aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for producing such a fine powder of fibroin i nonfibrous and particulate form. In one specifice embodiment, the process comprises the steps of dissoiving a silk material in at least one solvent selected from the group consisting of an aqueous cupri ethylenediamine solution. an aqueous ammoniacal solution of cupric hydroxide, an aqueous alkaline solution of cupric hydroxide and glycerol, an aqueous lithium bromide solution, an aqueous solution of the chloride, nitrate of thiocyanate of calcium, magnesiwn or zinc, and an aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution adding a coagulating salt to the resulting aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 by weight to coagulate and precipitate the fibroin dehydrating and drying the gel so formed and tn pulverizing the result ing powder. In another specific embodiment, the process comprises the steps of dissolving a degummed silk material in at least one solvent selected from the group consisting of an aqueous cupri ethylenedialnine solution, an aqueous ammoniacal solution of cupric hydroxide, an aqueous alkaline solution of cupric hydroxide and glycerol, an aqueous lithium bromide solution, an aqueous solution of the chloride, nitrate or thiocyanate of calcium, magnesium or zinc, and an aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution dialyzing the resulting aqueous fibroin solution subjecting the dialyzed aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 by weight to at least one treatment for coagulating and precipitating the fibroin, the treatment being selected from the group consisting of the addition of an alcohol, the addition of a coagulating salt, aeration, coagulation at the isoelectric point, exposure to ultrasonic waves, and agitation at high shear rate dehydrating and drying the gel so formed and then pulverizing the resulting powder. The fine powder of fibroin in nonfibrous and particulate form which is produced by the process of this invention has an average molecular weight of not less than 50,000, a degree of molecular orientation equal to not greater than one half that of natural silk thread, particle diameters of from 1 to 100 . and a bulk density of from 0.1 to 0.7 g cm3, and contains at least 50 by weight of hot water insoluble fibroin having the S configuration. The solvent for fibroin which is used in the process of this invention can be an aqueous cupri ethylenediamine solution, an aqueous am1tl0niacal solution of cupric hydroxide Schweitzer s reagent , an aqueous alkaline solution of cupric hydroxide and glycerol Roc s reagent , an aqueous lithiur l bromide solution, an aqueous solution of tile chloride, nitrate, or thiocyanate of calcium, magnesium, or zinc, and an aqueous sodium thiocyanate sclution. However, it is preferable to use an aqueous solution of the chloride or nitrate of calciun or magnesium, because of its low cost and convenience for use.The concentrations of these aqueous solutions may vary according to the type of volute used, temperature, and the like. were an aqueous solution of a metal salt is used, its concentration is generally from 5 to 808 by weight, preferably from 20 to 70 by weight, and most preferably from 25 to 60 by weightThe silk material which s used in the process of this invention can be cocoons raw silk, waste cocoons, raw silk waste, bisu unreelable cocoons , silk fabric waste, bourette, and the like. Prior to use, the silk material is degummed or freed from sericin by any conventional procedure. For example, it is washed in warm water containing a surfaceactive agent or an enzyme according to the need, and then dried.Using a suitable apparatus such as kneader, the degummed silk material is dissolved in the solvent which is selectedfrom among the aforesaid aqueous solutions and preheated to a temperature of from 60 to 950C and preferably from 70 to 85 C. The solvent is generally used in an amount of from 2 to 50 parts by weight and preferably from 3 to 30 parts by weight per parts by weight of the degummed silk material.Where the coagulation step is carried out by the addition of a coagulatina salt, the resulting aqueous fibroin solution may be used directly. jiowever, the aqueous fibroin solution must be dialyzed before it can be subjected to any one of the other treatments. It is also prefcrable to dialyze the aqueous fibroin solution in case of the addition of a coagulating salt.In the dialysis step, the salt contained in the aqueous silk fibroin solution is almost completely removed by means of a dialyzer using semipermeable membranes or hollow fibers, typically made of cellophane. In order that a gel of fibroin may be formed stably and rapidly, there must be a proper corrolation between the volume of the solution to be dialyzed and the surface area of the dialysis membrane. More specifically, desalting should be carried out b the use of a multi layer membrane structure or bundled hollb fiber structure satisfying the condition expressed by Membrane Surface Area cmê 10 Priming Volume cm where the priming volume means the internal volume within the tubing or between the layers.If the value of the abovedefined ratio is less than 10, the removal of the salt through the membrane is not effected rapidly and, moreover, not a stable gel of fibroin but only a sticky precipitate is formed in the succeeding coagulation step. In order to carry out the process of this invention smoothly and economically, the above defined ratio should preferably have a value of not less than 30 and most preferably a value of not less than 50. In the case of a multilayer membrane structure, for example, it is necessary to keep the spacing between layers at 2mm or less for the purpose of satisfying the aforesaid condition. In the case of a bundled hdllow fiber structure which is more suited to the satisfaction of the aforesaid condition, it is necessary to use hollow fibers having a diameter of 4 mm or less.In the process of this invention, the dialyzed aqueous fibroin solution has very low residual salt concentration of from 0.00o to 0.06 , by weight, so that an extremely high purity of fibroin can be achieved. before being transferred to the coagulation step, the aqueous fibroin solution is adjusted to a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 by weight, preferably from 4 to 15 by weight, and most preferably from 5 to 10 by weight. there the dialysis step is omitted, the aqueous fibroin solution is necessarily prepared so that it will have a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 by weight. Where the aqueous fibroin solution is subjected to dialysis, however, the dialyzed aqueous fibroin solution may be either concentrated or diluted until the desired firboin concentration is attained.If the fibroin concentration is less than 3 by weight, a homogeneous mass of gel is not formed h d a long time is required for the coagulation step which leads to an economic loss , while if it is greater than 20 try wight, a stable mass of gel is formed but its dehydration becomes very difficult.After adjustment of the fibroin concentration, the aqueous fibroin solution is subjected to the coagulation step. First of all, a homogeneous mass of gel can be formed by the addition of an alcohol to the aqueous fibroin solution having an appropriate fibroin concentration within the above defined range. The amount of alcohol added should generally be from 1 to 150ö by weight, preferably from 5 to 80 ó by weight, and most preferably from 10 to 60 by weight based on the weight of the aqueous fibroin solution. If the amount of alcohol added is less than 1 by weight, no gel is formed and, even if it is formed, a very long time is required. On the other hand, if it is greater than 150 by weight, a sticky precipitate rather than a stable mass of gel is formed and its dehydration becomes very difficult. There is a correlation between the amount of alcohol added and the fibroin concentration of the aqueous fibroin solution. More specifically, the product of the fibroin concentration t by weight and the amount of alcohol added t b weight should generally have a value of from 10 to 10,000 and preferably from 15 to 500. The alcohol may be added to the aqueous fibroin solution, and vice versa. In either case, a homogeneous and stable mass of gel is usually formed in an instant or within several hours.The alcohols which can be used in the process of this invention include monohydric aliphatic alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, pentyl alcohol, octyl alcohol, etc. dihydric aliphatic alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, etc. and trihydric alcohols such as glycerol. However, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol are preferred because they permit a stable mass of gel to be formed easily. where the addition of a coagulating salt is used, a concentrated aqueous solution of a salt such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, etc. is added to and mixed with the aqueous fibroin solution and the resulting mixture is stirred to precipitate the fibroin. If a calcium salt is used in the dissolution step and a sulfate in the coagulation step, a coprecipitation of calcium sulfate takes place. The concentration of the concentrated aqueous solution of a coagulating salt is usually adjusted so that the resulting mixture will contain from 5 to 108 by weight of the coagulating salt.Aeration is carried out by bubbling air through the aqueous fibroin solution according to any suitable technique. For each liter of the aqueous fibroin solution, air is usually fed at a rate of at least 0.1 L min. The aeration time is generally 10 minutes or more, though it depends on the feed rate of air.Coagulation at the isoelectric point is carried out by adding an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. or an organic acid such as acetic acid, citric acid, etc. , with stirring, to the aqueous fibroin solution until its p11 reaches 4.5. Then, tliis aqueous fibroin solution is generally allowed to stand at room temperature for a period of 10 minutes or more.Exposure to ultrasonic waves is curried out by placing the aqueous fibroin solution in an ultrasonic wave generator and exposing it, with stirring, to ultrasonic waves which generally have frequencies of 30 kRz or higher. The fibroin is coagulated by continuing this treatment at room temperature for a period of 1 hour or more.The fibroin can also be precipitated simply by agitating the aqueous fibroin solution. However, this agitation must be carried out at a high shear rate which is generally 50 sec or more and preferably 100 sec or more. The agitation time required for gelation is generally 1 hour or more, though it depends on the concentration of the aqueous fibroin solution, the shear rate, and the like.During this agitation, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, or acetone may be added to the aqueous fibroin solution so that the rate of S configuration can be raised to the order of 70 . The amount of alcohol or acetone added is suitably from 1 to 100 by weight based on the weight of the aqueous fibroin solution.The mass of gel so formed is subjected to the dehydration step.This step is preferably carried out by the use of 9 centrifuge, and the stable mass of gel formed in accordance with this invention is generally dehydrated to a water content of the order of from ILO to 500 by heigllL based oll tilC weight of the solid contained therein. During the dehydration step carried out by centrifugation, the nass of gel is broken to fragments of small sizes which can then be easily dried to the absolute dry state.This drying step is carried out at a temperature of from 60 to 120 C under normal or reduced pressure.The powder of fibroin thus obtained is subsequently pulverized by the use of a pulverizer such as hammer mill or jet mill.The particle diameters should be adjusted to a range of from 1 to l00, preferably from 4 to 80ji, and most preferably from 5 to 30 . If the particle diameters are less than 1 , the resulting fine powder shows poor dispersibility and compatibility when used as an additive for cosmetic preparations, while if they are greater than 100 , the resulting fine powder has low affinity for the skin and poor slip properties on the skin. Since the present process for producing a fine powder of fibroin involves gelation followed by dehydration and drying, the resulting fibroin particles are considered to have very minute pores to which their good moisture absorption and retention properties are attributable.However, this may lead to the disadvantage that the fine powder of fibroin becomes excessively swollen in certain applications. It is desirable, therefore, to subject the resulting fine powder of fibroin to a wet heat treatment comprising exposure to saturated steam at a temperature of 50 C or above and preferably from 80 to 1200C. This treatment may be applied either to the powder ensuing from the dehydration and drying step or to the fine powder ensuing from the pulverization step. Moreover, the fine powder of fibroin can further be insolubilized in hot water by, prior to drying, heating the dehydrated gel at a temperature of 50 C or above in an aqueous solution of a neutral salt such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate, etc. or in an organic solvent such as acetone, alcohol, etc.The fine powder of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention has a degree of crystallinity of not less than 205, preferably not less than 30t, and most preferably not less than 40 . The degree of crystallinity was determined in the following manner An aqueous fibroin solution containing 5 by weight of a fibroin produced in accordance with this invention was poured cn a Teflon plate and then dried at a temperature of 50 C to form a fibroin film having a thickness of about 60Ju. This fibroin film was regarded as amorphous 0 while raw silk as completely crystalline 100 .The degree of crystallinity was expressed as a relative value on the scale defined between these standard points.The fine powder of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention has a bulk density of from 0.1 to 0.7 g cm3 and preferably from 0.2 to 0.6 g cm3 as measured in the dry state. If the bulk density is less than 0.1 g cm3, the fine powder of fibroin has poor compatibility and dispersibility and, when used as an additive for cosmetic preparations, may produce a phase separation. If it is greater than 0.7 g cm3, the fine powder of fibroin is descreased in moisture absorption and retention properties. The bulk density was measured in the most closely packed state by means of a commercially available powder tester manufactured and sold by Hosokawa Tekkosho, Itd. .The fine powder of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention contains at least 5.08 by weight of hotwater insoluble fibroin having the B configuration. If the content of hot water insoluble fibroin is less than 50 Ó by weight, the fine powder is extremely hydrophilic and liable to deterioration. Moreover, when used as a base material for cosmetic preparations, it shows a high degree of sticky ness and gives a disagreeable feeling to the skin.The content of hot water insoluble fibroin or rate of B configuration was determined in the following manner lOg absolute dry weight of a fine powder of fibroin to be tested was boiled in 1Q of hot water at a temperature of 1000C for a period of 15 minutes, and the undissolved fraction of fibroin was absolutely dried and weighcd. Then, the content of hot water insoluble fibroin was calculated from the equation Content of Hot water insoluble Fibroin W x 100 by weight 10 where W stands for the absolute dry weight in g of the undissolved fraction of fibroin.The fine powder of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention has a high purity as well as good moisture absorption and retention properties. Accordingly, it is very useful as an additive for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations.It is also suitable for use as an adsorbent in pharmaceutical and hygienic applications, because the fibroin particles contained therein have very minute pores offing to the special manner of production.The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples.Example 1In this example, raw silk waste was used as the starting material for the production of fine powders of fibrin. Three kg of raw silk waste was immersed in 100 of water containing 0.3E by weight of marseille soap, stirred at 800C for 1 hour, treated with a sericinolytic enzyme to remove the sericin almost completely, washed with water, and then dried.By stirring in a kneader, 1 kg portions of raw silk waste degummed as above ere dissolved in 10 kg each of aqueous calcium chloride solutions having the respective calcium chloride concentrations indicated in Table 1. As can be seen from the data of this table, the process of this invention allowed the raw silk waste to be dissolved easily. however, when the calcium chloride concentration was less than 5 by weight as in Control Runs 1 1 and 1 2 , it was hardly dissolved even after a long period of time 24 hours or more .The resulting aqueous fibroin solutions were then desalted by passing each of them through a dialyzer of the hollowfiber type at a rate of 1 2 hr. This dialyzer was composed of 2,000 hollow fibers of regenerated cellulose having an internal diameter of 200Jl a membrane thickness of 20 y, and a length of 500 mm, both ends of these hollow fibers being bundled and sealed without blocking up their hollow.bores. In this case, the patio of membrane surface area cm2 to priming volume cm had a value of 100. After completion of the dialysis, the aqueous fibroin solutions had fibroin concentrations of 5.3 6.7 by weight and residual calcium chloride concentrations of 0.007 p.O33 by weight.The molecular eight of the fibroin contained in each of the dialyzed aqueous fibroin solutions was measured by gel permeation chromatography. When the calcium chloride concentration was greater than 80 by weight as in ControlRun 1 15 , the molecular weight was reduced to the order of 40,000. In the aqueous fibroin solutions prepared in accordance with this invention, however, the fibroin contained therein had a molecular weight of not less than 50,000 and showed no appreciable degree of hydrolysis.

Example 2The procedure of Test Run l 12 in Example 1 was repeated except that the calcium chloride as replaced by calcium nitratc. After dialysis, the resulting aqueous fibroin solution had a fibroin concentration of 6.2 by weight and a residual calcium nitrate concentration of 0.015 by weight. This aqueous fibroin solution was either con cent rated or diluted with water to prepare a series of aqueous fibroin solutions having the respective fibroin concentrations indicated in Table 2.An alcohol was added to ea l. of the above aqueous fibroin solutions and the form of he resulting gel was observed.When the fibroin concentr3.tion was less than 3 by weight at in Control Runs 2 1 and 2 2 or when the amount of alcohol added was greater than 150 by weight of the aqueous fibroin solution as in Control Runs 2 6 , 2 14 .and 2 18 not a homogeneous mass of gel but a white precipitate was formed. This precipitate was too sticky to be separated by conventional filtration under reduced pressure. When it was placed in a cloth bag and then centrifuged, it aggregated into a bulky and sticky mass which was very difficult of dehydration and drying. On the other hand, when the amount of alcohol added was less than 1 by weight as in ControlRuns 2 8 and 2 15 , no gelation was recognized even after the mixture was allowed to stand for a whole day and night.Furthermore, when the fibroin concentration was greater than 20 by weight as in Control Run 2 22 , the resulting mass of gel was so tough that it could hardly be dehydrated by centrifugation.However, the process of this invention allowed a homagenenous mass of gel to be formed in an instant or within several hours after the addition of an alcohol. When dehydrated by centrifugation, the mass of gel was broken to fragments having sizes of the order of several millimetcrs nd ear contents of 110 480t by weight .ethyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol made no substantial ifferences in the form of the resulting gel and the requirements for further treatr ent. The dehydrated gel was dried in a hot air oven set at 90 lOOsC or a vacuum dryer set at 70 C to obtain a fine granular product of fibroin suitable for direct pulverization with a jet mill. Subsequently, the granular product was subjected to a wet heat treatment comprising exposure to saturated steam at 1200C for 20 minutes, and then pulverized with a jet mill to obtain a fine powder of fibroin consisting of nearly globular particles, 98 or more of which had diameters Of 5 40 . fhen measurements of the bulk density were made, all the fine powders of fibroin, except that produced in ControlRun 2 22 , were found to have values within the range of 0.1 0.7 g cm3. The reason for this seems to be that the fibroin particles contained therein had minute pores owing to the special manner of production in which a powder is derived from a homogeneous mass of gel.In all the fine powders of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention, the content of hot water insoluble fibroin or rate of ss configuration was found to be not less than 70 by weight and the degree of molecular orientation was found to be not greater than one half that of natural silk.Furthermore, measurements of the rate of moisture absorption were made. More specifically, a sample of each fine powder of fibroin was allowed to stand in an atmosphere having a temperature of 209v and a relative humidity of 5, and the amount of water absorbed was measured after 2 hours.For purposes of comparison, a fine powder of fibroin produced by finely dividing silk yarn with a pulverizer had a rate of moisture absorption of 2 3 by eight as measured by the same method.The results of these measurements are given in Table 2.

Example 3One kg ,f spun silk waste or bourette was immersed in 30z of water containing 0.5 Ó by eight of marseille soap, stirred at lCO C for 1 hour to rerove the sericin and cily matter almost completely, washed thoroughly with water, and then dried at 700 C. In the kneader having a capacity of 502, a solution of 7.5kg of calcium chloride in 5kg of water and 4kg of ethyl alcohol was prepared, and 3 kg of bourette degummed as above was dissolved therein by stirring at 8O0C for 1 hour. After completion of the dissolution, 9kg of water preheated to 8O0C was added.The resulting fibroin solution was filtered to remove any insoluble foreign matter such as chrysalis refuse, and then desalted by passing it through the same dialyzer of the hollow fiber type as used in Example 1. The aqueous fibroin solution thus obtained had a fibroin concentration of 6.28 by weight and a residual calcium chloride concentration of 0.021 by weight. When lOkg of ethyl alcohol was added, with stirring, to 40 kg of an aqueous fibroin solution prepared as above and the resulting mixture was allowed to stand, a homogeneous mass of gel was formed in 20 minutes. This mass of gel was placed in a bag made of polyester fabric and then centrifuged to obtain fragments of gel having water contents of 250 350 by weight.After the dehydrated gel was dried in a vacuum dryer set at 8O0C, a part of the resulting granular product was directly pulverized with a jet mill and the rest was subjected to a wet heat treatment comprising exposure to saturated steam at llO C for 10 minutes and then pulverized with a jet mill.Thus, a variety of fine powders of fibroin having the respective particle diameter ranges indicated in Table 3 were obtained.Using a mixer, each of the above fine powders of fibroin was blended with an equal weight of a commercially available fine powder or talc, and the compatibility and dispersibility of the resulting blend ere examined under the microscope.It was found that its dispersibility became poor when the diameters of fibroin particles were excessively large or small. Especially when the fine powder of fibroin had particle diameters of less than 1 p as in Control Run 3 1 . or when it had particle diameters of greater than lOGy as in Control Runs 3 12 and 3 13 , the fibroin and the talc tended to aggregate separately in the form of spots. Then the diameters of fibroin particles ere within the range of 1 100 lOO u and particularly 4 80 S as taught by this invention, the fibroin and the talc showed very good compatibility and dispersibility. In addition, a sample of each fine powder of fibroin was placed on a hand and rubbed with fingers. As a result, the fine powders of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention spread uniformly over the skin without any appreciable degree of agglomeration and showed good slip properties.Especially the fine powders of fibroin subjected to a wet heat treatment were superior in slip and non agglomeration properties to those subjected to no wet heat treatment. This is presumed to be due to the enhancement of crystallinity of fibroin caused by the wet heat treatment. In fact, when the fine powders of fibroin produced in Test Runs 3 4 and 3 5 were examined by X ray diffraction analysis, the degree of crystallinity was 28 in the fine powder of fibroin subjected to no wet heat treatment and 45 in that subjected to a wet heat treatment. Noreover, the content of hot water insoluble fibroin or rate of B configuration was 52 by weight in the fine powder of fibroin subjected to no wet treatment and 9SOb by weight in that subjected to a wet heat treatment. However, the fine powder of fibroin produ ed in Control Run 3 1 , which had particle diameters of less than 1 ji, formed round agglomerates when placed on the skin and rubbed with fingers. On the other hand, the fine powders of fibroin produced in ControlRuns 3 12 and 3 13 , which had particle diameters of greater than 100 . felt rough and showed very poor slip properties.

Example 4 Jn this example, spun silk waste was used as the starting material for the production of fine powders of fibroin. One kg of spun silk waste was immersed in a solution of 300 of marseille soap in 30t of water, stirred at 95 98 C for 3 hours to reduce its gum content to 0.1 by weight or less, wasted with water, and then dried in hot air at 80 C. Anhydrous zinc chloride ZnC12 was dissolved in water to prepare its aqueous solutions having the respective zinc chloride concentrations indicated in Table 4, which were then heated to 70 C. By stirring in a kneader, various amounts of spun silk waste degummed as above ere dissolved in 10keg each of the zinc chloride solutions to prepare fibroin solutions having the respective fibroin concentrations indicated inTable 1. As can be seen from the data of Table 4, the process of this invention allowed the waste to be dissolved easily.However, when the zinc chloride concentration was less than 5 b weight as in Run 4 l , it was hardly dissolved even after a long period of time 24 hours or more . The, each of the resulting fibroin solutions was mixed with a concentrated solution containing the same amount of ammonium sulfate as that of zinc chloride used, so that a gel like precipitate of fibroin was formed. This precipitate was allowed to stand at 70 C for 20 minutes in the concentrated solution of ammonium sulfate, separated by filtration, washed with water, and then dehydrated by centrifugation.As can be seen from the data of Table 4, the process of this invention caused a homogeneous mass of gel to be formed in an instant or within several hours and, when dehydrated by centrifugation, the mass of gel was broken to fragments having sizes of the order of several millimeters. However, when the fibroin concentration was less than 3 by weight as in Runs 4 5 and 4 11 or when it was greater than 209ó by weight as in Runs 4 10 and 4 16 , not a homogeneous mass of gel but a white precipitate was formed. This precipitate was too sticky to be separated by conventional filtration under reduced pressure. Then it was placed in a cloth bag and then centrifuged, it aggregated into a bulky and sticky mass which was very difficult of dehydration and drying.In each test run, the dehydrated gel was dried in a hot air oven set at 90 100 C or a vacuum drer set at 70 C to obtain a fine granular product of silk fibroin suitable for direct puive. zation. Subsequently, the granular product was pulverized with a jet mill to obtain a fine powder of fibroin consisting of ncarly globular particles, 98 of more of which had diameters of 5 40 . When measurements of the bulk density were made, all the fine powders of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention, and not those produced in the control runs, were found to have values within the range of 0.1 0.7 g cm3. The reason for this seems to be that the particles had minute pores owing to the special manner of production in which a powder is derived from a homogeneous mass of gel.When measurements were made of the content of hot waterinsoluble fibroin or rate of 8 configuration, all the fine powders produced in accordance with this invention were found to have values of not less than 50t by weight. In addition, X ray diffraction analysis revealed that the degree of crystallinity was not less than 25 in all the fine powders of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention.

Example 5Spun silk waste was degummed in the same manner as describe in Example 4 and used as the starting material for the produc tion of fine ponders o fibroin. Clacium chloride CaCl2 4H2O was dissolved in water to prepare its aqueous solutions having the respective calcium chloride concentrations indicated iTable 5, which were then heated to 950C. By stirring in a kneader, 10 parts of spun silk waste degummed as above were dissolved in 100 parts each of the calcium shloride solutions to prepare a series of fibroin solutions. As can be seen from the data of viable 5, the process of this invention allowed the spun ilk waste to be dissolved easily.However, when the calcium chloride concentration was less than 10 by weight as in Run 5 1 , it was hardly dissolved even after a long period of time t24 hours or more .The resulting aqueous fibroin solutions were then desalted by passing each of them through a dialyzer of the hollowfiber type at a rate of 1 Q hr. This dialyzer was composed of 2,000 hollow fibers of regenerated cellulose havnig an internal diameter Of 200 . a membrane thickness of 20, and a length cf 500 mm, both ends of these hollow fibers being bundled and sealed without blocking up their hollow bores.In this case, the ratio of membrane surface area cmê to priming volume cm had a value of 100. After completion of the dialysis, the aqueous fibroin solutions had fibroin concentrations of 3.2 6.7 by weight and residual calcium chloride concentrations of 0.007 0.033 by weight.The molecular weight of the fibroin contained in each of the dialyzed aqueous fibroin solutions was measured by gel permeation chromatography. When the calcium chloride concentration was greater than SO9 by weight as in Control Runs 5 16 and 5 17 , the molecular weight was reduced to the order of 40,000. In the aqueous fibroin solutions prepared in accordance with this invention, however, the fibroin contained therein had a molecular weight of not less than 50,000 and showed no appreciable degree of.hydrolysis.These aqueous fibroin solutions were then adjusted, by either concentration or dilution, to the respective fibroin concentra tions indicated in Table 5. Each of the resulting aqueous silk fibroin solutions was agitated at room temperature and at such a high speed as to give a shear rate of the order of 100 sec. In the course of 2 3 hours agitation, the fibroin gradually precipitated and ultimately formed a mass of gel composed of a collection of small fragments of gel. However, when the fibroin concentration was less than 3 by weight as in Control Runs 5 2 and 5 9 or when it was greater than 20 by weight as in Control Runs 5 8 and 5 15 , not a homogeneous mass of gel but a white precipitate was formed.This precipitate was too sticky to be separated by conventional filtration under recuded pressure. When it was placed in a cloth bag and then centrifuged, it aggregated into a bulky and sticky mass which was very difficult of dehydration and drying. In each run, the gel so formed was dehydrated by means of a centrifuge and then dried in hot air at 105 C. Using a jet mill, the resulting powder was pulverized and then subjected to a wet heat treatment comprising exposure to saturated steam at 1200C for 15 minutes. The fine powder of fibroin consisted of nearly globular particles, 98 or more of which had diameters of 5 40 ji. When measurements of the bulk density were made, all the fine powders of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention were found to have values whthin the range of 0.1 0.7 g cm3.The reason for this seems to be that the fibroin particles contained therein have minute pores owing to the special manner of production in which a powder is derived from a homogeneous mass of gel. Then measure ments were made of the content of hot water insoluble fibroin or rate of ss configuration, all the fine powders produced in accordance with this invention were found to have values of not less than 50 by weight. In addition,X ray diffraction analysis revealed that the degree of crystallinity was not less than 25 in all the fine powders of fibroin produced in accordance with this invention.

Example 6Spun silk waste was egunmed in the same manner as described in Example 4 and used as the starting material for the production of fine powders of fibroin. Anhydrous zinc chloride ZnC12 was dissolved in water to prepare its aqueous solution having a zinc chloride concentration of 50 by weight, which was then heated to 70 C. According to the procedure ofExample 5, spun silk waste was dissolved in the aqueous calcium chloride solution and the resulting solution was dialyzed and concentrated to prepare an aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of 10 by weight.A 100 Q portion of this aqueous fibroin solution was placed in a vessel and treated, with stirring, 1 by adding thereto 0.1 N sulfuric acid drop by drop until it was adjusted to pH 4.5 isoelectric point and then allowing it to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, 2 by providing a 30 kHz ultrasonic wave generator on the inside wall of the vessel and operating it at room temperature for 1 hour, or 3 by using a pipe to feed air at a rate of 10 2 min and bubble it through the aqueous fibroin solution for 10 minutes. In every case, the fibroin formed a mass of gel composed of a collection of small fregments of gel. This mass of gel was dehydrated by means of a centrifuge and then dried in hot air at 1050C.Using a jet mill, the resulting powder was pulverized to particle diameters of 5 40Ja and, thereafter, subjected to wet heat treatment comprising exposure to saturated steam at 1200C for 30 minutes. The fine powder of fibroin thus obtained was tested for the content of hotwater insoluble fibroin or rate of S configuration by estimation from the loss of weight on boiling in water , degree of crystallinity by X ray diffraction analysis , and bulk density. The results arc given L in V W11 Table 1U Then, the three fine powders of fibroin produced according to the above described procedure were evaluated with respect to several properties desired in base materials for cosmetic preparations. The results are given in Table 7.It can be seen from the data of this table that, when used in cosmetic preparations, all the fine powders of fibroin produced inExample 6 exhibited remarkably good properties.

An aqueous solution containing 8 by weight of ethylenediamine and 6 by weight of cupric hydroxide was prepared, and lkg of spun silk waste degummed as above was dissolved in 10 kg of the cupri ethylenediamine solution by stirring at room temperature for 5 minutes.The resulting solution was immediately adjusted to p11 6.8 with 10 acetic acid and then diluted with water to prepare an aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of 10 by weight. Then, according to the procedure of Example 5, this solution was dialyzed and concentrated to prepare an aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of 15 by weight. The resulting aqueous fibroin solution was agitated at room temperature and at such a high speed as to give a shear rate of the order of 100 sec. In the course of 2 3 hours agitation, the fibroin was gradually precipitated and ultimately formed a mass of gel.The mass of gel was dehydrated by means of a centrifuge and then dried in hot air at 1050C. Using a jet mill, the resulting powder was pulverized to particle diameters of 5 15çu and, thereafter, subjected to a wet heat treatment comprising exposure to saturated steam at llo C for 15 minutes. When the fine powder of fibroin thus obtained was tested, its content of hot water insoluble fibroin or rate of B configuration was found to be about 83 by estimation from the loss of weight on boiling in water, and 80 by infrared spectroscopic analysis. Moreover, ts degree of crystallinity was found to be about 56 by X ray diffraction analysis and its bulk density was found to be 0.52 g cm3. On the other hand, when a fine powder of fibroin produced in the same manner except for the omission of the wet heat treatment was tested, its content of hot water insoluble fibroin or rate of a configuration was found to be 53 and its degree of crystallinity was found to be about 21 .Then, the fine powders of silk fibroin produced according to the above described procedure were evaluated with respect to several properties desired in base materials for cosmetic preparations. The results are given in Table 8.

The resulting masses of gel were dehydrated and dried, subjected to a wet heat treatment at 110 C for 30 rnutes, and then pulverized to particle diameters of 1 50 by means of a jet mill.Though slight variations were noted according to the methods of dissolution and precipitation, the fine powders of fibroin thus obtained had contents of hot water insoluble fibroin ranging frorn 70 to 95 by weight and degrees of crystallinity ranging from 40 to 60 .It can be seen from the data of Table 10 that, when used as a base material for cosmetic preparations, the fine powders of fibroin produced according to the various methods of dissolution exhibited remarkably good properties.

Shortly summarized the invention comprises finely powdered high purity fibroin and a process tor producing the same. The fibroin is a fine powder of regenerated fibroin in non fibrous and particulate form which has an average molecular weight of not less than 50,000, particle diameters, of fron 1 to 100 , and a bulk density of from 0.1 to 0,7 g cm as measured in the dry state and which contains at least 50 by weight of hot water insoluble fibroin having the B configuration.The process comprises dissolving a degumed silk material in at least one solvent selected srom the group consisting of an aqueous cupri ethylenediamine solution, an aqueous ammoniacal solution of cupric hydroxide, an aqueous alkaline solution of cupric hydroxide and glycerol, an aqueous lithium bromide solution, an aqueous solution of the chloride, nitrate or thiocyanate of calcium, magnesium or zinc, and an aqueous sodium thiocya .nate solution adding a coagulating salt to the resulting aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 b weight to coagulate and precipitate the fibroin dehydrating and drying the gel so formed and then pulverizing the resulting powder. Alternatively, the process comprises dissolving a degummed silk material in a solvent as defined above dialyzing the resulting aqueous fibroin solution subjecting the dialyzed aqueous fibroin solution having a fibroin concentration of from 3 to 20 by weight to at least one treatment for coagulating and precipitating the fibroin, the treatment being selected from the group consisting of the addition of an alcohol, the addition of a coagulating salt, aeration, coagulation at the isoelectric point, exposure to ultrasonic waves, and agitation at high shear rate dehydrating and frying the gel so formed and then pulverizing the resulting powder. The fine powder of fibroin thus obtained is particularly useful as an additive for cosmetic preparations.
