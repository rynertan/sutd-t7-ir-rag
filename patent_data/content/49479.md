# Vinyl type polymer composition and its use.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a composition comprising a a vinyl polymer obtained by polymerizing a vinyl monomer or monomers in the presence of a neutralized, water soluble product of an adduct of a substantially amorphous polymer obtained by ring opening polymer ization of dicyclopentadiene represented by the follow ing chemical structural formula The invention composition is useful for coating mate rials, especially for paints.
