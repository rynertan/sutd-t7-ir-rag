## Description
FORAGE HARVESTERS This invention relates to forage harvesters either of the self propelled type or the pull type. Forage harvesters typically comprise some form of crop pickup device which gathers either standing or windrowed crop material and feeds it to an auger whic consolidates the material and feeds it to a cutterhead either directly, in the case of a so called fine chop machine, or indirectly, in the case of a so called precision chop machine. The feeding of crop material to the cutterhead needs to be optimised in order to maximize the capacity and efficiency of the machine.In known forage harvesters this is rarely achieved because the pick up device and the auger jointly are pivotable between operative and transport positions and in order to be able to raise the auger, together with the pick up device, to the transport position about the pivot axis, sufficient spacing has to be allowed between the auger and the cutterhead, or feed rolls in the case of a precision chop machine.This inevitably means that the auger, in the operative position, is spaced further from the cutterhead or feed rolls than the optimum requires which thus detracts from the efficient operation of the forage harvester. According to the present invention a forage harvester comprises a frame, a cutterhead mounted on the frame, an auger structure mounted on the frame and operable to consolidate crop material transversely of the machine and to deliver it rearwardly of the machine for processing by the cutterhead, the auger structure comprising an auger rotatably mounted on the frame and an auger trough fixed to the frame and cooperable with the auger, and a rick up device operable to delivercrop material to the auger structure and being mounted for pivotal movement relative to the auger structure at a location generally in front and in proximity to the leading edge of the auger trough and about an axis disposed rearwardly of the auger structure, the pick up device in use being pivotable about its pivot axis in following the ground contour, and pivotable about the same axis in moving between a lowered, operative position and a raised, transport position. Preferably, the forward edge of the auger trough is disposed below and between the leading edge of the auger and the axis of rotation of the auger. More particularly, the leading edge of the auger trough may be disposed generally vertically below the leading edge of the auger tube which the auger flights are attached. When in its operative position, the pick up device has its discharge and in close proximity to, and generally aligned with, although positioned slightly above, the level of the auger trough. The auger may be pivotally mounted relative to the trough to accommodate, in use, any lumps of crop material delivered from the pick up device and to this end, the auger may be mounted between a pair of arms which rotatably receive the auger at one end and which are pivotally attached to the frame at the other end. However, it should be noted that the auger is essentially fixed relative to the other components save for the ability to undergo a small movement relative to the trough. The pivot axis of the pick up device conveniently is disposed generally vertically below the pivot axis of the auger in order to simplify the layout of the drive to these two components. The pick up device may be mounted for pivotal movement on a frame including a pair of arms detachably connected to the machine frame and interconnected by a mounting bracket for the pick up device. In this case, location and connection means may be provided for removably attaching the pick up device to the mounting bracket, whereby the type of pick up device is readily changed to that required for a particular harvesting operation.The length of the mounting arms for the pick up device is preferably such that movement of the latter between the operative and transport positions is substantially rectilinear so that it can be disposed in an efficient working relationship with the auger and yet not foul the latter when being raised to the transport position, bearing in mind that the auger is stationary during that operation. The arms of the pick up mounting frame are preferably extended rearwardly by a distance shorter than the length of the arms, and compensation means provided between the extensions and the frame of the machine, the arrangement being such that for a given pivotal movement of the pick up device there is a smaller movement of the extensions, whereby the compensation characteristics of the compensation means remain substantially constant. Forage harvesters constructed in accordance with the present invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic side view of one forage harvester, Figure 2 is a view generally similar to that of Figure 1 but showing certain components in alternative positions, Figure 3 is an enlarged view of a portion of Figure l, Figure 4 is a plan view of Figure l showing certain drives, Figure 5 is a view similar to that of Figure 4 but omitting some drives and showing others, and showing certain components in alternative positions. Figure 6 is a detail of a component of the forage harvester of Figure 1, and Figure 7 is similar to that of Figure 1 but showing an alternative embodiment of forage harvester. Referring to Figures 1 to 6, the forage harvester comprises a frame or chassis 1 on which are mounted a conventional pick up device 2, an auger 3 to which in use the pick up device feeds crop material, and a cutterhead 4 fitted with a partially pivotal delivery or discharge spout 4 . A pair of ground engaging wheels 5 is fitted to the frame 1 and the pick up device 2 is provided with a wheel 10 which can be raised and lowered about a pivot shaft 6 to which it is connected by an arm 7. When in the lowered, operative position, the wheel 10 contacts the ground and follows the ground contour, whereby it raises and lowers the pick up device 2 accordingly so that the latter maintains a substantial constant ground clearance. Generally vertical movement of the pick up device 2 necessary to maintain this ground clearance is permitted by the mounting arrangement for the device which comprises a frame including a pair of relatively long arms 8 each attached at the forward end to a bracket 9 and pivotally attached at the other end to a pivot 11 or 11 via a generally U shaped bracket 12 best seen in Figure 3 having an insert 13 for contact with a portion of the pivot shaft and closeable by another insert 13 which is also U shaped and contacts another portion of the pivot shaft, the inserts together defining a partial bush for the pivot shaft .The insert 13 is held in position by a headed pin 14 Figures 1 and 2 which extends through aligned holes in the limbs of the brackets 12 and the limbs of. the insert 13 and which is retained by a split pin not shown engageable with an aperture in the end of the pin 14. Each arm 8 is provided with an extension 15 the outer end of which is pivotally attached to a short link 16 connected to the exterior of the base of a cup 17 Figure 3 slidably mounted in one end of a cylinder 18. A further cup 19 is attached to the distal end of the cylinder 18 with the two cups 17 and 19 being arranged to receive therebetween a compression spring 21. It should be noted that the righthand pivot lit Figure 4 is in the form of a spigot attached to the frame1, whereas the left hand pivot 11 is in the form of a shaft rotatably mounted on the frame. The pick up device is resiliently suspended in a manner floating by to follow the ground contour by the cylinder 18 and spring 21 arrangements, the extent of resilient suspension or compensation of each arrangement being adjustable by a threaded rod 22 connected at one end to the further cup 19 and at the other end received in a bracket 23 attached to the frame 1. The pick up device is movable between a lowered, operative position shown in full lines in Figures 1 and 3 and a raised, transport position shown in full lines in Figure 2 and broken lines in Figure 3 by a single acting hydraulic actuator 24 Figures 1 and 3 , the cylinder 25 of which is pivotally connected to the frame 1 and the piston 26 of which is pivotally connected to one of the pick up arms 8. The pivotal attachment of the cylinder 25 to the frame 1 is effected by a pivot pin 27 extending from the cylinder 25 and being both slidably and rotatably received in a slot 28 formed in the frame 1, which provides a lost motion connection.In the operative position of the pick up device 2, the pin 27 is arranged to be positioned intermediate the ends of the slot 28, whereby it can slide therein in response to movement of the pick up device in following the ground contour without the necessity for any extension and or contraction of the piston 26.When the actuator 24 is energised, the cylinder 25 first moves to the right as seen in Figures 1 and 3 until the pin 27 engages one end of the slot 28, whereupon the piston 26 is extended and the pick up device 2 raised to the transport position. Wnen the pick up device 2 is required in the operative position, the actuator 24 is de energised to allow the pick up to lower, retraction of the piston 26 being assisted by a spring 29 Figure 3 . A plurality of apertures 31 is provided by which the point of connection of the piston 26 to the pick up mounting can be adjusted to suit the required working height of the pick up device 2. The use of relatively long mounting arms 8 for the pick up device 2 enables the pivot shaft 11 therefor to be located as far rearwardly of the machine as possible in order to impart substantially rectilinear movement to the pick up when it moved to and from the operative position. This prevents the pick up 2 fouling the auger 3 when moved to the operative position. The bracket 9 is provided with a forwardly extending lip or flange 32 which provides a seat for the pick up device 2, more specific location and attachment being provided by two transverselyspaced, releasable connectors 33 shown in detail in Figure 6. Each connector 33 comprises a female socket 34 attached to the bracket 9 and having a conical through bore 35. A correspondingly shaped male spigot 30 is provided on the pick up device 2 having a threaded bore 36 for reception of a securing bolt 37. The connectors 33 provide very positive mounting and location devices which are simple to operate for the mounting and detachment of the pick up device 2. The auger 3 receives crop material from the pick up device 2 and transfers it to the cutterhead 4 in cooperation with an auger floor or trough 38 attached to members 39 forming part of the frame 1. The auger 3, contrary to known arrangements, is mounted independently of the pick up device 2 and is mounted relative to the cutterhead 4 in order to optimise feeding of crop material to the latter which is critical for efficient operation of the forage harvester. Although the auger 3 is essentially fixed relative to the cutterhead 4, it is capable of a small amount of relative movement both with respect to the cutterhead and to the floor 38 in order to accommodate any relatively large lumps of crop material fed to the latter.This movement is provided for by mounting each end of the auger shaft 41 on one end of an arm 42, the other end of whites Is attached to a pivot 43 or 43 Figure 1 . Auger movement is damped by a pair of springs 44 Figure 1 , one provided at each end of the auger. Each spring 44 acts between a bracket 45 attached to the frame 1 and an abutment 46 carried by a rod 47 which passes through the spring. The rod 47 is slidably received at one end in the bracket 45 and pivotally attached at the other end to a link 48 fixed intermediate the ends of the associated arm 42.It should be noted that the right hand pivot 43 Figure 4 is in the form of a bolt carried by the frame 1, whereas the left hand pivot 43 is a shaft mounted for rotation on the frame 1 and extending from the adjacent side of the cutterhead 4 to the lefthand side of the machine. The cutterhead 4 is conventional and comprises a drive shaft 51 rotatably mounted in sidewalls 52 of the housing or casing 64 and carrying a pair of flanges 54 to the outer circumference of which are attached knives 55 which cooperate with a shearbar 56 Figures 1 and 3 ,It should be noted that the cutterhead 4 is shown more fully inFigures 4 and 5 but only in general outline in the remaining figures. Looking now more closely at the frame 1, this comprises two transverse main beams 61, 62 spaced longitudinally of the machine.From the foremost beam 61 there extend two members 63 which support the overall casing 64 of the machine. From the top of the casing 64 there extend two forwardly and upwardly inclined members 65 forming part of a drawbar 66 for the machine. The members 65 are spaced apart transversely of the machine and between them is rigidly fixed the main portion 67 of the drawbar which is of hollow construction and formed from plates bolted or otherwise secured together.The main drawbar portion 67 extends forwardly and downwardly from the members 65 over the auger 3 and pick up device 2 and tapers towards the front end both in width and in heist as seer, in Figures 1 .d 2 andFigures 4 and 5, re. pective y. Thc main drawb r portion 67 tertinate in a conventional hitch 68 for connection to a tractor or other towing vehicle not shown .A jack 69 is fitted towards the front end of the drawbar 66 to support the machine when unhitched as shown in Figure 1. Drive for the various components of the forage harvester is provided from the power take off PTO shaft of the tractor or other towing vehicle which is connected to a main drive shaft 71 Figures 2 and 5 of the machine which extends in a non parallel relationship with the main drawbar portion 67, whereby the forward position of the shaft is contained within an extension 72 of the main drawbar portion with the remainder being accommodated within the latter. The drive shaft 71 is connected via a universal joint 73 to an input shaft 74 of a gearbox 75 mounted in the rear, upper portion of the drawbar 66. An output shaft 76 of the gearbox 75 extends transversely of the machine and is connected to a shaft 77 carrying a pulley 78. The drives for the forage harvester components are essentially conventional and will, therefore, be described only briefly. Furthermore, the drives are split between several figures of the drawings in order not to obscure any given figure. A belt 79 Figures 2 and 5 extends from around the pulley 78 to a pulley 81 on one end of the cutterhead shaft 51, whereby the latter is driven, a tension pulley 82 being provided. The cutterhead shaft 51 also carries a sprocket 83 at its other end from which a chain 84 extends, via an idler sprocket d5, to a larger diameter sprocket 86 not shown in Figure 4 carried by an idler shaft 87. The idler siiaft 87 in fact carries a double sprocket, the second sprocket 88 being of smaller diameter than the first sprocket 86. A chain 89 extends from around the sprocket 88 to another sprocket 91 carried by the auger pivot shaft 43 to drive the same.A second sprocket 92 provided on the end of the pivot shaft 43 has a chain 93 extending there around to a sprocket 94 carried by the auger shaft 41 which is thus driven in the desired direction indicated by the arrow 95.A third sprocket 96 is carried by the auger pivot shaft 43 and forms part of the drive for the pick up device 2. A chain 97 extends from the sprocket 96, via an idler sprocket 98, to a sprocket 99 mounted on the pick up pivot shaft 11 which also carries a pulley 101.A pulley 102 is provided on a drive shaft 103 for the pick up device 2 and a crossed belt 104 extends between the pulleys 101 and 102 via an adjustable tension pulley 105. The belt 104 is crossed in order to drive the pick up device 2 in a direction 106 opposite to that in which the auger 3 is driven. The ground engaging wheels 5 are adjustably mounted on the frame 1 in order to be able to select a wide or less wide transverse spacing thereof to suit harvesting conditions. The wide spacing of the wheels 5 is shown in Figures 1, 3 and 4, with the narrower spacing being shown in Figures 2 and 5. In Figures 1, 3 and 4, each wheel 5 is mounted for rotation on a wheel mounting bracket 111 attached to one end of the rearmost transverse beam 62 of the frame 1. In Figure 2 and 5 the wheels 5 are attached to alternative wheel mounting brackets 112 provided on the ends of the foremost beam 61 which is shorter than the beam 62 as can be seen in Figures 4 and 5. An automatic hitch 113 is mounted on the rearmost beam 62 for attachment of a forage trailer or wagon not shown . The hitch 113 is removably mounted on the beam 62 and may need to be removed when the wheels 5 are attached to the beam 61 to make hitching of a trailer to the forage harvester impossible when the wheels are positioned at the narrow spacing. The stability of the harvester with narrow wheel spacing may in fact be insufficient to allow attachment of a trailer to the rear of the harvester, especially when working on side hills. The selection of the narrower transverse wheel spacing is usually made when closely spaced windrows are being handled so that the wheels 5 do not run over the windrow adjacent the one being picked up. Under these operating conditions, the forage trailer is usually pulled by another tractor alongside the forage harvester.When machine stability becomes critical, such as when a trailer is hitched to the rear of the harvester and when operating on side hills, a wider wheel spacing becomes desirable and hence the mounting brackets 112 on the beam 62 are used. In order to avoid in general the fouling of the adjacent windrow, in the case of extremely closely spaced windrows, by the pick up device 2 and by the harvester wheels 5, the drawbar 66 is slightly offset from the centre of the machine as seen in Figures 4 and 5 so that the right hand wheel 5 and the right hand end of the pick up device 2 are effectively moved away from the adjacent windrow. It will be noted that the drawbar 60 is aligned with the cutterhead 4, whereby the latter is also offset from the centre of the machine.Furthermore, the automatic hitch 113 is mounted in line with the common centre line of the drawbar 66 and the cutterhead 4. This arrangement is preferred as it provides a very stable train of tractor, forage harvester and wagon or trailer. In use, the forage harvester is hitched to the tractor or other towing vehicle and the PTO of the latter connected to the main drive shaft 71. A trailer or wagon is then hitched to the forage harvester and the train is ready for operation, perhaps first being driven to the I ield containing windrowed crop. The in line train is, of course, very suitable for transport to and from the field and indeed it is normally used by known harvesters. The difference is that with known arrangements, the harvester has to be moved to a position offset from the tractor before harvesting can commence. However, the present invention obviates the need for this, thereby saving time but more importantly dispensing with the pivoted drawbar which is a relatively expensive component.When in the field of operation, the pick up device 2 is moved from the raised, transport position Figure 2 to the lowered, operative position of Figures 1 and 3 by de energising the hydraulic actuator 24. The tractor then pulls the forage harvester and trailer up and down the field, it being possible to commence harvesting at one extreme edge of the field due to the in line train whereas with known arrangements, one has to start with an inner windrow and harvest the extreme windrow or windrows during a reverse pass. The stability of the in line train is extremely good even when the trailer is becoming fully loaded, and the loading is achieved without difficulty since the upper portion of the delivery spout 4 can be moved from side to side without hindrance. The drawbar 66 is relatively short which results in good handling and reduced manufacturing costs. Also, the design of the machine in general, and of, the driveline between the tractor and the forage harvester in particular is much simplier, again reducing costs. These savings, together with that arising from the use of a non pivoted drawbar already discussed, can reduce the standard variable cost of a machine by 2No which is extremely significant. As already mentioned, the relatively long arms 8 give substantially rectilinear movement to the pick up device 2 as it is moved to and from the transport position. If relatively short arms were to be employed, the pick up movement would be more orcuate with a resulting tendency for the pick up to foul the auger 3 on being raised unless adequate spacing of these two components were provided which would detract from the crop feeding operation there between.The minimum transport height of the pick up device is typically 10 inches 25 centimetres . The long arms 8 also serve to position the pick up pivot axis generally vertically below the auger pivot axis which helps considerably in simplifying the drive layout for the driven components.The extensions 15 of the arms 8 are arranged to extend only a relatively short distance from the pick up pivot axis to the links 16.In this way, any movement of the pick up device about its pivot axis in following the ground contour results in a very much smaller movement of the links 16 and hence the associated springs 17. Thus a very constant compensation rate is achieved which would not be the case if large extensions and contractions of the springs 17 were occasioned as the spring characteristics thereof would vary. It will be noted that the leading edge of the auger trough 38 is disposed generally vertically below the leading edge of the auger tube 3 to which the auger flights are attached, the flights being of opposite hand and being separated by feeder means not shown , as is conventional, to feed the crop material to the cutterhead 4. It will also be noted that, on its operative position, the pick up device 2 has its discharge end in close proximity to, and generally aligned with, although positioned slightly above, the level of the auger trough 38. The embodiment of Figures 1 to 6 shows what is Wnown as a fine chop machine but the invention is equally applicable to a precision chon machine which employs feed rolls between the auger and the cutterhead. A precision chop machine is shown in Figure 7 of the drawings and it will be noted that this machine is basically the same a that of Figures 1 to 6 like components being accorded the same reference numerals inasmuch as it comprises an identical pick up device 2, auger 3 and cutterhead 4 although the latter is spaced further from the auger 3 in order to accommodate the feed rolls. The feed rolls comprise a forward pair of rolls 114 and a pair of rearward rolls 115 of smaller diameter.The auger 3 is located ith respect to the feed rolls 114 such that optimum feeding of crop material is effected although, as before, small movement of the auger can take place in order to accommodate any lumps of crop material fed thereto. The type of pick up device 2 can be varied to suit the crop being harvested. The rsiek up device 2 of the embodiments ofFigures 1 and 7 is the conventional device for picking up windrowed crop material but may be replaced by a row crop attachment 116 Figure 8 or cutterbar attachment 117 Figure 9 . In general, the embodiments of Figures 8 and 9 re similar to that of Figure 1 and like components are accorded the same reference numerals. The row crop attachment 116 may comprise one or more row units, each of which is equipped with crop receiving means 121 and crop conveyor means 122. The crop severing anc crop conveyor means may be of the conventional type. In the nrrangement shown in Figure 8, the crop conveyor means 122 comprise upper and lower conveyor chains. With the row crop attachment in the operative position, the lower conveyor chains have their discharge ends in proximity to , and at a level slightly above, the leading edge of the auger trough 38. The cutterbar attachment 117 as shown in Figure 3 cc.m.prises mower means 123 of the disc tylle and disposed to cut standing crop and to propel it generally rearwardly and upwardly over the mower discs in 2 direction towards the auger structure 3. A conveyor assist means in the form of a transverse conveyor roll 124 extends generally rearwardly of the cutting zone of the mower means 123 and in proximity to, and generally below, the leading edge of the auger trough 38 when the attachment 116 is in its operative position. The conveyor roll 124 is rotatable in the direction 125 and is operable to receive crop material from the mower discs as it is propelled rearwardly thereby and to transfer the same overtop into the gap between the auger 3 and the auger trough 38.Conveyor ribs or the like may be provided on the surface of the conveyor roll 124 to improve the grip of the conveyor roll on the crop material. The two main differences of both the row crop attachment 116 and the cutterbar attachment 117 in comparison with the pick up device are the change in the pick up device already mentioned, and the use of a conventional pivotable drawbar 118 which is required because standing crop is harvested by the machine, whereby it is necessary to offset the machine to one side of the tractor otherwise the latter would damage the crop before it was acted upon by the row crop attachment or cutterbar. The connectors 33 permit ready detachment of one pick up device and attachment of another. It will be noted that the row crop attachment 116 and cutterbar attachment 117 are each pivotally mounted by the arms 8 as before, whereby they move relative to the auger in following the ground contour or in moving between the operative and transport positions. This means that the auger 3 is fixed relative to the cutterhead 4 or feed rolls 114, as appropriate, save for the ability to move relative to the tough 38 when lumps of crop material are encountered. Thus the auger 3 can be mounted in the optimum position with respect to the cutterhead 4 or feed rolls 114 to maximise the capacity and efficiency of the machine. In the embodiments disclosed in the accompanying drawings, the alternative transverse spacing of the wheels 5 is accomplished by providing mounting points spaced longitudinally of the machine with the greater spacing provided by the rearmost mounting points.This is not essential and the forwardmost mounting points can provide the greater transverse spacing. Furthermore more than two alternative spacings may be provided. Also, the use of alternative mounting points may be dispensed with in favour of a telescopic axle the length of which can be adjusted to provide the desired transverse wheel spacing.
