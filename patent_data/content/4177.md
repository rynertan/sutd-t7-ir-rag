# A method of metal coating of diamond or cubic boron nitride particles and an abrasive tool containing the particles thus coated.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of metal coating diamond or cubic boron nitride particles, the metal being capable of forming a chemical bond with the particles, including the steps of providing a mass of metal for the coating in powdered form in contact with the particles, heat treating the metal powder and the particles at a temperature below the melting point of the metal to deposit a layer of metal on the particles, and recovering the particles as discrete, metal coated particles, the heat treatment taking place in a non oxidising atmosphere and being chosen to allow chemical bond formation between the particles and the coating.
