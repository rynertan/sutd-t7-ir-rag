# A process for annealing an ion implanted gallium arsenide substrate.

## Abstract
An ion implanted gallium arsenide substrate is annealed by maintaining it at a temperature above about 400 C in an arsenic containing gaseous ambient on all sides of the substrate, and heating the gallium arsenide substrate with broad area incoherent light.
