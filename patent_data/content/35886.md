# Solid state imaging device having a color filter array and methods of preparing same.

## Abstract
A method of making a color filter array comprising differ ently colored sets of filter elements 22 , 24 , 26 on a solid state color imaging device 10 is provided. Each set of filter elements is produced by coating a layer of a radiation sensitive dyeable composition over the device, exposing the layer to a pattern of radiation corresponding to the desired elements, washing off the unexposed composition and dye ing the residual islands with a dye solution. A set of filter elements is protected from a dye solution used in producing a further set of filter elements by a barrier layer formed of a photocrosslinkable dye impermeable polymer. This barrier layer is rendered insoluble by exposure to radiation at least in regions 30 , 32 underlying filter elements if the imaging device is to be contacted with a solvent for the uncrosslinked polymer, as when removing selected portions of a barrier layer from the device or coating a further barrier layer thereon. The undermining by solvent of filter elements formed on any barrier layer is thereby prevented.
