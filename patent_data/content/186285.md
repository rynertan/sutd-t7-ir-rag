# Gas conditioned modular slush molding machine.

## Abstract
A method and an assembly for practicing that method wherein an article is molded of a heat fusing material or plastisol, either liquid or dry, in a mold having an array of gas impingement jets disposed adjacent the backside of a mold surface for controlling the temperature over respective first and second areas of the mold surface. There is included first and second gas heating and cooling circuits each including a blower and dampers for supplying gas at the gas impinge ment jets associated with the mold. All of the gas impinge ment jets are supplied with heated gas to preheat the mold surface to a non gelling temperature and a liquid plastisol coating is applied to the mold surface. To obtain the coating, the mold is filled and the excess plastisol is removed from the mold by dumping the plastisol from the mold into a dump tank. In a liquid plastisol process, a first group of gas jets arranged in close proximity to the mold maintain a temperature higher than the temperature of the liquid in the first area of the mold to a higher temperature than the second area. Additional liquid plastisol is disposed in the mold over the coating and is gelled over the first area of the mold which is heated with the heat supplied by the liquid in the first group of passages thereby gelling a predetermined thickness of the plastisol in selected areas while retaining the thickness over the second area.
