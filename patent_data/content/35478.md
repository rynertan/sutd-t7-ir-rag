## Description
ANTI REDEPOSITION AGENTS The present invention relates to antiredeposition agents antigreying agents consisting of relatively lowmolecular, multifunctional esters, as well as to detergents containing such esters. In the washing of a wash such as articles of clothing and other textiles, the dirt is removed from the wash during the washing process by chemical and physical action The dirt is then held. suspended and emulsified in the washing water in the form of small particles. In the ideal situation, the dirt is removed completely along with the washing water during the emptying operation, but since the size of the wash is often large in relation to the volume of water involved, a certain redeposition of dirt takes place onto the fibres of the wash. The redeposited dirt is normally finely divided and manifests itself as a general greying of the textiles rather than in the form of spots or blotches. Naturally, this greying is particularly troublesome when white textiles are involved, but is also noticeable on a coloured wash, and in particular black textiles to which a grey hue is imparted. It has been found that the redeposition of dirt is dependent upon several factors. The physical properties and chemical structure of the dirt play an important rule, as well as the selection of surfactant and builder in the detergent. The perhaps most important single factor is, however, the type of fibre in the wash. Different fibres are hydrophilic to different degrees, have different zpotential and different capacities to form hydrogen bondings, properties which are decisive for the degree of greying. Already in thel930ies, it was discovered that carboxy methyl cellulose CMC had a marked antiredeposition effect on cotton textiles. CMC is a high polymer anionic cellulose ether which has a good antiredeposition effect in concentra tions of as low as 0.5 1.0 of the detergent composition.It is assumed that this antiredeposition effect depends upon a selective adsorption to the cotton fibres by hydrogen bonding, whereafter the negatively charged dirt particles are repelled by the carboxylate groups in theCMC. By the introduction of CMC into detergent compositions, it can be said that the problems inherent in antiredeposition have been solved as far as cotton textiles are concerned. On the other hand, CMC is practically inactive on synthetic textiles for the prevention of greying or redeposition. CMC normally displays no antiredeposition effect whatever on the most widespread synthetic fibre, polyester and with the popular mixed textiles of the type polyester cotton, this antiredeposition effect is slight, unless the proportion of cotton is very high in the textile. Concurrently with the increasing use of synthetic fibres, greying has become a steadily more serious problem in the washing process. Much effort has been devoted to attempting to find antiredeposition agents which are effective on synthetic textiles, primarily of polyester fibres. A great number of different types of polymers has been tested as antiredeposition agent and, in some cases, this has led to the development of commercially viable products. Thus, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP polyvinyl alcohol PVA , as well as non ionic polyesters and cellulose ethers have been used to a certain extent. In all cases, this is a matter of high molecular chain molecules, along the lines of CMC.However, none of the hitherto produced polymers has displayed the desired antiredeposition effect, and their use is very restricted in domestic detergents in Europe. As an example of the prior art technology, reference might be made to Norwegian Patent Specification No. 122,199 which relates to a washing and cleaning agent which contains, as antiredeposition agent, from 0.1 20 by weight, cal√ßulKteS E tlie total weight of the cleaning agent, water soluble salts of carboxyl group containing poly esters.The ratio of carboxyl groups to hydroxyl groups is, there, greater than 1, and the polyester has a high degree of polymerisation. In the present invention, it has now surprisingly proved that certain low molecular molecular weight 1000 ,multi functional esters have an antiredeposition effect on polyester fibre which is fully on a par with the effect obtained by CMC on cotton. The esters are prepared from multi functional acids and bases, and the condensation is arrested at an early stage in order to keep the molecular weight down. A typical ester compound according to the invention contains from 1 to 6 acid units bonded with alcohol units, and a preferred compound contains from 1 to 3 acid units. The compounds according to the invention are further characterized in that the number of free hydroxyl groups mol is from 1 to 3, preferably from 2 to 3, and in that the number of free carboxyl groups mol is from 0.1 to 0.5, preferably from 0.2 to 0.4.Thus the ratio of free hydroxyl groups free carboxyl groups in the finished compound is from 2 to 30, preferably from 5 to 15. The concentration of free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the compounds according to the invention controls, int. al., the hydrophility and the hydrogen bonding capacity of the compound and would seem to have a decisive effect on its antiredeposition properties. If the above disclosed range limits are exceeded in one direction or the other, the effect would be drastically lirpaired. The physical explanation for this phenomenon is not yet known. Further characteristic features of the present invention are apparent from the appended claims. The multifunctional esters according to the invention are manufactured in accordance with prior art technology please see, for example, D.H. Solomon, The Chemistry of OrganicFilm Formers, Krieger Publ., New York 1977 . The starting materials comprise aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic divalent, trivalent and tetravalent carboxylic acids, as well as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic divalent, trivalent and tetravalent alcohols. Examples of applicable acids are ortho, iso and terephthalic acid, tri and pyromellitic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, cyclohexane tricarboxylic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Naturally, reactive derivates of these acids ay also be used, such as anhydrides, esters and acid chlorides. Preferred acids and acid derivates are phthalic acid anhydride, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, maleic acid and trimellitic acid. Examples of applicable alcohols are ethylene glycol, 1,2 propanediol, diethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6 hexanediol, neopentyl glycol pivallic acid ester, timethylol profane, glycerol and pentaerythritol. Preferred alcohols are ethylene glycol, 1,2 propanediol and diethylene glycol. The multi functional ester according to the invention is used in combination with normal detergent raw materials such as phosphate, zeolite, silicate, surfactant, perborate, percarbonate, soda and sulphate. It can be used as sole antiredeposition agent or in combination with other such agents, for example CMC. Normally, the ester constitutes 0.1 2 z of the detergent composition. In the manufacture of detergent, the ester according to the invention may be introduced in a variety of manners, among which mention might be made of a direct admixture to the detergent slurry before spray drying of the slurry in the preparation of the detergent b spraying in the warm state onto dry detergent c dissolution or emulsification in water or organic solvent, whereafter the solution or emulsion is added to the above tioned slurg or the spray dried detergent d absorption on an inorganic carrier, for example phosphate, zeolite, silicate, soda, bicarbonate, sulphate,which is then added to the abovementioned slurry or the finished detergent e admixture in organic compounds, for example polyethylene glycol and stearic acidr whereafter the mixture is added to the finished detergent f admixture in a fluid detergent composition, possibly after dissolution in organic solvent or emulsification in water. The examples below are intended to illustrate the present invention without restriction thereof.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of compound 1. A mixture of isophthalic acid 120 g , trimellitic acid anhydride 140 g , ethylene glycol 70 g and diethylene glycol 280 g was heated at 210 220 C under nitrogen gas. The reaction was followed by means of acid number determination. When the acid number had reached the value which approximately corresponded to the formation of diethers of the included acids, the reaction mixture was cooled. Analysis of the thus obtained compound showed that the number of free hydroxyl groups mol was 2.0 and the number of free carboxyl groups mol was 0.27.EXAMPLE 2Preparation of compound 2. A mixture of phthalic acid anhydride 269 g and propylene glycol 380 g was heated at 180 190 C for 5 h under nitrogen gas. The reaction mixture was cooled to 150 C, whereafter trimellitic acid anhydride 120 g was added. The reaction was allowed to continue first at 150 0C, thereafter at a higher temperature l80 2000C , until the acid number 50 had been reached. An analysis showed that the number of free hydroxyl groups mol was 2.0 and the number of free carboxyl groups mol was 0.25. EXAMPLE 3Preparation of compound 3. A mixture of maleic acid anhydride 30 g , ethylene glycol 180 g , pentaerythritol 150 g and 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid 300 g was heated at 210 220 0C for 4 h under nitrogen gas. After cooling to 1500C, pyromellitic acid anhydride 30 g was added, whereafter the reaction was allowed to continue at 1600C until the acid, number 50 had been reached. An analysis of the thus obtained product showed that the number of free hydroxyl groups mol was 2.88 and the number of free carboxyl groups mol was 0.26.EXAMPLE 4Preparation of compound 4 A mixture of maleic acid anhydride 75 g , ethylene glycol 240 g , trimethylolpropane 105 g and 1,4 cyclo hexane dicarboxylic acid 300 g was heated at 210 2200C under nitrogen gas.
