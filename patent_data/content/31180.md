# METHOD OF GROWING A DOPED III V ALLOY LAYER BY MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY AND A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE COMPRISING A SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE BEARING AN EPITAXIAL LAYER OF A DOPED III V ALLOY GROWN BY SUCH A METHOD

## Abstract
A method of growing III V alloy layers by a molecular beam epitaxy process. Difficulties have been experienced when growing doped III V alloy layers by conventional molecular beam epitaxy processes due to the introduction of electron or hole traps which impair the electrical and optical properties of the alloy. Such III V alloy layers are used in making microwave and opto electronic semiconductor devices such as field effect transistors and laser diodes. In the present invention, an epitaxial layer 48 of a doped III V alloy is grown on a semiconductor substrate 1 by plac ing the substrate 1 in a vacuum chamber 3 , reducing the pressure in the vacuum chamber 3 to below atmospheric pressure, maintaining the substrate 1 at a temperature inthe range from 300 to 500 C, and directing a plurality of molecular beams containing the constituent elements of the doped III V alloy and a molecular beam of lead onto the heated substrate 1 . The magnitude of the lead flux is sufficient to form and maintain a presence of from 5 to 20 of a monolayer of lead on the growth surface..
