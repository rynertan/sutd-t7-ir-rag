# Method of manufacturing a high resistance layer having a low temperature coefficient of resistance and semiconductor device having such high resistance layer.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a resistive layer with a low temperature coefficient of resistance. The method comprises the steps of providing a semi insulating film 6 comprising silicon crystallites embedded in a silicon dioxide matrix, preferably made by chemical vapor decomposition of a mixture of sane SiH4 and vitrous oxide N2O . The film is at least partly converted into a resistive layer 2 by implanting ions of arsenic or phosphorus in the film. The film is heated at about 900 DEG C and provided with electrode regions 3, 4 .
