# TUBE FOR HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A tube 10 for a heat exchanger is provided in one outer side face with impressions 11 which form raised portions on the inner side of the tube 10 and have a length exceeding one fourth of the circumference of the tube, and which make an angle α₁ of at least 10 , preferably 30 40 , with the longi tudinal axis 1a of the tube. In its opposite outer side face, the tube 10 has similar impressions 12 making a larger angle α₂ with the longitudinal axis of the tube, preferably α₁ 90 . The tube 10 preferably has oval cross section with the impressions 11, 12 provided in the broad sides thereof. Such an oval tube 10 is readily manufactured by a pressing operation between press plates whose pressing surfaces are provided with ridges for making said impressions 11, 12 , the spacing of the ridges, their inclination relative to the lon gitudinal axis 1a of the tube 10 to be pressed, their location on one of the press plates with respect to the location on the other press plate, and their height over the press plate surface are determined on the basis of the properties pressure and velocity of the medium to be conducted through the tube 10 .
