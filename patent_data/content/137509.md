# ELECTRIC FUSE

## Abstract
An electric fuse 10 includes a tube 12 of insulating material with first and second open ends 14, 16 . Metallic or electrically conducting end caps 20, 24 are placed on each of the first and second ends. A fuse element 18 is mounted with the tube in electrical contact with the end caps. The fuse elements includes an elongated body defined by a plurality of heavy portions 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62 and a plurality of weak spots 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 . Each weak spot is located between adjacent heavy portions. The weak spots are linear fusible portions integrally connected to adjacent heavy portions and are transverse to an axis extending along the length of the element. Each heavy portion includes first and second ends. A first adjacent heavy portion is connected at a first end of a weak spot and a second adjacent heavy portion is connected to a second end of the weak spot, such that the first ends of adjacent heavy portions are transversely offset from each other.
