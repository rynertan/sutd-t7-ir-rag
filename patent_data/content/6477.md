# Device for controlling the transmission of data between a data transmitting control unit and a data recording controller for serial recording.

## Abstract
The invention concerns the transmission of data from a transmitting control unit to a disk file controller through an interface cable the length of which may vary from one installation to another thereby varying the propagation delay through the cable from one installation to another. A SYNC IN signal from an AND gate 26 of the disk file controller is used to request data from the control unit. A SYNC OUT signal is returned by the control unit. A clock generator supplies bit timing signals BIT 0 to BIT 7 to a selector 24 and the selector issues a gating signal to an AND gate 31 to generate a SYNC IN signal at a selected one of the bit times as determined by a byte of control data contained in a register 22 . The bit time is selected to account for the propagation delay of the interface cable such that the resultant SYNC OUT signal is returned at a desired bit time appropriate for recording data at a pre defined location on a moving recording disk.
