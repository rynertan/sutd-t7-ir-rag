## Description
The invention concerns an apparatus for controlling the light of the headlights of a vehicle by controlling the current or voltage of the lamps of the headlightsBackground of the inventionDisability glare and discomfort glare have been studied for many decades. In road or street traffic, adaptation glare as a special kind of disability glare plays an important role. Two situations are well known to motorists the abrupt decrease of illumination when driving at daytime into a tunnel or the disturbing light beam of oncoming or approaching cars at nighttime.Many attempts have been made to overcome the disadvantages of adaptation glare, in particular to eliminate the adaptive glare in night traffic. On principle, there are three methods for decreasing adaptation glare. The first method is to increase the average luminous intensity of road illumination. This, however, can only be put into effect by increasing the number of streetlamps. By doing so, the streetlamps themselves will cause a glare effect. The second method is to influence the light beam of the headlights of the cars directly or indirectly.Lightabsorbing spectacles have been made for this purpose without having had a decisive positive effect. A third method lies in the use of polarized light. It is, however, impossible to eliminate the indirect glare by reflections of puddles or smooth road surfaces by the use of polarized light.Prior ArtPrior art control means for controlling the intensity or direction of light of the headlights in a vehicle simply switch over from the long distance light emission to the antidazzle light emission, if the brightness outside the vehicle passes a certain threshold, and they switch back to the long distance light, if the brightness is falling below this treshold.The disadvantage of these prlor art control means lies in the fact that the abrupt transition from high beam to low beam causes a glare which is to be avoided.ProblemIt is an object of the present invention to avoid any glare and any manual actions during driving and or stopping and or starting a vehicle.SolutionThe above mentioned problem is solved by the invention by either controlling the light as a function of brightness outside the vehicle or as a function of the state of motion of the vehicle.Advantageous effects in the inventionOne of the advantages of the invention is that the headlights of a vehicle, particularly of a car, can be adjusted according to the intensity of the headlights of cars coming accross and the brightness of the environment in front of the car to maintain the proper brightness condition and prevent the glare or blindness effect when abrupt variation of brightness condition occurs.That means the invention adjusts the brightness variation to the driver instead of the driver having to adjust his eyes to the brightness variation. Another advantage lies in the fact that the headlights will automatically be switched off when the vehicle does not move. A further advantage of the invention lies in the fact that the motorist can always pay attention to the mere driving, since he is not averted from doing this by carrying out various actions such as turning on and off the high beam. Particularly in the dark area, if the intensity of a car coming across is more powerful than a prescribed intensity the headlights will flash on sufficient beam to help the eyes adjust to the brightness variation quickly. Also, according to this invention, the headlight can be changed into assistant light due to the street lamps or lamps of the stores.Still, the automatic controller of the headlight according to this invention operates the headlight to the highest intensity when driving in a dark area. When driving in a city, the bright light or high beam will automatically be switched off.

Also, a feedback resistor 49 is provided which connects the output of the amplifier 48 with the positive input of same.The output of this amplifier 48 is further connected to the cathode of a zener diode 50 as well as to one terminal of a capacitor 51. The other terminal of capacitor 51 is connected to the cathode of a diode 52 and to the anode of a diode 53. The arode of the above mentioned zener diode 50 is connected to a re resistor 54 which, in turn, is connected to the basis or control electrode of a transistor 55, the emitter of which is earthconnected and the collector of which is connected to a resistor 56. This latter transistor 56 is connected to the output of the integrated circuit 40. A capacitor 57 which is also connected to the output of circuit 40 is connected to earth.As mentioned above, the collector of transistor 55 is connected to resistor 56. Besides this it is also connected to a capacitor 59 which is connected to the anode of a diode 59 and to the cathode of a diode 60. The cathodes of the diodes 53 and 59 are connected to each other and they are also connected to an earth connected capacitor 61 as well as to the resistors 62, 63. Whereas the latter resistor 63 is connected to an earth connected resistor 64, the resistor 62 is connected to the control electrode of a transistor 65, the emitter of which is connected to the control electrode of a transistor 66. The collectors of both transistors 65, 66 are connected to each other. The emitter of transistors 66 is connected to a resistor 67 which, in turn, is connected to earth.The collector of transistor 65 is connected to the anode of a diode 68, the cathode of which is connected to the input of integrated circuit 40 and, thus, to one terminal of a coil 69 and the positive pole of the battery.This coil 69 is part of a relay having contacts 70 73. Contact 71 is connected to a capacitor 74 which is connected to the cathode of thyristor 23. Contact 73 is connected to the resistances 75, 76 of headlight lamps. Similarly, contact 71 is connected to other resistances 77 , 78 of headlight lamps. One terminal of each of the resistances 76 78 is connected to one terminal of each other resistance thus establishing a junction which is, in turn, earthconnected.As can be understood from Fig. 1, a first part of the circuit is constituted by lens 1, transitors 4,5,17,18,field effect transistor 6 and integrated circuit 11. This circuit is adapted to sense the ambient light and turn off or turn on the long distance beams by means of a relay 20,22,24 If an approaching car has reached a distance of 200 300m, the upward light is changend into subsidiary light.A second part of the circuit is constituted by the photosensitive element 26, transistors 26,28,29, unijunction transistors 31 and thyristors 23, 24. This part of the circuit has the function of subsidiary lithting in order ot adjust driver s eyes to surroundings.A third part of the circuit is constituted by the integrated circuit 48, the transistors 55, 65, 66 and the relay 69, 70 73. This part of the circuit has the function of turning off the headlight when the vehicle is started or stopped.The lens 1 is arranged adjacent to the photo tansister 2 in order to supply this tranistor 2 with the intensity of radiation. The voltage produced by this transistor 2 is divided through transistor 2, variable resistor 3, resistor 4 and 5 and thus influences transistor 4. By means of transistors4 and 5 electric current is supplied to the gate of field effect transistor 6 which, in turn, sends injection signals to the integrated circuit 11 through the variable resistor 10, resistor 8 and resistor 5.The output signal of the integrated circuit 11 flows into the base of transitor 17 through the protective resistor 16. Then the relay 20,22,24 becomes magnetised and contact 80 is seperated from contact 22 and connected to contact 24. Thus, the downward light of lamps resistors 75, 76 is turned on by a corresponding supply of electric current to contact 73 of relay 69, 70 73 When no light is detected by lens 1, the resistance of photo transistor 2 is nearly infinite. Therefore, no voltage of the resistor 3 is supplied to transitor 4, and supplement of electric current cannot be obtained through transistors 5,6,17,18 and integrated circuit 11. Accordingly relay 20, 22, 80, 24 urns on upward headlight 77,78 which is related by means of an electric connection to thyrister 23, whereby the contacts of this relay are changed.The intensity of radiation is controlled by the variable resistor 3.When the photo transistor 2 accepts light beams and when contact 80 in relay 20,22,80,24 returns to 22, the lens 25 of photo transistor 26 brings together beams at the photo transistor. The photo transistor 26 sends much electric current ot the base of the transistors, step by step according to the intensity of the increasing light. The emitter of transistor 28 sends a high current to the base of transistor 29, while the emitter of transistor 29 sends a high current to the gate of the unijunction transistor 31. In that time, a great amount of charge and discharge electricity capacitor 30 comes out at the gate of the unijunction transistor 31 and at resistor 33. The voltage charged by capacitor 30 discharge and an electric current flows to the gate of the thyrister 34 according to pulse signals.After counteract pulses have been descended between both extrems of resister 33, discharging pulse signals come out between both ex ems of resistor 33, through capacitor 35 and resistor 39, pass the pulse signals through the gate of the thyristor. At this time, the cathode of thyristor 23 sends electric power through relay 20,22, 80, 24. Capacitor 38 which is used for counteraction in order to counteract pulse signals which are devided when relay 20,20,80,24, is converted. The anode of thyrister 23 turns in upward light on starting and cuts electric current to upward light and does not send the source of electric power to resistance 77,78.The integrated circuit 37 re creates static electricity voltage for suitable supply of the source of electric power.The variable resistor 27 is a resistor for regulating the intensity of radiation, whereas resistor 32 is a protective resistor with respect to unijunction resistor 31.At the time when the vehicle is stopped and if no intensity of radiation is detected on the light sensitive transistor 26, the two contacts 22 and 80 of the relay tough each other . As a consequence resistors 75,76,77,78 turn on at the same time and the visual field keeps wide.The circuit which is constituted by means of the integrated circuit 48 together with the transistors 55,65,66 is able to turn on the headlight on starting and to turn off the headlight when stopping.If the signal is generated in a Schmitt trigger constituted by the light emitting diode 44, the Dhoto sensitive transistor and the circuit 48, a globular shaped wave is generated which is changed through diodes 60, 59 and which is charged in capacitor 61. The globular shaped wave is not discharged and charges capacitor 61 through capacitor 51 and diodes 52, 53. Upward light 77,78 and downward light 75,76 would be controlled by changing or not changing contacts 71 to 81 and contact 73 to 82 according to discharging through re resistor 63 and variable resistor 64. The transistors 65,66 are magnetizing the relay 69, 70 73, 81, 82. At the time of stonning, no signal is generated at transistor 43 and no globular shaped wave is generated at the integrated circuit 48. No voltage is sent to transistors 65,66 or to relay 69, 70 73,81,82 and, consequentely, this relay is not magnetized. So the source of electic power is not send to resistors 75,76,77,78. Resistor 42 is a protective resistor for the light emitting diode 41, whereas the variable resistor 44 is resistance for correction of the globular shaped wave. The resistors 46,47 are classification resistors for setting up a datum point, whereas resister 49 is a resistance for correction of hysteresis, and resister 54 is a base protection resistance for transistor 55. Resistor 56 is a load resistor for transistor 55, whereas resistor 64 is a resistance for regulating of delayed time.Resistor 62 is an emitter stabilizing resistance of the transistor 66. Diode 68 is a protective diode.Fig. 2 illustrates a circuit using CdS sensors instead any photo transistors. At that time when the CdS sensor receives high illumination and if it is connected to capacitor C3 and to the gate of the unijunction resistor through variable resister VR1, the resistance will be dimimished and charge capacitor C3 . The capacity of charging or discharging is larger with high beam and it is smaller with low beam through unijunction resistor UIT1 and resister R3. L1 and PL2 are turned on or turned off respectively.Fig. 2 shows two lamps PL1, PL2 being connected to the contacts a, b respectively of a relay Ry. This relay Ry can be actuated by a coil Co which is connected in parallel to a diode D5 and with one of its ends to collectors of the transistors TR2 and TR3.The other end of this coil Co as well as the cathode of the diode D5 are connected to one terminal of a battery B and to the output of on integrated circuit IC1, the input of which is connected to a capacitor C1. Both, the capacitor C1 as well as the integrated circuit IC1 are connected to earth. The emitter of transistorTR2 is connected to the basis of transistor TR3, whereas the emitter of transistor TR3 is connected via resistor Rg to earth. A resistorR8 and a varialbe resistor VR2 are series connected with one of their terminals, whereas the other end of the variable resister VR2 is connected to earth and the other end of resistor R8 is connected to the basis of transistor TR2. To this basis of transitor TR2 are also connected a capacitor C4, the cathode of a diode D2 and the cathode of a diode D4.The other end of the capacitor C4 is earth connected. The anode of the diode D4 is connected to the cathode of the diode D3, the anode of which is earth connected.A capacitor C3 is connected to the anode of the diode D4, as well as to the cathode of diode D3 the other terminal of this capacitor C3 being connected to the collector of a transistorTR1, the emitter of which is earth connected. Also, the collector of transistor TR1 is connected the a capacitor C2 as well as to the anode of diode D2, to the cathode of diode D1 and to a resistorR7. The other terminal of this resistor R7 is connected to the capacitor C1 and to the integrated circuit IC1. The basis of the above mentioned transistor TR4 is connected to the anode of a zener diode Z1 the cathode of which is connected to capacitorC2, to a resistor R5 and to the output of an integrated circuitIC2. Resistor R5 is a feedback resistor connecting the output of the integrated circuit IC2 with the positive input of the this integrated circuit IC2. The negative input of intergrated circuitIC2 is connected to the junction between resistors R3 and R4 which form a voltage divider, whereas the positive input of integrated circuit IC2 is connected to the junction between the collector of transistor OIT, the emitter of which connected to earth and to the other terminal of resistor R4 as well to the cathode of a light emitting diode LED. The collector of transistor PRT is also connected to resistor R2 which, in turn, is series connected to a variable resistor VR1 is connected to a resistor R1 the other terminal of which is connected to the anode of the light emitting diode LED.
