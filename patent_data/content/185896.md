# Modular electrical conductor system.

## Abstract
A modular electrical conductor system for electrical wiring including one or more discrete elongated generally rectilinear track or carrier members and a plurality of modular electrical elements which are selectively connectible with the carrier members to establish a selected electrical circuit, the various carrier members and modular elements having preassembled electrical conductors carried therein such that ends of the conductors are adapted for mating electrical connection while being continually shielded from contact by an installer. The modular electrical elements include modular switch and or receptacle elements having internal switch means operative to enable selective connection of internal conductors so as to vary circuit configurations to create at least one primary circuit and selective auxiliary circuits, each modular switch and receptacle element defining four quadrant oriented multiple conductor connector sites enabling the switch and receptacle elements to be connected to elongated carrier track members. The various prewire modular circuit components are preferably coded in a manner to enable easy selective connection in various circuit configuration by a person untrained in electrical circuitry.
