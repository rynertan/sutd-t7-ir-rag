# Axially contractable actuator.

## Abstract
An actuator has a first connection point 4 and a second connection point 18 at opposite ends and is contractable along an axis 38 extending between the connection points. The actuator has at least one hollow enclosure 2 with an opening 18 for admitting a pressurized fluid. A simultaneously radially expandable, axially contractable constraining means 28 coop erates with the enclosure 2 . The contraining means converts radial expansion of the actuator into axial contraction when pressurized fluid is admitted into the enclosure. In a preferred form, the contraining means comprises a network of nonstretch able, flexible tension links.
