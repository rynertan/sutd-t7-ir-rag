# Novel polypeptide and production thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a novel polypeptide which is at least equivalent in biological activity to IFN tau and a method of producing the same. The polypeptide exhibits antiviral, antitumor, antiprolifractive and immunopotentiating activities and hardly dimerizes and polymerizes, therefore, it can be used advantageously as a drug.
