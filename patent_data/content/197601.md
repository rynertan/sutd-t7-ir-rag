# Method of forming a patterned photopolymer coating on a printing roller and also a printing roller with patterned photopolymer coating.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of forming of a patterned photopolymer coating on a printing roller 1 in which a photopolymer coating 2 , present on said roller 1 , and covered by a light sensitive intermediate layer 3 is exposed in a first stage to form an image of opaque and translucent parts in said intermediate layer 3 . Subsequently the photopolymer layer 2 is exposed via the image formed in the intermediate layer 3 , after which the photopolymer layer 2 is developed. Between abovementioned exposures, in case of relative ly thick, flexible, photopolymer, a period is waited to ensure that depressed parts of the photopolymer layer 2 have returned to their original state. The invention also relates to a printing roller thus obtained.
