# Differential type protective relay.

## Abstract
In a differential type protective relay actuated to gener ate a signal necessary for the protection of a bus 1 of an electric power system when a troubled current has flown through the bus, a gapped first transformer 13 4, 23 4 is used to receive an output from a current transformers 12, 22 which are adapted to detect each current in the bus. Each output of a first detection element, which is actuated when the output of the first transformer is higher than a preset level, is fed out to the exterior only when a value obtained by subtracting the sum of the maximum of the output of the first transformer and the value of a signal obtained by shifting the phase of the output through a predetermined angle from the value of a signal obtained by subjecting the output of the first transformer to full wave transformation is equal to or lower than a preset value.
