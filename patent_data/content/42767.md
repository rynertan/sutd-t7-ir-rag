# Refractory, heat insulating articles.

## Abstract
A shaped, refractory, heat insulating article comprises particulate refractory material, a water soluble borate com pound and, as binder, starch and a urea formaldehyde resin. The starch helps provide suitable transverse strength, the resin protects the starch from moisture and promotes good surface properties and the borate compound enhances the transverse strength and the integrity of the article at high temperature. The article e.g. a slab is useful for lining metallurgical vessels e.g. tundishes.
