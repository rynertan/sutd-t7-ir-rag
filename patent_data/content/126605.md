# QUICK RECOVERY HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER

## Abstract
A quick recovery heat pump water heater 10, 100, 200 includes a water storage tank with first 16 and second 18 tank portions, and sensing means 24, 26 for indicating the demand for hot water in the tank portions. A water pump 54 and an external heat source 60 are provided. Control means 64 responsive to an indication from the sensing means of a demand for hot water in the first tank portion initially estab lishes communication of the first tank portion with the pump and external heat source and turns them on. The control means then responds to an indication from the sensing means that the demand for hot water in the first tank portions has been satis fied and establishes communication of the second tank portion with the pump and external heat source. Finally, the control means is responsive to an indication from the sensing means that the demand for hot water in the second tank portion has been satisfied and turns off the pump and external heat source.
