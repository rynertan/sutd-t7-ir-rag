## Description
A self closing propellant charge packageThe invention relates to a self closing propellant charge package for use with a gravity operated loading device for a powder actuated tool a tubular body, having one end at least partially closed, the other end being open, and having a portion, adjacent to the open end, which is integrally formed with a plurality of deformable, charge retaining nodes adapted for reformation between a first, undeformed, condition, wherein passage of charges is prevented, and a second, deformed, condition admitting of ready passage of charges. The package is adapted for telescoping emplacement on a projecting tubular loading port insert on the loading device, whereby the nodes are displaced, allowing the charges into the insert and, thence, into the loading device.In order to assume the double function of packaging and loading, such a device must retain the charges when it is not mounted on the tool, and let them come out when it is mounted A package, assuming these functions, is known in accordance with the prior art portion ofClaim 1 United States Patent 4,199,093 wherein a tubular body has an end deformed, as by an elastic band, to retain propellant charges therein, the deformation being cancelled to provide for passage of the charges. Such packages are seen to suffer, however, in that it is necessary to provide slits or cut outs in the package wall to facilitate the end deformation and also to provide and emplace the elastic band.These manufacturing steps unacceptably increase the cost of what is generally treated as a consumable or disposable item.It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide a propellant charge package, of the type described, which may be produced at minimal cost. This is accomplished, in general, by a tubular propellant charge package having one end at least partially closed, the other end being open, and having a portion, adjacent to the open end, which is integrally formed with a plurality of deformable, charge retaining nodes, the nodes being adapted for reformation between a first, undeformed condition, wherein passage of charges is prevented, and a second, deformed, condition admitting of ready passage of charges.More specifically, the package is adapted for telescoping emplacement on a projecting tubular loading port insert on a loading device, whereby the nodes are displaced to assume the second condition, allowing charges to pass into the loading port insert and, thence, into the loading device.One way of carrying out the present invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal view, partly in cross section, of an embodiment of the present invention, Figure 2 is an enlarged end view of the embodiment of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a view of the invention of Figure mounted on a powder actuated tool.Figures 1 3 show a package including a substantially tubular body 1, adapted to receive a plurality of propellant charges 9 in serial alignment, having a closed end 2 and an open end 4, through which the charges 9 are inserted and dispensed. The body 1 is formed of a resilient material, such as low density polyethylene.In the vicinity of the open end 4, tube 1 is formed with three integral, deformable, charge retaining nodes 5, symmetrically disposed about the periphery of the body 1 and equidistant from the open end 4. The nodes 5 are each defined by a pair of intersecting planes 6 and 7 respectively, inclined approximately 15 and 40 relative to the longitudinal axis of the body 1, and are adapted for reformation between a first, undeformed, condition, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, wherein passage of charges 9 through the body 1 is prevented, and a second, deformed condition, as shown in Figure 3, admitting of ready passage of charges 9. As will be more fully explained later, the nodes 5 may be deformed, as seen in Figure 3, by telescopic emplacement of the package on an openended, tubular loading port insert 17 carried by a loading device 10.The insert 17 includes a nose portion 17a, adapted to be inserted into the body 1, the terminus of the nose portion 17a being defined by a shoulder 17b adapted to limit the extent of such insertion. The length of the nose portion 17a is slightly less than the distance between the open end 4 of the body 1 and the lines of intersection 5a of the pairs of planes 6 and 7. The distal end of the nose portion 17a may be provided with outside and inside bevels 23 and 24 respectively for facilitating the introduction of the insert 17 into the body 1 and that of the charges 9 into the insert 17.The insert 17 is further provided with a screw thread 17c for attachment to the loading device 10.The loading device 10 comprises a support 11, formed with two arms 12 and 13, the arm 12 being continued in its upper part by a sleeve 16, and a member 14 for transfering the charges into the tool combustion chamber.Member 14 is preferably pivotally mounted about a pin which is integral with support 11, for movement in a plane perpendicular to the barrel of the tool. A closure plate 15, for member 14, is pivotally mounted between member 14 and arm 13 of support 11. Sleeve 16 comprises the insert 17, the nose portion 17a of which projects towards the outside of sleeve 16 and bores 18, 19 and 20, each having a diameter substantially equal to the outside diameter of the charges 9, formed respectively in insert 17, sleeve 16 and transfer member 14, in such manner that the charges 9 may descend by gravity from the body 1 into the transfer member 14.When the nose portion 17a of the insert 17 is being introduced into the open end 4 of the body 1, against the action of the resilient nodes 5, the later are deformed, being urged radially outwardly to positions approximating the cylindrical bulk of the body 1, whereby ready passage of the charges 9 is permitted. The body 1, which is in abutment against the forward face of shoulder 17b, is maintained upon insert 17 by the constriction provided by the deformed nodes 5. The charges 9 may then be put in position in the transfer member 14 of the device 10, from the package, by gravity.The package is thus seen to provide a holding function for the charges when it is not mounted on the loading device 10, and a release function when it is mounted on the device.Moreover, when the package is disengaged from the device 10, the nodes 5 , which are no longer held by the nose portion 17a of the insert 17, resiliently resume their initial position as seen in Figure 1, holding the charges 9 within the body 1.It will be noted that it is after an operation similar to that of mounting the package on the insert 17, that the package is initially filled with charges 9.
