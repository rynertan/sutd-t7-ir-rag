# A composite driving belt with transverse elements provided with mutual coupling means.

## Abstract
A driving belt of substantially trapezium shaped cross section for application on V shaped pulleys, comprising an endless carrier in the form of at least one metal band and a pluarilty of transverse elements abutting against each other with the head sides and slidably mounted on the carrier. The transverse elements are bevelled radially inwardly un derneath a tilting line 4 for enabling the bending of the driving belt. For mutual centering the transverse elements are provided with coupling means in the form of a pro jection s 6 and a recess es 7 at the head sides. These coupling means are situated at a relatively large dis tance above the tilting line of the transverse elements.
