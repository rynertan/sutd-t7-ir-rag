# Use of a thiazide diuretic for the manufacture of a non diuretic antihypertensive medicament.

## Abstract
Antihypertension action is achieved without diuresis by administration of a thiazide diuretic in an amount which while being sufficient to achieve antihypertension is insuffi cient to achieve diuresis. Such administration in a non diuretic amount is effected in 4 8 consecutive hourly doses to achieve reduction of blood pressure without high urine output. The invention further relates to complexes of thiazides with mixed cation anion exchange resins, to insolu ble basic metal hydroxy thiazide salts, the salts of thiazide with calcium disodium edetate or disodium edetate, to molecular complexes of thiazides with long chain polymers such as hydroxy alkyl cellulose polymers, carboxy methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone, to beta adrenergic block ing amine thiazide salts and to amiloride thiazide salts.
