# MOS IMAGING DEVICE WITH MONOCHROME COLOR COMPATIBILITY AND SIGNAL READOUT VERSATILITY

## Abstract
A monochrome or color imager having interlaced, non interlaced or pseudo interlaced readout utilizing pixels ar ranged in groups forming equilateral triangles which are in terleaved. Separate shift registers driven by different clock signals are located on each side of the rectangular array and are coupled to alternating row address lines and different groups of column lines in the array. The clock signals driving each shift register can be controlled to select monochrome or color operation in one of the above noted modes of read out.
