# Method and apparatus for controlling knocking of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
Disclosed are method and apparatus for controlling knocking of an internal combustion engine by retarding 106 an ignition timing in accordance with a knocking intensity of detected knocking 105 and advancing 202 205 the ignition timing at a predetermined velocity after the ignition timing has been retarded. When the detected knocking intensity is below a predetermined level, it is regarded that the knocking has not occurred and the retardation is inhibited 105 .
