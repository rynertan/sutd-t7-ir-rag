# PROCESS FOR THE TRANSFER OF GENETIC MATERIAL INTO ACTINOMYCETE CELLS, PREPARED CELLS AND METHOD OF CULTURING THESE CELLS AND ISOLATING A METABOLITE

## Abstract
A process for the transfer of genetic material into Actinomycete cells, which comprises entrapment of the genetic material within a lipid vesicle and thereafter fusing the lipid vesicle with an osmotically fragile Actinomycete cell.
