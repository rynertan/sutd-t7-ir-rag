# Single development step, dual layer photoresist photolithographic process.

## Abstract
A photoresist photolithographic process is disclosed which provides for a single development step to develop a dual layer photoresist for lift off, reactive ion etching, or ion implantation processes requiring a precise aperture size at the top of the photoresist layer. The process involves the deposition of two composition ally similar layers, with the first layer having the character istic of being soluble in a developer after exposure to light and baking, and the second layer having the characteristic of being insoluble in the same developer after having been exposed to light and baked. With these two distinct charac teristics for the two layers of photoresist, the effective aper ture for windows in the composite photoresist can be tightly controlled in its cross sectional dimension in the face of large variations in the developer concentration and devel opment time.
