# LINKAGE MECHANISM FOR SUPERCHARGER SYSTEM

## Abstract
Disclosed is an induction or supercharger system 16 for a piston engine 10 having a Roots type blower 14 for supercharging an air fuel mixture from a carburetor 12 having primary and secondary throttle valves 64 and 66 . The induction system defines a naturally aspirated flow path, a recirculation flow path, and a supercharger flow path. The flow paths are controlled by valves 18 and 20 . Valves 18, 64 and 66 are moved between their respective opened and closed positions by a linkage mechanism 44 including a lever 72 and linkage assemblies 74 and 76 . The linkage assemblies include resilient means 88 and 102 which respectively move the throttle valves open and the valve 18 closed. Valve 20 is opened in response to a differential pressure across the naturally aspirated flow path and the supercharger flow path.
