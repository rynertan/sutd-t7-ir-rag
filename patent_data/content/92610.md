# METHODS FOR PARTITIONING MAINFRAME INSTRUCTION SETS TO IMPLEMENT MICROPROCESSOR BASED EMULATION THEREOF

## Abstract
Methods of applying LSI and microprocessors to the design of microprocessor based LSI implementation of mainframe processors are described. The mainframe in struction set is partitioned into two or more subsets, each of which can be implemented by a microprocessor having special on chip microcode or by a standard off the shelf microprocessor running programs written for that purpose. Alternatively, one or more of the subsets can be im plemented by a single microprocessor. In addition, a subset of the partitioned instruction set can be implemented by emulating software, by off chip vertical or horizontal micro code, or by primitives. But, however partitioning is im plemented, the end result thereof is to keep the critical flow paths, associated with the most frequently used instruction subset, as short as possible by constraining them to a single chip. For each subset of the instructions that requires high performance, the corresponding microprocessor chip con tains the data flow path and all elements, including registers, necessary for the execution of that subset as well as the microcode that controls execution. In some applications, a subset of the instructions that does not require high performance is implemented with a critical path that crosses several chip boundaries and is, therefore, considerably slower. The application of this method requires partitioning that makes each identified high performance subset execut able on one microprocessor in the current state of technolo gy, a way to quickly pass control back and forth between all of the microprocessors, a suitable way to pass data back and forth between all of the microprocessors, and a technology in which it is ecomonically feasible to have several copies of a complex data flow and control store mechanism.
