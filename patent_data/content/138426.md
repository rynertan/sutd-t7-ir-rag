## Description
Frost sensitive agricultural crops may be damaged by ice formation within their tissues. While water within the tissues may be supercooled to 5 C and below, the presence of certain natural epiphytic bacteria on the plant surface can promote the nucleation and formation of ice crystals at temperatures slightly below 0 C. Such ice nucleation capable INA Many approaches have been developed for reducing such frost injury. Methods such as the use of wind machines to mix warm air from above with the cold air near the ground, the burning of fossil fuels to directly heat the air surrounding the crop plants, and the pumping of large amounts of water to release latent heat on or near crop plants are not highly effective, are costly, and can adversely affect the environment. Alternate methods for frost control are actively being sought. One effective approach relies on the reduction of the natural epiphytic population of ice nucleation capable bacteria on the crop plants. Approaches include the use of bactericides, typically antibiotics, to reduce the total bacterial population and the use of antagonistic, ice nucleation deficient INA It would thus be desirable to develop INA U.S. Patent Nos. 4,045,910 and 4,161,084 describe the use of ice nucleation deficient microorganisms to inhibit frost injury. See also, copending application Serial No. 294,604 EP A 74718 , filed August 20, 1981. A number of papers have been published concerning the effect of bacteria on ice nucleation. See, for example, Lindow et al., Proc. Am. Phytopathol. Soc. 1977 4.1976 169 Arny et al., Nature 1976 262 282 283 Lindow et al. Phytophathology 1978 68 523 528 Lindow et al., Appl. Environ.

Pühler , Springer Verlag, 1983, describe the cloning of genes involved in bacterial ice nucleation. They describe how the cloned gene can confer ice nucleation activity on normally INA Notice of an application for permission to construct and release Methods and compositions are provided for inhibiting ice nucleation on plant hosts, particularly on agricultural crops. Ice nucleation deficient INA FIG. 1 illustrates the 9.0 kb Frost injury to host plants is inhibited by the application of ice nucleation deficient INA INA Once a suitable strain of INA Suitable In constructing the modified microorganisms of the present invention, it will be necessary to first identify and isolate the gene locus responsible for the INA phenotype. Conveniently, a genomic library may be obtained by restriction of the genomic DNA of the microorganism to provide fragments of suitable length. Various vectors, including plasmids, phages, and cosmids, can then be employed for cloning of the fragments. The vectors should provide a means for selection and or screening, typically through antibiotic selection, packaging requirements, inactivation of a gene, and the like. Alternatively, a cDNA gene library may be prepared by first isolating the mRNA fraction from the source microorganisms. After extracting the total RNA, the mRNA is separated. The cDNA gene library can then be prepared using reverse transcriptase in the well known manner. The cDNA fragments are then cloned and screened in the manner just described. Gene fragments carrying all or a portion of the INA gene region may be identified by their ability to confer ice nucleation activity on INA Once the genomic fragments carrying the INA gene have been identified, the gene can be modified in a variety of ways and reintroduced into the parental strain to convert the parental strain to an INA In some cases, it may be desirable to insert a marker, such as resistance to biocides or cytotoxic agents, within the INA gene region or elsewhere within the microorganism genome. Insertion of the marker in the INA gene can be relied on to inactivate the INA gene, or can be done in combination with deletion and or other mutations. The introduction of biocide or cytotoxic resistance can impart a competitive advantage to the resistant INA Alternatively, the INA In particular, a deletion mutation of After digestion of the genomic DNA, the After identifying the plasmids carrying the 1.0 or 1.5 kb deletions by restriction mapping and gel electrophoresis, the deletion may be introduced into the parental strain by homologous recombination. Gutterson et al, PNAS, The modified microorganisms of the present invention may be utilized effectively in diverse formulations, including agronomically acceptable adjuvants and carriers normally employed for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for agricultural applications. The precise formulations, dosage, mode of application and other variables are chosen to enhance the inhibition of ice nucleation activity in any given application. Thus, the previously described modified microorganisms may be formulated as a suspension or dispersion, aqueous or non aqueous medium, as a dust, as a wettable powder, as an emulsifiable concentrate, as a granule, or as any of several known types of formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. The concentration of cells in the formulation should be sufficient to provide for establishment of the cells on the host plant in competition with the naturally present microorganisms. For wet formulations, e.g. foliage sprays, suspensions, aerosols, mists and the like, the concentration will generally be from about 10 The formulations may include various additives. In aqueous formulations, surfactants, nutrients, buffers, penetrating agents biological or chemical pesticides, and the like may be provided. In dry formulations, inert powders, bacterial stabilizing agents, salts, anti caking agents, nutrients, buffers, film forming materials, biological or chemical pesticides, and the like may be provided. The additives will generally range in concentration from about 10 ⁴ to 1 weight percent. Preferably, the formulation of the present invention will be applied early in the growth stage of the plant host to provide for establishment of the ice nucleation deficient strains prior to substantial colonization by ice nucleation capable microorganisms. In the case of perennials, such as citrus crops, the formulation will be applied early in each growing season. For example, seeds, tuber parts, plantlets, propagants, or the like may be treated in conventional ways with a dispersion of the microorganisms of this invention in an appropriate medium, e.g., water, nutrient medium, etc. Alternatively, the host plant can be sprayed with a biocide in order to kill the ice nucleation capable microorganisms which are present prior to treatment. This will be particularly effective when the modified microorganisms have been provided with biocide resistance, as described above. In either case, the INA Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced.
