# METHOD AND MEANS FOR STIMULATING COMBUSTION ESPECIALLY OF LEAN MIXTURES IN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
Method and means are disclosed for stimulating com bustion especially of lean mixtures in internal combustion engines. For example, an ultraviolet lamp 28 mounted in the combustion chamber 17 of an engine 12 directs radiation of wavelength exceeding 190 nm on the advancing flame front. The radiation largely passes through the cool unburned mixture and is absorbed in disassociating oxygen molecules in the flame front thereby stimulating combustion of the flame and allowing the burning of exceptionally lean air fuel mixtures. Numerous features and alternative embodiments are disclosed.
