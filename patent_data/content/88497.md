# Glass bubbles of increased collapse strength.

## Abstract
Glass bubbles of increased collapse strength are pre pared. The bubbles have an average particle density of 0.4 or more and are made of glass that consists essentially of SiO₂ 60 90 weight percent , alkali metal oxide 2 20 weight percent , B₂O₃ 1 30 weight percent , sulfur 0.005 to 0.5 weight percent , and other conventional glass form ing ingredients.
