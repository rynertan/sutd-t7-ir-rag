# Audio signal recognition computer.

## Abstract
A signal encoder and classifier particularly adapted to speech recognition includes a circularly addressed buffer 26, 104 which is independently addressed by a new data writing address system 112, 102, 114, 118, 128, 130, 132, 134, 142 and a buffered data reading system 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166 so that writing and reading of data may be accomplished on a time shared basis. This time shared opera tion permits serial writing and reading of the pattern data 112 without interrupting income signal storage. The writing data address system addresses the data into the buffer in a circular fashion while the reading data address system utilizes stored addresses 122, 124, 136, 138, 140 identifying the beginning and end of the signal patterns for addressing sequential pat terns from the buffer.
