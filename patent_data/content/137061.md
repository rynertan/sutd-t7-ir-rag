# Thoracentesis device.

## Abstract
A thoracentesis device which includes an elongated flexible catheter 23 fixed at its proximate end to an elongated conduit 31 which is aligned therewith. The conduit is provided with a seal 37 which seals around a hollow needle 45 which penetrates the seal means and passes through the conduit and the catheter and slightly beyond the catheter distal end 25 . A vacuum source 49 is connected to the proximate needle end. The seal also reseals the elongated conduit when the needle is removed. The conduit includes a valve 53 which can be manipulated to connect the catheter to a side conduit 83 when the needle is removed.
