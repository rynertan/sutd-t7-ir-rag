# Flat type plastic connector means for splicing a plurality of optical fibres.

## Abstract
A connector means includes a connector housing pro vided with a plurality of bores which is defined by a pair of plastic bases 1 each having a plurality of hemicycle grooves 2 each of which has an inner diameter 1 to several Âµm larger than an outer diameter of each of optical cables 3 to be connected. After the optical fibres are inserted into the respective bores and secured therein, one end surface of the connector housing is polished. A pair of connected housings 12, 13 are retained so that the polished end surfaces abut on each other thereby to attain a connection between a plurality of optical cables.
