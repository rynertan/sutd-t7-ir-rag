# Pocket terminal, method and system for secured banking transactions.

## Abstract
An improved portable banking terminal 9 operated off line to randomize the encoding of instructions for secured transmission over unsecured communication channels 56 to an associated institution 31 which can decrypt the instruction without interacting with the terminal to acquire the randomizing data. Information stored in secured manner in the terminal 9 and at the institution 31 can be used to generate new encoding schemes for each transaction so that encoding patterns cannot be deciphered from unauthorized interception of successive sets of instructions.

## Description
Pocket terminal, method and system for secured banking transactions Background of the Invention Funds are commonly transferred electronically between banking institutions using encrypted messages transmitted over secured communication channels. Numerous encoding schemes and interactive message procedures are known which can be used to substantially assure faithful transmission of unaltered funds transfer messages between institutions.However, these funds transfer schemes typically are inadequately secure to protect against unauthorized transfer instructions over voice grade telephone lines, and are typically not suitable for use by a great many individuals having their own computer based terminals. One known technique establishes a portable banking terminal, as described in the literature see, for example, U. S.Patent Application Serial No. 514,011 , and such technique then permits transfers and withdrawals between a banking institution and the portable terminal. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, an improved security encoded funds transferring system, method and apparatus are provided which enable a user to transmit in secured manner selected funds transfer instructions to a banking institution using unsecured communication channels such as telephone, mail, telegram and the like. Encrypted messages may be sent to the banking institution based upon internal key codes, personal identification numbers, and other unique inputs, and the banking institution may acknowledge the faithful reception of the unaltered, authorized instructions by returning an encrypted message that indicates favorable reception of, and action upon, the encrypted message originally transmitted. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of the portable terminal and bank terminal according to the present invention and Figure 2 is a flow chart illustrating the operation of the present invention. Description of the Preferred Embodiment Referring now to the pictorial block diagram ofFigure 1, there is shown a portable terminal 9 which includes a microprocessor 24 centrally connected to operate with a keyboard 19, a display unit 18, a DataEncryption Standard encoder decoder 26, and memory means 27 and 29. The terminal 9 may include optional connector 20 for attachment to voice grade telephone communication channels 56 via a conventional, modular four wire telephone connector. Alternatively, an unsecured communication channel 56 may simply transmit transaction information to a banking institution as mail or telephone data for manual entry. Additionally, the terminal 9 includes a random number generator 10 which, of course, may be performed in conventional manner by the microprocessor controlled 24 selection of feedback paths around successive logic cells of a shift register 29, as described in the literature. It is convenient to consider three phases of operation of the terminal 9. First, at the time of manufacture, each terminal 9 is provided with a uniqueTerminal Identification Code TIC , herein established in known manner for example, using ElectronicallyProgrammable Read Only Memory, EPROM , herein and stored in memory means 27. This terminal identification number or code can be accessed in the operating routine of the terminal 9 without direct control or intervention by a user. Second, the banking institution which furnishes the portable banking terminal 9 has a Security InitializationUnit 31 I SIU , herein that couples to a terminal 9 via connectors 20, as shown in Figure 1, for permanently and irretrievably injecting an encrypted message a ey Exchange Key, KEK , herein into the memory means 27 of the terminal 9. This may be accomplished under control of the microprocessor 33 which operates in master controller relationship to microprocessor 24 of terminal 9 to introduce the KEK into the EPROM type memory means 27. At the same time, the banking institution compiles a listing in memory 41 of all terminals 9, their terminal identification codes, the Personal Identification Number PIN , herein for the assigned user, and the associatedKEK for on line operation, as later described. The listing by the bank may, of course, be encrypted in known manner using a secured bank key for enhanced security against unauthorized operations of the system by bank personnel. Third, a terminal 9 thus initialized with a TerminalIdentification Code and a Key Exchange Key may now be operated off line by the assigned user, as illustrated in the flow diagram of Figure 2. The user A of the terminal 9 which was assigned to him in the initialization process now enters his PIN and his account number 1 via keyboard 19, and activates the terminal 9 to encrypt these numbers in the DES module 26 under control of microprocessor 24 using an irreversible algcrithm 30 of the type described in the literature see, for example,U. S. Patent 3,938,091 to produce a Personal VerificationNumber 42. The PVN is now encrypted in the DES module 26 with the KEK which was previously injected into the memory means of the terminal 9 and a random number 48 that is generated 10 by the terminal 9 in the manner previously described. The resulting encrypted code word 44 is the Working Key1. In addition, the PVN and the KEK are again encrypted in the DES module 26 without the random number 48 to produce an encrypted code word 46 asWorking Rey2. Now the user A may identify the number of the account 2 to which he desires to have funds transferred in one embodiment, the terminal 9 may be regarded as having an account number separate from the account at the banking institution . In addition, User A enters the number of dollars to be transferred from account 11 to account µ2 and other sequential data such as date and time of the transaction as a basis for securing against the same transaction being duplicated at a later time . This data is encrypted in DES module 26 with WK1 to yield a MessageAuthentication Code MAC , herein 52 which may include, say, the most significant 32 bits of a 64 bit output code.This MAC 52 is therefore unique for User A and his PIN, the TIC of terminal 9, the account numberl of User A, the account number2 to which transfer is to be made , the dollars to be transferred, the random number generated by the terminal 9, and the date and time of the transaction. The terminal 9 now encrypts the MAC plus the random number 48 as previously generated with the WK2 in the DES module 26 to produce an output code 54 which may comprise a 64 bit number. Note that the banking institution was not required to be in contact with terminal 9 to produce the output code 54 for this transaction. The transaction may now be communicated 56 to the banking institution by optional means such as telephone, mail, telegram, etc., without security constraints imposed upon the communication. User A thus transmits 56 to the banking institution his Terminal Identification Code, the account number, the account number2, the dollars to be transferred between such accounts, the date and time, and the output code 54. This transmission 56 may be accomplished in clear text since unauthorized interception of the transmission will not yield useful information.Alternatively, this transmission to the banking institution may be suitably encoded for transmission with enhanced security. At the banking institution, the TIC is retrieved from the transmitted data and is compared in the bank list 8 for the corresponding KEK for that terminal 9. The account numberl is compared with the bank list 8 for the corresponding PIN of User A which, of course, with the corresponding account numberl may be encrypted by the same irreversible algorithm 30 to yield PVN . The banking institution may now encrypt 40 the KEK and PVN accessed from the bank list 8 for User A in a DES module in accordance with the same encryption scheme 32 previously used in terminal 9 in order to produce the corresponding WK Then, the 64 bit output code 54 retrieved from the 2 information communicated to the banking institution is decrypted 60 using WK2 and a decryption scheme which corresponds to the encryption scheme 51 to produce the corresponding MAC and random number previously generated in terminal 9. Next, the banking institution can encrypt 58 in a DES module the random number, the PVN and the KEK using the same encryption scheme 34 previously used in terminal 9 to produce a corresponding WK1. The banking institution now has all the corresponding entries and can encrypt 61 in a DES module according to the encryption scheme 36 previously used in terminal 9 the resulting WK, the account number1, the account number2, the dollars to be transferred, and the date and time data was retrieved from the communication 56. This encryption 61 produces the corresponding MAC that is unique with respect to a the KEK, the PIN or PvN and the account number listed for User A, and with respect to b the output code, theTIC, the account number, the account number2, the dollars to be transferred, and the date and time information retrieved from the communication 56 was received at the banking institution. If all of these elements of the transaction are received unaltered, then the MAC from encryption scheme 61 and the MAC from decryption scheme 60 should compare favorably 65. If any element of the transaction is altered, either because of erroneous transmission and reception or because of unauthorized alterations, or the like, then the two MAC signals will differ and the transaction will be aborted by the banking institution. Upon favorable comparison 65, the banking institution may then perform diverse data checks 67 for such details as balance in account number, date and time of transaction used before, frequency of transactions, transaction limits, and the like before completing the requested transaction. If a confirmation of the completed transaction is desired, a return message or indication may be provided in a number of different ways. For example, a portion of the MAC, say, the 20 least significant bits thereof may be segregated and transmitted 70 back to User A by any suitable, unsecured communication means.Transactions which are to be aborted for unfavorable comparison of MAC s, or for unacceptable data checks, or the like, may simply serve to shift the segregated bits of the MAC that are returned to User A. The User A may enter the received message into his terminal 9 where it will be compared 72 with the fixed corresponding portion of theMAC 52 originally generated. Favorable comparison at terminal 9 would therefore constitute indication that all message elements were acceptable, were properly transmitted, received and were acted upon by the banking institution. Unfavorable comparison 72 due, for example, to comparison of one portion of the MAC of terminal 9 with a shifted other portion of the MAC from the banking institution would provide indication that some element of the proposed transaction was unacceptable, or improperly transmitted or received and therefore not acted upon by the banking institution. It should be understood that, as used herein, banking institution includes any depositary of units or elements such as parts in inventory, dollars on deposit, and the like. Also, it should be understood that other transaction codes such as limit the account, stop payment order, or the like, may be used in place of specifying transfer to another account number or name . Also, it should be understood that temporary registers in memory means may be used in conventional manner to store the resulting codes developed by successive encryption procedures in order to facilitate serial operation of oneDES module 26 on successive sets of input codes and keys. Therefore, the present invention facilitates the offline operation of a portable terminal to provide random y coded, secured instructions over unsecured communication channels to an associated institution. The institution can perform security checks on the basis of stored information without the need for interaction with the terminal, and can respond to the instructions without directly requesting the randomizing data. Additional features of the present invention provide secured return messages which can be transmitted over unsecured communication channels to the terminal for entry and detection therein as confirmation of transmission, reception and implementation of the secured instructions.
