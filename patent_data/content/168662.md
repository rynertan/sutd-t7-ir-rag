## Description
RECOMBINANT DNA INSERTED WITH HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS GENE. , MAMMALIAN CELLS TRANSFORMED WITH SAID RECOMBINANT DNA, AND METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PROTEINS The present invention relates to a novel recombinant DNA inserted with herpes simplex virus gene, mammalian cells transformed with said recombinant DNA, and a method for the production of herpes simplex virus proteins, wherein a genetic engineering technique is applied to the production of the desired herpes simplex virus proteins having a high purity which are useful for the production of herpes simplex vaccine effective for the prophylaxis of herpes simplex virus infections. More particularly, the present invention provides a novel recombinant DNA which is obtained by inserting a gene of herpes simplex virus hereinafter, referred to as HSVfl 1 specifically HSVgB genefinto an Escherichia coli plasmid derivative, i.e. a plasmid vector produced by inserting a gene of thymidine kinase hereinafter, referred to as TK into an E. coli plasmid, novel transformed mammalian cells which are produced by transforming mammalian cells, specifically TK deficient mammalian cells e.g. mouseLTK cells with said recombinant DNA, and a method for the production of HSV proteins, particularly HSV membrane proteins in a high yield and high purity by culturing said transformed mammalian cells. Technical Background and Prior Art In developed countries, population having immunity against HSV has recently decreased, and hence, serious problems increase in HSV infections such as herpes genitalis, neonatal herpes infection and herpes encephalitis in these countries. In order to prevent such HSV infections, vaccine is useful, and there have already been proposed some vaccines such as a vaccine comprising attenuated HSV and inactivated vaccine containing HSV DNA.It is known, however, that HSV includes some problems such as latent infection and carcinogenicity, and the conventional attenuated vaccine and inactivated vaccine include such side effects and hence are not preferable in practical viewpoint. Cells infected by HSV produce several glycoproteins te.g. gB, gC, gD, gE, etc., the nomenclature of gA and gB has been standardized as gBt in International HerpesVirus Workshop Oxford, England in 19833. Since it has been found that these glycoproteins show important function as an antigen for inhibiting HSV infection, various studies have been done on component vaccines comprising these glycoproteins. For instance, Cappel et al. have reported that glycoproteins extracted from HSV infected cells or virus particles are effective as an antigen for preventing infection of HSV cf. Cappel et al., Arch. Virol., 73, 61 1982 .However, the component vaccine comprising such glycoproteins extracted from HSV ifected cells or virus particles contains a multitude of proteins derived from the host cells and hence has prcblern of side effect due to these extra proteins. In order to obtain suitable component vaccine having no side effect, it s necessary to obtain highly purified glycoproteins.The present inventors aimed at gB which is one of the glycoproteins and have experimen t ally confirmed that the highly purified gB is very effective in mice cf. Kino, Cellular Technologys 3, 120 3984 The glycoprotein .gB is usually produced by inoculating a virus into culture cells and then culturing the cells. However, this method is troublesome in the procedure because of handling infectious material and in the complicated steps, and further, it is Impossible to confirm the complete removal of viral DNA carrying carcinogenic sequences. Thus, it is very difrtarcuAlt to produce a gractically safe component vaccine from natural glycoprotein gB Brief Summary of the Invention The present inventors have intenvively stud iedon safe vaqcine containing no carcinogenic gene by isolating the gB gene and expressing said gene in mammalian c ellstand have now accomplished in the isolations of ,gB gene and the expression of said gene. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel recomlbinant DNA inserted with HSV gene which is suitable for transforming mammalian cells. Another object of the invention is to provide mammalian cells transformed by said recombinant DNA e.g. transformed mouse L cells . A further object of the invention is to provide a method for the production of HSV proteins by using said transformed mammalian cells. These objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. Brief Description of the drawing Fig. 1 shows a map of BamHI G fragment of HSV DNA and cleave sites thereof with various restriction enzymes. Fig. 2 shows a structure of a recombinant DNA ofE. coli plasmid pBR 322 and a TK gene from HSV DNA. Fig. 3 shows one embodiment of the recombinant DNA of the present invention which is produced by inserting GK fragment containing HSVgB gene into a vector consisting of E. coli plasmid pBR 322 containing a TK gene. Detailed Description of the Invention The desired recombinant DNA of the present invention can be produced by using as a vector derivatives of E. coli plasmid, e.g. a DNA obtained by inserting TK gene into E. coli plasmid and then recombining an HSV gene i.e.HSVgB gene into said vector. The recombinant DNA thus produced is used for transformation of mammalian cells, preferably TK deficient mammalian cells e.g. mouse LTK cells . When the transformed mammalian cells are cultured they under suitable culture conditions give the desired HSV proteins i.e. HSVgB . The recombinant DNA, transformed mammalian cells and the production of HSV proteins of the present invention are illustrated in more detail below. 1 HSVgB gene The HSVgB gene used in the present invention isHSVgB DNA which is cloned in E. coli. The HSV DNA is a DNA having a molecular weight of about 160 K dalton and HSVgB gene is present in a fragment having about 8 kb 0.345 0.399 map units which is obtained by treating HSV DNA with a restriction enzyme BamHI, said fragment being hereinafter referred to as BamHIG fragment. This BamHI G fragment has several cleavage sites with various restriction enzymes e.g. Sal I, Sst I,Kpn I, Bst EII, Xho I, Pst I as is shown in the accompanying Fig. 1. Thus, the HSVgB gene used in the present invention includes BamHI G fragment and further various fragments obtained by cleaving the BamHI G fragment with various restriction enzymes, preferably a fragment having about 4.5 Kb 0.348 0.381 map units which is obtained by treating BamHI G fragment with Kpn I hereinafter, referred to as GK fragment . These fragments can be prepared by cleaving HSVDNA with BamHI, separating thus cleaved BamHI G fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis, amplifying said fragment by cloning in E. coli, preferably followed by treating with a restriction enzyme, e.g. Kpn I. The fragments thus obtained are used for the subsequent construction of the recombinant DNA as they stand. 2 Derivatives of E. coli plasmid The E. coli plasmid derivatives are used as a vector and are recombinant DNAs which are produced by inserting a TK gene from HSV DNA into an E. coli plasmid, for instance, a recombinant DNA obtained from E. coli plasmid pBR322 and HSV DNA which has a structure as shown in the accompanying Fig. 2 cf. Florence Colbere Garapin, 3rdGeneral Meeting of ESACT, Oxford 1979, Develop. Biol.Standard, 46, 75 82 1980 . That is, TK gene 3.5 Kb is inserted into theBamHI site of E. coli plasmid pBR322 to give the desired recombinant DNA which has an ampicillin resistant gene Apr . The antibiotic resistant gene is effective as a selection marker for the transformed cells disclosed hereinafter, and includes tetracycline resistant gene, kanamycin resistant gene, chloramphenicol resistant gene, etc. These vectors are combined with an HSV gene to give the desired recombinant DNA, wherein the vectors are used in the form of a fragment which is obtained by cleaving the vector with a suitable restriction enzyme, e.g. Kpn I. 3 Construction of recombinant DNA HSV geneexpression plasmid The above vector i.e. the E. coli plasmid derivative containing TK gene is treated with a suitable restriction enzyme which does not inactivate the TK gene e.g. Kpn I to give a fragment. The fragment thus obtained is reacted with a fragment containing the above HSVgB gene in an appropriate ratio to give the desired recombinantDNA. Depending on the ratio of the fragment to the vector, there are constructed various recombinant DNAs wherein 1 or with several fragments of HSVgB DNA are combined 1 fragment of the vector. Preferred recombinant DNA is inserted with 1 or 2 fragments of the HSVgB DNA per 1 fragment of the vector. The recombinant DNA thus obtained has a structure as shown in the accompanying Fig. 3. The recombinant DNA shown in Fig. 3 has one Kpn I fragment of HSVgB DNA i.e. GK fragment at the Kpn I site of the vector DNA. 4 Transformation of mammalian cells Mammalian cells are transformed with said recombinant DNA which carries the genetic information for HSVQB. The mammalian cells include preferably TK mammalian cells, particularly mouse LTK cells. The procedure of transformation is explained in more detail in case of using mouse LTK cells. Mouse LTK cells are cultured in a Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium hereinafter, referred to as DMEM supplemented with 10 calf serum cf. Dulbecco, B. BR Freeman, G. Virology, 8, 396, 1956 and thereto is added a solution of the recombinant DNA in an aqueous calcium phosphate solution, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for a few or several tens of minutes, usually about 30 minutes. To the resulting mixture is added additional DMEM, and the mixture is cultured for 4 to 5 hours. After substituting by new DMEM, the mixture is further cultured for 12 to 24 hours.The resulting culture is further cultured in a medium containing hypoxanthine 15 ii g ml , aminopterin 1 pg ml and thymidine 5 pg ml hereinafter, referred to as HAT medium cf. Littlefield J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 3961 3965, 1963 to give the desired transformed mouse L cells. In the above transformation procedure, the starting mouse LTK cells are deficient in TK gene and hence can not grow in HAT medium, but on the other hand, the transformed mouse L cells inserted with TK gene are capable of synthesis of thymidine kinase and hence can grow in HAT medium. Accordingly, only the desired transfonwd cells can selectively be isolated by culturing in the above HAT medium. 5 Culture of transformed mammalian cells and production of HSVgB The transformed mammalian cells obtained above are cultured in an appropriate medium in a usual manner to produce a large amount of HSVgB within the grown cells. The isolation of the HSVgB thus produced can be done by separating the grown mammalian cells, treating the cells with a surfactant e.g. Triton X 100, Nonidet P 40, etc. or an organic solvent e.g. carbon tetrachloride, diethyl ether, etc. to fracture the cell membrane, followed by purifying the gB by a conventional method for purifying proteins. For instance, the gB containing extract is passed through a column packed with a gel bound with anti gB antibody and then eluting the gB with 3M KSCN. The gB thus obtained has the same immunological properties as those of the natural gB obtained from HSVinfected cells and can be used for the preparation of HSV vaccine and diagnostic reagents. The recombinant DNA, transformed mammalian cells, and the production of HSVgB of the present invention are illustrated by the following example, but should not be construed to be limited thereto. Example 1 Preparation of HSV 1 DNA Vero cells about 5 x 108 cells are infected with 0.5 1 PFU cell of HSV type 1 HSV 1 KOS strain and the cells are cultured at 370C for 20 24 hours. When the cells are sufficiently modified, the culture mixture is centrifuged at 30,000 r.p.m. for 1 hour to separate the infected cells and the supernatant, and thereby pellets of infected cells 2 3 ml are isolated. The pellets are suspended in a phosphate buffered saline solution hereinafter, referred to as PBS pH 7.2, 6 ml .The suspension is subjected to ultrasonic treatment 9 KHz, 200 W, for 5 minutes or to freezing thawing repeating three times freezing at 500C with acetone dry ice and thawing at 370C to fracture the cells, and the cell residue is removed by centrifugation at low speed 3,000 r.p.m., 20 minutes . The solution thus obtained is layered on a glycerol cushion 5 , 40 and then centrifuged at 35,000 r.p.m. for one hour.The pellets 0.5 1 ml thus obtained are suspended in PBS 1 2 ml and are treated with DNase 10 vg ml and RNase 0.3 mg ml at 370C for one hour, and to the reaction mixture is added 1 5 volume of 5 x STEP a mixture of 0.5 SDS sodium dodecylsulfate , 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.4 M EDTA, and 0.1 proteinase K , and the mixture is reacted at 500C for 30 minutes. The resulting solution is extracted with an equivolume of phenol, phenol chloroform 1 1 and chloroform in this order to give an aqueous layer containing DNA. The aqueous layer is dialyzed against TE buffer 20 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 , and thereto is added cold ethanol to precipitate the DNA. The DNA is separated by filtration, dried in vacuum, and then dissolved in aqueous cesium chloride Rf 1.3885, incorporated with ethidium bromide 0.04 and lauroyl sarcosinate 0.4 , 5 ml . The mixture is centrifuged at 4,000 r.p.m. for 72 hours to form a band of HSV 1 DNA. The band is recovered and is washed with isopropyl alcohol to remove ethidium bromide, and then dialyzed against TE buffer. Cold ethanol is added thereto to precipitate HSV 1 DNA. 2 Cloning of BamHI G fragment of HSV 1 DNA The HSV 1 DNA obtained above about 100 pg is treated with a restriction enzyme BamHI in a mixture 0.75 ml of 73 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 7 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM 2 mercaptoethanol at 370C for 6 hours, and then each fragment is separated by 0.7 agarose electrophoresis to cut out a gel corresponding to G fragment 0.345 0.399 map units , from which the G fragment is electrophoretically recovered. pBR322 plasmid 1 10 mole obtained by cleavage with a restriction enzyme BamHI is reacted with the above G fragment about 2 vg in a mixture of 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9 , 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM ATP by using T4 DNA ligase at 160C for about 16 hours. The above reaction mixture is added to a liquid ofE. coli 0.1 ml which is prepared by treating a culture broth of E. coli x1776 cf. Curtiss, R. III, MolecularCloning of Recombinant DNA ed. Scott, W. A. and Werner, R., page 99, Academic Press, 1977 by the procedure as described in Norgard, M. V., Gene, 3, 279 1978 , and the mixture is mixed well and allowed to stand at OOC for 45 minutes. The mixture is applied onto an agar plate containing ampicillin 100 vg ml and th en incubated at 370C overnight.The resulting colonies are applied onto both an agar plate containing ampicillin 100 gg ml and an agar plate containing tetracycline 100 ssg ml , and the colonies which grow only on the agar plate containing ampicillin are selected. pBR322 has an ampicillin resistant gene and a tetracycline resistant gene, but when it is inserted withHSV 1 DNA fragment at the BamHI site of the tetracyclineresistant gene, it loses the tetracycline resistance.Accordingly, the selected colonies contain the recombinantDNA pBR322 HSV which caries the BamHI G fragment as an insertion. From the colonies thus selected, a plasmid is prepared by the procedure as described by K. Matsubara J.Virol., 16, 479, 1975 . The plasmid thus prepared is subjected to cleavage pattern analysis by treating with various restriction enzymes e.g. BamHI, Bst EII, Kpn I, SalI, Sst I, Xho I to obtain a recombinant DNA of pBR322 BamHIG fragment wherein BamHI G fragment of HSV 1 DNA is inserted into pBR322 hereinafter, referred to as pBR322 G . 3 Preparation of recombinant DNA pBR322 TK gene GK fragment The pBR322 G obtained above is cleaved by treating the it with restriction enzyme Kpn I in a mixture of 6 mMTris HCl pH 7.5 , 6 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2 and 6 mM 2mercaptoethanol, and from the resulting DNA fragments, there is obtained GK fragment 0.348 0.381 map units in the same manner as in the preparation of G fragment as mentioned above. The above GK fragment is bound at the Kpn I cleavage site with a previously cloned pBR322 TK DNA i.e.a recombinant DNA prepared by binding BamHI cleavage site of pBR322 with Q fragment obtained by cleaving HSV DNA containing TK gene with BamHI cf. Construction andCharacterization of A Recombinant Plasmid Encoding The Gene for the Thymidine Kinase of Herpes Simplex type 1 virus, Enquist et al., Gene, 7, 335 342, 1979 to give a recombinantDNA of pBR322 TK gene GK fragment. The preparation of the recombinant DNA is carried out by subjecting the ampicillin resistant colonies prepared in the same manner as in the preparation of the above pBR322 G to colony hybridization using 32P labeled GK fragment as a probe and then selecting the desired colony cf. Protein.Nucleic acid Enzyme, 26, No. 4, Genetic Engineering Procedure, 575 579 1983 .The plasmid thus prepared is cleaved by various restriction enzymes e.g. BamHI, Xho I, Sst I, Kpn I in order to determine the restriction map, by which the insertion and direction of GK fragment are characterized. 4 Transformation of mouse LTK cells The recombinant DNA of pBR322 TK gene GK fragment obtained above is cleaved by a restriction enzymeBamHI. The fragment thus obtained pBR322 TK GK fragment 2 pg and LTK DNA carrier DNA 2 gg are dissolved in 130 mM CaCl2 200 pl and thereto is added 2 xHepes solution which consists of NaCl 16 g l, KCl 0.74 g l, NaHP0492H2O 0.25 g l, dextrose 2 g l, N 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid 10 g l, pH 7.11 200 l , and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resulting precipitates are well suspended, and then, the mixture is added dropwise to an about 60 single layer of mouse LTK cells about 105 cells flask in a flask.The flask is kept at 370C for one hour in order to make the mixture absorbed into the cells, and thereto is added DMBI 5 ml , and the mixture is incubated under 5 CO2 at 370C for 4 hours. After removingDMEM by suction, a Hepes solution containing 15 dimethylsulfoxide is added to the mixture, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 minutes. The mixture is washed with DfIEM twice, and then newDMEM 5 ml is added, and the mixture is incubated under 5 CO2 at 370C for 24 hours. The medium is exchanged to HAT medium, and the incubation is continued while the medium is exchanged with a new HAT medium every two to three days. After about two weeks, the colonies of HAT resistant cells LTK cells are collected to give the desired transformed cells. 5 Production of HSV 1 HSVgB The transformed mouse L cells LTK cells obtained above are defatted by treating with carbon tetra chloride for 10 minutes and are reacted with a monoclonal antibody against HSV 1 surface glycoprotein gB as a primary antibody . After washing and drying, the cells are further reacted with a fluorescent pigment labelled anti mouse IgG as a secondary antibody , and then washed, dried and encapsulated. According to observation by a fluorescence microscope, a specific antibody against gB was observed within cytoplasm of the transformed cells. Besides, a solution of the transformed cells in 1 Triton X 100 was added to a plate having 96 wells wherein a monoclonal antibody against gB was immobilized, and they were reacted at 370C for one hour. After washing, a monoclonal antibody against gB which was bound with peroxidase was added, and the mixture was reacted at 370C for one hour. After washing, ortho phenylenediamine a substrate for peroxidase was added to the reaction mixture, by which coloring was observed and thereby the presence of gB was confirmed. Moreover, a solution of the transformed cells in 1 Triton X 100 was subjected to SDS electrophoresis and then blotted on nitrocellulose. Thereafter, the cells were reacted with a monoclonal antibody against gB. After washing, the cells were further reacted with an anti mouseIgG antibody bound with peroxidase. After washing, diaminobenzidine a substrate was added to the reaction mixture, by which there was observed a gB like pattern in the solution of HSV 1 infected LTK cells in 1 Triton X100. The transformed cells containing produced gB were intraperitoneally administered to mice BALB c . After several weeks, blood serum of the mice was observed. As a result, there was observed a significant increase of neutralizing antibodies against HSV 1.
