# Method for checking disk identity in a flexible disk recorder.

## Abstract
A diskette identifying code is written in each sector on a flexible recording disk 10 used in a flexible disk recorder, The diskette identifying code can be read from any track 12, 14, 16 on the flexible disk 10 and used to log the occurrence of insertion or removal of the diskette at the flexible disk recorder. Also, the diskette identifying code can be read from any accessed track prior to a write operation on that track in order to verify that the diskette has not been changed by the operator since the last access to the flexible disk.
