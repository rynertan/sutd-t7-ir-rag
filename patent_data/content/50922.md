## Description
Picture Imaqe Observation Systems The present invention concerns a picture image observation system comprising a plural number of optical fibers bundled in alignment which is capable of focusing a picture image of an object to be observed at one end of said plural optical fiber bundle for observation of the picture image transmitted through said optical fiber bundle at the other end thereof. Picture image observing systems are generally of the type wherein a plural number of optical fibers each of which constitutes a picture element are bundled in alignment so that a picture image of an object to be observed is formed by means of an image forming lens at one end of the optical fiber bundle, transmitted therethrough and enlarged by means of an eyepiece or the like at the other end thereof for inspection.Since the devicebin such systems are extremely small in diameter and flexible in materials, they have been applied to a wide scope of the fields from industrial applications in various pipes such as heat conductive piDes used in beat exchangers at a chemical plant or a nuclear plant or a steel mill and medical applications to examine inside of a body such as cardiocameras or gastrocameras to civil usages as security cameras or devices for monitoring dead angles in automobiles. The scope of this application is not limited to such uses but will extend further. One application in future will be in an atmosphere filled with particles or volatile qaes. since unlike conventional TV monitoring systems the present, system is completely free of the possibility to trigger electric sparks and thus should not cause explosion nor endanger workers. However, depending on the place to be used, the very advantage of this type of the system or the high flexibility of the system might present a disadvantage. Typically when used in the length of a pipe or a duct to observe an internal wall surface etc., the system due to the high flexibility thereof is difficult to insert straight into the pipe. Further, when the picture image observing system is to pass through particles, steam or harmful gases, the image forming lens should be protected from such so as to minimize degradation of the picture image.When the system is used to detect or to selectively probe one narrow area in detail out of a larger area of, for instance, an affected area in a human body, the magnifying ratio has to be adjusted however, the prior art systems can only adjust the ratio by varying the distance between the image forming lens and the object, presenting heretofore formidable inconvenience. Further in prior art, when used to observe such places as inside of a pipe or a human body where exterior light can not reach, a light guide comprising a bundle of plural optical fibers is provided along the picture image observing system to guide illumination light from a light source at one end to the other end.In such arrangement in order to obtain a brighter image, it is necessary either to intensify the light from the light source or to reduce the diffusion of the light beam emitted from, the other end. In a case to use a spot illumination light, the light has to be moved to scan a range of observation consecutively in order to observe the whole area. Further when used to observe an inner surface of a pipe, a picture image observation system should be provided with one end thereof twisted to face a side direction and, therefore, in order to observe the whole inner circumferential surface of the pipe the system should be turned around in a spiral fashion, presenting a formidable difficulties heretofor. Such system should be made more useful if it can be freely directed to observe either frontal or side directions in the pipe.As described hereinabove, the prior art picture image observing system is defective in that only an image forming lens is located at one end thereof, limiting its application considerably. The present invention aims at eliminating the aforementioned inconvenience and defects of the prior art by providing auxiliary devices at one end of the system which is operable by a means of remote controlling mechanism using wire cables, fluid pressure or electricity and more specifically by providing such devices as a side view device, an observation direction switching device, a travelling device, a lens protection device and or zoom lens in order to facilitate the operation of the picture image observation system as well as to expand the scope of application thereof. The system according to the present invention is advantageous in that it can observe the whole inner circumference of a pipe without twisting the system thanks to an observation direction switching device provided thereon to direct the lens either front or side directions whenever necessary. A travelling device provided on the system enables the system to pass through a bent pipe smoothly while a lens protection device protects the picture image observation system from harmful effects on the image forming lens thereof even if the system has to go through the atmosphere filled with particles or harmful gases. An illumination light scanning device conveniently provided according to the present invention enables the system to offer brighter images by scanning the observation range with a spot light.A zoom lens provided on the system is capable of observing arbitrary ranges without the necessity to move the picture image observation system itself. The following is a description of some specific embodiments of the invention reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a cross section view to show the basic structure of an embodiment of the picture image observation system according to the present invention when provided with a side view device as an auxiliary device.

Fig. 13 is a cross sectional view to show the basic structure of an embodiment of the picture image observation system according to the present invention when provided with a zooming device as an auxiliary device and Fig.14 is a schematic view to explain the basic structure of an embodiment of a remote control means using hydraulic pressure. Referring to the embodiment of the present invention provided with a side view device shown in Figs. 1 through 4, an outer case 102 is positioned for protective purpose on the end of incidence of a picture image observation system 101 which is referred to as an image transmission line comprising optical fiber elements in the number from thousands to tens of thousands arranged in s bundle. On the end surface of incidence 103 of the image transmission line 101 is mounted an image pick up adaptor 106 which incorporates an image forming lens 105 to pick up a picture image of an object to be observed such as an inner wall.of a pipe 104.The image pick up adaptor 106 is provided with an annular transparent window 107 at the center of which is located an image pick up prism of total internal reflection right angle prism 108 to direct an image of the object 104 toward an image forming lens 105, the object being positioned around said window 107 in a direction perpendicular to the optic axis of the lens 105. A driving motor 109 is mounted inside a side view casing 110 which is connected to the image pick up adaptor 106 via the window 107 to support the image pick up prism 108 in a freely rotatable fashion. The driving motor 109 is controlled in operation by the remote control means via an electric control cable 11. The outer circumference of said window 107 is notched to form 36 equally divided scales in ,this embodiment so that, as shown in Fig. 44when an image of the object 104 is formed in a range, a portion of such scale is automatically observed along the object in the picture image 113 obtained. It is necessary to set the fo length of the lens 105 deep enqugh to secure clear observation of both the angle scales 111 and the picture image 113 of the object 104. Although an image pick up prism 108 is used in this embodiment, a plane mirror can be used effectively instead if it is inclined by 450 with respect of the optic axis of the image forming lens 105. In this embodiment, a picture image projector system is transmissio provided at the rear end side of the image7,ine 101. More particularly, a cylindrical rear end casing 114 is provided transmission at the rear end of said imageNIine 101. A projection lens 115 is provided on the rearward extension of the image transmission line 1101 within the rear end casing 114. A driving motor lib wnicn is to operate synchronously to said driving motor 109 on the projection side is mounted facing forward in the rear portion of the rear end casing 114.On the rotating shaft thereof 117 is mounted a projection prism of total internal reflection 118 as for the optical system on the projection side. In other words, the image transmission line 101, the projection lens 115 and the projection prism 118 are aligned linearly and the projection prism 118 is adapted to rotate by the driving motor 116. Before the rotation starts, the image pick up prism 108 and the projection prism 118 face to the same direction. They are made to face permanently it the same direction because the driving motors 109 and 116 to rotate the prisms 108 and 118 are synchronized. Instead of said projection prism, a reflective mirror may be utilized.The rear portion of the casing 114 facing the light beam from said image transmission line lOl.reflecte by said projection prism 118 in said rear casing 114 has inserted therein an annular screen 119 made of glass or plastic materials. transmission A picture image transmitted through the image rinse 101 is passed to the projection lens 115, reflected by the projection prism 118 and projected on the annular screen 119. Due to the synchronous operation of the driving motor 109 on the pick up side and the driving motor 116 on the projection side, a picture image of a pick up location is projected on the screen 119 at a location corresponding thereto.In the case of slow rotation of the driving motors 109 and 116, observation is facilitated with a memory screen while in the case of speedy rotation, it is facilitated with an after image effect. transmissionIrrespective of the torsion of the image Tine. 101, it becomes possible to readily obtain the degree of deviation from a reference position by rotating the image pick up prism 108 by means of the driving motor 109, reading the scale mark 112 at a reference position of an object 104, for instance, a joint of pipes, rotating again the image pick up prism 108 to read the scale mark 112 of the observation point and then obtaining the difference between the two scale marks. The present invention will now be explained referring to an embodiment provided with tan observation direction switching device indicated in Figs. 5 and 6. transmission A casing 203 housing an image line 201 and a light guide 202 etc. is sealed in its construction by providing an annular window for side view 204 and that for front view 205 made of such materials as glass or plastics which allow light to transmit therethrough. At the center of the casing 203 and where the side view window 204 locates, an image pick up prism 206 which direct the path of light beam substantially at a right angle is provided. Although an image pick up prism 206 is used in this embodiment, a reflective mirror could be used instead. The image pick up prism 206 is supported on a driving motor 207 in a fashion rotatable by 3600. A switching prism 208 is housed in a manner axially movable toward the front view window 205. The switching prism 208 is fixed on a rack 209 slidably supported on the casing 203 and moved forward or rearward or to the axial direction of the casing 203 by the rotation of the driving motor 211 engaged thereto via said rack 209 and a worm 210. As a driving means, besides the rack 209 and the worm 21 0, a screw pair may be used. This switching prism 208 recedes for side view observation so that the internal surface of a pipe can be observed by use of the image pick up prism 216 while for front view observation it moves ahead to oppose said side view prism 206 SQ that the path of light is directed toward a frontal direction. Between the switching prism 208 and the front view window 205 is interposed a transparent case 213 of a form of a disk supporting a magnetic needle 212 in a freely swinging fashion via a pivot bearing. The surface of the case 213 is notched to form direction scale marks.In the case 213, a magnetic needle 212 is positioned in parallel to the end face of incidence of an image forming lens not shown housed in the pick up adaptor 215 so as to indicate a magnetism corresponding to the geomagnetism. The window for the front view 205 is used in this embodiment as a lens to temporarily form an image of an object on the surface of the case 213, thereby focusing the picture images of the object and the magnetic needle 212 simultaneously and clearly on transmission the end face of incidence of the image line 201 by the image forming lens. Accordingly, when the focal depth of the image forming lens is deep a case 213 may be mounted at the position where the window for front view locates.As indicated above, by using the magnetic needle 211 for the front view observation, it becomes possible to observe an object while simultaneously confirming the direction of the object. Therefore, even if Ltransmission the image line used is of length, the direction of the object can be confirmed without being affected by torsion.Due to the smaller size thereof, it is readily mountable as well as easily made water proof so as to put into application in water. Power is supplied to the driving motors 207 and 211 via the electric control line 216. Therefore, in order to observe the internal wall surface of a pipe, the switching prism 208 should be receded so that the side view prism 206 alone be used to bend the light path only once at a right angle, whereby minute defects on the pipe wall or scales attached thereto can be detected efficiently. When moving this system inside the pipe for a different observation location, the switching prism 208 which has been receded is moved forward to oppose the side view prism 206, thereby bending the light path twice at a right angle. The side view prism 206 does not rotate but stays still at the position opposing the switching prism 208.Facing forward, it then is moved ahead through the observation object such as an inside of a pipe. The angle scale marks 112 indicated in Fig. 3 may be notched on the side view window 204. An embodiment according to the present invention with a travelling device shown in Figs. 7 and 8 will be now explained hereinbelow. The pipe path travelling device is provided with a cylindrical cable holder 302 which is made hollow in order to Lransmission support the image line 301 and an arm 305 to attach three wheels in a radial fashion so that it functions as a mechanism to travel the system while guiding said cable holder 302 within the pipe path 303. The base end of said arm 305 is journaled on the cable holder 302 in a freely rotatable fashion while the tip end thereof is formed in a form of a fork so as to sandwich the wheels 304, thereby enabling the wheels to rotate freely.Springs 308 are interposed between said arms 305 and the cable holder 302 to press the wheels 304 on the arms 305 to outward direction or upon the inner circum ference of the pipe 303. An outer rotor motor not shown is mounted on one of the wheels 304 in a manner to coaxially rotate at outer side of the motor with the wheels 304 so that the system can travel. At the outer circumference of the rotor a wheel having an identical outer diameter with the other wheels is mounted. The outer rotor motor is remotely controlled by an electric control line not shown . The mechanism to drive the wheels 304 is not limited to the outer rotor motor. The wheels may be directly mounted on the shaft of a motor or the motor shaft may be rotated by a motor mounted on an arm via a worm, so far as the mechanism sufficiently functions to drive the wheels. In actual observation of the internal path of a pipe using such observation system as mentioned above, an image transmit line 301 as shown in Fig. 1 or 5 is first attached on a cable Lransrnission holder 302. In this embodiment an image Iine for side view is used. The three wheels 304 are next compressed together with the arm 305 before they are inserted into the pipe path 303.Then, the outer rotor motor is supplied power from a power source to control the movement of the system for the observation of the internal surface of the pipe. Even if the pipe path is bent somewhere in the middle, since the arms 305 which mounts the wheels 304 are provided with springs so as to be able to extend freely in a radial direction, it can readily travel along the bent portion of the path. If the wheels 304 are made of such elastic materials as rubber, the elasticity of the wheels 304 together with the spring force of the spring transmisslon 308 can sufficiently support the weight of the image line 301 which enables the system travel in pipes not only arranged horizontally but also vertically. In short, the detection portion of the observation system can be travelled freely even if there is a bend or other irregularities in the path since the arm supporting the wheels are made extendable to any radial directions. The system can be guided into ndt only a horizontal pipe path but also any pipe paths with an inclination and even to a vertical one. An embodiment according to the present invention provided with a protection device will now be explained referring to Figs. 9 and 10. This protection device for lens transmission is effective for the imageline shown in Fig. 5 which is adapted to observe the front direction. At the tip end of an transmission image Tine 401 is mounted an image pick up adaptor 403 housing an image forming lens 402 to focus an image of an object to be observed on the incident end face. On the front face of the image pick up adaptor 403 is provided a cover 404 extending thereover. The cover 404 is engaged with a switching cap 405 which is controllable through a wire cable 4Q6 by a switching mechanism installed close to an eyepiece on the other side of the image fiber 401. The front face of the image pick up adaptor 403 is completely covered with the cover 404 and the switching cap 405. The switching cap 405 is opened or closed by horizontal sliding of the wire cable 406 which is transmitted to a switching controller 408 constituting a link device. The tip end of the wire cable 406 is fixed on the shaft 409 of the switching controller 408 and, since the other shafts 410 and 411 of the switching controller 408 are fixed on the switching cap 405, the switching cap 405 is made to open in a direction shown by the arrow mark in Fig. 9 with one end fixed on the shaft 412 by sliding the wire cable 406 to the left direction. At the base end of the wire cable 406 which is a means of remote control, on the other hand, as shown in Fig. 10, is provided a switching means 407. In this embodiment the switching means 407 comprises a push rod 413 and a holder supporting the rod 414. On the belly portion 415 of the holder 414 is provided a compressed coil spring 416 which is constantly energized via a recipient 417 on the pushing rod 413 to the direction toward the head 418 of the pushing rod 413. Therefore, when the head 418 of the pushing rod 413 is pushed, the compression coil spring 416 is pressed through the recipient 417, transmitting a force to slide the wire cable 406 to the left. The transmitted force functions to open the switching cap 405. In order to keep the switching cap 405 open while observation, the pushing rod 413 can be held within the bolder 414 by tightening a setscrew 419.If the setscrew 418 is loosened, the pushing rod 413 xs pushed back to the original position by the effect of the compression coil spring 416 to close the switching cap 405. Although in this embodiment the method to control switching of the switching cap 405 through the use of a wire cable 406 is described, the present invention is not limited to this method. Any methods to passively control the opening and closing of the cap 405 such as hydraulic or pneumatic methods may be used and if the environment is not likely to explode, the cap 405 may be controlled for opening and closing even by the motor drive through electric control. The configuration of the cap is, needless to say, not limited to the one indicated for the embodiment.By providing the above protection, the optical means within toe pick up adaptor can be effectively protected from dusts or fog which might be accumulated thereon to deteriorate the quality of an image as well as from damages thereof. This embodiment may be used as transmission an auxiliary device for an image line in combination with the observation direction switching device and or the travelling device shown in Figs. 7 and 8. An embodiment of the present invention provided with an illumination device shown in Figs. 11 and 12 will now be described below. Referring to Fig. 11 which shows an embodiment applied to the front direction observation in Fis. 5 Ltransmission in, parallel to the image line 1501 for transmitting picture images, there is provided a light guide 502 for transmitting illumination light comprising Åa plural number of optical fiber transmission elements. The image, line501 is adapted to conduct a wideangle image picking up.Flanges 503 are provided around the tip end as well as toward rear end of the light guide 502 with equal intervals and around the tipmost flange 503 on the periphery thereof is fixed wire cables 504 at four places.Each wire cable 504 is guided through the guide holes 505 provided on other flanges 503 to the rear end of the light guide 502. In the drawing, the reference numeral 506 denotes Aransmission an outer sheath for the image line 501 and the light guide 502. For the observation in dark places, a portion of an transmission area to be observed by the image line 501 is lit in a spot by the light from the light guide. Since the light beam is focused upon a small portion, the area is efficiently lit for brighter images. In order to observe other portions in the area, the tip end of the light guide is directed by the wire cables 504 to illuminate the desired portion. The number of the wire cables 504 may be two but preferably more than three so as to direct the tip end of the light guide 502 to any arbitrary directions. Fig. 12 indicates an embodiment for side view wherein a light guide 502 is provided in parallel to a side view image transmissio line 501 for transmitting picture images. A window 507 is transmission bored on the side of the image line 501 as an incident means transmission in this embodiment however, any image line without windows such as used in the embbdiments shown in Figs. 1 to 5 may be used. On the front extension of said light guide 502 , there is provided a reflective mbnsr 508 of an optical system which is interlocked with a driving motor 509, a rotation driving mechanism. A prism may be used in place of. the reflective mirror 508 in the optical system. A spot illumination light from the light guide 502 is changed in direction by said reflective mirror 508 to illuminate a transmission portion within the range of image a by the image line 501 .In order to observe other portions within the range a , the position. to emit the illumination beam will be changed by rotating the reflective mirror 508 through driving a motor 509.In the drawing, the reference numeral 506 denotes a sheath transmissior for the image line 501 and the light guide 502 while 510 a casing for the system. According to the embodiment, a portion within the range of image is illuminated by a spot illumination as well as scanned thereby to enhance the efficiency in utilization of the light energy and to obtain brighter image throughout the range. The present embodiment may be used freely in combination with any of aforementioned devices such as the side view observation device, the observation direction switching device, the travelling device and or the lens protection device. An embodiment according to the present invention provided with a zoom device as shown in Fig. 13 will now bye described below. An image pick up adaptor 603 incorporating a zoom lens 602 as an image forming lens is provided on the tip transmission end of the image line 601. The adaptor 603 is engaged in a freely slidable fashion with a cylindrical zooming device 604 containing lenses l2, l3 and l5 to vary the magnification of 5 picture images. Also on the adaptor 603 is fixed lenses i1 14 and 26. On the zooming device 604 is a projection extending 6 over the outer side of the adaptor 603 to fixedly hold the end of wire cables 606.By sliding the wire cable 606 horizontally, the zooming device 604 is slided horizontally within the adaptor 603 to vary magnification of picture images. For controlling the wire.cable 606, the means indicated in Fig. 10 may be used however, any means to passively control the zooming device such as hydraulic or pneumatic means may be used. For instance, as indicated in Fig. 14, the pick up adaptor 603 is covered with an outer cylinder 607. A piston 608 which is integrally connected to a projection 605 is fitted between said adaptor 603 and said outer cylinder 607 in a freely slidable manner. There is formed a hydraulic pressure chamber 610 between the piston 608 and a partition 609 which the pick up adaptor 603 is connected to. A hydraulic pipe 611 is made to penetrate the hydraulic pressure chamber 610 from the other end of the picture image transmission path 601. A piston 614 having an oil chamber 613 at the center thereof is housed in a cylinder 612 positioned at the other end of the picture image transmission path. 601. A hydraulic pressure chamber 615 is formed between one end of the piston 614 and the cylinder 612 to be connected to said hydraulic pipe 611. On the other end of the piston 614 abuts a tip end of an adjusting screw 616 screwed over the cylinder 612. Said oil chamber 613 is filled with oil supplied from an oil tank 617. In the figure, the reference numeral 618 denotes a compression coil spring which constantly forces the piston 608 against the pressure applied by the oil in the hydraulic pressure chamber 610 and which is interposed between the end face of the outer cylinder 607 and the end face of the piston 608.In operating the zooming device, simply by screwing the adjusting screw 616, the piston 614 is pushed in to apply an increased pressure in the hydraulic pressure chamber 610 and subsequently to push the piston 608, thereby moving the piston and and the zooming device 604 to a position where the pressure in the hydraulic pressure chamber 610 counterbalances the spring force of the coil spring 618. Although oil is used as a fluid means in this embodiment, other means such as air or other gasses may be used. Therefore, by using this device, a narrow area is first déteed for observation and then the object is zooms a up for detailed observation. Since the zooming mechanism is controlled by not only electric control but any simple and passive control methods such as wire, hydraulic, pneumatic methods, the system can be made light in weight and improved in such characteristics as thermal resistance, chemical resistance, radiation resistance and or anti explosion. This embodiment may be used in combination with any one or more of the aforementioned devices such as the side view device, the observation direction switching device, the travelling device, the lens protection device and or the illumination scanning device to function as an auxiliary device.
