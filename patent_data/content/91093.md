# Method and apparatus for cleansing and disinfecting toilet tanks and bowls.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for cleansing and disinfecting a toilet tank and toilet bowl by treating the water discharged from the toilet tank each time the toilet is flushed. A passive dosing dispenser that automatically dispenses a disinfectant with each flush is provided in the tank to carry out the cleansing and disinfecting method. The dispenser 20 comprises a series of chambers in fluid communication including a reservoir 21 containing the source of disinfec tant, a vented volume control chamber 30 , a delivery tube 40 provided with a dispensing orifice 43, 45 in dynamic fluid communication with liquid in the toilet tank, and a vented standpipe 46 . The respective chambers have volumes selected to provide a controlled dispensing action, and the arrangement of chambers is such that the concentra tion of the aqueous disinfectant solution discharged remains substantially constant upon repetitive flushing, and or dur ing extended quiescent periods. The dispenser can be provided with means responsive to toilet tank and toilet water contaminants that tend to interfere with the disinfec tant dispensed.
