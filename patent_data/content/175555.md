# HYDRAULIC TENSIONING DEVICE

## Abstract
A hydraulic tensioning device for tensioning the rigging of a sailing vessel comprises first, second and third components 12, 14, and 16 which are telescopical with respect to one an other. A cylinder 18 of component 12 and a piston 24 of com ponent 14 form a chamber 48, and a cylinder 32 of component 14 and a piston 38 of component 16 form a chamber 50, the chambers 48 and 50 being in fluid flow communication with one another via a passage 52. Eyes 22 of component 12 are connected to one part of the rigging, and eye 36 of component 14 to another part of the rigging. The rigging is tensioned by ap plying tension to a rope or wire connected to eye 46 of compo nent 16. In another embodiment the component 12 is mounted for guided displacement along a rail 58, the components 14 and 16 each being connected by a rope or wire 64 to a cam cleat 66, 68 to limit longitudinal displacement.
