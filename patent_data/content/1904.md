# Method of producing alkylene glycol mono acetates and mono propionates.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for producing alkylene glycol monesters from olefin oxides and carboxylic acid using a chromium carboxylate catalyst, chromium octanoate being most preferred. The esters produced using this catalyst are substantially pure and is obained in high yield. The esters thus produced are ideal for use as ester hardeners for foundry cores.
