# CROSSLINKABLE COMPOSITION COMPRISING AMINOEPOXY RESINS I, II

## Abstract
A crosslinkable composition of matter is provided, which comprises first and second chain extended diepoxide resins, wherein, optionally, one or both of said resins are prepared using an excess of diepoxide reactant and modified by reaction with hydroxy functional secondary amine. The first resin, diene functional aminoepoxy resin, and the second resin, blocked dieneophile functional aminoepoxy resin, are co reactive at elevated cure temperature. The diene function al aminoepoxy resin comprises the reaction product of diepoxide with amine functional diene chain extending reactant and, optionally, monofunctional end capping reac tant such as monohydroxy functional diene. The blocked dieneophile functional aminoepoxy resin comprises the reaction product of diepoxide with amine functional blocked dieneophile chain extending reactant and, optionally, mono functional end capping reactant such as monohydroxy func tional blocked dieneophile. The composition may further comprise crosslinking agent reactive with hydroxy function ality of the resins. The crosslinkable composition of matter is useful in coating and other applications, especially solvent based primer coating compositions and cathodic electro coating compositions.
