# Monolithic integrated circuit device including AC negative feedback type high frequency amplifier circuit.

## Abstract
An AC negative feedback circuit 14 includes a semicon ductor impedance element 41 connected to an external terminal 11d on the substrate on which the whole device is formed, and variable control means 20 for adjusting the amount of AC feedback of the high frequency amplifier circuit. As the semiconductor impedance element is used the junction capacitance of a diode 41 under negative bias, diffusion capacitance between the base and emitter elec trodes or between the base and collector electrodes of a transistor 51 or a differentiated resistance of a diode 62 .
