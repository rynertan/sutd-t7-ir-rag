## Description
METAL WORKING FLUID COMPOSITION Description The present invention relates to water soluble metal working compositions in general, and to water soluble lubricants and coolants in particular. Metalworking compositions of the present invention may be used in commercial applications, such as steel drilling, milling, tapping, grinding, boring, turning and cutting. Several water based metal working fluid compositions are known in the art. U.S. Patent No. 2,917,160 to Turinsky relates to a water soluble lubricating composition of an ethoxylated amine and a salt forming acid, such as phosphoric acid or lactic acid. According to Turinsky, this lubricant composition should have a pH below 8, and is useful in water emulsions in a ratio of 1 part amine to 3 parts water. A similar aqueous cutting fluid is disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 3,186,946 to Sluhan. This cutting fluid consists of a tertiary ethoxylated amine in aqueous solution with boric acid to form an amine salt. Other water based metal working compositions are known in the art. U.S. Patent No. 3,195,332 to Ranauto discloses an aqueous lubricant composition which includes a polyoxyethylene imidazoline. A corrosion inhibitor, such as sodium nitrite, triethanol amine or morpholine may also be included. U.S. Patent No.2,990,369 to Shapiro discloses a metal working lubricant specifically adapted for the cutting and grinding of titanium. This water based lubricant composition comprises sodium fluoride, a high molecular weight imidazoline, a silicofluoride and a rosin amine ethylene oxide adduct. U.S. Patent No. 3,265,620 to Heiman discloses an aqueous metal working coolant comprising an ethanol amine, an alkali metal nitrite, and an aryl triazole which is at least one of benzotriazole and 4 nitrobenzotriazole. Heiman discloses that such compositions preferably should include a chelating agent, such as an amino polycarboxylic acid. Another metal working composition, which may be emulsified in water, is disclosed by U.S. Patent No.4,185,485 to Schick et al. This composition includes an ester formed by reacting an alkenylsuccinic anhydride or acid with a hydroxy containing tertiary alkylamine, such as triethanol amine, or a hydroxy polyether amine. This composition may also contain a C2 C10 monocarboxylic acid. When the reaction product is formed from an alkenylsuccinic anhydride or acid reacted with a hydroxy polyether amine, the composition may contain a rosin soap in addition to or instead of the monocarboxylic acid.

Another phosphorus based metal working composition is disclosed in PolishPatent Document No. 116,962 to Szczepaniak et al. However, these metal working fluids may have some disadvantages which are obviated or minimized by the metal working fluid of the present invention. Unlike some metal working fluids which require that components react with each other to form the metal working fluid, the metal working composition of the present invention may be synthesized by merely mixing the components together. Although many metal working fluids do not require that the components chemically react with each other, many compositions require a high proportion of relatively more expensive active ingredients to relatively less expensive ingredients, thereby increasing the cost of the metal working composition. Some metal working compositions may have the further disadvantage of requiring components which pose a potential health hazard to persons using them. For example, many metal working fluids used in the past contained nitrites, which have recently been recognized as participating in the conversion of certain chemical substances into carcinogens. For example, The UnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency recently promulgated a rule prohibiting the addition of nitrosating agents, such as nitrites, to triethanolamine salts of substituted organic acids when the mixture is to be used in metal working fluids due to the carcenogenic propensity of such materials demonstrated in animal studies Federal Register, Vol. 49 No. 116, June 14, 1984, Rules and Regulations .This difficulty is avoided by the present invention, which exhibits good metal working properties without containing nitrosating agents. In general, the present invention is a watersoluble, metal working composition which includes a relatively large alkoxylated amine, an alkanol amine and an acid derived compound, wherein the large alkoxylated amine is generally described by the formula EMI4.1 Consistent with this formula, R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl moieties, alkoxy moieties and polyalkoxy moieties, R2 is selected from the group consisting of C7 and larger hydrocarbyl moieties, and R3 is selected from the group consisting of alkoxy moieties and polyalkoxy moieties. The alkanol amine may generally be described by the formula EMI5.1 R4 is selected from the group consistent of hydrogen,C1 C6 hydrocarbyl moieties, and monomeric and polymeric alkoxy moieties consisting essentially of alkoxy units selected from the group consisting of ethoxy, 2 propoxy, 2 butoxy and mixtures thereof. R5 is selected from the group consisting of C1 C6 hydrocarbyl moieties, and monomeric and polymeric alkoxy moieties consisting essentially of alkoxy units selected from the group consisting of ethoxy, 2 propoxy, 2 butoxy and mixtures thereof. R6 is selected from the group consisting of monomeric and polymeric alkoxy moieties consisting essentially of alkoxy units selected from the group consisting of ethoxy, 2 propoxy, 2 butoxy and mixtures thereof. R4, R5 and R6 are additionally selected so that the alkanol amine contains a total of 6 or fewer alkoxy units. The acid derived compound included in the present invention is selected from the group consisting of inorganic acids, organic acids, and salts thereof. The present invention is a water soluble, metalworking composition comprising a relatively large alkoxylated amine, an alkanol amine and an acid derived compound. According to the invention, the large alkoxylated amine is a relatively large amine which may be generally described by the formula EMI6.1 R2 is a relatively large hydrocarbon group selected from the group consisting C7 and larger hydrocarbyl moieties. These hydrocarbyl moieties are generally alkyl or alkenyl in character, but may be an aryl moiety such as benzyl, methyl benzyl or dimethoxy benzyl, and alkyl phenyls such as nonyl phenyl. However, alkyl and alkenyl moieties are preferred. Polyalkoxy groups are not included. About C12 to about C20 hydrocarbyl moieties, such as stearyl, oleyl, palmyl, linoleyl, soya, lauryl, myristyl and tallow, are more preferred.Stearyl, oleyl, soya, coco and tallow moieties are most preferred. R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl moieties, alkoxy moieties and polyalkoxy moieties. The hydrocarbyl moieties may be aryl, alkyl or alkenyl in character, such as phenyl, stearyl, oleyl, soya, coco and tallow. Alkyl or alkenyl groups are preferred. Although R1 may be selected independent of R2, when R1 is hydrocarbyl it is preferred that R1 be the same as R2 due to the relative cost efficiency of preparing the alkoxylated amine when, instead of being different hydrocarbyl moieties, bothR1 and R2 are the same. Preferably, however, R1 is an alkoxy or a polyalkoxy moiety, consistent with those defined for R3. R3 may only be selected from the group consisting of alkoxy and polyalkoxy moieties. Preferably, these alkoxy and polyalkoxy moieties consist essentially of alkoxy units generally described by the following formula. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the oxygen of alkoxy moieties and the terminal oxygen of polyalkoxy moieties is bonded to hydrogen, not shown in the above formula, to form a terminal hydroxy group.EMI7.1 R7 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C1 C28 hydrocarbyl moieties, such as alkyl groups like methyl, ethyl and propyl. More preferably, R7 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, so that the alkoxy unit is an ethoxy, 2 propoxy or 2 butoxy unit, respectively. Ethoxy and propoxy units, whereinR7 is hydrogen or methyl, respectively, are even more preferred. Although R3 may be a polyalkoxy moiety consisting of a mixture of different alkoxy units, such as a mixture of ethoxy units and propoxy units, it is more preferred that R3 be homogenous. Hydroxy ethyl and homogenous polyethoxy moieties are most preferred. Although R1 may be selected independently fromR3, when R1 is an alkoxy or polyalkoxy moiety, it is preferred that R1 consist essentially of at least some of the same alkoxy units as R3 in order to simplify preparation of the tertiary alkoxylated amine. For example, when R3 is a polyalkoxy moiety of mixed ethoxy and propoxy units, it is preferred that R1 be hydroxy ethyl, hydroxy propyl, polyethoxy, polypropoxy or a polyalkoxy moiety of mixed ethoxy and propoxy units. Similarly, when R3 is a polyethoxy moiety, it is preferred that R1 be hydroxy ethyl, polyethoxy or a mixed polyalkoxy moiety of ethoxy units R1 and other alkoxy units. Most preferably, however,both R1 and R3 consist essentially of the same kind of alkoxy units. In the preferred embodiment R1 and R3 are chosen such that the total number of alkoxy units on the large alkoxylated amine is equal to 2 to about 35.For example, the total number of alkoxy groups may be equal to 2 when each of R1 and R3 is hydroxy ethyl, or when R3 is a polyethoxy moiety consisting of 2 ethoxy units and R1 is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl moiety such as tallow. More preferably, the total number of alkoxy units in said large alkoxylated amine is equal to about 5 to about 20, such as whereR3 is a polyethoxy moiety consisting of three ethoxy units, and R1 is a polyethoxy moiety consisting of two ethoxy units. Relatively large alkoxylated amines consistent with the preferred embodiment of the invention are commercially available from the Borg WarnerCorporation under the trademark wPEGAMEEN . The alkanol amine of the present invention is a relatively small amine, and may be generally described by the formula EMI8.1 R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 C6 hydrocarbyl moieties such as methyl, phenyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl, and monomeric and polymeric alkoxy moieties. When R4 is a monomeric or polymeric alkoxy moiety, the alkoxy moiety consists essentially of alkoxy units selected from the group consisting of ethoxy, 2 propoxy, 2 butoxy and mixtures thereof. For example, when R4 is a monomeric alkoxy moiety, R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydroxy ethyl HO CH2CH2 , 2 hydroxy propyl CH3CH OH CH2 , and 2 hydroxy butyl C83CH2CH OH CH2 moieties. Although R4 may be a polymeric alkoxy moiety, such as polyethoxy HOCH2CH 2OCH2 CH2 or polypropoxy CH3CH OH CH2OCH CH3 CH2 , R4 preferably is a simple alkoxy moiety, such as hydroxy ethyl or 2 hydroxy propyl, a simple hydrocarbyl such as methyl, ethyl, or hydrogen, such as in dimethyl ethanol amine, N phenyl ethanol amine, and N,N diethyl ethanol amine. Hydroxy ethyl and hydrogen are most preferred, such as when the alkanol amine is triethanol amine, diethanol amine or N methyl ethanol amine. R5 may be selected from the group consisting ofC1 C6 hydrocarbyl moieties, as discussed above forR4, and monomeric and polymeric alkoxy moieties which consist essentially of alkoxy units selected from the group consisting of ethoxy, 2 propoxy, 2 butoxy and mixtures thereof, as discussed above for R4. However, unlike R4, R5 may not be hydrogen. Consequently, although the alkanol amine may be a secondary or tertiary amine, the alkanol amine may not be a primary amine. In the embodiment of the invention which is most preferred, R5 is methyl, as in N methyl ethanol amine or dimethyl ethanol amine, or hydroxy ethyl, as in diethanol amine or triethanol amine. R6 may be a monomeric or polymeric alkoxy moiety consisting essentially of alkoxy units selected from the group consisting of ethoxy, 2 propoxy, 2 butoxy, and mixtures thereof, as discussed above for R4. Preferably, R6 is hydroxy ethyl or 2 hydroxy propyl. Hydroxy ethyl is more preferred. Triethanol amine, N methyl ethanol amine and mixtures thereof are most preferred. It should further be noted that although each ofR4, R5 and R6 may be a polymeric alkoxy group, the alkanol amine may contain no more than a total of 6 alkoxy units. However, fewer than 6 alkoxy units are preferred, such as in triethanol amine, diethanol amine and N methyl ethanol amine, wherein the total number of alkoxy units is equal to or less than 3. The composition of the present invention also contains an acid derived compound. This acid derived compound may be an organic acid, an inorganic acid or a salt derived from an organic or inorganic acid by the replacement of an acidic hydrogen by another appropriate cation. Preferred organic acid derived compounds include acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, benzoic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, para toluene sulfonic acid, sebacic acid, and amino acids such as alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, glycine, tyrosine, serine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In the embodiment of the invention which is most preferred, the acid derived compound is an inorganic acid, with phosphoric acid, nitric acid and sulfuric acid being preferred. Boric acid is not preferred.Phosphoric acid is most preferred. In an alternative embodiment which is less preferred than those discussed above, the acid derived compound may be a salt of an organic or inorganic acid, and preferably is a salt of the preferred acids discussed above. When the acid derived compound is a salt, it is preferred that the acid derived compound be aGroup VIII metal, alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal or amine salt. Examples of salts consistent with this embodiment include iron phosphates, ammonium sulfates and sodium nitrates. It has been found that the composition of the present invention, as described, provides a metalworking composition in which time consuming and costly component preparation may be avoided, and yet achieve excellent cooling, high lubricity, and extreme pressure properties. Further, the composition of the present invention may exhibit high thermal and hydrolytic stability, while inhibiting the development of rust on the workpiece and equipment. Some formulations, such as those containing N methyl ethanol amine as some or all of the alkanol amine component, may also exhibit a lowered susceptibility to the growth of mold and bacteria. The ratio of the ingredients for optimum performance in a particular application, such as extremepressure properties, can be adjusted as needed. It is preferred, however, that the ratio by weight of the alkanol amine to the relatively large alkoxylated amine be about 20 1 to about 0.05 1. More preferably, however, the ratio by weight of the alkanol amine to the large alkoxylated amine is about 10 1 to about 0.1 1, with a ratio of about 7 1 to about 0.5 1 being most preferred. When the ratio of the alkanol amine to the relatively large alkoxylated amine is about 20 1 to about 0.05 1, it is preferred that the ratio by weight of the acid derived compound to the large alkoxylated amine be about 3 1 to about 0.01 1. Ratios of acidderived compound to large alkoxylated amine of about 1.5 1 to about 0.1 1, however, are more preferred. Due to space and weight considerations, the composition of the present invention usually will be stored and shipped in a relatively concentrated form. Although this concentrate may contain no significant quantities of water, the composition usually will be shipped and stored as an aqueous solution which contains 10 60 by weight, and preferably 20 50 by weight, of the rela tively large alkoxylated amine, the alkanol amine and the acid derived compound combined. Although the composition of the present invention may be used in a concentrated form, due to the fact that a significant portion of the cost of a lubricating composition generally is for the active components rather than the carrier medium, e.g. water or oil, it is generally preferred that the amount of metal working composition in a lubricant or coolant be as low as practically possible.As suggested by the examples discussed below, the composition of the present invention may be used in the form of highly dilute aqueous solutions without adversely affecting the lubricity, extreme pressure or anti wear properties of the invention, In the preferred embodiment, the composition is an aqueous solution which includes at least 85 by weight water, based on the total weight of the solution, and about 0.1 to 15 by weight of the combined large alkoxylated amine, alkanol amine and the acid derived compound, although, as is known to those skilled in the art, the appropriate concentration will vary depending on the application. More preferably, however, the large alkoxylated amine, the alkanol amine and the acid derived compound together constitute about 0.5 to about 10 by weight of the solution, with about 0.5 to 5 being most preferred. It is further preferred that the pH of the composition be equal to about 7.5 to about 10.5 in order to minimize the corrosive effects of the composition on the workpiece pH s in the range of about 8 to about 9.5 are more preferred. Consistent with the invention, pH1s in the preferred ranges may be attained by adjusting the proportions of the various components to each other, and or by adding other components, such as acids or bases, to maintain the proper pH balance. Other components may also be added to assist in solubilizing the composition in water, although these are not usually necessary. Other known additives, such as biocides, dyes, perfumes, antifoam compounds, crystal growth modifiers, scale inhibitors and chelating agents for hard water use may also be included.
