# Apparatus for ion implantation.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a system for implanting ions into a target element including a source arrangement 230 for producing an ion beam a beam analyzing arrangent for receiving the ion beam and selectively separating various ion species in the beam on the basis of mass to produce an analyzed beam and a beam resolving arrangent disposed in the path of the analyzed beam for permitting a preselected ion species to pass to the target element. The ion source arrangement 230 comprises an arc chamber 230C having an elongate exit aperture 232 , and an elongate filament cathode 230D . Bias and operating potentials are provided for the source arrangement and gaseous material to be ionized is supplied to the chamber. The ion source 230 utilises an electromagnet arrangement 280 having poles 281 aligned with the source filament 230D for causing the electrons emitted by the filament to spiral around and create ions of the gaseous material supplied to the chamber 230C and to compensate for non uniformity in the ion beam emitted along the chamber, current to the field coils of the magnet for each pole is controlled independently.
