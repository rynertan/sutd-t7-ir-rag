## Description
The present invention relates to novel 2,3 dihydro 1H indene derivatives and salts thereof having excellent activities for improving anoxemic and hypoxic symptoms and syndromes accompanied therewith, as well as having excellent anti inflammatory, hypotensive, gastric juice secretion inhibitory actions, and further having excellent immunosupressive actions. Thus, the novel 2,3 dihydro 1H indene derivatives and salts thereof are useful as improving agents for treating anoxemic and hypoxic symptoms and syndromes accompanied therewith, cerebral activators, amnesia curative agents, presbyophrenia curative agents, treating agents for breathing arrest and improving agents for hypoxia accompanied with potassium cyanide poisoning, as well as they are useful as prophylactics for arrhythmia and heart failure caused by hypoxia, as well as they are useful as anti inflammatory agents, hypotensive agents. Oxygen is one of the essential elements to the living body for sustaining the life through release of energies and metabolisms. In the living body, oxygen is converted into so called active oxygen radicals , for example, oxygen anion radicals, peroxide ion, hydroxy radical, etc. in various biochemical reactions, such as energy releasing reactions, enzymatic reactions, and other reactions caused by exposures in ultraviolet rays and various radiations. The active oxygen radicals are indeed useful for the actions of oxygenase and phagocytosis carried out by leucocytes. On the other hand, the active oxygen radicals promote peroxidation reaction of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and arachidonic acid, etc. These unsaturated fatty acid and existing abundantly in the living body, and are the main constituents of the biomembranes. The peroxidation reaction of the unsaturated fatty acids produce peroxidized substances such as peroxidized lipids. Similar to the active oxygen radicals, said peroxidized substances also produce alkoxy radicals and hydroxy radicals which will attack the biomembranes and will result disorder of the biomembranes and deactivation of various useful enzymes working in the living body. Cf. TAISHA Metabolisms , Vol. 15, No. 10, 1978 , Special issue of active oxygen. On the other hand, there are existing some other enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase hereinafter referred to as SOD , catalase, glutathion peroxidase, etc. in the living body. These enzymes prevent the deactivation of metabolism from the attack of the active oxygen radicals. Additionally, there are existing several vitamins, such as tocopherols vitamin E groups having antioxidative activities in the living body. Generally, the normal homeostasis of the living body is sustained by the actions of these enzymes and vitamins having antioxidative activities. However, sometimes the phylaxis mechanisms of the living body being suitably maintained by the actions of these enzymes and vitamins may be defected by certain reasons, and the formation of the active oxygen radicals in an amount exceeds to the ability of the phylaxis mechanism of the living body, as well as the formation and accumulation of the peroxidized substances are observed. In such cases that the phylaxis mechanism of the living body is defected, then several severe disorders such as various diseases caused by the aggregation of the platelets, inflammations, disorder of the liver, arteriosclerosis, hemolysis, senescene or presbyopherenia, retinosis, disorder of the lungs, disorders of the heart and the lungs caused by the actions of certain drugs, ischemic coronary heart disease and the like will be occurred accompnaied with the progressive chain reactions of the peroxidation. Hitherto, compounds having actions for scavenging the active oxygen radicals which are considered to be the main factors of the above mentioned various diseases, and for preventing or lowering the formation and accumulation of the peroxidized substances in the living body were known and called as antioxidants. A number of studies on prophylaxis and curative effects by using these antioxidants have been reported in related literatures.
