# SIDE LIFT JACK FOR UNIBODY AUTOMOBILES

## Abstract
A jack for side lifting of four wheel vehicles into tilted disposition is disclosed wherein elongated, rectilinear lifting arm means 12 is provided which is of a length to extend substantially across the track dimension of the vehicle when the arm means 12 is inserted under the vehicle from one side thereof. Extensible fluid actuated means 14 is operably connected to the normally outboard end of the lifting arm means 12 for raising the arm means 12 through an arc to engage and lift one side of the vehicle as the arm means 12 pivots about the inboard end thereof which rests on the ground. The jack is especially useful for raising one side of smaller unibody automobiles without damage to the body or operating components.
