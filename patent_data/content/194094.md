# Friction element, especially for drum brakes.

## Abstract
A friction element with a rivetted friction lining, especially for highly stressed drum brakes, in which the mating surface 5 of the friction lining 2 to the lining carrier 1 and or the op posing surface 6 of the lining carrier 1 to the friction layer 2 is provided with a multiplicity of particles 7 which are harder than the material of the opposing surface 6 of the lining carrier 1 .
