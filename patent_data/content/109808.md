# An improved apparatus for the manufacture of photovoltaic devices.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an apparatus and assembly 50 for manu facturing photovoltaic devices of the type including a plurality of layers of semiconductor materials by depositing the materials onto a substrate 11 from a microwave energy excited plasma. The asembly includes a deposition chamber 30 a source of microwave energy, and an antenna 64 extending into the chamber 30 and coupled to the micro wave energy source. The antenna 64 includes an outer sheath formed from a conductive material, an inner conduc tor extending within and electrically insulated from the outer sheath, and a slot within the outer sheath. The assembly also includes a new and improved feed through 130 for the antenna permitting the antenna to extend into the chamber while establishing a vacuum seal between the chamber and the antenna. The apparatus includes a plurality of deposition cham bers each chamber arranged to deposit a respective one of the layers of semiconductor materials onto the substrate as the substrate is advanced therethrough. At least one of the deposition chambers is arranged as above.
