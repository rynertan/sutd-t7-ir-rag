# Flash X ray source.

## Abstract
A high intensity spot focus soft x ray source is de scribed. The source produces a spectrum in the range from about 5 Å to 300 Å, with maximum power in the neigh borhood of tens of angstroms. The flash intensity of the flash source is in the neighborhood of 10¹⁷ x ray photons per flash. The source has an anode 10 , and a cathode 12 which is spaced apart from the anode and has a protrusion 14 thereon. An insulating body 16 having a passage 18 therethrough is positioned between the anode and the cathode. The passage and the protrusion are axially aligned. At least one viewing port 20 for the passage is provided.
