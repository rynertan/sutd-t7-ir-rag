# Duct means for aircraft.

## Abstract
A duct 11 for an aircraft comprises a flexible pane member 18 which is normally held in a non fluid conducting condition adjacent the surface of the aircraft body by biass tension means 12, 13, so as to define a substantially continuous surface. On introduction of fluid pressure be tween the panel and the aircraft body, the panel member inflated to overcome the biass of the tension means 12, 13, and to expand to a fluid conducting condition of relatively large cross sectional area, upstanding from the surrounding aircraft surface regions.
