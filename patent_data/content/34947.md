# Multi element lens system.

## Abstract
A multi element lens system has a central cavity 24 containing a heavy, high index gas such as a haloalkane. The central cavity is defined by two of the lens elements B,C and the gas in it acts as a thick positive lens. The pressure of the gas in the cavity is varied in response to magnification changes desired, the pressure change causing a change in the refractive index of the gas thereby altering the focal length of the lens.
