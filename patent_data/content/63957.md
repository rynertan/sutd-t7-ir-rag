# Separation of isopropyl alcohol from TBA tebol by selective adsorption.

## Abstract
Minor amounts of isopropyl alcohol are removed from a process stream primarily comprising tertiary butyl alcohol by means of an adsorbent having asymetric apertures greater than five angstroms in length and less than five angstroms in width, preferably a carbanaceous adsorbent.
