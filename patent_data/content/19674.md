## Description
HOLLOW CATALYST CARRIER AND HOLLOW CATALYST MADE OF TRANSITION ALUMINA AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF The present invention relates to a hollow catalyst carrier and to a hollow catalyst made of a transitionalumina and to a process for the production thereof. More particularly, it relates to a hollow catalyst carrier and hollow catalyst which are made of a transition alumina and which have a very large pore volume and a very large specific surface area, and to a process for the production thereof. It is well known that ceramic hollow products, particularly those having a multi cell structure, have a number of uniform and parallel flow paths. Accordingly, they have a decreased pressure drop and a uniform distribution of gas flow within the structure. Also, they have a large effective surface area per unit weight thereof because of their thin walls. Moreover, the products are very strong, while they are light in weight, and further have an excellent heat resistance. In view of these various advantages, the ceramic hollow products have hitherto been used as catalyst carriers, supporting materials for various products, heat exchangers, heat insulating materials and sound insulating materials.Particularly, because of the excellent impact strength and wear characteristics thereof, an integral product of the ceramic hollow products has been watched as a catalyst carrier for the treatment of automobile exhaust gases and for the removal of nitrogen oxides. The ceramic hollow products are usually produced from cordierite prepared by calcining a mixture of talc, bentonite, 4alumina, etc., spodumene, Aralumina, titania, zirconia, mullite, calcined kaolin, or the like. The ceramic products obtained from cordierite, spodumene, alumina or mullite have very good characteristics as catalyst carriers because of their excellent mechanical strength and low thermal expansion. However, these ceramic hollow products usually have such a low specific surface area less than 5 mê g and such a small pore volume less than 0.2 cm3 g , that they are inferior in carrying the catalytically active components and are not necessarily suitable as a catalyst carriers. In order to enhance their ability to carry the catalyst components, the ceramic products are usually coated with an activated alumina having good catalyst component carrying properties by conventional methods, such as dipping or spraying. However, the products are still inferior in their durability, because the coating of activated alumina is only weakly adhered to the surface of the ceramic and is peeled off during use of the catalyst. We have now found that an integral hollow product of a transition alumina having a large pore volume and a large specific surface area has excellent properties for carrying catalyst components and hence is useful as a catalyst carrier. Accordingly, the present invention provides a hollow catalyst carrier which comprises a calcined product comprising predominantly a transition alumina and having a void ratio in the cross section of not less than 3 , a specific surface area of not less than 5 mê g, a bulk density of 0.8 to 1.8 g cm3, a pore volume of 0.3 to 0.8 cm3 g, a compressive strength in the extrusion direction of not less than 20 kg cmê and at least one hole in the extrusion direction, the calcined product being prepared by subjecting a powder containing a rehydratable alumina to extrusion molding, rehydrating the molded product and calcining. The bulk density of the hollow catalyst carrier of the invention is the density of the non void part and is measured by the method disclosed in JIS R 2205. The present invention also provides a hollow catalyst which comprises a catalytically active component carried on a calcined product comprising predominantly a transition alumina and having a void ratio in the cross section of not less than 3 , a specific surface area of not less than 5 m2 g, a bulk density of 0.8 to 1.8 gjcm2, a compressive strength in the extrusion direction of not less than 20 kg cm2 and at least one hole in the extrusion direction, the calcined product being prepared by subjecting a powder containing a rehydratable alumina to extrusion molding, rehydrating the molded product and calcining.The hollow catalyst of the present invention may be produced by impregnating catalytically active components onto the hollow catalyst carrier obtained above. The transition alumina used in the catalyst carrier of the present invention includes alumina having a large specific surface area which is identified as the nr P and S forms by X ray diffraction, and comprises predominantly alumina. The hollow product produced by the extrusion molding includes all products having various hole shapes, such as circular or rectangular, and the products may be in the form of a pipe which has a single opening or a multi cell honeycomb structure which has 400 to 600 holes per a square inch. The hollow catalyst carrier and hollow catalyst made of a transition alumina of the present invention are prepared by using a rehydratable alumina as the starting material. The rehydratable alumina includes all transitionaluminas other than Alumina which are obtained by subjecting alumina hydrate to heat decomposition, for example, alumina or amorphous alumina. The transition alumina can be obtained industrially by contacting an alumina hydrate, such as alumina trihydrate which is obtained by the Bayer process, with a heated gas at about 400 to 1200 C for a fraction of a second to 10 seconds, or by heating the alumina hydrate under reduced pressure at about 250 900 C for about 1 minute to 4 hours.The loss on ignition of such a transition alumina is about 0.5 to 15 by weight. The rehydratable alumina usually has a particle size of not more than about 50 zand is used in an amount of at least about 10 by weight, i.e. 10 to 100 by weight1 preferably not less than 20 by weight, more preferably not less than about 30 by weight, based upon the total weight of the solid materials, i.e. the materials composing the hollow catalyst carrier and the hollow catalyst. Solid materials other than the rehydratable alumina are not specified but include conventional inorganic materials which are usually used for producing catalyst carriers, such as alumina, silica, alumina hydrate, clay, talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, zeolite, corderite, spodumene, titania, zirconia, silica sol, alumina sol, mullite and also includes combustible materials and various catalytically active components. These solid materials composing the hollow catalyst carrier other than the rehydratable alumina are used in an amount of less than about 90 by weight, i.e. O to less than 90 by weight, preferably less than 80 by weight, more preferably less than 70 by weight, based upon the total weight of the solid materials. The combustible materials are used in order to increase the pore volume on the thin wall of the final hollow catalyst carrier or hollow catalyst, and include all combustible materials which are usually used in the production of activated alumina having a large pore volume.Suitable examples of the combustible materials are wood scraps, cork particles, powdery coal, active carbon, charcoal, crystalline cellulose powder, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, starch, sucrose, gluconic acid, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyethylene, polystyrene, or a mixture thereof. The larger the ratio of the combustible materials, the larger the macropore volume on the thin wall of the final hollow catalyst carrier or hollow catalyst.However, when the amount of the combustible materials is too large and the macropore volume is too large, the strength of the final product is decreased. Accordingly, the suitable amount and kind of the combustible material should be selected in accordance with the uses of the catalyst carrier and also catalyst. The hollow catalyst carrier and hollow catalyst can be produced by using as the starting material the rehydratable alumina and other solid materials as mentioned above in the following manner 1 The rehydjatable alumina is partially or wholly coated with an agent for preventing the rehydration, and then is mixed with water and or a water containing substance and optionally also other solid materials than the rehydratable alumina and further a binding agent, and the mixture is kneaded well to give a plastic mixture. The resulting plastic mixture is subjected to extrusion molding by using a pipe or multi cell forming dies. The extrusion molded product thus obtained is subjected to rehydration and optionally followed by drying, and then is activated by calcining. 2 Alternatively, the rehydratable alumina is mixed with a non aqueous substance which is liquid at a temperature of lower than 1000C and optionally other solid materials than the rehydratable alumina and also a binding agent, and the mixture is kneaded well to give a plastic mixture. The resulting plastic mixture is treated in the same manner as in the above 1 , i.e. to be subjected to the extrusion molding, rehydration, optionally drying, and finally calcination. For the production of an extrusion molded product from a ceramic powder, water and or a water containing substance is usually added to the starting ceramic mixture in order to give plasticity to the ceramic mixture. However, when the rehydratable alumina is mixed with water and or a water containing substance, the alumina is rehydrated and hence is exothermally cured during the extrusion molding, by which the extrusion molding can not be accomplished and the desired hollow catalyst carrier or hollow catalyst having good inner and outer walls particularly, good inner wall can not be obtained.Accordingly, in the present invention, the rehydratable alumina is previously coated with an agent for preventing rehydration before admixing with water or water containing substance and other solid materials, or is mixed with a liquid non aqueous substance without using water or a water containing substance. The agent for preventing rehydration includes all substances which can prevent the rehydration of the rehydratable alumina during the extrusion molding, particularly organic substances which are solid at room temperature and have a solubility of less than about 20 by weight, preferably less than about 10 by weight, in water at room temperature, and organic substances which are liquid at room temperature and have a solubility of less than about 50 by weight, preferably less than about 25 by weight, in water at room tem perature. Suitable examples of the redydration prevent ing agent are fatty acids and their salts, such as caproic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, glycolic acid, capric acid, stearic acid, salicylic acid, trimethylacetic acid, lauric acid, cerotic acid, cinnamic acid, malonic acid, myristic acid, sebacic acid, benzoic acid, or maleic anhydride sulfonic or phosphoric acid deriva tives of these fatty acids alcohols such as t butyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohql, stearyl alcohol, cyclohxanol, menthol, cholesterol, or naphthol amines such as laurylamine, tetramethylenediamine, diethanolamine, or diphenylamine alkanes such as n heptadecane, n octadecane, n nonadecane, or n eicosane aromatic compounds such as naphthalene, diphenyl, or anthracene waxes natural high molecular weight compounds such as starches, casein, cellulose or its derivatives, or alginates synthetic high molecular weight compounds such as polyethylene, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, poly sodium acrylate , polybutadiene, isoprene rubber, or urethane resin paraffins such as liquid paraffin, soy been oil, rape seed oil, light oil, or kerosene carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid, or pelargonic acid aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, or cumene or the like. The rehydration preventing agent is used in such an amount that the surface of the rehydratable alumina is at least partially coated with it by mixing directly with the alumina powder or by using a suitable means, for example, when the agent is solid and hence it is difficult to directly coat onto the alumina powder, by coating after being dissolved in an appropriate solvent such as an alcohol or ether, or when the agent is liquid, by dipping the alumina powder into the rehydration preventing agent or by coating with the vaporized agent, or in combination of these means. Suitable amount of the rehydration preventing agent depends on the particle size distribution of the solid materials composing the hollow catalyst carrier, compositions, conditions for extrusion and also conditions for rehydration, but is usually in the range of 0.01 to 30 by weight based on the weight of the rehydratable alumina.When the amount of the rehydration preventing agent is smaller than 0.01 by weight, the prevention of rehydration can not sufficiently be done, and the product is exothermically cured during the extrusion molding. When the rehydration preventing agent is used also as the binding agent as mentioned hereinafter, the amount may be increased up to the maximum amount of the binding agent. The binding agent used for the production of the present hollow catalyst carrier or hollow catalyst includes all conventional binding agents which are usually used for the production of alumina catalyst carrier, such as polyvinyl alcohol, starches, celluloses, or the like. The amount of the binding agent may also depend on the kind and particle size of the solid materials composing the hollow catalyst carrier or hollow catalyst, conditions for extrusion molding and conditions for rehydration, but is usually not more than 30 by weight based on the weight of the solid materials. When the binding agent is used in a too large amount, the molded product is distorted during the removal of the rehydration preventing agent after extrusion molding, and hence, the product has an inferior dimension stability and a lower strength.When the rehydration preventing agent functions also as a binding agent, only the deficient amount of the binding agent may be supplemented. The rehydration preventing agent and the binding agent are used in a total amount of at least 2.5 by weight based on the weight of the solid materials composing the hollow catalyst carrier or hollow catalyst. When the starting alumina and other solid materials are mixed and kneaded with the non aqueous substance, and if the nonaqueous substance functions as binding agent, any binding agent is no more added, but if the non aqueous substance does not have any binding effect, a binding agent is added in an amount of at least 1.5 by weight. The plastic mixture to be subjected to the extrusion molding may be prepared by subjecting the rehydratable alumina to rehydration preventing treatment, mixing the resulting alumina with other solid materials and a binding agent, and then mixing and kneading the mixture with water or a water containing substance, or in case no rehydration preventing treatment is done, by mixing the rehydratable alumina with other solid materials and a binding agent and then mixing and kneading the mixture with a non aqueous substance. The mixing and kneading of the mixture of solid materials with water or a water containing substance or with a non aqueous substance may be done prior to supplying to the extrusion molding machine, or in case of using an extrusion molding machine having a kneading function, the kneading may be carried out in it. Water and water containing substance may usually be used in an amount of about 20 to 70 by weight based upon the weight of the solid materials. The amount of nonaqueous substance may vary depending on the particle size distribution and components of the solid materials, conditions for the extrusion molding and conditions for the rehydration, but is usually in the range of about 2 to 100 by weight based upon the weight of the rehydratable alumina. The water containing substance includes an aqueous solution of an acid, an alkali, a catalytically active component, a binding agent, or other additives. Non aqueous substance includes. all substances which are liquid at a temperature of lower than about 1000C, for example, alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, or propanol hydrocarbons such as hexane, or heptane polyvalent alcohols such ae ethylene glycol, or glycerin paraffins such as soy bean oil, rape seed oil, light oil, or kerosene carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid, or pelargonic acid esters such as ethyl silicate, or methyl acetate aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, or cumene dioxane or a mixture of these substances.Preferred non aqueous substances are dioxane, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerin, and rape seed oil, which are liquid at the temperature for kneading, i.e. at 100C higher than the room temperature. The extrusion molding does not necessarily require a releasing agent, but a saturated fatty acid or a salt thereof, such as stearic acid, calcium stearate or the like, may be added when the starting mixture is kneaded. These releasing agents are usually used in an amount of O to 5 by weight based upon the weight of the solid materials. The extrusion molding can be carried out by any type of extrusion molding machine which can form a pipe like or multi cell structural molded product having a void ratio in a cross section of not less than 3 , i.e. 3 to 95 , preferably 20 to 90 , for example, an extrusion molding machine which can give multi cell structural molded products as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,559,252, Japanese PatentPublication No. 1232 1976 and Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 55960 1973 that which can give multi cell structural molded products having fins which extend from the thin wall toward the center of core in order to improve the contact efficiency of the gas to be treated which passes through the core of the catalyst carrier or catalyst, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No.127886 1975 that which can give multi cell structural molded products wherein at least one direction of thin wall is bent in the extrusion direction in order to prevent cracking and distortion of the product due to expansion or shrinkage of the multi cell forming materials during the drying or calcining of the product, as disclosed in JapanesePatent Publication unexamined No. 565 1976 and that which can give multi cell structural products having a collaring on the surrounding thin wall or having a surrounding thick wall in order to improve the impact strength of the product. The hollow products of the present invention can also be produced by injection molding and transfer molding. The outer shape and the hole shape of the hollow products may be in any geometrical form such as square, rectangle, triangle, hexagon, circle, or the like. Furthermore, number of hole, wall thickness of cells, length of the molded products, sectional area of each cell, and the total sectional area of the hollow product outer shape having the pipe like or multi cell structure may appropriately be determined depending on the use of the products. The hollow products obtained by extrusion molding are subjected to the rehydration treatment in order to enhance the impact strength and mechanical strength. The rehydration treatment can give the hollow products sufficient strengths without forming ceramic bond by sintering. The rehydration can be done by the conventional methods which are used in the production of activated alumina, and is usually carried out at a temperature of from room temperature to 15QOC, preferably by keeping in steam or steam containing gas having a temperature of 80 to 1000C, or by keeping in water at room temperature or higher, more preferably at higher than 800C.When the used rehydration preventing agent is insoluble in water at the above temperature range for rehydration, such as polyvinyl chloride, the hollow products are immersed in an appropriate solvent such as alcohols, ethers, or esters, by which the coating layer is destroyed or dissolved out and the hollow products are rehydrated with water which is contained in the molded products When a non aqueous substance having a solubility of not less than 5 by weight at room temperature is used, the rehydration may preferably be carried out under mild conditions, for instance, by using water diluted with a hydrophilic solvent e.g. alcohols or by carrying out in steam, in view of shape retention of the products. The rehydration is usually be carried out for about one minute to one week. When the rehydration time is longer and the rehydration temperature is higher, the bonding reaction of the hollow products proceeds more and hence there can be obtained the products having a larger. mechanical strength. When the rehydration temperature is higher, the rehydration time can be made shorter. The rehydration may also be done by allowing to keep the product in a sealed vessel at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure for a long period of time. The rehydrated hollow products thus obtained are then dried by natural drying, hot air drying, or vacuum drying, by which moisture adhered onto the products is removed, an thereafter, the products are further heat treated at about 100 to 11000C, by which moisture included within the products is removed and the products are activated. The drying step is not essential, but the hollow products may directly be subjected to calcination with mildly raising temperature, for example, the hollow products are calcined at room temperature to 3000C for 48 hours and then at 300 to 11600C for 6 to 12 hours. When the hollow products contain any combustible material, the products are heated at higher than about 250 OC during the calcination, by which the combustible material is removed. When the removal of the combustible material and the activation of the hollow products are simultaneously carried out, the hollow products containing combustible material is put on a bed and thereto a hot air or combustion gas containing a sufficient amount of oxygen is passed. The hollow catalyst carrier obtained above is composed of crystalline phase of transition alumina comprising predominantly r alumina and has a specified surface area of not less than 5 mê g, preferably 10 to 500 mê g, a bulk density of 0.8 to 1.8 g cm , a pore volume of 0.3 to 0.8 cm3 g, a compressive strength of no less than 20 kg cm2, 2.preferably 30 to 500 kg cm , in the extrusion direction, and further has a multi cell structure having wall thickness of less than 1 mm as like as the conventional multi cell structural catalyst carrier made of ceramic. The hollow catalyst carrier of the present invention is distinguished from the conventional spherical or cylindrical catalyst carrier made of an activated alumina in the fact that the hollow products of the present invention have a void ratio in a cross section of not less than 3 , and have a larger specific surface area and larger pore volume and hence can be used for the treatment of exhaust gases with less pressure drop in comparison with the conventional spherical or cylindrical catalyst carrier. Moreover, the mechanical strength such as a compressive strength of the hollow products is given by the rehydration treatment followed by calcination at 100 to 11000C contrary to the conventional ceramic hollow products wherein the products are sintered at such a high temperature as 1200 to 2000or and thereby the strength is given by the ceramic bonding.Thus, since the hollow catalyst carrier of the present invention can be produced by calcining at a lower temperature, the cost for calcination apparatus, maintenance of the apparatus and fuel is very low. The hollow products obtained above may further be modified by incorporating a specific substance into the starting solid materials or by impregnating a specific substance into the hollow products in order to fit them to specific uses, such as a catalyst carrier for automobile which requires a greater heat resistance and impact strength.For instance, an organic silicon compound is added to the solid materials composing the hollow products or is carried on the hollow products before or after the rehydration treatment. The organic silicon compound incorporated into or carried on the hollow products is oxidized or heatdecomposed during the subsequent calcination step and thereby the hollow products show durable activity for a long period of time owing to the delayed transition of r alumina to a alumina. The organic silicon compound includes all compounds which can release silicon dioxide by oxidation or heat decomposition thereof, for example, organoacetoxysilanes such as acetoxytrimethylsilane, acetoxytriethyl slane, diasetoxydimethylsilane, or diacetoxydiethylsilane organoalkoxysilanes such as methoxytriethylsilane, or dimethoxydimethylsilane organodisilanes such as hexamethyldisilane, or hexaethyldisilane organo silanols such as trimethylsilanol, dimethylphenylsilanol, triethylsilanol, diethylsilanol, or triphenylsilanol organosilanecarboxyli acids organosilmethylene, organopolysiloxane organohydrogenosilane organopolysilane silicone tetrachloride or the like. The organic silicon compound is incorporated into or carried on the hollow products in an amount of 0.01 to 30 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 by weight, Cconverted into SiO2 based upon the weight of the alumina. Use of the silicon compound in an amount of over 30 by weight is not favorable from the economical view point, and on the other hand, use of smaller than 0,01 by weight is not favorable from the viewpoint of less effect on the improvement of heat resistance. It is not made clear why the catalyst carrier made of transition alumina is maintained with less decrease of the reactivity and has an excellent impact strength and heat resistance for a long period of time by incorporation or carrying of the organic silicon compound, it is assumed that silicon dioxide derived from the organic silicon compound is very fine and has an extremely high reactivity and hence the silicon dioxide is reacted with the activated alumina con tained in the catalyst carrier to form an alumina silicon dioxide reaction product on the surface of the activated alumina at a temperature at which the activated alumina does not convert into a alumina, and thereby the transition of r alumina into a alumina is inhibited. The hollow catalyst carrier made of a transitionalumina may further be contacted with a mineral acid after the activation treatment, washed with water and then dried, by which there can be obtained a catalyst carrier having a larger macropore volume and having a high activity. Suitable examples of the mineral acid are hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, which are usually used in an aqueous solution having a concentration of about 0.1 to 10N. Contact of the catalyst carrier with the mineral acid is usually carried out by immersing the catalyst carrier in an aqueous solution of a mineral acid for about 10 minutes or longer hen the contacting time is shorter than 10 minutes, the desired effect for enlarging the macropore volume can not be achieved. The contacting temperature is not critical, but is preferably not higher than 1000C. The hollow catalyst of the present invention can be produced by mixing previously the catalytically active components with the solid materials composing the catalyst carrier or by carrying the catalytically active components on the hollow catalyst carrier by conventional methods such as immersing or spraying. When the active component is previously mixed with the solid materials, it is added to the mixture before or after treatment of rehydratable alumina with a rehydration preventing agent, or before or during the kneading of the mixture of solid materials and a non aqueous substance. The catalytically active components useful in the present invention include all components which are usually used for the conventional catalysts carried on an activated alumina carrier. For example, the hollow catalyst containing at least one of platinum cut , ruthenium Ru , rhodium Rh and palladium 2d is used for non selective removal of nitrogen oxides NOx from exhaust gases from various stationary origins such as factories, selective removal of NOx by reduction with NH3, oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons or reduction of NOx contained in exhaust gases of automobiles, and deodorizing of various industrial exhaust gases.The hollow catalyst containing at least one of oxides of metals selected from copper Cu , iron FeY, cobalt Co , nickel Ni , manganese Mn and vanadium V is used for selective removal of NOx in exhaust gases by reduction with NH3, oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons or reduction of NOx contained in exhaust gases of automobiles, deodorizing of various industrial exhaust gases, and decomposition of NO.Moreover, the hollow catalyst containing at least one of oxides of metals selected from vanadium V , molybdenum Mo , tangsten W ., chromium Cr , titanium Ti , zinc Zn , zirconium Zr , niobium Nb , silver Ag , cerium Cett tin can , rhenium ores, and tantalum Ta is used for selective removal of NOx of exhaust gases by reduction with NH3, oxidation ofCO and hydrocatbons or reduction of NOx contained in exhaust gases of automobiles. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples but is not limited thereto. In Examples, part means part by weight unless specified otherwise.
