# Modified polyester fiber and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A fiber composed of a polyester having at least a part of terminals blocked with the residue of at least one specific metal sulfonate compound, where the amount of the blocked terminals is 1.3 t0 4.0 mol based on the dicarboxylic acid component of the polyester and the alkali dissolution speed constant is 3.3 x 10 ⁹ to 6.5 x 10 ⁹ cm sec. This polyester has a good dyeability with a cationic dye and is excellent in the heat resistance and alkali resistance. The polyester fiber can be spun at a high speed or super high speed and can be false twisted at a high temperature.
