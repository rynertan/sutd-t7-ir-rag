## Description
A device for cattle boxes.The invention relates to a device for stalling cows separately next to each other, said device consisting of a floor with an edge for putting in position, a delimiting standing up border situated at a distance parallel to that edge, and a number of parallel dividing elements extending between said border and said edge, creating separate lay boxes, together with a barrienbeam extending at a distance above the floor and in front of the border between de dividers.The formation of separate boxes for a milk stall by means of movable tube shaped dividing accessories is known from the Netherlands patent application nr.78.02.256.A similar stalling installation, however, can also form a lay box, i.e. a separate box for a cow. where it can lie down and ruminate.Such a box ought to be sufficiently sized for the cow not only to find a place to lie down but also to be enabled to stand up again.Moreover the cow should not dirt the box with manure and therefore the cow should not enter the box too far.To that end a barrier is positioned in front of the said border, which is called a withers beam, whicbjcauses that the cow is going to lie down at a distance above the border, and so keeps sufficient space to be enabled to move its head.The disadvantage of the so called withers beam is that it impedes the cow to rise,because ttel the head remains under the beam.In the U.S. Patent Specification 3.726.257 a similar device for lay boxes is described, comprising dividing elements and a withers beam.With this device however,the said disadvantage cannot be obviated.The device as mentioned in the introductory part is characterized accor ding to the present invention in that the barrier or withers beam is positioned in an upwards movable way by means of hinges with regard to the delimiting border.So the cow can push up the barrier or withers beam while rising, such that the cow can get standing up upon its forelegs without difficulties and subsequently it can leave the lay.box backwards.In order to obtain standard elements for the cow house device, such that the housing can be extended arbitrarily, it is preferable to apply the barrier only over the width of each box, i.e. extending between the dividing elements, while the barrier is hinged pivotable at least with one divider.In order to keep the weight of the barrier high enough to compel the cow to leave the lay box backwards, each dividing element according to the invention is movable in a vertical plane around a horizontal hinge positioned adjacent to the divider, so that said divider can move upwards with the barrier.In this way the advantage is obtained that the cow cannot get trapped between the floor or the border and the divider.The invention is further elucidated by means of the enclosed drawings, in which a number of exemplary embodiments is shown.In the drawings the following is shown In figure 1 and 2 a perspective view from above is depicted of a part of the cow house device which is provided with divider railings and barriers in the form of two embodiments,by way of examples.In figure 3 a view from above is depicted of a device according to a third embodiment by way of example.In figure 4 a side view is depicted of the device according to figure 3.The cow house installation mainly consists of a floor part 1 provided with an edge for putting in position 2 and parallel to this a delimiting part of wall 3 and at the outer side of the edge 2 there is a passage 4 for entering and manure.Between the delimiting border 3 and the edge 2 there is a number of dividers 5, two of which only having been drawn in figures 1 and 2.At a distance from the border 3 and at a certain height above the floor part 1 a barrier 6 is positioned. The barrier 6 as well as the dividers are made of tube material.In the embodiment according to figure 1 each divider 5 is made of bent pipe, the ends of which being fastened at one side in the border 3 and on the other side in the floor part 1. Thus this relates to affixed divider elements 5.The tube shaped barrier 6 which extends over more than one box space between the dividers 5 is made with an arm 7 positioned perpendicularly upon it, which is connected with a hinge joining at 8 with a divider element 5.The axis of the hinge is horizontal such that the barrier 6 can be moved upwards in the direction of the arrow P1.The barrier 6 normally rests upon the top side of the divider elements 5.Figure 2 shows an embodiment wherein each divider element 5 is provided with a bush 9 which is freely pivotable around a pipe 10 which is positioned along the wall border 3.The divider elements 5 of bent pipe are made each with a support 11 as an abutment against the front side of the border wall 3 in this example.The lower part of the pipe of the divider element 5 extends upwards in an inclined direction and thus a saving a over the part of floor 1 is left.At a distance from tubing 10 the barrier 6 is positioned, consisting in the subject case of a tube shaped part extending only between the dividing elements 5.One end 12 of the tube shaped element 6 is firmly connected with a dividing element 5 in this case.In this embodiment the barrier 6 can move upwards in the direction of the arrow P2, while the dividing element 5 connected with it moves upwards as well in that direction, enabled by the hinge construction around the pipe 10.Figure 3 shows a third example, in which each tube shaped divider element 5 is provided with a supporting part 11 as an abutment upon the floor part 1 at a relatively short distance towards the delimiting part 3 made of tube shaped material.The tube shaped supports of the delimiting element 3 are provided at their upper ends with bushes 13 affixed to same through which a tube 14 is extending which is affixed in it.Each divider element 5 is provided near the tube 14 with two bushes 15.and 16 which are pivotable freely around it, and which are welded upon a supporting plate 17.The supporting plate 17 is furthermore provided with a bush 18, the free end of the tube shaped dividing rail 5 protruding into same. The bush 18 is positioned asymmetrically with regard to the bushes 15 and 16, which is an advantage in the construction of a symmetrical double stalling device.In figure 3 and 4 such a symmetrical double stalling device at both sides of the bordering 3 is constructed, wherein the bushings 15 and 16 can be positioned in such a way with regard to the bushings 15 and 16, that the divider elements 5 and 5 as shown in figure 4 are positioned opposite of each other.The bush 13 upon the support is blocking the divider rails 5 axially.The barrier accessory 6 is constructed in this case in the form of a tube 6 extending between the dividers 5, and said tube is provided with a slot at both ends, through which a bolt 19 is lead.The bolt 19 is further included in a support 20 which is attached to each divider 5.In this manner a pivotable connection is obtained between each barrier 6 and the divider 5 on either side.An upward movement of each barrier 6 is ensured in this case because with that movement either one or both dividers 5 can move upwards too, whereby the increase of distance between the elements 5 can be picked up by a shifting of the barrier 6 in respect of the bolt 19, by means of the slot opening positioned therein.With this construction a very solid and economic embodiment is obtained.It is still observed that the dividers according to the figures 2 and 3 show clearly, that there is sufficient space between the dividers 5 and the floor part 1 such that the livestock will not be enabled to get trapped, and at rising it will have sufficient way for motion by the possibility to lift freely the dividers and the barrier 6. The weight is sufficient,howeverto exercise pressure inconvenient for the animal such that it will be forced to step backwards out of the laybox.The spot of the barrier 6 is determined here in such a manner, that in adaptation to the kind of livestock the animal will not be enabled to enter the lay box too far, so that either in the standing or in resting position of the animal the manure will always be deposited in the manure way 4.The invention is not restricted to the embodiments described in the preceding.
