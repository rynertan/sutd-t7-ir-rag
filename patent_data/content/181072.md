# Motor speed control circuit.

## Abstract
This invention relates to motor speed control circuits employing capacitors. Windings L1 and L2 of a motor are connected in parallel to a neutral phase of an alternating current source. Each coil L1 and L2 may be connected to live phase L of the source whereby the rotation direction of the motor may be altered. Three socket terminals are connected to each winding L1 and L2 . A capacitor pack has three pins with capacitors C1 and C2 connected between a common pin and the two remaining pins. The pins of the capacitor pack can be inserted into the sockets in three different ways whereby either capacitor C1 capacitor C2 , or capacitor C1 and C2 in parallel can be connected across the windings L1, L2 to vary thereby speed and performance characteristics of the motor.
