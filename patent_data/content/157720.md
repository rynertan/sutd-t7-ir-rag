An annular keyway 54 is formed in the cylindrical sidewall of a seat retainer 51 . A key 52 extends from the cylindrical sidewall of an annular recess formed in an axial face of the valve body. The key 52 is received in the keyway 54 and locks the retainer 51 against axial dis lodgement from the valve body 12 .
