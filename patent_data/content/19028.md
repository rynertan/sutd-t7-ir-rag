# A conveyor arrangement.

## Abstract
A conveyor belt comprising a plurality of links whose mutually opposite end parts are pivotally connected to the end parts of respective mutually adjacent links. The links together form, in this way, an endless belt, which is normally driven and guided by drive wheels and guide wheels or rollers. Each link has at one end part thereof a first part cylindrical surface 7b and at the other end part thereof a second part cylindrical surface 7d . The diameter of one part cylindrical surface shall coincide with the diameter of the other part cylindrical surface. The pivot centres of the links shall lie on the respective centres of the part cylindrical surfaces. A wear resistant insert can be placed between the one end part of one link and the end part of an adjacent link. Arranged on the mutually opposite sides of the links is one or two mutually parallel side walls 8 having two holes 8a, 8b for cooperation with a respective link.
