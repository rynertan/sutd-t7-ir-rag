# Method for forming decorative colored streak patterns on the surface of an aluminum shaped article.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel and improved method according to wich the surface of a shaped article of aluminum or an aluminum based alloy is provided with decorative streak patterns electrolytically engraved in the surface which can be subsequently colored to in crease the decorative effect with uniform distribution over whole surface of the aluminum article. The method comprises first subjecting the anodically oxidized alu minum article to an anodic direct current electrolysis in an electrolytic solution containing a specified electro lyte and then carrying out a cathodic direct current electrolysis with the aluminum article and the counter electrode kept as before in the same electrolytic solu tion as used in the first anodic direct current electrolysis with reversed polarity to give uniformly distributed streak patterns on the surface of the aluminum article. The surface of the aluminum article thus provided with the streak patterns is subsequently anodized to enhance the corrosion resistance and then subjected to a coloring treatment.
