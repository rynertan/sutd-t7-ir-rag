# Endoscopes of the type provided with a sampling device.

## Abstract
An endoscope with a sampling device which can positively and quickly take samples of deposits on the inner wall of a pipe or the like or of cells on the inner wall of a body cavity when inserted through a forceps channel 22 in the endoscope 11 . For taking samples purely by a suction action within a pipe, or in a living body, samples cannot be easily obtained in some cases, as positivity force is lacking, and if it is necessary to sample a powder, simultaneous scraping and sucking actions are required to obtain the powder sample. Therefore, in an endoscope constructed in accordance with the present invention the sampling device is a hollow suction tube 22 which can be inserted through a channel 20 in the endoscope 11 , and a scraping means 26 formed near an opening 27 at the tip of the suction tube 22 , the tube 22 being connected at the rear hand grip to a suction means 24 to suck samples that are scraped off by the scraping means 26 so as to positively extract the samples.
