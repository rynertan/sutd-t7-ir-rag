## Description
A DEVICE FOR FIXATION OF CATHETERS AND THE LIKETechnical fieldThe present invention refers to a device for fixation of catheters, drainage tubes, tubes or the like to the skin and comprising holding means for the catheter or the like or for a connection member for it and at least one pointed fixing member connected or connectable to said holding means and intended to penetrate the skin for fixing the device.Background of the inventionCatheters are usually relatively small, resilient and flexible tubes made of natural or synthetic rubber or of various polymers and they extend from outside a patient s body into and through his tissues and cavity organs for the purpose of introducing medicines, nutritive solutions, contrast liquids etc., for taking samples and for several other purposes.The success of catheterization and often the life of the patient is determined to a large degree of a proper placement and fixation of the catheter in a correct position. Accidental dislodgement of the catheter is frequently encountered in children, disoriented or combative adults and in patients who might frequently be turned about in bed or moved to different departments or the hospital. The problem becomes even more important for patients, who need catheters for the whole their life course, such those with intestinal insufficiency and parenteral nutrition at home.If the fixation of the catheter is insatisfactory it may be inserted further into the patients body, partially or entirely withdrawn or perform to and fro movements. For example in the case of central venous catheters the frequency of inadvertant catheter dislodgement is about 257.. Among the complications caused by catheter displacement can be mentioned injuries on the catheterized and neighboring organs. which in some cases can be so serious that the patient dies cronic irritation of the organ walls, which for central venous catheters may result in thrombosis or fatal subacute endocarditis the catheter kinks or twists at which its function is stopped or detoriated possible readings of intracavitary pressures become false skin irritations and risk for infections through the catheter insertion site.Among the most common methods which today are used for fixation of the catheter to the skin can be mentioned Fixation by adhesive tapes. which however in many cases gives an unsatisfactory fixation. Sweating and possible growth of hair causes the tape to pull of at which the catheter can slip out.2. Skin sutures, which today is the safest method of catheter fixation. The disadvantages with this method is however that it can cause inflammations and scare formation. Besides it is less adaquate for soft catheters and for long term use more than a month , when the sutures become loose and are gradually rejected by the patients organism 3. Surgical methods, which however are complicated and time consuming and have to be performed by specialists.In the US patent specification 4.164.943 Is disclosed a device for catheter fixation, which comprises a disc with a number of needles. which wher the disc is rotated penetrates the skin and is fixed thereto. Holding means for the catheter is arranged on the disc. This device does however not provide a safe fixation, as the needles easily are displaced out of their position at sudden movements. Besides it is difficult to choose and to observe the position for the introduction of needles.Purpose and most important features of the inventionThe purpose of the present invention is to provide a device of the kind mentioned in the introduction, which provides a simple, quick and very safe fixation of the catheter. It should further permit a fixation during a theoretically unlimited duration of time without the need to be changed. A condition for this is that irritation and infection are avoided, which demands a very strong fixation. This has according to the invention in achieved by the fact that the fixing means during the application of the device is movable with respect to the holding means and lockable with respect to this in the applied position. Descriotion of the drawingsThe invention will now be further described with reference to some embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 shows in perspective and on an enlarged scale a first embodiment of the invention.Fig. 2 shows a somewhat modified embodiment of the device according to fig. 1.Fig. 3 shows in a front view another embodiment of the device in the applied position.Fig. 4 shows a device according to fig. 3 in the applied posi tion. Fig. 5a shows schematically a further embodiment of the device according to the invention fixed to example an arm of a patient.Fig. 5b shows in a small view a device according to figure 5a.Fig. 5c is a vertical section through the device.Fig. 6a d show a further embodiment of the device, at whichFig. 6a shows a vertical section through the device,Fig. 6d and 6 c show in perspective the upper and lower plate resp. of the device.Fig. 6d shows the device applied to the skin of the patient.Fig. 7a and 7b show a pair of special designs of the fixation needles of the device,Fig. 8a b show another embodiment of the invention especially designed for fixation of the connection member of a catheter, at whichFig. Ea shows the device in perspective. Fig. 8b shows a vertical section through the device fixed to the skin of the patient,Fig 9 shows a modified embodiment of the device according to fig. 8. Descriotion of the embodimentsIn its most simple embodiment the device according to the invention consists of a surgical clip 10 fig.1 , which may be made of a maleable metal, e g. silver. which is non irritating for the tissues. The clip 10 is designed with a canal 12 intended to receive a catheter 11, in which canal the catheter is retained in clamped position. This type of fixation device can be suitable for catheters having a small outer diameter 1 3 mm and for only short duration of catheterization about 7 10 days . The insertion is made in the following manner The catheter is passed between the jaws 13 of the clip and into the channel 12. A skin fold is made by help of one or two surgical pincers, whereupon the jaws 13 of the clip are placed at a base of the skin fold. The jaws of the clip are closed by means of an anathomical pincers or by a pair of pincers especially constructed and used for insertion and withdrawal of usual surgical clips. During this last step the channel 12 is closed, whereby the catheter 11 is locked therein at the same time as the clip is attached to the skin. The withdrawal of the clip is brought about in the same manner as for usual surgical clips. In figure 2 is shown a modified embodiment of the clip according to figure 1 whereby this above the jaws 13 is provided with a channel 14, which is formed by a slotted cylinder 15 made e.g. from thin elastic steel. Two rectangular plates 16 are arranged to continue at the edges of the slot.and these plates between them delimit a space 17. The upper edges of the plates 16 are made thicker and they have recesses 18 for application of a surgical pincers. The channel 14 which is delimited by the cylinder 15 has a diameter which is somewhat less than the outer diameter of the catheter which shall be locked therein. The inner side of the cylinder can be rough or coated by a thin layer of a polymer having a high coefficient of friction e.g. polyuretane in order to prevent the catheter from sliding to and fro in the channel 14.The insertion is made in the following manner. The plates 16 are pulled apart by means of a small surgical pincers see e.g. fig. 3 and the catheter is placed in the cylinder 15.The pincers is removed and the slotted cylinder formed the channel 14 when the plates 16 moves back to their initial positions, which is brought about by the elasticity by the cylinder itself. The insertion thereabove takes place in the same manner as for the first mentioned clip.The advantages with the clip according to fig. 2 compared to that according to fig. 1 is that the risk for damages to the catheter from the jaws of the clip is eliminated.In figs. 3 and 4 is shown a device ressembling a crab pincers and which also is based on the principal for surgical clips.The device can be designed with one or two pincers. The pincers 19 is preferably made from a stainless steel medical grades. Immediately above the pivot axis 20 of the pincers between the arms and rigidly connected to these is arranged a resilient cylinder 28, which is slotted at its upper side. The inner side of the cylinder can be rough or coated with a thin layer of an elastic polymer having a high friction coefficient e.g. polyuretane . The jaws of the pincers are fine curved surgical needles 23 of e.g. titanium, which is an inert material in medical connections.That insertion of the device the needles 23 penetrate into the skin of the patient and into the subcutaneous tissues. The penetration of the needles 23 is limited by small rounded proJections 25 which at the bottom form the end of the arms of the pincers. The channel which is formed by the cylinder 21 has an internal diamter which is somewhat smaller than the outer diamter of the catheter 11 which is to be fixed thereby.The device is inserted in the following manner. The arms of the pincers 19 are moved apart by means of a fine surgical pincers 22 fig. 3 , whereby the cylinder 21 is opened and the catheter 11 is placed therein. A skin fold 26 is made by means of two or several surgical pincers, whereupon the jaws of the pincers are located at the base of the skinfold. The surgical pincers 22 is removed with caution, whereupon the flexible cylinder 21 goes to its initial position and closes the cannel. At the same time the needles 23 penetrate the skin 27 and the subcutaneous tissues 28 of the patient. The penetration is limited by the projections 25.The device is removed in the corresponding manner by the arms of the pincers being pushed apart by means of a surgical pincers.The device is suited for all types of catheters and for almost unlimited duration of catheterizationThe device according to the embodiment shown in figs. 5a c consists of a curved plate 29 of a hard pals tic material or by stainless steal medical grade provided with two or four orifices 30 through which one or two needles preferably from non alloy titanium can be inserted. On top of the plate 29 is fitted a catheter holder 32 which is fixedly connected thereto. The catheter holder 32 is provided with a lock 33, which together form a cannel for the catheter 11.The device is inserted in the following manner. A skin fold is made by means of two surgical pincers. The curved plate 29 is applied on the fold between the surgical pincers, the needles 31 are inserted through the orifices 31 and the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the patient and are fixed by means of tips 34 which are screwed thereon firmly and insure a secure fixation of the entire device and prevent that the needles 31 slide to and fro in the tissue of the patient. The device is particularly intended for curved surfaces, e.g.on an arm 35 but when made in small dimensions it can be adapted to other positions for the catheterization. It is convenient for all duration of catheterization.The device shownn in figs. 6a d consists of two plates e.g. of stainless steel medical grade , an upper plate 36 and a lower plate 37 , which are interconnected by means of a pivot 38.The plates 36,37 are provided with grooves 39 and 40 respectively which are situated just in front of each other and which when the plates are in a position brought together form a cylindrical channel 59 for a catheter. A curved surgical needle 41 is pivotably connected to the lower plate 37 and the lower plate 37 has a trough passage 42 for the needle 41 and the upper plate 36 a recess arranged in front of said passage for receiving the tip of the needle. A member which delimites the movement of the needle may be arranged in the passage 42. e.g springy projections. At the entrance to said passage 42 there can also be arranged such projections 56, which possibly can be designed as a clamping member, which can be clamped about the needle 41 and prevent movement of this.One of the plate 37 has a press stud 44, which cooperates with a recess 45 in the other plate 36 for locking the two plates to each other.The device can be provided with one or two curved surgical needles 41, which should be made of titanium which is an inert material in medical connections. The needles can at there bases be connected to the pivot shaft which interconnects the two plates 36, 37. If however only one needle is used, such as shown in figs. 6a d this can be hingedly connected to the lower plate 37. The needle or the needles respectively can be perforated 46 such as shown in figs. 7a and b whereby it can be penetrated by fibres of connective tissue. A biological fixation of the needles in the tissue of the patient is thereby secured and movement of the needle and transport of bacteria from the skin and into the tunnel form by the needle are avoided. The tip of the needle may be conventional, whereby in order to bring about a safe fixation the recess 43 should be filled with a material having a high friction coefficient and sufficiently soft to permit penetration by the needle e.g.rubber or polyuretane . The tip of the needle can have the shape of an arrow tip, which gives a very secure fixtion but which causes problem at the removal of the needle. It can be shaped as a javelin tip, whereby the above problem is reduced.It can furthermore be threaded, such as shown e.g. in fig 8b and it can be fixed by means of a protected cap provided with internal threads. Other fixation devices are thereby execessive. It can further be provided with small barbs, which engage with in recesses e.g. in a protective cap.In fig. 7b is shown two needles 41 mounted on a common shaft 47 on which also the plates 36.37 can be mounted. The shaft 47 can be prolonged by a handle 48. which allows insertion of the needles without aid of particular equipment e.g. Hagerdon s needle driver . This is variable particularly in emergency situation when such special equipment is not available. The device according to figs. 6a d is inserted in the following manner.A skin fold is made by means of two surgical pincers. The needle 41 or the needles are inserted at the base of the skin fold by aids of a Hagerdon s needle driver or by means of the handle 48 if the device is provided with such a handle. The upper plate 36 can thereupon be moved upwards and the catheter is located in the recess 40 of the lower plate 37. The surgical pincers can now be removed and the upper plate 36 can be moved down and fixation take place by means of the press stud 44 or by means of a threaded protective cap if the needle tip is threaded.The device shown in figs. 8a b consists of a single plate 49 of a hard plastic material e.g. polystyrene or Teflon or by stainless steel. The plate 49 is provided with a shaft 5Q for carrying two curved surgical needles 41.The tips of the needles are threaded and are moved upwards through the passages in the plate 49, where they are fixed by means of a couple of protective caps 53. These are preferably provided with a handle 54 for making the turning easier. The projection 55 on the needle 41 near its base delimits the penetration of the needle into the tissues. The projections 56 shown at the entrance to the needle passages of the plate 49 are intended to stabilize the device. They can possibly be designed as clamping members, which can be clamped about the needles 41 for fixing these securely.The plate at its upper side has a fixing device formed as a dovetailed groove 51 in which can be inserted and fixed a connection member 52 for a catheter. The fixation of the connection member 52 to the groove 51 can also be made via a connection piece not shown which is designed for different sizes of the connection members intended for different catheter sizes.The insertion technique is similar to that for the device according to figures 6a d. After the plate 49 has been fixed the connection member 52 is inserted into the groove 51 and its wings 57 are retained only by friction from the walls of the groove. The foremost and rearmost ends of the connection member 52 are situated outside the edges of the plate 49 and allow connection of infusion, or drainage systems and for manipulation of the catheter. The device shown in figure 9 is also intended for fixation of the connection member 52 of the catheter. The device incorporates aEMI9.1 plate 29 which is fitted to the skin by means of two needles 31 in a manner corresponding to that of the device according to figures 5a c. The tips of the needles 31 can be threaded and be fixed by means of a couple of screw caps 34. The plate 29 is at its upper side provided with a device forming a dovetailed groove 51 in order to receive a connection member 52 of a catheter.The needles 31 can be connected to a shaft 57 extending between them in order to facilitate their insertion The invention is of course not limited to the embodiments shown but can be varied within the scope of the claims. In the text has only been described catheters, but it is to be understood that the device also is suitable for fixation of drainage tubes, probes and tubes of different types.
