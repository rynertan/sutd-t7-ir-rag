## Description
MATERIAL FOR RESOLUTION OF OPTICAL ISOMERS, ITSPREPARATION AND USE.Background of the InventionThis invention relates to a novel material capable of optically resolving with good efficiency a mixture of optically active compounds, and which for example can be used to resolve a racemic mixture.Prior ArtIn the prior art, a main chromatographic procedure for optical resolution of racemic mixtures involves ligand exchange chromatography. This method compris.es paEkitng a column with a filler having a chiral amino acid bonded to a synthetic resin. The filled column is then saturated with metallic ions and a mixture of optically active compounds to be resolved is passed as a solution through the column. Separation occurs into the respective optic ally active compounds. This method is based in princip,,l,e on the difference 4n coordinating forces of the optically active isomers to the metallic ions in the resin.With this prior art method, howevet , there are drawbacks, in that the applicable samples are restricted to compounds having groups capable of acting as ligands, such as amines, amino acids or carboxylic acids. Moreover, the complexes formed in the synthetic resin layer are labile and elimination reactions may occur. It is also to be noted that only water soluble samples may be used and that in practice both samples and eluents have to be aqueous electrolyte solutions.Another resolution procedure uses an inert optically active metal complex ion adsorbed onto a cation exchange resin. However, in this method, the bonding between the metal complex ion and the ion exchange resin is a mere physical adsorption. Therefore, elimination of the complex ion from the resin can readily occur with various eluents. Accordingly, there are restrictions on the possible compounds which can be resolved, and again the method is applicable only to water soluble samples both the samples and the eluents have to be aqueous electrolyte solutions.Objects of the Present InventionOne object of this invention is to provide a material foE r olution of optical isomers. Such a material should be applicable for samples of electrolytes as well as for samples of non electrolytes. Thus, a further object of this invention is to provide a resolution in erial which can be used in either an aqueous solvent or a non aqueous solvent such as an organic solvent.A related object of this invention is to devise a synthesis for new resolution materials, while an additional object is to put forward a method of resolving optical isomers which method can be used efficiently with many kinds of optically active compound.Summary of the InventionIt has been found that an optically active complex covalently bonded to silicon dioxide can afford a material suited for resolution of optical isomers. More specifically, the material comprises macromolecular silicon dioxide, for example silica gel, to which are chemically bonded molecules of a resolved optically active form of a cobalt III complex. Such a material can be prepared by modification of available syntheteic methods, and can give good resolution of optically active compounds, especially organic compounds.Description of Preferred EmbodimentsThe cobalt III complex molecules are covalently bonded to the macromolecular silicon dioxide, and are thus chemically secured in position. Such bonding can be achieved through bridging chains. Each bridging chain can extend to the macromolecular silicon dioxide from a ligand on the complex, and typically includes one or more carbon atoms and a silicon atom. The silicon atom of the bridging chain can then link the carbon atoms of the chain to the macromolecular silicon dioxide, usually through a silanol bond. The complex suitably has six amino nitrogen atoms coordinated thereto in order to impart optical activity, and it is a simple matter to arrange that the bridging chain extends from one of the six coordinating amino nitrogen atoms.Thus, in one aspect of this invention there is provided a material for optical resolution of a mixture of optical isomers of an optically active compound which material comprises chromatographic silicon dioxide and a resolved optically active cobalt III complex. The complex is an optically active hexamine type complex with six amino nitrogen atoms coordinated to a cobalt III centre. A carbon chain is attached to one of the six nitrogen atoms, and in this aspect of the invention the carbon chain connects the cobalt III complex to the silicon dioxide through a silanol type bond.For preference, the cobalt III complex of the resolution materials of this invention comprises an optically active cation which can be represented by the formula 1 iCo biN2 coordN4 l3 1 wherein biN2 represents a bidentate ligand, the bidentate ligand having two amino nitrogen atoms coordinated to the cobalt III atom and the bidentate ligand carrying on one of its nitrogen atoms the bridging chain not shown in the formula to the macromolecular silicon dioxide and coordN4 represents four amino nitrogen atoms coordinated to the cobalt III atom and forming part of two bidentate ligands or one tetradentate ligand.The molecular formula of the resolution materials of this invention is not certain, but they can be considered to be of the general formula 2 Si O Si A Co biN2 coordN4 .X wherein Si O Si represents a silicon dioxide macromolecule bonded through a silicon atom to the group A A represents a divalent hydrocarbyl group, preferably a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl group Co biN2 coordN4 is a resolved optically active cobalt III complex in which biN2 represents a bidentate ligand, the bidentate ligand having two amino nitrogen atoms coordinated to the cobalt III atom and the bidentate ligand carrying on one of its nitrogen atoms the group A and coordN4 represents four amino nitrogen atoms Icoordinated to the cobalt III atom and forming part of two bidentate ligands or one tetradentate ligan4 and X represents one or more anions anions satisfying the cationic charge of,3 . Any uncertainty in structure arises mainly from the nature of the macromolecular portion and the way it bonds to the bridging group A. Moreover the given formula does got explicitly show more than one cobalt III complex linked to the macromolecule. Nevertheless, the general formula 2 is of assistance in discussing the invention and will be used in the non limiting sense.A preferred group of compounds of this invention may then be exemplified by compounds having the general formula 2a Si O Si A Co biN2 coordN4 3 .X 2a or by the formula 2b Si O Si A Co biN2 coordN4 3 .X 2b wherein Si O Si , A, biN2, coordN4 and X are as defined above, and the greek symbols are used in the conventional manner to indicate the stereochemistry, as described for example in Inorganic Chemistry 9 1970 at page 1. Among the compounds of formula 2 according to this invention, a typical example has the following formula Si O Si CH2 3 Co en phen 2 .Cl3, which exists in two formsEMI7.1 In the compounds of this invention there iF a carbon chain included in the covalent bridge between the resolved cobalt complex and the silicon containing macromolecule. This carbon chain is usually a divalent hydrocarbyl group with a backbone of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and can have a saturated or unsaturated acyclic, cyclic or mixed acyclic cyclic chain. Suitable hydrocarbyl groups include, for example, alkylene groups, alkenylene groups, phenylene, 4,4 biphenylene or other arylene groups, and cyclohexylene or other cycloalkylene groups.Particularly preferred are straight chain lower alkylene groups of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethylene or trimethylene.The bidentate ligand biN2 in the prefered compounds of this invention preferably has 2 or 3 carbon atoms between the two amino nitrogen atoms, and is preferably an alkylenediamine, cycloalkylenediamine or arylenediamine group, for example an ethylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, 1,2 propanediamine, 1, 3 propanediamine, cyclohexanediamine, phenylenediamine, or the like group, though its nature is not critical. Ethylenediamine is particularly preferred.The substituent coordN4 can be two bidentate ligands, such as the bidentate ligands given above for the ligand biN2 and again preferably has 2 or 3 carbon atoms between the nitrogen atoms. The diamine bidentate ligands such as ethylenediamine, d and or 11,2 propanediamine are preferred, but there may also be mentioned piperidine, phenanthroline or other nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, and trans cyclohexanediamine as preferred examples. The substituent c,oordN4 can also be a tetradentate ligand, preferably with 2 or 3 carbon atoms between each nitrogen atom, and is then, for example, triethylenetetramine.The one or more anions X satisfying the cationic charge of 3 may include those anions employed conventionally in complex compounds preferred anions include a halogen ion such as bromide ion or chloride ion, a sulphate ion, and a chlorate ion.The resolution materials of this invention can be prepared by resolving an optically active cobalt III complex 3 having four coordinated amino nitrogen atoms and two coordinated labile atoms to give a resolved isomer the four amino nitrogen atoms forming part of two bidentate ligands or one tetradentate ligand, and the two labile atoms forming part of two monodentate labile ligands or one bidentate labile ligand, each labile ligand being capable of ligand exchange with a bifunctional group having two coordinatable nitrogen atoms and reacting the resolved isomer of the optically active cob,alt III complex in a solvent with a macromolecular silicon dioxide functionalized with an organic group having two nitrogen atoms capable of forming a bidentate ligand on the cobalt III complex. Preferred cobalt complexes of formula 3 for use as starting compounds in the reaction may be represented by the formula 4 CoL2coordN4 4 wherein L2 represents the ligands cooordinated through labile atoms, coordN4 is as defined above, and Y represents one or more anions satisfying the cationic charge of the complex.Examples of appropriate ligands L include diaqua, diacido, dinitrato, carbonato, and other replaceable ligands as are well known in the art. Y will usually be a sulphate ion, chlorate ion or a halogen ion such as a chloride or bromide ion.Thus, examples of preferred starting materials of formula 3 include the following compounds Co en chda 2 X3 Co en pn 2 X3 Co en bip 2 X3 cr or B 1Co en trien X3 wherein chda represents trans cyclohexanediamine, pn represents d or l l,2 propanediamine, bip represents bipyridine and trien represents triethylenetetramine. Resolution of the complex 3 can be achieved using conventional procedures reported in the literature and for instance involving diastereoisomer formation.The functionalized macromolecular silicon dioxide is preferably one represented by the notional formula 5 Si O Si A biN2 5 wherein Si O Si , A and biN2 are as defined above.Such a starting material can easily be prepared using available synthetic procedures, such as those des cribed in J. Chromatogr. 185 1979 361 for the compound referred to as wSi en . Thus, macromolecular silicon dioxide can be reacted with a siloxane compound which is preferably of the formula 7 Ro 3 Si A NH A NH2 7 wherein R is an alkyl group, usually a methyl orvethyl group, A is as defined above and A is a divalent hydrocarbyl group, usually with a backbone of 2 or 3 carbon atoms between the nitrogen atoms.The partstructure NH A NH2 corresponds with the group biN2 defined above which is preferably alkylenediamine, cycloalkylenediamine or arylenediamine group, especially an ethylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, 1,2 propanediamine, 1,3 propanediamine, cyclohexanediamine or phenylenediamine. Examples of suitable solvents for the reaction between the compound 3 and the compound 5 include polar non proton solvents, particularly the substituted acid amide solvents such as dimethylformamide. The reaction temperature and the time required for the reaction may vary depending primarily on the particular nature of the starting compounds employed. It is preferred to carry out the reaction at a relatively low temperature, for example, at room temperature or below, even down to the freezing point of the solvent or lower still, in order to suppress the racemization reaction. The time required for the reaction is normally one to several or many days. In this reaction it seems the silicon atom in the compound 7 becomes a silanol group bonding the group A to the macromolecule, thus giving the partstructure M O Si A where M is the macromolecule and A is as defined . After completion of the reaction, the desired compound may be isolated using conventional procedure such as filtration under reduced pressure and purified similarly.The resolution materials of this invention can be used for optical resolution of a mixture of optical isomers of an optically active compound by contacting the mixture with the resolution material and sequentially separating the isomers from the material. Optical resolution with the present resolution materials can be carried out by using conventional procedures such as column chromatography. A convenient resolution technique involves packing a column with the material of this inven tion, charging the column with a solution of the substance to be resolved, and eluting with a suitable eluent. In particular, high speed liquid chromatography equipment can readily be employed for the resolution method of this invention.The use of a material similar to those of the present invention in a chromatographic system is described inJ Chromatogr 185 1979 361. However, in this previous article the material is employed for separating nucleotides and nucleosides from each other. To thisend, the cobalt complex was employed in its racemic form, with no suggestion of using an optically resolved form. The known material is employed chromatographically to separate different compounds from each other.The method according to this invention is one of optical resolution and is widely applicable to various natural products, synthetic compounds, and other substances.For example, it can be effectively applied to organic compounds such as amino acids, carboxylic acids, nucleic acids, steroids, and perfumes. Furthermore, the typical optical resolution material according to this invention is relatively inert. Since part of one of the ligands on the optically active cobalt centre is chemically bonded to the silicon dioxide, little if any racemization or decomposition occurs in the complex itself. Additionally, because the resolution involves hydrogen bonding or pi pi interaction between the complex and the compound being resolved, few restraints are placed on the compounds which can be resolved. The resolution material of this invention can thus be used on a wide range of samples substantially without restriction on the aqueous or non aqueous properties of the permitted eluents or the hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties of the resolvable compounds.Description of the DrawingsFigure 1 is the circular dichroism CD spectrum of the resolution material prepared in Example 1, a compound termed Si O Si CH Co en phen C13, andFigure 2 is a high speed liquid chromatogram for the optical resolution of DL mandelic acid using the resolution material of Example 2 Examples of the InventionThis invention is further illustrated in the following non limiting Examples.EXAMPLE 1.
