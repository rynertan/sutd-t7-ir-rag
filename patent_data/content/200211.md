## Description
DIAGNOSTIC RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS This invention was made with Government support under GrantNumber 1 ROl NS18509 awarded by the Department of Health andHuman Services. The Government has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to new diene compounds, new ligands, new technetium 99m radiopharmaceutical compounds which are derived therefrom, and to a method and kit for selectively depositing, for diagnostic purposes, technetium 49m containing radiopharmaceutical compounds in target tissues or organs of a mammal. Mammal as used herein includes the human being. The invention more particularly relates to new diene compounds which are intermediate in the production of new ligands, which have utility as chelating agents, and technetium99m containing radiopharmaceutical compounds which are capable of selective accumulation in tissues or organs having lowered intracellular pH as a result of normal metabolism or diseased state.B Description of the Prior Art Radiopharmaceutical compounds have been in use for diagnostic purposes for a long time. Those well versed in the art relating to radiopharmaceuticals and nuclear medicine are well aware of the requirements which must be satisfied by a diagnostically useful radiopharmaceutical compound. Briefly, these requirements include the following. The radiopharamaceutical compound must be able to penetrate into a target tissue or organ and attain a sufficiently high concentration therein so that its presence is detectable by state of the art radiation monitoring means. The accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical compound in the target tissue or organ must be sufficiently selective relative to other tissues and organs of the body so that a diagnostic distinction for its presence in the target tissue or organ relative to the other tissues or organs can be made.Furthermore, the radiopharmaceutical compound must emit radiation capable of penetrating through several other tissues or organs of the body. Experience has shown that only radiopharmaceutical compounds emitting gamma, X ray or positron radiation satisfy this requirement. Finally, and preferably, a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical compound should be easily prepared from inexpensive and available radionuclides. U.S. Patents 4,363,793 and 4,474,746 describe in detail the various prior art means to attain tissue and or organ penetration and uptake by a radiopharmaceutical compound by exploiting various differences in metabolic or physiological states of the several tissues of the body, including methods which take advantage of lipid solubility and regional pH differences with an organ which allows selective radioisotope deposition utilizing regional pE shift. For further information on these phenomena, see an article by Michael D. Loberg et al, entitled MembraneTransport of T 99m Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals Initial BrainUptake by Passive Transport , J. Nucl. Med. Vol. 20 No. 11, pp.1181 1188 and an article by W. J. Waddell and R. G. Bates titled Intracellular pH, Physiological Review 49 pp. 286 329, 1969. The method disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,363,793 and 4,474,746 exploiting required pH shift to target radiopharmaceutical compounds has proven to be a valuable diagnostic tool but the compounds identified by the patents for attaining such method have not been as effective as desired. Thus, a need exists for new radiopharmaceutical compounds which exhibit a full complement of desirable characteristics, particularly for single photon emission tomography, such as high initial brain uptake, fixed regional distribution, long brain retention, and a high brain blood ratio.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, new diene compounds have been provided which can be readily reduced to form new ligand compounds which have broad utility as metal chelating agents and which when combined with technetium 99m isotope form new technetium 99m containing diagnostic radiopharmaceutical compounds which are capable of entering a target tissue or a target organ by passive diffusion through cell walls and which are effectively accumulated and retained within the target tissue or organ due to a regional pH shift. Such compounds can be readily produced by a method of the invention and have displayed a full compliment of metal chelating and diagnostically desirable characteristics. More specifically, the new diene compounds of the invention are of the formula EMI4.1 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4 R5 R6, 7, and R8, is independently selected from st least one of hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclic alkyl1 aryl, carboxylic acid ester, and carboxylic acid amide each M is selected from hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkene, acyl alkyl, acyl aryl, alkoxy alkyl, alkoxy aryl, acyl alkoxy, acyl aryloxy, silyl trialkyl, alkyl aryl and the like or M represents a covalent bond between the two sulfur atoms of the structure provided at least one ofR1, R2, R3, R4, R5 R6, R7, and R8 contains at least one nitrogen atom. The ligand compounds of the invention are of the formula EMI5.1 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4 R5, R6, 7 and R8, is independently selected from at least one of hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclic alkyl, aryl, carboxylic acid ester, and carboxylic acid amide each M is selected from hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkene, acyl alkyl, acyl aryl, alkoxy alkyl, alkoxy aryl, acyl alkoxy, acyl aryloxy, silyl trialkyl, alkylaryl and the like, or M represents a covalent bond between the two sulfur atoms of the structure provided at leas t one of R1 , R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 contains at least one nitrogen atom. The radiopharmaceutical compounds of the invention are of the formula EMI5.2 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R71 and RB, is independently selected from at least one of hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl1 alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclic alkyl, aryl, carboxylic acid ester, and carboxylic acid amide provided at least one of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 contains at least one nitrogen atom. The technetium 99m radioactive element of the structure is an element which emits gamma ray gamma ray at a half life of about 6 hours and gamma energy of about 140 kiloelectron volts KeV which is detectable in a target organ or tissue having a significantly different and usually lower intracellular pH than the blood of the mammal. The lipophilicity is sufficiently low at a pH of 6.6 or lower and usually at 7.0 or lower to prevent rapid return of the compound from the target organ or tissue to the blood. The compounds of the pharmaceutical method further will have no overall net positive charge at pH 12 and no net overall negative charge at pH 6.0. The compounds desirably have an octanol aqueous medium partition coefficient which is significantly dependent on the pH of the aqueous medium at least in the pH range of 6.60 to 7.60. In a method of the invention, the compounds are introduced into the blood circulation of a mammal, which as previously mentioned includes human beings, wherein they are in a relatively lipid soluble state. The compounds readily penetrate several tissues and organs of the body by passive diffusion. In target tissues or organs of the body wherein the intracellular pH is significantly lower than the pH of the bloodstream, the compounds assume a more hydrophilic, less lipid soluble state whereby the rate of egress of the compounds from the cells by diffusion is significantly diminished. As a result, the compounds are at least temporaril trapped within the target tissue or organ and may be detected therein by the radiation monitoring means.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is an autoradiogram of rat brain distribution of radioactivity two 2 minutes after intravenous injection with a radioactive compound of the prior art. Figure 2 is an autoradiogram of rat brain distribution of radioactivity fifteen 15 minutes after intravenous injection with a radioactive compound of the prior art. Figure 3 is an autoradiogram of rat brain distribution of radioactivity two 2 minutes after intravenous injection with a radioactive compound of the invention. Figure 4 is an autoradiogram of rat brain distribution of radioactivity fifteen 15 minutes after intravenous injection with a radioactive compound of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, radiopharmaceutical compounds of the formula EMI7.1 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 as previously described can be prepared by a novel radiosynthetic process, wherein an appropriate, dithio substituted or unsubstituted dialkyl aldehyde is reacted with an appropriate substituted or unsubstituted alkyl vicinal diamine to form the 1,2 dithio 5,8diazacyclodeca 4,8 diene 3,3 ,6,6 ,7,7 ,10,10 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl amide and or amine in accord with the following EMI8.1 Wherein R1 R8 are as before described.The 1,2 dithio 5,8 diazacyclodeca 4,8 diene 3,3 ,6,6 ,7,7 ,1O,1O substituted or unsubstituted alkyl amide and or amine is readily reduced to form the 1,2 dithio 5,8 diazacyclodeca 3,6,7,10 substituted or unsubstituted amine EMI9.1 Labeling of the 1,2 dithio 5,8 diazocyclodeca 3,3 ,6,6 ,7,7 ,10,10 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl amine is achieved by reducing technetium pertechnetate, preferably with either sodium borohydride or stannous pyrophosphate in ethanol or saline, in the presence of the compound.The disulfide bond of the 1 ,2 dithio 5,8 diazacyclodeca substituted or unsubstituted dialkyl amine is reduced along with the pertechnetate to produce the desired technetium complex in accordance with the following EMI9.2 In certain instances it may be desirable to reduce the disulfide bond prior to treatment with an appropriate technetium 99m source. Generally, the i , o dithio substituted or unsubstituted dialkyl aldehydes utilized as a starting material for the aforesaid method of preparation can be prepared by various means known in the prior art. One such method for manufacturing the symmetrical dialdehyde comprises, reaction of an appropriate substituted or unsubstituted aldehyde with S2Cl2 sulfuryl chloride in accord with the following reaction scheme EMI10.1 wherein R5 R8 are as previously described. In instances wherein R5 R8 contain aryl or other easily chlorinated reactive groups, it may be necessary to follow an alternative synthetic sequence to avoid chlorination of the substituent.Such method, as described, can also be utilized to form the unsymmetrical aldehyde, however, the multiple variable products which result require sophisticated separation techniques. We have found that alternately, the asymmetric substituted compounds of the invention can be easily produced by one of skill in the art by sequentially linking each of the vicinal nitrogen of an appropriate substituted or unsubstituted diamine with an appropriately S substituted thioglycolic acid in accord with the following, where X is a leaving group such as halogen and substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy, n oxyimide and the like, R1 R8 are as previously described and M is substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkene, acyl alkyl, acyl aryl, alkoxy alkyl, alkoxy aryl, acyl alkoxy, acyl aryloxy, silyl trialkyl, alkyl aryl and the like EMI11.1 EMI12.1 or other deblocking procedureEMI12.2 The alkyl, alkene, acyl alkyl, acyl aryl, alkoxy alkyl, alkoxy aryl, acyl alkoxy, acyl aryloxy, silyl trialkyl, alkyl aryl substituents of M act to block the sulfur atom from reactivity and are replaced with hydrogen to provide the active ligand chelating agent which can then form the radiopharmaceutical compounds of the invention. The resulting ligand can be easily labelled with an appropriate technetium 99m isotope by treatment with reactant technetium pertechnetate. Technetium as used herein is intended to mean the technetium 99m isotope. Appropriately S substituted thioglycolic acids such as used in the aforesaid reaction scheme are commercially available or can be easily prepared by prior art means such as by sequential alkylation using an appropriate substituted or unsubstituted alkyl halide. For further information on the manufacture of various S substituted thioglycolic acids see J. Amer. Chem. Soc.15, 201 1963 Chem. Pharm. Bulletin 26, 1576 978 OrganicSynthesis Collective, Vol. IV, p. 291 J. Med. Chem. 6, 136 1963 . Generally, the substitutd or unsubstituted vicinal diamines used as a reactant to form the organic compounds of the invention are commercially available. Various means are known in the prior art for the manufacture of these compounds wherein at least one of R1 R4 is other than hydrogen, one such method comprising derivation through an appropriate carboxylate substituted ethylene diamine of the formula EMI13.1 wherein Z is carboxylate or hydrogen and at least one Z is carboxylate. Typically, to block undesired reactivity at the amine sites, the diamine is first protected with a reagent such as di tert butyldicarbonate acid to form a 2,3 bis tbutoxycarbamoyl propanoate. The carboxylate radical of the blocked diamine can be easily hydrolized with a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, to produce the protected propanoic acid which can thereafter be reacted with an appropriate hydroxy R1 R4 group to position the appropriate substituent.

The reducing agent can be any compound that will reduce the technetium isotope. Preferably, the reducing agent is stannous chloride or similar FDA approved agent. The lyophilized pharmaceutical composition is typically supplied to the nuclear medicine facility which then adds the technetium 99m isotope to form the pharmaceutical compounds of the invention. The preferred chemical form of the isotope is technetium 99m pertechnetate. The target tissues or organs of the body, in accordance with the present invention, are tissues or organs which show a regional pH shift relative to surrounding tissues, organs or the bloodstream. As it was briefly discussed above, medical science has established that such regional pH shifts exist in the brain as well as in certain tumors and in ischemic heart tissue. Such pH shifts may also occur in various forms of abscesses. Since tumors may be entirely surrounded by healthy tissue of an organ, regional pH shifts may exist between healthy and malignant tissues of the same organ. The diagnostic significance of preferential accumulation of a radiopharmaceutical compound in a selected target organ or within the abnormal tissue of an organ is readily apparent to those skilled in the medical arts, and need not be further elaborated here. Monitoring or observing the selective accumulation of radiopharmaceutical compounds in the target tissues or organs may be readily accomplished by currently available radioactive imaging or scanning techniques and instruments. The amount of radioactive labeled compound or radiopharmaceuticl absorbed within the selected target tissue or organ may be expressed in terms of percentage of a total dose of the radiopharmaceutical compound which is injected into the animal. Radiopharmaceutical compounds which may be used in the novel diagnostic method of the present invention must satisfy the following requirements. They must possess lipid solubility characteristics significantly dependent on pH in at least the 6.6 to 7.6 pH range and desirably in the 7.0 to 7.4 pH range. Since the regional pH shift in all of the presently known target organs or tissues is toward a pH lower than the normal pH of the blood approximately 7.4 , the compounds of the present invention must show increasing lipid solubility and therefore increasing cell wall penetrating capability with increasing pH, at least in the 6.60 to 7.60 pE range.In addition, the compounds of the present invention must also emit gamma, X ray or positron radiation which can penetrate through surrounding organs and tissues of the body for ultimate detection by suitable monitoring instruments. Most such desirable compounds emit gamma or positron radiation. It is an important aspect of the present invention that the herein described radiopharmaceutical compounds penetrate through the cell walls by passive diffusion rather than being dependent on a specialized active or facilitated transport mechanism. The advantage of the ability to penetrate into the cells by diffusion is that the selective accumulation of a radiopharmaceutical compound of the present invention is principally dependent on the intracellular pH of the target, rather than on close structural similarity to a metabolite for which an active or facilitated transport mechanism exists. As is well known in the biochemical and related arts, the requirement for structural similarity between an analog and a metabolite are very exacting for the analog to be actively transported into the cells.Thus, compounds of the present invention may be of a wide variety of chemical structures the principal limiting requirement being the presence of the requisite lipid solubility pH dependence characteristics.After having penetrated the target having a regional pH shift, the compound is effectively trapped in the cells of the target because it is less lipid soluble at the pH of the target than at the pH of the blood. Consequently, the rate of egress of the compound by passive diffusion from the target is significantly slower than its rate of entry, i.e., the rapid return of the compound to the blood is prevented, which results in accumulation of the compound in the target, e.g., the egress or return rate may be from 2 to more than 100 times slower than the entry rate and is thus relatively less rapid than the entry rate.To prevent rapid return as used throughout the specification and claims is relative and means that the relative rate of return to the blood from the organ or tissue is slower than the entry into the organ or tissue from the blood as previously discussed. It has been found that conventional n octanol aqueous medium provide exellent indicia to determine the sufficient lipophilicity of a radiopharmaceutical compound at pH 7.6 to permit passage of the compound from the blood into the target organ or tissue and the insufficient lipophilicity to prevent rapid return of the compound from the target organ or tissue to the blood at pH 6.6. The n octanol aqueous medium partition coefficients of the compound are readily measured in accordance with standard practice in the prior art. Briefly, such measurements include the steps of dissolving a known amount of the compound in an aqueous buffer of a predetermined pH and extracting the buffet solution with 8 known amount of n octanol until an equilibrium of distribution of the compound between the aqueous and n octanol phases occurs.The concentration of the compound in both phases is then measured by suitable analytical means, such as ultraviolet spectrophotometry the partition coefficient being the ratio of the two measured concentrations. For the purposes of evaluating a plurality of radioactive compounds for use in the novel method of the present invention, the n octanol aqueous medium partition coefficients of the compounds were measured in the following manner. The radioactive compound was mixed with 1.0 ml of n octanol and 1.0 ml of buffer of the desired predet rrmined pll. The radioactivity of this mixture was counted, and the mixture was placed in a water bath shaker at 370C for 2 hours. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the n octanol layer was separated and its radioactivity counted.The partition coefficient of the compound was calculated by the following equation counts in n octanol Partition Coefficient initial counts counts in n octanol Equation 1 Partition coefficients obtained in this manner for a plurality of radiopharmaceutical compounds of the present invention, are shown in Table I. It has been found that compounds which are suitable for use in the novel diagnostic method of the present invention have noctanol aqueous medium partition coefficients hereinafter referred to simply as partition coefficients which increase by at least 20 as the pH increases from 6.60 to 7.60. Preferably the partition coefficient of the compound increases by at least 50 in the pH range from 6.60 to 7.60. The preferred partition coefficient at pH 7.6 for a particular compound is often between 0.5 and 500. The isotope in general is usually chemically bound to the compound by means of one or more covalent bonds. As used herein, Covalent includes the semicovalent bonds formed by chelate structures. Chemical compound as used herein, when referring to the compound of the invention, includes the entire compound including the radioactive isotope and all attached radicals and moieties. In general, the compound has no overall net positive charge at pH 12 and no net overall negative charge at pH 6.0. It is recognized that charge or ionization cannot always be entirely eliminated and when it is stated that the compound has no charge it is intended that less than one tenth of one numerical percent 0.1 of the compound is in a charged form. It is readily understood that as the pH of the medium increases, the compounds of the present invention, having a weakly basic moiety are gradually deprotonated and therefore assume a nonionized lipid soluble form which is usually due to the presence of lipophilic groups such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl, or arylcycloalkyl groups. Lowering the pH of the medium, on the other hand, results in increasing protonation of the weakly basic group resulting in increasing hydrophilicity of the compounds. These changes are reflected by the measured partition coefficients and by behavior of the compounds in the biological systems which are described below as an integral part of the description of the present invention. The ligand compounds of the invention, in addition to being intermediates to the formation of the radiopharmaceutical compounds of the invention, have a general utility as trace metal chelating agents. Thus, it is contemplated within the invention that the ligands are useful in chelating metals from metal processing solutions by the simple addition to such soluiton. The following representative examples are provided to show preparation of the compounds of the invention and their radiopharmaceutical utilities.Example IPreparation of N 2,3 Bis t butoxycarbamoyl propanoyloxy succinimide To a stirring suspension of 45 grams of ethyl 2,3 diaminopropanoate dihydrochloride in 300 ml of chloroform was sequentially added a solution of 36.88 grams of NaHC03 in 210 ml of H20, 87.7 grams of NaCl and 95.7 grams of di t butyl dicarbonate.

Sample A is a prior art 10,10,13,13 tetramethyl 11 ,12 dithia 8,15 diaza spiro 5.9 pentadecane technetium 99m complex. Partition coefficients were measured by mixing the compound with 3 g each of 1 octanol and phosphate buffer pH 7.0 or 7.4 in a test tube. The tube was vortexed 3 minutes at room temperature and then centrifuged for 5 min. Two weighted samples 0.59 each from the 1 octanol and buffer layers were counted in a well counter.

At different time periods 2 min. and 15 min. after the injection, the animals were sacrificed and the brain was excised, weighed and radiation counted in a dualchannel automatic gamma counter. The brain dose was estimated by comparison of tissue counts to suitably diluted amounts of the injected material. The brain to blood concentration ratios were calculated for the dose gram of wet tissue and the results for samples A L are tabulated in Table II.Example XVII Autoradiogram Comparison Autoradiograms were made of Sprague Dawley male rat brains of animals that were intravenously injected with 6 1N,N diethylamino methyl 3,3,10,10 tetramethyl 1,2 dithia 5,8diazacylcodecane technetium 99m complex of the invention and 10,10,13,13 tetramethyl 11,12 dithia 8,15 diazaspiro 5.9 penta decane technetium 99m complex of the prior art.
