# Process for the preparation of glycol derivatives.

## Abstract
Glycol ether esters can be prepared by reaction of an epoxide with an ester of a carboxylic acid using an amidine catalyst. The reaction can be used, for example, to prepare methoxypropyl acetate from propylene oxide and methyl acetate. By carrying the reaction out in the presence of an alcohol solvent the corresponding glycol ether is also formed.
