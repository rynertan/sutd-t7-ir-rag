# Method of printing magnetic images and magnetic recording apparatus.

## Abstract
Coincident current windings on a magnetic print head are driven in a special sequence to minimize undesired spurious printing effects otherwise caused by undesirable concentrations of magnetic flux. Rather than energizing all digit windings in accordance with supplied data values for each successive energization of a word winding, the digit windings are driven in multiple sub sets or groups. Only one such sub set is energized at any given time and the members of each sub set are chosen to minimize un desired spurious magnetic flux distributions for any given magnetic printing head configuration.
