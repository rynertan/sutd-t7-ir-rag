# A controllable power source.

## Abstract
A controllable power source is suitable for driving one or more electric motors from a low voltage battery. A converter steps upon the d.c. voltage to a higher level at which the mo tors are designed to operate and a power regulator placed be tween the converter and each motor regulates the power which is drawn at the higher voltage by the motors. A current limit is imposed on the converter which is significantly less than the maximum current handling capabilities of the motors, so that when a motor attempts to draw an excessive current the output voltage of the converter drops accordingly. This en ables the overall power handling capability of the converter to be minimised, whilst still allowing a motor to draw maximum current or maximum voltage, but not both simultaneously.
