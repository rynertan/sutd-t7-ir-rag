Synthesis Many of the compounds of Formula I may be prepared as shown in Equation 4 by the reaction of an appropriately substituted benzenesulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate with an appropriate aminopyrimidine or aminotriazine. The benzenesulfonyl isocyanate and isothiocyanates are therefore important intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of this invention.The synthesis of these compounds is described ln Equations 1 4. Equation 1EMI13.1 wherein A is NR2R3, OCH2CC13, OCR2CBr3, EMI13.2 OCH2CF2Rb orEMI13.3 where Ra is H, C1, CH3, OCH3 or NO2 and Rb is H, F or C1 C2 alkyl with O F and Rc is CH3 or CF3.R1 is H, Cl, Br, F, NO2, C1 C3 alkyl, OCH3, CF3,EMI13.4 or CH2ORd where Rd is C1 C3 alkyl, N CH3 2, CN,EMI13.5 where n is O or 2 R1 is H, C1, F, Br, CH3 or OCH3 R2 is C1 C6 alkyl, C3 C4 alkenyl, C3 C6 cyclc alkyl, C5 C6 cycloalkenyl, C4 C7 cycloalkyl alkyl, C3 C6 cycloalkyl substituted with 1 2 CH3 groups, C3 C5 alkynyl, C CH3 2CN, CH2 m CN, where m is 1 or 2, CF2CF2H, CF2CHCHFC1, CF2CHFBr, CF2CHFCHF3, CH2CF3, CH2CH2OCH3, CH2CH CH3 OCH3, OCH3, CH2 3OCH3, or OCH3, provided that when R2 is OCH3, R3 is CH3, CH R7 CO2R8 or CH R7 CON R8 2, where R7 is H or CH3, and R8 isC1 C3 alkyl or R2 isEMI13.6 where R9 is H, CH3, C1, Br or F R3 is C1 C4 alkyl, C3 C4 alkenyl, CH2CH2OCH3, CH2CH CH3 OCH3, CH2 mCN, where m is 1 or 2, CH R7 C02R8, CH2CF3, or NR2R3 taken together areEMI14.1 provided that when R2 is CF2CHFCl,CF2CHFBr, CF2CF2H, orCF2CHFCF3, then R3 is C1 4 alkyl Also provided that when R1 is CN or N C O, it cannot be in the 3 position. The above reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of the appropriate sulfonamide II , an alkyl isocyanate such as butyl isccyanate and a catalytic arrount of a tertiary amine such as 1,4 diaza 2,2,2 bicyclooctane DABCO in xylene, or other inert solvent of boiling point 1350 to approximately 135 . Phosgene is then added to the mixture over a 1 6 hour period until an excess of phosgene is present as indicated by a drop in the boiling point to less than 1300. The mixture is cooled and filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble by products. The solvent and the alkyl isocyanate are distilled off in vacuo leaving a residue of the crude, sulfonyl isocyanate IIa, which can be used without further purification. The preparation of the sulfonamides, II, is de scribed in Equation 8. The sulfonyl isocyanates, Ila, can also be pre pared, as shown in Equation 2, by first preparing the n butylsulfonylureas III and, reacting the compounds III with phosgene. Equation 2EMI15.1 wherein A, R1, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined in Equation 1. The compounds III are conveniently prepared by stirring a mixture of the sulfonamides, II, anhydrous potassium carbonate, and n butyl isocyanate in acetone or methyl ethyl ketone at 25 800 until all of the isocyanate has reacted. The products are isolated by quenching in dilute mineral acid or by distilling off the solvent and recrystallizing the reside. The compounds III are treated with phosgene and a catalytic amount of DABCO in refluxing xylene or chlorobenzene in a manner analogous to that described in Equation 1. Where W S in Formula 1, the useful isothio cyanate intermediates, IV, are prepared according toEquation 3. Equation 3EMI16.1 wherein A, R1, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined in Equation 1. The substituted sulfonamide is dissolved in dimethylformamide DMF with an equivalent amount of carbon disulfide, and two equivalents of potassium hydroxide are added in portions at room temperature. The mixture is stirred for 1 8 hours then diluted with ethyl acetate, ethyl ether, or other similar aprotic solvent to precipitate the dipotassium salt of the dithiocarbamic acid. The salt is isolated and suspended in an inert solvent such as xylene, chloroform, or carbon tetrachloride. Phosgene is added below room temperature and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 1 3 hours. The sulfonylisothiocyanate is isolated by filtering off the precipitated potassium chloride and concentrating the filtrate.These compounds tend to dimerize on standing and therefore should be used soon after preparation. Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by the reaction described in Equation 4. Equation z EMI17.1 wherein A, R1, Rj, R2 and R3 are as defined in Equation 1 W is oxygen or sulfur P5 is H or methyl EMI17.2 and X is H, CR3, CR3O or CH3CH2O Y is C1, Br, H, C1 C3 alkyl, CF3, NHCH3, N CH3 2, OCH2CF3, OCH3, OCH2CH3, SCH3, CH2CN, NCH2CN, CH2CH2CN, CH2CL, N3, OCH2CH CH2, CH3 OCH2C CH or O CH2 pOR10, where P P is 2 or 3 and R10 is CH3 or CR3CH2, or Y is CH2CH2OCH3, CH2OCH3, OCH R7 CO2R11 or OCH R7 CON R8 2,CO2R11, R7 and R8 are as previously defined and R11 is Hor C1 C3 alkyl X1 is H, OCR3 or CH3 is is H, OCR3, OCH2CH3 or CR3, provided that X1 and Y1 are not both H simultaneously and Z is N or CR. The reaction of Equation 4 is best carried out in inert aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile at a temperature between 20 and 80 . A catalytic amount of DABCO may be used to accelerate the reaction. In the c2ses in which the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent, they may be isolated by simple filtration. When the products are soluble in the reaction solvent they are isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane ethylether, or methanol and filtration. Compounds of Formula 1 in which W S and R5 H can also be prepared by the reaction shown inEquation 5. EMI19.1 wherein A, RI R1,R2, R3 and R6 are as defined in Equations 1 4, and P4 is H or CR3. The reaction of Equation 5 is best carried out by suspending the sulfonamide, the isothiocyanate and an equivalent of a base such as anhydrous potassium carbonate in a solvent sch as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile or ethyl acetate. The reaction is stirred at 25 80a for 1 to 24 hours. In some cases, the product precipitates from the reaction mixture and can be filtered off, suspended in dilute mineral acid, filtered again and washed with cold water. If the product does not precipitate, it can be isolated by evaporation of the solvent, trituration of the residue with dilute mineral acid and filtering off the insoluble product. The heterpcyclic isothiocyanates, VI, which are used in the procedure of Equation 5 are prepared according to the method of Japan Patent Application Pub. Kokai 51 143686, June 5, 1976 or that of W. Abraham andG. Barnikow, Tetrahedron 29, 691 7 1973 both of which are herein incorporated by reference. Compounds of Formula 1 in which W S and R4 R can also be prepared by the procedure shown inEquation 6. Equation 6EMI20.1 wherein A, R , R1 R6 are as defined in Equations 1 5. In the procedure of Equation 6, the aminotriazine or aminopyrimidine is added to a suspension of sodium hydride in dimethylformamide DMF or tetrahydrofuran THF and allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 4 hours. The resulting salt solution or suspension is then added t a solution of the sulfonyl isothiochyanate, in DMF or T and allowed to stir at rpom temperature for 1 4 hours.The product is isolated by quenching the reaction mixture in excess dilute mineral acid and filtering off te insoluble product or by first evaporating the solvent off and triturating the residue in dilute mineral acid and collecting the solid product Alternatively, compounds of Formula I in whichR4 is a methyl group may be prepared by the procedure shown in Equation 7. Equation 7EMI21.1 EMI21.2 whereinA, Rig R1 R6 and W are as defined in Equations 1 6. The reaction of Equation 7 can best be carried out by adding an equivalent of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine, pyridine, or potassium carbonate, to a mixture of the chloride VII, and the aminoheterocyclic, Aa, in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride or acetonitrile. Temperatures of 20 80 may be employed. Soluble products can be isolated by filtering off the precipitated salts and concentration of the filtrate. Insoluble products can be filtered off and washed free of salts with water. The chlorides of Formula VII can be prepared by phosgenation or thiophosgenation of the N methyl sulfon mide salts. The sulfonamide salt is added to an excess of phosgene or thiophosgene in an inert organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride. After removal of the excess phosgene, the chloride VII can be isolated or reacted in situ with the aminoheterocycle via. 2 Mminopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines , Vol. XVI of The Chemistry ofHeterocyclic Compounds , Interscience, New York, and London. The 2 amino 1,3,5 triazines are reviewed by K. R. Huffman, in The Triazines of this same series. The synthesis of triazines is also described inU.S. Patent 3,154,547, and by H. R. Huffman andF. C. Schaeffer, J. Org. Chem. 28, 1816 1821 1963 .All of the above are herein incorporated by reference. The benzenesulfonamides of Formula II which are the starting materials in Equations 1, 2 and 3, can be prepared by the four step procedure described in Equation 8. Equation 8EMI23.1 whereinA, 4 R1, R2, and R3 are as defined in Equations 1 7, with the exception that R1 cannot be NO2. In step 8a, the o nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride in Formula VIII, which are well known in the art, are treated with an amine or an alcohol of Formula VIIIa in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, ethyl ether, or tetrahydrofuran at 0 500. When VIIIa is an amine, it may be taken in excess to act as an acid acceptor or, alternatively, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyrimidine may be used as an acid acceptor. When VIIIa is an alcohol, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyridine must be used as an acid acceptor. The by product amine hydrochloride is filtered off or washed out of the solvent wnth water and the product isolated by evaporation of the solvent. The reduction described in step 8b is accomplished by treating a solution of the compounds of Formula IX, in a solvent such as ethanol, ethyl acetate, or DMF, in a pressure vessel, with 100 1000 pounds per square inch of hydrogen at 80 150 in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as 5 10 palladium absorbed on carbon. When the theoretical amount of hydrogen has been absorbed, the solution is cooled and the catalyst is removed by filtration. The product is then isolated by evaporation of the solvent. In the case where R1 NO2, the reduction of step 8b can be accomplished using ammonium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide instead of catalytic hydrogenation. This type of procedure is described in Organic SynthesisColl. Vol. III, pgs. 242 3, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,New York and London 1955 , the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. The diazotization and coupling with sulfur dioxide described in step 8c, is accomplished in the following manner. A solution of the aniline of Formula X in a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and glacial acetic acid is treated with a solution of sodium nitrite in water at 5 to 00. After stirring for 10 15 minutes at 0 to insure complete diazotization, this solution is added to a mixture of an excess of sulfur dioxide, and z catalytic amount of cuprous chloride in glacial acetic acid at 0 5 . The temperature is kept at 0 5 for 1 4 to 1 hour then raised to 20 25 and held at that temperature for 2 4 hours. This solution is then poured into a large excess of ice water. The sulfonyl chloride products, XI, can be isolated by filtration or by extraction into a solvent such as ethyl ether or methylene chloride followed by evaporation of the solvent. The amination described in step 8d is conveniently carried out by treating a solution of the sulfonyl chloride of Formula XI with an excess of anhydrous ammonia in a solvent such as ethyl ether or methylene chloride at 0 250. If the product sulfonamide, II, is insolubleit may be isolated by filtration followed by washing out the salts with water. If the product sulfonamide is soluble in the reaction solution, it may be isolated by filtering off the precipitated ammonium chloride and evaporation of the solvent. Compounds of Formula 1 in which R1 NH2 can be prepared by the reaction shown in Equation 9. Equation 9EMI25.1 wherein A, R 1,R2 R6 and W are as defined in Equations 1 8. The reduction described in Equation 9 is accomplished by treating a solution of the compounds ofFormula XII in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or D1F in a pressure vessel, with 100 1000 pounds per square inch of hydrogen at 80 150 in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst such as 5 10 palladium absorbed on carbon. When the theoretical amount of hydrogen has been absorbed, the solution is cooled and the catalyst is removed by filtration. The product is then isolated by evaporation of the solvent. Compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by the method described in Equation 10. Equation 10EMI27.1 EMI28.1 wherein A, , and are as described in Equation 1 R12 is methyl, ethyl,EMI29.1 or CH2CO2CH R13 is methyl or ethyl X2 is C1 or Br Y2 is , C1, Br, methyl, ethyl or CF3 y3 is C1 or Br Y4 is methyl, ethyl or CF3 and E is CR3 2N or CH3S Reaction Step 10a In Reaction Step l0a , an aromatic sulfonamide of Formula II is contacted with a heterocyclic isocyanate of Formula XIII to yield an N halohetero cyclicaminocarbonyl arcmatic sulfonamide of FormulaXIV. The heterocyclic isocyanates used in Reaction 10a may be prepared according to methods described in Swiss Patent 579,062, U.S. Patent 3,919,228,U.S. Patent 3,732,223 and Anaew Chem. Int. Ed. 10, 402 1976 , the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The aromatic sulfonamide and the heterocylic isocyanate are contacted in the presence of an inert organic solvent, for example, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran THE , toluene, acetone or butanone. Optionally, a catalytic amount of a base, such as 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane DABCO , potassium carbonate, sodium hydride or potassium tert butoxide, may be added to the reaction mixture. The quantity of base constituting a catalytic amount would be obvious to one skilled in the art. The reaction mixture is preferably maintained at a temperature of about 25 to 1100C, and the product can generally be recovered by cooling and filtering the reaction mixture. For reasons of efficiency and eConomy, the preferred solvents are acetonitrile and THF, and the preferred temperature range is about 60 to 850C.Reaction Steps lOb and lOc In Reaction Steps lOb and lOc , one. or two of the halogen atoms on the heterocyclic ring of the compound of Formula XIV is displaced by a nucleophilic species. Generally, this may be done by contacting the compound of Formula XIV either with alkanol, R120H, or with alkoxide, OR1z, where R12 is as defined above. Thus, in Reaction Step lOb , a compound ofFormula XIV, substituted with one displaceable group, can be contacted with at least one equivalent of alkanol, R120H. This reaction is sluggish, however, and it is preferred to contact the compound ofFormula XIV with at least two equivalents of alkoxide, OR12. The alkoxide can be provided in a number of ways a The compound of Formula XIV can be suspended or dissolved in an alkanol solvent, R120H, in the presence of at least two equivalents of alkoxide, OR12. The alkoxide can be added directly as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxide or can be gen erated by the addition to the alkanol solvent of at least two equivalents of.a base capable of generating al koxide from the solvent.Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, the alkali and alkaline earth metals, their hydrides and tert butoxides. For example, when R12 is methyl, the compound of Formula XIV could be suspended or dissolved in methanol in the presence of two equivalents of sodium methoxide. Alternatively, two equivalents of sodium hydride could be used in place of the sodium methoxide. b The compound of Formula XIV can be suspended or dissolved in an inert solvent in the presence of at least two equivalents of alkoxide, OR12. Suitable inert solvents include, but are not limited to, acetonitrile, TRF and dimethyl ornamide. The alkoxide may be added directly as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxide or may be generated from alkanol and a base as described in a above. For example, when R12 is methyl, the compound of Formula XIV could be suspended or dissolved in TRF in the presence of two ecuiva lents of sodium methoxide. Alterna tively, two ecuivalents each of methanol and sodium hydride could be used instead of sodium methoxide. For reasons of economy and efficiency, procedure a is the more preferred method. It should be noted that two equivalents of alkoxide are required for Reaction Step lOb whereas only one equivalent of alkanol is needed for the same process.This difference is due to the reaction which is believed to occur between the alkoxide and the sulfonyl nitrogen of the sulfonamide of Formula XIV.When alkoxide is used, the first equivalent of alkoxide removes a proton from the sulfonyl nitrogen, and it is only the second equivalent which effects displacement of the halogen. As a result, two equivalents of alkoxide are required. The resulting salt must be acidified, e.g., with sulfuric, hydrochloric or acetic acid, to yield a compound ofFormula XV. Applicant, of course, does not intend to be bound by the mechanism described above. In Reaction Step lOc a compound of Formula XVa, substituted with at least one displacement group, is contacted with either one equivalent of alkanol, P13 OR, or with two equivalents of alkoxide, OR13 where R13 is as described above. The compound of Formula XVa is prepared according to Reaction Step 10b from a compound of Formula XV where Y2 is C1 or Br. When alkoxide, OR13 is used, it may be provided in either of the methods described above in connection withReaction Step lOb , and the resulting salt can be acidified to yield a compound of Formula XSI. When R12 R13, Reaction Steps lOb and lOc may be combined. Thus, a compound of Formula XIV may be contacted either with at least two equivalents of alkanol, R13OH, or with at least three equivalents of alkoxide, OR13. When a compound of Formula XIV contains two displaceable groups, i.e., both X2 and Y2 are C1 or Br, certain reaction conditions will favor displacement of only one of the group. These conditions are the use of low temperatures and, when alkoxide is used, the slow addition of the stoichiometric amount of alkoxie or alkoxide generating base to the medium containing the compound of Formula XIV. When alkoxide is used, both Reaction Steps lOb and 10c are preferably run at temperatures within the range of about 100 to 800C, the range of about 0 to 2DC being more preferred. Reaction Steps lOb and lOc are more sluggish when alkanol is used instead of alkoxide, and more drastic conditions are required for the reaction to go to completion. Thus, iiigher temperatures, up to and including the boiling point of the alkanol itself, are requirea. Reaction Step lOd Reaction Step lOd involves the displacement of the halogen atom in a compound of Formula XIVa by dimethylamino or methylthio nucleophiles. The starting material, a compound of Formula XIVa, is prepared according to Reaction Step 10a , and Y4 is limited to C1 C2 alkyl and CF3. For this reaction, the compound of Formula XIVa is suspended or dissolved in an inert solvent, such as acetonitrile or THF. At least one equivalent of the nucleophilic species and at least two equivalents of a base are then contacted with the starting ma terial. The first equivalent of base is believed to neutralize the sulfonarnido proton. The second equivalent of base generates mercaptide or N CR3 2 from the mercaptan or the dialkylamine. Suitable bases include sodium hydride, sodium methoxide and sodium hydroxide. Suitable reaction temperatures are within the range of abut 10 to 800C, with a range of about 0 to 250C being preferred. The product may be isolated by dilution of the reaction mixture with water, mild acidification and filtration. Compounds of Formula IX, which are intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of Formula II as described in Equation 8, can also be prepared by the procedures shown in Equations 11 and 12. Equation 11EMI34.1 wherein A, R1 and Ri are as described in Equation 1. The o nitroanilines of Formula XVII are well known in the art. The method of converting compoundsXVII to compounds VIII is analogous to that described in Equation 8c . The procedures for converting compounds VIII to compounds IX are described inEquation 8a . Equation 12EMI35.1 wherein A, Rl, and R are as described in Equation 1 B is Cl or Br and M is Na or R. In Step 12a , the compounds of Formula XVIII, which are well known in the art, are reacted with benzyl mercaptan in the presence of an equivalent amount of a base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide.The preferred solvent for this reaction is an alcohol such as methyl, ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. The reaction can be carried out at temperatures between 25 and 800 but temperatures of 50 80eC are preferred.The products of Formula XIX are isolated by cooling the reaction mixture to 0 20 , filtering off the precipitated product, and washing this solid with water to remove the by product alkali halide. In Step 12b , the compound of Formula XIX is suspended in a mixture of 85 95 acetic acid and 5 158 water. This suspension is treated with at least three molar equivalents of chlorine at 0 20 . When a clear solution is obtained, the reaction solution is quenched in an excess of ice water and extracted with a solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or l chlorobutane. The products of Formula VIII are isolated by concentrating this solvent extract in vacuo to remove the solvent and the by product benzyl chloride. The products are oils or low melting solids and may be used directly in the next step or recrystallized first from such solvents as cyclohexane or l chlorobutane. Compounds of Formula IX, in which A includes certain fluoroalkylamine moieties can also be prepared by the procedure shown in Equation 12a. Equation 12aEMI37.1 wherein R and Ri are as previously described R3 is C1 C4 alkyl, and 5 is F, Cl, Br or CF3. The reaction described in Equation 12a is accomplished by heating a mixture of the sulfonamide IX, one or two equivalents of the fluoroolefin and a catalytic amount of base in dimethylformamide solution in a pressure vessel at a temperature of between 60 and 1300 until a pressure drop is no longer observed. Appropriate bases for this reaction include potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride and sodium metal. The products of the reaction are isolated b quenching the reaction mixture in a large excess of water and extraction with n butyl chloride or diethylether.Evaporation of the solvent yields the desired sulfonamide s IXa as viscous oils. Compounds of Formula IX in which A includes a benzyloxyamine group may also be prepared by the procedure described in Equation 12b. Equation 12bEMI38.1 wherein Rl, Ri, R3, R7 and Rg are as previously described. In the first step of Equation 12b, a sulfonyl chloride of Formula XIII is reacted with an appropriate benzyloxyamine, taken in excess to act as an acid acceptor, in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran solution at 0 100. The reaction is completed by stirring at ambient temperature for 4 24 hours. The solvent is evaporated and the product sulfonamide IXc purified by washing the residue with water to remove the byproduct amine hydrochloride. In the second step of Equation 12b, the sulfonamide of Formula IXe is stirred at ambient temperature for 18 24 hours with an excess of both an alkyl iodide and anhydrous potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate in acetone or 2 butanone solution. The solvent is evaporated and the residue partitioned between methylene chloride and water. Concentration of the methylene chloride solution affords the compounds of Formula IXd as pale yellow oils. The compounds of Formula IXd may be converted to compounds of Formula Xd by the procedure described in Equation 12c. Equation 12cEMI39.1 wherein Rl, RI, R3, R7 and Rg are as previously described. The conversion in Equation 12c is accomplished in the following manner A solution of the nitro com pound IXd in 90 aqueous acetic acid is treated with an excess of iron powder 5 g atom mole of IXd at 80 900 in several portions. After heating an addi tional 20 minutes, charcoal is added and the solution filtered through Elites and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is made strongly alkaline with 20 sodium hydroxide then extracted with methylene chloride Concentration of the organic solution yields the anilines of Formula Xd as viscous oils. The compounds of Formual Xd may be converted to the compounds of Formula I by the procedures described in Equations 1 8. Compounds of Formula I in which R2 is hydrogen may be prepared by the procedure described in Equation 12d. Equation 12dEMI40.1 wherein R, Rl, R5 Rg and W are as described previously. In the reaction of Equation 12d, an excess of boron tribromide is added to a suspension of the compound ofFormula Ih in a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene at ambient temperature. The reaction may be completed by stirring at room temperature or it may be necessary to heat the reaction mixture up to 138 for up to 24 hours. After completion, the reaction is quenched by the addition of water and the product triturated with hexane. The products of Formula 12i are solids and are isolated by filtration. The conversion of compounds VIII to compoundsIX is described in Equation 8a . Compounds of Formula I in which R1 is N C O,EMI41.1 can be prepared by the procedures described in Equation 13. Equation 13EMI42.1 wherein A, Ri, R5 and R6 are as previously described is is C1 C3 alkyl and T is O or NH. In Step 13a , the compounds of Formula IIla, which are well known in the art, are added to at least two equivalents of phosgene in an inert solvent such as xylene or chlorobenzene at 0 5 . A slow stream of phosgene is then introduced and the reaction temperature raised to 130 reflux .Refluxing the reaction mixture for 1 2 hours, followed by purgation with nitrogen, filtration, and concentration yields the products of FormulaIIb, as viscous oils. These compounds may be urther purified by vacuum distillation. In Step 13b , the compounds of Formula IIb are reacted with the aminoheterocycles of FormulaV in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile, or tetrahydrofuran at 20 50 over a period of two to twenty four hours. A catalyst, such as DABCO, may be used to accelerate the reaction. The products are isolated by removing the solvent via concentration in vacuo. In Step 13c the compounds of Formula Id are reacted with gamines or alcohols of Formula XXI in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran at 20 800 over a period of two to twenty four hours. The reaction may be accelerated by addition of a catalyst, such as DABCO, and by the use of two equivalents of the amine, XXI. The products, Ie, are isolated by removing the solvent via concentration in vacuo. O Compounds of Formula I in which R1 is NHCRd can be prepared by the reaction described inEquation 14. Equation 14EMI44.1 where in A, R1, Rd, P5 and R6 are as previously described. In the procedure described in Equation 14, the compounds of Formula. If are reacted with an acid chloride of Formula XXII in an inert solvent such as chloroform, methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature in the presence of an acid acceptor such as pyridine or triethylamine. The reaction takes four to twenty four hours for completion. Both the acid chloride, XXII, and the acid acceptor may be taken in excess to haste the completion of the reaction. The products, Ig, are isolated by filtering off the product amine hydrochloride and concentrating the filtrate in vacuo. The crude products thus obtained may be purified by recrystallization or by column chromatography. The compounds of Formula IA can be prepared from the compounds of Formula I in which W is sulfur by the process described in Equation 15. Equation 15EMI45.1 wherein A, R1, X1, Y1 and z are as described previously and B is C1 C6 alkyl CH2CH2OCH3 CH2CH2OCH2CH3 CH2CH2CH2OCH3 CH2o EMI45.2 where Q is CO2 C1 3 alkyl,EMI46.1 Cl 3 alkyl 2,EMI46.2 C1 C3 alkyl , phenyl, phenyl substituted with chlorine, CN, C24 alkenyl, C24 alkynyl, OR 11, where R1 is C1 C4 alkyl, CH2OCH2CH2OCH3 or CH2OCH2CH2OCH2CH3 and M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal. In step 15a the thiourea of Formula Ij is treated with an alkali or alkaline earth alkoxide, hydride, hydroxide or carbonate in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether suspension to obtain the salt Ik at ambient temperature up to 625. In step 15b the salt suspension as solution is treated with the appropriately substituted iodide or bromide at 35 to 620 for 1 4 hours. The reaction mixture is then cooled to ambient temperature. If the product is insoluble, it may be isolated by filtration from the reaction mixture. If the product is soluble in the reaction solvent, it may be isolated by the reaction solvent, it may be isolated by evaporating the solvent and triturating the residue with a solvent such as cyclohexane or l chlorobutane.The product Ia may be purified by recrystallization from a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I and Formula IA are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by rearing compounds of Formula 1 with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficienuly basic anion e.g. hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydride quaternaryamine salts can be made by similar techniques.Detailed examples of such techniques are given inUnited States Patent 4,127,405, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of them can be applied directly.C Spayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few litters to several hundred liters per hectare.High strength compositions are used primarily as concentrates which are to be diluted prior to ultimate use. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least pne of a about 0.1 to 20 surfac,ant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the approximate proportions set forth in Table VI.

Some typical solid diluents are described inWatkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell,New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the censer ones for dusts, Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd Ed.,Interscience, New York, 1950.Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates splution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detergents andEmulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co.,Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending, and usually grinding, as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets can be made by spraying the active material on preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp 8 57ff. or further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example H.

Utilitv The compounds of the present invention are highly active herbicides. They have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, indu strial storage areas, oil well sites, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, some of the subject com pounds are useful for the selective pre or post emergence weed control in crops, such as corn, wheat and rice. By properly selecting rate and time of application, compounds of this invention may be used also to modify plant growth beneficially. The precise amount of the compound of Formula I to be used in any given situation will vary according to the particular end result desired, including their use as selective or general herbicides, the crop species involved, the amount of foliage present, the species of weeds to be controlled, the soil type, the formula tion and mode of application, weather conditions, etc. Since so many variables play a role, it is not possible to state a rate of application suitable for all situa tions. Broadly speaking, the compounds of this inven tion are used at levels of about 0.001 to 10 kg ha with a preferred range of 0.03 to 5 kg ha. In general, the higher rates of application from within this range will be selected for adverse conditions, where ex tended persistence in soil is desired, or for non selective weed control purposes. The compounds of Formula I may be combined with other herbicides and are particularly useful in com nation with substituted urea herbicides such as 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl l,l dimethyl urea the triazines such as 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine the uracils such as 5 bromo 3 sec butyl 6 methyluracil N phosphonomethyl glycine 3 cyclohexyll methyl 6 dimethylamino s triazine 2,4 1H,3H dione N,N dimethyl 2,2 diphenylacetamide 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and closely related compounds 4 chloro 2 butynyl 3 chlorophenylcarbamate diisopropylthiolcarbamic acid ester with 2,3 dichloroallyl alcohol diisopropylthiolcarbamic acid, S 2,3,3 trichloroallyl ester ethyl N benzoyl N 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionate 1,2 dimethyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazolium methylsulfate methyl 2 4 2,4 dichloro phenoxy phenoxy propanoate 4 amino 6 tert butyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl l methoxy l methylurea 3 isopropyl 1H 2,1,3benzothiodiazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide fluoro 2,6 dnnitro N, dipropyl p toluidine 1,1 dimethyl 4,4 bipyridinium ion monosodium methanearsonate 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl methoxymethyl acetanilide and 1,1 dimethyl 3 alpha , alpha , alpha trifluoro m tolyl urea. The activity of these compounds was discovered in greenhouse tests. The tests are described and the data resulting from them are shown below. Test Procedure A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria spp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa cruscalli , wild oats Avena fatua , cassia Cassia tora , morningglory Ipomoea spp. , cocklebur Xanthium spp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat and nutsedge tubers Cyperus rotundus were planted in a growth medium and treated pre emergence with a nonphytotoxic solvent solution of the compounds.At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bush beans with the third trifoliate leaf expanding, crabgrass with two leaves, barnyardgrass with two leaves, wild oats with two leaves, cassia with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , cocklebur with four leaves including cotyledonary ones , sorghum with four leaves, corn with four leaves, soybean with two cotyledonary leaves, rice with three leaves, wheat with one leaf, and nutsedge with three five leaves were sprayed with a nonphytotoxic solvent solution of the compounds.Other containers of the above mentioned weeds and crops were treated pre or post emergence with the same nonphytotoxic solvent so as to provide a solvent control.

deep in Fallsington silt loam soil contained in 10 cm diameter plastic pots. Five tubers were planted in each pot. Compounds of this invention were dissolved in an non phytotoxic diluent and sprayed at 560 l ha in four methods of application soil surface, tuber soil, soil incorporated, and postemergence. The soil surface spray consisted of spraying the compound on the surface of the firmed covering soil. The tuber soil spray consisted of spraying the compound on exposed tubers and subtending soil before adding the untreated covering soil. Soil incorporated treament consisted in mixing the compound with the covering soil before using it to cover the tubers. The post emergence trea uent was sprayed on nutsedge foliage and the surrounding soil surface when nuts edge had emerged and grown to a height of about 12 corn. Pots receiving the post emergence treatments were placed directly in the greenhouse. Pots receiving the other treatments were misted with about 0.3 cm water before being transferred to the greenhouse.Response ratings assessed after four weeks are recorded in Test D, based on the same rating system as described in procedure A.

Approximately 2 1 2 weeks after planting, the young plants and the soil aground them were sprayed overall with the test chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent.Fourteen days after treatment, all species were compared to untreated controls and visually rated for response to treatment. The rating system was as described previously for Test A. The data are pre sented in Test E. It is obvious that these compounds have utility for selective weed control in corn.
