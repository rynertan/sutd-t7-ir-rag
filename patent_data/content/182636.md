# VECTORS FOR HIGH LEVEL GENE EXPRESSION

## Abstract
A method and vectors for high level expression of genes in bacteria are disclosed. According to one aspect, the present in vention provides a method for expressing a gene coding for a desired protein in a bacterium at elevated levels of expression, which comprises ligating at a site adjacent to the translation termination codon of a structural gene for the desired protein, a terminal mRNA sequence from a gene coding for a stable mRNA coding for a bacterial protein situating the ligated gene so formed in a vector that is replicable in the bacterium such that the gene is operabiy linked to a transcription promoter transforming the bacterium with the vector containing the gene and expressing the gene in the transformed bacterium.
