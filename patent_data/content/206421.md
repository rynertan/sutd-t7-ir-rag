# Method of manufacturing a drawing die.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a drawing die, in which a core of, for example, natural of syn thetic diamond is clamped in the cavity intended for this purpose by deforming a cylinder which is made of, for ex ample, a copper alloy. A properly centred core is obtained through the use of a punch by means of which the core is clamped during the de formation of the cylinder in this way tilting of the core is precluded and it is not covered with material of the annulus in places where this is undesirable.
