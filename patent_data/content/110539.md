# Improvements in hydraulic anti skid braking systems for vehicles.

## Abstract
In an hydraulic anti skid braking systems for vehicles, for example motor cycles or light passenger cars, a supply of operating fluid from a supply 15 to a vehicle brake 32 is modulated in accordance with skid signals from skid sens ing means suitably an opto sensor 5, 6 which are electrical in nature, and an hydraulic pump 2 incorporating at least one plunger 10 working in a bore 11 has a working chamber 23 to control brake re application following skid correction. The supply of fluid from the supply to the brake is modulated by a solenoid operated valve assembly 3 which is responsive to the skid signals, the valve assembly incorporating a normally open isolating valve 47 disposed between the source and the brake, and a normally closed dump valve 46 disposed between the brake 32 and a res ervoir 35 for fluid.
