## Description
BENZOPYRAN BENZOTHIAPYRAN AND QUINOLINE COMPOUNDS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING ThEM This invention relates to new compounds, methods for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. A large number of monochromone 2 carboxylic acids are known as anti allergic agents, and a small number of these compounds, in particular the compound described in BritishPatent Specification No 1,488,707, have been disclosed as having the ability to inhibit gastric acid secretion. We have now found that a selected group of compounds have advantageous properties as disclosed herein. According to the invention we provide compounds of formula I,EMI1.1 in which X is O , S or NR3 R3 is hydrogen or alkyl C 1 to 6,A is COOH or 5 lH tetrazolyl , and B is hydrogen, or A and B together form a chain N N NH ,R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy, R2 is hydroxy or esterified hydroxy, R6 is hydrogen or alkyl C 1 to 3, R7 is hydrogen or methyl, and R8 is alkyl C 1 to 4 optionally substituted by phenyl, provided that when B is hydrogen, A is COOs, X is O , R1 is hydrogen, R2 is hydroxy, R6 and b are both hydrogen then R8 is not propyl, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. According to our invention we also provide a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, which comprises a producing a compound of formula I in which A and B together form a chain N N NH by removing a protecting group L from a compound of formula III,EMI2.1 in which X, R1, R2, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, and L is a protecting group, b producing a compound of formula I in which B is hydrogen and A is 5 1H tetrazolyl , by reacting a compound of formula IV,EMI3.1 in which X, R1, R2, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, with an. azide, in solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, c producing a compound of formula I in which R1 orR2 is hydroxy by selectively reducing a compound of formula V,EMI3.2 or a salt, ester or amide thereof, in which X, A, B, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, and R5 represents a group CH2CZCHZ, where one Z represents carbonyl oxygen and the other represents H2, with a suitable selective carbonyl reducing agent, d producing a compound of formula I in which B is hydrogen and A is COOH by hydrolysing a compound of formula VI,EMI4.1 in which D represents a group hydrolyseable to COOH, and X, R1, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, e producing a compound of formula I in which B is hydrogen and A is COOH by cyclising a compound of formulaVII,EMI4.2 in which R1, R2, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, A1 and A2 A1 and A2 represent the pairs of groups i COCH2COCOR and OM, or ii H and X C COR CH COR X is as defined above, R represents OM, or a group which is hydrolysable thereto, and M represents hydrogen or a cation, and if necessary or desired hydrolysing the group COR , to a group COOM, f reacting a compound of formula VIII,EMI5.1 or a salt, ester or amide thereof, in which X, A, B, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, with propylene oxide or a compound of formula.IX, R1CH2CHR2CH2G IX in which G is a good leaving group, g producing a compound of formula I in which R1 andR2 are both hydroxy by i hydrolysing a compound of formula X,EMI6.1 or a salt, ester or amide thereof, in which X, A, B, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, or ii subjecting a compound of formula XI,EMI6.2 in which X, A, B, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, or a salt, ester or amide thereof, to mammalian metabolism, or iii reaction of a compound of formula XII,EMI6.3 or a salt, ester or amide thereof, in which X, A, B, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined above, with osmium tetroxide, and hydrolysis of the resulting complex, or h producing a compound of formula I in which R2 is esterified hydroxy, by reaction of a corresponding compound of formula I, or a salt, carboxylic ester or amide thereof, in which R2 is hydroxy with an appropriate acid, or a derivative thereof, and where desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I to a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or vice versa. In process a L may be an N protecting group removable by acidolysis with a strong acid. Suitable examples of L include labile benzyl groups or triphenylmethyl. Examples of labile benzyl groups include benzyl substituted in the phenyl ring by one or more C 1 4 alkoxy groups, for example 4 methoxy , 2,4 dimethoxy or 2,4,6 trimethoxybenzyl. A particularly suitable example of L is 4 methoxybenzyl. Suitable acids include trifluoroacetic and methanesuiphonic acids. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from 25 to 150 0C, preferably 50 to 7O0C. LI may also be an N protecting group removable by hydrogenolysis. Examples of such groups include l phenylalkyl groups, particularly benzyl. The hydrogenolysis may conveniently be carried out using conventional techniques known per se. Suitable solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions of process b include those in which both the reagents are soluble, e.g. N,N dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl glycol and ethyl methyl glycol. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 200 to 1300C, The azide used in the reaction is preferably ammonium or an alkali metal azide, e.g. sodium or lithium azide. The reaction may, if desired, be carried out in the presence of an electron acceptor, e.g. aluminium chloride, boron trifluoride, ethyl sulphonic acid or benzene sulphonic acid. Alternatively the reaction may be carried out using hydrazoic acid under greater than atmospheric pressure.When an azide other than hydrazoic acid is used, e.g.sodium azide, the product of the reaction will be the corresponding tetrazole salt. This salt mÅay readily be converted to the free acid by treatment with strong acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid. Suitable selective carbonyl reducing agents in process c include potassium or sodium borohydride, or aluminium isopropoxide. The reduction may be carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. ethanol or dioxan, at a temperature of from about 5 to 750C. In process d , the group D may be, for example, an ester, preferably a lower alkyl ester, e.g. methyl or ethyl an acid halide, e.g. chloride an amide, e.g. CONRxRy, where one or both of Rx and Ry represent hydrogen, or lower alkyl, e.g. methyl or ethyl or a nitrile group, which may be hydrolysed to a COOH group. The hydrolysis may be carried out using acid conditions, for example, using a hydrogen halide, e.g. hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride in acetic acid, or a mixture of aqueous dioxan and hydrochloric acid, or under mildly basic conditions, e.g. using sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, in a suitable solvent, inert to the reaction conditions, for example a lower alcohol, e.g. ethanol or methanol. The hydrolysis may be carried out at a temperature of from about 5 to 1200C, depending on the compounds used. The cyclisation of process e i may be carried out by heating, or under basic or neutral conditions. It is however preferred to carry out the cyclisation in the presence of an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, and in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g.ethanol. The reaction may be carried out at from about 200 to 150 0C. The group COR is preferably an ester group, e.g. R may be a lower alkoxy group. When M is a cation it may be, for example, an alkali metal cation. The cyclisation of process e ii may be carried out by treating the compound of formula VII with a cyclising agent, for example a dehydrating agent such as chlorosulphonic, polyphosphoric or sulphuric acid. The reaction is preferably carried out under anhydrous conditions and may be carried out at a temperature of from about 0 to 1000C. Alternatively, cyclisation may be achieved by converting the free carboxy groups of the compound of formula VII to acyl halide groups and subjecting the resulting acyl halide to an intramolecularFriedel Crafts reaction. As a further alternative, particularly when X is NR3 , the cyclisation may be carried out by heating, e.g. to a temperature of 200 to 3000C, with or without a solvent. In process f the good leaving group G may be, for example, an anion forming group, e.g. a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or an alkane sulphonate group. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g.dimethylformamide, and in the presence of a strong base, e.g. sodium hydride. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 25 to 1500C. The reaction involving propylene oxide may be carried out without a solvent or in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g., dimethylformamide. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 750 to 1750C in the presence of a base, e.g., sodium hydroxide or thallous ethoxide. The hydrolysis of process g i is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium, e.g. water, and under mildly basic or mildly acidic conditions. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature of from about 5 to 50 C, e.g. at room temperture. Process g ii may be carried out by administering the starting material to a suitable mammal or mammalian extract. The starting material may conveniently be administered in an aqueous medium, and the desired product may be isolated from the animal s urine, or from the extract, using conventional processes, e.g. high performance liquid chromatography. The reaction of process g iii may be carried out in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, and conveniently is carried out at about room temperature. In process h the esterification may be carried out by reacting the free OH group with a compound RCOG in which G is as described above for process f and may also be O alkanoyl or trifluoroacetyl. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a non nucleophilic proton acceptor, e.g. triethylamine or pyridine. Where the ester is with a dicarboxylic acid the starting material may be reacted with an appropriate anhydride. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. a polar aprotic solvent such as 1,4 dioxan, dimethylformamide 6r N methyl pyrrolidone, or a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane or dichloroethane. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 0 to 1050C. In processes c , f , g and h when an ester starting material is ,used we prefer it to be a C 1 to 6, e.g. an ethyl, ester. The starting materials for the above processes may be made by the processes described in the Examples or by processes analogous thereto or by processes analogous to those described above. Thus the compounds of formula III may be prepared by processes analogous to processes c , f , g i , g iii or h or by conventional processes known per se. The compound of formula IV may be made from the corresponding free acid or from known compounds using conventional techniques known per se, e.g. conversion of the acid to an amide and dehydration of the amide to yield the nitrile. The compounds of formula V may be made by reacting a compound of formula VIII with a reagent R5G in whichR5 and G are as defined above, in the presence of a proton acceptor, e.g. potassium carbonate, in a solvent inert to the reaction conditions, e.g. acetone, at a temperature of from about 5 to 85 C. The compounds of formula V in which R5 represents CE2COCH3 may also be made by reacting the corresponding compound of formula VIII or an ester, amide or salt thereof, with HC CH2G, where G is as defined above e.g. bromine in the presence of a proton acceptor, e.g. potassium carbonate, in a suitable solvent, e.g.acetone, to give an intermediate in which R5 represents CH2 C CH, followed by hydration of the acetylenic bond using water, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g.mercuric chloride or mercuric acetate, in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethanol, containing an acid, e.g.p toluenesulphonic acid. The compounds of formula VI may be made by processes analogous to process c , e , f , g i , g iii or h . The compounds of formulae VII, VIII, IX, X, XI andXII are either known, or may be made from known compounds using conventional methods known per ee. The compounds of formula I and the intermediates therefore may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques. Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of formula I include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and, where A is COOH, esters and amides of the 2 carboxylic acid group. Suitable salts include ammonium, alkali metal e.g. sodium, potassium and lithium and alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium or magnesium , and salts with suitable organic bases, e.g. salts with hydroxylamine, lower alkyl amines, e.g. hydroxy substituted alkylamines such as tris hydroxymethyl methylamine, or with simple monocyclic nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, e.g. piperidine or morpholine. Suitable esters include simple C 1 to 6 alkyl esters, e.g. the ethyl or butyl ester, esters derived from alcohols containing basic groups, e.g. di lower alkyl amino substituted alkanols such as the 2 diethylamino ethyl ester, and acyloxy alkyl esters, e.g. a lower acyloxy lower alkyl ester such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester, or a bis ester der ived from a di hydroxy compound, e.g. a di hydroxy lower alkyl ether, e.g. the bis 2 oxapropan 1,3 diyl ester. The esters may be made by conventional techniques, e.g. esterification, transesterification or reaction of the acid, or a salt thereof, with an appropriate compound containing a good leaving group.The amides may be, for example, unsubstituted or mono or di C 1 to 6 alkyl amides and may be made by conventional techniques, e.g. reaction of an ester ofthe corresponding acid with ammonia or an appropriate amine. The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals in particular they are useful because they inhibit the release and or action of pharmacological mediators which result from the in vivo combination of certain types of antibody and specific antigen, e.g. the combination of reaginic antibody with specific antigen see Example 27 of BritishPatent Specification No. 1,292,601 . In man, both subjective and objective changes which result from the inhalation of specific antigen by sensitised subjects are inhibited by prior administration of the new compounds.Thus the new compounds are indicated for use in the treatment of asthma, e.g. allergic asthma. The new compounds are also indicated for use in the treatment of so called intrinsic asthma in which no sensitivity to extrinsic antigen can be demonstrated . The new compounds may also be of value in the treatment of other conditions in which antigen antibody reactions are responsible for disease, for example, hay fever certain eye conditions, e.g. trachoma alimentary allergy, e.g. urticaria and atopic eczema and gastrointestinal allergy, especially in children, e.g. milk allergy. The new compounds may also be used for the prevention or inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and or the treatment of conditions normally involving excess gastric acid secretion, e.g. peptic, duodenal, gastric, recurrent or stormal ulceration, dyspepsia, duodenitis, ZollingerEllison syndrome, reflux oesophagitis and the management of haemorrhage, e.g. from erosion or ulcers, in the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially when a major blood vessel is not involved. The compounds may also be used to reduce the chance of haemorrhage in patients with severe hepatic failure who are known to be at special risk. The above conditions may be treated whether or not they are associated with excess gastric acid secretion. For the above mentioned uses the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration and the treatment desired. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered at a dosage of from 0.1 to 50 mg per kg of animal body weight in the test set out inExample 27 of the British Patent Specification No.1,292,601. For man the indicated total daily dosage is in the range of from lmg to 3,500mg preferably from lmg to 3,000mg and more preferably from lmg to 600mg, which may be administered in divided doses from 1 to 6 times a day or in sustained release form. Thus unit dosage forms suitable for administration by inhalation or oesophageally comprise from 0.17mg to 600mg, preferably 0.17mg to 500mg and more preferably from 0.17mg to 100mg of the compound preferably admixed with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or adjuvant. The compounds of formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, have the advantage that they are more efficacious in certain pharmacological models, are more readily absorbed, are longer acting, e.g.when inhaled, are more active, have less undesirable side effects or possess other advantageous properties than compounds of similar structure to the compounds of formula I. According to the invention there is also provided a process for the production of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I, which comprises treating a compound of formula I or, where A is a COOH group an ester thereof, or another salt thereof, with a compound containing an available pharmaceutically acceptable cation and capable of converting the compound of formula I or the salt or ester thereof, to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the acidic function Compounds capable of converting the compound of formula I, or the salt or ester thereof, to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof include compounds, e.g. bases and ion exchange resins, containing pharmaceutically acceptable cations, e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium and appropriate nitrogen containing organic cations. In the compounds of formula I we prefer B to be hydrogen and A to be 5 lH tetrazolyl or more preferably COOH. R3 may be hydrogen or alkyl C 1 to 3, e.g.ethyl. We particularly prefer X to be S or O . R is preferably hydrogen. R2 is preferably OH or an ester thereof with a C 1 to 7 hindered mono carboxylic acid, e.g. pivalic acid, or with an aryl C7 to 12 acid, e.g. benzoic acid or with a C3 to 7 dibasic acid, e.g.glutaric or succinic acid. R6 may be, for example, hydrogen, ethyl or propyl. R7 is preferably hydrogen.R8 is preferably ethyl, propyl, butyl or benzyl.According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising preferably less than 80 , and more preferably less than 50 by weight of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Examples of suitable adjuvants, diluents or carriers are for tablets, capsules and dragees microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, diatomaceous earth, a sugar such as lactose, dextrose or mannitol, talc, stearic acid, starch, sodium bicarbonate and or gelatin for suppositories, natural or hardened oils 6r waxes and for inhalation compositions, coarse lactose or aerosol propellants.The compound of formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, preferably is in a form having a mass median diameter of from 0.01 to 10 microns. The compositions may also contain suitable preserving, stabilising and wetting agents, solubilizers, sweetening and colouring agents and flavourings.
