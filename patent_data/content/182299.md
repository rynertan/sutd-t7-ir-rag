## Description
This invention relates to a vinylidene fluoride elastomer composition containing a specific iminium compound as an accelerator. Cured vinylidene fluoride elastomers fluoro rubber have been used for various purposes such as O rings, gaskets, diaphragms, hoses, sheets, rools and the like, and demand for these elastomers has recently increased more and more. There have been proposed hitherto many kinds of vinylidene fluoride elastomer compositions containing a polyhydroxy aromatic compound as a curing or cross linking agent to improve compression set and scorch resistance properties. The improvement of these properties has been studied mainly from the view point of development of a curing accelerator to be used together with the polyhydroxy aromatic compound being a curing agent. For example, U.S. Patents 3,655,727 and 3,876,654 teach the use of a quaternary phosphonium compound as a curing accelerator. U.S. Patent 3,655,727 also teaches the quaternary ammonium compound. The specific quaternary ammonium compound of 8 alkyl or 8 aralkyl 1,8 diaza bicyclo 5,4,0 7 undecenium and the amino phosphinic derivatives are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,857,807 and 4,259,463, respectively. In addition, the Bis triarylphosphin iminium compound was recently reported in European Patent Application No. 841031 26.3 EPO 0120462 AI . However, the values of compression set, especially at high temperatures, of the rubbers obtained from these fluoroelastomer compositions do not reach adequately satisfactory levels. Further, when the rate of curing is retarded by a reduction in the amount of the curing accelerator in order to prepare complicated or thick gage articles, adhesion of the cured elastomer to a mold occurs which induces the appearance of defects in the articles and contamination of the mold. In the case of a composition employing the quaternary ammonium compound, in addition to the above problems, there are some other problems, which are induced by hygroscopic and deliquescent properties. These problems include the necessity of the troublesome consideration for safety storage of the composition and a decrease in the curing property as well as various properties of the obtained cured elastomer. In the case of the Bis triarylphosphin iminium compound, as shown in EXAMPLES hereinafter, the cured elastomer obtained shows higher compression set, especially at higher temperature, low elongation and large variations of strain property in the thermal aging test. The object of the present invention is to provide a vinylidene fluoride elastomer composition having excellent characteristics regarding curing properties processability, storability and mold releasing as well as compression set without losing the good thermal, oil and chemical resistance shown by the conventional compositions. The present invention is directed to a curable fluoroelastomer composition comprising As illustrated above, the primary characteristic point of the present invention resides in that the special iminum compound b represented by the general formula 1 is employed as a curing accelerator. The cured elastomer of the present invention is more excellent in compression set, elongation and strain properties than the cured elastomer obtained from a Bis triarylphosphine iminum compound. Among the iminum compounds b shown by the formula 1 , preferred compounds have an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group as R₁. An unsubstituted phenyl group is more preferable. A more preferable substituent of the substituted phenyl group among the substituents described above, is an alkyl or alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferable groups of R₂ are an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms and a substituted aralkyl group having a C₇ C₂₀ aralkyl skeleton. Preferable substituents of the substituted aralkyl group are an alkyl or alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl group and halogen which are bonded to a phenyl part of the aralkyl group. A benzyl group is the most preferable group. In the general formula 1 , as will be understood by a person skilled in the art, the charge of X is not limited to mono valence, and therefore, means mono and poly valence. Representative compounds b are described hereinafter in accordance with each of the preferable groups of R₁ and R₂.

The present invention will now be further described by means of specific examples which are not intended to be limitive of the scope of the invention. To a solution of 3.15 mmol of C₆H₅ ₂P ₂NH in 30 ml of benzene, is added 3.15 mmol of a butyl lithium hexane solution diluted by 10 ml of benzene, and the reaction is conducted under reflux for one hour. After the resultant mixture is allowed to cool, a white precipitate is produced by the addition of 6.30 ml of benzylchloride. The solvent is removed by distillation, and the obtained residue is mixed with 35 ml of ethylether followed by reflux under boiling temperature. A white precipitate is filtered and washed two times by 15 ml of ethylether. The precipitate is dissolved into 15 ml of ethanol. The white crystal of Bis benzyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride is produced by the addition of 10 ml of petroleum ether to the ethanol solution.

The same procedure as in Example 1 is repeated except that 0.45 parts by weight of Bis benzyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride is employed instead of 0.34 parts by weight of Bis methyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride. The results are shown in Table 2. The same procedure as in Example 1 is repeated except that a fluoroelastomeric terpolymer Viton B trade name of E.I. duPont de Nemours Company, and concerning the terpolymer of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropene and tetrafluoroethylene, having a Mooney ML The results are shown in Table 2.

The results are shown in Table 2. As shown in Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4, the present composition exhibits excellent elongation and a significant advance in the compression set values in comparison with the known composition containing a Bis triallylphosphine iminum salt. In order to test the amount of Bisphenol AF, the same procedures as in Example 2 are repeated by employing the various amounts of Bisphenol AF shown in Table 3. The results are shown in Table 3. These examples illustrate compositions containing the sulfone compound. In Example 11, one part by weight of dimethyl sulfone is added to the composition of Example 2, and then the same procedure as in Example 2 is repeated, except that a press cure of 5 minutes is used instead of 10 minutes. In Example 12, the procedure of Example 11 is repeated by using 3.0 parts by weight of dimethyl sulfone instead of 1.0 part of the sulfone. In Example 13, the procedure of Example 11 is repeated by using 3.0 parts by weight of dibutyl sulfone instead of 1.0 part of dimethyl sulfone.

In Comparative Example 8, the composition employed is the same as that for Example 3 except that 0.60 parts by weight of Benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride is used instead of Bis benzyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride, and twenty minutes of press curing is used instead of the 10 minutes in Example 3. The results are shown in Table 5. As is clear from the data in Table 5, the present composition shows excellent thermal resistance as well as the known composition containing benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride in comparison with the composition containing Bis triarylphosphine iminum chloride. There is no influence in the thermal resistance in spite of the presence of the sulfone compound. These examples illustrate the storage stability of the present compositions. The compositions obtained from the step concerning standing over one night in Examples 2 and 11 are allowed to stand for an additional one week at 40 C and 90 of humidity, and then the same procedures are used with Examples 2 and 11. The results are shown in Table 6 together with the results of Examples 2 and 11. There is no transition in the curing properties, and the present composition shows an excellent storage stability. A mold releasing property is tested in these Examples. The same procedure as in Example 1 is repeated except that 0.15 parts by weight of Bis benzyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride is used instead of 0.34 parts of Bis methyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride and 60 minutes of press curing is employed instead of 10 minutes Example 21 . In order to make a comparison, the procedure of Example 21 is repeated by using 0.11 parts by weight of the known benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride instead of 0.15 parts of Bis benzyldiphenylphosphine iminum chloride. The results are shown in Table 7. The present composition is superior in the mold releasing property to the composition containing the known benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride. The similar procedures of Example 2 are repeated by using another fluoroelastomeric copolymer Tecnoflone NML and Tecnoflone NM trade name of Montedison S.P.A. a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropene and having a Mooney ML The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways.
