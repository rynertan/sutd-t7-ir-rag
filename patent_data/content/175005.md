## Description
5,6,7 QUINOLINE CARBAMATES It has now been found that quinoline carbamates are active antilipolytic agents as evidenced by the myocardial lipase and the rat adipocyte assays. Lipolysis is associated with ischemic heart disease free fatty acid has a detrimental effect on the ischemic heart by disrupting electrical conduction, decreasing myocardial efficiency and preventing the transfer of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, in and out, respectively, of the mitochondria.Interventions which depress myocardial oxygen consumption in animals and man provide a protective effect against ischemic injury. This invention relates to compounds useful in the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertriglyceridemia and having the structure EMI1.1 and salts thereof, wherein each R1 is H, alkyl, alkoxy, carboxyl, alkylcarboxy, acylamino, dialkylamino, trihalomethyl, halogen, nitro, hydroxy or cyano each R2 is H, monosubstituted or independently disubstituted hydroxy, alkyl, halogen, nitro, alkoxy, carboxyl, alkylcarboxy, trihalomethyl, cyano, dialkylamino or acylamino Z is 0 or S each X is an alkylene chain containing up to 7 carbon atdms in the principal chain and a total of up to 10 carbon atoms and n is 1 or 2. The alkyl group and the alkyl moieties in alkoxy and alkylcarboxy contain 1 to 7 carbon atoms and may be a straight or a branched chain. Such groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, amyl, isoamyl and the like. The trihalo and halogen include F, C1, Br or I. The aryl group is preferably phenyl or naphthyl. The compounds of this invention may be readily prepared by reacting the appropriate quinolinol or quinolylalkanol with various substituted phenyl or phenylalkyl isocyanates. The reaction is thermally reversible and for that reason the preferred procedure involves the mixing of the two reactants in ethyl ether with a small amount of triethylamine present as a catalyst and stirring at room temperature for several days. The procedure for preparing compounds in which Z is 0 is as follows EMI3.1 For compounds in which Z is S, the corresponding isothiocyanates are used as reactants. The procedure is accomplished by merely contacting the reactants under carbamate forming conditions, i.e., in a solvent allowing the reaction to proceed at ambient, i.e., room, temperature.The use of higher temperatures up to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture will shorten the time required.A wide variety of solvents can be employed, the sole requirement being that the solvent be substantially unreactive with the reactants and capable of dissolving the reactants. Diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and similar solvents can be employed. After the reaction is complete, the product can be isolated by any of the commonly employed procedures, e.g., allowing the product to crystallize from the reaction mixture on cooling, with or without concentration of the reaction mixture before cooling by removal of solvent. Salts of the present new compounds can be formed using acids such as hydrochloric, perchloric, sulfuric, nitric, benezesulfonic and toluene sulfonic acids as well as other acids commonly employed for this purpose. Those compounds which contain a free carboxy group can form salts with bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide and the like. Of particular value are the salts which are pharmaceutically acceptable. The desired starting materials and intermediates can be prepared from readily available material using standard organic reactions. The invention will be more fully illustrated in the examples that follow. These examples are given by way of illustration and are not to be considered as limiting. EXAMPLE 1 To a solution of 7 hydroxyquinoline 1.45 g.,Pfaltz and Bauer H17880 and 4 methoxyphenyl isocyanate 1.49 g. in ethyl ether 100 ml was added triethylamine 1.4 ml . The reaction was stirred for two days at room temperature. The resulting precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from ethyl ether. In like manner as above, using appropriate starting materials and reagents, the following compounds were prepared EXAMPLE 2 6 Quinolyl 4 methoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 3 5 Quinolyl 4 methoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 4 7 Quinolyl 2 methoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 5 6 Quinolyl 2 methoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 6 5 Quinolyl 2 methoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 7 7 Quinolyl 3 methoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 8 7 Quinolyl 4 carbethoxy carbanilate. EXAMPLE 9 7 Quinolyl 2 chloro carbanilate. EXAMPLE 10 7 Quinolyl 2 methyl carbanilate. EXAMPLE 11 7 Quinolyl 2 trifluoromethyl carbanilate. EXAMPLE 12 7 Quinolyl 4 methoxy phenethyl carbamate. The compounds of the present invention exhibit activity in the myocardial lipase assay and the rat adiopocyte assay.Myocardial Lipase Assay All compounds were dissolved in DMSO final concentration 3.0 and tested in duplicate at a concentration of 100 sM. Canine cardiac lipases were obtained by extracting washed heart membranes with buffer plus heparin and a small amount of tritonX 100 detergent. Because these enzymes are only active at an oil water interface, the enzyme reaction is run in an oil water elusion that contains triolein substrate, tris buffer 50 mM, ph 6.8 and a small amount of bovine serum albumin 0.5 added to stabilize the emulsion. A small amount of tritatiated triolein was added to the unlabelled triolein substrate.Tritium labelled oleic acid released by the lipases was extracted into hexane, separated from unreacted triolein and counted in a scintillation counter.Inhibitory agents reduce the amount of radioactivity appearing in the free fatty acid fraction isolated in the extraction procedure.Rat Adipocyte Assay Abdonimal fat pads were removed from male rats weighing 200 250 grams and placed in Krebsbicarbonate buffer gassed with 95 02 5 CO2. The fat pads were digested with collagenase for 1 hour at 370C., washed twice with Krebs bicarbonate buffer and distributed among a set of 20 ml plastic counting vials. Two such vials received only buffer and cells 4 ml but no agonists or antagonists. The remaining vials received epinephrine 3 jiM plus the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methylisobutylxanthine 10 M .Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO or water to a concentration of 20 mM and 40 1 was added to the buffer plus cells in the counting vials. The final compound concentration for routine screening was 200 FM final concentration of DMSO 1 . The cells were incubated for 1 hour at 370C.under 95 2 5 CO2 atmosphere. The incubation was stopped by placing the vials in crushed ice. The cells and medium were transferred to test tubes, centrifuged and the cell layer removed by aspiration.The aqueous phase was assayed for glycerol using the enzyme glycerol dehydrogenase. The glycerol dehydrogenase assay for glycerol depends on the enzyme catalyzed conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde and NAD to NADH. The assay can detect as little as 5 10 nanomoles of glycerol. The aqueous phase, following removal of cells, usually contained about 50 to 80 nanomoles of glycerol per 300 jil of assayed sample if no inhibitory activity was present. Samples from the control tubes no agonist usually contained 0 5 nanomoles of glycerol per 300 jil of sample. The results obtained on representative compounds of the present invention are shown inTable I. The therapeutic compounds of this invention may be administered to a mammal alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, the proportion of which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The physician will determine the dosage of the present therapeutic agents which will be most suitable and it will vary with the form of administration and the particular compound chosen, and also, it will vary with the particular patient under treatment. He will generally wish to initiate treatment with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound and increase the dosage by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. The therapeutic dosage will generally be from a couple of mg. to about 30 mg kg of body weight or higher. Salts of the present new compounds can be prepared by using standard known procedures by reacting the selected acid or base with the new compound.Salts with acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric, benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic and similar acids are particularly useful for therapeutic purposes. Salts of the those compounds including free carboxyl groups can be formed with bases to provide the sodium, potassium and calcium salts which are also useful for therapeutic purposes.
