# Rotary magnetic head drum apparatus.

## Abstract
Helical scan type video tape recorder having respective small projecting members 21a, 21b provided on a fixed drum 2 of a rotary magnetic head assembly in the vicinity of switching positions 0 , 180 at the entrance and exit sides for a magnetic tape 3 . The members 21a, 21b cause the magnetic tape 3 locally to be displaced radially outward from the surface of the fixed drum 2 so as to reduce longitudinal vibration of the magnetic tape 3 and hence reduce impact error in a signal reproduced from the magnetic tape 3 by two rotary magnetic heads 12a, 12b .
