# Method for manufacture of silicon nitride.

## Abstract
Silicon nitride of improved quality is obtained by using a liquid siiicic acid or modified liquid silicic acid as a silicic substance and carbon in a powdered form, a precursor of carbon in a powdered form, or a precursor of carbon in the form of a solution as a carbonaceous substance, and thermally treating these raw materials in a nonoxidative atmosphere containing nitrogen. By this method, α type silicon nitride can be easily obtained. Particularly, finely divided α type silicon nitride suitable for use as the raw material for the production of high strength sintered articles is also produced. α type silicon nitride whiskers useful as a reinforcing material for ceramic and metallic articles is also obtained.
