# A method and apparatus for measuring radon beneath and above the level of the ground.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for measuring at least one of the parameters flow rate, flow velocity, concentration and quantity of radon and or radon daughters in the ground. The method is characterized by collecting gas arriving from the ground in a first chamber 12 which is gas permeable at the bottom thereof, at least the downwardly extending boundaries 11 of the chamber being in contact with the ground, so that atmospheric gas is prevented from passing into the chamber. At least one detector 15 which measures alpha radiation from the decomposition of radon and radon daughters is placed in a second chamber 16 communicating with the first chamber. Positioning of the second chamber and the detector is selected so that the detector can continuously be observed and utilized for the measuring operation. The gas is allowed to pass continuously through the chambers 12, 16 over a given period of time, to expose the detector to the gas. Subsequent to this exposure, the measuring result registered on the detector is evaluated. The method can be modified for measuring radon departure from the surface of the ground, the gas permeable first chamber being arranged over the surface of the ground to be analyzed. The detector is placed in a second chamber 16 communicating with the first chamber. For the purpose of measuring the flow rate and velocity of radon passing through the ground there is provided a first chamber 12 beneath the level of the ground, at a desired depth. This first chamber is connected with a gas impermeable passage 13 to a second chamber 16 which can be readily reached from the level of the ground and which is sealed against penetration or atmospheric air. The detector 15 is placed in the second chamber 16 .
