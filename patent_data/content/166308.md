# Apparatus and method for narrow line width pattern fabrication.

## Abstract
The formation of lines 2 of the order of 0,8 nanometers wide is achieved using a tunneling current through a gas 6 that changes to provide a residue that is the basis of the line 2 . The tunneling current energy is tuned to the energy re quired to dissociate the gas 6 . The radius of the tunnel tip 3 and the tip 3 to substrate 1 distance S are of the order of less than ten nanometers.
