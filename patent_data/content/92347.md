# Wraparound closure.

## Abstract
A wrap around sleeve 3 for enclosing a cable join 1 has opposing edge portions 8 which can be held together to maintain the sleeve in a wrapped configuration. An adhe sive coated flap 9 lies under the edge portions 8 to form a seal between them. When the enclosure is to be re entered, a central part of the sleeve is cut away, and a new sleeve in stalled to bridge the butts of the old sleeve which are al lowed to remain on the cable 1 . In order to avoid leak paths between the edge portions 8 of the remaining butts, adhesive 15 from the flap is ailowed to flow between the edge portions 8 on original installation. This is achieved by providing localised separation 16 between the original edge portions 8 .
