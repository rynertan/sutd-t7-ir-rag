# A method for sputtering a pin or nip amorphous silicon semiconductor device with the P and N layers sputtered from boron and phosphorus heavily doped targets.

## Abstract
A silicon PIN amorphous silicon semiconductor device is constructed by the sputtering of N and P layers of silicon from silicon doped targets and the I layer from an undoped target, and at least one semi transparent ohmic electrode.
