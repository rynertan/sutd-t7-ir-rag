# Wood working machine.

## Abstract
This concerns a machine press for woodworking, particu larly to produce mortises and tenons, and characterized by its simple construction, yet allowing rapid and accurate opera tion. This woodworking press comprises a base 10 , a first carriage 16 slidable to and from relative to a cutting tool, a second carriage 21 slidable on the first carriage transversely relative to the direction of the first carriage, an actuation arm 35 pivotally connected to the base and to the second carriage to selectively displace either carriage in its corresponding direction, a crank readily accessible to adjust the cutting tool in height with respect to the two carriages and various abut ments and adjustable stops to rapidly poposition the piece of wood or board, and produce the desired depth and lengths of cuts.
