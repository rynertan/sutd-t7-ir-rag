## Description
METHOD OF WELDING TUBE TO TUBE PLATEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates, in the pro diction of a heat exchanger, to a method of welding tubes to a tube plate. More particularly, the invention is concerned with a method of welding tubes to a tube plate with a good form of weld bead. Hitherto, there have been proposed various methods of welding tubes to tube plate, among which the following methods 1 to 3 are adopted most ordinarily. 1 A full insertion type method in which the tube is fully inserted into the tube receiving bore of the tube plate before it is welded to the latter. 2 A butt weld type method in which the tube end is held in spigot with the tube plate surface around the tube receiving bore and welded by so called butt welding method. 3 A partly inserted type method in which, as shown in Fig. 1, the end of a tube 2 is welded to the wall of the tube receiving bore 6 of the tube plate 1 while it is partly received by the bore 6. As to the detail of these conventional welding methods, a reference shall be made to an article entitled DEVELOPMENT OF TUBE TO TUBE SHEET 0 WELDING TYPE FOR FAST BREEDER REACTOR HEAT EXCHANGER by N. Mase et al, in Hitachi Hyoron Vol. 59, page 747 September, 1977 . Among these conventional welding methods, the welding method 3 of partly insertion type takes advantages of both of the preceding methods I and 2 . Namely, this welding method 3 excludes the possibility of occurrence of crevice corrosion because no gap is left between the tube and the tube plate after the welding.In addition, this welding method permits the welded part to be examined by radioactive ray or the like to ensure a high reliability of the welded structure, This welding method, however, suffers the following disadvantages This partly inserted type welding method is conducted by forming a plurarnity of tube receiving bores 6 in the tube plate 1, inserting each tube at its end to the bore 6 by a predetermined depth a, inserting a welding torch 5 from the outer side of the tube plate I into each tube receiving bore 6 and setting the same at a predetermined position, and rotating the welding torch 5 around its axis in accordance with a control signal derived from an automatic welder not shown . As will be clearly seen from Fig. 1, the tube receiving bore 6 formed in the tube plate 1 has an inside diameter D greater than the outside diameter d of the tube 2, in order that the tube 2 may be smoothly inserted into the bore 6 The relationship between the inside diameter D of the bore 6 and the. outside diameter dl of the tube 2 are determined taking into account the tolerance of mechanical processing of the bore 6, as well as the tolerance of mechanical processing of the tube 2. Anyway, there is a relation expressed by D dl between the inside diameter D of the bore 6 and the outside diameter dl of the tube 2, so that there is a gap 3 between the outer peripheral surface of the tube 2 and the inner peripheral surface of the bore 6. The size C of the gap 3 is expressed by D d 2. Owing to the presence of this gap 3, a considerably large part of the welding heat is supplied to the tube 2, while only a small part of heat is transferred from the tube 2 to the tube plate 1.In consequence, the weld bead 4 often has such a form as having a large depth of penetration in the tube 2 and an Insufficient penetratIon depth in the tube plate 1, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the presence of the gap sometimes causes misalignment of axes of the tube receiving bore 6 and the tube 2. Namely, it is often experienced that the axis of the tube 2 is offset from the axis of the tube receiving bore 6 to form a non uniformity of size of the gap 3 in the circumferential direction. In consequence, an uneven heat input distribution to the tube 2 and the tube plate 1 is caused in the circumferential direction durina welding, resulting in an irregular bead in the circumferential direction.In the event where the penetration depth in the tube 2 is large, the tendency of flowing of the bead to the inner side is increased. Furthermore, the heat input to the tube 2 is increased to cause an excessive penetration in the tube 2 to unacceptably degrade the quality of the welding.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Under these circumstances, the present invention aims at providing a method of welding a tube to a tube plate in which the input heat is suitably shared by the tube and the tube plate to ensure a good form of weld bead, thereby to overcome the abovedescribed problems of the prior art. To this end, according to the invention, there is provided a partly inserted type tube tube plate welding method, wherein the improvement comprises the steps of expanding, after partly inserting the tube end into the tube receiving bore formed in the tube plate, the portion of the tube end received by the bore to make the outer peripheral surface of the tube closely contact with the inner peripheral surface of the bore, and then welding the tube end to the tube plate. The above and other objects, as well as advantageous features of the invention will become clear from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A welding method of the invention will be described hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings. According to the invention, as in the case of the conventional method explained before in connection with Fig. 1, the tube receiving bore 6 formed in the tube plate 1 has an inside diameter D which is selected to be greater than the outside diameter dl of the tube 2, to make it possible to insert the tube 2 into the bore 6. The end portion of the tube 2 is inserted partly into the bore 6 of the tube plate 1. The tube end is then expanded over a length ss See Fig. 3 slightly greater than the insertion depth a, to make the outer peripheral surface of the tube 2 closely contact with the inner peripheral surface of the bore 6.The insertion depth a is selected to be almost equal to the wall thickness of the tube, taking into consideration the heat mass balance between the inner end portion of the inserted tube to be molten and the portion of the wall of the tube receiving bore to be molten during the welding. An insertion death greater than the abovestated depth is not preferred because such an insertion depth causes a tendency that the innermost portion of the tube is left unmelted. To the contrary, an insertion depth smaller than the above stated depth causes a too rapid melting of the innermost portion of the tube end while leaving the wall of the tube receiving bore not sufficIently molten, resulting in an imperfect welding. The expansion of the tube end can be performed in various ways, that is, mechanical tube expansion using a tapered mandrel and rolls or fluidic tube expansion by means of fluid pressure can be employed.The end portion of the tube.2 after the expansion has an outside diameter d which is substantially equal to the inside diameter D of the tube receiving bore 6, so that the gap 3, which is preserved during welding by the conventional method, is eliminated completely.Thereafter, a welding torch 5 is inserted and set in the tube receiving bore 6 as in the conventional method illustrated in Fig. 2, and is rotated by means of an automatic welder not shown to effect the welding. According to the invention, since the tube end is expanded into close contact with the wall of the tube receiving bore before the welding, the welding input heat is suitably shared by the tube and the tube plate so that the excessive penetration which according to the prior arts inevitabffi r takes place in the tube is fairly avoided while effecting an appropriate penetration in the tube plate, to ensure a remarkably improved quality of weld bead 7. The shape of weld bead is uniform in the circumferential direction so that the flowing of the welding metal to the inner side of the tube, which Is often caused hitherto due to non un form circumferent ai distribut on of the gap between the tube 2 and the tube plate 1. is completely avoided. By way of example, a test welding was conducted by the welding method of the invention, with an austenitic stainless steel pipe of 2107 mm dia. and 1.2 mm thick and a tube plate made of the same material as the tube. The welding was conducted by automatic TIG welding technic under a welding condi tion of a current of 70 to 90 A, voltage of 15 to 20 V and welding speed of 3 r.p.m., and a h gn quality of welding was obtained. As has been described, the welding method of the invention in which the tube end is expanded to closely contact with the wall of the tube receiving bore before the welding offers the following advantages. For instance, since the tube can be correctly and precisely located in relation to the tube receiving bore, the welding can be achieved while holding the tube concentrically with the tube receiving bore and at an adequate insertion depth into the tube receiving bore, so that the circumferential distribution of input heat is uniformalized. At the same time, the input heat is adequately shared by the tube and the tube plate because the outer surface of the tube is kept in close contact with the inner surface of the bore in the tube plate during the welding. For these reasons, the weld nag is achieved to have a good form of the weld bead. Furthermore, the elimination of the gap between the tube end and the wall of the tube receiving bore effectively prevents the flowing of welding metal to the inside of the tube to ensure a good shape of weld bead,
