# Soft contact lens analyzer.

## Abstract
A soft contact lens measuring device comprises a cylin drical lens support 10 defining a cavity 12 and pedestal 16 for immersing a soft contact lens in a saline solution. A piston 40 engages the support and can be operated by the user to force air in controlled amounts through a narrow passageway 22 extending up through the pedestal 16 to the saline solu tion. A bubble forms and rises until it is trapped by the lens. The interface between the bubble and the lens makes a convenient surface for focussing a radiuscope to allow lens dimensions to be determined.
