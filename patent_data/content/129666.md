# Preparation of a pharmaceutically active pyridazine derivative.

## Abstract
A novel method of preparing ethyl 6 ethyl 2 hydroxy propyl amino 3 pyridazinyl hydrazinecarboxylate is dis closed, wherein 7 chloro 3 methyl 4 oxo 4H pyridazino 6, 1 c 1,2,4 triazine is treated with ethyl 2 hydroxypropyl amine. The corresponding amino derivative is hydrolized in mild conditions and the hydrazino compound thus obtained is suitably acylated.
