## Description
DURABLE SILICONE EMULSION POLISH Patent Application of Edward Thomas Simoneau, Raymond Joseph Thimineur and Frank John Traver BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to silicone emulsion polishes.More particularly, it relates to silicone emulsion polishes and dressings which form detergent resistant, protective, glossy coatings on substrates to which they are applied. Silicone emulsion polishes and dressings, commonly used to improve the appearance of and to protect household products, luggage, fabrics, marine and auto vinyl, sporting goods, etc., are favored for their glossiness and ease of application however, they lack durability, especially after detergent washing, and must be frequently reapplied. Aminofunctional silicone emulsion polishes exhibiting detergent resistance are shown in U.S. Patents 3,960,575 Martin , 4,246,029 Sanders, Jar. , and 4,247,330 Sanders, Jr. which patents are hereby incorporated by reference , but improved protection of common substrates such as vinyl, improved storage life, and easier application are still desired. It has now been discovered that aminofunctional silicone polymer emulsions containing blends of polydimethylsiloxane oils, glycerin, or ultraviolet radiation absorbers show significant improvement in glossiness, ease of application, sheif life and resistance to surface degradation from exposure to sunlight. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an aminofunctional emulsion polish which is easy to apply, detergent resistant, and imparts good gloss to substrates to which it is applied. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a silicone emulsion polish which is shelf stable. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a silicone emulsion polish which protects the surface to which it is applied from degradation from exposure to sunlight. These and other objects are provided herein by an aminofunctional silicone emulsion comprising an aqueous emulsion of a an aminofunctional silane terminated diorganopolysiloxane of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R and R are, independently, monovalent hydrocarbon radicals of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, T is hydroxyl or a terminal aminofunctional group derived from the hydrolysis and condensation of such a hydroxyl group and a silane of the formula RO 3SiR Y , wherein each R is a monovalent a hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, R is a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from 3 to 5 carbon atoms and having a valence of a 1, a is an integer equal to 1, 2 or 3, and Y is a monovalent radical attached to RU by a carbon nitrogen bond and composed of hydrogen atoms, nitrogen atoms and up to 8 carbon atoms and containing at least one amine group, the ratio of carbon atoms to nitrogen atoms in Y being less than about 6 1 b an emulsifier or combination of emulsifiers and c at least one member selected from the group consisting of i a polydimethylsiloxane oil, or a blend of polydimethylsiloxane oils, having a viscosity of about 50 to 60,000 cstk., ii an amount of glycerin effec tive to enhance the shelf stability of said composition, and iii an ultraviolet radiation absorb ing compound. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The aminofunctional silicone emulsions of the present invention are prepared by combining an aminofunctional silane endstopped diorganopolysiloxane fluid, emulsifier s , water, and a modifier selected from polydimethylsiloxane oils, glycerin and ultraviolet radiation absorbing compounds, and then blending or milling the combined ingredients to form stable silicone emulsions which are durable and easily applied to smooth surfaces or fabrics and which will exhibit improved coating characteristics, shelf life or protection of the underlying surfaces, depending on the modifier used. The silanol terminal or aminofunctional diorganopolysiloxanes employed in the present invention are typically prepared by acid or base catalyzed polymerization of cyclic polysiloxane monomers of the general formula RR SiO 3 9, in which the R and R groups may be, independently, hydrogen or a hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon group. For the purposes herein, the substituents will preferably be monovalent hydrocarbon groups of from 1 to 8 carbons, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, vinyl, allyl, and the like. Most preferred forR and R is methyl. Blending cyclic polysiloxane monomers, such as octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, and water in the presence of a hydrolysis catalyst, preferably KOR, and heating the mixture if necessary to begin polymerization, yields a silanol endstopped polysiloxane. The terminal hydroxyl group will undergo a condensation reaction with a subsequently added aminofunctional silane, for example 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and the like, to yield polymers with terminal aminofunctional silane groups. The aminofunctional silanes suitable for preparing the aminofunctional diorganopolysiloxane fluids described above have the general formula RO335iR Ya, in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from 3 to 5 carbon atoms and having a valence of a 1, where a is an integer from 1 to 3, inclusive, and Y is a monovalent radical attached to R by a carbon nitrogen bond and composed of hydrogen atoms, nitrogen atoms and up to 8 carbon atoms and containing at least one amine group, the ratio of carbon atoms to nitrogen atoms in Y being less than about 6 1. Examples of silanes included in the above formula are discussed in U.S. 3,350,349 Hyde and U.S. 2,971,864 Speier , which are hereby incorporated by reference.Preferred diorganopolysiloxanes contemplated herein will have the general formula,EMI5.1 wherein R and R are, independently, monovalent hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, T is a silicon bonded hydroxyl terminal group or a monovalent aminofunctional terminal group derived via hydrolysis and condensation reaction such as described above between a terminal silanol group and an aminofunctional silane, producing an aminofunctional silane endstopped polymer, and wherein n is a positive integer sufficient to provide polymer fluids having a viscosity in the range of about 50 to 100,000 centipoise at 250C. Emulsification of the diorganopolysiloxanes is assisted by an emulsifying surfactant emulsifier which will promote dispersion of the diorganopolysiloxanes and other ingredients in an aqueous phase. Many suitable emulsifiers and combinations of emulsifiers will suggest themselves to persons skilled in the art from the discussion herein of the other ingredients, however, for the purposes of the present invention, alkylphenoxypolyoxyethylene glycol surfactants, such as octylphenoxypolyoxyethylene glycol e.g., TRITON X45, X100, X405 Rohm BR Haas , nonylphenoxypolyoxyethylene glycol Igepal CC850 GAF , and the like, and complex quaternary ammonium salts, such as methylpolyoxyethylene 15 cocoammonium chloride 5 , Ethoquad C 25 Armak and dimethylsoyaammonium chloride 74 , Arquado 2S 75 Armak , are preferred.Emulsifiers generating free acid are to be avoided as they tend to neutralize the amine function of the diorganopolysiloxanes. Combinations of emulsifiers may also be used. The modifying agents contemplated herein include silicone oils, glycerin, and ultraviolet radiation absorbing compounds, each of which has been discovered to give the compositions of the present invention improved properties. The silicone oils employed in the present invention are trimethyl endstopped polydimethylsilicone fluids having a viscosity in the range of 50 to 60,000 cps at 250C.Adding the oils to the aminofunctional polysiloxanes described previously improves the gloss and ease of application of emulsion polishes based on the present compositions. It has also been discovered that after aging about three days in the emulsion, the polydimethylsiloxane oils become fully incorporated into the structure of the diorganopolysiloxane emulsion. Thus the emulsion polishes of the present invention are able to retain their gloss longer after application and, with the detergent resistance imparted by the aminofunctional polysiloxanes, a high gloss coating can be retained through several washings without constant reapplication. It has been discovered herein that adding glycerin,C3H5 OH 3, improves the shelf life of the compositions described herein. Glycerin also serves to stabilize the emulsion, especially at low temperatures, giving the present emulsions superior freeze thaw properties. Stable emulsions according to the present invention have been observed after exposure to temperatures as low as 25 to 400C. The ultraviolet radiation absorbing compounds used in accordance with the present invention must be soluble in, and otherwise compatible with, the diorganopolysiloxane emulsions described previously. These include a class of substituted hydroxybenzophenones, such as 2 hydroxy 4methoxy benzophenone, 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone and 2,2 dihydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone. Particularly preferred compounds are silyl adducts of hydroxybenzophenone compounds, which have the general formula,EMI8.1 wherein X is H or OH, Z is H, OH, OQ or OW, where Q is CH, CH2 Si R3 OR4 Z W is CmH2m l, where y is equal 3 to 0, 1 or 2, z is equal to 1, 2 or 3, y z 3, R is alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R4is alkyl or alkanoyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, x is equal to 0, 1 or 2, and m is equal to 1 to 18, inclusive.A detailed description of such compounds is found in U.S. 4,374,674 Ashby et al. , incorporated herein by reference. 4 3 triethoxysilyl propoxy 2 hydroxybenzophenone is most preferred. The amounts of the modifying additives described herein will vary widely depending on the particular additive, and the exact combination of properties desired by the user. However, by way of illustration, in embodiments that contain the above described polydimethylsiloxane oils, amounts of up to about 85 weight percent, preferably about 20 to about 55 weight percent, are contemplated. In embodiments where glycerin is a component, amounts of glycerin from about 0.5 to 5 weight percent, preferably about 1 3 weight percent, based on the total composition are contemplated. Any amount of ultraviolet radiation screening compound effective to prevent degradation of the underlying substrate to which the present compositions are applied is contemplated. For the purposes of the present invention, amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent, based on the total compostion, are contemplated. The aminofunctional silicone emulsions of the present invention may be used as components in silicone emulsion polish compositions. Suitable polishes according to the present invention are typically prepared by combining an emulsion with, for example, an aqueous auto polish base which contains perfumes, odor masks, dispersants, suspending agents, cleaning abrasives, and the like. The final polish composition typically contains 1 60 percent by weight of the modified aminofunctional silicone emulsion of the present invention, the rest comprising polish base.Alternatively, the modified aminofunctional silicone emulsion may simply be cut to less than about 20 silicone solids by weight with water or any other of a number of vehicles familiar to persons skilled in this art. The polishes containing the presently described aminofunctional silicone emulsions may be easily applied to a wide range of solid substrates, including fabrics, painted surfaces, and all of the previousLy mentioned substrates, to give protective glossy finishes. In preparing the silicone emulsion polishes of the present invention, the exact formulation will depend on several factors including type of polysiloxane fluids used, the nature of the aminofunctionality, and the exact amount and type of modifier s employed. Simple experimentation to match the polish formulation to a given set of conditions is contemplated. The polish formulations may contain additional components to lend the polishes desirable characteristics without significantly affecting their performance as polishes. These include, for instance, thickeners, antifoaming agents, antibacterial agents, solvents, pigments, and the like. In order that persons skilled in this art may better understand the practice of this invention, the following examples are provided by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation. EXAMPLES 1 4 Four emulsions according to the present invention were prepared as follows Sample 1 1692 parts by weight pbw deionized water, 120 pbw octylphenoxypolyoxyethylene glycol emulsifier Tritons X405 Rohm Haas , 30 pbw methylpoly oxyethyiene 15 cocoammonivil chloride Ethoquaus C 25 ARMAK Company and 7.1 pbw KOH pellets were added to a stainless steel reaction vessel, then blended to form an aqueous solution. 1059 pbw of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane dimethyl tetramer were added and the mixture homogenized at 6000 psig to give 2400 pbw of a homogeneous emulsion. The emulsion was heated to 88 C for 6 hours to promote polymerization, then cooled to 550C. 1000 pbw of the emulsion were removed and mixed with a blend of 5 pbw octylphenoxypolyoxyethylene glycol Triton X100 Rohm Haas and 10 pbw of 4 3 triethoxysilyl proproxy 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone. Polymerization continued at 350C for a half hour, at which time a blend of 10 pbw 3 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxy silane and 2 pbw of Triton X100 were added. The emulsion was allowed to polymerize at 35CC for a half hour, when 2.5 pbw acetic acid were added to neutralize the KOH. The final emulsion had a light yellow cast. Sample 2 To an aminofunctional emulsion prepared as Sample 1, there was added additional acetic acid stoichiometrically a mol of acetic acid was added for each mol of 3 2aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxy silane previously incorporated, to yield the amine acid salt. The final emulsion was milky white and contained 36.18 total solids.Sample 3 Following the general procedure described forSample 1, an emulsion was preapred using 1050 pbw of dimethyl tetramer, 190 pbw Trimethylcocoammonium chloride 50 Active emulsifier Arquade C 50 ARMAK Company , 1692 pbw water, 6.8 pbw KOH pellets and 45 pbw Tritons X405. 2400 pbw of the homogenized solution were heated for 6 hours at 650C to polymerize, then cooled to 550C. 1000 pbw of the emulsion were mixed with a blend of 5 pbw Tritone X100 and 10 pbw of the silylated hydroxybenzophenone W screen used in Sample 1. Polymerization was continued at 550C for a half hour. A blend containing 10 pbw of 3 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxy silane and 2 pbw Tritone X100 was added and polymerized an additional half hour at 550C. KOH was neutralized with 2.4 pbw acetic acid. The final emulsion had a deep yellow cast. Sample 4 A stoichiometric amount of acetic acid was added to the Sample 3 emulsion so that the amine acid salt was formed in half the available amine. The resultant emulsion was off white and contained about 34.6 total solids. Polish formulations were prepared by blending the aminofunctional emulsions by cutting the silicone solids content to about 10 20 with added water and adding additional emulsifier Tritone X100 . The polish formulations were applied to painted substrates and cured to a film exhibiting good gloss, good detergent resistance, and low migration. The integral UV absorber remained in the cured film. EXAMPLES 5 9 Five emulsions according to the present invention were prepared as follows Sample 5 315 parts by weight pbw of a 3 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxy silane stopped polydimethyls iloxane fluid, 375 pbw of a 1000 cstk. polydimethylsiloxane oil and 810 pbw of a 100 cstk. polydimethylsiloxane oil were added to a stainless steel breaker and the blend warmed to 43 C. An emulsifier blend containing 9 pbw octylphenoxypolyoxyethylene glycol Triton X45 Rohm Haas , 94 pbw Triton X405, 38 pbw qlycerin, 8 pbw formalin, and 149 pbw deionized water was prepared and made uniform, then added slowly to the oil blend with agitation and while maintaining the temperature at 430C.The uniform mixture was then passed through a Manton Gaul in colloid mill 22 mil gap at 20 psig N2 pressure 1546 pbw of a paste were collected and disbursed in 605 pbw dionized water. The resultant emulsion solids measured at 150CC was 63.2 the viscosity was 1240 cps RVF Brookfield 3 spindle at 20 rpm . This emulsion contained 38 emulsifier solids and 1.5 glycerin.Sample 6 An emulsion was prepared as in Sample 5, except 315 pbw of the aminofunctional polysiloxane, 375 pbw of the 1000 cstk. polysiloxane oil, 810 cps of the 100 cstk.oil 13.5 pbw of Tritone X45, 142 pbw of Tritons X405, 138 pbw water and 5 pbw formalin, were used to prepare the paste.1545 pbw of paste were disbursed in 700 pbw water and the solution milled at 350C at 30 psig using a 25 mil gap.Solids were 60.2 and the viscosity was 2450 cps.Sample 7A E To portions of the Sample 6 emulsion was added, individually, 1 Sample 7A , 2 Sample 7B , 3 Sample 7C , 4 Sample 7D and 5 Sample 7E of glycerin, which was then disbursed by shaking.Sample 8 An emulsion was prepared exactly as in Sample 5, except only 2.5 emulsifier solids 0.23 Tritone X45 and 2.36 Tritons X405 and 2 glycerin were utilized. The solution was held at 430C for 3 hours prior to colloid milling at 20 psig with 13 mil gap. 1555 pbw paste were disbursed in 630 pbw water to yield an emulsion having 62 total solids and a viscosity of 1150 cps. Sample 9 Following the procedure of Sample 5, an emulsion was prepared containing 12.6 of the aminofunctional polysiloxane fluid, 15 of the 1000 cstk. polysiloxane oil, 32.4 of the 100 cstk. oil, 3 glycerin and 2.5 emulsifier solids. 1588 parts by weight of paste were collected in 630 parts by weight water and milled at 18 psig at 430C with a 12 mil gap to yield a 1010 cps emulsion having 63.7 total solids. Polish formulations were prepared from Samples 5,6,8 and 9 with an industrial aqueous auto polish base containing perfume, odor masks, dispersants, suspending agents and polishing abrasives. With 6.5 parts by weight of each of Samples 5,6,8 and 9 were combined 93.5 parts by weight of the polish base. The polish formulations were applied to painted surfaces and all coatings exhibited good gloss, covered blemishes well and showed good resistance to 3 detergent washings. Samples prepared as Sample 6 but containing no 1000 cstk. polydimethylsiloxane oil also exhibited good polish properties but did not give as good a depth of gloss as the other samples containing a blend of polysiloxane oils. In freeze thaw testing, it was found that emulsionSample 5 9 containing less than 2 glycerin would separate and break after exposure to 450C for 16 hours followed by thawing one cycle . However, all the samples containing glycerin were stable through 16 hours freeze at 120C and 64 hours thawing. Sample 6 no glycerin failed the 120C test, splitting out free oil as it thawed Samples 5 and 8 passed 3 cycles at 120C. Polish formulations prepared as above from Samples 5 9 using the auto polish base containing glycerin passed freeze thaw testing of 120C for 16 hours and 250C for 8 hours, retaining good texture and appearance.Polish containing no glycerin appeared to coagulate, split out free oil, thicken and lose its good texture appearance quality, making its unsuitable as a polish. Many variations in the foregoing embodiments are obviously possible in view of the present disclosure, however, all such incidental changes are within the intended scope of the following claims.
