# Shock absorbing device having predictable deflection characteristics.

## Abstract
A lightweight shock absorbing device which could be used on automotive vehicles includes an elongated main body portion and side return portions connectable to opposite ends of the main body for extension a short distance along the side of the vehicle. The main body portion includes longitudinally extending corrugations which open both forwardly and rearwardly, forming locking channels 20a, 20b, 22a, 22b into which accessories 36 , stiffeners and mounting brackets 52 can be selectively connected to the body. Reinforcement stiffeners can be attached to the body at any desired location along the length of the body to establish desired shock absorbing characteristics dependent upon the weight and size of the vehicle on which the bumper is mounted.
