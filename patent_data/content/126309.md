# Process for recovering C4 hydrocarbons using a dephlegmator.

## Abstract
A process is described for separating C₄ hydrocar bons in high recovery and high purity from a feed gas comprising about 0 5 C₅ and heavier hydrocarbons, 1 10 C₄ hydrocarbons, 0 10 C₃ hydrocarbons, 0 10 C₂ hydrocarbons and the balance CH₄ and light inerts. Efficient separation is effected by using a dephlegmator cycle em ploying only internal refrigeration.
