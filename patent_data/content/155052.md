# Method of reducing artefacts in images formed by means of Fourier Zeugmatography.

## Abstract
NMR images formed by means of Fourier zeugmatography contain disturbing artefacts which are caused by coherent inter ference signals for example, offset signals, non ideal 180 reversing pulses . In accordance with the invention, alternating phase 90 excitation pulses are used in the successive mea surement cycles, the signal samples taken during the measure ment cycles being stored in the adjacently situated rows of an image frequency matrix. The values in every second row of the matrix are inverted, so that the contributions of the coherent interference signals change their sign in every row in the direction of the columns. During the Fourier transformation of the columns, therefore the artefacts caused by the interference signals are shifted towards the edge of the image.
