# Flexible, self supporting and biodegradable films and their production.

## Abstract
Film forming formulations comprising starch, ethylene acrylic acid copolymer, and optionally polyethylene, can be blown into film upon neutralization of a portion of the copo lymer acid functionality. The resultant biodegradable films have potential application as agricultural mulch, garbage bags and various types of packaging.
