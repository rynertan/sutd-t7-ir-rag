## Description
This invention relates to an amorphous silicon photoreceptor for electrophotography which causes no image blurring as defined hereinafter in use under a high humidity environment, a process for the preparation and or regeneration thereof, and a method of electrophotography using such a photoreceptor. Electrophotography is but one of several image forming methods, the principle of which was discovered by Carlson in 1983. Various improvements have been made on the technique and now electro photography is widely applied in the image recording arts for example in plain paper copiers PPC s , a laser printers, a facsimiles and the like see R.M. Schaffert, Electrophotogra phy , 1975, Focal Press Ltd. Generally, an electrophotographic method comprises several elementary processes. In PPCs, for example, the method usually comprises the following processes Photoreceptors which have hitherto been used for electrophotography include dispersions of fine CdS, ZnO or other powder coated with the binder of organic material, Se selenium photoreceptors containing As or Te coated by the vacuum evaporation method, organic photoconductor OPC materials such as polyvinylcarbazole and trinitrofluorene, and others. More recently, attention has been drawn to the semiconductive properties, especially photoconductivity of amorphous silicon hydride hereinafter referred to as a Si in the form of a film made by the plasma chemical vapor deposition P CVD from silane Si Photosensitive a Si films are made from raw materials consisting essentially of silane gas by plasma CVD, as mentioned above. Various proposals and improvements have been made on the items required as a photoreceptor, such as acceptance voltage, spectral sensitivity and photoreceptor life. For example, addition of diborane, ammonia, oxygen, hydrocarbon, germane Ge The a Si has the following excellent properties as compared with the aforementioned conventional photoreceptors For making best use of such advantageous properties, attempts have been made to apply the a Si photoreceptors to high speed PPCs, laser printers, facsimiles, etc., as high performance photoreceptors for electrophotohgraphy. However, the following problems have been pointed out. Since a Si photoreceptors had such chemical and thermal stability and high surface hardness as mentioned above, they were at first expected to exhibit both stable performance in use as photoreceptors under various environmental conditions and to endure a very large number of copying procedures. It was actually found, however, that a phenomenon could occur in which the copy image is blurred when electrophotographic copying procedures using such a Si photoreceptors were carried out under a high humidity condition, more specifically, under a relative humidity above 70 , and furthermore, no image could be obtained at all under higher humidity conditions this phenomenon is herein referred to as image blurring . This image blurring becomes more conspicuous as copying procedures are repeated. Usually, the image blurring occurs when the charging exposure development transfer process is repeated several thousand times in an ordinary PPC plain paper copier under a high humidity condition. However, the reversibility of this phenomenon has also been found that is, a clear image can be obtained if copying is again conducted under a low humidity after the image blurring has occurred under high humidity. It may be considered that such image blurring can be prevented by continuously heating an a Si photoreceptor drum at the temperature of 40 50 C so that the relative humidity around the drum surface may always be maintained below about 50 even if the environmental humidity varies. In this case, however, an increased cost of the copying machine and its more complicated mechanism are unavoidable because of the incorporation of a heater into the drum and the provision of a temperature controller. Thus, the image blurring is characterized by The cause of the image blurring has not yet been completely elucidated. Such image blurring will not be a serious problem for conventional photoreceptors, for example, those utilizing Se photoreceptors. In their efforts at over coming this image blurring problem, the present inventors closely studied the above characteristics, especially the latter, and as a result of these studies, formulated the present invention. The present inventors found in the course of their experiments the following two facts which appeared to give a solution to the image blurring. I The primary cause of image blurring which become conspicuous with repeated copying procedures is the deterioration of the surface of photoreceptors due to corona charge. This fact was revealed in the course of the following experiments on each elementary process of electrophotography, i.e. corona charging, exposure, development or cleaning. A commercially available copying machine was so modified so that only one of the elementary processes, that is, a the initial corona charging and the alternating corona discharging, b the light irradiation, c the magnetic brush development, or d the cleaning, might be conducted separately, and each operation was repeated as many times as the number of operating procedures corresponding to that required to take 10,000 copies. Thereafter, a copying test was carried out at 30 C, 80 RH relative humidity to examine the occurrence of image blurring. The phenomena most often occurred with a Si photoreceptors which had been subjected to the repeated corona charge a alone. On the other hand, a commercially available Se photoreceptor was treated in the same manner by the repeated corona charge alone at 30 C, 80 RH. Similar image blurring was observed. Thus, although image blurring also occurs in conventional Se photoreceptors treated by corona charge alone, it may be supposed that the surface layer of the conventional materials, which have a relatively low surface hardness, is gradually scraped off in the course of the entire processes in PPC, in particular the development and cleaning processes and, therefore, a fresh surface condition may always be maintained. On the contrary, a Si photoreceptors have extremely high surface hardness. Accordingly, it may be supposed that when a deteriorated surface layer is produced by corona charge, the deteriorated layer is not thoroughly removed even through the magnetic brush development and or cleaning process, but rather such a layer will be accumulated as copying procedures are repeated. This is apparently the reason why such image blurring, which is not significant with conventional photoreceptors, causes a serious problem in the electrophotography using a Si material. II As described in our copending Japanese Patent Application No. 228252 84, ESCA The present inventors have discovered that the problem of image blurring in a Si photoreceptors can be solved by either improving one or more steps in the electrophotographic and or by adding one or more additional steps to the conventional electrophotographic processes, each method being used to effect gradual removal i.e. polishing of the surface of the a Si photoreceptors. The present inventors thus propose the following three methods as means for obtaining the desired improvements in a Si electrophotography Such means have already been proposed concep tionally in the conventional electrophotography and in part disclosed in patents. For example, the use of common hard abrasive substances such as CeO₂, BaTiO₃, SiC and Al₂O₃ as an external additive for a developer has been attempted. It has also been proposed that a cleaning blade may be made of a material having a higher surface hardness than a Si. According to the investigations by the present inventors, however, it has been found that conventional, hard abrasive polishing of the surface cannot give any satisfactory solution to the image blurring if removal of the deteriorated surface layer of a Si materials is attemp ted. The present inventors have discovered that in order to obtain the desired polishing effect in a Si photoreceptors, a novel abrasive, having a surface hardness lower than that of a Si and being a solid phase reactive therewith, must be used. According to the invention, there is provided an amorphous silicon photoreceptor for electrophotography which has at least one of the following properties There is also provided a process for preparing and or regenerating an amorphous silicon photoreceptor for electrophotography, which is characterized by mechanically removing at least a part of a solid phase reaction product produced by using an abrasive substance capable of inducing a solid phase reaction with the photoreceptor for electrophoto graphy into contact with the surface of said photorecep tor. Further, there is provided an improved method for electrophotography which is characterized by using a de veloper containing at least one soft abrasive additive selected from carbonates and sulfates of alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and transition metals, triiron tetraoxide, and mineral clays having a layer structure. This invention also provides an improved method for electrophotography which is characterized by further comprising a step of polishing the surface of an a Si photoreceptor on which an image is formed by using at least one soft abrasive substance selected from carbo nates and sulfates of alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and transition metals, triiron tetraoxide, and mineral clays having a layer structure. The invention further provides an improved method for electrophotography which is characterized by further comprising a step of contacting, preferably intermittently, an amorphous silicon photoreceptor with a cleaning member containing as a soft abrasive at least one substance selected from carbonates and sulfates of alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and transition metals, triiron tetraoxide, and mineral clays having a layer structure. Figs. 1 and 2 show an example of the polishing apparatuses used in the invention, wherein a photoreceptor drum 1, a vessel 4 containing an abrasive, a cleaning roller 8, and a cleaning blade 9 are illustrated. The invention will hereinafter be described in more detail. The surface of a conventional a Si photoreceptor formed by plasma CVD usually has fine unevenness due to the preparation process and the base Al tube. The present inventors measured surface roughness of many a Si materials prepared by various processes by means of a needle type surface roughness tester Talystep manufactured by Rank Taylor Hobson Co., and found that the materials generally had the mean roughness along the center line of about 300 Å with the minimum being 210 Å. Further, we also measured the surface roughness by a coordinates measuring scanning electron microscope EMM 3000 and a section measuring apparatus PMS 1 , both of Elionix Co., and calculated the mean roughness along the center line and others as defined hereinafter. Thus, the following surface characterisitics of conventional a Si photoreceptors were found Methods considered by the present inventors for lowering the surface roughness of a Si photoreceptors include 1 the surface of the photoreceptor is polished after the production thereof 2 the processes and conditions for forming films are improved and 3 the surface roughness of a base Al tube is reduced. The inventors attempted to improve the surface roughness by the polishing method 1 described just above, and found that the image blurring under a high humidity can be prevented from occurring by polishing the surface of the a Si photoreceptor immediately after the production thereof by means of an abrasive capable of causing a solid phase reaction with the material, as will be described below. Thus, the surface of a Si photoreceptors was polished longitudinally with a certain width like a belt for various periods of time according to the polishing method 1 and photoreceptor drums having a polished part were subjected to a copying test. Image blurring occurred at the non polished part after approximately 10,000 copies were formed, whereas at the polished part good image qualities were obtained with no image blurring under a high humidity even after 500,000 runs. More detailed investigations of polishing conditions revealed that the effect of the polishing on the prevention of image blurring depended on the surface roughness of photoreceptors. Further, it was also found that the surface roughness of a polished photoreceptor could be controlled by the period of time for polishing if other polishing conditions such as pressure, etc., were not varied that is, the longer the polishing period is, the more reduced the lower the surface roughness is. The present inventors have discovered as a result of further investigations that a marked advantage can be obtained when the surface of a phtoreceptor has at least one of the following properties i to v . The surface having at least the property ii is particularly preferred. i The mean roughness along the center line as derived from measurements by a needle type surface roughness tester is 190 Å or less, preferably 150 Å or less, more preferably 120 Å or less. The mean roughness along the center line, R a , is defined by the following equation In the present invention the mean roughness along the center line is represented by the mean of ten values of R a calculated by the above equation from the values measured at any ten positions on a photoreceptor. The measurement is carried out by a needle type surface roughness tester Talystep manufactured by Rank Taylor Hobson Co. under the following conditions needle load 4 mg, stylus 0.1 x 2.5 µm, lateral magnification 1,250 times, longitudinal magnification 100,000 times, filter cut off frequency 0.33 Hz, measuring speed 0.0025 mm sec, and length to be measured 30 80 µm. ii The mean surface roughness along the center line as derived from measurements by a coordinates measuring scanning electron microscope and a section measuring apparatus is 60 Å or less, preferably 40 Å or less, more preferably 30 Å or less. The mean roughness along the center line, R a , is defined by the following equation 1 Low frequency components are eliminated from the found values in the following manner. A data set consisting of 256 values, i.e. values measured at from the first data point to the 256th point of the 300 points, is taken. This corresponds to 10.24 µm of the measured length. These 256 values are expressed as Y R a is calculated according to the above definitions. Taking into consideration possible random sampling, 10 sets of measured data are taken and the mean value of the sets is designated as the mean roughness along the center line in the present invention. iii The variance of mean roughnesses along the center line as derived from measurements by a coordinates measuring scanning electron microscope and a section measuring apparatus is 70 Å or less, preferably 50 Å or less, more preferably 40 Å or less. The variance, R The method for the measurement and the manner for obtaining the set of data by eliminating low frequency components from the measured data are the same as described for ii above. Thus, R iv The maximum amplitude as derived from measurements by a coordinates measuring scanning electron microscope and a section measuring apparatus is 450 Å or less, preferably 350 Å or less, more preferably 250 Å or less. The maximum amplitude R t is defined as the largest peak valley of actual data values from which the low frequency components have been eliminated. The method for obtaining the measured data and the manner for deriving the set of data by eliminating low frequency components from the measured data are the same as described for ii above. Thus, R t is calculated from the measured data according to the above definitions. Taking into consideration possible random sampling, 10 sets of measured data are taken and the mean value of the sets is designated as the maximum amplitude in the invention. v The difference between the mean of five largest values and the mean of five smallest values of the surface roughness as measured by a coordinates measuring scanning electron microscope and a section measuring apparatus is 420 Å or less, preferably 300 Å or less, more preferably 250 Å or less. The difference, R The method for obtaining the measured data and the manner for deriving the set of data by eliminating low frequency components from the measured data are the same as described for ii above. Thus, R The amorphous silicon hydride a Si photoreceptors of the present invention, can be obtained by contacting, the surface of a conventional a Si photoreceptor i.e., one whose surface does not have any of the above des cribed properties with a soft abrasive selected from the group consisting of carbonates and sulfates of alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and transition metals, iron oxide, especially triiron tetraoxide Fe₃O₄ , and mineral clays having a layer structure, which can participate in a solid phase reaction with the surface material of the photoreceptor, and mechani cally removing at least a part of the reaction product formed by the solid phase reaction of the surface material with the abrasive. This process according to the invention can be applied not only to such a new photoreceptor immediately after being produced but also to the regeneration of a photoreceptor which has caused image blurring. The substance, i.e. abrasive, capable of participating a solid phase reaction with the photoreceptor surface, which may be used in the invention is selected from group consisting of carbonates and sulfates of alkaline earth metals such as Ba, Mg, Ca, etc., rare earth metals such as Ce, Y, La, Eu, etc., and other transition metals such as Fe, Ti, Zr, etc., triiton tetra oxide, and mineral clays having a layer structure such as kaoli nite, montmorillonite, etc. Carbonates of alkaline earth metals or rare earth metals are especially preferred. These substances can effectively prevent the image blurring in the electrophotography using a Si photoreceptors by any of the methods which are above mentioned and will hereinafter be described in more detail. The abrasives used in the invention are referred to herein as soft abrasives because they have a relatively low hardness when compared to conventional hard abrasives e.g., CeO₂, BaO₃, SiC, Al₂O₃, and the like and are unusual in that they have a hardness less than the substance being polished, a Si. In this respect, the present process is quite distinct from conventional processes utilizing an abrasive with hardness higher than that of a material to be polished. It has not been elucidated why the above mentioned carbonates etc. are particu lary effective for the removal of the deteriorated layer on an a Si photoreceptor. Some embodiments of the process according to the invention will hereinbelow be described. A The abrasive according to this invention may be utilized as an external additive for a developer. Generally, the larger the amount of an abrasive used, the more effective the polishing is. However, the use of too large an amount of an abrasive, as part of a developer together with a toner, may directly affect the quality of the developed and trans ferred image on a paper and usually causes deterioration of image quality. According to the present invention, therefore, the weight ratio of the abrasive to the toner in the developer is suitably limited within the range of 0.01 to 5 by weigtht, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 by weight. The abrasive is preferably used in the form of powder. The abrasive of the invention preferably has a particle size smaller than that of the toner used therewith, usually approximately 10 µ, in order that no deterioration of image quality might be caused, although the particle size of the abrasive, which has a relatively low hardness, is gradually reduced by repeated operations such as mixing with a developer, contact with a photoreceptor, and the like. The abrasive used as an external additive in the present invention may be supplied into a developer together with a toner after being mixed therewith, or it can be supplied alone into a developer. B The abrasive according to this invention may be utilized in an additional process other than the development process. As stated above, the addition of an abrasive to a developer may be accompanied by the deterioration of image quality. In such a case, it is desirable to provide an independent process for polishing the surface of an a Si photoreceptor. Further, such an additional process may be used together with the addition of an abrasive additive to the developer. More specifically, such an additional process adventageously involves the use of a jig, or a like member useful for contacting the abrasive according to this inven tion with the surface of the a Si photoreceptor drum uniformly along the axial longitudinal direction, a means for supplying the abrasive to both the jig and the drum surface, and a means for preventing scattering of the abrasive in the copying machine. For example, a magnetic brush developing unit containing the abrasive but no toner may be provided independently of the developing process. In an another construction, a blade like jig is pressed on the surface of the a Si photoreceptor by a spring or other means under an appropriate pressure of from about 10 to 1,000 g cm², so that the abrasive of the present invention may be interposed between the jig and the photoreceptor. This additional process may preferably be carried out after the transfer process but before the corona re charging process in the electrophotography. More preferably, this process may be incorporated with the cleaning process which will be here inafter described in detail, since a simple construction of the whole apparatus can thus be attained. An embodiment of this invention where a polishing machine is used to contact the surface of a photoreceptor with the abrasive will be described hereinbelow. Any polishing machine which can polish the surface of a cylindrical drum may be used in the present invention. A machine in which the drum is continuously contacted with the abrasive while the surface thereof is polished by a pad as shown in Fig. 1 is preferably utilized. In Fig. 1, a polishing machine is shown which comprises a photoreceptor drum 1, a bearing 2 for fixing the drum in position, a pulley 3 for transmitting the rotation from a motor to a shaft of the drum, a container 4 for retaining the abrasive at all times, a means 5 for holding a pad and moving it in the axial longitudinal direction of the photoreceptor drum at a constant speed, a jig 6 attached to the means 5 and fixing the pad for polishing the surface of the photoreceptor drum, and a speed controllable motor 7. The pad may be of any type, but preferably it should be soft not to scratch the drum. Most preferably, it is a soft cloth or non woven fabric. The shape of the pad to be contacted with the circular surface of the photoreceptor drum is preferably a circular arc concentric to the transversally sectional circle of the drum, said arc corresponding to a central angle of the circle of at least 10 degrees, in order to avoid any linear contact of the pad with the surface. The size of the container 4 is preferably slightly larger than that of the photoreceptor drum. But a too large size is not preferred since the amount of the abrasive to be fed will increase largely. The container 4 may not always be necessary in certain polishing conditions. For instance, if a pad fixed on the jig 6 is initially impregnated with an abrasive, the abrasive can be evenly and thinly distributed all over the photoreceptor surface by rotating the drum while moving the pad along the means 5. The drum may usually be rotated at a speed of from 10 to 200 r.p.m., but a speed of from 20 to 50 r.p.m. is preferred. When the speed of rotation is in the range of from 20 to 50 r.p.m., a period of time for polishing is usually from 5 to 30 minutes. If lower speeds of rotation are utilized, the polishing time will generally be prolonged. The tolerance for the construction of the polishing machine is desirably 10 µm or smaller. The particle size of the soft abrasive of the present invention, unlike ordinary hard abrasives, may be as large as several tens µm from about 10 to 30 µm or even greater, but preferably the particle size of the abrasive is 30 µm or less. Because the abrasive is softer than the a Si photoreceptor, the abrasive itself will be broken and its size will be reduced in the course of the polishing. For example, if a commercially available special grade BaCO₃ reagent is treated in a mortar to adjust its average particle size to approximately 30 µm and then polished at 25 r.p.m. for 10 minutes in the apparatus shown in Fig. 1, the average particle size will be approximately 5 µm. The fracture section of the broken abrasive is chemically active and a solid phase reaction may readily occur under the high pressure of several Kbar exerted at the contact point between the abrasive and the surface of the photorecep tor. Thus, unlike when using ordinary hard abrasives, it is not necessary in the method of the present invention to strict ly control the particle size distribution and the average par ticle diameter of the abrasive. The desired effect of the invention can also be achieved by using a cleaning member comprising the abrasive according to the invention as a consituent. More specifically, the abrasive may be solidified and shaped into any form of members fur use in the cleaning process, for example, a cleaning blade, a cleaning roll, a cleaning brush, etc., by employing a suitable means, e.g., by using an appropriate binder e.g., organic or other . Alternatively, the abrasive of this invention may be incor porated into a presently used cleaning blade or brush made of a resin. The current compounding techniques in the plastics art may enable a person with ordinary skill to prepare a composite material having the content of the abrasive of about 30 by volume or more. Such a technique enables the preparation of a resinous cleaning blade, brush, roll, sponge or other member which contains the abrasive of this invention. When such a cleaning member comprising the abrasive as a constituent is contacted with the a Si photoreceptor drum, it is sufficient for the purpose of the invention to contact the member with the drum intermittently, rather than constantly. For example, the ratio of the period of time for contacting the member with the drum to that for rotating the drum is selected from the range of 1 5 to 1 500, preferably 1 50 to 1 10. In order to investigate the effect of such members on the prevention of image blurring, the surface of an a Si photoreceptor which had caused an image blurring after numbers of copying procedures was polished with a cleaning member containing SmCO₃ or BaCO₃ as the abrasive, and thereafter the photoreceptor was again subjected to copying procedures under a high humidity condition 85 , 30 C . It was found that the image blurring was effectively prevented at the polished part in contrast with non treated parts, and that the preventive effect could last during about 1,000 runs of copying. Further, when the surface polishing was conducted intermittently every 1,000 runs, the polished part could give a good image quality without any image blurring under a high humidity condition even after 80,000 runs. It was also found that when a non treated part where an image blurring had been caused in the course of 80,000 runs was polished with the above abrasive, containing cleaning member, a good image quality could be obtained without any image blurring under a high humidity condition. This means that an a Si photoreceptor which has caused any image blurring can be regenerated by polishing the photoreceptor with the abrasive of the present invention. Consequently, it has been found that in an electrophotographic copying machine using the a Si photoreceptor of the invention, any image blurring can be prevented from occurring by intermittently polishing the photoreceptor with the abrasive approximately every 1,000 runs. These cleaning members, such as cleaning blade, cleaning brush, cleaning roll, cleaning sponge, etc., may be used in the conventional cleaning process, hereinafter referred to as first cleaning process. However, it is more effective that an additional cleaning process, hereinafter referred to as second cleaning process, is provided after the first cleaning process and the cleaning members are used in the second process. In this case, any conventional cleaning member may be utilized as the member for the first cleaning process. Thus, a sufficient polishing effect can be attained merely by intermittently contacting the photoreceptor drum with the cleaning member containing the abrasive of the invention for example, at a rate of several tens times of contact per several thousands runs of copying in the second cleaning process. As compared with the constant contact, such an intermittently contacting method is more economically advantageous that is, the present method enables an appreciable reduction of defects of the former method, such as deterioration due to toner contamination, wear, etc., of the cleaning member, thus realizing a drastic prolongation of the life of the member. The most simple method of effecting the intermittent contact of the cleaning member with the photoreceptor drum is one in which the member is manually contacted with and slided on the drum. Automatic intermittent contact methods using an electromagnetic or electric driving means include the cleaning blade method in which the blade and the pad are intermittently pressed on the drum, and the cleaning roller method. The roller used in the cleaning roller method may be a foamed or unfoamed resinous rod like member impregnated with the abrasive. Further, it is also effective to form grooves or the like on the rod. Such a cleaning roller is contacted with the surface of the moving drum while being pressed thereon by an appropriate pressure of from about 1 g cm² to 10 kg cm². The contact of the drum and the cleaning member is preferably performed under friction, although the roller may be allowed to rotate freely. Thus, it is recommended to provide a suitable brake on the roller shaft so as to produce a difference between the circumferential speed of the roller and the circumferential speed of the moving drum. More preferably, the roller is rotated in the opposite direction to the rotating direction of the moving drum. When the a Si photoreceptors disclosed herein are employed, it will be possibled to effect the electrophotography without occurrence of any image blurring under high humidity conditions. The present invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following examples which are intendend to aid in the understanding of the invention but which are not to be construed as limitation thereof. All percentages reported herein, unless otherwise specified are percent by volume. All temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius C . Two groups A and B of a Si photoreceptor drums prepared under the same conditions were polished for various periods of polishing time. For each period of time used, the drum surface was polished by a width of about 5 cm. The drums used were prepared in the following manner A cleaned cylindrical Al substrate of 120 mm in diameter and 340 mm in length having surface roughness of 0.1 S was placed in a reaction vessel. The substrate was baked under vacuum at or above 100 C for 30 minutes. The vessel was evacuated by an oil diffusion pump for 30 minutes to a vacuum of 2 x 10 ⁵ Torr. Then, the pump was changed by an oil rotary pump and the reaction gases were introduced into the vessel. The layer structure of the film formed and the conditions for the preparation thereof are as follows Photosensitive layer NH₃ SiH₄ 0.2 B₂H₆ SiH₄ 40 Vppm ppm by volume Substrate temperature 315 C Period of time for forming 25 µ film 150 minutes Plasma power source DC direct current Plasma current density 0.15 mA cm², Surface layer a SiO The abrasive used was barium carbonate. Each photoreceptor drum was set in the polishing apparatus shown in Fig. 1 and polished at a drum rotation speed of 20 r.p.m. while applying a load of 6 kg at the jig 6 in the figure. The group A of drums was subjected to the polishing procedure for 50 or 120 minutes, whereas the group B of drums was polished for 60, 300 or 480 minutes. After polishing, each drum was subjected to numbers of copying procedures using a commercially available copying machine, U Bix 3300 MR manufactured by KONISHIROKU PHOTO IND. CO., LTD., Japan, under normal humidity. Image blurring was checked every 10,000 runs of copying by subjecting the drum to copying procedures under a high humidity of 85 RH at 30 C. One run herein means a series of procedures for obtaining one copy under normal humidity. In the group A, an image blurring occurred at the non polished part already after 10,000 runs of copying and bagan to occur at the 50 minute polished part after 200,000 runs of copying. On the other hand, the 120 minute polished part gave a good image quality without causing any image blurring even after 500,000 runs of copying. In the group B, image blurring occurred at the non polished part after 10,000 runs and began to occur at the 60 minute polished part after 240,000 runs, while the 300 and 480 minute polished parts gave a good image quality without causing any image blurring even after 1,000,000 runs. A specimen of the non polished or polished part of each drum was taken and the surface roughness of each specimen was measured by the aforementioned method using Talystep . The results are shown in Table 1. A specimen of the non polished or polished part of each drum of Example 1 was taken and the surface roughness of each specimen was measured by the coordinates measuring scanning electron microscope EMM 3000 and the section measuring apparatus PMS 1 . R a , R a Si photoreceptor drums prepared the following conditions were polished while varying the period of polishing time and the abrasive. For each period of time and abrasive used, the drum surface was polished by a width of about 5 cm. The drums were prepared in the following manner A cleaned cylindrical Al substrate of 120 mm in diameter and 340 mm in length having a surface roughness of 0.2 S was placed in a reaction vessel. The substrate was baked under vacuum at or above 100 C for 30 minutes. The vessel was evacuated by an oil diffusion pump for 30 minutes to a vacuum of 2 x 10 ⁵ Torr. The pump was changed by an oil rotary pump and the reaction gases were introduced into the vessel to prepare a film having the following layer structure Photosensitive layer NH₃ SiH₄ 0.2 B₂H₆ SiH₄ 40 Vppm Substrate temperature 315 C Period of time for forming 25µ film 150 minutes Plasma power source DC Plasma current density 0.15 mA cm², Surface layer a SiO The abrasive used were barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, triiron tetraoxide, a polyester abrasive paper Surfin 000 manufactured by Fujimi Kenmazai K.K., Japan, silicon carbide, and zirconium oxide. Each photoreceptor drum was set in the polishing apparatus shown in Fig. 1 and polished with each abrasive at a drum rotation speed of 20 r.p.m. for 5 or 10 minutes. After polishing, each drum was subjected to numbers of copying procedures using a commercially available copying machine U Bix V2, KONISHIROKU PHOTO IND. CO., LTD., Japan, under normal humidity. Image blurring was checked every 5,000 runs of copying procedures by subjecting the drum to copying procedures under a high humidity condition of 85 at 30 C. The part treated with barium carbonate, calcium carbonate or triiron tetraoxide for 10 minutes gave an clear image without causing any image blurring even after 30,000 runs of copying. The part treated with each of said abrasives for 5 minutes caused a slight image blurring after 30,000 runs. At the part non treated or treated with Surfin 000 , silicon carbide or zirconium oxide, image blurring began to occur after 5,000 runs and extensively occurred after 10,000 runs of copying. An a Si photoreceptor drum similar to those used in Example 3 was set in a copying machine and subjected to 10,000 runs of copying procedures under normal humidity conditions. After having observed that image blurring certainly occurred under a high humidity condition of 85 at 30 C, the photoreceptor drum was placed in the polishing apparatus shown in Fig. 1 and a part of the drum surface of about 5 cm in width was polished with barium carbonate, silicon carbide, zirconium oxide or triiron tetraoxide at a drum rotation speed of 30 r.p.m. for 5 minutes. Immediately after the polishing, only the part treated with barium carbonate or triiron tetraoxide could give the originally good image quality which the drum gave initially with no occurrence of image blurring under a high humidity of 85 at 30 C. All other abrasives were not effective and image blurring was observed in all drums treated with such abrasives. The drum having the part treated with barium carbonate or triiron tetraoxide was then subjected to further 10,000 runs of copying procedures. Good image qualities could be obtained without causing any image blurring under high humidity conditions. An a Si photoreceptor drum was prepared in the following manner A cleaned cylindrical Al substrate of 120 mm in diameter and 340 mm in length was placed in a reaction vessel. The substrate was baked under vacuum at or above 100 C for 30 minutes. The vessel was evacuated by an oil diffusion pump for 30 minutes to a vacuum of 2 x 10 ⁵. The pump was changed by an oil rotary pump and the reaction gases were introduced into the vessel. A film having the following layer structure was prepared. Photosensitive layer NH₃ SiH₄ 0.2 B₂H₆ SiH₄ 40 Vppm Substrate temperature 315 C Period of time for forming 25µ film 150 minutes Plasma power source DC Plasma current density 0.15 mA cm², Surface layer a SiO The developer used was composed of 970 g of iron powder having a particle size in the range of 10 to 200µ as a carrier, 30 g of a conventionally used negatively charged toner, and 60 mg of barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, yttrium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, triiron tetraoxide, cerium carbonate, silicon carbide, silica, cerium oxide, or aluminum oxide as an external additive. The drum was subjected to numbers of copying procedures under normal humidity using each of the ten types of developers and UBIX V II, KONISHIROKU PHOTO IND. CO., LTD., Japan. Image blurring was checked every 5,000 runs of copying procedures by subjecting the drum to copying procedures under a high humidity condition of 85 at 30 C. When barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, yttrium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, cerium carbonate, or triiron tetraoxide was used as an external additive, no image blurring was observed under a high humidity condition of 85 at 30 C even after 30,000 runs of normal humidity copying procedures. On the other hand, when silicon carbide, silica, cerium oxide, or aluminum oxide was used as an external additive, image blurring began to occur under a high humidity of 85 at 30 C at the end of 5,000 runs of normal humidity copyiig and extensively occurred after 10,000 runs. When a developer free of external additive was used, an image blurring began to occur under a high humidity condition 85 , 30 C after about 5,000 runs of normal humidity copying and extensively occurred after 10,000 runs of copying. An a Si photoreceptor drum similar to those used in Example 5 was used for the following experiments. Nine types of 10 cm wide non woven fabrics were provided. Each fabric was impregnated with barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, triiron tetraoxide, lanthanum carbonate, cerium carbonate, silicon carbide, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide or diamond powder, respectively. Each of the non woven fabrics was fixed by a jig just behind the cleaning blade. A copying life test under normal humidity was carried out on the drum using a copying machine UBIX V II , KONISHIROKU PHOTO IND. CO., LTD., Japan and, every 5,000 runs of the copying procedures under normal conditions, image blurring was checked by subjecting the drum to copying procedure under a high humidity condition 30 C, 85 . No image blurring was caused at 30 C, 85 even after about 30,000 runs of normal humidity copying procedures when the drum was polished with barium carbonate, calcium carbonate , triiron tetraoxide , lanthanum carbonate or cerium carbonate containing non woven fabric. When the non woven fabric containing silicon carbide, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide or diamond powder, or the abrasive free non woven fabric was used, image blurring began to be observed after 5,000 runs and was extensively caused under a high humidity condition of 85 at 30 C after 10,000 runs of normal humidity copying procedures. An a Si photoreceptor drum was prepared under the following conditions A cleaned cylindrical Al substrate of 120 mm in diameter and 340 mm in length was set in a reaction vessel. The substrate was baked under vacuum at or above 100 C for 30 minutes. The vessel was evacuated by an oil diffusion pump for 30 minutes to a vacuum of 2 x 10 ⁵ Torr. The pump was replaced by an oil rotary pump and the reaction gases were introduced into the vessel. A film was prepared under the following conditions Photosensitive layer NH₃ SiH₄ 0.2 B₂H₆ SiH₄ 40 Vppm Substrate temperature 315 C Period of time for forming 25µ film 150 minutes Plasma power source DC Plasma current density 0.15 mA cm², Surface layer a SiO The developer used was composed of 970 g of amorphous iron powder having a particle size in the range of 10 to 200µ as a carrier and 30 g of a conventionally used negatively charged toner. The drum was subjected to numbers of normal humidity copying procedures using the developer and UBIX 3300 MR , KONISHIROKU PHOTO IND. CO., LTD., JAPAN, and image blurring was then checked by subjecting the drum to copying procedures under 85 humidity at 30 C. The following experiments were carried out in order to investigate the preventive effect of a cleaning member on image blurring. A cleaning member was prepared by impregnating a foamed sponge of urethane elastomer with a mixture of SiC, Al₂O₃, SmCO₃ or BaCO₃ and a binder. The same sponge containing no polishing powder was used as a blank. The surface of the a Si photoreceptor drum which had observed image blurring after 10,000 runs of normal humidity copying procedures was partially polished tens times lightly with hand by using each of the sponges. The thus polished drum was subjected to copying procedures under a high humidity condition to investigate image blurring. The part of the drum treated with the blank, or the sponge containing SiC or Al₂O₃ caused image blurring, while the sponge containing SmCO₃ or BaCO₃ gave a good preventive effect on image blurring the image quality was completely recovered by BaCO₃ . Further copying life tests showed that the preventive effect could last about 1,000 copying procedures under a high humidity condition by BaCO₃ and about hundreds procedures of copyinig by SmCO₃. Furthermore, the same part of the drum was polished with hand by BaCO₃ every 1,000 copying procedures. A good image quality without image blurring could be obtained even after 80,000 copying procedures under a high humidity condition. The following experiments were carried out using a Si photoreceptor drums similar to those used in Example 7 in order to investigate the preventive effect of a cleaning member on image blurring. A cleaning roller was prepared by impregnating a foamed urethane elastomer rod in the form of a roller with SiC, Al₂O₃, SmCO₃ or BaCO₃ powder mixed with a binder. The same rod containing no abrasive was used as a blank cleaning roller. The surface of the a Si photoreceptor drum which had caused image blurring after 10,000 runs of copying procedures was contacted with the cleaning roller and rotated about 50 times. The drum was then subjected to copying procedures under a high humidity condition to investigate image blurring. Image blurring was observed at the part of the drum polished with the blank, or the roller containing SiC or Al₂O₃. A good preventive effect on image blurring was obtained by SmCO₃ or BaCO₃ and BaCO₃ gave a complete recovery of the effect. Further copying life tests showed that the preventive effect on image blurring could last about 1,000 copying procedures by BaCO₃ and about hundreds copying procedures by SmCO₃. Considering these results, the cleaning roller impregnated with BaCO₃ was set in a copying machine, UBIX 3300 MR , KONISHIROKU PHOTO IND. CO., LTD., Japan. As shown in Fig. 2, the cleaning roller 8 was placed between a cleaning blade 9 and a corona charger 10. In the figure, a magnetic brush magroll 12, a transfer charger 13 and a discharge unit 14 are also shown. The roller 8 was pushed on the photoreceptor drum 1 intermittently 50 rotations of the roller per 1,000 copying procedures by using a solenoid coil 11. Consequently, a good image without image blurring could be obtained even after 1,000,000 copying procedures under a high humidity condition. The cleaning roller was only slighly soiled and could be reused in further copying procedures.
