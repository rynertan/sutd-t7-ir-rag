# Method for generation of a run length limited coded data stream.

## Abstract
The generation of non return to zero NRZ representa tions of runlength limited RLL encoded datastreams uti lizes a length oriented arithmetically recursive RLL encoder whose finite state encoding transition space has assigned RLL symbols to state transitions. By constraining the paths, and hence restricting the set of allowable RLL symbol streams, then selectable notch frequencies in the spectra of the NRZ representation can be secured. Recovery of data is obtained by the logical dual of this process. Also, a NRZ bit stream representation exhibits a frequency spectrum notch ed at f kn hertz if K NRZ source codestreams are k way inter leaved.
