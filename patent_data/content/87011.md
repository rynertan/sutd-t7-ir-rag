# Microcode control mechanism utilizing programmable microcode repeat counter.

## Abstract
The microcode control mechanism includes a sequence counter 18 for supplying a sequence of numbers, a programmable logic array 17 responsive to the processor instruction and to the sequence of numbers for producing a sequence of microwords needed to execute the instruction, a repeat circuitry 30, 31 responsive to a predetermined microword produced by the programmable logic array 17 for setting the sequence counter 18 back to a count which is less than the current count for causing a selected portion of the microword sequence to be repeated, and a programm able repeat counter 92 for counting the number of times the selected portion is repeated and for disabling the repeating action after a selected number of repeats.
