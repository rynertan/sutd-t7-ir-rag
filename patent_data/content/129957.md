# SHEAVE RETENTION APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
The sheave retention apparatus of the present invention includes a cap 34 that fits over the end 30 of an axle 12 to retain a sheave 10 thereon. A bolt 36 fastens the cap to the axle. Cap 34 is disk shaped with a shoulder 42 that fits over end 30 of axle 12 . When installed, bolt 36 passes through an off center hold 38 in the cap and into a corresponding off center nut 40 welded to the inner wall of the tubular axle. Rotation of cap 34 on axle 12 will bind the cap between the bolt and the axle to prevent unthreading of the bolt. Addition ally, to resist unthreading under vibrational influences, a lock ing plate 62 that is clamped between the hexagonal head 60 of the bolt and the outer surface of the cap. The locking plate has two notched corners 68 and 70 that contact a portion of the cap to prevent rotation of the locking plate with respect to the cap, and has two square corners 64 and 66 that are bent up against the wrench flats of the bolt to prevent the bolt from rotating with respect to the locking plate.
