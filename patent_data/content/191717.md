# Fusible plug safety device for venting aircraft tires.

## Abstract
A fusible thermally responsive device 20 for mounting in a bore 12 provided for it in a wheel 10 to vent an over pressure condition caused by heat generated in an aircraft wheel and brake assembly comprises a rod shaped length of a thermally activated virgin eutectic alloy 34 exhibiting a tolerance within 1 F of a specific melt temperature esta blished for the alloy, which rod shaped eutectic alloy in its virgin solid form has one end 34b machined to a self hold ing taper such as to be press fit into a mating bore 28, 48 having the same self holding taper 28b, 48b in a cylindrical carrier member 22, 42 . The carrier is mounted in the wheel bore, either from the inside 22 or the outside 42 of the wheel, and a pair of O ring type seals 32, 52, 62 provide a positive sealing relationship between the virgin eutectic 34 and the carrier 22, 42 and between the carrier 22, 42 and the wheel 10 .
