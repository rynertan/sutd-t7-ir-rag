# A method of fabricating dithiafulven geminal dithiolate compounds and their selenium analogs.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to novel heterofulvene geminal dithiolate compounds and their selenium and tellurium analogs having the general formula The novel method of preparing these compounds involves the reaction of a cis dicyanotetraheterofulvalene derivative with two equivalents of an organic sulfide, selenide or telluride compound, eventually followed by reacting the reaction product with two equivalents of an organic halogenide. The new compounds are key synthetic intermediates for the preparation of tetrathiafulvalene derivatives and tetraselenafulvalene derivatives which are useful in optical printing of conducting patterns, in electrochromic displays and in high resolution lithography.
