Group II avian adeno AA viruses are therefore economically important diseases of poultry and account for annual losses in the poultry industry of millions of doliars.On the basis ol an agar gel precipitin test there is no cross reaction between viruses in Groups I and II however, this is a rather insensitive test system, hence the possibiiity of some serological relationship among viruses in the to groups cannot definitely be disregarded. This invention relates to a successful procedure for the in vitro propagation of Group II AA ruses and to the application of this procedure to te product on of Group II At vaccines effective in the prevention of croup It AA related diseases. Description of or the Prior Art As reported by C.H. Domermuth et al., Vaccination for r.aemorrhagic Enteritis of Turkeys.Avian Diseases, 21 557 565, 1977 Vaccination ofRing Necked Pheasant for Marble Spleen Disease.Avian Diseases 23 30 38 1979 , and J. Thorsen et al, Field Trials of an Immunization ProcedureAgainst Haemorrhagic Enteritis of Turkeys AvianDiseases 26 473 477 , Haemorrhagic Enteritis ofTurkeys and Marble Spleen Disease of pheasants can be prevented by vaccination with avirulent strains of the virus. For convenience, the vaccine virus is usually administered orally to young birds in the rinking water, however, other routes of inoculation, such as aerosolization or intravenous or intramuscular injection may be suitable. Until recently, it was not possible to propagate Group II AAviruses in cell culture systems or in avian embryos. Because of this, vaccine virus had to be produced by infecting turkey poults, killing them a few days later, removing their spleens, and preparing crude homogenate of spleen tissue which contained sufficient virus to induce protection when fed to other birds. There are several disadvantages ansociated with this system of vaccine production. Firstly, it is cumbersome in that it requires a large number of disease frae birds raised in isolatior.. Secondly, contamination of the vaccine with extreous agents, such as Erysipelas species or other viruses, can also occur. Thirdly, it is difficult to standardize the potency of the vaccine because there is no simple method of determining the amount of virus in each batch. Finally, the vaccine is unstable because of the r r esence cf tissue enzymes and hence must be stored at 70 C. irocedures for purifying the virus from crude spleen homogenates have been reported, however, these techniques do not totally overcome the disadvantages outlined above. vagina et al., In Vitro Studies ofHaemorrhagic Enteritis Virus with ImmunofluorescentAntibody Technique. Avian Disease 26 150 157 1982 demonstrated the in vitro infection of chicken, turkey and pheasant cells with HEV, however all attempts to passage the virus in these avian cell cultures hav failed. Absent is a method for the continued in vitro progagation of the vaccine virus, and the use of spleen homogenates from infected birds for producing a vaccine has been the only method available for inducing immunity. Recently, Nazerian et al., Establishment of B Lymphoblastoid cell lines from Marek s Disease irus induced Tumors in Turkeys.International Journal of Cancer 29 63 68, 1982 LIu et al, Establishment of Lymphoblastoid CellLines from Marek s Disease Primary Tumors, PoultryScience 62 1902 1905 1983 have established lymphoblastoid cell lines from tumors of turkeys infected with Marek s Disease MD virus, an Herpes virus. Further, U.S. patent 4,388,298, Nazerian et al., describes the method of growing haemorrhagic enteritis virus HEV in a Lymphoblastoid cell lint of turkey origin designated MDTC RP 19. however, this is a transformed cell line which is also patently infected with Marek s Disease Virus. Hence, it may not be suitable for vaccine production. Perrin et al., Raemorrhagic Enteritis ofTurkeys Culture of Virus in Vitro, Bull. Acad. Vet. de France 54 231 235 1981 outlines a preliminary study in which a spleen cell culture system is utilized for the in vitro replication of HEV MSD virus. Thus, this experimentation by Perrin et al.suggests that HEV MSD virus replicates in a cell system which consists mostly of white blood cells, however, their results appear to be inconclusive. In addition, this work fails to establish the possible effects of several passages in vitro and makes no attempt to incorporate the virus into vaccine. Hence, previous attempts to culture GroupI avian adeno AA virus, have except for the case of Nazerian mentioned above, been unsuccessful.There may be several explanations for this.Seiection of the appropriate cell types which are susceptible to infectIon b Group II AA viruses is critical to the ultimate success in the propagation of these viruses in vitro. In previous experimentation for example, chicken and turkey fibroblast cultures or chicken and turkey kidney fibroblast cultures were utilized. These cultures did not support growth of the virus. Leukocytes, however, are the target cells in naturally infected birds. This natural susceptibility to infection in the bird was the basis for the selection of this cell type. Another aspect which is critical to the success of the experimentation is the ability to distinguish between infected and non infected cells.Through the development of a monoclonal antibody which reacts specifically with REV and other viruses of the Group Tl AA virus group, an extremely sensitive fluorescent antibody test was established.This test allows for the detection of extremely low levels of virus. It is suspected that other investigators were not able to distinguish between nfected and non infected cells because they used theHEV antiserum produced in turkeys. This results in a great deal of background or non specific fluorescence which reduces the sensitivity and specifity of the test considerably. Additionally, other investigators, notably Perrin et al, when testing for te presence of infectious virus in cell culture, have tended to examine the cell culture supernatant Icr ch contains a high level of residual virus from he original inoculum.Generally, greater than 90 of adenoviruses remain intracellular, and therefore t is believed that for this reason examination of he cells and cell extracts give a more accurate indication of the propagation of the infectious virus in cell culture. Another aspect which enhances the success of the experimentation is the use of serum free of antibodies to Group II AA as a growth promotant in the culture medium. Previously, most investigators have used an agar gel precipitation test to detect the presence of antibodies in the serum. This test, while specific, is not very sensitive. Through the development of an extremely sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA technique for measuring HEV antibody in serum, detection of much lower levels of antibody in serum can be achieved. This allows for a very accurate screening of the turkey serum prior to incorporating it into the culture medium.Since t sera of most turkeys, and probably chickens as well, contain antibodies to Group II AA viruses, 4 it is likely that other investigators who incorporated serum into their culture media, even through it was screened by the agar gel precipitation test, may have been incorporating antibodies at the same tine. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus and may have prevented or reduced the degree of infectivitv. 3 Summary of the Invention A method for the in vitro propagation ofGroup II avlan adeno AA viruses is accomplished by a process of isolating leukocytes which are susceptible to infection with Group II AA viruses from body tissues or fluids referred to hereandafter generally as tissues of birds and growing them in culture. absequently, the cells are infected withGroup II AA v virus and, after a period of replication within the cells, the virus is harvested from the leukocyte cell culture.This method is useful in the propagation of both virulent and avirulent strains ofGroup I AA viruses and in the preparation of vaccines effective against haemorrhagic enteritis HE of turkeys, Marble Spleen Disease MSD of pheasants, non Marek s Disease associated splenomegaly of chickens SV and other related diseases caused by Group II AA viruses in given avian species. One aspect of the invention provides a method for the in vitro propagation of Group II avian adeno AA viruses comprising a isolating leukocytes harvested from the spleen, blood, bone marrow or other tissue of avian specien, said leukocytes being susceptible to infection with said Group II AA viruses and b culturing these leukocytes in a suitable growth medium and c inoculating the leukocyte cell culture with one of the Group II AA viruses and d propagating said inoculated cell culture under conditions suitable for the growth of the virus. Another aspect of the invention is a method of establishing a cell line which will support the growth of Group II AA viruses comprising harvesting leukocytes from the tissues of avian species and serially passaging said leukocytes in culture. Another aspect of the invention provides a method for the preparation of a vaccine active against HE, MSD, SV and other related diseases caused by avian adenoviruses in given avian species, which comprises in vitro propagation of the Group II AA virus in leukocyte cell culture thereby to produce a virus which can be used to induce immunity in said given species. This invention provides a method for the preparation of a vaccine active against haemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys, marble spleen disease of pheasants, non Marek s disease associated splenomegaly of chickens and other related diseases in poultry caused by Group II avian adeno AA viruses, whereby an in vitro propagated preparation of a Group II AA virus is utilized, this latter preparation comprising a isolating leukocytes harvested from the spleen, blood, bone marrow or other tissues of avian species, said leukocytes being susceptible to infection with Group II AA virus and b culturing these leukocytes in a suitable growth medium and c inoculating the leukocyte cell culture with the Group II AA virus and d propagating said inoculated cell culture under conditions suitable for the growth of said virus and e recovering said virus.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system of culturing Group IIAA virus which is suitable for propagating virus in cells not latently infected with Marek s DiseaseVirus. It is also an object of the invention to provide a safe, stable, and efficacious vaccine for immunizing turkeys and other avian species against diseases caused by Group II AA viruses. Another object of the invention is to establish a leukocyte cell line which will support the growth of Group II AA viruses. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become readily apparent fro the ing description.4 Detailed Description of the Invention The invention relates to a method of isolating leukocytes which are susceptible to infect ion with Group II AA viruses and culturing them.

Another preferred method of isoltitinf om blood includes the a Drawing an equal volume of turkey blood into a syringe containing buffered anti coagulant for example phosphate buffered saline containing 0.005 mM sodium EDTA and 10 units ml of heparin pH 7.2 . b Layering this mixture on Ficoll Paque and centrifuging for 20 minutes at 800 x g. c Harvesting the leukocytes from on top of the Ficoll Paque, washing twice and resuspending the cells in growth medium. d Culturing the leukocytes as in f above. e After harvesting as in c above, leukocytes from on top of the Ficoll Paque can be further purified by centrifugation in a step wisePercoll 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 Percoll in RPMI 1640 gradient for 30 minutes at 3,000 RPM. Cells on the surface of the 40 and 50 percoll solution are removed, washed twice in growth medium, resuspended to a concentration of approximately 106 cells ml and cultured under conditions described above. The haemorrhagic enteritis virus HEV used to infect cell cultures included both virulent and avirulent strains. These strains were received fromDr. Charles Domermuth, Virginia AgriculturalExperiment Station, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia in 1980. One preferred strain of HEV is the avirulent strain of e virus which is believed to be the same as the marble spleen disease MSD virus deposited in theAmerican Type Culture Collection in Rockville, MD., and assigned Accession No. ATCC VR 898. Its origin and known characteristics have been previously described in Domermuth, C.H. et al, J.Wild Dis 11 33 34, 1975. For the purposes of cultivating GroupIT AA virus in accordance with the invention, either this HEV MSD virus or any other Group II AA virus having similar characteristice would be useful.This is HEV MSD culture is known not to cross react with otrer croup I avian adenoviruses, but does cross react It other Group II AA viruses. Other sources of virus for inoculating the leukocyte culture can include, but is not restricted tc. fluids such as blood , tissues s ch as spleen , or feces of birds infected with Group II AA virus. In one preferred embodiment, crude virus containing extract, or extrct purified by chloroform extraction and cesium chloride centrifugation, from lyrphatic organs, preferably spleen, are prepared from turkeys infected with virulent or avirulent Group II AA virus as follows a Turkeys infected with Group II AA virus are sacrificed 4 6 days after infection, their speens removed and added to 9 volumes of hypotonic Tris buffer 0.01 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1 . b Spleens are homogenized for example using the Brinkman polytron for 10 15 minutes . c Homogenate is treated to release virus from the spleen cells as for example by freezing and thawing twice and or sonicating 3 times for 1 minute at 400 watts with a Braunsonic 1510 . d Centrifuging 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove cellular debris, and using the virus containing supernatant to inoculate leukocyte cell cultures. The crude extract described above can be further purified using the following steps starting at d . e Combining the crude extract with chloroform in a ratio of 1 2 v v and repeating the homogenization, then centrifuging for 10 minutes at 10,000 RPM in order to separate the extract into 3 layers a top aqueous phase containing the virus, an intermediate layer containing cellular debris, and a bottom chloroform layer containing fatty material. f The clear aqueous phase top layer is harvested and the virus pelleted overnight at 10,000RPM, resuspended in Tris buffer and extracted an additional 2 or 3 times in chloroform. g Following the final extraction, the virus is concentrated by pelleting for 1 hour at 20,000 RPM using a cesium chloride cushion, and then banded twice through a cesium chloride gradient for 24 hours at 40,000 RPM. The majority of infectious virus is found in a band having a density of 1.331.34 g c3. h The harvested virus is dialized against storage buffer, filtered through a 0.45 micron Millipore filter and used to inoculate leukocyte cell cultures, or stored at 70 C. Either virulent or avirulent strains ofGroup II AA viruses can be cultured in the cells.These virus strains differ in their pathogenicity for birds. For example, avirulent strains of HEV cause only transient splenomegaly while virulent strains cause splenomegaly as well as intestinal bleeding and death in some cases. Cell cultures are infected with viruscontaining ex4,r cts as outlined above, usually within 1 3 hours after the cell culture is established. An appropriate dilution of virus containing extract, usually in the ra gt of 10 2 to 10 6 depending on the infectivity of each virus preparation, is added to the cell culture. Infected cell cultures are maintained in growth medium and incubated at 41 C in an atmosphere of 5 C02 and 95 RH. Generally the virus is harvested 1 3 days after inoculation. The infected cells in the cultures are mostly enlarged and contain intranuclear inclusions which can be observed with a light microscope. There is no difference in appearance between leukocyte cultures infected With a virulent or avirulent strain of HEV. The presence of viral antigens in the leukocytes fter 1 ection is detected by a fluorescent antibody PA test, or b other tests known in the art, using mouse monoclonal antibodies against specific proteins of Group II AA viruses. In this test, leukocytes from cell culture are fixed onto glass slides by techniques commonly used in the art. The fixed cells are incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in a humid chamber in hybridoma cell medium.After washing the cells, fluorescein labelled goat anti mouse IgG is added and the cells are incubated for 1 hour at 37 C after which time the preparations are mounted using techniques known in the art and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Cells infected with Group II AA virus fluoresce and the proportion of infected cells is estimated by counting fluorescent cells and total cells in several microscope fields. The infected cells are usually 10 12 in diameter, sometimes larger. They often contain vacuoles in the cytoplasm and show nuclear inclusion bodies which are seen in both adhered and non adhered cells. Ultra thin sections of fixed leukocytes cultures examined under the electron microscope revealed virus particles 70 90 nm in the nuclei of the cells. The cells were quite large 10 40 p , had phagosomes and mitochondria in the cytoplasm and perinclear chromatin in the nucleus. Based on these observations it is felt that the cells are immature large macrophages or monocytes. However, this cannot be confirmed simply on the basis of morphology. The invention further relates to the preparation of a vaccine for the immunization of turkeys and other avian species against HEV of turkeys, MSD of pheasants and non Marek s disease associated splenomegaly of chickens and other related diseases associated by Group II AA viruses. In preparing a vaccine for use in inoculating birds against HEV, the virus can be recovered from the infected whole cell culture, cells harvested from the whole cell culture, the culture medium or the supernatant fluid, by techniques known in the art. For example, adhered cells are detached from the tissue culture flask with a rubber policeman and together with non adhered cells are pelleted by centrifugation 5 minutes at 2,000 RPM . The cells are disrupted to promote virus release by suspending them in hypotonic Tris buffer 0.01 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1 , freezing and thawing twice, and or sonicating for example, 3 cycles of 20 seconds at 100 watts, using the Braunsonic 1510 sonicator . Cellular debris is removed by centrifugation 10 minutes at 10,000 RPM , the supernatant containing the virus is recovered and dialized against storage buffer, filtered through a 0.45 p filter, combined with storage buffer and stored. One preferred method for the recovery of the virus comprises a rupturing the leukocyte cells by sonication, freezing and thawing, or osmotic shock and b selectively separating the virus containing the supernatant from cellular debris by centrifugation. The resultant supernatant is then dialized and combined with a preferred storage buffer, the formula of which is 0.02 M Tris HC1, 0.001 M MgCl2, 5 volume volume glycerol, and 5 weight volume bovine serum albumin pH 8.0. This buffer is a combination of 2 buffers previously reported in the literature. The sources are 1 Prage, L., Petterson, U., Hoglund, S., and lonberg Holm, K., and Philipson, L., StructuralProteins of Adenoviruses. IVC SequentialDegradation of the Adenovirus Type II Viron.

The use of a cell culture grown virus plus the use of a buffer provides a stable product which can be stored in a liquid form. This is an advantage and an improvement over the currently used crude spleen extract vaccine which, because of the presence of tissue enzymes, is unstable and must be stored at 70 C. Other buffers known to the art may also be used to dialyze and combine with the vaccine for storage. The vaccine can then also be lyophilized for storage. Furthermore, the vaccine may be combined with an adjuvant selected from the group of Preund s Adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum potassium sulfate, or other suitable adjuvants known in the art. It is envisioned that vaccinal amounts of vaccine would be administered orally in the drinking water or feed, by aerosol, or by other conventional methods to protect against HE in turkeys, MSD in pheasants and SV of chickens. Insofar as the avirulent HEV is known to protect fowl against virulent HEV, it of course would be the preferred strain for use in vaccine production. However, other avirulent Group II AA would also be suitable. Also provided by the present invention are various criteria for determining suitable ranges for defining an effective turkey dose. a Although at the present time it is difficult to quantify the number of virus particles in the culture harvest, selection of a culture harvest containing a minimum of 10 virus particles is believed to provide a safe and effective dose. b Culture harvest containing sufficient virus to induce a serum antibody titer of at least 1 20 as determined by ELISA. At the present time, effective protection can be achieved with an antibody titer of 1 80. However, since this may vary somewhat with the age of the bird, a more conservative titer has been selected to define a protective dose. An indirect ELISA for the titration of HEV antibodies was carried out in 3 steps i HEV, used for coating was extracted from spleens of experimentally infected turkeys and purified on CsCl gradients. The virus band with a density of 1.34 g c3 was treated with an equal volume of 2 MCaCl2 and incubated for 30 min at 37it. Thereafter, 96 well polystyrene microtiter plates Immulon 2, I ynatech Laboratories were coated with antigen 0.2 ml per well in an optimal dilution of 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 2h at 37 C. After coating the plates, they were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05 Tween 20 PBS T , pH 7.4, ii serum samples to be tested and positive and negative control sera in two fold dilutions in 10 x PBS T containing 1 V V newborn calf serum were incubated for 2h at 57 C 0.2 ml per well , iii after three washings with PBS T, the plates were incubated with 0.2 ml rabbit anti turkeyIg G peroxidase conjugate diluted 1 1000 containing 1 newborn calf serum for 2h at 37 C. After three more washings with PBS T, the plates were incubated with 0.2 ml per well of substrate solution containing 5 aminosalicyclic acid 0.08 , W V andH202 0.005 V V , pH 6.0. The enzymatic activity was measured after 30 min at room temperature with a micro ELISA reader MR 580,Dynatech Laboratories at 492 nm. All tests were done in duplicate and each assay included 2 positive control sera with known titers and 4 negative control sera. c Culture harvest used at dilutions ranging from undiluted to 10 9, but preferably at a range of 10 2 to 10 4. A further preferred embodiment of the present invention is the establishment of a leukocyte cell line which will support the growth of Group IIAA viruses and comprises harvesting leukocytes from the tissues of avian species, which includes but is not limited to the spleen, blood and bone marrow, and serially passaging the leukocytes in culture. The following examples are intended only to further illustrate the invention and are not intended Trademark to limit the scope of the invention witch s defined by the claims.EXAMPLE 1 INFECTION OF TURKEY SPLEEN LEUKOCYTES WITH AVIRULENT HAEMORRHAGIC ENTERITIS VIRUS Leukocyte cultures were prepared from the spleens of 5 and 12 week old turkey poults. The leukocytes were obtained from homogenized decapsulated turkey spleens and isolated by centrifugation onto a Ficoll Paque solution for 20 min at 800 x g. The leukocytes were subsequently harvested, washed, resuspended in growth medium 1 x 106 cells per ml , plated in tissue culture flasks and incubated in an atmosphere of 5 C02, 95 relative humidity and 41 C. Three hours after seeding, the cell cultures were inoculated with crude spleen extract containing avirulent HEV or purified virus prepared as described above. One, 2 and 3 days after inoculation with virus, the cell cultures were examined by FAT to determine the percent of infected cells Tables 5 and 6 .

EXAMPLE 3 COMPARIWOI OF TURKEY ELOCD LEUKUCYTES OPTAINED BY TWO DIFFERENT PROCEDURES FOR THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF HEV Thirty ml of blood was obtained from a 9 week old turkey poult. Leukocytes were separated from the whole blood by either the Ficoll Paque method or the Ficoll Paque followed by the Percoll purification step, and used to establish cell cultures. The Ficoll Paque purification was carried out as outlined in Example 2. The Percoll procedure included further separation of the leukocytes by centrifuging the leukocyte fraction obtained afterFicoll Paque purification through a stepwise Percoll gradient 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Percoll in RPMI 1640 for 30 min at 3,000 RPM.The leukocytes on the surface of the 40 and 50 Percoll were collected, washed, resuspended in growth medium, seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in an environment of 5 C02, 95 relative humidity and 41 C. The cultures were infected with a 10 3 dilution of a crude spleen extract of avirulent HEV, and 2 and 4 days following inoculation the percentage of infected cells in each leukocyte culture was determined Table 8 .

The percentage of cells infected with virus free control was 0.1 .EXAMPLE 4 USE OF HEV GROWN IN LEUKOCYTE CELL CULTURE AS A VACCINE AGAINST HAEMORRHAGIC ENTERITIS OF TURKEYS Thirty ml of blood collected from a 20 wee old turkey was used to prepare a leukocyte culture by the Ficoll Paque method described above.The leukocyte cultures were infected with a 10 3 dilution of a crude spleen extract containing avirulent H V. Two days after infection, 4.3 of the cells were infected as determined by the FA test. At this time, adhered and non adhered cells were harvested by centrifugation. The Virus was released from the cells by resuspending the cell pellet in hypotonic Tris buffer 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 8.1 , freezing and thawing twice and sonicating. Following ow speed centrifugation to remove debris, the virus containing supernatant was combined with PBS to a tctal volume of 30 ml. Serial 10 fold dilutions undiluted to 10 4 of the virus PBS solution were prepared. One 1 of each dilution was used to orally vaccinate 6 old old turkey poults 8 turkeys group . Serum c amrles, to determine antibody titer to HEV were taken on days 8, 15 and 20 after vaccination. The turkeys were orally challenged by inoculation with virulent HEV on day 15. Five days following challenge with virulent virus on day 20 the birds were sacrificed and the spleens collected and examined for the presence of enlargement and HEV antigen.HEV antigen, indicating lack of protection, was present in all 8 unvaccinated control birds after challenge. Only 8 of 39 vaccinated birds had HEV antigen indicating that the cell culture grown virus was protective Table 9 . In addition 31 out of the 39 birds seroconverted and developed protective antibody titers after vaccination.

EXAMPLE 5 PASSAGE OF AVIRULENT HEV IN PRIMARY BLOOD LEUKOCYTE CULTURE Crude spleen extract from avirulent HEVInfected turkeys final dilution 10 5 was used for the initial infection of blood leukocytes from turkeys obtained by Ficoll Paque centrifugation passage 1 . After 3 days in culture te cells were collected and virus was released from the cells by freezing and thawing twice and ultrasonic treatment as described above. HEV harvested from passage 1 was used to infect a new culture of turkey blood leukocytes passage 2 . These cells were processed as before to release virus which was subsequently used to infect new leukocytes passage 3 . This process was repeated for 7 passages of HEV in turkey blood leukocytes. At each step, 10 of the previous cell extract was used to infect the same number of leukocytes as in the previous culture Table 10 .The culture conditions for the cultures were the same as described before.Table 10 Passage of Avirulent HEV in Primary Blood Leukocyte Cultures Percentage Infected CellsaDays Post Passage NumberInfection 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NEb NE 0.1 Ne 0.1 NE NE 2 4.3 1.8 0.6 0.3 0.4 NE 0.4 3 NE 3.8 1.0 0.6 0.9 1.8 1.65 a Determined by FAT.b NE not examined. EXAMPLE 6 THE ABILITY OF PASSAGED SUBCULTURED TURKEY BLOOD LEUKOCYTES TC SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF HEV Turkey blood leukocytes were obtained by centrifugation of 50 ml blood on a Ficoll Paque gradient as described earlier and maintained in culture dishes under the same conditions as described above. The cells of 1 culture dish were not subcultured while the cells of the 3 other culture dishes were subcultured 2 times, 3 times and 4 times, respectively thereby creating a leukocyte cell line.Both the primary leukocyte culture and leukocyte cell line were infected with crude spleen extract of avirulent HV infected turkeys final extract dilutedData from this experiment are presented inTable 11.

The virus containing suspension was combined with PBS to a total volume of 15 ml, whereafter its efficacy as a vaccine for HE in turkeys was tested in a dose response challenge trial as ascribed inExample 4.All birds vaccinated at a dilution of 10 1, 10 2, 10 3, and 3 of 8 birds vaccinated at a dilution of 10 4, were found tc be protected when challenged by the following criteria 1 they had protective antibody titers 88 by ELISA 2 they did not have HEV antigen in their spleens titers 100 by antigen ELISA and 3 they did not have intestinal haemorrhages. No protection was found after challenge in the remaining 5 birds vaccinated at a dilution of 10 4, and in the S control birds which were not vaccinated. This experiment shows clearly that after seven serial passages of the avirulent strain of HEV in cell culture the produced virus still can be used as an effective vaccine.
