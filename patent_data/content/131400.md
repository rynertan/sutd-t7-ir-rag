# Metal salts of lower dialkylphosphorodithioic acids.

## Abstract
Certain metal salts of one or more dialkylphos phorodithioic acids are disclosed wherein A the alkyl groups each contain from two to four carbon atoms and at least one alkyl group is a butyl group B the total number of carbon atoms per phosphorus atom is less than 8 C from about 30 to 90 mole percent of the alkyl groups are primary alkyl groups D from about 10 to 70 mole percent of the alkyl groups are secondary alkyl groups and E the metal salt is a zinc, copper or iron salt, mixtures thereof, or a mixture of calcium salt and one or more of said metal salts provided that when only 2 alkyl groups are present, from about 30 to 80 mole percent of the alkyl groups are n butyl groups, from about 20 to 70 mole percent of the said alkyl groups are isopropyl groups. These metal salts are oil soluble and are useful as antiox idants and anti wear agents particularly in lubricating oil compositions.
