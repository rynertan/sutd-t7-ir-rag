## Description
STRIP CASTING APPARATUS The present invention relates to strip casting apparatus for the casting of strip material at high quench rates and at high production rates. More particularly, the present invention is directed to apparatus for rapidly casting thin metallic strip material. Incorporated herein, by reference, is the subject mater of our co filed European Patent Applications entitled Method And Apparatus For Strip Casting , 11Method Of Repetitiously Marking Continuously CastMetallic Strip Material , Apparatus For Strip Casting nd Strip Casting Material . The apparent advantages and economic significance of producing thin metallic strip material by a casting process, as compared to the conventional rolling or reducing operations, are numerous. The fact that strip casting may be performed at such high quench rates as to prepuce amorphous material is even more meaningful. However, it is equally apparent that there are a multitude of strip casting parameters which must be controlled or manitored to assure that the cast strip is of acceptable quality and of uniform composition and structure. For these reasons, those skilled in the art appreciate the intricacies involved in the development of a commercially successful strip casting apparatus. The general concept of casting thin metallic materials such as sheet, foil, strip and ribbon was disclosed in the early l900 s. For example, United StatesPatents Nos. 905,758 and 993,904 teach processes wherein molten material flows onto a moving cool surface and the material is drawn and hardened thereon into a continuous thin strip. These references teach that molten metal may be poured onto the smooth peripheral surface of a rotating liquid cooled copper drum or disc to form strip materialsDespite early disclosure of such concept, there is no evidence of commercial success of strip casting during the early part of the 20th century. Recently, in United States Patents Nos. 3,522,836 and 3,605,863 a method for manufacturing a continuous product, such as metallic wire or strip, from molten metal has been disclosed. These references teach that a convex meniscus of molten material should project from a nozzle. A heat extracting surface, such as a watercooled drum, is moved in a path substantially parallel to the outlet orifice and into contact with the meniscus of molten metal to continuously draw material from the meniscus to form a uniform continuous product. The above described method is commonly called the melt drag process as the heat extracting surface moving past the meniscus of molten metal at the nozzle orifice actually has an effect on the rate of molten metal flow, or drag through the nozzle. More recent strip casting developments focus on relatively narrow refinements in the metallic strip casting art. For example, United States Patent No.4,142,571 is particularly directed to a slot construction in a metal strip casting nozzle having stringent dimensional requirements. Also, United States Patent No.4,007,462 pertains to the provision of a specific construction for a stationary housing above the peripheral surface of a chill roll used for strip casting. There are a number of other rapid quenching techniques known in the art. For example, melt spinning processes of producing metallic filament by cooling a fine molten stream either in free flight or against a chill block have been practised. Also known are melt extraction techniques, such as crucible melt extraction disclosed inUnited States Patent No. 3,838,185, pendant drop melt extraction techniques taught in United States Patent No.3,896,203 and splat cooling explained in United StatesPatent No. 3,297,436. It has been found difficult to produce uniform sheet or strip by such alternative techniques of rapid quenching. There are many factors, such as casting temperature and pressure, auxiliary surface cooling rates, surface coatings for the casting surface, and the like which appear to affect the product thickness, the quality and the reproducibility of rapidly cast strip material. Despite the relatively long history of the art of strip casting, and the recent developments in this area, strip casting is not a widely accepted and commercially significant operation at the present time. It appears that various improvements, modifications and or innovations are required in the art before there is likely to be any significant commercial impact in the art of strip casting. In particular, proper relationships among such variables as molten metal tundish construction, nozzle orifice size and dimensions, spacing from a casting surface,. speed at which such surface is moved, quench rates, metal temperature and feed rates, and the like may require more accurateidentification and interrelation in order to accomplish the uniformity and consistency required for successful, commercial production of cast strip.In particular, certain nozzle structures and their dimensional relationship to the casting surface onto which strip material is cast, have been found to be desirable to yield uniform strip casting results when utilized in various casting parameters. Accordingly, a new and improved apparatus for casting relatively wide, thin strip material is desired which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art structures. Such desired apparatus should be reliable, more effecient and more effective than the structures disclosed in the prior art, and should lead to reproducibilitx, un formity and consistency in strip casting. The present invention has as an object thereof the provision of a strip casting apparatus which is capable of continuously casting metallic strip material of substantially uniform dimension and substantially uniform quality throughout its length. Another object of the present invention is to enable the provision of a strip casting apparatus having a nozzle construction which promotes the efficient rapid casting of metal strip material with a minimum of metal turbulence during casting. Another object of the present invention is to provide a strip casting apparatus capable of reproducing successful strip casting operations. Another object of this invention is to provide a strip casting apparatus which can effect sufficiently rapid quenching of the produced strip to result in the production of amorphous strip. However, it should be understood that the production of continuously cast crystalline material is equally comprehended by the present invention. A further object of this invention according to a preferred emdodiment thereof, is to identify certain design and dimensional requirements, particularly with regard to nozzle structure, which permit continuous and repetitious rapid casting of metallic strip material of uniform dimension and uniform quality. The present invention provides apparatus for continuously casting metal strip comprising a tundish for receiving and holding molten metal, a nozzle comprising a curvilinear element disposed in the tundish, said curvilinear element having an orifice passage therein, with the longitudinal extent of the orifice passage approximating the width of the strip to be cast, said orifice passage having substantially uniform cross sectional dimensions throughout the longitudinal extent thereof, a cooled casting surface at least as wide as the strip to be cast, disposed at a standoff distance of less than 3.048mm .120 inch from the nozzle, movable past the orifice passage in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the orifice passage, said orifice passage defined between a first side portion and a second side portion of the curvilinear element. The invention will be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side elevation, partially in cross section, illustrating apparatus according to the present invention for continuously casting strip material. Figure 2 is a fragmentary cross sectional view on a larger scale of part of a tundish and nozzle forming part of the apparatus of Fig. 1. Figure 3 is a perspective riew on a still larger scale of a curvilinear element which forms the nozzle shown in Fig. 2. Figure 4 is an even more enlarged fragmentary cross sectional view through the orifice passage of the nozzle element shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 5 is a fragmentary cross sectional view on the same scale as Fig. 4 through the orifice passage of an alternative form of nozzle element which can be used in the apparatus of the present invention. Figure 6 is a cross sectional view on substantially the same scale as Fig. 2 of the orifice passage of another alternative nozzle element which can be used in the apparatus of the present invention. Figure 7 is a view similar to Figs. 4 and 5 but illustrating a further alternative orifice passage in a nozzle element which can be used in apparatus according to the present invention, and Figure 8 is a view similar to Fig. 7 but illustrating yet another alternative orifice passage in a nozzle element for use in apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 generally illustrates apparatus according to the present invention for casting metallic strip material 10. This apparatus includes a casting drum, wheel, belt, or the like upon which the strip 10 is cast. In the preferred embodiment illustrated a continuous strip 10 is cast onto a smooth, outer peripheral surface 14 of a circular drum or wheel 12 as shown in Figure 1. It should be understood that configurations other than circular may be employed. For example, a wheel with a smooth, frustoconical outer peripheral surface not shown may be employed. Also, a belt capable of rotating through a generally ovular path may be employed as the casting element.Regardless of the configuration employed, the casting surface 14 should be cooled to a temperature below the solidus temperature of the metal being cast and should be at least as wide as the strip to be cast. In the preferred embodiment, the casting surface 14 compriseS the surface of the water cooled, precipitation hardened copper alloy wheel 12 containing about 98 copper with about 2 chromium. Copper and copper alloys are preferable because of their high thermal conductivity and wear resistance. However, berillium copper alloys, steel, brass, aluminum, aluminum alloys or other materials may be utilized alone, or in combination.For example, multipiece wheels having outer peripheral sleeves of molybdenum or other material may be employed.Likewise, cooling may be accomplished with the use of a medium other than water. Water is typically chosen for its low cost and its ready availability. In the operation of the strip casting apparatus of the present invention, the surface 14 of the casting wheel 12 must be able to absorb the heat generated by contact with molten metal at the initial casting point 16, and such heat must be conducted substantially into the copper wheel during each rotation of the wheel. The initial casting point 16 xefers to the approximate location on the casting surface 14 where molten metal 20 flowing from a crucible or tundish 22 contacts the casting surface 14.Cooling, by heat conduction, may be accomplished by delivering a sufficient quantity of water through internal passageways located near the periphery of the casting wheel 12. Alternatively, the cooling medium may be delivered directly to the underside of the casting surface.Understandably, refrigeration techniques and the like may be employed to accelerate or decelerate cooling rates, and or to effect wheel expansion or contraction during strip casting. Whether a drum,wheel or belt is employed for casting, the casting surface should be generally smooth and symmetrical to maximize uniformity in strip casting. For example, in certain strip casting operations the distance between the outer peripheral casting surface 14 and the surfaces defining the orifice passage of the nozzle which feeds the molten material onto the casting surface 14 must not deviate from a desired or set distance during the casting operation. This distance shall hereinafter be called the standoff distance or gap. It is understandable that the gap should be substantially maintained throughout the casting operation when it is the intention to cast uniform strip material. It should be understood that if the casting is perforred on a rotating body, such as a drum or the wheel 12, the rotating body should be carefully constructed so as not to be out of round during operation to endure uniformity in strip casting. Along these lines, it has been found that a drum or wheel which is out of round by about 0.508mm 0.020 inch , or more, may have a magnitude of dimensional instability which unless corrected or compensated during operation, may be unacceptable for certain strip casting operations. It has been found that acceptable dimensional symmetry, as well as the elimination of problems associated with weld porosity, may be more readilv accomplished by fabricating a wheel or drum from a single integral slab of rolled or forged copper alloy.However as mentioned above, alternative materials including s leeves and coatings may be employed. The molten material 20 to be cast in the apparatus described herein is preferably retained in the crucible or tundish 22, which is provided with a discharge nozzle.The nozzle is typically, though not necessarily, located at a lower portion of the tundish 22, as shown in Fig 1, and the nozzle 24 comprises a curvilinear element 24 mounted in the tundish 22. The curvilinear element 24, located in or forming a lower portion of the tundish 22 is best shown in the tundish 22 in Figure 2, and in perspective view inFigure 3. As shown in the drawings an orifice passage 30 is preferably substantially centrally located in the nozzle element 24. Such approximate central location of the orifice passage, or slot, 30 helps to assure uniformity as the pressure of the molten metal bearing thereagainst is substantially equalized during the casting operation It should be understood, however, that the slot may be located in off center positions as may be desired. The longitudinal extent of the orifice passage 30 should approximate the width of the strip to be cast.There does not appear to be a limitation on the longitudinal extent of the orifice passage, and, passages as long as 915mm thirty six inches , or longer, in a curvilinear element may be used. It is highly desired that the molten metal flow uniformly through the orifice passage 30 in the curvilinear nozzle element 24 in order to form uniform, high quality strip material. In an alternative embodiment, strip of various widths may be produced by cutting multiple longitudinally aligned orifice passages 30 of appropriate longitudinal extent in the curvilinear element 24 forming the nozzle of a tundish 22, as opposed to a single orifice passage 30.Regardless of the size of the orifice passage 30, or passages, the cross sectional dimensions of each passage 30 should be substantially uniform throughout the longitudinal extent thereof to produce strip material having uniform dimensions. In the operation of the strip casting apparatus of the present invention, the cooled casting surface 14 moves past the orifice passage 30 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudunal axis of the passage 30. As best shown in Figure 4, the orifice passage 30 is defined between a first side portion 32 and a second side portion 34 of the curvilinear element 24. The first side portion 32, is located on the downstream side of the.orifice passage 30, with respect to the direction of movement of the casting surface 14 indicated by the arrow in Figure 4. The first side portion 32 has an inside surface 36 which preferably, is substantially planar, and an outer lip projecting surface 38 disposed toward and facing the casting surface 14. At a downstream location from the orifice passage 30, the outer lip projecting surface 38 is relieved, such as at 40, to define a lip projection 42.The second side portion 34 is located on the upstream side of the orifice passage 30, with respect to the direction of movement of the casting surface 14 indicated by the arrow in Figure 4. The second side portion 34 has an inside surface 46, which preferably, is substantially planar and, also preferably, is substantially parallel to and facing the inside surface 36 of the first side portion 32 at least at an outer portion of the orifice passage 30 with respect to the direction of metal flow from the tundish 22 through the passage 30. A bottom surface 48 of the second side portion 34 is disposed toward and facing the casting surface 14. In a preferred embodiment, the outer lip projecting surface 38 of the first side portion 32 and a portion of the bottom surface 48 of the second side portion 34 are in substantially complete parallelism with the casting surface 14 movable therebelow. When utilizing a drum or wheel 12, and a grindable curvilinear elemen 24, such substantially complete parallelism may be accomplished by placing a sheet of sandpaper,or the like, against the casting surface 14 with the grit side of the sandpaper facing the curvilinear element.By moving the curvilinear element into tight contact with the casting surface 14, with the sandpaper disposed therebetween, and by moving the casting surface 14 and sandpaper simultaneously past the nozzle 24, the outer lip projecting surface 38 of the first side portion 32 and the bottom surface 48 of the second side portion 34 are ground by the grit side of the sandpaper into substantially complete parallelism with the casting surface 14. Such parallelism may be achieved on most refractory nozzles, even when round or other curvilinear casting surfaces are employed. To achieve such parallelism by this procedure 400 or 600 grit sandpaper has been found to be adequate. By maintaining at least a portion of the outer lip projecting surface 38 in complete parallelism with the casting surface 14, the standoff distance, or gap h between the outer lip projecting surface 38 and the casting surface 14 may be maintained throughout the length of the projection 42. It has been found that the gap h between the outer lip projecting surface 38 and the casting surface 14 must be maintained at less than about 3.048mm 0.120 inch in order to successfully cast strip material. Preferably, this gap h is maintained at less than about 2.032mm 0.080 inch and for casting certain alloys into thin gauge strip, a gap h of less than 0.254mm 0.010 inch is preferred. It has also been found that the gap h between the bottom surface 48 of the second side portion 34 does not appear to be as critical.What is. preferred with respect to the second side portion 34 is that the inside surface 46 thereof extend toward the casting surface 14 while parallel to the inside surface 36 of the first side portion 32, at least in an outer portion of the orifice passage 30, so as not to interfere with the maintenance of a stable flow of molten metal through the passage 30 in the curvilinear element 24 and onto the moving casting surface 14. Accordingly, the bottom surface 48 of the second side portion 34 mav just clear the casting surface 14, i.e. be within about 0.0508mm .002 inch thereof as shown in Figure 7, or alternatively, the bottom surface 48 may be tapered from the orifice in a direction away from the casting surface 14, as shown in Figure 8. In any event, the gap h between the bottom surface 48 of the second side portion 34 and the casting surface 14 must be sufftciently restricted at the nozzle to prevent significant molten metal backflow therebetween during casting. In an alternative embodiment, shown in Figure 5, the inside surface 36 of the first side portion 32 extends through a curvilinear surface 50 to the outer lip projecting surface 38, rather than through the abrupt 900 juncture shown in Figure 4. Providing such radiused corner surface 50 has been found beneficial in the production of certain grades of strip material More particularly, such radiused corner surface 50 helps minimize molten metal turbulence during strip casting and, therefore, results in more uniform production parameters.It has also been found that a sharp corner between the inside surface 36 and the outer lip projecting surface 38 may be subjected to various pressures and flow patterns which ould create stress conditions for curvilinear elements 24 made of certain materials and, in some instances, may break, crack or wear during casting thereby upsetting balanced strip casting conditions. Providing such rounded corner surface 50 may minimize the adverse affects of such turbulence and metal flow through the curvilinear element 24 comprising the nozzle of the tundish 22. To further minimize turbulence during strip casting through the apparatus of the present invention, an inside portion of the orifice passage 30 may be relieved, or tapered. As shown in the drawings, both the first side portion 32 and the second side portion 34 may be cut into aV shape, or a more rounded U shape at an inside portion thereof, creating an initial funnel type structure, which further maximizes uniformity in metal flow patterns and minimizes irregularities or turbulence during strip casting. Another preferred arrangement, which minimizes molten metal turbulence during strip casting, is to arrange the curvilinear element 24 at an angle such that the metal is fed in the same direction as the casting surface 14.This may be accomplished by disposing the inside surfaces 36 and 46, defining the orifice passage. 30, toward the casting surface 14 at an angle of less than about 900 0 or preferably at an angle of about 45 . By such arrangement the flowing molten metal is not subjected to as severe a change in flow rate as would be experienced by arrallging the orifice passage 30 to feed molten metal perpendiculax to the casting surface 14 The crucible 22 is preferably constructed of a material having superior insulating ability If the insulating ability is not sufficient to retain the molten material at a relatively constant temperature, auxiliary heaters such as induction coils may have to be provided in and or around the crucible 22, or resistance elements such as wires may be provided. A convenient material for the crucible is an insulating board made from fiberized kaolin, a naturally occurring, high purity, alumina silica fire clay. Such insulating material is available under the trade name Kaowool HS board.However, for sustained operations, and fox highex melting temperature alloys, various other materials may have to be employed for constructing the crucible 22 or the curvilinear element 24 including graphite, alumina graphite, quartz, clay graphite, boron nitride, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, boron carbide,alumina,zirconia and various combinations or mixtures of such materials It should also be understood that these materials may be strengthened for example fiberized kaolin may be strengthened by impregnating with a silica gel or the like. It is imperative that the orifice passage 30 of the curvilinear element 24 remain open and its configuration remain substantially stable throughout a strip casting operation. It is understandable that the orifice passage 30 should not erode or clog, significantly, during a strip casting operation or the primary objectives of maintaining uniformity in the casting operation and of minimizing metal flow turbulence in the tundish 22 may be defeated. Along these lines, it appears that certain insulating materials may not be able to maintain their dimensional stability over long casting periods.To obviate this problem, side portions 32 and 34 forming the orifice passage 30 of the curvilinear element 24 may be constructed of a material which is better able to maintain dimensional stability and integrity during exposure to hiqh molten metal temperatures for prolonged time periods. Such materials may take the form of a single, generally semi circular element 24 with a slot 30 cut theretflrough as shown in Figure 3. Alternatively, the curvilinear element 24 may comprise a pair of facing inserts held in the crucible 22 to form a slot 30 therebetween as shown in Figure 6. In a preferred embodiment the orifice passages 30 in single curvilinear element 4 may be cut ultrasonically to ensure that the desired slot dimensions are accurately provided.Such curvilinear elements 24 may be constructed of materials such as quartz, graphite, clay graphite, boron nitride, alumina graphite, silicon carbide, stabilized zirconia silicate, zirconia magnesia, alumina, or other similar molten metal resistant materials. These curvilinear elements 24 may be held in the crucible 22 mechanically, and or with the aid of adhesives such as various refractory cements. The drive system and housing for the drum wheel or other casting surface 14 of the present invention should be rigidly constructed to permit drum rotation without structural instability which could cause the drum to slip or vibrate. In particular, care should be taken to avoid resonant frequencies at the operating speeds for the casting surface 14. The casting surface 14 should be capable of moving at a surface speed of from about 61 linear surface metres 200 linear surface feet per minute to more than about 3048 linear surface metres 10,000 linear surface feet per minute. When utilizing a drum having a circumference of about 2.44 metres 8 feet , this rate calculates to a drum speed from about 25 rpm to about 1250 rpm.A three horsepower variable speed reversible, dynamically braked motor provides an adequate drive system for an integral copper alloy casting drum about 50.8may 2 inches thick and about 2.44 metres 8 feet in circumference. In one embodiment, the casting surface 14 on the wheel or drum of the apparatus of the present invention is smooth. It has been found that in certain applications, such as for producing amorphous materials, finishing the peripheral surface 14 of a casting drum 12 with 400 grit sandpaper and preferably with 600 grit sandnaper may yield improved product uniformity. In a preferred embodiment as illustrated in Figure 2, the crucible 22 is constructed of an insulating board, such as Kaowool HS Board,and the curvilinear element 24, as shown in Figure 3, is made of clay graphite, a molten metal resistant material, held in the walls of the crucible 22. The orifice passage 30 is cut ultrasonically in the clay graphite element 24. The first side portion 32 and the second side portion 34 of the curvilinear element 24 define the orifice passage, or slot, 30 therebetween. As an alternative, preferred examples of the curvilinear element 24 materials, a plate made of quartz or vycor material, which are highly molten metal resistent materials, having a width such as about 38mm one and one half inch may be bent around an appropriate small radius, as shown in the drawing.Alternatively, the curvilinear element 24 may comprise cast boron nitride. The desired slot forming the orifice passage 30 in the curvilinear element 24, may be accurately cut therein with an ultrasonic drill. A preferred one piece, curvilinear element 24, as best illiastrated in Figures 3 3and 4 may be constructed of a semi circular ring of molten metal resistent material. In this example, a slot b having a width of about 0.254 mm to about 2.032mm 0.010 to about 0.080 inch between parallel inside surfaces 36 and 46 may be ultrasonically drilled into a clay graphite insert material, and the insert may be mounted into the crucible 22 as shown in Figure 2.It should be understood that the design of the outer, peripheral edges of such curvilinear element nozzle may be modified to assist in holding the curvilinear element 24 in the walls of the crucible 22. A preferred orifice passage 30 in the curvilinear element 24 of the apparatus of the present invention is shown in enlarged cross sectior in Figure 4. In one embodiment of this apparatus, the dimensions indicated in Figure 4 may have the following preferred limitations more preferred preferred dimension designation limitation limitation a bottom surface at least 0.0254mum 6.35 12.7mm of second side .001 inch C.25 r .50 inch portion b width of orifice 0.254 2.032mm 0.635 0.889mm passage .010 .080inch 1.025 .035inch c outer lip pro 0.254 4.064mm 0.508 1.524mm jecting surface .01 .16inch .02 .06 inch length d relief at least 0.254mm at least 1.016mm distance .01 inch .04 inch In the production of amorphous strip materials , the width b of the orifice passage 30 is typically in the range of from about 0.254 to about 1.016mm about 0.010 to about 0.040 inch . In the production of crystalline strip material, such as stainless steel, the width b of the orifice passage 30 may be greater, perhaps as high as about 2.032mm 0.080 inch if thick strip is being uniformly produced. Dimension e, representing the cross sectional thickness of the curvilinear element 24, f, representing the width to which a top portion of the orifice passage 30 may be relieved, and , representing the depth to which a top portion of the orifice passage 30 may be relieved, appear to be somewhat arbitrary. Primarily, the purpose of the relief at a top portion of the orifice passage 30, identified by dimensions f and g in Figure 4, is to eliminate clogging of molten metal in the orifice. Molten metal turbulence during strip casting may be minimized, and perhaps avoided by relieving sharp corners of the nozzle in the direction ocsting. It will be understood that such corner relief, such as radiused corner surface 50 shown in Figure 5, may be accomplished by constructing the curvilinear element 24 of an eroding material, such as Kaowool HS board, which may provide natural erosion as a result of the strip casting operation.Turbulence may also be avoided by completely rounding the corner 50 of the projection 42 on the first side portion 32 of the curvilinear element 24 as is shown in Figure 5 during or after manufacture thereof. In an exemplary operation of the apparatus of the present invention, molten metal is delivered to a heated crucible 22. It is understood that a heater, such as induction coils of resistence wire, may be provided in and above the crucible 22 to maintain relatively constant molten metal temperatures as may be desired.Alternatively, the molten metal may be poured directly into a preheated crucible. The preheat temperature should prevent freezing or clogging of the orifice passage 30 during the initial casting operation, and the temperature of the flowing metal should thereafter keep the crucible 22 and curvilinear element 24 forming the nozzle at sufficient temperature to ensure uninterrupted molten metal flow through the orifice passage 30. In certain applications, the curvilinear element 24 may be externally heated throughout the casting operation. Also, the metal which ius fed to the crucible 22 may be superneated to allow a certain degree of temperature es without adversely affecting metal flow through the orifice passage 30. Also, a metallostatic head height in the tundish 22 should be maivntalned at a relatively constant level, typically less than 254 mm ten inches above the orifice passage 30, throughout the casting operation to assure that a relatively constant static head pressure may be maintained at the orifice passage 30. This may be accomplished by initially pouring the molten metal 20 into the crucible 22 to the desired height and thereafter controlling the rate at which additional molten metal 20 is poured into the crucible 22 to maintain the desired metallostatic head. It is understandable that the rate at which additional molten metal 20 is fed to the crucible 22 should be in substantial conformity with the rate at which metal flows from the orifice passage 30 onto the casting surface 14 in forming strip material 10. Maintenance of a relatively constant height of metal in the crucible 22 assures that the molten metal flow pressure through the orifice passage 30 is maintained relatively constant so as not to adversely affect the casting operation or the quality of the strip material 10. Alternatively, externally applied pressure may be employed to control the pressure at the orifice passage 30. Using a tundish or crucible 22 similar to that shown in Figure 1, made of a commercially available tundish material available under the trade name Garnex, a casting run was made on Type 304 stainless steel. The orifice passage 30 at the base of the crucible was about 33.02mm 1.3 inches long and 2.032mm 0.08 inch wide, and the distance,or gap,between the outer, lip projecting surface 38 and casting surface 14 was between 0.508 to 1.016mm cm.02 to 0.04 inch , With. the surface speed of a rotating water cooled copper alloy drum held at about 283 metres C930 feet per minute, molten metal was poured into the crucible 22 at a temperature of about 1593 0C 2900OF estimated with the use of an optical pyrometer.A metallostatic head height of approximately 152.4mm six inches was maintained throughout the casting operation. The strip produced thereby was about 0. 1524 to 2.032mm 0.006 to 0.008 inch thick and exhibited fairly good quality in that it was tough and ductile as cast. During casting of strip material, the tendency of the strip 10 to adhere to the casting surface 14 for a significant distance, such as several feet or more, beyond the initial casting point 16 has been observed.It is understandable that if the strip material 10 remains on a rotating casting drum or wheel 12 for a full revolution, damage to the crucible 22, particularly to the orifice passage 30 in the curvilinear element 24, could result. It has been found that the use of a doctor blade, such as a knife type element riding at or near the drum surface 14, approximately 0.762 to 1.828 metres 2.5 to 6 feet from the orifice easily counters such adherence. With such an arrangement, the cast strip may be removed from the drum 12 by such doctor blade. Such doctor blade has been found particularly useful in the production of thinner amorphous strip materials which appear to have a greater tendency to adhere to the casting surface 14 than do. the crystalline strip materials.It is believed that the force which retains the strip on the casting surface may reflect the quality of the thermal contact between the strip 10 and the casting surface 14.Alternative arrangements, such as an air knife, may also be employed to separate the strip 10 from the wheel 12. The casting of a relatively high quality strip material including amorphous material, which for the purpose of this invention includes materials which are at least 25 amorphous, is feasible and practical using the apparatus and procedures described above. Understandably,the quench rates must be higher for amorphous material as compared to similar gauge crystalline strip material. Quench rates may be accelerated such as by increasing the speed of the casting surface 14, or the like. It is important to recognize that the process may be conducted in two effective modes. With the orifice passage 30 quite close to the casting surface 14 as measured between the outer lip projecting surface 38 and the casting surface 14, strip perhaps 0.025 to 0.0762mm 0.001 to 0.003 inch thick can be cast of either amorphous or crystalline materials. If the outer lip projecting surface 38 of the first side portion 32 of the curvilinear element 24 is disposed further away from the casting surface 14, and as casting surface speeds are reduced, strip perhaps 0.127 to 1.27mm 0.005 to 0.050inch thick can be cast. In this latter mode, the quench rate may be significantly lower due at least in part to the increase in the product thickness.
