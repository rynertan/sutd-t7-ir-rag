# Control device for feeding metal bars for supplying an automatic multi spindle lathe.

## Abstract
A device for controlling in sequence or at the same time the feed of metal bars into a suitable guide equipment for supplying the bars to an automatic multi spindle lathe is described. In order to connect the main control or drive means to the means causing the feeding of the bars, said device includes clutch means, the coupling and decoupling of the clutch means being caused by the rotation of said guide equipment. The portion of the clutch means which is connected to the drive means can rock around the axis of its support on the fixed frame during the coupling operation, and return spring means are provided to return said portion back in the starting position ready for the next coupling operation.
