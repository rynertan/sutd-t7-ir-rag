# Plastic card having metallic luster.

## Abstract
A colored plastic sheet is interposed between a pair of metallic luster plastic sheets having a metallic luster pigment dispersed therein and sandwiched between a pair of transpa rent plastic sheets to form a metallic luster plastic card. The metallic luster plastic card has good and homogeneous luster with the use of a relatively small amount of a metallic luster pigment without entailing an increase of the total thickness and has also a high optical transmission density required for positional recognition of the card.
