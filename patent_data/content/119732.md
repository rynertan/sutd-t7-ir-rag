# Thrust augmentor.

## Abstract
Thrust augmentation apparatus for a propulsive gas jet 11 including an outer augmentor housing 15 and an inner augmen tor housing 21 arranged coaxially with the jet 11. A minor air flow 25 is drawn into the inner passage 24 by an ejector effect, that flow 25 driving turbine vanes 28 projecting inwardly but terminat ing short of the jet 11. The vanes 28 transmit drive to fan blades 13 in the outer housing 15 to promote a thrust augmenting air flow 14. As an alternative to turbine vanes 28, gas scoops 32 may be used to develop the energy for creating the air flow 14.
