# A light diverting device.

## Abstract
A light diverting device for diverting a part of the light energy transmitted through an optical conductor rod and for taking it out of the optical conductor. The device is compris ed of a first optical conductor rod having a through hole in a radial direction, a second optical conductor rod tightly inserted into the through hole at the halfway point and firmly fixed thereon, a third optical conductor rod tightly inserted into the remaining portion of the through hole, and a fourth optical conductor rod firmly fixed on the outer circumferen tial surface of the first optical conductor rod so as to cover the inserted portion of said second optical conductor rod. Optical oil is enclosed between the inclined surface of the second optical conductor rod and the third optical conductor rod. The third optical conductor rod is constructed movably inside the through hole.
