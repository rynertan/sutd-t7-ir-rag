# Polysilane precursors containing olefinic groups for silicon carbide.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with novel polysilanes con taining olefinic groups which are prepared by reactions of halogen containing organosilane monomers or mixtures thereof with sodium metal in an appropriate solvent or mixture of solvents. Such polysilane polymers are soluble and thermoplastic, and can be directly converted to silicon carbide compositions by pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure.
