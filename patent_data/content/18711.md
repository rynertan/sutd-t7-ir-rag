# Wire wrapping tool.

## Abstract
A wire wrapping tool comprises a head 10 which is formed integrally with a shaft 11. The head 10 includes a frusto conical portion 16 which has a chordally extending portion cut away to define a cutting edge 22. A blade portion 18 is formed on the head, the blade having a slot 44 through which a wire can pass. The head also has an axially extending bore 34 into which a wire wrapping post can be inserted. In use the shaft 11 is attached to a pistol gun to rotate the head. Wire from which the insulation is to be stripped is passed over the edge 22, through the slot 44 and around a wrapping post. As the wire passes over the edge 22 a longitudinal slit is formed in the insulation which is then stripped away from the conductive core as the wire passes through the slot 44.
