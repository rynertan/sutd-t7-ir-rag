## Description
A Method of at least partially burning a Hydrocarbon andior Carbonaceous Fuel The present invention relates to a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon and or carbonaceous fuel. The growing concern about both energy conservation and atmospheric pollution demands that combustion systems be operated with maximum combustion efficiency with minimum excess air and without any emission of pollutants. The two goals, however, are not readily compatible, and indeed have proved difficult to realize. This is because any reduction in excess air to promote combustion efficiency increases smoke, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and often also oxides of nitrogen NO . The present invention relates to a system and method in which both of the foregoing objectives can be achieved, not just with relatively clean burning gaseous and light distillate fuels but also with fuel oils. The system and method basically involve staged combustion, as described below, in which improvements have been made in the design of the combustion system, and catalysts used in different stages. Conventional staged combustion involved firing of all the fuel in the first stage with a sub stoichimetric quantity of air and the injection in the second stage of sufficient air to complete combustion. Such systems have been claimed to reduce NO by ca 50 , but they usually render the x control of other pollutants, notably carbon, more difficult. According to the invention, in one aspect, fuel is partly burned in a first stage flame to yield hot substantially carbon or smoke free partly combusted fuel or first stage product, the latter being contacted with a catalyst which is active for promoting the conversion of nitrogen oxide s in the partly combusted fuel or first stage product to nitrogen, the partly combusted fuel or first stage product , after contact with the catalyst, then being at least partially burned in a second stage flame to yield hot gaseous products having a low nitrogen oxide and other pollutants content.The invention, in another aspect, comprises a method of burning a hydrocarbon and or carbonaceous fuel comprising the following steps in sequence a partially burning the fuel in a first stage flame and pro ducing a substantially carbon free or smoke free partially com busted gas phase fuel at a temperature of at least 8000C b contacting the said partially combusted gaseous phase fuel with a solid, substantially non volatile catalyst which is active for reducing the amount of nitrogen oxide s in the partially combusted fuel, the contacting being effected at a temperature of 0 at least 800 C and c at least partially burning the partially combusted fuel in a second stage flame to yield hot gaseous products of relatively low pollutant content. The temperature at which the partly combusted fuel or first stage product contacts the catalyst may be in the range of from 800 to 16000C, preferably 900 to 14000C, more preferably 10000C to 13000C, although the actual temperature will depend upon the fuel and on the amount of oxygen supplied for combustion in the first stage flame, and on the amount of nitrogen introduced with the oxygen. In order to reduce still further the nitrogen oxide content of the products, a catalyst to reduce or inhibit the formation of nitrogen oxide may be located within the flame of the first stage and or within the flame of the second stage. Preferably, a catalyst for reducing or inhibiting NO formation is located within the flames of both stage. x The catalyst for the, or each, stage, is preferably so disposed within the flame as to contact or be contacted by the hottest region of the flame usually at between 305 and 45 of the flame length from its upstream end. The catalyst employed between the stages, and the catalyst s used in the first and or second stages may be the same or different. They are preferably selected from substances consisting of or containing the elements or compounds e.g., the oxides of chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, molyb denum, tungsten, silicon, aluminium, magnesium, calcium, manganese, barium, strontium, neodymium, vanadium, alkali metals or any mixture thereof. A preferred catalyst, for cost effectiveness, iX Fe Cr, although cobalt may alternatively be favoured.The total amount of oxygen supplied in relation to the fuel may be a substoichiometric amount so that the hot gaseous products contain combustible material, or a substantially stoichiometric amount so that the hot gaseous products substantially comprise a flue gas containing no free oxygen or combustible material, or a superstoichiometric amount so that a flue gas containing free excess oxygen is produced. The part combustion in the first stage is preferably performed in any way which produces partly combusted fuel or first stage products which is free of, or susbtantially free of, carbon or smoke. The second stage part combustion is also preferably performed in a manner which produces substantially no carbon or smoke. In a preferred method of effecting the first and or second stage part combustion without the production of smoke and or carbon, a technique, herein referred to as the anti smoke technique a, is preferably employed. In the practice of the anti smoke technique, the periphery of the frame is laterally confined or bounded for at least part of its length by a surrounding combustion chamber which reduces the greatest cross sectional dimensions of at least a portion of the thus laterally confined part of the flame relative to the cross sectional dimensions that the flame would otherwise have were it not laterally confined.Preferably the cross sectional dimensions of the flame are reduced preferably where the flame cross sectional dimensions are greatest , and the dimensional reduction is preferably in the range of from 1 to 6.5 cms, more preferably 1.25 to 6.35 cms, and preferably no more than 20 of the unconfined cross sectional plane. The confinement of part of the flame by the combustion chamber causes deflection and reflection, by the hot walls of the combustion chamber, of reactive flame species that would otherwise be quenched. The recirculation of reactive flame species back into the flame to promote efficient flame reactions may be further promoted by the provision of one or more baffles of suitable shape, which are contacted by the respective flame.Preferably such baffles extend unwardly from the wall of the combustion chamber across no more than part of the cross section of the flame. The anti smoke technique is more fully described later in this specification. Preferably, the total pressure drop through the combustion chamber is no greater than 25.4 cms of water. The second stage combustion may be effected by mixing an oxygencontaining gas such as air into the hot partly combusted fuel or first stage products following contact with the NO reducing catalyst between the first and second stage combustion stages. By effecting the part combustion in the first stage flame as described, the NO production in the absence of all the catalysts which x might be employed in the practice of this invention is up to about 605 less than the NO production by single stage combustion. By employing x catalysts active for reducing the NO content of hot gases between the x first and second flame stages, and also within the first and second flame stages, a reduction in the NO concentration of over 90X to an x innocuously low concentration may be realized. The foregoing combustion may be effected at very high fuel to oxygen ratios with markedly reduced carbon or smoke formation from the first stage flame when the anti smoke technique is employed, and combustion with substantially no excess air may be effected in the second stage flame with substantially no carbon or smoke formation particularly, but not essentially, when the antismoke technique is applied to the second stage flame. When the fuel contains sulfur, operation with no, or very little, excess air reduces the formation of S03, most of the sulfur appearing in the flue gases as S02 with a correspondingly advantageous increase in the acid dew point temperature and potential improvements for additional heat recovery. The invention is now described in more detail, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagrammatic cross sectional elevation of the principal parts of an apparatus for effecting combustion or partcombustion of a fuel in accordance with the method of the invention Figure 1A is a schematic diagrammatic cross sectional elevation of a variant of the apparatus shown in Figure 1 Figure 2 is a graphieal representation of the effect of catalysts on nitrogen oxides formation at different fuel air ratios for different positions of the catalysts between the first and second stage flames Figure 3 is a graphical representation of the effect of a catalyst in the second stage flame on the NO content of the flue gas at differ x ent fuel air ratios Figure 4 is a graphical representation of the effect of a catalyst in the first stage flame on the NO content of the flue gas at different x fuel air ratios Figure 5 is a graphical representation of the effects of different types of burner on Bacharach smoke number at different fuel air ratios Figure 6 is a graphical representation of the effects of different diameters of combustion chamber on Bacharach smoke number at different fuel air ratios Figure 7 is a graphical representation of the effects of different combustion chamber lengths on Bacharach smoke number using light fuel oil at different fuel air ratios Figure 8 is a graphical representation like that of figure 7 but using gas oil as fuel Figure 9 is a graphical representation of the effects of baffles at different distances from the burner on Bacharach smoke NO for different fuel air ratios and Figure 10 is a graphical representation of the effects of baffles on the composition of the first stage flame products at different fuel air ratios. In Figures 2, 3 and 4, the ordinate shows the NO concentration in parts per million ppm by volume corrected to 3 02. Referring first to Figure 1, the schematic diagram shows apparatus, generally indicated by reference 10, comprising a burner 11 in which fuel is burned to produce a flame not indicated , a cylindrical refractory lined combustion chamber 12 which receives the flame produced by the burner at one end, and from which combustion or part combustion products are discharged at the other end to a flue pipe 13. The combustion chamber is provided with a number of viewing ports 14. Fuel, preferably a commonly used liquid fuel such as light fuel oil or gas oil, is passed into the burner 11 via injector tube 15 and air is passed into an annular air supply ring 16 via conduit 17. The air mixes with atomized oil and the latter burns in the burner 11 to produce a flame which passes to the upstream end of the combustion chamber 12.Recirculation of some of the burning gases takes place around the air ring, the recirculation serving to improve the quality of combustion. The apparatus 10 depicted is arranged for combustion of the fuel in two stages, the first stage combustion being effected under fuel rich conditions, and the partial combustion flame entering the upstream end of the combustion chamber 12 via an orifice bounded by walls 18 treated so as to contain a substantially non volatile catalyst active for reducing carbon and or smoke. In this instance the catalyst is either a mixture of iron and chromium oxides or cobalt oxide. The internal diameter of the combustion chamber 12 is chosen to be less than the natural or unconfined maximum diameter of at least a portion of the first stage flame produced by the burner 11 so that reactive flame species which promote combustion reactions are deflected and reflected back into the first stage flame by the hot walls of the combustion chamber 12 rather than being quenched, thereby enhancing the efficiency of partial combustion of the fuel in the first stage flame. The hot substantially carbon free combustible gases at a temperature in the range of from 1000 to 13000C, e.g. about 12500C, produced in the first stage flame, pass down the combustion chamber into contact with an orificed refractory member 19 extending across the chamber 12 and which is impregnated with, and coated with, substantially nonvolatile catalysts which are active for reducing the content of NO in the gases. In this instance, the catalyst is either a mixture of iron and chromium oxides or of cobalt oxide impregnated in and supported on a silica approximately 335 , alumina approximately 65 refractory material. The member 19 has a large number of orifices 20 therethrough to minimize the pressure drop.The gases after passage through the orifices 20 in the member 19 are mixed with air furnished from an air injection head 21 which is connected to a source of air by a conduit 22 and ignites to form a second stage flame not shown which may burn with insufficient, sufficient or an excess of air for complete combustion of the combustible gases. The diameter of the combustion chamber 12 is chosen to be narrower than the natural or unconfined diameter of the second stage flame so as to promote efficient part combustion with substantially no carbon or smoke formation even at low air gas ratios. The second stage flame contacts a refractory member 23 having a large number of perforations 24 therethrough which member is impregnated and coated with a substantially non volatile catalyst which is active or reducing the NO content of the flame gases and or for inhibiting the x formation of NO . The catalyst may be, for example, either a mixture of x iron and chromium oxides or cobalt oxide. The resulting hot gases, which may be reducing, neutral or oxidizing, are of low carbon or smoke content and of low NO content. x The advantageous effects caused by confining at least part of each of the first and second stage flames by the combustion chamber so as to reduce their diameters may be enhanced by providing one or more baffles which is or are contacted by one or both of the flames. Such baffle s promote recirculation of reactive species in the flame s and thereby enhance the efficiency of the flame reactions and thereby reduce the formation of NO and also reduce the formation of smoke and or carbon. x The or each baffle may take any form provided the pressure drop caused thereby is acceptably low. One such baffle 25 in the first stage flame is in the form of an annulus with a central hole. The baffle 25 is most effective for enhancing the flame reactions when it is disposed less than half way down the first stage flame from its upstream end at the exit from the burner 11, and more preferably when it is disposed about 33X of the first stage flame length from the burner exit. Reference is now made to Figure 1A in whcih all parts are the same as in Figure 1 with the following exceptions 1 the first stage flame contacts two refractory baffles 25a and 25b of annular shape and which are separated by a distance greater than the local internal diameter of the combustion chamber 12. Preferably the upstream baffle 25a is located at a distance in the range of from 25 to 335 of the length of the first stage flame from the upstream end of the flame at its exit from the burner 11 and entrance into the combustion chamber 12, and the downstream baffle 25b is located at a distance in the range of from 505 to 67 of the length of the first stage flame from its upstream end. 2 the second stage flame contacts an ellipsoidal body 23a com prised of refractory material e.g. alumina silica impregnated and coated with a substantially non volatile catalyst which is active for reducing the NO content of the flame gases and or for inhibit x ing the formation of NO . The catalyst may comprise any one or x more of the metals hereinbefore stated to be useful for the fore going purposes, but is preferably either a mixture of iron and chromium oxides or cobalt oxide for cost effectiveness.The ellipsoidal body 23a is aligned with its long axis on the axis of the combustion chamber and supported by refractory coated radial metal wires 26 preferably with at least a major portion of the body 23a less than half way down the second stage flame from its up stream end which commences at the air outlets of the air injection head 21 . In the embodiments of both figures 1 and 2, the baffle s 25 or 25a and or 25b may comprise a susbtantially non volatile catalyst active for reducing and or inhibiting the formation of NO in the flame. x The invention and expedients which may optionally be employed therewith as described with reference to Figure 1 is now described in relation to various desiderata and factors influencing them. Control of nitrogen oxides NOx x NO are reduced most effectively when catalysts are used in the x interstage zone. Less, but significant further reductions are achieved by placing catalysts within the first and second stage flames. The data below are quoted for a system where either light fuel oil or gas oil, doped with pyridine to increase the NO forming potential to the highest likely to be encountered from any petroleum fuel, was fired with a burner of the type which recirculates a part of the burnt gas into the fresh charge. The combustion chamber was lined with silica alumina refractory. It was 229 cms 90 in long and 20.3 cms 8 in. internal diameter. Catalyst in interstage zone The effect of an iron chromium oxide catalyst, coated on a perforated alumina silica refractory block 7.6 cms 3 in. thick with numerous 1.25 cms 0.5 in. diameter channels across it , when placed at different positions in the interstage zone, is shown in Figure 2 and Table 1. The catalyst markedly reduced NO . Its effect increased the x further downstream it was placed, and also as the proportion of fuel toair was increased. Table 1 also shows that cobalt oxide, while an effective catalyst, is a less effective catalyst than iron chromium oxide. TABLE 1 Influence of interstage catalyst at different distances from the primary burner, and at different air consumption rates Fuel Light fuel oil Firing rage, 11.35 l h 2.5 gall h Position of Air NO catalyst from Actual ReductionCatalyst the primary burner Stoichiometric.Fe Cr 167.6 cms 66 ins. 0.75 62 0.80 41 0.85 25 132.3 cms 52 ins. 0.75 53 0.80 34 0.85 21 101.5 cms 40 ins. 0.75 44 0.80 30 0.85 19Co 132.3 cms 52 ins. 0.75 45 0.80 30 0.85 19 Catalyst in the second stage flame An iron chromium oxide treated refractory block similar to that in the interstage zone, but only half its thickness 3.81 cms, 1.5 in. , was placed 7.6 cms 3 ins. downstream of the air injector. As shown in Figure 3, this brought about a further reduction in NO . For instance, x with the primary air 73 of the stoichiometric and the overall air input stoichiometric, the second stage catalyst reduced NO from 140 ppm to 120 ppm a 145 reduction. A different design of catalyst support in the form of an elongated ellipsoid with ca 15 25 cms 6 ins. and 5.08 cms 2 ins. axes, supported ca 5.08 cms 2 ins. downstream from the burner air injector 21 of Fig. 1 along the central axis produced virtually the same effect as the perforated block catalyst. Catalyst in the first stage flame The use of iron chromium catalyst in the first stage flame fired by light fuel oil at a rate of 11.35 litres per hour 2.5 Imperial gallons per hour , in a manner similar to that in the second stage flame, substantially reduced NO Figure 4 . For instance, whilst the inter x stage catalyst, with primary air 745 of stoichiometric, reduced NO from 275 ppm to 115 ppm 58X reduction the additional first stage catalyst reduced NO to 70 ppm 75 reduction . At this primary air level, second stage combustion with a catalyst therein, produced 100 ppm of NO at an overall stoichiometry of 1.0. A conventional combustion system, with the high nitrogen content fuel used, would generate well over 1000 ppm of NO. Control of sulphur trioxide Formation of sulphur trioxide from any sulphur impurity in the flame is highly undesirable because of its corrosive nature. Combustion according to the invention greatly reduces S03 formation. For instance, whereas in a conventional system, operating at 2.1X excess oxygen, light fuel oil with 2.5 sulphur content gave rise to 44 ppm of SO3 the modified combustion system, without staging or the use of catalysts, produced 34 ppm of sulphur trioxide 23 reduction at the same stoichiometry. Staging reduced sulphur trioxide from 34 ppm to 26 ppm. The use of the inter stage catalyst reduced it to 20 ppm, and that of the first and second stage catalysts to 18 ppm.Since, unlike the conventional system, staged combustion can be dperated smo free under stoichiometric conditions, this further greatly reduces sulphur trioxide to only 5 ppm that is ca 90 overall reduction. Control of smoke, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and unburned hydrocarbons in the second stage For complete combustion of smoke, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and unburned hydrocarbons in the second stage, without any excess air, and in a limited space, thorough mixing of the products of the first stage with the added air should be promoted. The neeessary expedients for such mixing are essentially the same as those employed for the first stage. Using the same relatively narrow combustion chamber with baffles in the same manner as in the first stage, satisfactory combustion ws successfully effected with stoichiometric air on an overall basis.Smoke emission in the flue gas from the second stage was not greater than 3 Bacharach Number that is, no smoke was visible in the stack gas. Carbon monoxide, hydrogen and unburned hydrocarbons were absent. And, as previously stated, both NO and sulphur trioxide had been x reduced by about 90 . The foregoing description is given to illustrate the invention and is not limitative of its scope. Reducing Carbon and or Smoke Formation Using the anti smoke technique In the following description and related Figures 5 to 10 of the drawings there is now described a combustion technique which may be employed with the method of the invention in order to reduce still further the amount of pollutant in the gas products of part ot full combustion and to improve the efficiency of utilization of the fuel. As disclosed above, the combustion technique comprises confining a portion of the first stage flame and or the second stage flame by means of a laterally bounding combustion chamber so that cross sectional dimensions of the flame s are reduced relative to the cross sectional dimensions of the flame s , in the same cross sectional planes, when the flame s are not laterally bounded or confined. It is preferred that the greatest natural or unconfined crosssectional dimensions e.g. diameter of the flame be reduced by containment in the combustion chamber by from 1.25 cms or thereabouts to 6.3 cms or thereabouts, more preferably from 1.8 cms or thereabouts to 5.1 cms or thereabouts. In many cases, the reduction of the flames greatest cross sectional dimensions may suitably be from c.2.5 cms c.1.O inch or thereabouts to c.3.8 cms c.1.5 inches or thereabouts. It is preferred that the cross sectional dimension should not be reduced by more than 25 . At least 50 of the natural length of the flame is preferably contained or confined by the combustion chamber and more preferably 605 or more e.g. 70X . Better improvements in combustion may be realized when the combustion chamber laterally confines the upstream part towards the burner rather than the downstream part of the flame. The combustion chamber may confine the first stage flame starting from a.position either at the exit from the burner or spaced downstream therefrom. It may be convenient to attach the combustion chamber to the burner or burner support. The combustion chamber may contain at least one internal fixed baffle for promoting recirculation of reactive species in the flame.The, or each, baffle may have any convenient form such as a refractory ring or annulus in the case of cylindrical combustion chambers as exemplified by baffle 25, Figure 1, extending inwardly from the periphery at the internal wall. The baffle s should cause the smallest pressure drop which is economically acceptable for the realized improvement in combustion. For most cases, a pressure drop of up to 5 cms c.2.0 inches water will be acceptable. With one baffle, the pressure drop will usually tend to be about 2.5 cms c.1.0 inch water in most cases. When there are two or more baffles, they should be separated by a distance equal to at least the cross sectional dimension e.g. diameter or equivalent of the combustion chamber. The location of the baffle s in the flame tends to influence the improvement in combustion. With one baffle, the baffle should be located preferably less than half way down the total length of the flame from the burner, e.g. about 33X of the total flame length from the burner. When two baffles are employed, it is preferred that the upstream baffle is located from 25 to 33X of the length of the flame downstream of the base of the flame, e.g. at the burner in the case of the first stage flame, and the downstream baffle from 505 to 67 of the flame length from the flame base. With three baffles, the location of the upstream and middle baffles is preferably in the same range as for two baffles, the downstream baffle being located within the flame at any distance downstream of the middle baffle but separated therefrom by a distance no smaller than the internal diameter or its equivalent of the combustion chamber. While the combustion chamber tends to increase the length of the flame, each baffle reduces the flame length so that a shorter combustion chamber can be used to effect the same improvement in combustion. One baffle alone can reduce the flame length by up to 25, e.g. 15 to 20 , while three baffles can reduce the flame length by up to 505. The technique is particularly useful in reducing the amount of air or other oxygen containing gas required to eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level, smoke or carbon, so that it is possible to burn relatively heavy fuel oils and solid fuels substoichiometrically to produce hot, clean reducing gas relatively efficiently. The technique may also be employed with lighter fuels, e.g. naphthas up to liquefied petroleum gas containing more than 2 of butane,and may also be employed in the combustion of any of the foregoing fuels to produce a substantially smokeand carbon free hot neutral i.e. neither oxidizing nor reducing gas useful in processes requiring inert gas blanketting and in power generation.With regard to the latter, the absence of excess air tends to reduce the formation of SO3 from sulphur in the fuel whereby greater heat recovery may be effected without the risk of sulphuric acid corrosion. Moreover, the production of nitrogen oxides also tends to be reduced in the substantial absence of excess air. The technique will now be described in connection with the production of hot, clean, reducing gases. Hot reducing atmospheres are extensively generated for heat treatment of metals. Their far wider use in future has been forecast for injection into the bosh zone of blast furnaces and eventually for the production of raw steel by direct reduction of iron ore. Currently reducing atmospheres are generated mostly by partial combustion of gaseous fuels natural gas, town gas, propane butane in the presence of a catalyst. The operation requires a careful control of fuel and catalyst quality and maintenance of the optimum operating conditions to ensure prevention of carbon formation and deposition on the catalyst. Much work has already been carried out on improved designs for minimizing carbon formation. What has now been discovered is that a far greater reduction in carbon forming tendency can be achieved by careful design of the combustion chamber. With a suitably designed combustion chamber, in conjunction with a suitable burner, a clean, highly reducing atmosphere can be generated from, e.g., liquid fuels of wide compositional range, without the aid of a catalyst. In the past, improvements in combustion have arisen from burner modifications which have been chiefly based on promoting better mixing of the fuel and air feed and or on the injection into the fuel air feed of water steam, products of combustion. In contrast, it has been discovered that combustion chamber modifications that increase mixing and recirculation of the flame reactants and products in the flame itself can greatly reduce carbon formation.The combustion chamber design parameters which promote mixing and recirculation have been systematically investigated, and it has been found that these entail optimum choice of combustion chamber diameter or equivalent cross sectional dimension optimum choice of chamber length provision of suitable baffles in the chamber These features are easy to incorporate and unlike burner modifications, do not require any complex and expensive subsidiary control devices. The effect of combustion chamber modifications was investigated with a burner which recirculates a part of the combustion products into the fuel air feed described with reference to Figure 1. This burner produces considerably less carbon than a typical medium pressure air atomizing burner. Comparative results with this burner firing into a refractory lined combustion chamber of conventional size 61 cms 34 inches diameter and 127 cms 50 inches long are shown in Figure 5, wherein curve A shows the performance of the medium pressure air atomizing burner, and curve B the performance of the exhaust gas recirculation burner. Both burners burned light fuel oil at a rate of 9.09 l h 2 gallons per hour . The influence of different parameters on the efficiency of combustion was investigated, as described below. Influence of Combustion Chamber Diameter Using the exhaust gas recirculation burner described with reference to Figure 1, its smoke emission performance in the 61 cms internal diameter combustion chamber was compared with that in a 20.3 cms 8 ins. internal diameter chamber of the same length. The narrower diameter chosen was about 2.5 cms 1 in. smaller than the flame diameter at its widest. The results Figure 6 show the markedly less carbon forming tendency in the narrower chamber curve B compared with the carbon forming tendency in the wider chamber curve A . The results were obtained with the same light fuel oil and fuel feed rate 9.09 litres hour as used in the tests of Figure 5. Studies were next carried out in a still narrower 12.7 cms 5 ins. internal diameter chamber. But now the flame length has become far too long to effect complete combustion within the 127 cms 50 ins. long chamber. Influence of Combustion Chamber Length With the 20.3 cms 8 ins. internal diameter chamber, the influence of increasing the length of the combustion chamber from 127 cms 50 ins. to 190 cms 75 ins. and then 229 cms 90 ins. is shown in Figure 7 for light fuel oil and in Figure 8 for gas oil, at a fuel burning rate of about 11.37 litres hour 2.5 gallons hour . In Figure 7, curve A shows the performance using the 127 cms long combustion chamber, curve B that of the 190 cms long chamber and curve C the performance of the 229 cms long chamber. It is seen that an increase in length reduces the carbon forming tendency, although the effect is less marked than that of reducing the diameter. Influence of Baffles In the 20.3 cms 8 ins. diameter 127 cms 50 ins. long combustion chamber, three annular refractory baffles each like baffle 25 of Figure 1, each with 6.25 cms hole in the centre, were spaced in the combustion chamber at 40.6 cms 16 ins. , 76.2 cms 30 ins. and 122 cms 48 ins. from the burner. The burner consumed 11.37 litres hour 2.5 gallons hour of gas oil. These baffles, as shown by curve B of Figure 9, considerably reduced carbon formation relative to the non baffledchamber of curve A. The effect, in fact, is greater than that of increasing the length of the flame by confinement in a narrow combustion chamber and thus provides an inexpensive way of reducing carbon forming tendency even with short combustion chambers. In general, therefore, carbon formation can be markedly reduced by reducing the chamber diameter or equivalent cross sectional dimension , increasing the chamber length and by providing baffles in the chamber.Of the three factors, the effect of diameter is most marked. However, care has to be taken that the diameter is not reduced excessively preferably by not more than 2.5 to 5.1 cms one 2 inches , or by more than 25 of that of the unrestricted unconfined flame, since otherwise the resulting excessive inhibition of flame reactions and aerodynamic factors can necessitate the use of an impracticably long combustion chamber for completion of the flame processes. For a given length constraint, carbon formation can be considerably reduced by the insertion of baffles in the chamber. Again, care is necessary that these are not placed so closely as to inhibit the combustion processes to any significant extent.In the system described here by way of example, the position and size of baffles and the diameter of the chamber are particularly suited for maintaining a stable flame even with barely 50 of the stoichiometric air. In conventional systems stable flames are usually hard to maintain with air less than 70 of the stoichiometric. Successful maintenance of flame process with air barely 505 of the stoichiometric amount produces a highly reducing atmosphere. The amounts of CO and H2 that are formed, along with CO2, are shown in Figure 10 for gas oil fired at a rate of 11.37 litres hour 2.5 Imperial gallons hour into the 20.3 cms 8 ins. diameter, 127 cms 50 ins. long chamber fitted with 3 baffles curve B compared with the inferior reducing gas quality produced in the absence of baffles curve A . For some applications it is desirable to generate even greater amounts of CO and H2 and correspondingly less of C02 and H20. This can be readily achieved by passing the product gas through a bed of incandescent coal in accordance with well known practice. In the practice of the invention, the pressure drop caused by the combustion chamber, interstage catalyst and its support , second stage air injector, together with any baffles to be contacted by one or both stage flames should be sufficiently low not to necessitate any significant modification to the burner supplying the flame to the combustion chamber. Preferably, the combustion chamber should not cause a pressure drop greater than 25.5 cms H20 More preferably, the pressure drop should be less than 12.25 cms water, and may be in the range of from 2 to 10 cms water, e.g. about 6 cms water.
