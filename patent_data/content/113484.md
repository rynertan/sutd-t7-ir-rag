## Description
Novel 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers and photographic elements containing them. The present invention relates to novel 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers, to the use thereof in the production of photographic colour images, and to photographic elements containing such couplers. It is known that for the production of a photographic colour image in a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, the exposed silver halide is developed to a silver image by means of an aromatic primary amino compound in the presence of a coupler, which reacts with the oxidized developing substance to form a dye at the areas corresponding to the silver image. In subtractive three colour photography use is made of a light sensitive photographic colour element comprising a support, red sensitized, green sensitized, and blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layers, wherein upon colour development using appropriate couplers, cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images are formed in said layers, respectively. The red sensitized silver halide emulsion layers usually contains cyan forming couplers of the phenol or naphthol type. The reaction between the coupler and the oxidized colour developing substance proceeds at the active site of the coupler.Couplers having a hydrogen atom at the active site are 4 equivalent couplers, which need 4 mol of exposed silver halide to form but 1 mol of dye. Couplers, however, which at their active site have a group that can be eliminated, are called 2 equivalent couplers. The eliminable group is generally known as coupling off group. The latter couplers require only 2 mol of exposed silver halide to form 1 mol of dye. This offers the great advantage that the amount of silver halide in the light sensitive layer can be reduced, which may result in thinner light sensitive layers and films. As a consequence of this reduction in thickness the processing time of these layers and films is shortened. A large variety of coupling off groups are known already, among which the substituted alkoxy groups constitute an interesting class.In particular the published Japanese Patent Application 50 120334 describes couplers having ,ss fluorinated ethoxy coupling off groups. 2 Equivalent couplers he important advantages as described above, though many of the known 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers havewserious disadvantages such as their high cost of synthesis, an unsatisfactory photographic reactivity, an insufficient dispersibility, and or a poor stability. The complex and or lengthy reaction sequence leading to many known couplers has, of course, a bearing on their cost and consequently on the total cost of the light sensitive element containing them. An often encountered difficulty with water insoluble 2 equivalent couplers is that they react very slowly with the oxidized colour developing agent. A frequently occurring problem caused by water insoluble couplers is that the shelf life of dispersions of such couplers may be rather restricted. Dispersions of water insoluble couplers, after having been prepared in bulk for economic reasons, need to be stored for a given time and are used later on batch wise in the production of colour elements. However, most of the customarily used dispersions of couplers, are prepared with the aid of a wetting agent and an oil former in an aqueous colloid medium e.g. a gelatin solution and thus need to be stored in cooling chambers, which results in chilling. As a consequence, the chilled dispersions have to be remelted before addition to the silver halide emulsion. This cold storage and the remelting require much energy spending and technical background.Other techniques e.g. those described in the BritishPatent Specification 1,297,947 allow to make dispersions of water insoluble couplers in water, these dispersions being stored at room temperature. However, few couplers can be dispersed successfully according to this interesting technique. Another problem is that certain couplers, however interesting other characteristics they may have, are insufficiently stable. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel 2 equivalent cyan fonning couplers, which have improved properties and at the same time are very interesting from an economical standpoint. Another object is to provide photographic elements containing said novel 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers. A further object is to provide photographic multilayer colour elements containing said novel 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers. Another object of the invention is to produce a photographic colour image by development of a photographic multilayer colour element containing said novel 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers. Other objects of the invention will become apparent from the disclosure hereinafter. The above objects are accomplished with the aid of novel 2 equivalent fluorine containing cyan forming couplers, which can be synthesized in a very economic way with high yields, have a high photographic reactivity as well as a high stability, and can be dispersed successfully in water.

Moreover, the reaction sequence leading to the couplers of the present invention offers high yields. The novel 2 equivalent couplers of the present invention can be dispersed successfully in water. Aqueous dispersions of the couplers of the invention can be stored for long periods in normal conditions, which means that they have not to be kept in special cooling rooms.The stability of the aqueous dispersions of couplers according to he present invention has proven to be excellent. The afore mentioned advantages of the aqueous dispersions of the couplers of the present invention permit the coating of layers containing small amounts of hydrophilic colloid, preferably gelatin. As a consequence of the reduced amount of colloid in the light sensitive layers, the sharpness of the dye images formed therein is improved. It has been established also that the sensitometric results obtained with photographic elements comprising couplers according to the present invention are at least as good as those obtained with photographic elements comprising known couplers. The term non diffusing used herein with respect to couplers has the meaning commonly applied to the term in photography and means that in any practical application migration or wandering of such non diffusing coupler compound through organic colloid layers such as gelatin layers in an alkaline medium, in the photographic elements of the invention is substantially unexisting. For the preparation of a photographic multilayer colour element the dispersions of the couplers for each of the colour separation images are usually incorporated into the coating composition of the differently sensitized silver halide emulsion layers. Yet, the couplers can also be added to the coating composition of non light sensitive colloid layers that are in water permeable relationship with the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers. During the preparation of the light sensitive colour element the non diffusing cyan forming couplers corresponding to the above general formulae can be incorporated into the coating composition of the silver halide emulsion layer or other colloid layers in water permeable relationship therewith according to any technique known by those skilled in the art for incorporating photographic ingredients, more particularly colour couplers, into colloid compositions. The cyan forming couplers according to the present invention can be dispersed, occasionally in the presence of a wetting or dispersing agent, in a hydrophilic composition constituting or forming part of the binding agent of the colloid layer. Very suitable wetting agents that can be used to disperse the cyan forming couplers of the invention are the fluorine containing surface active agents of U.S.Patent Specification no. 4,292,402. For more details about particularly suitable techniques that can be employed for incorporating the couplers of the invention into a hydrophilic colloid layer of a photographic element there can be referred to U.K.Patent Specifications 791,219 1,098,594 1,099,414 1,099,415 1,099,416 1,099,417 1,199,570 1,218,190 1,297,947, to theU.S. Patent Specifications 2,269,158 2,284,887 2,304,939 2,304,940 2,322,027, to the French Patent Specification 1,555,663, and to the Belgian Patent Specification 722,026. Another technique for incorporating colour couplers is via polymeric latices as described in the published German PatentApplications DE OS 2,541,230 and 2,541,274. The cyan forming couplers according to the present invention can be used in conjunction with various kinds of photographic emulsions. Various silver salts can be used as the light sensitive salt. For instance silver bromide, silver iodide, silver chloride or mixed silver halides such as silver chlorobromide, silver bromoiodide, and silver chlorobromoiodide can be employed. The couplers can be used in emulsions of the mixed packet type as described in the U.S. PatentSpecification 2,698,794, or emulsions of the mixed grain type as described in the U.S. Patent Specification 2,592,243. The colour couplers can be used with emulsions wherein latent images are formed predominantly at the surface of the silver halide crystal or with emulsions wherein latent images are formed predominantly inside the silver halide crystal. The hydrophilic colloid used as the binder for the silver halide can be e.g. gelatin, colloidal albumin,, zein, casein, a cellulose derivative, a synthetic hydrophilic colloid such as polyvinyl alcohol or poly N vinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, compatible mixtures of two or more of these colloids can be employed for dispersing the silver halide. The light sensitive silver halide emulsions used in the manufacture of a photographic element according to the present invention can be sensitized chemically as well as optically. They can be sensitized chemically by carrying out the ripening in the presence of small amounts of sulphur containing compounds such as allyl thiocyanate, allyl thiourea, or sodium thiosulphate. The emulsions can also be sensitized by means of reducing agents e.g. tin compounds as described in the French Patent Specification 1,146,955 and in the Belgian Patent Specification 568,687, imino aminomethane sulphinic acid compounds as described in U.K. Patent Specification 789,823 and small amounts of noble metal compounds such as gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, ruthenium, and rhodium compounds. They can be sensitized optically by means of cyanine and merocyanine dyes. The said emulsions can also comprise compounds that sensitize the emulsions by development acceleration e.g. compounds of the polyoxyalkylene type such as alkylene oxide condensation products as described i.a. in U.S. Patent Specifications 2,531,832, 2,533,990, and 4,292,400 in U.K. Patent Specifications 920,637 940,051 945,340 991,608 and 1,091,705 and onium derivatives of amino N oxides as described in U.K.Patent Specification 1,121,696. Further, the emulsions may comprise stabilizers e.g. heterocyclic nitrogen containing thioxo compounds such as benzothiazoline 2 thione and l phenyl 2 tetrazoline 5 thione and compounds of the hydroxytriazolopyrimidine type. They can also be stabilized with mercury compounds such as the mercury compounds described in BelgianPatent Specifications 524,121 677,337, and in the U.K. PatentSpecification 1,173,609. The light sensitive emulsions containing the couplers of the present invention may also comprise any other kind of ingredient such as those described for such emulsions in Research Disclosure no.17643 of December 1978, in particular development inhibitor releasing compounds and competing couplers. Such compounds and couplers can be incorporated in layers in water permeable relationship with the emulsion layers containing the couplers of the present invention. The non diffusing cyan forming couplers of the present invention are usually incorporated into a red sensitized silver halide emulsion of the photographic multilayer colour element. Such photographic multilayer colour element usually comprises the cyan forming coupler in a red sensitized silver halide emulsion layer s , the magenta forming coupler in a green sensitized silver halide emulsion layer s , and the yellow forming coupler in a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer s . The emulsions can be coated on a wide variety of photographic emulsion supports. Typical supports include cellulose ester film, e.g. cellulose triacetate film, polyvinylacetal film, polystyrene film, polyethylene terephthalate film and related films or resinous materials, as well as paper or coated paper e.g. polyethylene coated paper, and glass. For the production of photographic colour images according to the present invention an exposed silver halide emulsion layer is developed with an aromatic primary amino developing agent in the presence of a cyan forming coupler according to the present invention. All colour developing agents capable of forming a cyan indoaniline dye with the cyan forming couplers according to the invention, can be utilized as developers. Suitable developing agents are aromatic compounds in particular p phenylenediamine and derivatives thereof, e.g.N,N dialkyl p phenylenediamines,N,N dialkyl N sulphomethyl p phenylenediamines,N,N dialkyl N carboxymethyl p phenylenediamines, the sulphonamidosubstituted p phenylenediamines disclosed in US P 2,548,574 and other substituted p phenylenediamines disclosed in US P 2,566,271. Typical examples of suitable p phenylenediamines are N,N diethylp phenylenediamine, 2 amino 5 diethylaminotoluene, N butyl N sulphobutyl p phenylenediamine, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N ss methylsulphonami do ethyl aminotoluene, N ethyl N I3 hydroxyethyl p phenylenediamine, etc. These developing agents are often used in their salt form e.g.as hydrochloride or sulphate. The following examples illustrate the present invention. Example 1 The dispersability of the 2 equivalent cyan forming couplers comprising an ,o fluorinated alkoxy coupling off group according to the present invention was compared with that of analogous cyan forming couplers differing from the couplers of the present invention only in that they comprise known coupling off groups. It was therefore tried to make aqueous dispersions of several of the non diffusing cyan forming couplers according to the invention and equally of several analogous non diffusing cyan forming couplers comprising known coupling off groups according to the following procedure. 2 g of non diffusing cyan forming coupler was dissolved in 10 ml of ethyl acetate at room temperature. The resulting solution was added in 10 s to a solution consisting of 16 ml of demineralized water and 2 ml of a 10 aqueous solution of decyl benzene sulphonic acid sodium salt in a high speed stirrer. The mixture was stirred for 5 min to disperse the coupler in the aqueous medium, if at all possible. The ethyl acetate was then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure 27 to 53 kPa at 650C. Next, demineralized water was added to a reach a total volume of 20 ml. If succeeded, a 10 aqueous dispersion of coupler was thus obtained, which was fully suited for admixture with the usual light sensitive silver halide gelatin emulsions. Whenever an aqueous dispersion was obtained, the average size of the dispersed coupler particles was determined with the COULTER registered trade mark NANO SIZER marketed by Coulter ElectronicsLtd., Coldharbour Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, AL 54 UN, UnitedKingdom. The measuring principles used in this instrument are those ofBrownian Motion and autocorrelation spectroscopy of scattered laser light. The frequency of this Brownian Motion is inversely related to particle size. The instrument also computes a polydispersity index, which is a measure of the width of the size distribution. For instance an index of O or 1 would describe an essentially monosized distribution, whereas 8 or 9 would describe a wide range distribution. The stability of the aqueous dispersions of coupler was checked after long periods of storage 48 h 7 days and 28 days at 400C. Whenever crystallization appeared to be inexisting after these long periods of storage, the average size of the still dispersed coupler particles and the polydispersity index were determined again as described hereinbefore. The results of these measurements are listed in the following table 2 for cyan forming phenol couplers and table 3 for cyan forming naphthol couplers . The 5 tested phenol couplers all corresponded to the following structural formula EMI22.1 wherein X represents hydrogen, chloro, and methoxy for the 3 comparison phenol couplers A, B, and C respectively as well as 2 chloro l , 1,2 trifluoroethoxy and 1,1,2,3,3,3 hexafluoropropoxy for the couplers 3 and 5 according to the invention respectively .

A dispersion of each of the cyan forming couplers listed in table 4 hereinafter was prepared as described in example I hereinbefore. Each of the resulting dispersions was added to a red sensitized silver halide emulsion. After neutralization of each of the emulsions and addition thereto of the usual additives such as stabilizing agents e.g. 5 methyl 7 hydroxy s triazolo l ,5 a pyrimidine, wetting agents, and hardening agents the necessary amount of distilled water to obtain 575 g of emulsion was added. Each of the emulsions was coated on film support in a ratio of 150 g per sq.m. Each emulsion layer was dried and covered with a gelatin antistress layer. The dried light sensitive elements were exposed in a Herrnfeld sensitometer for 1 20th second through a continuous wedge with a constant of 0.30. The exposed elements were colour developed for 10 min at 240C with a developer containing as developing agent 2 amino 5 diethyl amino toluene hydrochloride CD 2 , then bleached, fixed, and washed in the conventional way. Table 4 shows the results of speed, gradation and maximum density Dmax obtained with both processed elements, the first of which comprising 2 perfluorobutyroylamino 4 chloro 5 di n octyloxyisopropoxycarbonamido phenol as comparison coupler H, the second element comprising the phenol coupler 7 according to the present invention.

Table 5 shows the results of speed, gradation and maximum density obtained with the 6 processed elements, all of them comprising a different cyan forming 2 N di tert pentylphenoxybutyl carbamoylnaphthol coupler, the difference between these couplers residing only in their coupling off group.
