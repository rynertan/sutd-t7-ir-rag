# Recording and or reproducing apparatus with rotary head for recording and reproducing signals in a magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
A recording and or reproducing apparatus for a magnetic tape cassette has a rotary head 6 mounted on the recording and or reproducing apparatus and a loading mechanism for ex tracting a length of magnetic tape from a magnetic tape cas sette and moving the length of magnetic tape to various posi tions corresponding to various operation modes of the record ing and reproducing apparatus. The loading mechanism in cludes first 23 and second 24 movable members respectively movable along predetermined first 16 and sec ond 17 paths. The rotary head 6 is mounted in such a man ner that the axis of the rotary head lies oblique to a vertical axis in such a manner that first ends of the first 16 and second 17 paths lie adjacent the rotary head 6 in a plane extending through the uppermost point 6U and the lowermost point 6L of the top surface of the rotary head 6 and perpendicular to the medial plane of the magnetic tape and second ends of the first 16 and second 17 paths are remote from the rotary head 6 and proximal to the first means, whereby the differ ence between the lengths of the first and second paths can be minimized. Preferably, the rotary head 6 is mounted in such a manner that the axis of the rotary head means lies oblique to the vertical axis such that the plane extending through the up permost point 6U and the lowermost point 6L of the top sur face of the rotary head 6 lies oblique to a reference line A A connecting the reel axes 12, 13 of a pair of tape reels in the magnetic tape cassette 130 .
