# An improved process for the manufacture of p hydroxybenzyl cyanide.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of p hydroxybenzyl cyanide by the reaction of p hydroxybenzyl alcohol with an alkali metal cyanide, by carrying out the pro cess in the presence of an alkyl formate, especially n propyl formate. The cyanide product is a valuable intermediate for the preparation of the Î² adrenergic blocking agent atenolol.
