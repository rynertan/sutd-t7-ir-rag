## Description
The present invention relates to prolonged sustained release preparations. More particularly, it relates to prolonged sustained release preparations in the form of bar like or needle like shaped preparations suitable for injection or injection like administration, which comprise as an active ingredient a prostaglandin, prostacyclin, biohormone, interferon, interleukins or tumor necrosis factor in admixture with one or more of pharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable carriers which can be implanted into the body. It is known that a medicament can be prepared in such a form that the medicament is embraced within a polymer, for example a polyethylene glycol diacrylate polymer, and is implanted into the body in order to sustain the release of the medicament. However, such a technique has various drawbacks in that the polymer is not biodegradable and hence it must be removed somehow after administration and in that the implantation must be done by operation with troublesome treatment. Nevertheless, it has been desired to create a sustained release preparation for many medicaments. It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved sustained release preparation for prostaglandins, prostacyclins, biohormones, interferons, interleukins or tumor necrosis factors. Another object of the invention is to provide a long i.e. prolonged sustained release preparation in the form of bar like or needle like shaped preparations which can be injected or implanted into the body and can release the active ingredient and can maintain the desired level of the active ingredient in blood or in lesional region for a long period of time. A further object of the invention is to provide a device for administering a sustained release preparation in the form of a needle like or bar like shape. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. These objects have been achieved by the surprising finding that the desired sustained release preparation can be obtained by admixing the active ingredient with a specific biodegradable carrier and that the formed product of the preparation in the form of a bar like or needle like shape is very useful for injection or for implanting into the body and shows excellent effects with respect to release sustaining of the active ingredient. The sustained release preparations of the present invention are in the form of a bar like or needle like shaped preparation, which comprises i a prostaglandin, prostacyclin, biohormone, interferon, interleukins or a tumor necrosis factor in admixture with ii one or more pharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable carriers which can be absorbed or be subject to enzymolysis in the body and can be implanted within the body, such as proteins e.g. collagen, gelatin, albumin , polysaccharides e.g. chitin , or high molecular compounds e.g. polylactic acid, polyglutamic acid . The sustained release preparation is formed in a bar like or needle like shape and can be injected or implanted into the body. The active ingredient used in the present invention includes also 4 carbamoyl imidazolium 5 oleate other name 4 carbamoyl 5 hydroxy imidazole or SM 108 or a salt or a hydrate thereof, known as a new antitumor agent and effective as a metabolic antagonist in purine de novo synthesis. Interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factors are somewhat different to each other, but are common in that they have very similar molecular weights and are glycoproteins or proteins and have similar pharmacological and physico chemical properties as α interferon as will be shown in experiments hereinafter. Prostaglandins and prostacyclines are different to each other, but they have in common that they have similar molecular weights as SM 108, as will be shown in experiments hereinafter. All of these compounds are prepared for the desired excellent sustained release preparation of the present invention. The biodegradable carrier used in the present invention means a carrier which can easily be absorbed or be subject to enzymolysis in the body and can be implanted into the body. Suitable examples of the biodegradable carrier are proteins such as collagen, gelatin, albumin polysaccharides such as chitins and synthetic high molecular compounds such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyglutamic acid, or the like. These substances can be used alone or in any combination of two or more thereof, but for reasons of safety and easy handling, collagen or gelatin or a mixture thereof are preferable. Collagen is a main protein of the connective tissue of animals and has less antigenicity, and hence, has widely been used as a safe operation yarn in various medical operations. The collagen may be an atelocollagen having far less antigenicity which is obtained by removing the telopeptide region by treating collagen with an enzyme e.g. pepsin in order to make it safer. Gelatin is a protein derived from collagen. Gelatin is a high molecular weight amphoteric electrolyte which has less antigenicity and convertibility properties between sol and gel forms and is low in costs, and hence it has already been accepted as a safe substance for medical use. The preparation of the present invention contains the active ingredient in an amount of in which the active ingredient is usually used. For example, interferon is usually contained in an amount of 10⁴ to 10⁹ IU, preferably 10⁵ to 5 x 10⁸ IU per dosage unit, and SM 108 or a salt or hydrate thereof is usually contained in an amount of 1 mg to 2 g, preferably 10 mg to 1 g per dosage unit. Besides, the ratio of the medicament and the carrier is not specified, but for example, interferon is preferably incorporated in an amount of 10³ to 10⁸ IU per 1 mg of the carrier, and SM 108 is preferably incorporated in an amount of 0.01 to 1 mg per 1 mg of the carrier. The sustained release preparation of the present invention can be prepared by the following method. The active ingredient or an aqueous solution thereof is mixed with a biodegradable carrier or an aqueous solution thereof, and the mixture is homogeneously mixed by stirring while preventing occurrence of foam as much as possible. The resulting mixture is optionally concentrated at a low temperature and further optionally spray dried or lyophilized. In the preparation, there may optionally be incorporated conventional pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as stabilizers, preservatives, local anesthetic agents, and some agents for aiding formability into special shapes of preparations or for release sustaining of the active ingredient. These additives are not specified, but suitable examples of the agents for aiding formability are methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, glycolic acid lactic acid copolymer, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or the like. Suitable examples of the agents for aiding release sustaining of the active ingredient are cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, calcium phosphate, lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer, corn starch, rice starch, potato starch, cellulose, arginates, or the like. The preparation thus obtained is pulverized to powders under cooling with dry ice or liquid nitrogen, or by any other conventional pulverization method. The powder is compressed together with other additives if specific shapes should be formed, such as a needle like or fine bar like shaped preparations diameter about 0.5 mm 1.5 mm, length about 5 mm 15 mm , which can be inserted into a body with a forceps needle for fiberscope, an indwelling needle, or other appropriate administration device as mentioned hereinafter. Alternatively, the powdery preparation is previously entered into a mold, followed by concentrating at a low temperature or by lyophilizing to compress and form a needle like or a fine bar like shaped preparation. All steps for preparing the desired sustained release preparations are carried out under sterilized conditions because the preparations are used as an injection or for implanting into a body. The long sustained release preparation of the present invention can be administered to the patients by various methods, for example, by inserting a fine tube into the body at the desired region with an appropriate means, such as a catheter and then inserting the needle like shaped preparation of the present invention by passing through inside the fine tube, or by inserting the preparation of the present invention directly into the body at the lesional region by means of forceps needles of a fiberscope. The present invention provides also an improved device for administering the needle like or bar like shaped preparations of the present invention. The device for administration of the sustained release preparation and the mode of their administration are explained referring to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a device for administering the preparation of the present invention which comprises a fine tube and an inner needle. Fig. 2 is an embodiment showing a state where the device as shown in Fig. 1 is stabbed into the body. Fig. 3 is an embodiment showing a state where a needle like shaped solid preparation is administered into the body by the device as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of a needle for administering a needle like shaped solid preparation of the present invention wherein the solid preparation is held in the needle. Fig. 5 is an embodiment showing a state where the needle like shaped solid preparation is administered into the body with the administration needle as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is an embodiment of a needle for administering a needle like shaped solid preparation of the present invention which is provided with a removable cover for preventing the solid preparation contained therein from falling down. Fig. 7 is a graph showing the relation between the blood level of an active ingredient and the time elapsed after intramuscular administration of the preparation in rabbits. Fig. 8 is a graph showing the rate of releasing of the active ingredient from the needle like shaped sustained release preparation of the present invention. The device for administering a needle like shaped preparation comprises i a fine tube and ii an inner needle which can freely slide within the fine tube. The fine tube in the above device is a tube having an inner diameter of 0.5 to 5 mm which can be inserted partly into a body. The length of the tube is not specified but may be any size convenient for injection, and is usually in the range of 2 cm to 10 cm. The material for preparing the tube may be any kind of material compatible with the body. The inner needle has a sharp tip as shown in the accompanying Fig. 1 and has an outer diameter as the same as or smaller than the inner diameter of the above tube. The device for administering a needle like shaped preparation is usually used with being held in a holding device 6 , but may be used with being held at the tip of forceps needle of fiberscope. The administration manner of the needle like shaped preparation with the above device is explained in more detail below. Firstly, the inner needle 1 is stabbed into a portion of the body 2 and simultaneously the fine tube 3 is inserted into the body by sliding its inner wall along the outer wall of the inner needle 1 cf. the accompanying Fig. 2 . Thereafter, the inner needle 1 is pulling off, and then the needle like shaped preparation 4 is inserted into the body by passing through the inner slit of the fine tube 3 , and finally the fine tube is taken off. The insertion of the needle like shaped preparation into the body is usually carried out by inserting the preparation into the fine tube after pulling off of the inner needle 1 , pushing the preparation with a pushing pole 5 till the inside of the body 2 cf. the accompanying Fig. 3 . The pushing pole 5 may be any pole which can be inserted into and can freely slide inside the fine tube 3 , and the above inner needle 1 may also be used as the pushing pole. In order to insert the preparation of the present invention into a deep region of the body, i.e. internal organs such as stomach wall, the device for fiberscope may be used, and by easily handling the fiberscope, one can effect procedures such as stabbing of the inner needle, insertion of the fine tube, pulling off of the inner needle, administration of the preparation and taking off of the fine tube. The preparation which can be administered by the above device may be any one of needle like or bar like shaped preparations which can be inserted and held within the fine tube 3 . Alternative devices for insertion of the needle like shaped solid preparations are injection needles provided with a inner pushing pole which can smoothly slide within the slit of the needle. The injection needles include conventional injection needles. The pushing pole has an outer diameter which is the same or smaller as the inner diameter of the injection needle and it can push a needle like shaped solid preparation having a diameter of 0.5 to 5 mm. The device for insertion of a needle like shaped solid preparation may be held with a conventional holding device 7 , but it may be also used by holding it at the tip of forceps needle for fiberscope. The administration manner of the needle like shaped solid preparation of the present invention is explained in more detail below. Previously, the needle like shaped solid preparation 9 is held within the injection needle 8 cf. the accompanying Fig. 4 , and the injection needle 8 is stabbed at the portion of the body 11 and simultaneously the preparation is administered into the body 11 by pushing it with a pushing pole 10 cf. the accompanying Fig. 5 . In order to administer the preparation to deeper regions of the body such as the stomach wall, it may be administered with a fiberscope as mentioned above. In such a case, for preventing of falling down of the preparation from the needle, it is preferable to provide a removable cover 12 at the tip of the needle cf. the accompanying Fig. 6 . The solid preparation useful for the above administration may be in any form such as needle like or bar like shape which can be held in a conventional injection needle. As is explained above, according to the device for injection of the present invention, the preparation of the present invention can easily be administered, for example, by insertion into the internal organs with a fiberscope and for administerating systematically or topically at the body surface with a device or needle as mentioned above . These methods are practically and clinically very useful, and it is a novel idea that a biodegradable solid preparation is administered in the above mentioned manner. The present invention is illustrated by the following Experiments and Examples, but should not be construed to be limited thereto.
