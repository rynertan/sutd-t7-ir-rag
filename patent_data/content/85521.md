# Slurry pump.

## Abstract
A slurry pump has a hopper 1 containing slurry. A pumping cylinder 5 containing a piston 9 communicates with the hopper 1 through the hopper wall. A delivery tube 17 is swung into and out of register with the cylinder 5 . Slurry is drawn into the cylinder 5 by the piston 9 and out through the delivery tube 17 . The pump is controlled by a lever 68 which has a central neutral position and two operating positions. Dangerous moving parts are covered by a guard 62 mounted on hinges 64 . An arm 74 on the guard 62 engages a slide 70 which has a channel 72 . If the guard 62 is moved from its closed position, the arm 74 slides the slide 70 so that the control lever 68 enters the channel 72 and moves to its neutral position. The external moving parts include releasable clamping means 33 for sealing the junction of the delivery tube 17 and the cylinder 5 while slurry is being transferred from the cylinder 5 to the tube 17 .
