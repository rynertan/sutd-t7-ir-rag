# Machine dishwashing compositions.

## Abstract
A mildly alkaline enzymatic detergent cleaning composi tion adapted for use in automatic dishwashing machines comprising a an amylolytic enzyme, b sodium triphos phate, c sodium carbonate and or borax, d sodium silicate, e a peroxy compound bleach, f a stabilizing agent, and optionally but preferably g a proteolytic enzyme and or h a low to non foaming nonionic surfactant and or i a fatty acid having chain length of about 12 18 carbon atoms, the amounts of components b , c and d being so adjusted that the composition will have sufficient builder and buffer ing capacity to maintain a solution pH of from 9.3 to 10.8. The composition presented in the form of a particulate product is an effective machine dishwashing composition comparable to conventional highly alkaline chlorine bleach containing products.
