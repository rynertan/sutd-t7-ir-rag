# Improved racquetball racquet construction.

## Abstract
The improved racquet 1 has a strung surface 11 which is larger in area than the strung surface of a conventional racquet, and in which the strung area 11 is both larger in length and width than the strung area of a conventional racquet. However, the overall weight and balance of a conventional racquetball racquet which have proven neces sary for good playing characteristics for all such racquets have been maintained. The racquet 1 has synergistically combined the weight of the racquet, the stiffness of the frame 3 , and the response characteristics to create a racquet of sufficient durability with a larger sweet spot to facilitate the palying of the sport and to increase the level of skill, particularly of the novice and intermediate players. The racquet 1 has an overall length of 18 ½ inches to 14 ¾ inches, a weight of 220 grams to 270 grams, and a center of gravity at a location within a range of 3 4 inch toward the handle 3 and ½ inch toward the head 2 as measured from the longitudinal center point of the racquet.
