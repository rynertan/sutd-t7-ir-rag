# Film type magnetic recording medium and method of manufacturing the medium.

## Abstract
A film type multilayer magnetic recording medium comprised of a film applied to a substratum in which coating film needle shaped magnetic grains are orientated with their longitudinal axes perpendicular to the film surface in a multilayer state and having a film thickness of 1.1 to 2.0 times the average length of the grains, has an excellent property, because the angular ratio Br Bs of both horizontal and vertical components respectively are 0.6 or more. As a result, it is possible to attain a high density recording. The film type multilayer magnetic recording medium of the present inventions is manufacturcd by applying a fluid film forming material, in which neddle shaped magnetic grains are dispersed to form a coating film having the thickness of 1.1 to 2.0 times the average length of the magnetic grains on a substratum, and then drying or hardening the film forming material in a magnetic field orientated perpendicularly toward the film surface.
