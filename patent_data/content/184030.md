# A VARIABLE RATE EGR VALVE WITH STEP MOTOR CONTROL AND METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A variable flow rate valve 10 comprising a housing 12 defining a vacuum chamber 35 and a flexible diaphragm 50 secured to said housing 12 . The diaphragm defines one extreme of the pressure chamber 35 and is movable in one direction in response to decreases in the pressure within the pressure chamber and movable in an opposite direction in response to increases in the pressure within the pressure chamber. The valve 10 further includes means 40, 100, 110, 112 for providing a mechanical position limit or stop for the diaphragm in the one direction and means 126, 84, 86, 92, 94 for selectively varying the pressure within the pressure chamber for causing the diaphragm to move in response to the pressure differential thereacross.
