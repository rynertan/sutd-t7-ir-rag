# Polyphosphazene polymers containing substituents derived from ketoximes and process for producing them.

## Abstract
Novel polyphosphazene copolymers are prepared which are comprised of repeating units represented by the formulas The polyphosphazene polymers of the present invention may be prepared by the reaction of a ketoxime and an additional reactant such as alkanol, aryl alcohol, mercaptan, or amine with poly dichlorophosphazene in the presence of a tertiary amine. The polymers of this invention may be modified by crosslinking or curing. The polymers of this invention can be utilized to form protective films and may also be utilized in applications such as molding, coatings, foams and the like.
