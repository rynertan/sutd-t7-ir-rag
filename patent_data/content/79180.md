# Improvements in scraper chain conveyors.

## Abstract
A flight bar for a scraper chain conveyor is formed from two, mating, identical, symmetrical half bars 4 . Each half bar is formed with a central portion 8 of channel section having an upright web 10 inclined from a lower, vertical, base portion and upper and lower flanges 12, 14 The lower flange 14 is inclined at approximately 5 to the horizontal upwardly from the near edge 20 thereof toward the upright web 10 . A strengthening rib 22 having a protruding portion 24 is provided slightly offset from the mid plane. The end portions 16 of each half bar are formed with a slightly oval aperture 30 having stepped edge portions 32 arranged to accommodate collars on cylindrical spacers secured to connecting pieces by through bolts. Alternatively, respective end portions are formed with an aperture and a boss fitting loosely in the aperture securable to a connecting piece by a through bolt.

## Description
DESCRIPrICN Improvements in Scraper chain in Conveyors . This invention relates to scraper chain conveyors and to flight bars therefor, and, more particularly, to scraper chain conveyors used to move ve particulate material, such as coal, along troughs or pans. In the past, such flight bars have generally been formed with a solid cross section aproximating to a square. According to the present invention there are provided flight bars for scraper chain conveyors each formed by mating half bars, each half bar having a central portion of channel crcss section formed by an upright web flanked by upper and lower horizontally extending flanges with the upright web being inclined inwardly fran the lower flange to the upper flange. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying, partly diagramnatic, drawings, in which Figure 1 is an elevation, with a portion anitted, of a flight bar formed by mating half bars of identical form for a scraper chain conveyor Figure 2 is a plan view of one mating half bar of the flight bar Figure 3 is a cross section taken on the line III III of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a cross section taken on the line IV IV of Figure lof one balf bar and Figure 5 is a cross section through an end portion of a flight bar indicating an alternative construction. The flight bar 2 shown in Figures 1 4 is for a scraper chain conveyor not shown including a pair of endless chains passing over end sprocket wheels and running in upper and lower races formed by inwardly lipped flanges on pans extending the length of the conveyor. Cbnnector pieces are positioned at spaced intervals along the churns in register to give spaced pairs of connector pieces. Bolted between each pair of connector pieces is the flight bar 2 formed by malting, identical, half bars 4, 6 each having a central portion 8 of channel section formed with an upright web 10 flanked by upper and lower horizontally extending flanges 12, 14.The upright web 10 is inclined both from the lower flange toward the upper flange and from a mid plane portion toward end portions 16 which provide attachment to the connector pieces. The free edges 18, 20 of the upper and lower flanges are disposed in the same vertical crosssection, the lower flange 14 has a greater dimension in the direction of travel of the flight bar than that of the upper flange 12. In addition, both the upper and lower flanges taper outwardly from a mld plane portion to correspond to the lateral inclination of the upright web 10.A strengthening rib 22 is provided slightly offset from the mid plane and has a portion 24 protruding beyond the vertical plane of the free edges 18, 20. The upper and lower flanges 12 14 are inclined inwardly by approximately 50, whilst the upright web 10 is inclined fran a vertical base portion 21 by approximately 20 . The end portions 16 of each half bar 4, 6 are formed with a vertical web 26 and an outwardly directed flange 28, the channel section of the central portion 8 of the half bar merging sooothly with the end portions.Each end portion 16 is formed with an aperture 30 of oval form having stepped edge portions 32 such that the aperture to the face 34 adjacent the outwardly directed flange is of the lesser area. Uton assembly, two half bars 4, 6 are placed together with the free edges 18, 20 of the upper and lower flanges 12, 14 abutting and the protruding portions 24 of the strengthening ribs 22 of the respective half bars extending into the channel portion of the other half bar.Plastic or steel cylindrical collars 38 are positioned in the apertures such that the collars 38 co act with the stepped edge portions 32 slidably to retain the spacers within the apertures. The end portions 16 are then positioned between opposing jas of connector pieces, a bolt passed through bores in the jaws and in the spacer and a nut tightened dbwn on the bolt to form a connection providing limited movement between the connector piece and the flight bar and retaining the to half bars in matting engagement. forming the flight bar from two, mating, channel section, half bars a bar of hollow section is produced having adequate strength and wear properties but requiring substantially less metal than a bar of solid section.The reduction in the amount of metal results in a reduction in weight and hence a possible reduction in the power requirements of the conveyor. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 5, the end portions 16 of the half bars 4, 6 are arranged to mate together. Thus one end portion is formed with a boss 42 on the inner face of the vertical web 26 ranote from the outwardly directed flange 28.A bore 44 penetrates the boss and the associated vertical web. Upon assembly, the bosses 42 in the respective end portions 16 of the half bars 4, 6 seat in the slightly oval apertures 40 in the adjacent end portions of the mating half bars and the bosses are positioned between the jaws of the connector pieces by means of bolts passing through bores in the jaws and the bores 44 in the bosses 42, a nut being tightened down on the bolt to secure the bolt.
