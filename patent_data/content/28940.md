The compounds of formula I form acid addition salts by reaction with various inorganic and organic acids. These salts frequently provide convenient means for separating the product from the reaction mixture in which it is produced or from the solvent in which it is extracted in view of their insolubility in various media. Thus the product may be precipitated in the form of an insoluble salt and converted, by conventional techniques, to the free base or to another soluble or insoluble salt as desired. Illustrative salts include the hydrohalides, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide and hydroiodide, especially the first two, other mineral acid salts, such as phosphate, sulfate, nitrate, etc., organic acid salts, such as oxalate, tartrate, malate, maleate, citrate, pamoate, fumarate, camphosulfonate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, salicylate, benzoate, ascorbate, mandelate, or the like. The compounds of formula I also form quaternary ammonium salts with lower alkyl halides, for example, methyl bromide, ethyl bromide and propyl iodide benzyl halides, such as benzyl chloride and dilower alkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl sulfate. To form the quaternary ammonium salts, the free base initially formed is intereacted with at least one equivalent of the desired alkylating agent. Preferred are those compounds of formula I wherein R1 and R2 are each n propyl orEMI5.1 taken together is morpholinyl, and R3 and R4 are hydrogen or one of R and R is t butyl. The compounds of formula I of the invention include all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Thus, either of the acetamidyloxy groups may be cis or trans to the aminohydroxypropyloxy chain. The most preferred compound of the invention is in the cis form of 2,2 f 5 3 l,l dirrthylethybamino 2 hydroxyoropoxy 1, 2,3,4 tetrahydro 2,3 naphthalene diyl bis oxy bis N,N dipropylacetamide . This compound has three assymetric centers and thus include the following isomers A. 2S 2a,3a,5 S 2,2 5 3 1,1 Dimethyl ethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3,4 tetra hydro 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bis N,N dipropylacetamide EMI6.1 B. 2R 2a,3a,5 R 2,2 5 3 1,1 Dimethyl ethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3,4 tetra hydro 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bis N,N dipropylacetamide EMI6.2 C. 2R 2 alpha , 3 alpha , 5 S 2,2 5 3 1,1 Dimethyl ethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3,4 tetra hydro 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bis N,N dipropylacetamide EMI6.3 D. 2S 2 alpha ,3 alpha ,5 R 2,2 5 3 1,1 Dimethyl ethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3,4 tetra hydro 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bislN,N dipropylacetamide EMI7.1 It has been found that one of the above optically active isomers A, B, C and D is substantially superior to the others in treating arrhythmia while, surprisingly, at the same time, is substantially less toxic than the others.The superior, but less toxic, antiarrhythmia agent o the invention is the optically active isomerB, namely, B. 2R 2a,3a,5 R 2,2 5 3 1,1 Dimethyl ethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3,4 tetra hydro 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bis N,N dipropylacetamide which has the structureEMI8.1 The isomer B may be prepared as described in applicationSerial No. Moniot filed concurrently herewith. The compounds of formula I may be formed by reacting 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5 phenylmethoxy 2,3 naphthalenediolEMI8.2 with a haloacetamide III EMI9.1 wherein X is C1 or Br to form a 2,2 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5 phenyl methoxy 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bisEsubsti tuted acetamide of the structureEMI9.2 The formula IV compounds represent a new class of intermediates and also show activity against acute myocardial infarction as indicated by the test described by Harris, A. S. Delayed Development of Ventricular Ectopic Rhythms Following ExperimentalCoronary Occlusion , Circulation 1 1318 1328, 1950. The above reaction is carried out employing a molar ratio of II III of within the range of from about 1 2 to about 1 4 in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride or sodamide in a solvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or dioxane, while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture of within the range of from about 0 to about 50 0C for periods of from 5 to 72 hours. The formula IV benzyloxy compound is then reduced to the corresponding hydroxy derivatives by hydrogenating same in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, or platinum oxide in the presence of a lower alkanol solvent, such as ethanol to form the formula V hydroxy compoundEMI10.1 The formula V compound is also a novel intermediate and has been found to be active against acute myocardial infarction. The formula V compound is converted to the corresponding epoxy derivative VI by reactingV with epichlorohydrin in an inert solvent, such as acetone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and water containing sodium hydroxide to form the epoxide VIIEMI10.2 The above reaction is carried out preferably at reflux temperature of the solvent while stirring vigorously for periods of from 0.5 to 7 hours. Alternatively, the reaction may be carried out in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide using sodium methoxide as the condensing agent, at a temperature of 50 to 300C for 3 to 20 hours. Alternatively, VII is prepared by alkylation of epoxydiol XV cis or trans J. Med. Chem. 21, 913 1978 with haloacetamide as described in the conversion of II to IV. The epoxide VII is converted to the formula I compounds of the invention by reacting VII with an amineEMI11.1 in a molar ratio of VII VIII of within the range of from about 1 1 to about 1 10 in the presence of a lower alkanol, such as methanol or ethanol, for periods of from 5 to 24 hours. The 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5 phenylmethoxy 2,3 naphthalenediol of formula II may be prepared from the corresponding triol IXEMI11.2 by first converting to the corresponding acetonide XEMI11.3 as described in J. Med. Chem. 21, 913 1978 , where the ok groups are in the cis configuration which is employed to make the compounds of formula I in the cis configuration . Thereafter, the acetonide X is converted to the correspondingEMI12.1 by reacting X with a benzylhalide in the presence of a weak base. The benzyloxy derivative XI is then reacted with a weak adid, such as acetic acid to form the 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5 henylmethoxy 2,3naphthalenediol II. Alternatively, 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5 phenyl methoxy 2,3 naphthalenediol II may be prepared by direct alkylation of triol IX with one equivalent of a base, such as sodium methoxide in a solvent, such as dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide. Compounds of formula I where R3 or R4 H may also be prepared by reacting 5 3 alkylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydro 2 , 3 naphthalenediol XII, J. Med. alem. 21, 913 1978 and U. S. Patent No. 3,935,267 the disclosure of which is inoorporated herein by reference or any of its individual isomers which can be separated by standardEMI12.2 with an aromatic aldehyde, such as benzaldehyde in a hydrocarbon solvent, such as xylene or toluene at reflux for 1 to 3 days with continuous water separation to give the phenyl oxazolidine protected intermediate XIIIEMI13.1 Alkylation of XIII with haloacetamides as previously described for the conversion of II to IV gives the alkylated intermediate XIVEMI13.2 The Example XIV compounds represent novel intermediates. Subsequent aqueous mineral acid hydrolysis removes the oxazolidinyl protecting group and gives compounds of formula I. Thus, for example, a sample of 5 3 l,l dimethylethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydro 2, 3 cis naphthalenediol, J. Med. Chem. 21, 913 1978 and U. S. Patent No. 3,935,267, may be fractionally crystallized from acetonitrile to give two racemates, R I and R II. Racemate R I, a 1 1 mixture of the 2S,3R,5S and 2R,3S,5R enantiomers,EMI14.1 may be reacted with an aromatic aldehyde, such as benzaldehyde in a hydrocarbon solvent to give the phenyl oxazolidine protected intermediate. Alkylation with haloacetamides, such as dipropylchloroacetamide, followed by removal of the phenyl oxazolidinyl protesting group gives compounds of formula I as a 1 1 mixture of two enantiomers. Alternatively, racemate R I may be converted to the salt of an optically active acid, such as dibenzoyl l tartaric acid, and fractionally crystallized to separate the enantiomeric salts. The separated enantiomeric salts can each be neutralized to give the individual enantiomers.Each enantiomer may then be reacted with an aromatic aldehyde as previously described to give the phenyl oxazolidinyl protected intermediate.Alkylation with haloacetamides as previously described followed by removal of the phenyloxazolidinyl protecting group gives compounds of formula I as the individual enantiomer. A particularly good method of preparation, when separation of the various isomers is desired, involves as the first step, reaction of the triol of Formula IX with an R alkyl or aryl sulfonyl solketal a 1,3dioxalane 4 methanol, 4 alkyl or aryl sulfonate ester of Formula XV to form separable isomers of 1, 2, 3, 4 tetrahydro 5 1,3 dioxolan 4 yl methoxy 2,3 naphthalene diol XVI and XVII , i.e., EMI16.1 The sulfonate ester of Formula XV is prepared from the corresponding alcohol XVIII.EMI16.2 by standard sulfonation procedures. The 1,3 dioxolane 4 methanol compound of Formula XVIII and the preparation of the toluene sulfonate ester are described in an article by J.J. Baldwin et al., J. Org. Chem, 43, No.25 pg. 4876 1978 where the dioxolane is derived from acetone, e.g., XV is R 3 toxyloxypropanediol acetonide and the R groups are each methyl. Other dioxolanes derived from other carbonyl compounds than acetone such as acetophenone or benzaldehyde as is known in the art can be used. The XVI and XVII intermediates can then be used in place of the 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5 phenylmethoxy 2,3 napthalenediol intermediate of Formula II. This preferred procedure directed to the preparation of isomer B of the most preferred compound, i.e., 2R l2a,3a,5 R 2,2 5 3 l,l dimethyl ethyl amino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 2,3 naphthalenediyl bis oxy bis N,N dipropylacetamide is outlined below. EMI18.1 EMI19.1 In carrying out the above outlined procedure, the cis 5,6,7,9 tetrahydro 1,6,7 naphthalenetriol is dissolved in an inert solvent, such as dimethylformamide, or dimethylsulfoxide and the solution treated with a base, such as a metal hydride, for example, sodium hydride or sodamide molar ratio of the triol to the base being preferably 1 1 , preferably in oil dispersion.After cessation of gas evolution, an R alkyl or aryl sulfonyl solketal, such as R tosylsolketal that is, R 2, 2 dimethyl 1, 3 dioxolone 4 methanol, 4 methylbenzenesulfonate ester or R mesitylenesulfonylsolketal is added to the reaction mixture in a molar ratio to the naphthalenetriol of from about 1 1 to about 1.5 1, the reaction mixture is stirred under inert atmosphere and heated to and maintained at a temperature of from about 30 to about 80 0C for a period of from about 1 to about 24 hours. Next, the reaction mixture is cooled, concentrated and recrystallized to form a mixture of the acetonide intermediates of formulae XX isomer and XXI d isomer wherein the two alcoholic hydroxyl groups of each remain free while the phenolic hydroxyl group is converted to the ether. The l isomer compound XX is separated from the mixture by ether trituration and recrystallization, and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide, together with an N,N dipropylhalo acetamide, such as N,N dipropylchloro, iodo or bromoacetamide employing a molar ratio of acetamide to III of from about 211 to about 3 1 A base, such as metal hyaride, for example, sodium hydride in oil dispersion or sodamide is added to the solution and the esultnnB suspension is stinted for a period of from about 1 to about 48 hours under inert atmosphere preLerably argon at room temperature to form the formula XXII canpound.The formula V compound is extracted from the reaction mixture, dried and then slurried in water for use in hydrolyzing the acetonide ring and making the compound of formula XXIII. To the aqueous slurry of the compound of formula V is added a lower alkanol solvent, such as methanol, ethanol or a mixture thereof, and an inert solvent, such as acetone or tetrahydrofuran and a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid. The mixture is heated to a temperature within the range of from about 25 to about 95 0C for up to 120 minutes or more, cooled and concentrated to a dense oil which may be further purified. The so formed compound of formula VI is dissolved in a basic solvent, such as pyridine and or a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, such as chloroform and is maintained at a temperature of from about 100 C to about 100C under an inert atmosphere, preferably argon. Mesitylenesulfonyl chloride is added employing a molar ratio of same to the compound VI of from about 1 1 to about 1.5 1 and the reaction mixture maintained below 0 for a period of up to 24 hours or more. Thereafter, the compound Xh present in the reaction mixture is removed therefrom by solvent extraction and is employed in making the isomer B as described below. A solution of compound XXIV in t butylamine as the solvent, in a sealed reaction vessel, employing a molar ratio of XXIV to amine of from about 1 1 to about 20 1 or more, is heated at a temperature of up to 900C, for up to 48 hours or more.The resulting solution is treated with an inert hydrocarbon solvent, such as hexane, heptane or benzene, and the solution is filtered and concentrated. A dense oil is formed from which isomer B is partitioned and extracted. The isomer of formula B has anti arrhythmic activity substantially superior to that found in Isomers A, C and D described hereinbefore. The compounds of formula I have antiarrhythmic activity as indicated by the Harris coronary ligated dog test described by Harris, A. S.,Circulation 1 1318 1328, 1950 mentioned hereinbefore and are useful in the treatment of arrhythmia in mammalian species, for example, rats and dogs. A compound of formula I above as well as its physiologically acceptable acid salts or a compound of formula IV may be compounded according to pharmaceutical practice in oral or parenteral dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, elixirs, injectables or powders for administration of about 10 mg to 2 gr per day, preferably 125 mg to 175 mg per day, in 2 to 4 divided doses.
