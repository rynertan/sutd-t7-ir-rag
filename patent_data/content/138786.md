# An imitation candle.

## Abstract
An imitation candle includes an elongated outer candle casing 43 , having located at one end thereof an electric light bulb 1 carried on one end of a pendulum. The other end of the pendulum carries a counterweight 18 comprising, at least in part, a permanent magnet 21 . The pendulum is mounted on two wire like elements 15 extending in a com mon plane from a common connector 11 on the pendulum. The ends of the wire like elements remote from one another are anchored in a holder 23 located around the pendulum. The poles of the permanent magnet 21 lie on a line extend ing at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the pendulum. The two wire like elements 15 extending from the common connector 11 in diametrically opposite directions prefer ably from conductors 3, 4 leading to the electric light bulb.
