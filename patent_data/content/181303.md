# Tool in the form of a compound body and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
Tools for machining etc can according to the invention be made better and cheaper by being composed of a compound material forming core and cover resp of the tool. The core consists thereby of a material which is situated in the gap between cemented carbide and high speed steel regarding its properties and which contains 30 70 vol hard constituents in the form of carbides, nitrides and or carbonit rides of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Or, Mo, and or W in a matrix based on Fe, Ni and or Co and that the cover comprises an alloy based on Fe, Co and or Ni generally steel and preferably tool steel or stainless steel.
