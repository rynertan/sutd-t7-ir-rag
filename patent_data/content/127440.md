# Integrated circuit device incorporating a data processing unit and a ROM storing applications program therein.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit device comprises a data processing unit CPU 1 , a first read only memory ROM 5 storing an applications program to be executed in the CPU, a second ROM 6 having an address space which is addressed in com mon with the first ROM and storing a test program for a function diagnosis, and a test control unit 14 . The test control unit is responsive to a test control signal TEST externally applied in a test mode to couple the second ROM to the CPU so that the test program for setting an initial condition is executed. During the execution of the test program, the first ROM is coupled to the CPU, thereby executing applications program instructions the contents and the number of which are externally designated. Thereafter, the second ROM is coupled to the CPU so as to execute the test program for deciding a test complete condition. The execution result of the applications program instructions are compared with expected values to decide if the integrated circuit device func tions normally. The address space of first and second ROMs is expanded in a software manner, and the address space of the first ROM can be assigned only to the applications program.
