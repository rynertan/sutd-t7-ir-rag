## Description
AFFIXING OF EAR PIERCING MEMBERS This invention relates to a method of affixing to an ear an ear piercing member and to devices for use in that method. The invention relates particularly, though not exclusively, to the affixing in a human ear of an ear stud. A conventional method of inserting into a human ear lobe a stud or other ear piercing member is by means of a projector of a pistol type, for example a projector having a plunger to engage the stud, propulsion means to propel the plunger, means to restrain the plunger against the propulsion means and a trigger by which the user can release the restraining means and allow the plunger and the stud carried thereby to be propelled against the ear lobe. As ear piercing commonly results in one or two drops of blood being released from the ear lobe, use of this conventional method very often results in traces of blood being deposited on those surfaces of the projector which come into contact with the ear lobe during the piercing operation. Although rigorous washing of the projector after an ear piercing operation can sometimes remove all traces of blood this is not always the case.Even more serious is the fact that in practice the instrument is not always washed thoroughly, and traces of blood remain on it between one ear piercing and the next. In consequence, there is a substantial risk of infection being transmitted from one person to another when using the conventional method of ear piercing. There has now been devised, according to the present invention, an improved method of ear piercing by means of which the disadvantage . referred to above can be avoided. Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention provides a method of affixing in an ear an ear piercing member, which comprises presenting said member adjacent one side of the ear holding adjacent the other side of the ear a retaining device for said member, the device being supported by a disposable support projecting the ear piercing member against said one side of the ear with sufficient force to cause said member to pierce the ear and engage the retaining device and removing the support from said device. In a second aspect the invention provides a pack for use in the method of the first aspect of the invention the pack comprising an ear piercing member, a retaining device for retaining the ear piercing member in place in an ear and a holder for the retaining device, said holder being adapted to constitute the disposable support of the method of the first aspect pf the invention, and the retaining device being held by the holder so that the holder can be used as the disposable support in the method of the first aspect of the invention without re arrangement of said device with respect to the holder. The holder conveniently also holds the ear piercing member in such a way that said member can be loaded in a projector without manual contact with said member. There is now described, by way of example and with reference to the accompanying informal drawings, a method of affixing in a human ear an ear stud, according to an embodiment of the first aspect of the invention and a pack comprising an ear stud, back clasp and holder therefor, according to an embodiment of the second aspect of the invention. In the drawings FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of the pack FIGURE 2 is a front elevation of the holder FIGURE 3 is a cross section on the line III III of Figure 2 FIGURE 4 is a rear elevation of the holder FIGURE 5 is a top plan view of the holder FIGURE 6 is a bottom plan view of the holder FIGURE 7 is a front. elevation of a cover for the re action member of a projector for the ear piercing member FIGURE 8 is a cross section on the line VIII VIII of Figure 7 FIGURE 9 is a top plan view of the cover and FIGURES 10 and 11 are respectively a front elevation and side elevation partly in section of an alternative cover for the reaction member. Sheet 4 of the drawings comprises sketches illustrating the several stages or steps of the embodiment of the method of the invention with reference to the use of a projector of the pistol type for the stud. With reference to Figure 1 the pack comprises a sealed container 20 of transparent. plastics material containing a disposable support 21 on which there is mounted a stud ear piercing member 22 and a back clasp 23 adapted to engage the leading end of the stud 22, and a disposable cover 24 the purpose of which is described below. The disposable support 21 is shown in greater detail in Figures 2 to 6 . and the disposable cover 24 is shown in greater detail in Figures 7 to 9.It will be seen from the drawings that holder disposable support 21 has a notch 30 Figures 5 and 6 providing the means of holding the stud 22 in position on the support 21, that the slot 31 provides the means of holding the back clasp 23 in position on the support and that the tongue 32 acts as a spring to prevent accidental displacement of the back clasp from slot 31. The arched re entrant 33 in support 21 provides a means of engagement with an extension member of a pistol type projector for the stud, as is described below. There is now described, with reference to sheet 4 of the accompanying drawings an embodiment of the method of the invention. In this method embodiment there is used as projector for the ear piercing stud a projector of the pistol type the muzzle end of which is shown in the drawings of sheet 4. The remainder of the projector not shown on sheet 4 comprises a pistol grip handle and, at the rearward end of the projector plunger, an enlargement thereof by means of which the plunger can be cocked.these features of the remainder of the projector can be of the type found in conventional pistol type projectors for ear piercing. The following steps of the method embodiment are numbered using the numbers shown on sheet 4 of the drawings.STEP I The ear lobe to be pierced is cleansed with an antiseptic.STEP 2 The sterile pack is opened and there is removed therefrom the disposable cover 24.STEP 3 The disposable cover 24 is engaged with the re action member of the projector so that the hood portion of the cover engages the upper curved surface of the re action member and the plate like portion of the cover thereby covers the front face of the re action member. STEP 4 With the disposable cover in place on the re action member and the projector in its uncocked stated, the disposable support is presented to the lug at the forward end of the projector plunger and the head of the stud, which is a close push fit with an internal bore in the plunger, is engaged therewith by manual presure on the disposable support.STEP 5 By a manual twisting motion of the support 21 the stud is detached therefrom without its head being displaced from the bore of the plunger. The support is then presented to the lug or locater and the arched re entrant 33 is engaged with the lug thereby mounting support 21 so that the back clasp held therein comes into alignment with the leading end of the stud 22. STEP 6 The projector is then cocked by manual withdrawal of the plunger against the spring or other propelling means of the projector.STEP 7 The cocked projector is then presented to the ear lobe to be pierced so that the lobe enters the gap defined by the forward facing surface of the disposable cover 24 and the rearward facing surface of support 21. Rearward pressure on the projector trigger causes the lug to be drawn backwards until the ear lobe is sandwiched between the support 21 and disposable cover 24. Further backward pressure on the trigger causes the plunger to be released and instantly to plunge forward under the influence of the propelling means carrying with it the stud whose leading pointed end pierces the ear lobe and engages with the centrally located aperture in the back clasp. Pressure on the trigger is then released allowing the lug and the support mounted thereon to move forward and release the ear lobe. STEP 8 The support 21 and cover 24 are then removed from the projector and disposed of leaving the projector ready for the next piercing. Any drop of blood emerging from the ear lobe during the piercing is prevented from contact with the lug and re action member of the projector by means of the disposable support 2 1 and disposable cover 24, respectively. Although the invention hasbeen described with reference to the piercing of human ears, it is applicable also to affixing ear piercing members to. ears of mammals and other animals.
