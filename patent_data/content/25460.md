## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to a method of coupling aryl and heteroaryl polyhalides and more particularly to the use of a catalyst mixture of an anhydrous nickel compound and a ligand in the presence of a reducing metal in a dipolar aprotic solvent. Reactions which form carbon carbon bonds are few although they are extremely useful in organic synthesis. In the formation of these bonds involving aryl groups, coupling is usually accomplished through the use of a metal. The use of copper in the Ullman reaction is described in Chem. Rev. 38,139 1946 64, 613 1964 . The use of nickel complexes was described by M. F. Semmeihack, et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 93, 5908 1971 . The use of palladium complexes was described by F.R.S. Clark, et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 121 1975 . The latter reactions with nickel or palladium complexes have the advantage of proceeding at moderate temperatures but are disadvantageous in that aryl chlorides were either completely unreactive or gave very poor yields. Yanamoto et al. in the Bulletin of theChemical Society of Japan, 51,7 1978 pages 2091 2097 and in Japanese Koki 52 154900 77 describe the poly concensation of Gi and polyhalogenated organic compounds via magnesium Grignard reagents in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to produce polyphenylene type polymers. The catalysts include di and trivalent compounds such as NiC12 2,2 bipyridine , NiBr2 triphenylphosphine 2, PdCl2 2,2 bipyridine , NiC12, Cowl2, FeC12, and FeC13. The reaction is conducted in ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dibutyl ether and diglyme. The work of Yamamoto, et al. was a stated extension of well known prior art on the coupling of aromatic Grignard reagents with aryl halides. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a method of coupling aryl and heteroaryl polyhalides which comprises contacting said aryl and heteroaryl polyhalides, wherein the halide is selected from C1, Br or l, or mixtures thereof, in an aprotic solvent with a catalytic amount of a catalyst mixture comprising an anhydrous nickel compound and at least one ligand selected from the group consisting of a triaryl phosphine having 6 to about 14 carbons in each aryl moiety and an aromatic bidentate compound containing at least one ring nitrogen atom and about 5 to about 30 carbon atoms, in the presence of a reducing metal selected from the group consisting of zinc, magnesium, or manganese, or mixtures thereof, at a temperature of from about 0 to about 250 C, wherein the ratio of equivalents of nickel to equivalents of aryl or heteroaryl polyhalide is in the range of about 0.0001 to about 0.5, the amount of ligand is from about 0.1 to about 100 moles per gram atom of nickel and the amount of reducing metal is at least about 0.5 equivalent per equivalent of aryl or heteroaryl polyhalide. This invention provides a novel process for the production of aryl and heteroaryl oligomers and polymers. It was unexpected that high performance polymers could be produced from aryl and heteroaryl polyhalides at moderate temperatures. The coupling reaction takes place at temperatures of from about 0 to about 250 C, preferably from about 25 to about 120 C,and most preferably from about 40 to about 80 C. Pressure is not critical and so superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressures can be used as well as atmospheric pressure. Reaction is carried out in an inert atmosphere. Reaction time can vary from minutes to as long as several hours. Inorganic salt promoters may be used to reduce reaction times and or temperatures Preferred promoters include alkali, alkaline earth, zinc, magnesium, manganese and aluminum halides, or mixtures thereof. Iodines are particularly preferred.The amount of promoter,when used, can range from about 0.1 to about 1000 moles per gram atom of nickel with about 1 to about 100 moles of promoter being preferred.If desired one can also employ alkali, alkaline earth, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and aluminum suLfates or phosphates, or mixtures thereof as promoters. Suitable nickel compounds are nickel 6 complexes and those reducible by organometallic. and metal reducing agents. These compounds include nickel halides, that is, the chlorides, bromides and iodides, nickel sulfates, nickel phosphates, nickel carbonates, nickel salts of organic acids having 1 to 18 carbons, such as, nickel formate, nickel acetate, and nickel organic complexes such as nickel acetylacetonate,dichloro bis triphenylphosphine nickel II and the like and nickel 0 compounds such as bis 1,5 cyclooctadiene nickel, tetrakis triphenylphosphine nickel, and the like. The anion of the nickel compounds is unimportant and serves merely to provide nickel ion to the catalyst mixture, but it must not interfere with the reaction of the nickel compound with the ligand.The preferred anions are the halides. The preferred ratio of gram atoms of nickel to equivalents of aryl or heteroaryl polyhalide is about 0.001 to about 0.1. Suitable triaryl phosphines include triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphines containing alkyl or alkoxy substituents having up to about 8 carbon atoms, and unsubstituted or alkyl and alkoxy substituted trinaphthyl phosphines. Suitable bidentate compounds include 2,2 bipyridine, l,10 phenanthroline, 1,8 naphthylpyridine, 2 methylaminopyridine, and the like. The ratio of triarylphosphine to nickel can range from 0 to about 100, preferably from about 1 to about 10 moles per gram atom of nickel. The ratio of bidentate ligand to nickel can range from 0 to about 5, preferably from about 0.2 to about 2, moles of bidentate ligand to gram atom of nickel. It is preferred to use a combination of triarylphosphine and aromatic bidentate ligand, wherein the ratio of triarylphosphine to nickel varies from about 1 to about 3, and the ratio of bidentate ligand to nickel varies from about 0.5 to about 2 moles per gram atom of nickel. Preferred aprotic solvents include dipolar solvents, such as dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane,and the like. If desired these aprotic solvents can be mixed with lower polarity inert solvents, such as saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, including pentanes, hexanes, dodecanes, and the like aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes and the like saturated aliphatic and cycloaliphatic ethers, such as diethyl ether, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran and the like. It is preferred that all solvents used in the practice. of this invention be anhydrous. To produce high polymers all reagents and solvents should be anhydrous. Although magnesium and. manganese metals can be used, zinc metal is the preferred metal. It is also preferred that the metal be in finely divided form with an average sieve size of 20 or finer when measured on the U.S. sieve scale. Although the stoichiometric amount of reducing metal required in this coupling reaction is about 0.5 moles of reducing metal per equivalent of aryl or heteroaryl polyhalide, it is preferred to use a 50 percent excess or greater. While not wishing to be bound by any scientific theory or explanation of the mechanism of the coupling reaction of this invention, it is believed that the combination of nickel compound, ligand and reducing metal provides nickel in a zero valent state, a form which in an anhydrous aprotic medium enables the coupling of aryl and or heteroaryl polyhalides to take place in excellent yields. The nickel 0 ligand complex believed to be the active catalyst can be formed in situ in the presence of an aryl and or heteroaryl polyhalide, or the catalyst can be preformed in situ prior to the addition of the aryl and or heteroaryl polyhalide. A method for the determination of zero valent nickel is described by C. A. Tolman, J. Am. Chem. Soc.92, 2956 1970 .
