## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing optically active glycerol derivatives by a biochemical resolution which comprises i subjecting an ester having the general formula R,S I wherein X is a halogen atom, R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of C₁ to C₈ and R is an aromatic hydrocarbon group or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of C₁ to C₂, to the action of enzymes derived from either microorganisms or animal organs, wherein said enzymes have a stereo selective esterase activity to asymmetrically hydrolyze the ester having the general formula R,S I to give a mixture of an optically active alcohol having the general formula II wherein X and R are as above and an optically active ester having the general formula I wherein X, R and R are as above the alcohol II and the ester I having opposite optical activities and ii obtaining the optically active alcohol having the general formula II and the optically active ester having the general formula I by separating operations. The above optically active glycerol derivatives, both R form and S form, are very useful compounds that can be converted to various kinds of optically active drugs such as, for instance, ℓ carnitine, S β blocker and optically active platelet activating factor antagonists. It has been known that these optically active glycerol derivatives could be synthesized from D mannitol J.J. Baldwin et al., J. Org. Chem., The present inventors have been studied on an asymmetrical hydrolysis of the racemic ester having the general formula R,S I by subjecting the ester having the general formula R,S I to the action of the enzymes having a stereo selective esterase activity in order to obtain an optically active alcohol and ester, and it was found that enzymes prepared from Microorganisms of such genus as wherein X, R and R are as above, and the alcohol having the general formula S II wherein X and R are as above. The optically active ester having the general formula I The ester I and alcohol II can be easily obtained by separating operation such as silica gel column chromatography and each ester and alcohol is obtained. In accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a process for preparing optically active glycerol derivatives, wherein the optically active ester having the general formula I and the optically active alcohol having the general formula II The substitutents X, R and R in the general formula R,S I of the ester employed for a substrate in the present invention are explained in more detail. The substitutent X is a halogen atom such as, for instance, chlorine or bromine. The substituent R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of C₁ to C₈, preferably an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of C₁ to C₃ in view point of a hydrolysis rate. The aliphatic hydrocarbon group may be substituted with a halogen group or hydroxyl group. The substituent R is an aromatic hydrocarbon group such as, for instance, tolyl, Phenyl or naphthylene, or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group such as, for instance, methane or ethane. The aromatic hydrocarbon group or the aliphatic hydrocarbon group may be substituted with a halogen atom or hydroxyl group. In order to obtain the starting ester R,S I , an equimolar amount of sulfonic acid and epichlorohydrin are reacted in the presence of conventional organic solvent such as dichloromethane or ethyl acetate, or without solvent while cooling, to give the racemic alcohol having the general fomula R,S II Any enzyme may be employed, which has a stereo selective esterase activity to asymmetrically hydrolyze the racemic ester R,S I to produce the ester R I and the alcohol S II . Enzymes employed in the present invention are prepared from microorganism for example, such genus as The asymmetric hydrolysis is carried out in such a way that 2 to 80 w v of the substrate of the racemic ester R,S I is suspended in the reaction solution, to which the enzyme is added in a suitable amount, for instance, in a ratio of 1 1 to 1 1000 enzyme substrate , and the reaction is proceeded at 10 to 40 C, preferably 25 to 35 C. An amount of the remaining substrate and an amount of the reaction product are measured by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC and the reaction is stopped when 1 1 of a molar ratio of the ester I and the alcohol II in the reaction solution is obtained. The reaction may be conducted at the pH value ranging from 4 to 8.5. A neutralizing agent such as NaOH solution is preferably employed to mantain the pH value in the range of 6 to 7.5 since the pH value of the reaction solution is inclined to shift to the acidic side as the reaction proceeds. Further, immobilization of the enzyme makes it possible to conduct the above asymmetric hydrolysis repeatedly. After completion of the reaction the ester I and the alcohol II The optically active ester I obtained after separation may be concentrated, as it is, to give the ester with a high optical purity, or may be hydrolyzed under acidic condition to give the corresponding alcohol II . For a synthesis of ℓ carnitine, the obtained ester I is reacted with sodium cyanide in a methanol solution and the acyl group of the ester I at 2 position being removed simultaneously to produce γ halogeno β hydroxy butyronitril.
