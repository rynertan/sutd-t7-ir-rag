# Two stage decoder circuit.

## Abstract
A two state decoder circuit including a first stage decoder circuit 7 1 to 8 2, 9, 10, 11 , for decoding upper bits A₀ to A₃ of an input signal, and a second stage decoder circuit 4, 5, 6 , which is activated by receiving a selected output signal of the first stage decoder circuit and which decodes lower bits A₄ to A₇ of the input signal. The first stage decoder circuit is formed by a threshold operation type logic circuit 11 which carries out selection or non selection by comparing the input signal 9a, 10a with a predetermined threshold level VR , and the second stage decoder circuit is formed by a diode matrix circuit D₅ to D₈ .
