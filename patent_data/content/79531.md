# Digital fluorographic processor control.

## Abstract
A method of controlling a digital video processor in a digital fluorography system wherein the electronic compo nents of the processor are variously configured to perform math functions and manipulations on digital image data obtained in connection with carrying out x ray examination procedures and the images are displayed on a television monitor or recorded. A system controller sends a complete recipe for a procedure to the memory of a microprocessor based CPU that controls the video processor. The latter CPU interprets the instructions and effects configurations and reconfigurations in the data paths of the video processor during television vertical blanking intervals.
