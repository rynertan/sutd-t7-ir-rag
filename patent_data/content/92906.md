# Automatic paper feeding device for a facsimile equipment or the like apparatus.

## Abstract
An automatic paper feeding device for a facsimile equipment or the like apparatus is disclosed which includes a feeding roller 3 disposed below the feeding end part of an inclined paper feeding board 2 and a reversing roller 7 located above the feeding roller 2 in a line contact relation to be rotated in the opposite direction to that of drawing of papers from the paper feeding board 2 , the reversing roller being rotatably supported at the free end part of side plate members 20 adapted to turn about a support shaft 21 . A connecting line between the shafts 4, 8 of the feeding roller 7 and the reversing roller 7 extends substantially at a right angle relative to a connecting line between the shaft 8 of the reversing roller 7 and the support shaft 21 for the side plate members 20 . The direction of tension given by an endless belt 36 for rotating the reversing roller 7 is selectively determined to extend substantially at a right angle relative to the connecting line between the shafts 4, 8 of the feeding roller 3 and the reversing roller 7 whereby contact pressure to be exerted on the feeding roller 3 by the tension of the endless belt 36 via the reversing roller 7 becomes practically zero.
