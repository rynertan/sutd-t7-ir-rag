# HERMETICALLY SEALED ENCLOSURE FOR THIN FILM DEVICES

## Abstract
A hermetically sealed enclosure for a thin film device, such as an electroluminescent device, in which the device in cludes a thin film matrix supported on a glass substrate. The glass substrate is mounted in a frame and a frit seal is provided between the glass substrate and the frame. A cover is also se cured and sealed to the frame by a weld or solder joint. The in tegrity of both the substrate to frame seal and the frame to cover seal is preserved by forming the surfaces bounding each seal out of materials having substantially similar coefficients of thermal expansion. Since the rates of expansion will be similar, the seals should not develop weaknesses throughout the life of the device over a range of temperatures.
