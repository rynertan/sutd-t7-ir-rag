## Description
SENSITIZED ORGANIC ELECTRON DONOR COMPOUNDS TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel photoconductive layers which comprise organic electron donor compounds and sensitizer dyes selected from the group consisting of 1 phenylsulfonyl or benzoyl substituted imidazo 4,5 b quinoxaline dyes, 2 phenylsulfonyl or benzoyl substituted indolenine dyes, and 3 highly fluorinated aliphatic sulfonyl sensitizer dyes. These layers are particularly useful in imaging systems such aselectrophotography or electroradiography. BACKGROUND OF THE ART The technology of electrophotography is commercially well established. A wide variety of processes and apparatus are used, although they have many characteristics in common. One of the more common forms of this technology involves the use of a plate having a photoconductive insulating layer, generally coated on a conductive layer. Imaging is effected by first uniformly electrostatically charging the surface of the photoconductive layer and then exposing the charged layer to an image or pattern of activating electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light or ultraviolet radiation. This exposure selectively enables the charge in the irradiated areas of the photoconductive insulator to dissipate. The charge which remains in the non irradiated areas forms a latent image which may be further processed to form a more permanent record of the exposing image or pattern.The most common form of additional processing involves the attraction of particles of material selectively to the charged areas and fusing them to the photoconductive layer or transferring the particles in their imagewise distribution to another surface to which they are more permanently bound by an adhesive or by fusion of the particles themselves. A common electrophotographic construction comprises, in sequence, a substrate, a conductive layer, and a photoconductive insulating layer. Typical classes of photoconductive materials useful in electrophotography include 1 inorganic crystalline photoconductors such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium sulfoselenide, cadmium selenide, zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, and mixtures thereof, 2 inorganic photoconductive glasses such as amorphous selenium, selenium alloys, and selenium arsenic, and 3 organic photoconductors such as phthalocyanine pigments and polyvinyl carbazole, with or without binders and additives which extend their range of spectral sensitivity. These systems are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,877,935 discusses various problems associated with the crystalline and amorphous classes of photoconductors and shows the use of polynuclear quinone pigments in a binder as a photoconductive layer. U.S.Patent No. 3,824,099 shows the use of squaric acid methine sensitizing dyes and triaryl pyrazoline charge transport materials as an electrophotographic construction. Cadmium sulfoselenide plates are shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,764,315, and one of the original disclosures of the use of poly N vinylcarbazole as a photoconductive insulating layer is provided in U.S. PatentNo. 3,037,861. A number of diverse organic photoconductors have been disclosed since the development of the carbazole class of photoconductors such as quinones and anthrones e.g., Hayashi et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, vol. 39, 1966 pp. 1670 1673 , but the carbazoles have continued to attract the greatest attention. Problems particularly associated with the use of carbazoles as a positive charge transporting material which is capable of supporting the injection of photoexcited holes from a photoconductive layer and is capable of transporting the injected holes also exist in this area of technology. The carbazole condensates with aldehydes as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,025,341 have a tendency to oligomerize. This oligomerization can cause a number of problems. The oligomers formed are not of a uniform molecular weight and carbazole content. This creates problems in purification and can create undesirable variations in photoconductive or charge transport properties.Triaryl methanes including a carbazole moiety as shown in Xerox Disclosure Journal,Vol. 3, No. 1, Jan Feb 1978, page 7 also tend to be sensitive to oxidation which converts them to an ionic species which will not act as a photoconductive insulator but rather will act as a conductor. Japanese Patent Publication 52 34735 discloses carbazole organic photoconductor materials which may have substituents thereon which would inherently prevent oligomerization of the carbazoles. This is not recognized in the disclosure and the carbazoles would still be subject to oxidation problems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Electronically active organic donor compounds have been found to be sensitized by phenylsulfonyl or benzoyl substituted imidazo 4,5 b quinoxaline cyanine dyes. A novel class of electronically active organic donor compounds particularly useful in the present invention has the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is an aliphatic, aromatic, or mixed aliphatic aromatic group and Y is an aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic, or mixed aliphatic aromatic group. For example, R and Y may be independently selected from alkyl groups, benzyl groups, phenyl groups, naphthyl groups, anthracyl groups, etc., with such various substituents as alkoxy groups, amine groups, alkyl groups, hydroxyl groups, and halogen atoms thereon. These compounds have been found to be electron donor compounds and are useful in forming photoconductive layers when sensitized with cyanine dyes having an imidazo t4,5 b quinoxaline nucleus. They may be combined with polymeric binder materials to form photoconductive layers which are solid state molecular solution charge transport layers. The electron donor compounds have a reduced sensitivity to oxidation and oligomerization. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION All electronically active organic donor compounds, as they are known in the art, may be sensitized to various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum by sensitizing dyes selected from the group consisting of 1 imidazo 4,5 bl quinoxaline cyanine dyes, 2 phenylsulfonyl or benzoyl substituted indolenine dyes and 3 highly fluorinated aliphatic sulfonyl sensitizer dyes.Typical electronically active organic electron donor compounds are poly N vinylcarbazole, polyanthracene, oxadiazoles, pyrazolines, poly vinyl acenaphthalene , poly 2,9 methylene fluorene, polyvinyl ferrocene, polybenzocarbazole, polybenzoanthracene, and the like. Novel electronically active organic donor compounds useful in the practice of the present invention are bis benzocarbazoles trisubstitutedmethanes which may be represented by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein X is EMI5.1 wherein R is an aliphatic, aromatic or mixed aliphatic aromatic group and Y is an aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic or mixed aliphatic aromatic group. All of the compounds of the present invention may be synthesized by reactkng the appropriate N sustituted benzo alcarbazole or benzo b carbazole EMI5.2 with the correspondingly appropriate aldehyde EMI5.3 This process can be carried out in a solvent e.g., ethanol in the presence of an acid e.g., HC1 catalyst.The reaction product may be isolated by simple filtration and washing. For example, in the reaction of ll ethylbenzo a carbazole with benzaldehyde in ethanol in the presence of HC1 as a catalyst, the preferential reaction of the aldehyde at the 5 position of the ll benzo a carbazole and the insolubility of the reaction product EMI5.4 in ethanol, no oligomeric species are formed such as occur in a similar reaction with N ethyl carbazole. The reaction product is also stabilized against oxidation of the methine group by the rings ortho to point at which the methine group is bonded to the benzocarbazole nucleus. R mayt as previously stated, be selec ted from aliphatic, aromatic and mixed aliphatic aromatic groups . These groups may or may not be substituted. If they are substituted, it would be preferred that they be electron donating substituents although election withdrawing substituents may be tolerated. Preferably R is selected from alkyl groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably n alkyl groups of 2 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl groups such as phenyl or naphthyl groups, with phenyl groups preferred, alkaryl groups, for example benzyl groups, and allyl groups. Where the term group is used anywhere in the practice of the present invention, as opposed to the term radical , the possibility of substitution is specifically intended to be included within the definition of that term.For example, n alkyl radical may be only. of the formula CH2 nCH3 while n alkyl group may have hydrogen atoms on the n alkyl radical substituted with other moieties such as halogen atoms, hydroxyl radicals, alkoxy radicals, alkyl radicals, amine radicals, cyano radicals, etc. Specific examples of useful R moieties are ethyl, n butyl, n propyl, 4 methoxybutyl, 3 chloropropyl, 8 hydroxyoctyl, phenyl, benzyl, allyl, p ethylphenyl, m tert butylnaphthyl, p d iethylaminophenyl, stearyl, dodecyl, etc. R preferably has fewer than 20 carbon atoms, but may have up to 30 or more carbon atoms. The main influence of this group, except where electronic induction occurs because of a change of the nature of this group, is in the solubility of the compound. Y may, as previously stated, be selected from aliphatic, aromatic, and mixed aliphatic aromatic groups.These groups may or may not be substituted. Examples of useful moieties are methyl, ethyl, n pentyl, nonyl, stearyl, tolyl, anisyl m , p , and 0 , p chlorobenzyl, o bromobenzyl, p hydroxybenzyl, veratryl, isobutyl, terphthalyl, p octyloxybenzyl, p dimethylaminophenyl, t butyl, etc. Preferred Y moieties are phenyl, tolyl, anisyl, and benzyl groups because of their availability.As with group R, the main influence of this group, except with regard to electron induction effects, is on the solubility of the compounds. Preferably Y has 20 or fewer carbon atoms, but up to 30 may be readily tolerated.

Preferably the donor compound should be present as at least 25 or 35 percent by weight of the layer, and may comprise up to 100 by weight of the layer, excluding of course the sensitizer dye. The sensitizing dyes should be used in amounts which will increase the sensitivity of the composition. This is defined as an effective sensitizing amount of dye.Ordinarily .amounts of up to 10 by weight dye may be used, but certain constructions can be envisaged with as much as 90 by weight of dye and 10 by weight of organic electron donor compounds. Amounts of dye as small as 0.005 percent by weight can be useful. More preferred concentration ranges are between 0.05 and 5 percent by weight. The photosensitive materials of the present invention may also be useful as photoconductive toners, photovoltaic devices, organic semiconductors, and the like, and may use concentrations of organic electron donor compounds as low as 5 percent by weight. It has been surprisingly noted that the benzocarbazole aldehyde condensation products useful in the present invention are better charge transport materials than the corresponding benzocarbazoles by themselves. This is susprising because it is the benzocarbazole nucleus which is the electronically active portion of both molecules. Even when benzocarbazoles were used in reasonably higher molecular proportions to the binder than were the condensates, the condensates would still perform better. These and other aspects of the present invention will be shown in the following examples. Example 1Synthesis of bis 5,5 N ethylbenzolalcarbazolyl phenyl methane. Into a round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer were added 22.4 grams 0.1 mole of N ethylbenzo a carbazole and 5.3 grams 0.05 mole of benzaldehyde. Two hundred milliliters of ethanol acidified with 8 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid were then added. The mixture was stirred at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for sixteen hours. The insoluble, pure white product was isolated by filtration, washed with 100 ml of ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven. The yield was 95 of the theoretic calculation. Examples 2 17 In a manner substantially identical to that of the previous example, electronically active electron donor compounds of the present invention were obtained by condensing N ethylbenzo a carbazole with each of the following aldehydes in equimolar replacement for the benzaldehyde 2. p tolualdehyde 3. m tolualdehyde 4. o tolualdehyde 5. p anisaldehyde 6. m anisaldehyde 7. o anisaldehyde 8. p chlorobenzaldehyde 9. p bromobenzaldehyde 10. o bromobenzaldehyde 11. p hydroxybenzaldehyde 12. a naphthaldehyde 13. veratraldehyde 14. p octyloxybenzaldehyde 15. iso butyraldehyde 16. n nonylaldehyde 17. terphthaldehyde Examples 18 21 In a manner substantially identical to that ofExample 1, the following combinations of carbazoles and aldehydes were used to synthesize compounds of the present invention. 18. benzo a carbazole and benzaldehyde 19. N ethylbenzo b carbazole and benzaldehyde 20. N ethyldibenzo a carbazole and benzaldehyde 21. N ethyl 8 methoxybenzo a carbazole and benzaldehyde The addition of any of the compounds produced inExamples 1 21 to electrically inert polymeric binders formed positive charge transport layers. These layers could be formed on photoconductive layers and were capable of supporting injected photogenerated holes from the photoconductive layer and allowed the transport of these holes through the transport layer to selectively discharge the surface charge. Examples 22 39 Bulk sensitized photoreceptors were prepared by coating a solution consisting of 0.5 percent by weight solids of dye, 40 percent by weight of the same charge transport compound prepared in Example 1, and 59.5 percent of an organic solvent soluble polyester resin from a dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane 50 50 solution were coated at about lx10 4 m wet thickness onto an aluminum coated polyethyleneterephthalate film. The sample was air dried at 850C for approximately 15 minutes. The photoreceptor charged to a maximum voltage VO under positive corona charging and the exposure energy and wavelength of radiation necessary to reduce the charge to one half VO Vf with little dark decay was recorded.The device was also found to display high charge acceptance, low dark decay, and negligible fatigue upon cycling. The following dye compounds were used in these examples. The results are shown in Table I. Where the dyes had multiple peaks of absorbance, multiple readings were taken and the values for exposureenergy and wavelength respectively given.

The results of these experiments show that the sensitizing abilities of imidazo 4,5 b quinoxaline cyani , dyes for organic electron donors are improved by the substitution of the phenyl ring on the imidazo 4,5 b quinoxaline nieus with a phenylsulfonyl or benzoyl group. It must be noted, in order to appreciate the data, tt this is independent of the additional effect of countrions anions on the sensitizing ability of these cyanine dyes. As previously noted, certain counterions and especially perchlorate are preferred.As shown inExamples 35 and 36, the same quaternary nitrogen containing cyanine dye displayed improved sensitizing ability for organic electron donor compounds when the para toluenesulfonate counter ion was replaced with a perchlorate anion. However, comparisons are meaningful between, for example, the compounds of Examples 25 and 35 where the nitro groups of the prior art are replaced with phenylsulfonyl groups according to the present invention and the counterion is the same in both cases. As can be seen from the data, the exposure energy necessary to reach one half the initial voltage was lower for the phenylsulfonyl compound at all absorbance wavelengths. This shows the improvement in sensitivity alleged in the practice of the present invention. The comparison of compounds 25 to compounds 35 with only hydrogens on the phenyl ring and 24 with chlorine substituents on the phenyl ring show similar improvement at the absorption wavelengths evaluated. Example 25 shows improved properties at its wavelength of maximum absorbance 621 in comparison to the wavelength of maximum absorbance 650 for compound 29.
