# DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM COMPRISING A MEMORY ACCESS CONTROLLER WHICH IS PROVIDED FOR COMBINING DESCRIPTOR BITS OF DIFFERENT DESCRIPTORS ASSOCIATED WITH VIRTUAL ADDRESSES

## Abstract
A technique for changing attributes and or permission bits of a portion of a segment of a virtual memory address space by allowing the bitwise combination of attribute and or permission bits of its descriptors to yield an attribute and or permission for a portion of said address space which is different from the attribute and or permission for the whole segment of said memory address space.
