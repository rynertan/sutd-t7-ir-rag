# PURIFICATION OF NATURAL OILS WITH ALKALI METAL BOROHYDRIDES

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved alkali refining process for purifying natural oils such as the triglyceride oils. In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that the color, color stability, odor and or flavor of the refined oil is improved by refining the oil in the presence of an alkali metal borohydride. In addition, a reduction in the peroxide content of the refined oils has also been observed. Use levels of the alkali metal borohydride typically range from about 50 to about 2000 ppm, based on the weight of the oil.
