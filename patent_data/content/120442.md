# Device for adjusting the inclination of the light axis of headlamps of a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
A light axis adjusting device for use to the headlamps of motor vehicles comprising casings, a motor 23 arranged in the casings, a speed reduction mechanism arranged in the casings 21, 22 and functionally connected to the motor 23 and a hollow gear 27 respectively, to reduce the output of the motor 23 and transmit it to the hollow gear 27 a sleeve 28 inserted into the hollow gear 27 and moved linearly when the hollow gear 27 is rotated, a converting mechanism for converting the rotation of the hollow gear 27 to a force which causes the sleeve 28 to be moved linearly, and a driver shaft 29 passed through the sleeve to control and adjust the light axis of the headlamp, following the movement of the sleeve 28 .
