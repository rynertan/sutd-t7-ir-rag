# Rear view mirror for motor vehicles.

## Abstract
The mirror comprises a bracket 12 adapted to be secured to the vehicle and having a portion 16 with a part spherical outer surtace. The mirror housing 24 also has a portion 22 with a part spherical outer surface of opposite curvature to that of the portion 16 . An intermediate member has a part spherical portion 20 received between the two part spherical surfaces and a side portion 18 projecting laterally. A spring 32 applies a radial compress ive force to retain the part spherical surfaces in mutual engagement. Guide means 42 fast with the bracket con strains a first part of said side portion to remain in a fixed plane, while actuating means 46 56 in engagement with a second part of said side portion, are operative to cause displacement of said second part both in a direction parallel to said fixed plane and in a direction perpendicular thereto.

## Description
REAR VIEW MIRROR FOR MOTOR VEHICLES This invention relates to an exterior rear view mirror for a vehicle which is adjustable from the interior of the vehicle. Exterior rear view mirrors which are adjustable from the interior of the vehicle are generally of two types. One type has a housing which is fixed relative to the vehicle and a mirror of which the orientation is adjustable relative to the housing. In the other type, the orientation of the housing is adjustable and the mirror is fixed therein. The present invention is concerned with a mirror of the latter type. According to the invention, an exterior rear view mirror for a vehicle comprises a bracket adapted to be secured to the vehicle and having a portion with a part spherical outer surface, a mirror housing, an intermediate member connected to the mirror housing and having a part spherical surface of the same radius as and opposite curvature to the part spherical surface of the bracket so as to engage therewith and a side portion projecting laterally from said part spherical surface, resilient means for applying a radial compressive force to retain said part spherical surfaces in mutual engagement, guide means fast with the bracket for constraining a first part of said side portion to remain in a fixed plane, and actuating means in engagement with a second part of said side portion and operative to cause displacement of said second part both in a direction parallel to said fixed plane and in a direction perpendicular thereto, the centre of the part spherical surface of the intermediate member being off set from an immaginary straight line between said first and second parts thereof. Thus, if the mirror is mounted on a vehicle with said fixed plane substantially horizontal, displacement of the second part of the intermediate member in such plane causes lateral adjustment of the mirror while displacement thereof in a direction perpendicular thereto causes vertical adjustment of the mirror. The mirror housing may be integral with the intermediate member. However, to enable the mirror to fold back flat against the side of the vehicle if it is struck by an object moving past the vehicle, ihe mirror housing preferably has a portion with a partspherical outer surface in engagement with a part spherical surface on the intermediate member with the same radius but opposite curvature.This permits angular movement of the mirror housing relative to the intermediate member about an axis perpendicular to the aforesaid fixed plane. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a transverse cross sectional view of a rear view mirror assembly in accordance with the invention, and Figure 2 is a plan view of the mirror assembly shown inFigure 1 with a top cover removed. Referring to Figure 1, a rear view mirror 10 has a bracket 12 mounted so as to project horizontally from the body 14 of a vehicle.The bracket 12 has a part spherical portion 16 with a concave upper surface. An intermediate member 18 has a part spherical portion 20, the concave surface of which engages with the upper convex surface of the portion 16 of the bracket 12. The upper convex surface of the partspherical portion 20 of the intermediate member 18 engages with a concave projection 22 forming part of the housing 24 of the mirror 10.A bolt 26 extends through three abuting members 16, 20 and 22 with its head resting on the upper surface of the projection 22. The hole in the portion 16 of the bracket 12 is over size so as to permit limited radial movement of the intermediate member 18 and the housing 24 relative thereto, as well as angular movement about the axis of the bolt 26.Below the member 16, the bolt 26 carries a part spherical washer 30 which is biased upwardly by a spring 32 so as to maintain the various part spherical surfaces in engagement with one another, a nut 34 against which the spring 32 abuts, permitting the friction between these surfaces to be adjusted as desired. The rest of the intermediate member 18 projects from the part spherical portion 20 thereof in a plane generally perpendicular to the axis of the bolt 26. As can best be seen from Figure 2, one corner of the projecting part of the intermediate member 18 carries a cylindrical protuberance 40 which engages in a horizontal channel in a guide member 42 which is secured to the bracket 12. Thus movement of this corner of the intermediate member 18 out of a horizontal plane is inhibited by the guide member 42 while angular movement about the bolt 28 is permitted. The other corner of the projecting portion of the intermediate member 18 carries a socket 44 of a ball and socket coupling. The ball 46 of this coupling is mounted on the end of an arm 48 which projects radially from a vertical rod 50 which is journaled in bearings in the bracket 12 for both axial and angular movement relative to its longitudinal axis which is vertical. An operating lever 52 is pivotally coupled to the rod 50 for movement about a horizontal axis. One end of the lever 52 carries a ball 54 which is received in a horizontal guide channel 56 secured to the mounting bracket 12. The other end of the lever 52 projects into the inside of the vehicle and carries an operating knob 58. In use, when it is desired to adjust the angle of the mirror 10 in the horlzontal direction, the knob 58 is moved horizontally.This rotates the rod 50 about is axis so that the arm 48 causes a corresponding angular movement of the intermediate member 18, about the axis of the bolt 26, relative to the bracket 12. Frictional engagement between the upper surface of the part spherical portion 20 of the intermediate member and the lower part spherical surface of the projection 22 f the mirror housing 24 results in the latter moving with the intermediate member 18. When the mirror 10 is to be adjusted in the vertical direction, the knob 58 is moved vertically. The engagement of the ball 54 on the other end of the lever 52 in the channel 56 has the result that the rod 50 also moves vertically, carrying the socket 44 with it. Consequently, the intermediate member 18 performs an angular movement about a horizontal axis through the cylindrical member 40 which is constrained by the channel in the member 42 and the centre of curvature of the various part spherical surfaces. This angular movement causes vertical adjustment of the mirror 10. Should the mirror housing 24 be subject t impact in the horizontal direction, the part spherical projection 22 thereof moves about the axis of the bolt 26 relative to the intermediate member 18 through a sufficient angle to enable the mirror housing 24 to be folded flat against the side of the vehicle. In Figure 1 a cover 60 is shown extending from the vehicle body 14 to the mirror housing 24. This cover 60 is omitted fromFigure 2 to enable the intermediate member 18 to be seen.
