# Improved structure of power supply wirings in semiconductor integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprises a first circuit section positioned in a center portion of the substrate, a second cir cuit section provided in the peripheral portion of the sub strate, and first to third power supply main wiring layers on the substrate, The first wiring layer supplys a first voltage such as ground potential to the second circuit section. The second wiring layer supplys a second voltage such as Vcc potential to the second circuit section. The third wiring layer supplys the first voltage to the first circuit section. The de vice further comprises a MOS type capacitor having upper and lower electrodes. The upper electrode of the capacitor is connected to the second wiring layer, and the lower elec trode of the capacitor is connected at its end parts to the first and third wiring layers such that both wiring layers are elec trically connected each other. Such a device can decrease the surge current induced in the wiring layers by the ca pacitor. Further, signal lines can be continuously formed with low electrical resistance on an insulating layer above the capacitor. Therefore, the access time of the device can be reduced.
