# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying apparatus comprising a rotary drum 12 disposed within a housing 2 and carrying a photosensitive member. The drum includes a shaft 64 , bearing members 66 having a circular peripheral surface and mounted respectively on two opposite sides of the shaft 64 , and a drum member fixed to the shaft between the bearing members and having the photosensitive member on at least part of its peripheral surface. The apparatus includes a developing device 24 for developing a latent electrostatic image formed on the photosensitive member. The develop ing device has a frame disposed adjacent the rotary drum and having two side plates 86 spaced from each other by a fixed distance. A cylindrical rotary sleeve 96 is mounted rotatably between the side plates 86 of the frame and extends parallel to the rotary drum 12 , the sleeve being for holding developer on its peripheral surface. A pair of spaced apart, guide and members 62 are disposed within the housing. Each member 62 is formed with a shaft support opening 76 comprised by a recess 78 and with a main guide surface 80 extending from the lower end of the recess 78 . During insertion of the drum 12 into the housing, the peripheral surfaces of the bearing members 66 are moved along the main guide surfaces 80 so as to enter the recesses 78 . The free ends of projecting pieces 88 formed on the side plates 86 are caused to abut the peripheral surfaces of the bearing members 66 whereby to retain the drum in position within the housing and to set the distance between the peripheral surface of the drum member and the peripher al surfaces of the sleeve 96 of the developing device to a predetermined value.
