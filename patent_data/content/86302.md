# Polyethylene terephthalate film, process for the production thereof and magnetic recording medium therefrom.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a polyethylene terephthalate film having the sum of F 5 values in longitudinal and transverse direc tions of 3500 to 5000 kg cmÂ², absolute shrinkages in lon gitudinal and transverse directions at 100 C of up to 2.5 and an amorphous orientation factor of 1.5 to 0.5, a pro cess for the production of the film and a magnetic recording medium having the film as a base. A polyethylene tere phthalate film useful as a magnetic recording medium having super high tensile strengths in both longitudinal and trans verse directions and a low heat shrinkage is provided, while it has been considered that such properties could not be obtained in polyethylene terephthalate films.
