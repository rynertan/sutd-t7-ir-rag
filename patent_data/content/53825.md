# High impact, high modulus fiber reinforced aromatic carbonate polymers.

## Abstract
High impact, high modulus thermoplastic molding com positions comprise a an aromatic carbonate polymer b a fibrous reinforcing agent essentially free of any sizing agent and c a small amount of a polysiloxane having a substan tial content of Si H bonds. This invention is directed to an improved polycarbonate composition of an aromatic carbonate polymer in intimate admixture with an unsized fibrous reinforcing agent and a small amount of a hydrogen siloxane.
