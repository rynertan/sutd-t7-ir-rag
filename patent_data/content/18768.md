# Apparatus of joining together optical fibres.

## Abstract
Optical fibres are welded together by positioning the end parts in vacuum chucks 10, 11 . Piezo electric elements force the chucks 10, 11 towards one another. The piezo electric elements are put into operation by the power supply of a welding arc 31, 32 operating between the chucks 10, 11 . The heated fibre end parts are thus removed together to ensure a good welded joint.
