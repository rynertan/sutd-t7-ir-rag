# Tubular solenoid.

## Abstract
A low cost tubular solenoid is formed with a drawn case 20 in which the pole portion 22 forming the base of the solenoid is an integral part of the case. A coil bobbin 25 is formed by the injection molding of plastics material and is provided with an integral wall 30 which is posi tioned in abutting relation with the inside surface of the pole portion, thereby forming a stop surface for the sole noid plunger and effectively spacing the plunger from the base. The plunger is guided on the internal surfaces of the bobbin 25 and a spun hollow sheet metal bushing 40 is captured by the inwardly turned end 45 of the case in telescopic relation with the bobbin, and is formed with threads 46 which receive a sheet metal retaining nut 48 . Terminal leads are attached to the bobbin and extend through apertures formed in a bobbin extension 36 eli minating the need for the placement of coil lead in wires.
