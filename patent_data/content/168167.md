# Catalysis using supported strong base catalysts and supported catalysts.

## Abstract
A catalyst suitable for use in reactions catalysed by strong base is provided. The catalyst comprises an organic compound containing a Group VA element for example an amine or phosphine supported on a solid which is insoluble in the reaction mixture. The catalyst may be activated by treatment with an epoxide. Catalysts in which the amine is an amidine or a guanidine are particularly effective.
