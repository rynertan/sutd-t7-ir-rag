# METHANOL CONVERSION USING REACTIVATED ZEOLITE CATALYST MATERIALS

## Abstract
A method of converting methanol into hydrocarbons comprises contacting methanol under conversion conditions with a substantially deactivated ZSM 5 type catalyst which has been reactivated by contact with an activating agent comprising ammonia and steam. Said reactivation occurs at temperatures from 100 to 1000 C to the extent that at least 10 crystallinity is preserved in the activated product.
