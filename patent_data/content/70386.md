Example 12Polymer of 2,2 Hexamethylenebis 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl imino bis 4,6 diallyloxy l,3,5 triazine A mixture of 2,2 hexamethy1enebis 2,2,6 6tet ramethyl 4 piperidinyl imino bis 4,6 diallylOxyl,3,5 triazine 8.0 grams and dioxane 15 mls is purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes and 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile 1.0 gram is added thereto. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated at 600C for 68 hours while passing a stream of nitrogen above the surface of the mixture. An additional 0.5 gram of 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile is then added to the mixture and heating is continued at 600C for 24 hours. An additional 0.5 gram of 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile is added to the mixture and heating is continued at 600C for another 24 hours.The reaction mixture is then poured into petroleum ether 200 mls and the resultant solid is recovered by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven. The product softens at 1200C and decomposes at 156 1600C It has a molecular weight of 3000. Example 13Polymer of 2,2 Hexamethylenebis 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl imino bis 4 diallylamino 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazine 2,2 Hexamethylenebistt2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl imino bis 4 diallylamino 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazine 10 grams is dissolved in dry dioxane 15 grams at 40 C and the solution is purged with.dry nitrogen for 30 minutes. The solution is heated to 60oC, under a nitrogen atmosphere, and 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile 0.5 gram is added thereto. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 600C for 24 hours. At this point, additional 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile 0.25 gram is added to the reaction mixture and stirring is continued at 600C for another 24 hours.An additional 0.25 gram of 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile is added and stirring is continued at 600C for another 24 hours.The reaction mixture is then added to petroleum ether 200 mls and the resulting white precipitate is recovered by filtration and dried under vacuum to obtain 5.6 grams of product which softens at 1100C and effervesces at 160 1700C. Examples 14 16 Testing in Polypropylene The compounds of Examplesll 13 0.25 gram are separately dry blended with a mastermix of 100 grams of unstabilized polypropylene Pro faxe 6401 and 0.1 gram of a processing antioxidant, 2,4,6 tri t butylphenol. The blend is milled at 350 3700F for five minutes, and then compression molded at 4000F into a film 4 5 mils thick. The film and a control film, identically prepared without the compound under test, are exposed to a xenon arc in an Atlas Weather Ometere until they fail. A film is considered as having failed when the carbonyl content of the infrared absorption spectrum increases by 0.10 weight percent, a generally accepted point of film embrittlement. The data in Table It show the number of hours required to increase the carbonyl content by 0.1 by weight for the compounds under test and a control film.
