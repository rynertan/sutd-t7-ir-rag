## Description
PHENOLIC FOAM OF INCREASED RESILIENCE AND PROCESS FOR MAKING IT The present invention relates to phenolic foams and a process for their production. It is well known that foamed products can be made from the products of condensing a phenol with an aldehyde, usually formaldehyde. These foamed products phenolic foams are rigid naterials. If a force is applied to them they will either resist any change in shape or, if the force is sufficiently great, they will be irreversibly deformed. Phenolic foams which have some degree of resilience, i.e. the ability to return spontaneously to their original shape when the deforming force has been removed would be desirable. However it has not been possible up to now to make such foams. It is disclosed in US 3 063 953 that the physical properties of aminoplast foams may be modified by subjecting them to a uniform compressive stress against opposed planar surfaces, followed by periods of relaxation to permit substantially complete recovery of the foamed body. The compression and relaxation treatment is said to give a foam of increased resiliency and compliability. The process ofUS 3 063 953 is shown applied to a urea formaldehyde foam. Aminoplast foams such as urea fornaldehyde foams differ considerably from phenoplast resins such as phenol formaldehyde resins. European patent application EP 17671 discloses the production of elastic foams based on melanine formaldehyde resins. The use of a compression step to increase elasticity is mentioned. Phenolic foams however are particularely rigid and the man skilled in the art would see no reason to believe that a crushing step would have any beneficial effect on such very rigid foams. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a resilient phenolic foam article. Preferably the resilient foam article has a maxims recoverable compression of over 5 , more preferably the maximum recoverable compression is over 10 , more preferably over 30X. By maximum recoverable compression throughout this specification is neant the maximum percentage by which a linear dimension can be reduced by the application of compressive force and still return to the original value when the compressive force is removed. According to another aspect of the present invention the process for increasing the resilience of a phenolic foam article comprises subjecting the foam article to a crushing step by applying a crushing force and recovering the phenolic foam article from the crushing step. The phenolic foam to which the process of the present invention is applied may be any phenolic foam. Methods of making phenolic foams are well known. They are usually made by preparing a phenolic resin, incorporating a blowing agent, a catalyst to give a cured product, and optionally a surfactant. The mixture may be treated so as to form an uncured froth which is then caused to cure by heating as disclosed inGB 1 580 565. In this connection it should be noted that the term 1phenolic foam refers to the cured final product and not to the uncured froth which may be obtained at some intermediate stage in the production of the phenolic foam. In the preferred process for making phenolic foam the curing of the resin and the activation of the blowing agent to give the foam take place in the same step. The phenolic resin used can be a novolak resin, in which case it is necessary to incorporate a hardener such as a polyamine.Preferably the phenolic resin is a resole which can be cured by the application of heat without the necessity of adding a hardener. The phenolic resin may be prepared from phenol, or a substituted phenol e.g. alkyl phenols, styrenated phenols, cashew nut shell liquid, and may be modified e.g. by the incorporation of urea.Phenolic resins may be nodified by urea by reacting a phenol and formaldehyde and then adding urea. The urea reacts mainly with methylol groups produced by the reaction of the phenol and formaldehyde. Phenolic resins modified in this way have different properties from urealfon aldehyde resins The aldehyde component of the phenolic resin is preferably ormaldehyde or a substance which yields formaldehyde under the conditions used to form the resin, e.g. a polymer of formaldehyde. The blowing agent may for example be a low boiling liquid which boils at a temperature below that reached during the curing of the roan. Examples of blowing agents are halohydrocarbons, e.g. fluorochlorohydrocarbons and low molecular weight alkanes, e.g. pentane. The catalysts which may be used to cure the phenolic foam are vell known and may for example be strong mineral acids e.g. sulphuric acid and organic acids e.g. toluene sulphonic acid. Although as stated above the process may be applied to any phenolic foam to increase the resiliency of the foam we have found that particularly good results are obtained if the phenolic foam to which the process is applied has a specific cell structure. Phenolic foams can be made consisting of a three dimension branched strut structure. The spaces between struts may be closed by continuous phenolic resin membranes giving a closed cell phenolic foam. It is also possible to make phenolic foams in which these membranes contain large gaps or tears or are substantially absent. The foams which it is preferred to use in the process are phenolic foams comprising 1 a three dimensional network of struts and 2 membranes extending between the struts to define foam cells, the membranes having a plurality of substantially uniformly disposed perforations. Preferably there are at least thirty perforations in each membrane, more preferably at least 100, for example more than 200. The perforations are substantially uniformly disposed on the membranes i.e. on the entire surface of each membrane. There is therefore substantially no individual large breaks or openings in the membrane snitch would cause the openings as whole to be non uniformly disposed. Preferably no opening in a membrane has an area greater than 5 , more preferably 2 of the area of the membrane. It will be realised that the foam may contain a number of defective foam cells i.e. which do not have membranes with a plurality Cr substantially uniformly disposed openings. However providing a ajori y of cells have membranes which satisfy this condition, eg. at east 70 , preferably at least 85 , then the foam will given phenol roars of enhanced resilience. The preferred phenolic foams for use as starting materials in the resent invention may for example be made by the carrying out of a conventional foaming process using a phenol formaldehyde resole and using an alkali metal alkybenzene sulphonate e.g. sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, as a surfactant. The quantity of alkali etal alkylbenzene sulphonate may for example be 0.001 to 10 , more preferably 0.001 to 5 based on weight of phenol aldehyde resin. It is believed that optimum results in the process of the present invention are obtained by the choice of foams of suitable startIng densities. The foam subjected to the crushing step preferably has a density not greater than 25 kg m3. The crushing step used in the process of the present invention consists in subjecting the foam to pressure. The phenolic foam is preferably compressed sufficiently to compress at least part of the foam by not less than 10 , more preferably by 20 to 30 . The compression is measured linearly in the direction in which the force is applied. It is preferred to apply the crushing force in such a way that a given compression is obtained over a comparatively long period of tine. Thus it is preferred to carry out the crushing step so as to reduce the thickness of the foam article, in the direction in which the crushing force is applied, by at least 15 in not less than 15 seconds. The crushing step ray be carried out by any convenient method. The crushed foam article must be recovered from the crushing step. Thus the pressure applied to the phenolic foam must be sufficient to crush the foam, so as to give increased flexibility, but must not be such as to destroy the integrity of the foam article by breaking it into pieces. The limits of pressure within which the process can be operated can be readily determined by simple tests. The article to which the crushing step is applied may be a simple rectangular foam block or may be a moulded article of more complex shape. The pressure required to give the required crushing may be provided in any convenient way. Thus the article may be passed between rollers or may be introduced into a press. The pressure may be applied directly to the article by a fluid. Pressure may be applied to only part of the surface of the article where increased flexibility is required only in part of the article. Different parts of the article may be subjected to different pressures. The foam articles of the present invention may be used for various purposes. Thus the resilience obtained may be used to provide improved push fit characteristics. Thus an article may be compressed so as to fit into a space and on release of the compression it will expand into engagement with the surrounding material. The foam articles produced by the process of the present invention may be used in packaging to give packaging materials having good impact absorbtion properties. They have potential application in the construction of seats in environments in which there is a high fire risk. The Figure is a photomicrograph of a sample of phenolic foam which is a preferred starting material for preparing resilient phenolic foams in accordance with the present invention. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following examples.Example 1 A rectangular block of phenolic foam was prepared by conventional techniques from a phenol formaldehyde resole in the presence of 0.1 , based on weight of resole, of sodium alkylbenzene sulphonate. The resole used was a commercially available one sold under the designation Cellobond J20 1042L Cellobond is a Trade Mark by BP Chemicals Limited. The resulting block of foam, which had a density of 35 kg m3 and thickness of 100 mm was placed in a hydraulic press and a steadily increasing hydraulic pressure was applied to the platens of the press. The crushing step was carried out 8lowly i.e.over about 10 20 seconds for maximum crushing until a predetermined degree of compression was reached. The pressure was then released. T e foam block was removed as an intact block. The maximum recoverable compression of the foam block was determined in the direction of its thickness by applying a pressure to the opposed faces tze foam block sufficient to compress it by varying amounts and rtasuring the maximum extent to which the foam block could be compressed in the direction of its thickness and still fully recover its original thickness i.e. its thickness after crushing but before testing. The results are given in Table 1.
