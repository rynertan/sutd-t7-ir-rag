# A method for high contrast development of a silver halide photographic material.

## Abstract
A silver halide photographic material containing a hydra zine derivative of the general formula I R₁ NHNHCHO I wherein R₁ is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, is de veloped with high contrast by the use of an aqueous alkaline developer having a pH value of 10.5 to 12.3 and comprising the following components 1 through 5 1 a dihydroxybenzene type developing agent 2 a p aminophenol type developing agent 3 at least 0.3 mol l of a sulfite preservative 4 0.05 to 0.30 mol l of an alkanolamine of the general for mula II C₂H₅ ₂N R₂ II where R₂ is a hydroxyalkyl group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms and 5 10 ⁴ to 10 ² mol l of a mercapto compound of the general formula III
