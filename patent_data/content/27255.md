# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium which comprises a base material and a magnetic layer provided on its surface, said magnetic layer comprising metallic magnetic particles, a binder and a salt of lanolin fatty acid wherein the oxidation resistance of the metallic magnetic particles is highly im proved and the metallic magnetic particles are in a good dis persion state so that the magnetic recording medium shows an increased maximum magnetic flux density.
