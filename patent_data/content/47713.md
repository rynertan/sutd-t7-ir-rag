# Inert gas thermonuclear fuel, fuel preparation apparatus and system for extracting useful work from the fuel.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a reciprocating engine which uses an inert gas as fuel, the apparatus for preparing the fuel and the fuel itself. The engine comprises a closed chamber 41A, 41B formed by a head 17A, 17B having a generally concave depression therein and an axially movable piston 39A, 39B having a generally semitoroidal depression in its upper surface, a plurality of exciting and igniting electrodes 63, 65 extending into the closed chamber, and a conductive discharge point 85. In operation the discharge point 85 is located in one end position of the piston generally intermediate and equidistantly of the electrodes, whereas in the other end position the discharge point is disposed at a substantial distance from the electrodes. The apparatus for preparing the inert gas mixture comprises a nonconductive and nonmagnetic mixing chamber 261 which is connected by means of nonconductive and nonmagnetic tubing means B23, B33, B35, B47, B48 to inert gas sources 205, 247, 249, 283, 281, ionization means 221, 239, 241, 271, 273 respectively inserted into the tubing means connected to the inert gas sources and means for supplying electrical current to said ionization means. The fuel comprises a mixture of inert gases including helium, neon, xenon, krypton and argon.
