# Technique for monitoring galvo angle.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a radiant energy optoelectronic position monitor system which detects the angular position of a galva nometer mirror beam scanner gm used in an optical disk memory arrangement. Using a single infra red monitor beam, angular motion is converted to linear displacement of an image on a detector cell 31 so as to produce a corresponding electrical signal. This, signal is presented to a processing circuit with an analog divid er to normalize output scale factor. The result is a high gain electrical circuit for recovering output signals in an environ ment with strong magnetic interference. Such a position sensor is described as especially apt for use in a three beam laser optical system comprising a writ ing beam and two reading beams all incident on the same track of a rotating disk optical recording medium. One of these read ing beams is incident on the track ahead of the writing beam so as to serve as a read before write beam, while the other reading beam is incident on the track behind the recording beam so as to serve as a read after write beam.
