# Nonfogging rearview outside mirror for motor driven vehicles.

## Abstract
The mirror body is provided with an inside collector 7 having a progressive tapering into which air is injected by effect of the vehicle motion through a rear grid 5 taking, when advancing, a power increase to get out as an air jet with continuous effect sidewise on the mirror 4 . The air jet aiming is performed by a deviation relief 9 on the mirror which permits to project the jet with grazing effect, thus allowing to remove the water particle formed on the wall 4 .

## Claims
CLAIMS I Nonfogging rearview mirror for motor driven vehicles,characterized by the fact the envelope is foreseen with an inside conversion collector having a progressive tapering towards the ou tlet,in which the air is injected by effect of the vehicle moti on,through a grid fitted on the rear side on which the air hits. In this collector,the air progressively takes a power increase which permits its jet outlet.This one is aimed sidewise on the visualization wall by effect of the deflection relief foreseen on the frame.In this way,while the car is running,the invention permits to determine a continuous jet with grazing effect capable of removing the water particles from the mirror. 2 Nonfogging rearview mirror for motor driven vehicles,according to the above claim,characterized by the fact that the version foresees envelope I bearing the mirror plate 4 on stabilizing reliefs 2 and 3.The system foresees grid 5 with parallel openings 6 which internally lets the air into conversion collector 7 with opening 8,through which tha air jet hits on deviation projection 9 and arrives with grazing effect on the visualization wall 4. 3 Nonfogging outer rearview mirror for motor driven vehicles,ac cording to the previous claims,characterized by the fact that the employ of the conversion collector 7,with progressive section reduction,allows a power increase to the outgoing air jet. 4 Nonfogging outer rearview mirror for motor driven vehicles,ac cording to the previous claims,characterized by the fact that the grazing effect on the wall of visualization is enabled by the deviation angle 9. 5 Execution forms as described and illustrated by the drawing of Table I.

## Description
onfoggi ng rearview outside mirror for motor driven vehicles. The invention refers to a demisting device allowing to maintain the functionality of the rearview mirrors in the motor driven vehicles even in presence of fog and rain, by using the atmosphe re air to generate an air jet with continuous grazing effect on the visualization wall and performing the removal of the water particles. The functionality of the rearview mirror is indispen sable for the efficient drive of the motor vehicle since it allows to watch the traffic on the surpassing side.At present there are no means known performing cleaning of the visualisation wall in transit condition, and this implies the necessity of doing so by the driver while he is driving. Nore over the dimming that occurs in presence of fog or rain takes place in precarious conditions for the driver, namely when the utmost necessity occurs to have the rearview mirror in efficient conditions.According to the invention, the proceeding permits the integral solution of the problem by means of a contrivance that uses the vehicle movement to generate an air jet with continuous effect performing in this way the removal of the water particles form ed on the visualization walls. This is possible thanks to the envelope inside fitted with a conversion collector with progres sive tapering towards the outlet into which the air is inject ed by effect of the vehicle movement, through the grid fitted on the rear wall on which the air is hitting. In the said collector, the air takes a prograssive power increase which permits a jet outlet. This is aimed sidewise at the visualisation wall by the deviation relief foreseen on the frame.In this way, when the car is running, the invention permits to remove the water particles from the mirror with continuous grazing effect.An execution version is ilustrated in an indicative way the draw ings of Table I, where Fig. I is the mirror section showing the conversion collector with direction arrows indicating the air pas sage from the grid in progressive tapering of the duct on the ou tlet opening on the mirror wall and employ of the deflector bear ing the.jet with grazing effect on the mirror wall. Eigv is the prospectic view of a mirror showing the dashed grid on the rear wall and the conversion collector. The version foresees envelopeI bearing the mirror plate 4 on stabilizing reliefs 2 and 3. The system foresees grid 5 with parallel openings 6 which introduces air into conversion collector 7 with opening 8, through which the air jet hits on relief of deflection 9 and gets on the wall 4 wi th grazing effect.Practically, the particular of the execution, the mirror body fo rm, that of the grid and of the conversion collector may be differently be carried out. In an analoguous way, the aiming of the.air jet may be foreseen differently. The device may be fitTed on the car body in many ways.
