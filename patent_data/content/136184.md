## Description
IMPROVED INSULATED BUILDING BLOCK BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Insulated masonry building block construction has varied widely in form. Loose insulation is sometimes introduced in situ after a wall has been constructed or partially constructed of masonry building blocks. Insulation has also been molded direct ly in the cavities of such blocks. Further, various special types of blocks have been provided with insulation mounted inter nally or secured externally. One form of block insulation, which has gained wide commercial acceptance, is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,885,363 to Richard W. Whittey entitled INSULATED BLOCK and in U.S. PatentNo. 4,027,445, to David L. Nickerson entitled INSULATED BLOCK.As disclosed therein, preformed insulating inserts are introduced to the cavities of conventional masonry building blocks at the block plant after the blocks have been formed and the blocks may thereafter be handled during transport and construction in the conventional manner of uninrulated blocks. Obvious and substantial advantages in eificiency, convenience and economy are thus achieved. Even with the last above mentioned insulating technique, however, the u Values of the combined building block and insert may not be as low as desired for some installations. The core areas are effectively insulated by the insulating inserts but the mortar joints and the transverse webs, usually three in number and, extending between inner and outer side sections, result in substantial heat transfer conductively therethrough. To date there has been no effective solution to this problem. There are also of course other known problems with masonry building blocks such as the migration of moisture therethrough. It i the general object of the present invention to provide an improved insulated masonry building block wherein a significant lmprovement in U Values is achieved in the range 0.05 to 0,10 BTU FT2HRF , wherein the insulation is applied at the block plant with substantial savings in cost, and wherein substantial improvement is achieved in reducing moisture migration or transmission through the blocks. SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION In fulfillment of the foregoing object, a preformed masonry building block is provided with a pair of laterally spaced longitudinally extending vertically disposed side walls each of a generally rectangular configuration viewed laterally and each of generally rectangular cross sectional configuration.The walls cooperatively define a vertically open generally rectangular space therebetween and a pair of vertically disposed generally rectangular and laterally extending connecting arms engage the respective inner surfaces of the walls whereby to secure the walls in relatively fixed position0 The arms are spaced longitudinally from each other and from the ends of the walls and each arm includes a vertically open notch adjacent a side wall for receiving an insulating insert.The insulating insert is of a light weight thermal insulating and fire retarding material and has an external configuration which is generally rectangular with a pair of spaced vertically open notches respectively for receiving portions of the connecting arms of a block when the inert is disposed internally of and adjacent a wall of the block and entered vertically in the notches in the arms of the block. The insert is generally coextensive with the side walls of the block and has no portion thereof which projects beyond the walls of the block when so disposed in the block.Thus, the insert can be introduced to the interior of the block at the block plant and with the insert confined within the outline of the block, transport to the construction site can be readily effected without damage to the insert. Both the block side walls and the insulating insert have overlap and interlock means along at least each marginal end portion thereof so as to provide for overlapping and interlocking relationship between each block wall and insert and horizontally.contiguous block walls and inserts in a structural wall or the like formed of similar blocks and inserts. The overlap and interlock means take the form of narrow reduced thickness margin al flanges extending along the edges of the side walls of the block and the edges of the generally rectangular insulating in Sert. More particularly, the flanges on the insert result from a multi part planar construction thereof.The insert is divided along a plane substantially at its midpotnt and parallel with its major area opposing surfaces and the parts thereof are adapted for relative slidable movement so as to be arranged in a first position wherein both parts reside wholly within the rectangular outline of the side walls of an associated block In a second position of the insert parts, one of the parts is moved relative to the other in a sliding movement so as to project vertically into overlapping and interlocking relationship with a vertically d esnt insert.When the said one part of the insert hes been so moved and when similar parts of adjacent inserts are so moved, the insulating inserts enjoy 9 quadri laterel overlapping and interlocking relationship with all contiguous insert. thereabout in a structural wall formed of similar blocks and inserts. This results in a substantial improvement in insulating properties with total insert coverage of the side walls of the block except for the limited connecting arm cross sectional areas. The crosssectional areas are so designed as not to exceed about 108 of the total face or wall area of the building block and a substantial improvement in U Value is thus achieved.The overlapping and interlocking of the inserts also substantially reduces moisture transmission or migration through the building blocks. It is also to be noted that the multi part sliding inserts accommodate building blocks having flanges at opposite ends and a flange at the top thereof tut with a flat bottom surface. The building blocks are thus adapted for molding in conventional molds and using conventional molding techniques and yet the advantages of insert installation at the block plant, transport with no projecting portions or overhanging of inserts, and eventual use of the inserts in quadri lateral overlapping and interlocking engagement is achieved.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Directional and or geometrical terms such as top , bottom side , lateral , 11horizontal , longitudinal , vertical1,, ete. are used freely hereinbelow but it will be understood that such terminology is employed for convenience of description only and is not to be regarded as in any way limiting the invention in the specification and the claims which follow. Referring particularly to Fig, 1, an improved insulated building block indicated generally at 10 has a pair of laterally spaced longitudinally extending vertically disposed side walls 12,12 each of generally rectangular cross sectional configura tion. The wall. 12,12 cooperatively define a vertically open generally rectangular space therebetween and a pair of vertically disposed generally rectangular and laterally extending connecting arms 14,14 extend across said space whereby to secure the walls in relatively fixed position.The arms 14,14 are spaced longitudinally from each other and from the ends of the walls as best illustrated in Fig, 2, and each arm includes a vertically open notch 16, Pig, 3 and 4, adjacent a side wall 12 for receiving an insulating insert indicated generally at 18. The notch 16 opens upwardly as shown and such construction is presently preferred. Teach arm 14 ir also shown with a small arcuate notch 20 which is spaced downwardly from the top of an adjacent wall 12 and which may serve as a shelf for the horizontal extension of cables, con dusts, reinforcing bars, etc. The insulating insert is is of a light weight thermal insulating and fire retarding material and has an external configuration which is generally rectangular as illustrated. The insert also hab a pair of spaced vertically downwardly open notches 22,22 Figs. 1 and 2 respectively for receiving portions of the arms 14,14 when the insert is disposed internally of end adjacent a wall thereof and entered vertically in the notches 16,16 in the arms 14,14, Fig. 4, 8. As will be observed in Figs. 1 3, the insert 18 is constructed in two relatively slideble parts split along a plane parallel with the planes of its inner and outer faces. Thus, a lofthand portion of the insert 18a and a righthand portion or part thereof l8b may be identical in rectangular configuration or plan form as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3e Referring particularly to Fig. 3, it will observed that the insert 18 may be moved downwardly to a position shown in broken line form within the block 10 wherein the two portions or parts lBa and lBb of the multi pazt insert are aligned or in a first position.In such first position of the insert parts, the insert is contained wholly within the outline of the side walls 12,12 of the block and there ii no projection whatever of the insert beyond such side walls. Thus, in this position of the insert parts, the block and the insert may be transported in the usual manner with no danger of damage to the insert during transport. Still referring to Figs. 2 and 3 it will be observed that a notch 22a in the righthand insert 18a is slightly deeper than the notches 22,22 in the aforementioned or lefthand side lSb of the insert. Two such notches 22a,22a are provided and are aligned with the notches 22,22 in the part 19b and the depth of the notches controls the downward movement of the part 18a as illustrated in Fig. 4. The notch 16 has a slightly elevated righthand portion in Pig. 3 but it will be apperent that the said notch may have a flat bottom portion and the degree of downward movement of the part 18a may be controlled merely by the depth of the notches in the said part. As shown in Pig. 4, the amount or degree of downward movement of the part 18e is approximately 3 8 of an inch and this is dimensioned so as to correspond with the conventional thickness of a layer of mortar between building blocks. As best Illustrated in Fig. 8, the downward movement of the parts 18a of the inserts 18 result in overlapping and interlocking relationship between inserts of vertically adjacent block and insert units. The lowermost insert part iSa is moved downwardly so as to protect slightly beneath the bottom surface of the lowermost block 10 and it will be observed that a layer of mortar is normally provided at such location, the insert projecting into the layer of mortar. From the foregoing it will be apparent that parts of a multi part insert may be moved to a first position for transport wherein the insert 16 as a whole is substantially coextensive with elide walls 12,12 of a block 10. After the inserts have been installed in the blocks at the block plant and transported to the job site in a conventional manner, the insert parts may be moved in a relative sliding movement as illustrated in Fig, 8 with the inserts in stacked relationship whereby to provide for the movement of the parts to their second positions and the overlapping and interlocking relationship thereof. Returning to Fig. 1, and referring also to Figs. 5, 6, and 7, both the improved masonry block and the insulating insert of the present invention have overlap and interlock means along each end marginal portion thereof so as to provide for horizontal overlapping and interlocking relationship between each wall and insert and horizontally contiguous block walls and inserts thereabout in z structural wall or the like formed of similar blocks and inserts. Referring first to the block side walls 12,12 inFig. 1, reduced thickness narrow marginal flanges extend along each end edge portion of each wall with a protecting righthand flange 26 at the xighthand end of each side wall.At a lefthand end of each side wall a similar flange 28 is provided and at the top of each wall a flange 30 is provided. At the bottom of each ride wall a flat surface is provided and this minates the necessity for removable bars or mold parts and an expensive special molding technique. Accordingly, with the flat bottom surfaces of the side walls 12,12 standard molding procedures and standard mold construction may be employed in the manufacture of the blocks 10,10, As will be seen the righthand end flanges 26,26 extend in a plane parallel with the outer surfaces of the aide walls 12,12 and are of reduced thickness as mentioned.The opposite end or lefthand flanges 28,28 and the upwardly projecting flanges 30,30 also extend in a common plane and are coplanar with the inner surfaces of the walls 12,12. Thus end flanges 26a,26a in a block lOa in Fig. 5 overlap and interlock with flanges 28,28 on a block 10 in Fig 5. In Fig. 6 the blocks 10 and lOa have their top flanges 30,30a in engagement with the flat bottom surfaces of B block lOb and a mortar receiving groove 32 is thus defined between the blocks and extends horizontally in a uniform manner,The end flanges on the blocks 10,10 also define a uniform mortar receiving groove which extends vertically at 34 between the said blocks. As will be apparent blocks such as 10, lOa, lOb may be assembled and stacked in vertical relationship and in horizontal rows to construct a conventional masonry wall as in rigs. 7 and 9, Each block has overlapping and interlocking engagement along each end marginal portion thereof with horizontally adjacent blocks. Uniform masonry grooves are defined as at 32,34 and inaccuracies in construction are thus avoided The insulating inserts 18,18 employed in the blocks enjoy quadri lateral overlapping and interloçking engagement with all adjacent inserts thereabout with a righthand flange 36 interengaging with a lefthand flange 38. That is, referring to Figs.1, 2, and S, it will be observed that the parts 18a,18b of the inserts 16,18 may be offset horizontally slightly so as to effectively define flanges 36,38. The flanges interengage and overlap as best illustrated in Fig. 5 and, combined with the vertical overlapping and interlocking of Fig. 8, quadri lateral overlapping and interlocking relationship is provided for. Thus, there is no lateral path for heat transfer through the inserts at the mortar joints or in fact at any point or area except through the notches in the inserts where the arms 14,14 reside.With crosssectional area of the arms reduced to no more than 10 of the total face area of the improved building block, it is believed that U Values in the range 0.05 to 0.10 BTU FTZHRF can be achieved. Further, the lateral transmission or migration of moisture is minimized if not eliminated with the overlapping and interlocking arrangement of the inserts 18,18. Moreover a bevelled or tapered edge can be provided externally at one of the end flanges of an insert to provide for a vertical path for moisture to flow downwardly adjacent a side wall of a building block and this will further inhibit the transmission or migration of moisture into the core area of the blocks.Such a bevelled or tapered area can also be usca to physically seal interlocking blocks with a moisture proofing material. The density of the insert can also be made higher in the area where the insert fits into the notch portion of the arms.This can be done by making the fit of the insert sufficiently tight as to cause a squeezing action on the insert or a higher density may be provided by physically molding inserts to a higher density prior to insertion in the blocks. The structural ass is trance thus given the blocks by the inserts can be substantially enhanced. It is also possible to provide a slightly bowed insert construction so that the inserts will be in tight frictional engagement and forced securely against the inner surfaces of the side walls of the blocks. This will tend to further enhance the prevention of moisture migration as well as the passage of heat, sound and even air into the inner core of the blocks. Referring particularly to Fig. 3, it will be observed that a small stand off element 44 may be provided and may be of a material suitable for nailing and or receiving and securely holding screw type or other connectors. The stand off elements can be employed in eliminating the expensive studding or other construction normally used in applying an overlay or finish surface. As will be apparent in Fig. 3, the stand off elements may comprise small plastic members having T shaped end portions and a body portion which extends through a small laterally extending notch 46 in the end flanges of building blocks. Referring now to Figs. 10 et sequa, a presently preferred form of g multi part Insert 18 is illustrated together with a presently preferred manufacturing method. Frangible means are provided for interconnecting and interengaging the parts of the multi part insert and the insert is held in its aforemen tioned first position by such means but the means are readily ruptured manually in slidably moving the insert parts to the second position mentioned above. Referring particularly to Fig.10, an insert part 18c is provided with at least one small Open ing and preferably with four equally spaced small openings 4B,4ss. As best illustrated in Fig, 12, the openings 48 extend partially through the insert and are relatively small in size. In Fig. 15 et sequa, small lugs 50,50 are provided on an insert part 18d and are adapted to enter and substantially fit the openings 48,48 on the part 18c Four such lugs are provided and when the insert is made of a light weight fragile material as for example expanded polystyrene, the lugs may be readily broken off or sheared in relative movement of the insert parts. Thus, referring to Fig.21, it will be observed that lugs 50,50 are entered in the small openings 48,48 and the insert parts 18c and 18d are thus held in their first position. That is, the parts are held in alignment so as to reside wholly within the outline of the side walls of a block when inserted in a block. In Fig. 22, the portion 18d of the insert 16 has been moved downwardly as in Fig. 4, 8 above, and the small lugs 50,50 have been ruptured or broken off in the course of such movement. As will be apparent, the use of the lug SO, opening 48 arrangement, particularly with a tight frictional fit, serves to retain the insert parts 18c, 18d in the assembled first position of Fig. 22. Thus, the handling and the insertion of the inserts into the building block at the block manufacturing plant is facilitated. The frangible nature of the lugs 50,50, provides for a ready movement of the parts in a sliding operation with slight downward manual pressure during the construction of a wall or the like as in Figs. 4 and 8. In Fig. 20, a pair of the insert parts 18did are shown manufactured in a single mold, with the lugs 50,50 oriented in opporite directions. As will be apparent, considerable economy in molding can be achieved in such a molding technique. Once the two parts lBd,18d have been molded in a single mold cavity, a hot wire or other cutting device 54 may be used to separate the parts 18did along a plane intermediate the opposing surfaces thereof. Small arrow 56 indicates the direction of relative movement of a hot wire 54 in such operation, As will be apparent from the foregoing, the improved building block and insulating insert of the present invention provide for minimum lateral heat transfer and a substantial im movement in U Value. Moisture migration through the wall is minimized if not eliminated and even sound and air transmission charaterietics are substantially improved. The building block may be manufactured with conventional mold structures and molding techniques and substantial economies are thus achieved. Finally, inaccuracies introduced by non uniform mortar joints as with conventional blocks are eliminated. Thus, the present building blocks exhibit uniform mortar joints throughout by reason of the aforementioned uniform mortar groove formed by the side wall flanges on the blocks.
