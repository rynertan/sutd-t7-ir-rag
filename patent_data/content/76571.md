# Improved infrared gas analyzer having detector elements of differing types.

## Abstract
A nondispersive infrared gas analyzer having at least one pneumatic or Luft type detector 40 and at least one black body type detector 60,70 located one behind the other along the optical axis of the analyzer. In the preferred embodiment, a black body detector 60,70 is exposed to radiation from a sample cell 20 through an intervening pneumatic detector 40 . The pneumatic detector 40 absorbs radiation at specific infrared wavelengths, while the black body detector 60,70 absorbs radiation substantially uniformly at all wavelengths. Signals from the pneumatic detector 40,50 and the black body detector 60,70 are combined electronically in an improved signal processing circuit 80,90,100 to provide an output signal 120 that is substantially free of the effects of disturbing influences such as infrared source intensity variations, mechanical vibrations and shock, and presence of interfering compounds.
