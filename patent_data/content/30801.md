# Ferrocene catalyzed elastomer formation.

## Abstract
Oxygen curable compositions are prepared by mixing mercaptoorganopolysiloxanes, aliphatically unsaturated polydiorganosiloxanes and a dicyclopentadienyl iron com pound. Suitable dicyclopentadienyl iron compounds include ferrocene and various ferrocene derivatives.
