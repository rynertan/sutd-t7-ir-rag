# Resistivity surveying apparatus.

## Abstract
A resistivity surveying apparatus comprises a base station 9 and 30 reels RL1 to RL30 . The base station 9 comprises a computer 10 and a resistivity meter 11 having four output terminals. Each reel has a multi line cable CB1 to CB30 which includes four resistivity measuring lines for connection to the output terminals of meter 11 and further lines for connection to the output terminals of computer 10 . An electrode EL1 to EL30 which may be driven into the ground is mounted on each reel. In the hub of each reel RL1 to RL30 , there is provided a circuit CKT1 to CKT30 for connecting the electrode EL1 to EL30 to one of the resistivity measuring lines under the control of the computer 10 . In operation, the electrodes are driven into the ground at spaced intervals. The free end of one CB1 of the cables is connected to the base station 9 and the remaining cables are connected in series. The computer 10 then drives the apparatus through a measurement sequence. For each measurement, four electrodes are selected and connected to respective ones of the resistivity measuring lines.
