# Carbamoyl sulfides, their preparation, compositions containing them, their use to control insects, intermediates therefor and preparation of said intermediates.

## Abstract
Carbamoyl sulfides of the formulae CHEM wherein R is selected from various iminooxy groups R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are independently H, halogen, nitro, CN, CF3, alkyl, alkoxy, ester or amide groups or R 1 and R 2 form a butadienyl bridge R 1 1 , R 1 2 , R 1 3 and R 1 4 are independently H, alkyl, alkoxy or halogen or either R 1 1 and R 1 2 or R 1 3 and R 1 4 form a butadienyl bridge exhibit insecticidal activity especially on Lepidoptera species. They may be formulated for use in conventional manner. The compounds can be made by reacting corresponding acyl fluorides of formulae CHEM with RH in the presence of base. The novel acyl fluorides from a further aspect of the invention. They may be made by reacting a corresponding 2 or 4 nitrosophenol with N,N min thiobis N methylcarbamic fluoride .
