# Top cover panel for a container.

## Abstract
A cover arrangement for a truck box is provided by a pair of rigid cover panels 3 which extend along the length of the truck box and meet at the centre line 14 . The cover panels are pivotally movable from the closed abutting position to an open position alongside side walls 12 of the truck box on upper and lower levers 34, 35 with the upper levers 34 interconnected by a torque tube 49 rotatably mounted on the panel 31 . The panel 31 is formed by a framework having transverse struts and longitudinal weight support tubes. The upper levers 34 , one arranged at each end of the panel 31 , are spring biased and latched into the closed position. A gable end structure which is inclined inwardly provides a flange for supporting the ends of the cover panel in a manner which provides a seal and reduces air pressure.
