# PARTICULATE FILLER AND POLYMER COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE FILLER

## Abstract
A coated particulate filler having bound thereto a material comprising an acidic group reactive with the filler and a sulphur containing group which is not reactive with the filler but which is decomposable to a sulphur containing species which is capable of taking part in a sulphur based curing reaction, a composition containing the filler and an organic polymeric material which contains ethylenic unsaturation and which is curable by reaction with sulphur, a process for pro ducing the coated particulate filler, and a process for produc ing the composition.
