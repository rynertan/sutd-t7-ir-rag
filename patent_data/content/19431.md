# A METHOD FOR RECOVERING VANADIUM FROM PETROLEUM COKE

## Abstract
To provide an economical method for the recovery of vanadium from petroleum coke containing inorganic compounds including vanadium, the coke is gasified with steam in the presence of an alkali metal salt gasification catalyst, such as potassium or sodium carbonate, to produce a combustible gas and an inorganic ash composed primarily of said inorganic compounds and a water soluble alkali metal vanadate. Preferred temperatures for the gasification are 535 C to 1100 C. The inorganic ash is placed in a sufficient amount of water to leach out the vanadate compound. The vanadium is then recovered. If the content of other water soluble material in the ash is low say below about 25 of the total water soluble material , the vanadate is recovered directly from the leached solution, e.g., by precipitation. If that content is high, then an extraction with an organic solution of a known vanadium extracting agent, such as a tertiary amine, is used.
