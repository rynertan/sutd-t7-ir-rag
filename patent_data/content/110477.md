# Clock controlled filtering arrangement.

## Abstract
A clock controlled filtering arrangement for suppress ing a number of interference frequencies related to a clock frequency, which comprises a time discrete comb filter in cluded in a negative feedback loop for a selective negative feedback of the said interference frequencies, which time discrete comb filter is connected to an output of a clock gen erator for controlling the frequency location of the pass ranges of the comb filter. In order to avoid on the one hand the introduction of quantizing noise and the use of additio nal circuits, such as A D and D A converters, and on the other hand the occurrence of error cumulation whilst main taining an adequate interference suppression, the time discrete comb filter is of the switched capacitor N path filter type.
