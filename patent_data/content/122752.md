# Digital video tape recorder apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for regenerating a clock pulse signal from a stream of data derived from a variable speed digital video tape recorder 20 and lacking a strong clock pulse compo nent, comprises a first phase locked loop circuit 21 to which the incoming data is supplied and which includes a loop filter 34 of relatively wide bandwidth and a first voltage controlled oscillator 35 . The first voltage controlled oscillator 35 sup plies a regenerated clock pulse signal to a second phase locked loop circuit 22 which includes a loop filter 38 of relatively narrow bandwidth and a second voltage controlled oscillator 39 which supplies a regenerated output clock pulse signal. The first and second voltage controlled oscil lators 35, 39 are controlled by a preset control signal derived by a preset control signal generator arrangement 23 in dependence on the direction and speed of a magnetic tape 10 from which the video tape recorder 20 is reproducing the stream of data.
