# Video rear screen projection apparatus.

## Abstract
A video projection apparatus comprising a housing accommodating a fixedly arranged cathode ray tube unit which has a projection lens and is secured to a frame which, adjacent two opposite side walls of the housing, has two lugs in which a shaft coupled to a motor is journalled at its ends. The shaft carries a plate at each of its ends. The apparatus comprises a first mirror which extends in the direction of width of the housing and is pivotally connected at two oppo site sides to the two side walls of the housing, this first mirror being pivotally linked by a bar, at each of said two sides to an associated one of said plates so that in one position of these plates the mirror is located entirely inside the housing and in another position it is extended with its reflecting surface fac ing the projection lens. The apparatus further comprises a transparent screen which extends in the direction of width of the housing and is provided at each of two opposite sides with a pair of pivots which are located a certain distance above one another and which are connected by first and second bars which cross one another to a pivot on the frame and a pivot on an associated one of said plates, respectively, each of the first bars being provided between its ends with a pivot which is connected via a third bar to the associated one of said plates, and a second mirror being supported between the second bars in such a manner that upon rotation of said plates the screen and the two mirrors are extended so that the rays from the cathode ray tube stride the transparent screen, while in the folded condition the said components are all located inside the housing.
