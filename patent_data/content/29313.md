# Thermal printing device.

## Abstract
A thermal printing device is disclosed which prints on or dinary paper using an ink which melts when heated but is solid at room temperature. The device comprises an ink carrier with an even outer surface which rotates to carry an ink layer formed on said sur face from an ink source to a printing position. A cylindrical rol ler with an uneven surface in directions parallel to the axis of the roller is in contact with the ink carrier along spaced lines ly ing in planes normal to the axis of the roller with the ink source between the ink carrier and the cylindrical roller. The ink of ink source is melted and adheres to the surface of the ink carrier in an ink layer as the ink carrier rotates. Means are provided at the printing position for generating thermal patterns to re melt the solid ink layer by generating thermal patterns in accord ance with printing signals. Printing paper is fed to the printing position where the paper is forced into contact with the ink carrier so that ink patterns are transcribed onto the print ing paper.
