# STERILIZATION OF PACKAGING MATERIALS

## Abstract
A method for sterilizing packaging material, the packag ing material being employed subsequent to its sterilization for the aseptic packaging of foodstuffs. The method includes the steps of 1 first subjecting the packaging material to ultrason ic vibrations through a liquid medium, and 2 then subjecting the packaging material to ultraviolet radiation. The bactericidal effect of steps 1 and 2 combined together as a sequence in the order recited is greater than if practiced in the reverse or der. The process of this invention can be applied to a moving web of packaging material. The moving web, after its steriliza tion treatment, can be fed through known machinery for form ing, filling, and sealing of aseptic packages for foodstuffs.
