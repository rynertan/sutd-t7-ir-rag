# Variable displacement compressor.

## Abstract
In a refrigerant compressor whose displacement is controlled by crankcase suction pressure differential, a con trol valve arrangement 130 is responsive to both compressor suction and discharge pressures 114 and 124 to provide controlled communication of these pressures with the compressor crankcase 129 so that the compressor displace ment and thereby the discharge flow rate is caused to increase with increasing discharge pressure as well as with increasing suction pressure.
