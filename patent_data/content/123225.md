## Description
CO pOSITE STRUCTURE MACHINE X5D METHOD nackcrround of The Invention This invention relates to composite reinforced polymeric or plastic structures and, more particularly, to such structures utilizing a resin having reinforcements selectively placed therein. Composite components utilizing a tilerrosetting resin having reinforcements therein are nowt and have been widely used in the art. These components find particular utility in the automotive industry because of their light weight and highstrength structural characteristics. The composite structures generally comprise a thermosetting resin with reinforcements of glass fibers or glass filaments and the like. The reinòrce menus may take the form of a chopped glass fiber or continuous glass filaments or a bundle of filaments forming a so called roving, or the like.The reinforcements may also take the form of a woven cloth, a tape which is pre impregnated with a partially or semi cured flowable therrosetting resin, a fiber rat or sheet molding compound sic , or the like. The resins commonly used are polyester, vinylester, epoxy and polymides. These members are then placed together to form a specific composite matrix structure utilizing the resin to hold the reinforcement materials in selected positions within the matrix. In the prior art, however, the need for specific structural properties at high stress points of the composite structure necessitated the use of the reinforcement member throughout the composite structure. As a result, the composite structures were over designed in non critical portions of the overall structure. This was due to the homogeneous nature of the reforcement materials of the prior art wherein the required geometric configuration at a high stress point dictated the characteristics of the reinforcement material at the less critical portions of the device. This problem was overcome by the use of a base layer having the required minimal structural properties in the overall device and by selectively placing localized reinforcements at anticipated critical locations of the composite device. That is, the selected reinforcerent material provided the desired physical properties for the critical areas and took the form of materials such as SMC. This technique varied the properties of the composite device by orienting layer over layer with the base layer being the minimal structural property required.From the base point the structure was built up in layers with different structural properties achieved by utilizing two or a greater number of layers disposed in many different configurations. This method has worked well and has received widespread acceptance in the art. However, this selective reinforceant technique presents several problems particularly with respect to high volume production, One of the most significant problems presented by the selective reinforcement process is that it normally requires manual operation or hand lay up and therefore requires sionifi cantly greater processing time relative to an automated process.Another problem is the high pressure that must be utilized in order to liquefy the partially or semi cured resin in reinforcement materials such as SMC. This necessitates tooling and presses of relatively higher cost. Further, due to the high pressure recuirenent, long curing times must be utilized relative to the curing tines required in low pressure processes.Since these prior art techniques normally require manual operation, or hand lav up, to position the semi cured materials into the mold cavity they therefore are significantly operatorsensitive. i40reover, it has been found that the selective place.l.ent process fails to consistently provide void free, good adhesion properties between the lawyers. Further, since one of the layers must move relative to the other layers in the mold cavity, proper placement of the reinforcement has been difficult to assure and consistent bonding of the layers has not been achieved. Another problem of the selective layer technique has been the inability to maintain proper tension on the continuous reinforcement as it is placed in the nold cavity which results in non parallel reinforcement fibers or fibers with an undesired curvature. This further results in abnormal or undesired structural properties. This undesired non parallel placement also permits resin rich areas and resin void areas due to the high pressures. that are utilized to flow the fibers and resin into their final placement positions. Further, the failure to provide proper tension adversely effects the structural strength of the finished part. These and other disadvantages are overcome by the present invention wherein there is provided a composite structural member, and a method and a machine for making same, in which the reinforcements are positioned and contained throughout the charging stage and the molding and curing stages. The compression molding is accomplished with relatively low pressures. The desired plysical properties are achieved through the control of the precise quantities and placement of each individual reinforcement at any desired point within the composite matrix. The reinforcements can be accurately controlled so as to change directions or orientation within different cross sectional areas of the composite part.While compression flowing of the resin in the matrix may occur to a limited extent, the invention does not rely upon flowing of the matrix to disperse the reinforcements. The positioning of the reinforcements is precisely controlled to coincide with the desired location once the wet charge has completely cured. summary Of The Invention Briefly, a method and a machine are provided for producing hig.h strength composite structures of thermosetting or thermoplastic resin with reinforcements therein. An initial wet charge of resin and reinforcements such as fiberglass rovings is provided as a continuous source which is pre tensioned and advanced through the machine. A plural ity of reinforcements are then placed in the tensioned charge at predetermined positions within the cross sectional area thereof. A composite matrix is thereby formed wherein continuous longitudinal rovings of predetermined location can be placed in combination with reinforcements of an angular orientation which can vary in the range of o e Doo to the length direction. A mold cavity having a given cross sectional area and extending a given length is provided and the given area may vary along the length. The composite matrix is advanced into and compression molded in the mold cavity and the composite matrix is cured while being maintained under a predetermined tension. The cured product is severed from the continuous source and erected from the machine.

Structure 10 is illustrated in the form of a curved automotive bumper member having curved end portions 11 and which is of a generally U shaped cross section as illustrated in Figure 2. The forward surface of bumper structure 10 includes a depression 12, as best illustrated in Figure 2 and 3, and further includes a tapered or varying cross section in the legs 14 of the generally U shaped cross section.As will be described more fully hereinafter, the cross section may incorporate a composite matrix of reinforcements utilizing glass, carbon, and steel fibers in combination with woven fibers, metal stampings and any other compatible reinforcement which is held in place by a resin system capable of bonding these materials into a uniform composite material composed of up to 35 reinforcement and 15 resin system by weight. In accordance with the present invention, each reinforcement is precisely placed and may comprise a fiber from the size of a filament of glass to a group of filaments comprising a roving and on through the use of woven cloth materials and the use of chopped and continuous strand mats.Further, the form of structure 10 is not limited to a constant cross sectional configuration and, in accordance with the present invention1 the cross sectional configuration advantageously can be varied at any point along the longitudinal axis of bumper structure 10. That is, while the volume of any cross sectional portion remains constant, the cross section may vary to accomodate a given structural requirement.For example, the cross section of a given structure or part mau vary from a round to a square configuration provided that the cross sectional volume remains the same. Referring now to Figure 4 there is shown a machine 100 for making high strength composite structures in accord ance with the principles of the present invention. machine 100 includes an endless source of reinforcement materials illustrated in the form of fiberglass rovings. Source 112 takes the form of a creel of fiberglass doffs provided on and in a suitable rack. In currently preferred practice, source 112 includes seven separate racks having five shelves in each rack. Each of the thirty five shelves is provided with twelve separate doffs. Accordingly, 420 separate fiberglass ravings are provided by source 112. In one constructed embodiment, the ravings were Owens Corning Fiberglass type 30, 113 yield and 225 yield. The leading ends of each of ravings 114 are received in and guided through carding plates llCa, 116b and 116c. The carding plates may take the form of a plate or disk having a plurality of apertures or through holes therein. The apertures are provided in a predetermined pattern so that the emerging ravings take on a predetermined cross sectional configuration. Two rolls of carrier stock 113a and 118b in the farm of woven cloth mats or tape of a given width are illustrated in this embodiment by way of example.The carrier stock itself is a reinforcement material which forms an element of the composite matrix and, if necessary, also functions as a belt or support for the ravings as they advance through machine 100. That is, the geometry of the ultimate part or product and therefore the cross sectional configuration of the composite matrix charge may necessitate the use of a suitable carrier stock for transporting the charge during the charge preparation. The ends of the woven cloth or tape are placed onto the adjacent rovings through or immediately after the adjacent carding plate. The rovings are then fed through resin baths 120a, 120b and 120c.The resin baths function to impregnate each group of roving and carrier stock to form a wet charge of cowrosite materials comprising wet resin and fiberglass reinforcements. In one constructed embodimpnt, the resin was Cazens CorningFiberglass type E98 2 which is a low shrink polyester resin. In currently preferred practice the roving are placed under tension after they emerge from the carding plates.This is done by routing and looping the rovings into and out from an S shaped path through a pair of spring loaded pulleys prior to the resin baths. As described more fully hereinafter, it has been found that selecting or adjusting the spring constant of the tensioning device to provide .907kg , 2 lbshf tension in each roving provides good results. Figure 4a and 4b provide cross sectional views looking into the longitudinal axis of the reinforcement materials, including woven mats W, emerging from carding plates 116a and 116c, respectively. For clarity, only a limited number of rovings R or roving bundles are shown. The impregnated rovings are then guided through rollers 122a and 122b and into a final carding plate 124 which is similar to carding plates llba c and which may include squee2e out bushinqs to accommodate the wet charge. Figure 4c is a view of the composite matrix, including wet resin r seen looking into the longitudinal axis of the charge traversing carding plate 124. Carding plate 124 may be provided in a predetermined shape and cross sectional configuration over which fibers or reinforcements are wrapped. Further, a mandrel can be used at this stage so that the charge, and the ultimate finished product, is formed of a hollow configuration. The charge at the output of carding plate 124 is then advanced through a pair of biaxial reinforcement applicators 126 and 128. Each biaxial applicator includes a rotary member coaxial With the longitudinal axis of the composite matrix charge and the rotary members are mounted for rotation in respectively opposite directions. As will be described more fully hereinafter, each applicator includes a source of reinforcements thereon and a central opening therein for receiving the composite matrix charge.As the composite matrix charge advances through applicators 126 and 122, each applicator is rotated at a given rate so Åas to wrap its reinforcements around the longitudinally extending rovings of the composite matrix, This results in an additive reinforcement pattern having an angular orientation in the length direction of the composite matrix charge which can vary in the range of 0 to 1 900 i.e., biaxially depending upon the speed of rotation of the applicators and the speed of the composite charge advancing through the applicators. By using a pair of biaxial rotary applicators, which wrap in respectively opposite directions, a symmetrical or balanced charge is provided wherein any stresses introduced into the charge by one applicator are offset and balanced out by the other. It should also be noted that the wrapping is accomplished without the use of a conventional mandrel. That is, the longitudinally extending and tensioned rovings of the composite matrix charge provide the function of a mandrel. of course, there are certain applications and products where a conventional mandrel could be used such as for a hollow structure or a tube. On the other hand, a suitable core such as a foam core also can be utilized in those applications. It should also be aporeciated that the ore sent invention can be practiced without the use of rotary applicators. That is, it is contemplated that many products will not require a charge and reinforcement pattern of the type provided by the rotary applicator. The output of applicators 126 and 128 provide a composite charge C wherein the composite matrix is setup and ready for compression molding. The charge C is then advanced into a compression molding press 130. Press 130 includes a reciprocating ram 132 which is mechanically fixed to a movable upper female die 134. A lower male die 136, which can be fixed or movable is suitably fastened to the frame of press 130. Press 130 further includes a clamping device 133 which is utilized to clamp and tension charge C when the dies are closed to compression mold and form the final part. Machine 100 further includes a clamping, cutoff and ejection station 140 which includes a clamping device 142 which is movably mounted on a stationary rack 144. Clamping device 142 includes a pair of movable clamps 142a and 142b which are adapted to clamp and hold the cured finished product once dies 134 and 136 are opened following a compression molding operation. Clamping device 142 also functions to provide proper tensioning during the molding operation. then the dies are opened, clamping device 142 is advanced over male die 136 to clamp and then remove the cured part and to sever the cured part from the balance of charge C by means of a pair of cutters 146 and 147.In one constructed embodiment a small amount of offal was provided between each cured part and the balance of the charge,As each part advanced through the machine the pair of cutters severed and removed the offal from each end of, and properly sized, the finished part. The dies 134 and 136 of press 130 include conventional heating means not shown which facilitate curing of the charge C. As will be explained more fully hereinafter, press 130and station 140 are movably mounted on a track from a first position adjacent applicator 128 to a second position spaced apart from applicator 128. This movement is provided, in part, to advance charge C when the dies are closed and the part is curing within the press. That is, when the dies are opened Dress 130 is initially moved and positioned adjacent applicator 128 and over the stationary wet charge.Once the dies close, and the curing operation begins, the press is moved away from applicator 128 so as to pull and advance a new wet charge C into position for the next molding operation. Further, while the press is moving and before the dies close, clamping device 138 closes and clamps onto chargeC under a predetermined pressure which allows charge C to slit through the clamp when the tension on charge C exceeds .907kg wo pounds. . Clamping device 142 maintains the tension on the other side of the dies. This is done to maintain the rredetermined tension on the longitudinally extending rovings in charge C during the compression molding operation.This then precisely maintains the reinforcements in their intended positions within the mold cavity. The dies are also programed to close slowly just before they meet. This is done to allow trapped air and excess resin to escape thereby assuring a void free finished part with proper resin distribution. It should also be appreciated that charge C can be provided in various cross sectional configurations and is not limited to the generally rectangular configuration illustrated in Figure 4c. For example, a plate die can be provided before or after clamping device 138 to provide an extruded type cross section which is pulled through the plate die. The shape of the plate die, and therefore the cross section of the resulting charge, can take a generallyU shaped, L shaped or any one of a number of desired con figurations. Referring now to Figures 5a and Sb there are shown elevation and side views of biaxial rotary applicator 128.It can be seen that applicator 128 includes a frame 150 which is mounted to a suitable base 152. Disposed within frame 150 is a floating drive ring 154 which is rotably mounted and driven by the rubber drive wheel 156 of a motor 158 which is in contact with the radially outer surface of drive ring 154. In currently preferred practice, drive ring 154 is provided with ten doff holders 160 equally spaced 360 apart on each side of drive ring 154 or a total of twenty doffs. Each doff holder prov des a source of reinforcement or fiberglass rovings R which are paid out from a doff and are guided radially inwardly through radially extending bore holes 162 of an inner delivers ring 164. The delivery ring includes ten transverse set screws 166 on each side of delivery ring 164 which are adjusted to provide a drag or vredetermined tension to each roving R as it is pulled and advanced through delivery ring 164 toward the wet charge extending along the axis of applicator 128. In currently preferred practice, the set screws are adjusted to provide O.907 kg of tension in each roving. It can be seen that applicator 128 is adapted for counter clockwise rotation as viewed in Figure Sa. Accordingly, each of the twenty rovings R are wound or wrapped around the roving or roving bundles of the wet charge in a counter clocklsi e direction.As illustrated in Figure Sbp applicator 128 includes a generally elliptically shapec wrap control hoop 167 on the downstream side of applicator 128. Hoop 167 functions as a run out control so that rovings R make contact with and are wrapped about the wet charge in an area relatively close to applicator 128. It should now be appreciated that applicators 126 and 128 function to wrap or wind reinforcement materials around the wet roving bundles and in a pattern determined by the speed of the advancing charge C and the rotational speed of applicators 126 and 128. Further, it should also be appreciated that the winding or wrapping is accomplished without the use of a mandrel as is used in the prior art.Again, however, a mandrel can be employed in conjunction with the present invention to facilitate certain structures such as hollow structures. Referring now to Figure 6 there is shown at 170 a dia grammatic representation of a charge of composite reinforcement materials. For clarity, only five rovings, or five roving bundles, are illustrated. Prior to the wrapping or winding operation, the roving extend along a longitudinal axis. A first reinforcement material 171 as illustrated in the form of A roving but which could comprise a woven cloth or tape.A second reinforcement material 172 is also illustrated in the form of a roving but which also could comprise a woven cloth or a reinforcement tape. Reinçorcement 171 is applied by a first applicator and the angular orientation of reinforcement material 171, with respect to the longitudinal axis of the rovings R, can vary between 0 and 900 as a function of the rotational speed of the applicator and the speed of the moving rovings R. Similarly, reinforcement 172 is applied by a second applicator and the orientation of reinforcement 172 can vary between 0 and 900 as a function of the same parameters.Figure 6 further illustrates additional reinforcement materials G which may take the form of graphite filaments or any other suitable reinforcement materials.Reinforcements G are illustrated to demonstrate the capability of the process to selectively place reinforcement material at any point in the composite matrix. For example, graphite filaments G can be provided at the location of the composite matrix illustrated in Figure 6 so as to provide additional reinforcement for the leg portions 14 of the generally U shaped bumper cross section illustrated in Figure 2. The selective placement capability also applies to the angular placement.By way of example the angularity of the windings can be varied within a given charge such that a 450 angle can be maintained for 12 then 100 for 12W and then 450 again for final 12 . This, then, functions to selectively strengthen certain areas of the product such as a bumper. Referring now to Figures 7 and 8 there is shown diagrammatic plan and top views of machine lOO of the Figure 4.Figure 9 provides a simplified timing sequence chart useful in explaining the operational steps of the machine diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 7 and 8. In the initial DOAD POSITION, line 180 in Figure 9 represents the initial rovings R which are established and set up into a completed composite matrix charge C at the output of applicator 128. The completed charge C extends into and across the press positions. At this point, press 130 is moved into itsPRESS CLOSE nosition above and below charge C in preparation for Step 1. tine 122 illustrates the operation of the machine during Step 1. It can be seen that the dies are closed over the completed charge C while clamp 138 illus traced by arrow 183 in Figure 9 maintains tension on the rovincs to compression mold and form the completed part.In Step 2, press 130 is advanced to its PRESS OPEN position during the curing time of the charge and while the press and toll are still closed. This then functions to advance charge C as illustrated in line 184 of Figure 9. The press then opens and traverses back to the PRESS CLOSE position leaving the formed charge in its new position. In Step 3, and with press 130 now in its PRESS CLOSE position, the press again closes to form the next completed part. As illustrated in line ISE of Figure 9 two cured and completed parts are nof centrally joined as at 187. In Step 4, and as illustrated by line 188, the press again moves to its open position at which time the first completed part 190 is cut and severed from the balance or upstream portion of charge C. Figure 8 illustrates an additional wrapping or winding operation which can be added to the machine in accordance with the principles of the present invention. That is,Figure 8 further illustrates a mat applicator 200 which is similar to applicators 126 and 128 previously described but is specifically adapted for the application of a wider mat material 202. Again, the rotational speed and longitudinal motion of charge C determine the angular orientation of the applied mats 202. As previously described, machine 100 further includes a controlled or programed movement to maintain 2 predetermined tension on the generally longitudinally extending rovings in the wet charge during the compression molding operation. This is particularly significant with respect to longitudinally curved or contoured workpieces. Other wise, tension on the reinforcement fibers along the shorter radii of the curved configuration would build up and increase and thereby squeeze out the surrounding resin resulting in a part having undesirable resin void and resin rich areas.In accordance with the present invention, clamping devices 138 and 142 in Figure 4 in conjunction with the controlled movement of machine 100 provide the tensioning function as follows Station 140 is mounted to press 130 for movement therewith along a track and between the PRESS OPEN andPRESS CLOSE position. Clamping device 142 is further independently mounted for movement toward and away from press 130. As the press dies are being closed over the wet charge, the press itself is moving into the PRESS CLOSE position. During this movement, clamping device 138 is closed to clamp the wet charge, which extends upstream of the dies, under a predetermined pressure. This predetermined pressure allows the wet charge, or any of the individual rovings therein, to slip toward the dies when the tension on the charge, or any of the individual rovings therein, exceeds O.907 kg Jo rounds . This controlled stoppage of one or more rovings can translate all the way back or upstream to the doffs at source 112. Thus, as the dies close, the induced tension on the reinforcements therein cannot exceed no 9O7 kg and this ensures that the proper tension and placement of the reinforcements are maintained .Simultaneously, the clamping device 142 of station 140 is closed on the wet charge which extends downstream of the dies and the relative movement of clamping device 142, with respect to the movement of press 13C and station 140 therewith, is orecisely controlled so as to maintain the predetermined tension on the reinforcements in the closing dies. Referring now to Figures 10, 11 and 12a and 12b there are shown plan, side and cross sectional views which illustrate an alternative composite structure which is made in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The structure shown takes the form of a composite spring 300 which provides the function and strength of a conventional steel leaf spring in automotive applications. The end mounting flange areas 302 are provided with an inset steel wear ring 304. Otherwise, the entire spring is made of composite materials comprising reinforcements and resin in accordance with the principles of the present invention. It can be seen that the cross sectional shape of spring 300 varies in its longitudinal direction. However, each composite section is of equal volume in all areas except the end mounting flange areas.The fiber orientation in the main body of spring 300 is 10cut longitudinal and, of course, it can be any other desired orientation. The end mounting flange areas are provided by building up the material at those locations using the rotational wrapping and winding system in accordance with certain features of the present invention. The material is wrapped around wear rings 304 which are placed in the wet charge. The fiber orientation in the end mounting flange areas is 408 45 diagonal. Spring 300 is merely illustrative of the many types of products which can be made in accordance with the present invention. Further examples are door frames, radiator supports, frame rails, seat frames, suspension components and the like.Other examPles are hollow constructions such as tubing, telephone pole arms, closed or box bumpers and the like. As previously alluded to, and in currently preferred practice, the coninression mold press preferably includes heating means to facilitate the curing process. Means are provided in the dies to heat that structure to approximately 1 500C during the curing process. The temperature is variable and is varied to neet the specific reauirements of a given resin chemistry. While a resin formulation having a suitable catalyst can be provided so as to perform the curing operation at room temperature, such resins have a so called pot lifew which is relatively short.That is, since the liquid state lifetime of the resin is relatively short, it will set up cure at room temperature in the resin bath and in a rela timely short period which typically is measured in hours or less. By utilizing a heated mold and standard resins as previously described herein, it has been found that the pot life of the resins used is on the order of several days. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the process in accordance with the present invention utilizes a relatively low pressure molding technique as compared to prior art processes such as SEZ. For examtle,in one constructed embodiment the press was 2 25 ton press which utilized a steel press weighing 2,268 kg 5,000 lbs .Comparable press tonnage for an SMC process in on the order of 20G 303 tons and such presses typically utilize a press weighingg,072 kg 20,0Q0 pounds and which is made of aluminum so as to minimize its weight. Further, in one constructed embodiment, the curing time of the process in accordance with the present invention was on the order of 1 minute 45 seconds and it is anticipated that most structures in thicknesses up to2 54 mm 1 inch can be cured in the range of 30 secs. to 3 minutes Again, in accordance with the present invention, these desirable characteristics follow from the elimination of the need for flowable serni cured resins and the elimination of the need to compress the composite materials to liquefy and flow them as is the case with an S, tC type process. In this regard, the S iC and related prior art techniques utilize a maturated composite material which is cured to the touch and placed in the mold in that state. Accordingly, the subsequent compression molding operation must liquefy the maturated materials in order to permit flowing to establish the composite matri . As is known in the art, the composite raterials utilized in an SÀ .C type process are worked in the so called C stage. While the materials in this state are deformable they are also dimensionally stable and, therefore, tremendous heat and pressure must be applied to cause the materials to flow in the subsequent conpression molding operation. A composite material or resin in the so called A stage is a set up charge which has been wetted out and is in a full liquid state. The so calleZ B stage applies to an impregnated resin wherein an internal chemical reaction has begun leading to maturation. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the composite structure process in accordance with the present invention works the composite materials between the A and B stares at the very beginning of stage 3, and the materials are then compression molded at very low pressures. Again, the need to liquefy and flow the charge of the SMC process necessitates the relatively high comPression molding pressures.Further, in a typical s tc process the charge is not the same size as the mold cavity and is placed so As to flow into other areas of the mold cavity. In contrast thereto, the charge utilized in the present invention preferably is the same size as the compression molding cavity and is nrecisely placed therein. However, the tool edges can be and often are designed to. automaticall edge trim as the tool closes. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention provides distinct advantages over prior art techniques other than SMC. For example, bumpers have been made using a tpre pregw wet compression molding technique with hand lay up of fully wetted outt layers of fiberglass. The layers are hand placed in a die and in z staggered or stepped configuration corresponding to the desired shape and cross sectional configuration of the finished part. Hiah pressure is then applied on a heated tool to cure the part. However, the hand lay up is operator sensitive and does not provide the production volumes of an automated system. It also will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that the materials utilized to carry out the method of the present invention can be both thermosetting and thermoplastic materials. Further, these materials can be combined in the sane mold to provide a given part. For exentler a base layer of thermosetting material can be bonded to a decorative layer of thermoplastic material in the mold cavity. It also has been found that the mold cavity can be suitably coated so as to provide in mold coloring of the finished workpiece. It further has been found that the mold cavity can be suitably coated to pro vi2e a superior Class A finish such as by utilizing a polvester resin or jell coating, for both color and a better finish.This is typically done in conjunction with the application of a surfacing veil dispensed at 118a and 118b in Figure 4. Finally, it is noted that the machine illustrated in Figure 4 is only one of a variety of machines which would be suitable for practicing the present invention and for producing composite structures thereunder. What has been taught, then, is a machine and method for making high strength composite structures of cured resin with reinforcements precisely placed therein. The invention facili ates,notably, the provision of a finished part which can be of a curved contour and in which the cross section can vary. The part is not limited to a constant continuous cross section. The part is compression molded using low pressure and the process does not primarily depend on compression flowing of the composite matrix. The forms of the inventions illustrated and described herein are but preferred embodiments of these teachings. They are shown as illustrations of the inventive concepts, however, rather than b way of limitation and it is pointed out that various modifications and alterations may be indulged in xrithin the scope of the appended claims.
