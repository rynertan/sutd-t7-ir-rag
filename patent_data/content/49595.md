# Production of vinyl halide polyolefin polymer.

## Abstract
Production of vinyl halide polyolefin graft copolymers by a liquid phase bulk polymerization process is carried out in the presence of a diluent. Suitable diluents preferably have vaporization pressure characteristics, within 6.89 10Â² kPa, and similar liquid state viscosity, as vinyl halide monomer. The diluents are soluble in vinyl halide monomer under the reaction conditions and are inert to the polymerization mass. The diluents are straight or branched chain or cyclic saturated hydrocarbons having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms. Particularly useful diluents are n propane, n butane, isobu tane or mixtures thereof. The diluents are utilized in amounts from 0.2 to less than 50.0 percent based upon the total weight of the reaction charge. The polymers thus produced can be used to make moulded articles.
