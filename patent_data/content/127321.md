## Description
Description Ophthalmic Devices Fabricated From Urethane Acrylates of Polysiloxane AlcoholsField of the Invention This invention relates to ophthalmic devices having high oxygen permeability and to a process for their preparation and more particularly to wettable ophthalmic devices having high oxygen permeability fabricated from monourethane acrylates of polysiloxane alcohols.Background Art The use of various ophthalmic devices, particularly those useful for application directly on the eye such as contact lenses, are known for the correction of vision difficulties. However, such devices have not been accepted by many people, in part because of the time often required by the eye to become accustomed to their use, the physiological intolerance that sometimes develops often after only short periods of use, or the inadequate visual correction which may be provided by them. Consequently, a great amount of effort has been expended in attempts to solve these problems for the contact lens wearer. These efforts have included modification in both the design of the lens and the composition of the lens material. Modifications in lens design so as to improve the fit of the lens to the eye have produced only marginal reduction of the physiological intolerance in some people.Modification of the composition of the lens material has also only been partially successful. Early contact lenses were made from polymethyl methacrylate PMMA , a hard material that is not waterabsorptive. Lenses of PMMA, although they are readily machinable and have excellent optical clarity and durability, have a high level of physiological intolerance for many individuals partly because of the stiffness of the lens and partly because the eye becomes deprived of oxygen due to the low oxygen permeability of the PMMA. Lenses of soft water absorptive hydrogel materials which bind free water, such as poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylpyrrolidone , cause less irritation but at the cost of reduced visual acuity and greatly increased maintenance of the lenses. When such hydrogel lenses are hydrated, they also have a high oxygen permeability and generally are, therefore, comfortable to wear. However, the hydrated lenses have poor durability and exhibit a tendency to become cloudy due to adsorption of proteinaceous and lipid materials. Lenses of silicone rubber are easily molded, are said to possess a softness similar to that of the upper lid of the human eye and have a high permeability to oxygen.However, contact lenses of silicone rubber may cause a burning sensation in the eye because of the low thermal conductivity of silicone rubber. Also, such lenses have been reported to sometimes tighten over the cornea in a suction cup fashion that impedes movement of the lens.This permits entrapment of toxic products and debris under the lenses and prevents tears from washiny away this debris and lubricating the eyes, thereby causing abrasion of the eye. Furthermore, silicone rubber, being lipophilic, mucophilic, and inherently non wettable, attracts debris, e.g., proteins, lipids, mucoids, and the like. Ophthalmic devices such as contact lenses have also been fabricated from polysiloxane derivatives. U.S.Patent No. 4,136,250 discloses a water insoluble hydrophilic gel suitable for contact lenses that is a copolymer of 10 to 80 percent polyolefinic polysiloxane monomers and 90 to 20 percent hydrophilic monomers. The polyolefinic polysiloxane monomers are prepared, in one embodiment, by reaction of a polysiloxane polyol with a diisocyanate followed by reaction with a hydroxyalkyl acrylate. By such means, polyolefinic polysiloxane monomers are obtained which have in each ethylenicallyunsaturated group two urethane groups. U.S. Patent No. 4,277,595 teaches shaped articles including contact lenses that are fabricated from a copolymer of acrylic acid and poly organosiloxane terminated by an activated unsaturated group, such as methacryloxy, acryloxy, or acrylamido. However, this reference also discloses that polysiloxanes having diurethane linkages, i.e.,EMI3.1 are undesirable for use in medical devices, particularly contact lenses see col. 2, lines 57 67 . It is implied that such a diurethane linkage imparts hydrolytic instability to the lens, i.e., it is degraded by water. Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,259,467, which discloses contact lenses made from polymers of polysiloxane having pendent hydrophilic groups, e.g. polyoxyalkylene, amido, and the like, states in col. 2, lines 39 47, that a polysiloxane incorporating a monourethane linkage, i.e.,EMI3.2 is likewise undesirable for use in medical devices, particularly contact lenses. U.S. Patent No. 3,808,178 discloses hard contact lenses that are prepared from a copolymer of a low molecular weight polysiloxanylalkyl methacrylate and an alkyl acrylate that can be made wettable to some degree by the incorporation of 0.1 to 10 percent by weight of one or more hydrophilic monomers. Such contact lenses have low oxygen permeability. U.S. Patent No. 4,261,875 teaches hydrophilic contact lenses made from polymers of a polysiloxane having a plurality of pendent hydroxyalkyl groups and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group. Disclosure of the Invention It has been found that shaped articles, particularly ophthalmic devices, can be fabricated from oxygen transmissive, wettable, hydrolytically stable, polysiloxane copolymers of poly organosiloxane monomers having monourethane acrylate groups and copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The devices can be prepared by direct casting into suitably shaped molds or by machining of lens blanks. Such devices are particularly suitable as contact lenses since they are hydrolytically stable and resist adsorption of tear components. This is a surprising result in view of the above mentioned prior art which teaches that polysiloxanes having urethane linkages are undesirable for medical devices, particularly contact lenses. The shaped articles of the present invention comprise polymers of an addition polymerizable monomer composition comprising by weight a. 15 to 100 percent by weight of at least one organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate monomer selected from compounds having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein each R is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a polyalkoxyl alkyl group having 1 to 3 alkoxy groups in which each alkyl group has 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or R1 wherein R1 is an acryl or methacryloyloxyalkyl carbamoyloxyalkyl group having the formula,EMI5.1 in which R2 is hydrogen or a methyl group, c is an integer of 2 to 6, and d is an integer of 1 to 12 a is zero, one, or two, but preferably is two b is a number having an average value from 2 to 100 such that when considered with the value of la provides a molecular weight to the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate of between 500 and 20,000 provided that at least 75 percent of all R groups are methyl and at least one of the R groups is an R1 group, preferably two of the R groups are terminal R1 groups, and no more than 25 percent of the R groups are R1 groups and b. 85 to n percent by weight of one or more ethylenically unsaturated comonomers copolymerizable with the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate. Ethylenically unsaturated comonomers can improve the wettability as well as control certain physical properties of the lens polymer, such as hardness, softness, and toughness. Comonomers useful in the present invention include hydrophilic group containing monomers, monomers having only one ethylenically unsaturated group, and monomers having more than one ethylenically unsaturated group, referred to as first , second , and third polymerizable monomers, respectively, and described below. Preferably, the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylates have the formulaEMI6.1 Formula II in which R2, c, and d are as defined above, and n is a number having an average value from 15 to 50. Preferably, the shaped articles of the invention comprise copolymers of compositions containing 25 to 90 percent of said organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate monomer and 75 to 10 percent of said copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer. More preferably, the shaped articles are ophthalmic devices, such as contact lenses, and comprise copolymers prepared from a monomer composition of a 30 to 80 percent, and most preferably 35 to 60 percent, by weight of said organo polysioxane urethane acrylate, b O to 60 percent, preferably 2 to 20, and most preferably 5 to 20, percent by weight of a first ethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable monomer having a hydrophilic group, and c O to 70 percent, preferably 35 to 68 percent, by weight of ethylenically unsaturated, non hydrophilic group containing, copolymerizable monomers selected from 1 a second copolymerizable monomer having one ethylenically unsaturated group, and 2 a third copolymerizable monomer having more than one ethylenically unsaturated group. As used in the present application acrylate means an acrylate or methacrylate group organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate means an organopolysiloxane substituted by one or more acryl or methacryloyloxyalkylcarbamoyloxyalkyl groups polysiloxane alcohol includes both polysiloxane monools and polysiloxane polyols that are polysiloxane compounds having at least one hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon atom of an alkyl chain that is bonded to a silicon atom oxygen permeable means having a capability to permit the passage of oxygen at least to the extent of 5Barrers when measured in accordance with the polarographic oxygen electrode method described by M. F. Refojo et al, Permeability of Dissolved Oxygen Through ContactLenses 1. Cellulose Acetate Butyrate , Cont. IntraocularLens Med.J. 3 4 , 27 1977 wettable or wettability relates to the spreading of a liquid on a surface and means an ophthalmic device having a water contact angle below 60 hydrolytically stable means not degraded by contact with water for prolonyed periods of time and hydrophilic monomer means one that enables a surface to be wettable by an aqueous solution.Detailed Description The shaped articles of the present invention exhibit an oxygen permeability of at least 5 Barrers.Preferably the devices of the invention exhibit an oxygen permeability of at least 10 Barrers, and most preferably an oxygen permeability of at least 15 Barrers. Organopolysiloxane urethane acrylates useful in the invention can be prepared by the reaction of isocyanatoalkyl acrylates or methacrylates with an organopolysiloxane that has pendent, preferably terminal, hydroxyalkyl groups.Organopolysiloxanes having pendent hydroxyalkyl groups that are suitable for use in the urethane acrylates are known and are described, for example, in the beforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,261,875. Organopolysiloxanes having terminal hydroxyalkyl groups are prepared by the platinum catalyzed reaction of a silicon hydride terminated polysiloxane with an hydroxy group protected ta alkenyl alcohol forming an organopolysiloxane having protected terminal hydroxy groups that on removal yield the desired organopolysiloxane having terminal hydroxyalkyl groups.The preparation of such organopolysiloxane urethane acrylates is illustrated by the following equations for the preparation of poly dimethyl siloxane a, bis urethane methacrylate EMI8.1 tb SEP CH3 SEP CH3 SEP Pt tb SEP H SiotnSi H SEP 2H2C CH CH20Si CH3 3 tb SEP I SEP fl1 tb SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb SEP III tb SEP jH3 SEP CH3 SEP H20 tb H3C 3SiO CH2 CH2 CH2 SEP Sio SEP Si CH2 CH2 CH2 oSi CH3 3 SEP tb SEP CH3 SEP nCH3 tb SEP IV tb SEP G13 SEP o tb SEP I SEP CfS SEP 2H2 SEP I SEP II tb SEP CIH3 SEP CIH3 SEP 2H2C C n CH2 SEP t SEP NCO tb SEP Hs CH2 2CH2 SEP siosi im2 SEP CH2 H2 tb SEP I SEP isocyanatoetryl SEP methacrylate tb SEP V tb SEP CH3 SEP 011 SEP 0 SEP j SEP r SEP 0 SEP O SEP SOCH3 tb SEP It SEP 1.1 SEP II SEP II SEP I tb SEP HZ C X SEP CH2 2NHoOtCH2t3 SEP SiaSi CH2t3CCNH CH2 2OC C CIIZ ZNCCCH2L SEP SifCH23 tb SEP ain tb SEP bisturethane SEP rnethacrylate tb SEP VI tb wherein n has an average value from 15 to 50. The polysiloxanes of the present invention which have at least one urthane acrylate group and have the formula EMI9.1 can be prepared by a process comprising the steps of a. reacting an organopolysiloxane polyol having the formulaEMI9.2 wherein each B3 is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group, a polyalkoxyl alkyl group having 1 to 3 alkoxy groups in which each alkyl group has 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or R4 wherein R4 is HO CH2 d a is zero, one, or two, but preferably is two h is a number having an average value from 2 to 100 such that when considered with the value of a provides a molecular weight to the organopolysiloxane polyol of between 500 and 20,000 and d is an integer of 1 to 12s provided that at least 75 percent of all R3 groups are methyl and at least one of the R3 groups is an R4 group, preferably two of the R3 groups are terminal R4 groups, and no more than 25 percent of the R3 groups are R4 groups with an amount of acryl or methacryloyloxyalkyl isocyanate compound sufficient to completely esterify at least one, preferably two, hydroxyl groups present, said compound having the formulaEMI10.1 wherein R2 is hydrogen or a methyl group and c is an integer of 2 to 6 h. cooling the resulting organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate for a time and at a temperature e.g., at OOC and for 1 to 5 days sufficient to precipitate insoluble material, and c. recovering the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate free of precipitated material. A variety of comonomers are useful for copolymerization with the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate. Such comonomers are characterized by having polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated groups and can impart specific properties to the resulting copolymer.Wettability is a very desirable characteristic for ophthalmic devices such as contact lenses in order to provide comfort and good visual acuity. Wettability can be improved i.e., water contact angle brought to below about 600 in a number of ways. For example, the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate can be polymerized with from about 0.01 to 60 parts by weight of the total weight of the polymerization mixture of a copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer designated first copolymerizable monomer , that has a hydrophilic group such as, for example, a hydroxy, carboxy, carbonamido, sulfonyl, or a sulfonamido group.Representative examples of useful first copolymerizable monomers include 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and methacrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate, 5 hydroxypentyl acrylate, 2,3 dihydroxypropyl acrylate and methacrylate,N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone, 2 carboxyethyl acrylate, 2 carbonamidoethyl methacrylate, 2 sulfoethyl methacrylate, 2 sulfonamidoethyl acrylate, vinylsulfonic acid, and mixtures thereof. Another technique for improving the wettability of the devices of the invention involves subjecting the surface of the device to the action of a glow discharge at a low pressure e.g. 0.05 to 5 Torr for from about 5 to 60 seconds in accordance with the disclosure in U.S. Patent No.3,940,207. As to useful comonomers having only one ethylenically unsaturated group, and no hydrophilic group, designated second copplymerizable monomers , representative examples include methyl and ethyl acrylate, methyl and ethyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, methyl 2 chloroacrylate, 2 ethoxyethyl methacrylate, 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl methacrylate, 2 cyanoethyl methacrylate, 2 N methylcarbamoyloxy ethyl acrylate and methacrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, styrene, methylstyrene, t butylstyrene, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, vinyl silanes and vinyl siloxanes, e.g., methacryloyloxypropyl tris trimethylsiloxy silane and methacryloyloxymethylpentamethyldisiloxane, and mixtures of two or more of these materials.Particularly preferred comonomers include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, and t butylstyrene. Second copolymerizable monomers contribute stiffness and physical strength to the resulting copolymers. A variety of other ingredients may be included in the polymerization mixture so as to either enhance or provide specific properties. For example, the dimensional stability of the devices of the invention may be enhanced by including in the polymerization mixture from about 0.5 to 25 parts by weight of a third polymerizable monomer , i.e., a monomer having more than one ethylenically unsaturated group and no hydrophilic group, per 100 parts by weight of a polymerization mixture.Representative examples of useful third polymerizable monomers include ethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, diethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, allyl methacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, divinyl benzene, diallyl phthalate, and the polyacrylate and polymethacrylate esters of isocyanuric acid and s triazine e.g., tris 2 acryloyloxyethyl isocyanurate available as SR9 368 from Sartomer Co., West Chester, PAY and 1,3,5 tri 2 methacryloxyethyl s triazine. The polymerization of the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate compositions may be carried out by employing initiators which generate free radicals on application of activating energy as is conventionally used in the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Included among free radical initiators are the conventional thermally activated initiators such as organic peroxides and organic hydroperoxides. Representative examples of initiators include benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl perbenzoate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, cumene hydroperoxide, azobis isobutyronitrile , and the like. Generally, from about 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of thermal initiator is used. Photoinitiators may also be employed to initiate polymerization. Such initiators are well known and have been described, for example, in polymerization art, e.g.,Chapter II of WPhotochemistry by Calvert and Pitts, JohnWiley Sons 1966 . The preferred initiators are photoinitiators which facilitate polymerization when the composition is irradiated Representative examples of such initiators include acyloin and derivatives thereof, such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ethet, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether and a tethyl benzoint diketones such as benzyl and diacetyl, etc, ketones such as acetophenone, alpha , alpha , alpha , trichloroacetophenone, 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 1 phenyl 1 propanone, o nitro alpha , alpha , alpha tri bromoacetophenone, benzophenone and p,p tetramethyldiamino benzophenone alpha acyloxime esters such as benzyl O ethoxy carbonyl alpha monoxime ketone amine combinations such as benzophenone N methyldiethanolamine, benzophenone tributylamine and benzophenone Michler s ketone7 arid ketals such as 2,2 dimethoxyacetophenone, 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone DEAP , benzil dimethylketal, benzil diethylketal and 2,5 dichlorobenzil dimethylketal, normally the photoinitiator is used in amounts ranging for about 0.01 to 5 percent by weight of the total oligomeric composition. When the quantity is less than 0.01 percent by weight, the photopolymerization rate becomes extremely low, If the photoinitiator is used in excess of 5 percent by weight no correspondingly improved effect is observed. Preferably, about 0.05 to 1.0 percent of photoinitiator is used in the polymerizable compositions. Polymerization may be carried out in bulk in a conventional manner. When the activating energy is ultraviolet light, the irradiation is typically carried out at a temperature of about 0 to 50 C for 0.5 to 5 hours or more. Following ultraviolet irradiation, the composition may be heated at 500 to 100 C to complete the polymerization When the activating energy is only heat, polymerization is usually carried out at a temperature trom about 400 to 1400C for about 1 to 50 hours. The polymerization can also he carried out in stages. For example the composition may be heated at 40 to 600C for about 1 to 25 hours, and then the temperature raised to 50 to 100 C for 5 to 25 hours.It is to be understood, of course, that the polymerization conditions are not limited to such temperature and time conditions nor to the use of ultraviolet radiation or heat as the initiating energy. The shaped articles of the invention may be provided by supplying a mold of the desired configuration, charging the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate composition thereto, and causing polymerization to take place therein by, for example, one of the techniques previously described. Devices having the desired final configuration may be obtained in this manner. The resultant device may be machined and or polished if desired using techniques known to the art. Alternatively, the devices of the invention may be provided by polymerizing the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate composition into a rod, block, or sheet followed by cutting the device therefrom. This technique is useful when the polymerization product contains at least about 30 weight percent of a compatible ethylenically unsaturated comonomer copolymerizable with the organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate. The present invention is further described in the following representative examples. All temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade and all parts are given in parts by weight unless otherwise stated. The particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be constured to unduly limit this invention. submerged Wetting Angle of polymers prepared is measured in accordance with the CLMAIndustry accepted reference procedure for determining wetting angle, adopted February 1981 Contact LensManufacturers Assoc., 435 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60611. Organopolysiloxane urethane acrylates designated PSUA A, PSUA B , etc. were prepared as followst Preparation of PSUA A 1 Preparation of poly dimethylwsiloxane having terminal silicon hydride groups. A mixture of 122.4 g octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane 13.4 g tetramethyldisiloxane, 0.7 g activated charcoal powder, and 0.07 g conc. sulfuric acid was agitated and heated at 650C for 24 hours. The mixture was then filtered and the filtrate subjected to a reduced pressure of about 0.2 Torr while heating at 700C for 48 hours, on a rotary evaporator. The resulting colorless liquid was a linear poly dimethylsiloxane that had a number average molecular weight of about 1650 and terminal silicon hydride groups as determined by NMR spectroscopy. 2 Preparation of organopolysiloxane having terminal hydroxyalkyl groups. Into a suitable reaction vessel equipped with stirrer, thermometer and apparatus for maintaining an inert atmosphere was placed 142 g 0.086 moles of the above prepared silicon hydride terminated poly dimethylsiloxane , 26.6 g 0.2 moles of allyloxytrimethylsilane, and 130 ml of toluene. The mixture was stirred under dry nitrogen and an oil bath at 600C placed about the vessel. When the temperature of the contents of the vessel reached 40DC, there was added 2 drops of a solution in divinyltetramethyldisiloxane of a platinum complex, the solution containing 26 percent by weight of platinum the catalyst solution was prepared in accordance with Example 1 of U.S.Patent No. 3,775,452 . An exothermic reaction occured raising the temperature of the mixture to over 800 C. The temperature then slowly dropped to 600C where it was held for an additional two hours. Volatile material was then removed from the reaction mixture by vacuum distillation leaving as residue the poly dimethylsiloxane having terminal trimethylsiloxypropyl groups of Formula IV. A mixture of 149 g of the above prepared poly dimethylsiloxane having terminal trimethylsiloxypropyl groups, 300 ml of tettahydrofurah, and 300 mi of 0.1 k HCl was stirred vigorously at about 25 C for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was exttacted with diethyl ether. After temoval of volatile material by vacuum distillation, a residue of poly dimethylsiloxane having terminal hydroxypropyl groups having Formula V was obtained. 3 Preparation of organopolysiloxane having terminal urethane acrylate groups. A mixture of 138 g of the above prepared poly dimethylsiloxane hating terminal hydroxypropyl groups, 25.3 g of 2 isocyanatoethyl methacrylate IEM and 10 drops of stannous octoate was stirred under nitrogen and heated at 60 C for 24 hours buring the reaction period, the presence of the isocyanate group as indicated by a 2260 cm 1 peak was monitored hy infrared spectroscopy. On observing disappearance of the isocyanate peak, about one gram increments of IEM were added until the isocyanate peak persisted, whereon 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 0.1 ml of water were added and the mixture stirred for an additional hour. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the absence of the isocyahate group.The reaction mixture was then decolorized by adding 150 ml of hexane and 1.5 g of decolorizing carbon and stirring for five or more hours Oh filtration and vacuum distillation of volatiles, linear poly dimethyl siloxane having terminal 3 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl carbamoyloxy propyl groups was obtained. This compound was stored at 0 C for about 3 days. Unexpectedly a solid material precipated from the cooled liquid residue and it was separated by filtration and identified as N,N ,2 tris methacryloyloxyethyl imidocarbonic diamide. The filtrate was termed PSUA A. tt had the structure shown by Formula VI in which had a value of about 22. Preparation of PSUA B, PSUA C, AND PSUA D The procedure for the preparation of PSUA A was repeated using 235 g instead of 122.4 g of octamethylcyclo tetrasiloxane. There was obtained a linear poly dimethyl siloxane having terminal 3 2 methacryloyloxy ethylcarbam oyloxy propyl groups. It had a structure as shown byFormula VI in which n had a value of about 35 and was termedPSUA B. By adjusting the amounts of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, linear poly dimethylsiloxane compounds having terminal 3 2 methacryloyloxy ethylcarbamoyloxy propyl groups were obtained in which n had an average value of 16 and 29 that were termed PSUA C and PSUA D, respectively.EXAMPLE I A mixture of 38 parts of PSUA A, 47 parts of methylmethacrylate, 10 parts of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 5 parts of ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate and 0.5 parts of a photoinitiator, 2 hydroxy 2 methyl l phenyl 1 propanone Darocuree 1173, E. Merck and Co. , was freeze thaw degassed in vacuo three times to give a clear colorless solution.Into a glass vial, 13 mm in diameter was placed seven grams of this solution under a nitrogen atmosphere and the vial rotated slowly while being exposed for one hour at a distance of 18.7 cm to the radiation from a 275 W Sunlamp G.E. Model RSM . The resulting cured copolymer rod was removed from the vial and cut into wafers which were machined into optically clear colorless contact lenses.These lenses had an oxygen permeability of 15 Barrer and a submerged wetting angle of 51 degrees.EXAMPLE II A solution of 60 parts of PSUA B, 40 parts of methyl methacrylate, and 0.50 parts 0.5 percent by weight 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone DEAP was degassed in vacuo using a freeze thaw process. A portion of this solution was injected with a syringe into a 125 mm x 125 mm mold made by assembling a 300 micrometer spacer between two glass plates having a sheet of 62.5 micrometer thick film of poly ethylene terephthalate attached to the inner glass surfaces. The mold also had small channels at the top to permit loading and to allow the escape of bubbles. The filled mold was exposed for 30 minutes to the radiation of a medium pressure ultraviolet lamp. The solution polymerized to an optically clear transparent sheet which was readily removed from the mold.The copolymer sheet had an oxygen permeability of 57 Barrers, a tensile strength of 10.7 MPa 1550 psi , and a modulus of 145 MPa 21,000 psi as measured according to ASTM D 882 79.EXAMPLE III Using a solution of 50 parts of PSUA B, 50 parts of methyl methacrylate, and 0.5 parts of DEAP in the procedure of EXAMPLE II, a transparent film having an oxygen permeability of 46 Barrers, a tensile strength of 15.2 MPa 2,200 psi and a modulus of 236 MPa 34,250 psi was obtained.EXAMPLE IV This example shows the preparation and copolymerization of an organopolysiloxane urethane methacrylate having pendent hydroxypropyl groups. To 10 g of a trimethylsilyloxy end capped, linear polysiloxane having about ten dimethylsiloxane units and ten 3 hydroxypropylmethyl siloxane units, which was stirred under nitrogen and cooled to 100C, was added 2.4 g of 2 isocyanatoethyl methacrylate and 0.012 g of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for seven hours. A clear trimethylsilyloxy end capped polysiloxane having about ten dimethylsiloxane units, eight 3 hydroxypropylmethyl siloxane units and two 3 2 methacryloyloxy ethylcarbamoyloxylpropylmethyl siloxane units free from isocyanate groups was obtained. Using the procedure shown in Example II for photopolymerization, a degassed solution of 6 g of the above polysiloxane urethane methacrylate, 4 g of methyl methacrylate and 0.03 g of diethoxyacetophenone was irradiated in the glass mold for 1 hour using a medium pressure ultraviolet lamp. A clear film was obtained having an oxygen permeability of 14 Barrers, a tensile strength of 10.5 MPa 1530 psi and a modulus of 276 MPa 40,000 psi .The film had a submerged water contact angle of 700.EXAMPLE V XIII In accordance with the general procedure ofExample II, there were prepared sheets of polymers of the addition polymerizable monomer composition of the invention in which varying amounts of different PSUAs with varying amounts of combined methyl methacrylate MMA or t butyl styrene , hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA , and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate EDMA were employed. The tensile strength, tensile modulus, oxygen permeability, and wetting angle of each of the sheets were determined and are given inTABLE I.

PSUA in the polymerizable composition there was an increase in the oxygen permeability and an essentially corresponding decrease in the tensile modulus of cast sheets of the polymers obtained from the composition. It is also apparent from TABLE I that compositions containing t butylstyrene gave polymers having oxygen permeability substantially higher than that of identical compositions having methyl methacrylate instead of t butylstyrene.EXAMPLES XIII XIX An indication of the hydrolytic stability of the optical articles of the invention was determined by measuring the change in tensile strength and tensile modulus of 300 micrometer thick films of PSUA copolymers before and after they were boiled in water 1000C for seven days. For use in the test, a series of films were prepared according to the procedure described in Example II which contained from 30 to 45 percent by weight of PSUA A.The before and after tensile strength and moduli data given in TABLE II, below were the average and standard deviation of three samples for each of these determinations.

The data of TABLE II show that there was no statistically significant decrease in tensile strength or modulus by boiling the sheets in water for seven days, indicating that the sheets were hydrolytically stable under these conditions. EXAMPLE XX COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE An organopolysiloxane methacrylate was prepared and polymerized to provide a polymer for comparison of its suitability for use as a contact lens with the contact lenses of the invention that were prepared from an organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate. A mixture of 38.17 g bctamethylcyclotetra siloxane, 7.73 g bis methacryloyloxypropyl tetramethyl disiloxane, 0.22 g activated charcoal powder, and 0.02 g concentrated sulfuric acid was agitated and heated at 650C for 22 hours. The mixture was then filtered and the filtrate subjected to a reduced pressure of about 0.2 Torr while being heated at 650C for 24 hours on a rotary evaporator. The resulting colorless liquid was a linear poly dimethylsiloxane that had a number average molecular weight of about 2090 and terminal methacryloyloxypropyl groups as determined by NMR spectroscopy. A solution of 7.2 g of the organopolysiloxane methacrylate as prepared above, 8.1 g methyl methacrylate, 0.85 g ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 0.85 g hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and 0.08 g Darocuret 1173 was degassed, cast into a mold, and polymerized as described in Example II. A cloudy sheet was obtained indicating the composition to be unsatisfactory for use in contact lenses. A sheet prepared as above, but using PSUA A, an organopolysiloxane urethane acrylate, in place of the nonurethane group containing organopolys iloxane methacrylate was clear and transparent and very satisfactory for use in contact lenses. Various modifications and alterations of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention, and it should be understood that this invention is not to be unduly limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.
