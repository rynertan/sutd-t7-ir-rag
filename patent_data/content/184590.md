# Method of continuously analyzing fluidized body by laser.

## Abstract
A focusing lens 3 having a focal length f is provided at a position spaced a distance L apart from a substance 4 to be measured in the fiuidized conditions, control is ef fected such that the relationship between L and f constantly satisfied a formula 0.95f L 1.05f, and a light emitted by high output pulse laser 1 irra diating the surface of the substance 4 to be measured is spectroscopically analyzed, so that the influence of varia tions on the surface of the substance 4 to be measured can be avoided and stabilized laser emission spectroscopically analysis on line can be conducted.
