# Method of and system for satellite switched time division multiple access.

## Abstract
A method of and a system for satellite switched time division multiple access are described, which are particularly suited to stations with a multiplicity of traf fic relations through each can have low traffic volume. The samples of PCM streams are reorganized by a de vice allocated at the TDMA terminal input an auxiliary apparatus is placed on board the satellite to effect a different addressing of the switching matrix and a device for recovering PCM streams is placed at the output of the TDMA terminal. Synchronizing problems are also solved.
