# PROCESS FOR ENHANCING CATALYTIC RESPONSE OF ASPHALT OXIDATION CATALYST

## Abstract
Sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate and other carbonate catalysts ground to fine particle sizes 95 plus passing through a 200 mesh sieve 75Âµm are more active than commercially available grades of such catalysts when oxidizing asphalt fluxes, permitting reduction in oxidation time, reduction in required catalyst quantities and improve ment in product quality.
