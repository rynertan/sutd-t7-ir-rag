# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ACCUMULATING REAMS OF PAPER SHEETS

## Abstract
Reams 6 of paper sheets are accumulated into stacks by moving a file of successive reams with the upper reach of a belt conveyor 7 which is flanked by a shifting arm 26 and an elevator platform 82 . The arm 26 is moved by 27,28 transversely of the conveyor 7 to shift a group of reams 6 onto the platform 82 before the platform descends, once or more than once, to provide room for additional groups of reams 6 on top of the previously shifted group or groups. The platform 82 is thereupon lifted to a level above the conveyor 7 , and a pusher 102 is actuated to transfer the stacks of reams from the platform 82 into a storage conveyor 16 which is operated by 18 intermittently and can gather a substantial number of reams 6 . The arm 26 is raised above the upper reach of the conveyor 7 during movement back to its starting position so as not to interfere with the operation of the conveyor, and the various positions of the platform 82 and pusher 102 are monitored to automatically initiate the next following movements of such parts.
