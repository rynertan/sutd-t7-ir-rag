# Content induced transaction overlap communication system.

## Abstract
A content induced transaction overlap communication system for transmitting data over a single communication channel 30 between a plurality of senders 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and at least one receiver 20 . The senders simultaneously transmit the highest order bits of their data word, one bit at a time in serial fashion and monitor the state of the communi cation channel. Transmission of data bits is terminated by all senders 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 which detect a difference between the state of their transmitted data bit and the state of the communication channel. Bit competition performed at the end of each transmitted data word determines among those senders still having data bits remaining to be transmitted which sender has lexicographically the next smallest word and activates that sender to transmit its remaining data bits. This procedure continues until all of the senders have completed the sending of their data word.
