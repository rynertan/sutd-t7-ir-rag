# A device for picking up oil from water and from the surface of water.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a device for picking up oil from water and from the surface of water, the device being installed to a water craft 1 and comprising at least one collecting means 7 passing around rolls 3 and being installed obliquely, there being at the upper end of the collecting means devices for removing the oil collected by the collecting means and for di recting it into a tank in the water craft. The object is especially to eliminate the disadvantage of previously known devices to the mat type that, when the craft moves, the mat tends to di rect water and, along with it, also oil to the sides, past the mat. In accordance with the invention the device comprises a num ber of parallel loop like collecting means 7 , each of which is made up of pieces 4 provided with upwards and sidewards extending bristles and fixed to a chain 5 , the sidewards di rected bristles extending sufficiently far to come into contact with each other, but allowing water to flow without hindrance through the mat 2 .
