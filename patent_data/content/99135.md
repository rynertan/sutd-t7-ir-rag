# Dynamic gate array whereby an assembly of gates is simulated by logic operations on variables selected according to the gates.

## Abstract
A gate assembly is simulated as logic groups, which are successively checked in steps for input signals of the respective logic groups to provide output signals thereof. A decode memory 24 is preliminarily loaded with decoding patterns. A pair of decoding patterns define a pair of variable sets which are preliminarily decided for each gate as regards a logic signal pair of each logic group input signal. In a gate memory unit 25 , the variable pair is subjected to a logic operation decided for the gate to provide a logic signal of the logic group output signal. At first, a register set 15 is loaded with an input signal of the assembly. Later, the register set is loaded with the output signal of each logic group, which output signal is used in a next succeeding step as the input signal of another logic group. Preferably, each logic group input signal is given by eight logic signals. In this event, each logic signal may be given as a permutation of logic one and or zero states, sixteen in number.
