# Process for the production of polyester.

## Abstract
A process for the production of polyester is disclosed, comprising feeding an ester compound made mainly of te rephthalic acid and ethylene glycol or an oligomer thereof to a final polymerization reactor, and then polymerizing it in the form of fine molten particles in an inert gas stream, wherein the ester compound has an intrinsic viscosity η of not more than 0.4 dl g and a carboxyl terminal group con centration COOH of not more than 90 η ⁰ ⁴ µeq g, and the fine particles have an average particle diameter of from 0.015 to 0.5 mm.
