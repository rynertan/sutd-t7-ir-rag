# Side and heel lasting machine.

## Abstract
A side and heel lasting machine. The machine serves to adhere the unwiped margin 107A,107B of a shoe upper assembly 102 , whose toe portion 107 has been wiped, to the periphery region of the assembly insole 103 . Lasting pads 1A,1B are employed to keep the margin 107A,107B in position during application of adhesive from nozzels 105A, 105B that are spring loaded to press outwardly and track the upstanding margin 107A,107B when adhesive is applied in the region A between the insole 103 and the margin 107A,107B . The pads 1A,1B are then raised and urged inwardly to press the margin 107A,107B onto the insole 103 . The top edge 2A of inner lasting pads 1A are folded onto the insole during the wiping action the direction of forces upon the top edges 2A of the lasting pads 1A is changed during wiping to increase downward wiping forces upon the margin 107A,107B . A quick release mechanism 7,7A,7B,7C is provided to permit removal and replacement of the lasting pads 1A,1B without need to remove any screw type fasteners.
