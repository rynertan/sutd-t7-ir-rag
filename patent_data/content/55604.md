# PRESSURE REGULATING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A regulating system for regulating the pressure in a fluid flow line particularly an L.P.G. supply line to the carburation system of an internal combustion engine comprises a regulating device connected in the flow line for varying the fluid flow rate along the line and an electro fluid control loop comprising a feed back line connected to the flow line to provide a feed back pressure related to the pressure in the flow line and a control arrangement in which the feed back pressure is compared with a reference pressure to provide an electrical output signal for controlling the regulating device in the sense to maintain a predetermined relationship between the feed back pressure and the reference pressure. The control arrangement has a pair of control chambers, each control chamber being divided into sub chambers by a flexible diaphragm and the feed back pressure being con nected to act in one sub chamber and the reference pressure being connected to act in the other sub chamber. A di aphragm position senser is associated with each control chamber and comprises an electric senser having a senser coil whose electrical output is representative of the distance of the diaphragm from it, the arrangement being such that a variation in the feed back pressure in relation to the refer ence pressure causes the diaphragms to move in opposite directions relatively to their associated sensor coils. Compa rator means are provided for comparing the electrical outputs from the senser coils to provide an output for controlling said regulating device.
