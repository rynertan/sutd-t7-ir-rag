## Description
The invention is concerned generally with a method for electromagnetic heating by induction of a roll, in particular of a calender roll, used in the manufacture of paper or of some other web formed product, in which method a variable magnetic flux is directed to the shell of the roll, free of contact, by a magnetizing device through air gaps, the said magnetic flux inducing eddy currents in the shell of the roll, which eddy currents generate heat owing to the resistance of the shell of the roll, the magnetizing device comprises a plurality of component cores side by side which are excited by a common magnetizing current or only by a respective magnetizing current. A further subject of the present invention is generally a paper machine roll device intended for carrying out the method in accordance with the present invention, in particular for the calender of a paper machine, in which roll device there is a roll arranged as revolving around its central axis, a magnetizing device being arranged in the proximity of the outer shell of the roll, which magnetizing device comprises a number of component cores as well as an electromagnetic coil or coils, by means of which the iron core is magnetized by means of AC electricity, and electricity supply means, by which the said magnetizing coil or coils are supplied with electricity of an appropriate constant or variable frequency or frequencies. In respect of the prior art technology related to the invention, reference is made, by way of example, to British patent application 2,083,729 and Finnish patent applications 820733, 821838 and 824281. From said GB A 2,083,729, an electromagnetically heated calender roll is known in which several magnets have been fitted into blocks placed side by side in the axial direction and leaving at least the working area of the outer circumference free, whereat in each block or group of blocks the set value corresponding to the change in the magnetic flux in the shell of the roll can be varied separately, and whereat, in the roll, at least one temperature measurement value detector is used, which indicates the measurement value corresponding to the factual value temperature of the outer circumferential face of the roll at different positions placed axially apart from each other, and which device comprises a control circuit system which changes the set values on the basis of the measurement values and of the predetermined temperature profile for the outer circumferential face of the roll. All the magnetizing shoes are located inside the shell of the roll. However, the temperature of the outer circumferential face of the roll affects the web to be treated. Sufficiently sharp and great differences in temperature are not achieved in the axial direction according to the GB patent application, because the temperature differences become equalized in the relatively thick outer circumferential face as a result of heat conduction. For the same reason, the adjustment of temperature is slow. According to Finnish patent application 824281 applicant Valmet OY , the calender roll is heated inductively by means of eddy currents, and the heating by means of eddy currents is directed only to the surface layer of the roll, made of a ferromagnetic material, and from outside the roll only. According to the said application, an annular thermal insulation layer has been made onto the roll frame, which layer is of a magnetically non conductive material, and on top of the said layer there is the surface layer of a ferromagnetic material, whose wall thickness is as small as is possible from the point of view of mechanical loads. By means of this arrangement, attempts are made to direct the heating to the heating of only the surface layer of the outer circumferential face of the roll in order to improve the efficiency of heating and to accelerate the adjustment of the temperature profile. The arrangement in accordance with the said patent application is, however, mechanically quite difficult and expensive to accomplish. As is well known, changes in the temperature profile of the calender roll affect the web to be calendered in two ways. Firstly, the temperature acts directly upon the surface properties of the web to be calendered, and secondly the diameter of the calender roll is changed to a certain extent as a function of the temperature, and these variations in the diameter, of course, act upon the pressure profile of the calendering nip and thereby upon the thickness profile of the web to be calendered. US A 4,384,514, on which the preamble of the independent claim is based, discloses a method and device for controlling the electrical power or heating effect to the coils of the magnetizing device, in dependence of the profile of one or more properties, such as the thickness, of the web along the roll. An object of this invention is to provide a method and a device by means of which the heating effect can be adjusted in a controlled way and rapidly in the axial direction of the calender roll for the purpose of controlling the thickness profile and or the of the web to be calendered. A further object ot the invention is to provide such an inductive heating method of the sort concerned and such a method for adjustment of the temperature profile of the roll in which the transfer of power to the calender roll has an improved efficiency overall efficiency . A further object of the invention is to provide a said heating method in connection with which it is possible to apply such closed systems of adjustment of the temperature profile in which the problems of stability have been solved better than in prior art. A further object of the invention is to provide such a method for the adjustment of the temperature profile in which, together with adjustment of the positions of adjoining cores or component cores of induction coils and adjustment of the air gap, it is possible to use and advantageous novel mode of controlling the heating power. In order to achieve the object given above and those that will come out later, the invention has the features according to the characterizing clause of the independent claim. In the following, the invention will be described in detail with reference to the certain exemplifying embodiments of the invention, illustrated in the figures of the attached drawing, the invention being not confined to the details of the said examples. Fig. 1 is a schematical illustration of a first exemplifying embodiment of the heating device in accordance with the invention.

Fig. 6 illustrates such an exemplifying embodiment of the invention as is based on the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and in which in connection with adjustment of the air gap, the adjustment of the heating power is used. Fig. 7 shows the current in the resonance circuit used in the invention, as a function of the frequency. The calender roll 10 shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4 is a roll either of a machine stack or of a supercalender. The roll 10 is, in a way in itself known, a part of a calender stack consisting of calender rolls. The roll 10 is provided with a smooth and hard face, and, in the way shown in Fig. 4, it has a cylindrical shell, which is made of an appropriate ferromagnetic material, which has been chosen in view of the strength properties of the roll and the inductive and electromagnetic heating in accordance with the invention. The roll 10 is journalled as revolving around its center axis K K by means of its ends 11 and its axle journals 12. The axle journals 12 are provided with bearings 13, which are fitted in bearing housings 14. The bearing housings 14 are fixed to the support frame 16 of the roll, which frame rests on a base 15. In Figs. 3 and 4, the roll 10 is the lowermost roll in the calender stack, and, in a way in itself known, it forms a calendering nip with the counter roll not shown , whereat the paper or board web not shown to be calendered passes through the said nip. In the interior space 10a of the roll 10 shown in Fig. 4, it is possible to accommodate the, in themselves known, devices of variable or adjustable crown, for which an abundant space is allowed owing to the invention, because, in the interior 10a of the roll 10, it is not necessary to use heating equipment operating by means of a liquid medium or equivalent, whereat the use of such heating equipment in connection with the present invention is, however, not excluded. The roll 10 is arranged so as to be heated, in accordance with the invention, inductively and electromagnetically by means of eddy currents so that the temperature of the outer circumferential face 10 of the shell is, owing to this heating, raised to a considerably high level, as a rule about 70 C to 100 C. In order to accomplish inductive heating, at one side of the roll, in the same horizontal line with each other, component cores 20₁, 20₂... 20 Fig. 1 show magnetizing coil 30₁ ... 30₇ of its own for each component core 20₁ ...20 According to Figs. 3 and 4, the magnetizing coil 30 of the iron core 20 has one winding only, which can usually be accomplished most advantageously both mechanically and electrically. According to Figs. 3 and 4, the component cores 20₁...20 Each component core separately has been arranged so as to be displaceable in the radial plane of the roll 10 for the purpose of adjustment of the magnitude of the air gap Δ and, at the same time, of the heating output. For this purpose, each component core has been attached by means of screws 24 to vertical arms 23, which are, by the intermediate of horizontal arms 26, linked by means of the shaft 25 to the side flange 17 of the frame 16. An eccentric cam 28 has been attached to the lower end of the vertical arm 23, which said cam can be turned around the shaft C by means of a stepping motor 29 arrow D in Fig. 4 so that the arm 23 pivots around its link shaft 25 arrow A in Fig. 4 , whereby the air gap is changed. As a rule, the air gap Δ may vary, e.g., within the range of 1 to 100 mm, preferably within the range of 1 to 30 mm. The displacement of the component cores may, of course, also be arranged by means of other mechanisms. One important feature of the equipment embodiment in accordance with Figs. 3 and 4 is that the single turn magnetizing coil 30 or loop has been fitted stationarily on its support arms 31. The arms 31 are attached to the end 17 of the frame by means of screws 32. The parallel branches of the coil 30 are supported on the said arms 31, of an electrically insulating material, e.g., teflon, and with a sufficient play in the grooves between the branches 21a, 21b and 21c of the magnetic core so that, even though the coil 30 is stationary, the positions of the component cores of the iron core can be adjusted in accordance with the invention. In Fig. 3, the end of the coil 30 is denoted with the reference numeral 30 . The coil or magnetizing loop 30 is made of a copper pipe of sufficient sectional area, through which pipe the circulation of the cooling water has been arranged, being illustrated in Fig. 3 by means of arrows W Fig. 4 shows draw springs 27 attached to the vertical arms 23, which springs keep the component cores steadily in position and the dimension Δ of the air gap stable. The stepping motor 29 and the eccentric cam 28 are arranged so that the component cores 20 In respect of the electrotechnical background of the invention the following is stated. When a varying magnetic field is arranged into an electrically conductive material, eddy current and hysteresis losses are generated in the material, and the material becomes warm. The power P of the eddy currents depends on the intensity B of the magnetic field and on the frequency f of change in the magnetic field, as follows The varying magnetic field generated on the roll 30 is closed between the front face of the iron core and the air gaps 40a, 40b and 40c through the shell of the roll 10. This magnetic field induces eddy currents into the surface layer of the roll 10, which currents produce heat owing to the high resistance of the roll 10. The distribution of the eddy currents, induced in the roll 10, in the direction x of the radius of the roll follows the law The formula indicates that when the frequency is increased, the depth of penetration is reduced. When steel is heated, both the electrical conductivity and the permeability decrease with an increase in temperature the permeability is assumed to remain constant up to Curie temperature. As a rule, heating powers of the order of 4.3 to 8.4 kW m² are used in the invention. As is well known, the smaller the air gap Δ is, the larger is the proportion of the electricity power passed into the device via the coil 30, that is transferred into the roll 10 to be heated. Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of the arrangement and electricity supply in accordance with the invention. The power is taken out of a 50 Hz three phase network 3 380 V . By means of a rectifier 33, the AC current is converted to DC electricity, which is converted by means of an inverter 34 in itself known, based on power electronics, so that its frequency becomes suitable for the purposes of the invention. The frequency f that is applicable in the invention is within the range of about 0.5 to 50 kHz, preferably about 1 to 30 kHz. This power, which is to be characterized as medium frequency in induction heating, is passed through a matching transformer 35 and a capacitor C The adjustment of the positions of the component cores 20₁ ... 20 In accordance with Fig. 5, the power of the inverter 34 is supplied through the matching transformer 35 into a LC resonance circuit in accordance with the invention, whose effect and operation are illustrated by Fig. 7. The transformer 35 comprises, in a way in itself known, a primary circuit 35a, an iron core 35b, and a secondary circuit 35c. The secondary circuit includes n pieces of tapping points 45₁ ... 45 Fig. 7 illustrates the dependence of the current I in the circuit 37 from the frequency f The efficiency of the transfer of the heating power is at its optimum when the operation takes place at the resonance frequency f In accordance with Fig. 5, a series capacitor C Fig. 5 shows, by means of broken lines, a parallel capacitor C In the above equation, 5 is a coefficient dependent on the resistance R. However, from the point of view of the objectives of the invention, as a rule, a series resonance circuit is preferable, in particular in view of adjustment and control. Within the scope of the invention, the resonance frequency is chosen preferably within the range of f Depending on the dimensioning of the coil cores 20 and on the air gap Δ between the roll 10 and the cores 20 According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in order to keep the efficiency of the power supply high and to eliminate phenomena of instability, i.e. the risk of runaway , the operating frequency f The measurement of the impedance of the resonance circuit 37 may be based, e.g., on the measurement of the current I passing in the circuit. This mode of measurement is illustrated in Fig. 5 by block 46, from which the control signal b is passed to the control unit 47, which changes the frequency f Fig. 6 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention, in which each component core 20 When the air gap of each component core 20 is now adjusted by means of the stepping motors 29, the resonance frequency f By means of a circuit similar to Fig. 6, within the scope of the invention, it is also possible to accomplish a different power adjustment so that it is similar to an adjustment of a basic setting and not an operational adjustment proper. In such a case, by changing each frequency f₁ ... f It is an advantage of this mode of adjustment that the interdependence between the frequency f
