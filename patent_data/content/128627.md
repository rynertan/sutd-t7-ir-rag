# Process of determining the concentration of halogen in organic samples.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an analytical method for determination of organic halogen in a sample. The results of the present method are superior to those known methods, and are independent of the physico chemical properties of the halo organic compounds in the sample. The method comprises subjecting a sample containing a halo organic compound, preferably in solution in an aprotic solvent, to electrolysis, and determining the resulting halide ion con centration.
