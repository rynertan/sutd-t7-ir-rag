## Description
The present invention relates to a shorting bar assembly which provides a wiping action during mating and unmating of an associate electrical connector. There are many times in the electrical industry when it is desirable to have a connector which will short selected terminals in an unmated condition. An example of such an electrical connector is disclosed in EP A 0 112 711 which was published on 04.07.84 and is, therefore, to be considered as the state of the art according to Article 54 3 EPC. That application is particularly directed towards a shorting system. However, there is a problem in this type of electrical connector in that, because of environmental conditions, corrosion may occur on the shorting element so that incomplete or inconsistent shorting takes place. It is the object of the present invention to overcome the deficiency of the prior art by providing an electrical connector in which the shorting member has a wiping action to assure a positive shorting contact is effected. There is disclosed in FR A 2 397 078, an electrical connector having a terminal carrying member defining a plurality of spaced terminal passages, a like plurality of terminals each mounted in a respective passage and having a mating portion with a resilient free end flexed during mating and unmating of said connector, a shorting bar assembly to selectively short at least pairs of said terminals, said shorting bar assembly comprising at least one conductive shorting bar member secured transversely of the terminals, each said at least one shorting bar member having a body portion with means engaging respective terminals in a loaded condition, in an unmated condition of said connector, said terminal and said engaging means being disengaged upon mating of said connector. The shorting bar, which does not intersect the longitudinal axes of the terminals have a body portion with at least two tines formed integrally with and depending from said body portion, said tines being disengaged from the terminals by means of an actuating member on a housing of a mating connector. According to the present invention, as claimed in Claim 1, said body portion is oriented in a plane intersecting longitudinal axes of said terminals, and each depending tine extends at an angle with respect to said plane and with respect to the longitudinal axis of a respective terminal to engage the free end thereof when the connector is in an unmated condition and each respective terminal is deflected out of contact with said tine upon said connector becoming mated. A shorting bar assembly according to the present invention is defined in claim 8. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, an electrical connector 10 of hermaphroditic construction is illustrated as representative of the type of connector which could embody the present invention. The connector 10 has a pair of mating covers 12, 14 of insulating material enclosing a terminal carrying member 16 and including polarizing means 18 and latching means 20. Figure 2 shows the terminal carrying member 16 which is a generally rectangular member of rigid insulative material defining a plurality of parallel spaced terminal passages 22 in an area enclosed by integral bottom wall 24, spaced parallel side walls 26, 28, and top wall 30. The bottom wall 24 is profiled to receive the respective terminals 32 therein. Each of the side walls 26, 28 is provided with a profiled groove 34, 36 respectively, extending normal to the bottom wall 24. Each terminal 32 is stamped and formed from metal stock and has a mating portion 38 and a conductor engaging portion 40, here represented as a slotted wire barrel of known configuration. The mating portion 38 has an elongated body 42 including mounting tines 44 and a cantilever beam portion 46 folded back upon itself with a surface 48 thereof forming the contact area and the free end 50 forming a shorting bar engaging portion. The shorting bar assembly 52 is formed by an elongated insulative member 54 having latching means 56, 58 on the ends thereof and at least one shorting bar 60, 62 fixedly attached thereto. Each at least one shorting bar 60, 62 comprises a metal body portion 64, 66 having at least two tines 68, 70, 72, 74 depending therefrom at an angle with respective to the plane of the body portion 64, 66 and the longitudinal axis of a respective terminal 32. The shorting bars 60, 62 have been here shown with apertures 76, 78 through which pegs 80 extend and which are heat staked to secure the bars 60, 62 to the member 54. Clearly other mounting means, such as force fit into a slot, and or latching barbs, could likewise be used. The shorting bars 60, 62 are separated from each other by insulative member 82, which is provided with mounting apertures 84. It will be readily understood from Figures 2 and 4 that the present invention is assembled by first inserting the terminals 32 into their respective passages 22 with the terminals 32 being secured therein by engagement of the latches 44 in the passage walls. The shorting bar assembly 52 is then placed in the respective slots 34, 36 in the side walls 26, 28 and secured in place by the latching means 56, 58. This places the shorting bar tines 68, 70, 72, 74 into a loaded engagement with the free ends 50 of the respective terminals 32. This is the condition noted by reference numerals 68A and 50A in Figure 8. Mating of the connector members, as shown in Figure 7, causes the free end 50 of the respective terminal 32 to be deflected downwardly allowing the shorting bar tines 68, 70, 72, 74 to move from a loaded to an unloaded condition as noted by reference numerals 68B and 50B. During this combined movement there is a wipe of the tine across the surface of the free end 50 of the terminal 32. The loaded, shorting condition will also be understood from a comparison of Figure 5 to the unloaded, non shorting, mated condition of Figure 7. The present invention may be utilized in many embodiments and is not to be considered as being restricted by the single embodiment illustrated in a connector having only four terminals which are shorted in pairs. Any number of terminals in any combination of groups could be shorted in similar fashion. Also the amount of wipe could be controlled by the length of the tines and deflection of the terminal. Further, the tines could be plated with any of the known plating materials.
