# Homologation of carbonyloxy containing compounds and catalyst therefor.

## Abstract
This invention produces higher homologs, i.e., differing by at least a CHâ‚‚ unit, of carbonyloxy containing com pounds by treating the carbonyloxy containing compounds with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a ruthenium containing compound, a proton donor, an iodide promoter, and optionally, a manganese containing com pound.
