# Fat blend.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fat blend comprising an oil liquid at room temperature and a hardstock the former pref erably being an oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acid residues such as linoleic acid and to a process for the preparation of such a fat blend. The fat blend can comprise 2 35 parts by weight of hard stock, 30 98 parts by weight of oil liquid at room temperature and 0 35 parts by weight of hydrogenated fat having a slip melting point of 25 45 C. The fat blend can be used for produc ing margarines, low calorie margarines containing e.g. 35 60 by wt. of fat, and cooking fats. The hardstock is an interesterified hydrogenated blend of 1 triglycerides derived from a fat rich in fatty acid residues having 16 18 carbon atoms, most of which are saturated, and 2 a lower melting fraction of a fat rich in lauric acid residues. The hydrogenation can be carried out before or after interes terification. The ratio of 1 2 can be 20 80 80 20 , prefer ably 40 58 60 42 .
