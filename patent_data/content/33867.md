# Rupture disc alarm system.

## Abstract
A monitor system 2 for sensing the failure of a rupture disc 12 and activating an alarm in response to such a failure. The system also senses potential failure of a rupture disc. The system includes a failsafe signal carry ing loop 50 which is broken when the rupture disc fails, thereby interrupting the signal. The system also includes a signal sensor 42 which recognizes a signal interruption or substantial modification in the signal and initiates and cooperates with an alarm device 43 to provide notice to an operator or a safety device that the rupture disc has failed.
