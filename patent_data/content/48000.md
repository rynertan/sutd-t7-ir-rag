## Description
The present invention relates to a novel method for preparing pteridine derivatives, in particular methotrexate N 4 2,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methyl amino benzoyl glutamic acid and analogues thereto.Methotrexate has been extensively used for over 30 years in cancer chemotherapy as an antineoplastic agent useful in the treatment of acute leukemia and other cancerous diseases. In the past, methotrexate has been accepted in a rather impure state and with unspecified optical rotation cf. U.S.P. XIX 1973 74, p. 315 andB.P. 73, p. 300 .Methotrexate may be represented by the formulaEMI1.1 wherein the moieties of which the molecule is built up are represented as the pteridine moiety , P, the benzene moiety , B, and the glutamate moiety , G. In all existing patent literature concerning the preparation of methotrexate and derivatives thereof , the glutamate moiety G has been attached to the benzene moiety B and then to molecules from which the pteridine moiety P was built up. However, the more steps in which the optically active G moiety participates, the higher is the risk of racemisation cf. e.g. U.S. Patent No.4,057,548 1977 which describes a method where the final step to methotrexate diethylester involving building up the pyrimidine ring in the P moiety results in complete racemisation . N acylation of L glutamic acid where the PB moiety is transformed to an active acylating agent like a mixed anhydride and is then used for acylation of L glutamic acid is described in the literature M. Chaykovsky et al., J. Med. Chem. 1975 18, 909 , but usually results in low yields 10 40 .The present invention uses a completely new strategy in the synthesis of methotrexate and analogues thereto and provides an easy and clean running procedure to obtain a high yield of methotrexate ester which may thereafter be hydrolysed to methotrexate.In the method of the invention, the NH2 group in the G moiety as ester is activated, and the activated G moiety is reacted with the PB moiety.Hence, the invention provides a method of preparing compounds of the general formula IEMI2.1 wherein R1 is NH2 or OH, R2 is NH2 or NHR5, wherein R5 is lower alkyl, R is H or lower alkyl, m is an integer up to 4, n is an integer 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, halogen or trifluormethyl, and R7 is H or lower alkyl, in L, D, or D,L form, wherein a compound of the general formula IIEMI2.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, m and n are as defined above, and, if required, R3 in the meaning hydrogen is protected with a protecting group such as an acetyl or trifluoroacetyl group, is reacted with a compound of the general formula IIIEMI3.1 wherein R 7 is lower alkyl, whereafter, if required, a protected amino group NR3 is deprotected, and R 7 is, if desired, hydrolysed 7 to yield a compound of formula I wherein R is hydrogen.When R1 and R2 are each NH2, R3 is CH3, and R4 and R7 are hydrogen, n 1, and m 4, the compound I is methotrexate, and a preferred embodiment of the invention comprises preparing methotrexate by reacting a corresponding compound II with a compound III whereinR 7 is ethyl and thereafter hydrolysing resulting compound to yield methotrexate.In the compound III, the glutamate moiety is preferably in optically active form such as L form or D form, and the resulting methotrexate will, correspondingly, be L or D methotrexate, respectively.Compared with the conventional strategy for the synthesis of methotrexate, the process of the invention provides several advantageous features The moiety which is activated in the synthesis is the G moiety which is a much cheaper moiety than the GB moiety. This is an important advantage as the activated moiety is often used in excess. As mentioned above, no racemisation takes place in the synthesis stage.The PB moiety used in the preparation of methotrexate according to the strategy of the present invention may be made in a manner known per se M. Chaykovsky et al., J. Med. Chem. 17 1974 , 1212 , but according to one aspect of the invention, the preparation of the PB moiety is modified to yield a particularly pure PB moiety, such as is discussed below in connection with the discussion of the preparation of the compounds of the general formula II.The compounds III are novel compounds and constitute an aspect of the present invention. According to a preferred embodiment,R 7 in the compounds III is ethyl. The compounds III are prepared by reacting phosphorus trichloride with a glutamic acid R 7 diester.The phosphorus trichloride used in this reaction should be of a high purity. The reaction is suitably performed in an anhydrous basic reaction medium such as dry pyridine. The reaction product partially crystallises to form a crystal slurry which may be used in the reaction with compound II without further purification. This reaction is suitably performed in the same reaction medium.As indicated above, the compounds of the general formula II in whichR1 and R2 are NH2, may be prepared as described in the literature or in analogy thereto M. Chaykovsky et al., J. Med. Chem. 17 1974 , 1212 , but preferably with special measures to reduce the content of the corresponding N10 methylpteroic acid in order to increase the purity of the resulting compound of the general formulaI. A suitable improved synthesis of the compounds II in which R1 and R2 are NH2 comprises reacting a compound of the formula IVEMI4.1 L wherein R3, R4, m and n are as defined above, with a salt of guanidine with a weak organic or inorganic acid such as a acetate or carbonate in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide.In a preferred embodiment of this process, the compound IV is 4 5 amino 6 cyano pyrazinyl methyl methylamino benzoic acid which is reacted with guanidine carbonate in dimethyl sulfoxide to yield 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroic acid as the compound II. methylpteroic acid as the compound II.The compounds of the general formula II in which R1 is OH may be prepared in a corresponding manner, but using a compound of the general formula IV containing an ester group instead of the cyano group. Compounds of the general formula II in which R2 isNHR5 may be prepared in an analogous manner, using, instead of guanidine, an R2 substituted guanidine.S. Goldschmidt and Hans Lautenschläger, Ann. 581, 68 1953 , suggested the activation of NH2 groups in amino acid esters by conversion into phosphorazo compounds for the synthesis of diand tripeptides. However, this reference contains no indication of the use of phosphorazo compounds in an unorthodox new synthesis strategy for the preparation of methotrexate. and analogues thereto.Example 1.A solution of PCl3 5.1 ml, 0.058 mol in dry pyridine 20 ml was added dropwise to a solution of diethyl L glutamate hydrochloride 27.8 g, 0.116 mol in dry pyridine 20 ml with vigorous stirring at OOC. After the addition, the thick crystal slurry was stirred for approximately 1 hour without cooling. This slurry was poured into a slurry of 86 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroic acid containing 9 H2O and 4.7 HCl 8.7 g, 0.023 mol in dry pyridine 150 ml at 70 C. The resulting clear solution pyridine 150 ml at 70 was kept at 110 C for 2 hours whereafter it was cooled to 35 C and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure at 70 800C. The residual oil was shaken with 250 ml H2O, and the pH of the slurry formed was adjusted to 3 with N HCl approx.120 ml . The yellowish brown solid was filtered and washed with water. The filter cake was air dried, whereafter its weight was 12.8 g, corresponding to a quantitative yield of methotrexate diethylester hydrochloride. A slurry of the hydrochloride in ethanol 600 ml was neutralized to pH 9 with N NaOH 12 ml , whereafter filtration was performed.The filtrate was concentrated at 300C, and the residue was stirred with chloroform 500 ml and water 400 ml . The chloroform phase was isolated, washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration and evaporation of chloroform, the residue 10.4 g was recrystallized from acetonitrile, to yield 7 g 60 pure methotrexate diethylester, yielding, on saponification at room temperature in a mixture of ethanol 180 ml and N sodium hydroxide 35 ml , methotrexate dihydrate in 89 yield.
