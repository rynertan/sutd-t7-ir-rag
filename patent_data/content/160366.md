## Abstract
A hydraulic turbine for use underwater which includes an impellar 2 mounted for rotation in a casing 1 and having an axial outlet 4 , the impeller 2 being surrounded by a ring of equally spaced injectors 7 for directing water under pressure from a circumferential outer chamber 5 onto the impeller 2 at an angle inclined with respect to the impeller radius to the injector 7 , wherein the impeller 2 has equally spaced blades 10 which are shaped such that they always receive water directed onto them at an angle of about 90 with respect to the tangent to the blade surface at the point of impact. Each injector 7 may have a downstream wall 8 inclined at an angle of 45 with respect to the impeller radius to the injector 7 . There may be more blades 10 than injectors 7 , the number being chosen so that the blades 10 pass the injectors 7 at different times.

## Description
Title HYDRAULIC TURBINESThis invention relates to hydraulic turbines of the type intended for use underwater and arranged to be driven by water supplied to it under pressure, the turbine having an impeller upon an output shaft to which may be connected a tool, such as a cleaning brush.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved hydraulic turbine which is efficient in use and operates with the minimum vibration.The present invention consists in a hydraulic turbine which includes an impellar mounted for rotation in a casing and having an axial outlet. the impeller being surrounded by a ring of injectors for directing water under pressure from a circumferential outer chamber onto the impeller at an angle inclined with respect to the impeller radius to the injector, wherein the impeller has blades which are shaped such that they always receive water directed to them at an angle of about 90 with respect to the tangent to the blade surface at the point of impact. Each injector may have a downstream wall inclined at an angle of 450 with respect to the impeller radius to the injector. The injectors may be equally spaced and the impeller may have equally spaced blades with more blades than injectors, the number being chosen so that the blades pass the injectors at different times. The number of blades jay exceed the number of injectors by one.In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows one form of hydraulic turbine, according to the present invention, with part of its casing removed, andFigure 2 is a section taken on line 2 2 of Figure 1.In carrying the invention into effect according to one convenient mode by way of example. a hydraulic turbine includes a casing 1 in which an impeller 2 is mounted for rotation.The casing 1 has a tangential inlet 3 to receive a supply of water under pressure and an axial outlet 4 through which the water leaves after passing through the impeller 2.The casing 1 includes a circumferentially extending chamber 5 formed between the casing and an internal circular wall 6 having eight equally spaced slots 7 forming injectors through which the water passes to reach the impeller 2. Each injector 7 is inclined at an angle with respect to the impeller radius to the injector.and has a downstream wall 8 inclined at an angle of 450 to the radius. the outer wall 9 being curved to facilitate the flow of water through the injector. The impeller carries nine equally spaced curved blades 10 mounted between flanges 11, the shape of the blades being chosen so that as the impeller rotates under the effect of the water leaving the injector, the water always impinges upon the blade at about 900 to the tangent to the blade surface.In one embodiment. it was found that with the wall 8 inclined at an angle of 45 , the average direction of the water leaving the injector was inclined at an angle of about 400 to the radius to the injector. and the blade shape was designed accordingly to achieve the impact at about 900. However, other combinations of wall angle and blade form may be employed. Since there are nine blades and eight injectors. each blade will receive water from a given injector for about 400 of its travel past that injector and the instants at which the blades start to receive water and cease to receive water will be different for each blade thereby smoothing out possible fluctuations in the torque imparted to the impeller. Other combinations of the number of injectors and the number of blades are possible. For example there may be six injectors with seven blades or twelve injectors with thirteen blades.the combination being so chosen that the blades pass the injectors at different times.The blades are extended inwardly past the point where they cease to receive water from any injector so that the area of the blade surface can be made equal to or greater than the area of the outlet 4 to avoid creation of a back pressure.
