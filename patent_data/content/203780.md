# OPTICALLY NON LINEAR MATERIALS AND THIN FILMS INCORPORATING SUCH MATERIALS

## Abstract
A multi layer Langmuir Blodgett film having non linear op tical properties is described. Alternate layers of the film are composed of first and second elongate chromophore mol ecules extending transverse to the plane of the film in a Y con figuration. The molecules are synthesised so that when depos ited in a Y configuration they are non centrosymmetric and therefore exhibit significant optical nonlinearity.
