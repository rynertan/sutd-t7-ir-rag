# A gear shift control system.

## Abstract
A gear shift control system for an automatic transmission comprises an air flow sensor 1 which senses the quantity of air taken into an internal combustion engine and supplies a corresponding electrical signal Q to a differentiator 3 which provides a derivative q of the sensed intake air quantity. A vehicle speed sensor 4 senses the speed of rotation of the engine crankshaft to generate a corresponding signal V . A gear shift decision circuit 22 is receptive of signals from the air flow sensor 1 and the vehicle speed sensor 4 to define a gear shift control line on a two dimensional coordinate sys tem as a function of the received input signals on respective co ordinate axes. The derivative q of the sensed air quantity Q is used to shift the gear shift control line to a higher speed side of the co ordinate system to permit the transmission to effect downshift operation.
