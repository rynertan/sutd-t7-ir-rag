# Electric power supplying system, for the continuous transit system by magnet.

## Abstract
An electric power supplying system for the continuous transit system by magnetic CTM in which magnets attached to under parts of certain number of cars consisting the trains and energized regularly are attracted to magnetic belts of a plurality of magnetic belt conveyor units arranged at prede termined intervals along a running track thereby successive ly drawing and running the trains. There is provided a trolley wire which is divided at least into a certain number of insulated sections at intervals of a predetermined block section length and a predetermined no load current is supplied to the insulated sections of the trolley wire. When the current flowing to each insulated section of the trolley wire is within a predetermined range, the magnetic belt conveyor unit group corresponding to a block section following the insulated section with respect to the direction of train movement is operated.
