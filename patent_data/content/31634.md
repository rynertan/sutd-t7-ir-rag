# Method of separating isotopes.

## Abstract
A method of separating isotopes of an element, for example uranium, comprises providing molecules of a compound of the element which have isotopically shifted infrared absorption spectra. For uranium such molecules can be a mixture of ²³⁵UO₂ and ²³⁸UO₂ containing molecules of UO₂ A₁A₂ .L, where A₁ and A₂ are monovalent anions, such as CF₃COCHCOCF₃, and L is neutral ligand, such as trimethylphosphate. The molecules are irradiated at a first infrared absorption frequency to isotopically selectively dis sociate them and provide molecular fragments containing the element. The fragments are then irradiated at a second infrared absorption frequency shifted, preferably to the blue of the first frequency, by less than about 100 cm ¹. Preferably initiation of the second irradiation occurs be tween 0.1 and 10 microseconds after initiation of the first irradiation.

## Description
In Belgian Patent No. 867,647, a process for the separation of the isotopes of uranium is disclosed which employs a volatile UO2 bear ing molecule which is irradiated by means of a CO2 infrared laser. This Belgian patent teaches that isotopic selectivity can be achieved by operating in this fashion. U.S. Patent 4,096,046 teaches the use of two lasers for the separation of uranium isotopes. This patent teaches that UF5 is a more appropriate compound for laser isotope separation than is UP6, but that UF, is not volatile. Thus, this patent teaches the use of a first laser operating in the ultraviolet region for dissociating the UP6, and then the use of a second laser in the visible to far ultraviolet region in order to dissociate the transient UF, on an isotopically selective basis. This patent also suggests that if it were possible to selectively dissociate the UP6, that would be desirable. In U.S. Patent No. 4,096,046, the frequency of the second laser is specified as being anywhere from between 13,000 wavenumbers below to 67,000 wavenumbers above that of the irradiation of the first laser. This disclosure does not provide much guidance with regard to the proper frequency for irradiation with the second laser, at the second frequency, even in the case of the molecule disclosed in that patent, let alone for substantially dissimilar molecules. In accordance with the teachings of this invention, it has now been discovered that when employing molecules which contain an element whose isotopes are to be separated and which have an isotopically shifted infrared absorption spectrum associated with the isotopes of that element, such as UO2 A1A2 L, where U is that element, and 235 238 thus a mixture of U02 and UO2 containing molecules are provided, and irradiating such molecules at a first infrared absorption frequency so as to isotopically selectively dissociate said molecules, the energy need not be absorbed directly by the bond to be dissociated. Indeed, it is possible, and in fact desirable, that the energy be absorbed in a part of the molecule remote from the bond that dissociates.This separation of the site of energy deposition from the site of reaction within the moleculeensures that the site of energy deposition is preserved intact after dissociation and resides in one of the primary photofragments. Thus, in the case of molecules having the formula UO2 A1A2 L, energy deposited through absorption by the UO2 vibration results in dissociation of the molecule while leaving the UO2 moiety intact. Molecular fragments which contain the U02 moiety are thus provided by such dissociation and, in fact, after a period of time determined by the rate of appearance of these fragments, a further irradiation of these UO2 containing fragments can occur at a frequency shifted from the frequency of the first irradiation by less than about 100 cm 1. It has thus been realized that commercially available CO2 lasers can be employed not only for the initial isotopically selective irradiation step, but for the further selective irradiation of the UO2 bearing molecular fragments. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the second infrared absorption frequency is shifted to the blue of the first infrared absorption frequency.Preferably, in such a process, and particularly in connection with the irradiation of the above UO2 containing molecules, the irradiation at the second infrared absorption frequency occurs at least some time between 0.1 to 10 microseconds after initiation of the first irradiation step. In another embodiment of the present invention, irradiation of the fragments at a second infrared absorption frequency is carried out with sufficient laser power to cause an irreversible reaction to occur. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, however, irradiation at the second infrared absorption frequency is also carried out in an isotopically selective manner, and then irradiation at a third infrared absorption frequency is carried out, preferably with sufficient laser power to cause an irreversible reaction to occur.Further such steps could, however, also be utilized in such a process. Belgian Patent No. 867,647 discloses a process for the separation of isotopes by irradiating U02 containing compounds with infrared radiation which is preferen .tially absorbed by a molecular vibration of molecules of the compound containing a predetermined isotope of the element which is to be separated so as to provide excited molecules of that compound which are enriched in the molecules containing the predetermined isotope, thus enabling separation of those excited molecules. This may be accomplished by vaporizing volatile uranyl compounds having an isotopically shifted infrared absorption spectrum associated with the element whose isotopes are to be separated, and then irradiating the vaporized uranyl compound, preferably at wavelengths of from about 810 to 1116 cm . This irradiation may be carried out under conditions such that the excited molecules dissociate, so as to achieve separation of these excited molecules. In one embodiment, irradiation is carried out at temperatures of less than about 2000C, preferably less than about 1300C, and preferably under conditions whereby the uranyl compound has a vapor pressure of at least about 0.02 torr. In particular, the process is preferably carried out in an essentially collisionless environment. This may be accomplished, for example, by adjusting the vapor pressure and excitation pulse width such that the product of this collision frequency and pulse duration is less than 1.On the other hand, this may also be accomplished by maintaining the vaporized uranyl compound in a beam under essentially collisionless conditions. In order to conduct isotoplcally selective dissociation of the molecules of the present invention, and provide molecular fragments bearing the element whose isotopes are to be separated, the initial irradiation step of this invention is thus primarily carried out in accordance with these principles. These same general principles will, of course, also apply to subsequent irradiation steps in accordance with the present invention, such as where two or more irradiation steps are carried out, each of which is intended to isotopically selectively dissociate such molecules and the molecular fragments thereof. Furthermore, these irradiation steps can be carried out by utilizing a pair of lasers such as CO2 lasers or more, each emitting the appropriate infrared radiation, i.e., at the appropriate frequencies, or a single such laser could be employed, in which case that laser could itself be used to deliver infrared radiation at the two or more desired frequencies. In connection with the separation of the isotopes of uranium, a class of UO2 containing molecules which are useful in such a process are those having the formula U02AA Ln, n being either 0 or 1, and A and A being anions whose conjugate acids have boiling points less than about 2000C and PKa values of 4.8 or lower, preferably the same anions, and in which L is a neutral ligand having a boiling point of less than 1900C and an equilibrium constant for its exchange reaction with tetrahydrofuran ranging from about 10 3 to l03. Preferred anions can be either monodentate or polydentate, but will preferably be bidentate, and they will also preferably be monovalent. These will include compounds such as 1,1,1,5,5,5 hexafluoro 2 ,4 pentanedionate CF3COCHCOCF3 1,1,1, trifluoro 2,4 pentanedionate CF3COCHCOCH3 3 trifluoro methyl l,l,l, 5,5,5 hexafluoroacetylacetonate CF3CO 2CCF3 3 trifluor oacetyl 1,1,1,5,5,5 hexafluoro 2,4 pentanedionate CF3CO 3C 3 fluoro 1,1,1,5,5,5 hexafluoroacetylacetonate CF3CO 2CF l,l,1,2,2,3,3,7,7,7 decafluoro 4,6 heptane dionate CF3COCHCOC3F7 l,l,l,2,2,6,6,7,7,7 decafluoro 3, 5 heptanedionate G2F5COCHCOC2F5 , etc. Preferred neutral ligands L include tetrahydrofuran, isopropanol, ethanol, isobutanol, tert butanol, ethylacetate, n propanol, methanol, acetone, dimethylformamide, pyridine, cyclopentanone, dimethylsulfoxide, acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, tetrahydrothiophene, ethyl ether and 1,4 dioxane. Another class of UO2 containing compounds which are useful in this process are those having the general formula U02ALn, where n is from 0 to 5, and A and L are the same as A, A and Ln above. In addition, the UO containing compounds for 2 use in this invention can also have the formula U02AA n where n is greater than one, and preferably from 2 to 4, i.e. such that the dimer compound U02AA 2 is included therein. Furthermore, the neutral ligand L in the above formula UO2AA L will preferably be a base stronger thanTHF toward the uranyl ion, that is, L should have an equilibrium constant for its exchange reaction with the complexed tetrahydrofuran of greater than 1. These compounds thus include such compounds where L is trimethylphosphate TIS , triethylphosphineoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide, dimethylsulfoxide and pyridine. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, UO2 1,1,1,5,5,5 hexafluoro 2,4 pentanedionate 2.tri methylphosphate UO2 hfacac 2.TMP is provided in the vapor phase under static conditions in a suitable cell. The static conditions employed include having the UO2 hfacac 2 TMP present at a partial pressure in the range of from about 0.01 to about 10 torr and at a temperature in the range of from about 80 to 2000C. Of course, the particular pressures and temperatures selected will be dependent upon each other since higher pressures will be produced by the higher temperatures, and the particular conditions employed will be such as to provide this material in the vapor phase, while at the same time attempting to minimize the total thermal energy of each molecule.The pressure ranging of from .01 to 10 torr corresponds to the observed range of saturated vapor pressures of UO2 hfacac 2 TMP in the indicated temperature range. The output beams from two separately grating tunable pulsed CO2 lasers are combined such that spatial overlap is maximized, e.g., by use of the polarization dependent optical properties of a polished single crystal germanium flat intersecting the beams at a small angle near Brewster s angle, or by counterpropagating the beams along the same path. These beams are directed at the sample cell and enter the UO2 hfacac 2sTS P vapor through an infrared transmitting ZnSe window. Pulses from the two lasers are separated in time by an adjustable delay between the instants at which the lasers are triggered. The particular pulse widths of the two lasers used are not critical to the operation of the process, provided that they are comparable to or shorter than the mean collision time between molecules.However, the laser pulse width can be important in determining the appropriate delay. and 238U The UO2 hfacac 2 TNP vapor, containing both 235U isotopes, is irradiated by the first CO2 laser pulse tuned to a frequency in the range 954 4cm 1 to pro duce UO2 hfacac 2 enriched in one of the isotopes of uranium, and free TMP. The degree of enrichment achieved depends upon the frequency chosen. For the temperature range indicated, a large fraction of the UO2 hfacac 2 TMP can be dissociated without seriously compromising the maximum achievable selectivity at a given frequency, but the enrichment decreases rapidly with increasing dissociation yield above 70 . In particular, in Table I, the fractional yields at varying laser pulse energy densities are set forth.The data in Table I is taken at a frequency of 954.56cm 1 for the molecule UO2 hfacac 2 TMP, and shows that a dissociation yield of about 70 in this case is achieved with a laser pulse energy density in the range of about 75 to 85 mJ cm . The energy required for each particular degree of dissociation will, however, also be dependent upon the particular frequency which is chosen. Thus, in Table II, the cross section for excitation from various CO, laser transitions is shown.By employing these factors, in comparison to the data shown for the P 8 transition, the energy fluence required for a certain dissociation fraction in connection with each of these particular frequencies shown in Table II can be readily determined from the requirement that the laser fluence times the absorption cross section is a constant. It is further noted that in the absence of the second laser pulse described below, photodissociation induced by the first laser under these irradiation conditions is reversible. A second laser pulse delayed with respect to the first laser pulse, and in this case tuned to a fre l quency in the range of 967 4cm , is used to irradiate the isotopically enriched UO2 hfacac 2 produced in the first photodissociation step.The reason that the second laser pulse is delayed with respect to the first laser pulse is that the UO2 hfacac 2 is transient in nature and does not form in sufficient quantity for approximately 1 10th of a microsecond after irradiation by the first laser pulse, and on the other hand becomes involved in collisional reactions leading to loss of isotopic selectivity in a time commensurate with the time required for about one to ten collisions. This time varies linearly with the partial pressure of each reactant, including the UO2 hfacac 2 fragment, and will therefore depend not only on the initial pressure, but also on the extent of dissociation resulting from the first laser pulse. Under conditions where the present invention is preferably operated, this time is in the range of from about 0.05 microseconds to 50 microseconds. It should also be noted that since the width of the second laser pulse is only 70 nanoseconds, if it were activated at the same time as the first laser pulse, there would be no U02 hfacac 2 present for it to irradiate. Of course, this process could be performed with two CW lasers, but the photon efficiency of such a process would be substantially lower.At pulse energy densities of at least about 1.5 Joules per square centimeter or greater, the second pulse causes irreversible photochemistry to occur in which the doubly irradiated uranyl species condense and collect on the inner surfaces of the irradiation cell. In our copending European patent application No.based on U.S. application serial No. 106373 there is described a method of separating isotopes of an element, for example uranium, which comprises providing molecules of a compound of the element having an isotopically shifted, but overlapping, infrared absorption spectrum associated with the isotopes of the element which does not change appreciably on absorption of photons. For uranium such molecules can be mixtures of 235U02 and 238U02 containing molecules of UQ2AlA2.L A1 and A2 being monovalent anions, for example CF3C0CHC0CF3, and L a neutral ligand, for example trimethylphosphate.The molecules areirradiated at an infrared absorption frequency to isotopically selectively dissociate said molecules to provide molecular fragments over a time interval, and collecting only those fragments which dissociate within a predetermined portion of the time interval, for example between 0.1 and 10 microseconds after initiation of irradiation. Collection can comprise a second irradiation shifted by upto 100 cm 1 and of pulsewidth less than 5 microseconds.
