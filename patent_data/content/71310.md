# TACHOGENERATOR OUTPUT SIGNAL PROCESSOR

## Abstract
The processor includes a first voltage comparator 4 which responds to a first output voltage level of a tachogenerator 1 to provide a signal A which is present for substantially the whole of every half cycle of one polarity. This signal causes a latch, comprising an AND gate 8 and a clocked D type flip flop 7, to be set to one of its two states by the signal A. A second voltage comparator 5 gives an output signal B in response to a voltage in each half cycle of the other polarity which equals or exceeds half the peak voltage of the tachogenerator concerned when operating at its predetermined minimum peak voltage output. The latch can only be set to its second state by signal B and an output pulse can only be given by the processor whilst the latch is in its second state.
