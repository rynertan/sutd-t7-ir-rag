The cartridge is provided with a lateral arm 14 which guides the rib bon between the container and the typing zone 23 and with a distance piece 25 between the container and the arm 14 which disposes the ribbon above the typing point 17 at a higher level than that of the container in order to allow viewing of the char acters along the typing line. The distance piece 25 comprises deviation surfaces 56, 57 which constitute a friction device for the ribbon emerging from the container.
