# An electroconductive paste to be baked on ceramic bodies to provide capacitors, varistors or the like.

## Abstract
An electroconductive paste consists essentially of 100 parts by weight of zinc in finely divided form, from about 0.01 to 10.00 parts by weight of a glass frit such as, typically, that of PbO B₂O₃ SiO₂ composition, from about 0.01 to 14.99 parts by weight of an organotitanium compound such as tetrakisstearoxytitanium, and a vehicle such as alpha terpineol containing ethylcellulose as an organic binder, for pasting the mixture of the zinc powder, glass frit and organotitanium compound. The paste may contain an addi tive or additives such as the oxides of some metallic elements. By being fired on ceramic bodies at a temperature above the melting point of zinc, the paste forms conductors or electrodes of ceramic capacitors, varistors or the like. The capacitors or varistors having their conductors or electrodes thus prepared from the zinc paste are approximately equiva lent in electrical and mechanical properties to those having their conductors or electrodes fabricated from a convention al silver paste.
