# Counter electrode arrangement of an electrochromic display device.

## Abstract
An electrochromic display device comprises a single counter electrode 2 and a plurality of display electrodes not shown . The counter electrode is charged and is maintained at a given potential by a donor electrode 3 which transfers charge to the counter electrode in response to the action of a reference electrode 4 . A potentiostat 11 operates to supply current to the donor electrode in accordance with the potential of the counter electrode as sensed by the reference electrode. Both the donor electrode and the counter electrode are preferably of platinum black. The donor electrode is preferably arranged in the manner of a frame about the display area. The counter electrode is preferably grid shaped.
