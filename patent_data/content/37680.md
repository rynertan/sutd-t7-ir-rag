# Magneto optic switch.

## Abstract
The invention provides a compact magneto optic switch of reduced loss and reduced liability to cross talk. Light from an input fibre light guide 31 is collimated by a cylindrical rod lens 33 , and diffracted by a magnetic stripe domain Faraday effect grating 43 . After diffraction it is returned through a cylindrical rod lens to output light guides 30, 32 . The grating may be used as a transmission grating with a separate cylindrical rod lens for the input and output sides, but preferably a mirror 46 is placed behind the grating and the light is reflected back through the same cylindrical rod lens 33 as served for the input. Pairs of output light guides may be arranged in a circle about the axis of the cylindrical rod lens, or in two or more concentric circles.
