## Description
This invention relates to a heat shrinkable tubular closure sleeve having a riveted longitudinal seam. Various patents of the prior art discuss numerous contexts in which a wraparound closure sleeve may be used. In U.S.Patent No. 3,379,218 to Conde, use of a closure sleeve is discussed with reference to cables, pipes, and the like. Such sleeves can be used for repair purposes, for purposes of protecting an elongated article from the environment, for purposes of strengthening an enclosed article, or for other purposes. In theConde patent, the sleeve includes a heat recoverable tubular structure all of which is shrinkable. The tubular structure is formed by providing a button and buttonhole longitudinal seam. In U.S. Patent No. 3,574,313 to Tanaka, a heat shrinkable wraparound sleeve is formed from a sheet which includes tabs along one longitudinal edge and complementary slots along the opposite longitudinal edge. In forming the sleeve, the tabs are inserted into the slots and folded to form a longitudinal closure. The disadvantages of both the Conde patent and theTanaka patent are highlighted in U.S. Patent No. 4,268,559 toSmuckler. First, it is therein noted that the buttons and button holes in the Conde patent and the tabs and slots in the Tanaka patent are constructed of the same material as the heat shrinkable portion . Thus, when the sleeve is heated to soften the heat shrinkable portion. . the buttonholes and buttons may soften sufficiently so that the closure might fail. In addition, other problems such as one button unbuttoning while others are being buttoned in the closure device taught in the Conde patent are also discussed. Also cited in the Smuckler patent is U.S. Patent No. 3,455,336 to Ellis. The sleeve disclosed in the Ellis patent includes an elongated metal channel having a C shaped cross longitudinal edges of the sleeve. As the channel is slid along the ridges, successive portions of the ridges are brought together to form a longitudinal closure. Smuckler, in his patent, notes that the channel becor s nDre difficult to slide as the length of the closure increases. Further, it is noted that the channel protrudes radially outward from the sleeve itself, which in various applications might represent a further disadvantage. A discussion is also set forth of a patent to Wilson U.S. PatentNo. 3,530,898 in which closure is effected by passing a metal rod through longitudinally disposed loops. The disadvantages of forming the loops and feeding a rod through the loops are noted as serious disadvantages. The Smuckler patent, in effect, provides a survey of prior technology wherein the heat shrinkable tubular sleeve is provided with some type of longitudinal seam or closure. Specifically, the Sniickler patent recognises the shortconings of the various prior devices which rely on mechanical couplings to longitudinally seam a tubular closure sleeve. After reviewing the various disadvantages of the prior art, theSmuckler patent teaches an adhesive bond to form a longitudinal closure. According to the present invention, there is provided a sheet formable into a substantially tubular sleeve for enclosing a substantially cylindrical object, the sheet evzmprising two longitudinal margin portions and a strip of heat shrinkable material extending therebetween wherein each margin portion has a plurality of holes disposed therein along the length of said margin portion and wherein each of at least some of the holes in one of the margin portions aligns with a matching hole in the other margin portion when the two margin portions overlap in a prescribed rnanner. The invention further provides a substantially tubular closure sleeve adapted to form a wrapping around a cylindrical article, the sleeve oomprising two margin portions extending along the axial direction of the sleeve a one margin portion overlapping the other margin portion b each margin portion having a plurality of holes defined therein along the length of said margin portion and c each of at least some of the holes in one of the margin portions being aligned with a matching hole in the other margin portion a strip of heat shrinkable material extending between the margin portions and a plurality of fasteners, each fastener extending through a pair of matched, aligned holes to couple the two margin portions together. In the preferred enbodiment, a heat shrinkable tubular closure sleeve has a longitudinal seam formed by rivets passing through each of two marginal portions extending longitudinally along opposite sides of a flat sheet used in forming the sleeve. Each marginal portion has holes therealong which can be aligned with holes in the other marginal portion when the two marginal portions overlap each other. Rivets, or other fasteners, pass through the aligned holes to couple the marginal portions together to form a longitudinal seam. The bending and folding required by various prior techniques is obviated by the present invention, as is any difficult requirement of threading a rod through a series of loops or of placing tabs into slots. Hence, it is an object of the invention to provide a mechanical means for longitudinally seaming a heat shrinkable tubular closure that is relatively simple to fabricate and apply. The margin portions may include laminate structures into which the fasteners are placed. The laminate structures do not shrink when heat is applied, unlike the closure devices in the Conde patent and Tanaka patent which teach shrinkable closures. The laminate structures preferably include a metal layer sandwiched between two plastic layers. The invention thus has as another object the eliminating of the problem of a softened closure when heat is applied. The fabrication of the preferred embodiment, it is noted, is particularly facilitated when the sheet, which is formed into the sleeve with the riveted seam, is produced by extrusion. In this way, the laminate structures and a heat shrinkable strip therebetween are easily, inexpensively, and integrally producible The Conde patent, at column 3, line 68, noted that a substantial shearing force is exerted on the buttons and the buttonholes when the sleeve is recovered. The attendant structural requirements imposed on the Conde buttonholes are essentially obviated by the present invention in that the laminate structures of the margin portions do. not recover but remain fixed in dimensions. The laminate structure of one margin portion may overlap the laminate structure of the other marain portion. Specifically, one plastic layer of one laminate structure abuts a plastic layer of the other laminate structure.By forming the plastic layers of a fusible bond plastic, heat applied to either or both of the abutting layers can effectuate a supplemental bond in addition to the rivet coupling. A technique according to the invention will now be explained in more detail, by way of exanqSie, with reference to the acanpanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a top view illustration of a sheet formable into a tubular closure sleeve Figure 2 is a side view illustration of the sheet shown in Figure l taken along line 2 2. Figure 3 is an end view of a tubular closure sleeve longitudinally seamed with longitudinally spaced rivets. Figure 4 is a cross section view of a laminate structur of a margin portion through which rivets are fastened. In Figure 1, a flat sheet 100 is shown. The sheet 100 includes two margin portions 102 and 104. The margin portion 102 has a first plurality of holes 106 extending therethrough, the holes 106 being arranged along the length of the sheet 100. Referring to Figure 2, it is noted that the holes 106 pass through a laminate structure 108 of the margin portion 102.Extending from the laminate structure 108 toward the longitudinal edge 110 is an edge flat 112. Referring to both Figures 1 and 2, holes 114 are shown passing through a laminate structure 116 of a margin portion 118.Extending between the margin portion 102 and the margin portion 118 is a strip 20 of heat shrinkable material. Turning again to Figure 2, it is noted that the laminar structures 108 and 116 are basically similar in form. Accordingly, both will be discussed with reference to laminate structure 108. The laminate structure 108 includes a layer of metal 130 sandwiched between two layers of plastic 132 and 134. Preferably, the plastic of at least layer 132 of laminate structure 108 and layer 136 of laminate structure 116 are heat fusible. The plastic of the layers 132 through 138 may be either unoriented heat shrinkable or not heat shrinkable material. In the former case, fabrication is facilitated where the sheet 100 is formed by extrusion. That is, the heat shrinkable strip 120 and the two margin portions 102 and 118 are simultaneously extruded with a thin, maleable metal ribbon being intro duced into the margin portions 102 and 118 to form the laminate structures 108 and 116, respectively. The metal may be almost any metal, such as aluminum, capable of being extruded into thin ribbons. Preferably the meta is coated with an acrylate polymer film to enhance bonding to the plastic. A metal acrylate coated tape that may be used in this context is the commercially available Dow Zeta Bond tape. The plastic is preferably a polyolefin as is known in the art. After the sheet 100 is formed, preferably by extrusion, the strip 120 is irradiated and oriented. This orienting will have a component of stretch transverse to the length of the sheet 120. Preferably, the stretch is orthogonal to the length of the sheet 120. With this type of stretching, the sheet 100 when formed as a tubular sleeve will shrink to reduce the radius of the sleeve. It is to be noted that the margin portions 102 and 118 are not irradiated or oriented and, hence, do not shrink with the application of heat. Because of the metal layer 130 inserted between layers 132 and 134, shrinking is further prevented. After art After the irradiation and orienting, the holes 106 and 114 are drilled or punched, the diameter of the holes 106 and 114 corresponding to the size of hand applied rivets see Figure 3 or such other fasteners which pass through two aligned holes. Referring now to Figure 3, the sheet 100 is shown wrapped around an article 200 which is elongated and may be cylindrical in shape. The article 200 may be a circular cylinde or may have a square or other multi sided or other closed curve cross section. The sheet 100 is shaped so that holes 106 in the laminate structure 108 align with holes 114 in the laminate strut ture 116. A rivet 202 is applied through the aligned holes. Pre ferably, the aligned holes are opposite each other, like holes 106a and 114 a. Also preferably, each hole 106 is matched in size and shape and aligned with a corresponding hole 114. After the rivets 202 are applied, heat is applied to the longitudinally seamed tubular sleeve 204. The strip 120 shrinks to reduce the radius of the sleeve 204. As the sleeve 204 tightens around the article 200, the seam remains closed and does not soften. The laminate structures 108 and 116 are, at this time, abutting each other, the layer 132 of laminate structure 108 bein positioned radially inward relative to the abutting layer 136 of the laminate structure 116. By making the layers 132 and 136 heat fusible, one can provide heater wires 208 and 210 which can connect to the metal layers 130 and 140, respectively, or to the.plastic layers 132 and 136 r or both. By directing current into the wires 208 and 210 heat is transferred to the abutting plastic layers 132 and 136 which then fuse or bond together. In Figure 4, the laminate structure 108 is shown enlarged. The layers 132 and 134 may be 40 mums. thick while the layer 130 may be 20 mms. thick. The wire 208 is, preferably, a nichrome wire and may be imbedded in the plastic layers directly if desired. Depending on the heat generated by the wire 208, the wire 210 may not be required.
