# Process for preparing ZnSe single crystal.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a large ZnSe single crystal, com prising vacuum sealing polycrystalline ZnSe prepared by a chemical vapor deposition in a capsule and hot isostatic pres sing polycrystalline ZnSe in the capsule, by which the ZnSe single crystal having such high qualities as to be used as a substrate on which the epitaxial layer of ZnSe is grown is prepared.
