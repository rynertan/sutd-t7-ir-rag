# Dump packing element.

## Abstract
A dump packing element having a large specific surface area to fractional voids volume exhibiting particular perform ance characteristics in operations involving fluid fluid con tact. Specifically, when placed in a fluid fluid contact appar atus, the dump packing provides a relatively large number of equivalent theoretical stages per unit height of packed bed at a low pressure drop over each theoretical stage. A preferred packing element comprises a perforated curved base mem ber 1 , comprising curved flat base strips 10 having free ends and flanges 13 , and carrying a bridging member 2 with two bridged strips 11 oppositely curved from the base strip 10 . The strips are deformed by a strengthening ridge 12 .
