# MACHINE FOR MANUFACTURING FOAM BUILDING BLOCKS

## Abstract
A machine for manufacturing foam building blocks 39 and the like wherein a plurality of two piece forming molds 21 are continuously moved by a conveyor mechanism along a closed path of travel 22 is disclosed. Filling, curing and injection stations 31, 32 and 33 are located along the path of travel 22 . As a mold 21 enters the filling station 31 , the nozzle 37 of a foam gun 35 enters a hole 34 in the top of the mold 21 and moves with the mold 21 as that mold con tinues to move along the path of travel 22 . At the end of the filling station 31 , after the foam gun 35 has injected a suitable amount of resin, curing and foaming agent materials into the mold 21 , the nozzle 37 rises from the hole 34 . Thereafter, a cap latch 36 is moved into a hole closed posi tion, in addition to closing the hole 34 , the cap latch 36 forms one of two latches that latch the two mold pieces 21a and 21b together. The other latch 38 is located on the oppo site side of the forming molds 21 . After leaving the filling station 31 , the forming molds pass through the curing sta tion 32 where they are heated to a suitable temperature. After leaving the curing station 32 , the forming molds 21 enter the ejection station 33 where the latches 36, 38 are opened, the forming mold pieces 21a and 21b are split apart and the finished foam block 39 is ejected. Then, the forming mold pieces 21a and 21b are brought back together and the latch 38 is closed. Thereafter, the forming molds 21 are moved to the filling station 31 and the cycle is repeated.
