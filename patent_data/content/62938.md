# Low calorie spread based on a low melting butterfat fraction.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a low calorie spread based on a low melting butterfat fraction, which has an improved spreadability at 10 C as compared with low calorie butter. The low melting butterfat fraction is an olein preferably obtained by dry fractionation of butterfat within the tempera ture range of 20 30 C.
