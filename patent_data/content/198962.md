A medical instrument having a path for receiving a bar like member and a combination of valves 16, 17 provided in the path. The combination of valves 16, 17 comprises a first disc like valve 16 having a first slit 18 open only to one of the end faces thereof and a second slit 19 open only to the other of the end faces thereof, the first and second slits 18, 19 crossing each other to form a distance of intersection inside the first valve 16 , and a second disc like valve 17 disposed in parallel to the first valve 16 and having a slit 21 opening to both end faces thereof. The slit 21 of the second valve 17 crosses the intersection point of the first valve 16 so that the bar like member passes through the slit 21 of the second valve 17 as well as the intersection of the first valve 16 when it is inserted.
