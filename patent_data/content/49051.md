The preventing means comprises a mouth member 39 which is fixed to the cylinder 32 at an entrance 37 of a keyhole but capable of being broken off from the cylinder 32 and becoming rotatable with respect to the cylinder 32 while being undetachable. Preferably the mouth member 39 has a hardness greater than that of the cylinder.
