# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying apparatus comprises a sup port mechanism 18 attached to an upper housing sec tion 14 for supporting a photosensitive drum 20 to allow the drum to be rotated and detached, and at least one peripheral device provided within the upper housing section, put in contact with the drum during copying ope ration and moved away from the drum to allow the drum to be detached from the support mechanism. The upper housing section is swung open to allow the drum to be taken from it. The copying apparatus further comprises a detect switch 54 attached to a housing 16 and closed by a specific operation necessary for taking out the drum from the housing and a lamp 52 provided within the housing for illuminating the outer periphery of the drum and turned on when the detect switch is closed.
