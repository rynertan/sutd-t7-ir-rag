# THERMAL CRACKERS FOR FORMING PNICTIDE FILMS IN HIGH VACUUM PROCESSES

## Abstract
An apparatus for forming an evaporated pnictide contain ing film on a substrate characterised in that it comprises a cracker adjacent to the substrate is disclosed. A process for the production of an evaporated pnictide containing film on a substrate characterised in that it com prises deposition thereof using a cracker is also disclosed. Referring to the accompanying illustrative drawing, the present apparatus may comprise a cracker 34 adjacent to a substrate 28. The present invention represents an advance over the prior art.
