## Description
CIRCUIT NETWORK CHECKING SYSTEMThis invention relates to circuit network checking systems, particularly for determining the integrity of circuit networks extending between monolithic circuit chips and or modules. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved circuit network integrity checking system which determines that the voltages on a circuit network fall within a predetermined circuit operating range.In the IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Volume 22,No. 8B, January 1980, on pages 3679 and 3680, there is shown and described a circuit checking arrangement in which signals on control lines are used to set checking latches. This arrangement does not contemplate detecting departures from predetermined marginal voltage limit on the control lines. However, it has been found advantageous to know these departures from predetermined voltage limits in order to better control and determine chip module integrity.It is accordingly a principal object of this invention to provide circuit network checking system for interconnections between monolithic circuit chips, which system detects departures from predetermined voltage ranges on the connection.This invention provides a novel circuit checking arrangement particularly useful in connection with integrated circuit technology. The integrity of circuits extending from one chip to another, or among modules comprising several chips is of ever increasing importance. Integrity of circuitry contained on a single chip is usually assured by quality control of manufacturing of the semiconductor circuitry per se. It accordingly becomes in creasingly important to check the proper operations of the chip to chip, or module to module connections. In the preferred mode of the present invention, the voltage on the connection network is compared with a reference voltage. If the network voltage is not within a predetermined set of limits, an error signal is generated.With the advent of large scale integration LSI it is now economically feasible to provide such a checking arrangement for each connecting line to a chip.An embodiment of the invention is described below in connection with the appended drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a voltage level diagram which illustrates the relationship of possible voltage levels on a signal line.Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an interconnecting circuit network between two chips and is illustrative of a preferred embodiment of the invention.Fig. 3 is a detailed circuit diagram of one comparator circuit which can be used in the arrangement shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram showing a plurality of interconnections between chips, each intercon nection having a network checking circuit associated therewith.In semiconductor circuits, particular circuit families will have certain values of voltage which are considered to represent a logic value of 1 and other values of voltage which are considered to represent a logic value of 0 . As shown in Fig. 1, a logic 1 is defined as a voltage between the least positive up level 3 and the most positive up level 5. Any voltage in the region higher than level 5 is considered to be in an invalid region 7. Similarly, the valid voltage range for a logic 0 is defined as lying between a least negative down level 9 and a most negative down level 11. Any voltage excursion lower or more negative than level 11 is considered to be in an invalid region 13. When a break or open circuit occurs in the circuit connections, the circuit net will float to a technology specific voltage level, at the receiving end.Such breaks can occur in wire connections, printed circuit connections, solder connections, etc. In any case, the voltage will enter an invalid area such as regions 7 or 13 as shown in Fig. 1. The examples shown assume a ground down logic circuit technology. The invention pertains equally well to ground up technologies.A circuit network of the type involved is shown inFig. 2, in which a driver 15 has associated therewith a pull down resistor 17, both being located on a first chip 19. The driver drives an interconnecting line 21 which extends to a second chip 23. A terminator network 25 may be attached to the line 21. Line 21 is connected to an input terminal 27 of a receiver 29 located on chip 23. Also connected to terminal 27 is a receiver pull down resistor 31.A network checking circuit 33 is connected to terminal 27 via a terminal 35. A reference voltage source 37 is also connected to the checking circuit 33 via a terminal 39. Error signal outputs from the checking circuit are supplied, when they occur, to terminals 41 and 43, as a result of the voltage at terminal 7 entering one of the invalid regions of Fig. 1. The details of an appropriate checking circuit 33 are shown in Fig. 3. Input terminal 35 is connected to the base of a first transistor T1, the emitter of which is connected to the emitter of a second transistor T2 and via a resistor R2 to a negative voltage source V1. The base of transistor T2 is connected to the reference voltage source 37 via terminal 39.The collectors of transistors T1 and T2 are connected to ground via resistors R1 and R3 respectively, and are also connected via lines 45 and 47 to the bases of transistors T3 and T4. The emitters of T3 and T4 are connected together and to a negative voltage source V2, and the collectors of T3 and T4 are connected to ground via resistors R4 and R5 respectively. Output terminals 41 and 43 are also connected to the collectors of transistors T3 and T4, respectiveiy. In operation, if the voltage at terminal 27 increases positively to a value in the invalid region, it will exceed the reference voltage level turning on transistor T1 which will in turn turn off transistor T3, causing an error output signal to appear at terminal 41. The arrangement as shown is for a float up check. For a float down check, the lines 45 and 47 should be interchanged at one end thereof.For optimum operation, resistor R2 should be as large as possible and resistor R1 should be as small as possible, to provide a high input impedance and a small linear region for the comparator. The reference voltage source 37 can be any temperature stabilized source.Source 37 and checking circuit 33 are located, of course, on the same chips as receiver 29. Fig. 4 shows a plurality of interconnections 21a, 21b and 21c between two circuit chips. Driver 15a, 15b and 15c supply signals to their associated lines, which signals are received by the associated receivers 29a, 29b and 29c. The integrity of the connections is checked by the network check circuits 33a, 33b and 33c. Fig. 4 also illustrates how the error output signals from the check circuits can be combined, as by an OR circuit 51, to provide a single error output line 53 which will have an output thereon if any interconnection to the chip fails. Also, the error output signals may be used to set associated latches such as latches 55a, 55b and 55c, to preserve an indication of an improper voltage excursion. This system provides improved detection of defects or errors on any type of electrical signal line control, data, or other improved fault isolation, a savings in circuitry as compared with parity checking, residue checking, etc., and a savings in the number of input and output connections on the associated chips or modules.
