# Apparatus for detecting a security thread embedded in a paper like material.

## Abstract
An apparatus for optically detecting a security thread 2 embedded in a paper like material 1 , e.g., a paper currency P . The paper like material 1 is carried through a detection region defined by an infrared radiation source 3 and two infrared radiation detectors 6 7 . Two optical filters 4, 5 are mounted on the detectors 6 7 , respectively. Those filters 4 5 have different infrared transmission characteristics. Therefore, one detector 6 can detect infrared rays having wavelengths only within a specific range determined by that one filter 4 , and the other detector 7 can detect infrared rays having wavelengths only within another specific range determined by the other filter 5 . When the infrared radiation source 3 projects infrared rays to the paper like material 1 , the detectors 6 7 deliver the respective detection signals. A discriminator 10 processes these detection signals to discriminate wherether or not a securiry thread 2 is embedded in the paper like material 1 and also what a detected security material 1 is made of.
