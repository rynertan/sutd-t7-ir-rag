## Description
The present invention relates to a combination of processors that have a uniform transmission processing function, and more specifically to a combined computer system that is constituted in a one dimensional to three dimensional manner. Network systems for connecting a plurality of processors computers have heretofore been either a bus structure, a loop structure, a star structure, or a mesh structure. The first three of these structures can not be constructed in a three dimensional configuration. In a mesh structure in which processors are connected through bidirectional transmission lines, routing is complex. In a star structure, the processor at the center of the structure is different from the other processors. In a mesh structure, a particular processor must work to cope with any change in the structure of the system or with any abnormal condition that may occur, thereby making it difficult to expand and maintain the system. US A 4 380 061 describes a computer system as defined in the preamble of Claim 1. To preclude the defects inherent in the conventional art, the present invention provides a computer system of high transmission capacity and speed even if a malfunction in a transmission line occurs. Fig. 1 is a diagram of constituent units according to the present invention, Figs. 2 to 13 are diagrams showing a plurality of processors that are connected in the form of networks according to the present invention, and Fig. 14 is a diagram of a data processing and controlling unit according to the present invention. Fig. 1 shows three kinds of constituent elements a , b and c that will be combined in the form of building blocks to constitute a system. The constituent unit consists of a processor and unidirectional transmission lines for transmitting the data therefrom to other processors. Transmission lines of neighboring processors are connected to the unidirectional transmission lines so as to form pairs and so as to receive the data therefrom. Diagrams a , b and c of Fig. 1 illustrate constituent units that consist of processors 10, 20 and 30, and two, three and four transmission lines 101, 102 , 201, 202, 203 , and 301, 302, 303, 304 , respectively. To the transmission lines 101, 102, 201, 202, 203, 301, 302, 303 and 304 are connected transmission lines 10k, 10ℓ, 20k, 20ℓ, 20m, 30k, 30ℓ, 30m and 30n of the neighboring processors to form pairs. Figs. 2 to 13 show transmission lines of the processors forming pairs, that are connected successively. The constituent units are all the same, hence, each of the transmission lines constitutes a portion of a closed loop transmission line. Here, the constituent unit may have any number of unidirectional transmission lines in addition to the above mentioned numbers. Figs. 2 to 5 illustrate examples of connecting the constituent units that have two unidirectional transmission lines. Namely, Fig. 2 illustrates an example in which the processors are divided into two groups consisting of 10, 11, 12 and 13, 14, 15 which are coupled through a loop 101, 111, 121 and a loop 131, 151, 141 . The processors 10, 13 , 11, 14 and 12, 15 on these different loops are coupled via a loop 102, 132 , a loop 112, 142 and a loop 122, 152 . Fig. 3 shows an example in which all of the processors are coupled through the same loops. Fig. 4 illustrates an example in which the processors are divided into three groups 10b, 11b, 12b, 13b , 14b, 15b, 16b, 17b and 18b, 19b, 20b, 21b which are coupled in the form of loops. Unlike the example of Fig. 2, however, processors 10b, 11b , 12b, 13b , 18b, 19b and 20b, 21b on the same loops are coupled. In this regard, the example of Fig. 4 resembles the example of Fig. 3. However, other processors 14b, 15b, 16b, 17b are connected to constitute loops that traverse the above mentioned three loops 101b to 131b , 141b to 151b and 181b to 211b . In this regard, the example of Fig. 4 is the same as the connection method of Fig. 2. Fig. 5 shows an example in which processors are divided into three groups 10c, 11c, 12c, 13c, 14c, 15c , 16c, 17c, 18c, 19c, 20c, 21c and 22c, 23c, 24c, 25c, 26c, 27c which are coupled in the form of loops. Unlike the example of Fig. 4, however, the processors 11c, 14c and the processors 23c, 26c exist on the loops 101c to 121c , 221c to 231c and are not adjacent to each other. In the arrangement of Fig. 2, if the system is to be expanded without changing the constitution of the double loop consisting of a loop 101, 111, 121 and a loop 131, 151, 141 , it is necessary to increment the number of processors by one for each of these loops. Hence, it is necessary to increase the number of processors by two. If it is based on loops 102, 131 , 112, 142 and 122, 152 , the processors can be incremented by one for each of the loops. That is, the processors can be increased by a total of three. In the arrangement of Fig. 3 based upon a double loop structure, the processors can be incremented by a unit of one. Based upon the same idea as that of Fig. 2, the processors in the arrangement of Fig. 4 can be increased by a unit of six or by a unit of four. In the arrangement of Fig. 5, in the same manner, the processors can be increased by a unit of six processors. Increase in the number of processors changes the structure of system. Therefore, the number of processors to be increased may change thereafter. Figs. 6 to 10 illustrate methods for connecting constituent units that have three unidirectional transmission lines. In Fig. 6, the three processors 20, 21 and 22 are connected by loops 202, 212 , 211, 221 , 203, 223 that connect between the two processors, and by loops 201, 213, 222 of single processors. In Fig. 7, the four processors are connected by triple loops. Fig. 8 shows an example in which a processor is added to the structure of Fig. 6. Fig. 9 shows an example in which three processors are added to the structure of Fig. 6. Fig. 10 illustrates an example in which three processors are added to the structure of Fig. 9. In the structures of Figs. 7 to 10, the processors can be incremented by any integer greater than one. Figs. 11 to 13 illustrate methods of connecting constituent units that have four unidirectional transmission lines. Fig. 11 shows an example in which nine processors are arranged in a two dimensional manner, Fig. 12 shows an example in which three processors are arranged in a one dimensional configuration, and Fig. 13 shows an example in which 32 processors are arranged in a three dimensional configuration. Fig. 13 is an expansion of the structure of Fig. 11. Fig. 14 shows the internal structure of the constituent units 10, 20 and 30. Responsive to the numbers 2, 3, 4 of unidirectional transmission lines of the constituent units 10, 20 and 30, however, there exist two, three or four interfaces connected to the loop transmission lines. The processor consists of a terminal 3000 and a data processing and controlling unit 300 which controls the transmission or reception of information relative to the loop transmission lines. The terminal 3000 consists of a terminal device 3005 and interfaces 3001 to 3004 between the terminal device and the data processing and controlling unit. Here, the four interfaces 3001 to 3004 make connection with different data processing and controlling units, and may be provided in any number greater than one. Described below is a process in which data generated from the terminal device 3005 is transmitted to a predetermined terminal via a loop transmission line. Data generated from the terminal device 3005 is sent to data processing and controlling units via interfaces 3001 to 3004. Data sent from the terminal device via an interface 322 is then stored in a sending buffer 317. Data is provided with an address receiving address of a terminal where the data will be received or a code content code corresponding to the content of the data. In a routine table 323 has been written a program which determines in which loop direction the data should be transmitted corresponding to the address or the content code. The program has been written onto the routine table 323 prior to sending the data. When data exists in the sending buffer 317, the operational unit 315 sends that data from any one of the interfaces 311 to 314 relying upon the routine table 323. If the data thus sent returns after having circulated through the loop, the operational unit 315 judges that the data is properly transmitted, and erases the data from the sending buffer 317. Here, the data that is to be sent is provided with an address of the interface that sends the data. The address of the interface has been stored beforehand in the ROM of interface address table 321. When data arrives flowing on the loop, the data processing and controlling unit 300 introduces the data through, for example, an interface 311, reads the address of the interface 311 from the interface address table 321, attaches the interface address, and stores the data in a receiving buffer 316. If the data received is not the data that is generated from the data processing and controlling unit 300, the data is then sent through the interface 311 that has received the data. If the data is the data that is generated from the data processing and controlling unit 300, that data is erased from the receiving buffer 316 and from the sending buffer 317 as mentioned above. As the data is taken into the receiving buffer 316, the operational unit 315 transfers the data to the terminal via the interface 322 provided the receiving address or the content code of the data is in agreement with that of a receiving function code table and address 320. Next, if the receiving address or the content code of the data is in agreement with that in the routine table 323, said data is sent in the direction of the transmission loop written thereon through interfaces 311 to 314 of directions other than the loop direction in which the data is received. When the data is sent to the terminal and to the loop direction, the data is erased from the receiving buffer 316. When the data in the sending buffer 317 and the data in the receiving buffer 316 are to be sent for the first time, each on its own loop, the data processing and controlling unit sets the timer 318 for each of the data. If the data does not return even after a predetermined period of time has passed, the data processing and controlling unit sets the flag of an abnormal status register 319 corresponding to the loop into which the data is sent. As the flag is set in the abnormal status register 319, the operational unit 315 broadcasts the abnormal condition on the loop in all directions via the interfaces 311 to 314. Upon receipt of the data which reports the abnormal condition, the data processing and controlling units broadcast the abnormal condition to the loop directions in which the data reporting the abnormal condition has not yet been received. The processor which has received the data that reports the abnormal condition converts the routine table 323 corresponding to the abnormal loop. For instance, a by pass route may have been determined to cope with the abnormal condition that may take place in the loops, or if an abnormal condition develops somewhere, the data may be broadcast in all loop directions thereafter. In the receiving function code table and address 320 has been stored in advance a content code or an address of the data required by the terminal device 3005 that is connected to the data processing and controlling unit 300. According to the system of the present invention, the defective portion may be separated to be checked. In this case, transmission of data is continued through other portions. Further, since the constituent units are all the same, maintenance can be easily carried out. According to the present invention as described above, identical constituent units are successively connected to each other to form a plurality of looped structures. By changing the method of connection, a communication network can be constituted that can be easily changed into a one dimensional, two dimensional or three dimensional structure. Further since it is based upon a looped network, transmission routing can be easily accomplished. Moreover, all of the constituent units have the same hardware and software, and no apparatus having particular functions such as a master apparatus is needed, thereby offering an advantage in regard to maintenance.
