# Hydraulic jack device.

## Abstract
A hydraulic jack 10 comprises a base 11 having a vertically disposed cylindrical member 12 attached thereto. A cylindrical movable member 13 is mounted on the fixed member 12 and is vertically movable relative thereto. The base 11 is provided with passages 28 and 29 therethrough which communicate with a source of fluid under pressure, such as a reservoir and pump. The fixed and movable members 12 and 13 define a pair of variable chambers 21 and 22 , each of which is connected in communicating relation with one of the passages by restricted orifice 30 or 31 to reduce the flow of fluid to and from the chambers. When one of the chambers 21 is pressurized, the movable member 13 is raised and will support a load engaged thereby. When the other chamber 22 is pressurized, the movable member 13 is lowered. Fluid in the chambers 21 and 22 is prevented from returning to the reservoir by valve elements 36 and 47 . A valve actuator 27 is operated by fluid pressure and selectively opens each passage to permit the return of fluid to the reservoir. Relief valves 56 and 61 permit the escape of fluid from each chamber 21 and 22 when a predetermined pressure is exceeded because of thermal expansion, or excess load.
