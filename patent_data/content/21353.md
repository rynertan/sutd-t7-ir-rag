# Air conditioner control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A vehicle air conditioner control method and apparatus for automatically controlling the air conditioning of the compartment of a vehicle in accordance with a predetermined automatic control pattern, uses selector 15, 22, 23 for selecting a desired air conditioning condition. In response to the command signal from the selector, changeover from the control parameters, such as, air flow rate and supply air temperature for an automatic control mode to the selected control parameters for a selected air conditioning mode is effected, thus making it possible to selectively control the air conditioning of the vehicle compartment in accordance with a predetermined automatic control mode and a selected air conditioning mode.
