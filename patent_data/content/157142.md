# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY HAVING MEANS FOR EMI SHIELDING

## Abstract
A continuous 360 electrically conductive seal about the back shell 30 of an electrically conductive connector shell 20 having teeth extending aftwardly from its end face 34 and around the braid shield 46 of a coaxial type cable 40 connected to the back shell by an accessory boot 50 protects signal carrying conductors from EMl entry and the surrounding area from EMI leakage. A frusto conical wall including an electrically conductive annular wall portion such as provided by the inner wall 100 of an accessory ferrule 56 , or of an electrically conductive annular cap 68, 78, 86 mounted in the ferrule is interference fit about the toothed end face of the connector shell so as to overlap and completely encircle the back shell at a point inwardly of the valleys 36 of the teeth.
