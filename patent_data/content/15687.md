# Measurements of free ligands.

## Abstract
A method for the measurement of the concentration of a free ligand in a liquid sample also containing the ligand bound to endogenous binding material includes the steps of incubat ing the liquid sample with an amount of an immobilised binding agent such that an amount of the free ligand related to the initial concentration of free ligand becomes bound to the immobi lised binding agent, and estimating with the aid of a labelled reagent the amount to the ligand bound to the immobilised binding agent and hence the initial concentration of free ligand, using as a means of calibration the results obtained under the same procedure using standard solutions containing known fi nal concentrations of the free ligand. The measurement of the free ligand concentration can be carried out by a direct or indi rect method and standard solutions free from endogenous binding material can be used for direct or indirect calibration to provide a method which does not eventually rely for standardi sation on another method of determining such a concentration in standard samples containing endogenous binding material. The method is of particular value for measuring free thyroid hormone concentration using immobilised antibody specific to thyroid hormone.
