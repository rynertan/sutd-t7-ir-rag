## Description
TITLE OF INVENTIONComposition for therapeutic or diagnostic use and a process for therapeutic treatment. The present invention relates to compositions which can be used for therapeutic treatment of infections cause by disease generating microorganisms, such as bacteria, particularly intestinal bacteria, such as Gram negative types. The invention is particularly applicable to bacteria of the genus Enterobacteriaceae such as Esoherichia coli bacteria, particularly K88 .The compositions according to the invention can also be used for prophylactic and diagnostic processes. The invention also relates to a process for therapeutic treatment of mammals including man. Although the invention is not limited in such a way it will in the following be illustrated essentially in connection to the bacterium E.coli. Bacterial infection courses are often initiated by the fact that the bacterium has the ability to adhere to epithelial tissue. This adhering capacity is specific in that different bacteria adhere preferentially to different types of tissues. Thus, studies have shown that the bacterium E.coli possessing fimbriae pili designated K antigen K88 adheres well to intestinal epithelium of piglets Ref. 1 . It has also been shown that the K88 fimbriae are responsible to the ability ofE.coli K88 to agglutinate guineapig erythrocytes Ref. 2 .The mutant lacking K88 fimbriae lacks ability to adhere to intestinal epithelium with the result that said E.coli bacteria cannot colonize the intestinals of pigs Ref. 3 . It has, moreover, been shown that theK88 fimbriae recognize some structure on the brush border membranes of the intestinal epithelium. Thus, it has been shown that certain pigs lack this structure in the intestinal epithelium and that this fact results in said pigs being resistant to intestinal infections caused by E.coli K88 . The present invention has for an object to provide a substance or composition having the ability of replacing the normal receptor in vivo in relation to pathogenic bacteria prone to provide infections in man and animals. Another object of the invention is to provide such composition or substance, which, in addition to the therapeutic use, can be used also diagnostically. A further object of the invention is to provide a process for identification andjor quantification of the receptor structure of biological materials from mammals including man. The invention also relates to a process for purification of bacteria or acceptor structures of bacteria and process for carrying out disinfection. The invention is particularly directed to the receptor structure of K88 fimbriated E.coli but is not limited to this type of bacterium. In connection with studies and experiments leading to the present invention it has been found that the receptor for K88 fimbriated E.coli found on the surface of epithelial cells and erythrocytes contains a structural element having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R and RX are same or different and are hydrogen or an organic residue, for example lower alkyl, lower acyl or a carbohydrate residue, or an inorganic residue, such as sulphate or phosphate, and wherein OR1 is in a or B configuration. In this structural formula R2, R and R4 are preferably all hydrogen. Alternatively, R2 may be an a D Galp residue or an a D Galp l a D Galp residue. In structural formula I R1 may further be attached in either a or ss configuration and R1 can be of an arbitrary type as long as it does not adversely effect the circumstances in connection to the use of the invention. In formula I R1 may be a group having the formula EMI3.1 Alternatively, R1 may be a group having the formula EMI3.2 wherein n is an integer from 1 100. The above structural element having the above formula is preferably positioned in terminal position, i.e. with the left end of the formula in freely exposed condition. However, the structural element may be substituted with other sugar residues or organic or inorganic residues as long as they do not negatively effect the state of things in connection to the use of the composition. The other preferred structural elements are clear from the appended patent claims. The invention also relates to a process for therapeutic treatment of mammals including man, an active amount of a composition in accordance with the invention being administered to the mammal. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a composition which can be used for identification and or quantification of the said receptor structure in biological material or to purify bacteria or their acceptor structures. The composition contains one or several structural elements according to the invention covalently or otherwise linked to for example a macromolecular carrier, optionally via a coupling arm. Useful carriers may be synthetic or naturally occurring polypeptides, polysaccharides or other types of polymers or particles. When present the coupling arm between structural element and macromolecular carrier may be any of the following structural elementEMI4.1 macromolecular carrier structural elementEMI4.2 macromolecular carrier structural elementEMI4.3 macromolecular carrier structural elementEMI4.4 macromolecular carrier structural element NH CH2 nCONHmacromolecular carrier structural element NH macromolecular carrier In the above examples n may vary between 1 and 15. It should be observed that the invention is not limited to the specific coupling arms disclosed above, and the skilled artisan immediately realizes obvious modifications of those disclosed above. The techniques for linking oligosaccharides of the type used herein to macromolecular carriers, optionally via a coupling arm, is conventional in the art, see for example References 6 10. The haemagglutination reaction of guineapig erythrocytes caused by K88 fimbriated E.coli is due to interaction between K88 fimbriae on the surface of the bacterium and receptors on the surface of the erythrocytes containing the above mentioned structural c c.ent. The adherence of K88 fimbriated E.coli to brsh border membranes is due to interaction between Kd8 fimbriae on the surface of the bacterium and the rev .tors on the surface of the membranes containing the above mentioned structural elements. The active constituents according to the present invention may, in a conventional manner, be formulated for use in human or veterinary medicine for therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic purposes. The composition or the pharmaceutical preparation may contain the active constituents in combination with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which may be solid, semi solid or liquid depending on the manner of administration and other factual circumstances. The active constituents may also be used as such without addition of carrier materials. The compositions are prepared in full conformity with conventional pharmaceutical practice. Suitable forms of the compositions of this invention include tablets, capsules, syrups, suspensions, solutions, concentrates, reconstitutable powders in sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion.Such compositions may contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable materials, such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives, disintegrants and the like in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in the manner well understood by those skilled in the art of formulating antibiotics. According to a preferred aspect of the present invention the present compositions are used for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes to treat or prevent diarrhoeae in pigs, particularly piglets. For therapeutic purposes the active structure is administered suitably dissolved in the drinking water of the animal, and in particularly severe cases it can be administered through oral gavage. For prophylactic purposes the active structure may be added directly to the animal s diet, either per se or as a concentrate in aqueous solution or other suitable formulation, for example together with a diluent to facilitate dosage. Suitable quantities can be determined on a case to case basis and may be of the order of grams per day, for example from 0.1 to 50 g day. The active constituents specifically mentioned in the following disclosure are known as such and can be prepared in accordance with conventional and known processes. However, the substances have not previously been stated to possess properties making them medicinally useful. The invention will in the following be further described by non limiting examples.Example 1.Inhibition of haemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes with E.coli K88 or K88 fimbriae pili by addition of oligosaccharides. In the tests bacteria of the type E.coli 0 149K88 were used. The bacteria were cultivated on CFA medium at 370C for 18 hours. The bacterial growth was slurried in PBS, pH 7.2 to a density of 1 x 1010 bacteria ml. K88 fimbriae were obtained in the following manner The bacterial strain was cultivated on Roux flasks with CFA agar. After incubation at 570 for 24 hours the bacteria were harvested by adding 10 ml PBS flask and sterile glass balls. The flasks were shaken and the bacterial suspension removed. The bacteria were pelletized by centrifugation 3000 x g, 40, 0 min. . l he supernatant was removed by suction. The bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml PBS and the suspension was treated in a Waring blencor 2 x 20 seconds. The suspension was centrifuged 5000 x g, 40, 30 min. to pelletize the bacteria. The supernatant containing fimbriae was removed by suction. The bacterial pellet is resuspended, treated in a Waring blendor and after centrifugation the supernatant is again recovered. The two supernatants are pooled and ammonium sulphate is added to a concentration of 50 . After stirring the supernatants are allowed to stand at 40r for 18 hours, centrifugation then taking place at 5000 x g. The supernatant was separated and the precipitation was dialyzed against PBS.The solubilized fimbriae fraction was precipitated with ammonium sulphate once more and dialyzed. Haemagglutination is performed using erythrocytes from guineapigs GRBC suspended to a concentration of 3 v w in PBS. The agglutination tests were carried out so that 50 1 GRBC were mixed with 2 step dilution of antigen 50 l bacterial suspension or 50 jil fimbriae suspension and 50 l PBS in microtitre plates. The plates were sealed with Parafilm and incubated at 44 0C for 4 hours and were then recorded. The last well wherein agglutination could be read by the eye is considered as 1 haemagglutinating unit 1 HU . In the inhibition experiments there were added instead of PBS 50 l of an oligosaceharide solution, the inhibiting capacity was studied. The oligosaccharide was tested from the concentration 200 ug 50 l by 2 step dilution. In the tests there were used concentrations of bacteria and fimbriae which by 3 GRBC results in 2 4HU. The results are presented in Table 1.Table 1. Inhibition of haemagglutination between GRBC anA w88 fimbriated bacteria or K88 fimbriae.

The oligosaccharide was purified by gel chromatography and paper chromatography. Example 2Preparation of oliffosaccharides from GRBC inhibiting haemagglutination of GRBC with K88 fimbriated bacteria or K88 fimbriae. For the purpose of investigating whether the active constituent tested in Example 1 had counterpart in erythrocyte tissue the following experiments were performed. Erythrocytes from guinea .pig blood are lysed and the membranes are isolated by means of centrifugation Ref. 4 . From 1 liter of blood there were obtained 12 grams of membranes. To 10 grams of lyophilized membranes trifluoroacetic acid anhydride 200 ml and trifluoroacetic acid 200 ml are added, and the reaction mixture is heated at 1000C in a tube of acid resistant, stainless steel at an overpressure of about 4 atms. for a period of time of 48 hours. After this treatment the reaction mixture was cooled and evaporated into dryness, a dark residue being obtained. Methanol 500 ml is added to the residue and after 30 minutes evaporation into dryness is performed. The residue is then diluted with 50 ffi aqueous solution of acetic acid 500 ml and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand in room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is then filtered and evaporated into dryness. The residue obtained is distributed between water and diethyl ether. The ether phase is washed with water 4 times and the combined aqueous phases are washed with diethyl ether 4 times. The aqueous phase obtained contains the released oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharide mixture was reduced with an excess of sodiumborohydride in water and N acetylated.The oligosaccharide mixture obtained was fractionated on a Sephadex G 25 column in three different fractions.Fraction III containing mono and disaccharides andFraction II containing trisaccharides mainly the carbohydrate part of asialo GM2 did not show any inhibiting ability on the haemagglutination system GRBC och K88 fimbriae. Fraction I containing oligosaccharides larger than trisaccharides showed inhibiting ability, and chemical analysis showed that this fraction contained inter alia structural elements of the type a D Galp 1 3 D Gal and o D Galp l 3 c D Galp l 3 D Gal. Example 5 Preparation of oligosaccharides from pig intestine inhibiting haemagglutination of GRBC with K88 fimbriated bacteria are K88 fimbriae. Small intestine from pig was homogenized and washed with acetone, the acetone washed material obtained being dried in air. Air dried material 500 g was extracted with absolute ethanol 10 1 , 80 ethanol in water 10 1 and 60 ethanol in water 10 1 . The extracts were combined and evaporated into dryness. Trifluoroacetic acid anhydride 2 1 and trifluoroacetic acid 2 1 were added to the residue, and the reaction mixture was heated at 1000C in a tube of stainless steel at an over pressure of about 4 atms. for 48 hours. After this period the reaction mixture was worked up according to the description of Example 2. The worked up reaction mixture containing oligosaccharides was fractionated on a Sephadex G 25 column, the mixture being divided up into three fractions I IV. FractionsI III contained mono to tetra saccharides andFraction IV pentasaccharides and larger oligosaccharides.Only fraction IV showed inhibiting ability on haemagglutination of GRBC and K88 bacteria and K88 fimbriae, respectively. Chemical analyses of fraction IV showed that the fraction contained oligosaccharides having the structural elements a D Galp 1 3 D Galp and a D Galp 1 3 a D Galp 1 3 D Gal. Example 4Inhibition of adherence of K88 fimbriae to brush border membranes from pig small intestine by addition of oligosaccharides. In the experiments I125 labelled K88 fimbriae at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml in PBS were used. Moreover, brush border membranes prepared according to Sellwood et al at a concentration of 2 . 106 cells ml in PBS were used. Oligosaccharides tested for their inhibiting ability were dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 5 mg ml. In the inhibition tests 0.5 ml 125 labelled K88 fimbriae was incubated with 0.5 ml oligosaccharide solution at 37 C for 30 minutes, 1 ml of the suspension of brush border membranes being then added. After incubation for another 60 minutes at 370C the mixture was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 600 x g, the radioactivity being then measured in the supernatant. As a control 1 ml of PBS was used. In these experiments it could be shown that a D Galp l 3 D Gal, e D Galp l 3 o D Galp l 3 D Gal and a D Galp 1 3 a D Galp 1 3 a D Galp 1 3 D Gal inhibited the adherence of K88 rmbriae to the brush border membranes to 70 , 79 and 73 , respectively, whereas a D Galp 1 4 D Gal and a D Galp l 6 D Gal were inactive.Example 5Preparation of compositions containing the structural element in at least bivalent state and covalently linked to a macromolecular carrier. The composition was prepared starting from oligosaccharides having a free reducing end.

A glycolipid containing the said structural element is attached by a hydrophobic interaction to lipophilic hydrophobic gels, polymers or particles, for example octyl sepharose, plastics and latex surfaces.Example 7Preparation of antibodies having specificity towards the said structural element.a. Preparation of monoclonal antibodies by hybridoma technique.I. Balb c mice were immunized with a composition according to the invention. The spleen from hyperimmunized animal is harvested and a cell suspension is prepared by mechanical comminution of the tissue. After gradient centrifugation to obtain a pure cell preparation the cells are fused by means of polyethylene glycol PEG average molecular weight 1500 with establishedB myeloma cell lines from Balb c mice according to known technique. After cloning of the hybridoma cells generating the antibody desired, the cells are propagated on a large scale, the culture medium supernatants being harvested and the antibodies are being purified in a conventional manner. For identifying antibody generating clones there is used so called enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA Ref. 5 .II.

In a parallel experiment bacteria are incubated with guinea pig erythrocytes GRBC together with the structural element according to the invention at such concentration that haemagglutination is completely inhibited. Haemagglutination and inhibition of haemagglutination is performed in accordance with Example 1. Positive haemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes GRBC and complete inhibition of haemagglutination after addition of oligosaccharide verifies the fact that the bacteria possess acceptor ucture. Bacteria are incubated with a composition wherein tile structural element in question is covalently or through other association in multivalent form linked to particular matrix according to Example 5 or 6. In cation is performed on microscope slides for 10 15 rrjiltes the preparation being then studies in microscope. If the bacteria possess acceptor structure the particles are covered with bacteria.
