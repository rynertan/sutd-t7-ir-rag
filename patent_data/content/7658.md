# Hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide and a process for the production of acrylamide polymers.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for the hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide comprising contacting the acrylonitrile with water at a temperature between 50 C and 175 C in the presence of a heterogeneous nitrile hydration catalyst. The total oxazole content of the acrylonitrile and water is less than 200 parts per million based on the weight of the acrylonitrile. The acrylamide monomer is employed to produce acrylamide polymers.
