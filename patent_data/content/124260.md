# POWER SUPPLY LINE CARRIER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A transmitter receiver unit for use in a two way electrical power supply line carrier communication system. The unit includes two conductors 3, 5 for connection to the supply line, and a transmitter 1 and a receiver 7 each connected across the two conductors. A first winding 9 of a transformer is connected in series between the transmitter 1 and receiver 7 on one of the conductors 3 . Switching means 13, 15, 21 is provided which is operable to control the impedance across a second winding 11 of the transformer so that the first winding 9 presents a relatively high impedance to carrier signals when the receiver 7 is operating, and a relatively low impedance to carrier signals when the transmitter is operating.
