# METHOD OF TREATING PRESBYOPIA WITH CONCENTRIC BIFOCAL CONTACT LENSES

## Abstract
Presbyopia is successfully alleviated in a person having binocular vision by a method wherein a concentric bifocal contact lens having a central distant vision zone and a peripheral near vision zone is fitted to one eye of the person and a second concentric bifocal contact lens having a central near vision zone and a peripheral distant vision is fitted to the other eye. The invention also comprises a kit containing a pair of concentric contact lenses, one lens having a central vision zone adapted to correct distant vision and a peripheral vision zone adapted to correct near vision, and the other of said lenses having a central vision zone adapted to correct near vision and a peripheral vision zone adapted to correct distant vision.
