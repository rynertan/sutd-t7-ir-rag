## Description
DESCRIPTION THE METHOD FOR FIXING FOOD INGREDIENTS ON A MAGNESIUM SALT SUBSTRATETECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to the use of magnesium salts for fixing various food ingredients including flavors, colors, juice solids, vegetable solids, spices and hygroscopic sugars. According to the present invention fixing or fixation refers to the entrapment and or encapsulation of the food ingredient within a magnesium salt substrate in such a manner that volatile ingredients such as volatile flavorants will be retained within the substrate and non volatile ingredients which are subject to oxidation and or moisture pickup, such as natural juice solids, are protected against ambient atmospheric conditions. There are numerous methods in existence to fix various food ingredients, such as volatile flavors, in edible substrates. Materials such as dextrins and hydrophilic colloids e.g., gum arabic, gelatin, etc. have been commonly used as these substrates.PRIOR ART The prior art contains many examples of fixing food ingredients such as volatile flavorants in a substrate and examples of producing dry juice solids. U.S. Patent No. 3,554,768 to Feldman discloses forming a solution of a carbohydrate and the volatile flavorant acetaldehyde and then drying this solution such as by spray drying. U.S. Patent No. 3,061,444 to Rogers et al.discloses the fixation of all or a portion of a natural juice in a combination of water soluble cyclic and acyclic dextrins by forming a solution of these materials and then drying the solution. U.S. Patent No. 2,567,038, issued to Stevens et al. discloses a method for drying fruit juices that includes the following steps buffering or partly neutralizing the pH of a juice with calcium carbonate or sodium citrate pasteurizing the buffered juice concentrating the juice to about 75 to 90 solids improving the stability of the juice by adding ascorbic acid adding the concentrated juice to granular sugar and drying the product by a vacuum dryer or by means of an air dryer. U.S. Patent No. 4,112,130, issued to Gupta reveals a method for spray drying a citrus juice comprising a providing an aqueous slurry including up to about 65 solids, about 50 85 of the solids being orange juice solids with the balance consisting essentially of maltodextrin and b concurrently spray drying said slurry to a powder having an average moisture content of less than about 4 in a spray dried apparatus.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a process for fixing various food ingredients such as flavors, colors, vegetable juice solids, fruit juice solids, spices, hygroscopic carbohydrates e.g., sugars, high D.E. dextrins, etc. and the like, to the products produced from this fixation process and to food compositions containing the fixed food ingredients of this invention. The present invention will have utility to fix any food ingredient which is either water soluble, water dispersible or water emulsifiable.According to this invention, these materials are fixed in a substrate which is comprised of and preferably consists essentially of the magnesium salts of edible monobasic, dibasic and or tribasic acids. Suitable monobasic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid and lactic acid. Suitable dibasic acids are adipic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid. Suitable tribasic acids are phophoric acid and citric acid. The material fixed in the magnesium salt will be both substantially retained in the salt and substantially protected from the effects of ambient moisture and or oxygen. The fixation process is accomplished by mixing an aqueous solution of the magnesium salt and the ingredient or ingredients to be fixed and then drying the mixture. The mixture may be dried by any conventional drying technique such as freeze drying, spray drying or drum drying.In order to maximize efficiency of fixation, the more volatile the ingredient to be fixed, the lower the temperature should be during drying. The magnesium salt present in the solution can result from either the direct addition of a magnesium salt or the addition of a basic magnesium compound e.g., MgfOH 2, MgO, etc. to an acid containing solution such as a fruit juice, or by a combination of either of these routes. The sequence in which the various materials are added to form a mixture of the magnesium salt solution and the food ingredient or ingredients to be fixed is not critical to this invention. The prime requisite is that immediately before drying the aqueous liquid contain magnesium cation and acid anion and an ingredient which is sought to be fixed. The amount of magnesium present should be such that, for each mole of acid contained in the solution, there should be from at least 0.3 moles of magnesium present in solution. It is speculated that the dried magnesium salt is the material which forms the fixation substrate, in which event from about 0.4 to 1.5 moles, typically about 0.5 to 0.8 moles of magnesium will be present in the solution for each mole of acid present in the solution. The level of magnesium in the dry magnesium salt substrate will be from about 4 to 30 by weight. The amount of food ingredients which may be fixed according to the process of this invention can be up to 9 parts by weight for each part by weight of added magnesium salt. This invention is highly suited for the fixation of natural juice constituents.These constituents may comprise all or part of a particular juice, may be volatile or not and may be of varying molecular structures. Because of the relatively high fix levels which can be obtained and the inherent low calorie, non carbohydrate nature of the magnesium salt substrate, the fixed food ingredients of this invention are ideally suited for use in or as low calorie food products. Unlike prior art processes which rely on added carbohydrates for fixation, this process is accomplished without the addition of caloric carbohydrates. This invention has been established to provide fixation for edible solids, for volatile flavors and flavor enhancers such as those compounds naturally found in fruits, spices and vegetables, for colorant such as the color imparting agents or compounds naturally found in juices or extracts and for hygro scopic carbohydrate solids such as those contained in high fructose corn syrups. As will be recognised by those skilled in the art, the fixation cf csmpJeii mixtures such as natural juice solids will inherer include the fixation of flavors, colors, proteins and carbohydrates at one time. The particular edible juices or extracts which may be fixed in accordance with this invention include those of leaves, vegetables, roots, spices, fruits, meat and the like. In place of whole natl r juice there may be used a more volatile portion or portions thereof, such as vacuum or steam aromas cur water or oil extracts. Volatile flavors such as those found in orange water aroma, orange oil aroimcl and orange peel aroma are readily fixed by means of this invention. The synethically produced counterparts of any of the volatile fractions of natural flavors e.g., acetaldehyde may also be fixed. The use of sodium, potassium or calcium salts of organic or inorganic acids have not been found to be suitable as fixation substrates. Thus magnesium salts appear to be unique among the metal salts as fixatives. It is further surprising that successful fixation can be performed with as little as 10 by weight of the magnesium substrate. EXAMPLE 1 A magnesium citrate solution was prepared by combining 12.2 pounds 5.53 kgs of citric acid monohydrate obtained from Pfizer, Inc., New York,New York and 7.6 pounds 3.45 kgs of magnesium hydroxide U.S.P. obtained from Mallinckrodt, Inc., Paris, Kentucky and 96.1 pounds 43.59 kgs of water at ambient temperature. To this solution was added 146 pounds 66.22 kgs of 58.20 Brix orange juice concentrate obtained from Sunkist Growers,Ontario, California . Orange juice typically has a citric acid content of from 5 to 20 , solids basis.The mixture was then spray dried using a cocurrent stream of air having an inlet temperature of 3800F 193.30C and an outlet temperature of 2100F 98.9C resulting in a dry free flowing yellow powder containing about 15 by weight added magnesium citrate carrier and about 85 juice solids. The dry powder was readily soluble in cold water at least up to a 10 level providing all the flavor characteristics of orange juice. The powder was also useful as an ingredient in an orange flavored powdered soft drink mix at a level of from 1 to 60 by weight as a source of natural orange flavor, color and solids. EXAMPLE 2 An aqueous magnesium hydroxide suspension was formed by combining 13.16 pounds 5.97 kgs of magnesium hydroxide in 76 pounds 34.47 kgsj of water at ambient temperature. To this suspension was added 193.75 pounds 87.88 kgs of 51.60 Brix lemon juice concentrate obtained from SunkistGrowers . This lemon juice had a citric acid content of about 60 by weight, solids basis. The solution was dried as in Example 1 producing a dry, free flow ing, bone white powder containing about 95 juice solids and about 5 magnesium.The solution contained about G.7 moles of wagnesiwz for ea h .., zid and the level of magnesium found in the magnesium salt substrate was about 8.5 by weight. The dry powder was readily soluble in cold water at least up to a 10 level providing all the flavor characteristics of lemon juice. The powder was useful as an ingredient in an lemon flavored powdered soft drink mix at a level of from 1 to 70 as a source of natural lemon flavor, color and solids EXAMPLE 3 An aqueous magnesium citrate solution was prepared by combining 90 grams of magnesium citrate Mg3 C6H507 2 H2O obtained from B.D.H. Chemcial Ltd., Poole, England and 900 grams of water. To this solution was added 840 grams of 250Brix tomato paste obtained from Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc., Fullerton, California . The mixture was blended to uniformity and then spray dried using a cross flow stream of air having an inlet temperature of 1500C and an outlet temperature of 900C. A dry, freeflowing, orange red tomato powder was obtained having the natural color and flavor characteristics of tomato. The dry powder was readily soluble in water at least up to a 5 level. The dry powder was comprised of 70 tomato solids and 30 magnesium citrate carrier. This powder is a suitable ingredient for use in a dry salad dressing mix at levels of from 5 to 25 by weight.
