# Substituted oxo piperazinyl triazines and UV light stabilized compositions.

## Abstract
A particular branched chain polyalkylenepolyamine PAPA having plural amine groups including a secondary amine group intermediate terminal free primary amine groups that is, neither one is hindered , and having at least two C atoms between each group, may be selectively cyclized with a ketoform reaction to form a polysubstituted pipe razinone PSP , with specific directivity. Such PSPs are linked to a triazine nucleus to yield piperazinone triazine PIP T compounds which are excellent stabilizers for poly olefins and other light degradable polymers. Certain acyclic polyalkylenepolyamines may have a PIP T substituent at each N atom forming pendant PIP Ts P PIP T for brevity which are also excellent stabilizers, and like some of the PIP Ts, some P PIP T s provide photostabilization without noticeably interfering with the color of films and fibers provided by even pastel colored pigments and dyes.
