# ADJUSTABLE SICKLE GUARD ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An adjustable sickle guard assembly includes upper and lower guard members mounted to the frame of a cutting implement, with each guard member having at least one forwardly directed guard time. The upper and lower guard members each include complementary, facing recessed portions into which a laterally displaceable sickle bar is positioned. A horizontal slot is also provided between the upper and lower guard members immediately forward of the recessed portion within which a reciprocating sickle section mounted to the sickle bar is confined. The upper lateral edges of the lower guard tine form cutting surfaces with the reciprocating sickle section. The upper guard member is pivotally mounted to the cutting implement frame in an adjustable manner and is capable of controlling the displace ment between the sickle section and the lower guard tine. Thus, the cutting action between the sickle section and the lower guard member may be adusted to compensate for various operating conditions including cutting edge wear. In another embodiment, the reciprocating sickle section is confined within a pair of parallel, laterally aligned slots between adjacent upper and lower guard members formed from a single work piece. The upper and lower guard members are coupled at a forward portion of the sickle guard assembly and form a single, integrated forward extending guard tine. An adjustable hold down assembly pivotally mounted to the cutting implement s frame abuts an upper surface of the sickle section permitting the cutting action between it and the lower guard members to be adjusted as the cutting edges wear.
