# A transformer.

## Abstract
A transformer has a number of single turn primary wind ings 5 formed by printed circuit tracks on a flexible bendable sheet 3 which is wrapped around a core of the transformer. The primary windings are connected to output terminals 12 of an enclosure 1 of the transformer by another printed circuit board 8 having further conductive tracks on opposite sides thereof to form balanced transmission lines whose impedance is matched to the impedance of the primary windings.
