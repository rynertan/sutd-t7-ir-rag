# Apparatus for inserting electrical terminals into an electrical connector housing.

## Abstract
A terminal 4 secured to an end of a wire 6 is supported with the terminal 4 in alignment with, and facing, a cavity in a connector housing 10 on a jig 12 . A lid 24 is then closed to confine the wire 6 in one end of a tunnel defined by a channel 36 in the lid 24 and a wire support surface, the other end of the tunnel being proximate to the housing 10 . Wire feed wheels 22 and 23 , both of which are driven wheels, are then raised to drive the wire 6 down the tunnel so that the terminal 4 is inserted into the cavity.
