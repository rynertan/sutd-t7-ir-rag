# Method and device for controlling an electrophotographic apparatus provided with a photoconductive belt having a seam.

## Abstract
Electrophotographic apparatus, provided with an endless photoconductive belt 1 having a seam 42 , said belt 1 being taken past a number of processing stations, including a charging 23 and a developing station 25 , in order to form an image on said belt 1 . An image formed is transferred onto receiving material in a transfer station. A check is made for each image to be formed to determine whether the seam 42 is situated inside the belt section intended for forming that image. If the seam 42 is situated inside that belt section no receiving material is fed to the transfer station and that belt section is discharged before that section reaches the developing station 25 .
