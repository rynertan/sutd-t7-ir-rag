## Description
This invention relates to load lifting apparatus comprising an extensible boom carrying load bearing means at an outer end and being pivotally mounted at an inner end for movements of elevation and depression to raise and lower, respectively, the load bearing means, the boom being pivotally mounted at its inner end on support structure of the apparatus and the apparatus comprising a hydraulically actuated elevating ram arranged to act between the support structure and the boom to raise and lower the boom and a hydraulically actuated extending ram to extend and retract the boom, control means of the apparatus comprising monitoring means which is arranged to monitor the overturning moment of the boom and to prevent such operation of the two rams as would cause a safe overturning moment to be exceeded. Engine size in a self propelled lifting platform is largely determined by the overall weight of the machine and the required road performance. To keep fuel costs down, engine size should not be greater than necessary. In order to reduce the required engine size for a certain road performance, or in order to achieve an improvement in road performance for a given engine size, it is desirable that the overall weight of the machine be minimised. It can further be desirable to reduce engine size in order more nearly to match power requirements for the two conditions of operation of a self propelled lifting platform, i.e. when operating as a vehicle and stationary when operating as an access platform by doing this the engine can at all times be run at a power level which prevents the engine running cold for long periods and, therefore, allows it to run more efficiently. Reducing the overall weight of the machine can also have considerable advantages with regard to transportability to sites. However, a reduction in weight of the machine base i.e. including the engine and chassis, and those parts of the machine supporting the boom results in a reduction in stability of the machine. More specifically, the maximum overturning moment which can safely be accepted on the machine base, from a loaded boom in use, becomes reduced. The overturning moment applied to the machine base depends fundamentally on the load applied at the outer end of the boom i.e. on the platform and the horizontal outreach of the boom a reduction in the overturning moment can be achieved by reducing the load and or the outreach. The outreach varies, of course, with the elevation of the boom. In the case of an extensible boom machine, the outreach is determined not only by the boom elevation but also by the amount the boom is extended. Accordingly, if the safely acceptable overturning moment is reduced, by reducing the weight of the machine base, one has to a reduce the safe working load, or b reduce the boom length or maximum permissible boom extension which reduces the maximum outreach, and also reduces the available working height , or c make provision for monitoring the overturning moment in use of the machine, in order that whilst the safe working load and boom length or maximum boom extension remain unchanged, and can both be employed at higher boom elevations, the acceptable overturning moment is not exceeded at lower elevations. Such monitoring has been effected, in one known arrangement, utilising a resiliently supported pivot arm interposed between the boom and an elevating ram reacting against support structure of the machine base. That is to say, the pivot arm transmits load from the ram to the boom through a sprung connection. By means of a microswitch on the boom, operated by deflection of the pivot arm, control circuitry of the machine can be signalled electrically upon the load on the sprung connection exceeding a predetermined value, so to prevent further increase in the overturning moment by lowering or extension of the boom. There are various weaknesses in the known system of that kind. In particular, whilst the angular relationship between the ram and the boom varies very little in most lifting platform designs , the moment arm of the ram varies considerably as the boom is raised or lowered. Thus for a constant overturning moment of the boom and payload, measured about the boom s pivotal connection with the support structure, the ram load varies considerably with changing boom elevation. This variation in ram load at different elevations of the boom is not compensated for by the sprung connection mounted on the boom. Thus the limiting overturning moment allowed for by the sprung connection will be different for different boom elevations. Additionally, the use of an electrical microswitch for signalling the machine to stop lowering or extending the boom has the disadvantage that it provides a sharp on off signal, which can be inappropriate in view of the inertia of the large moving parts being controlled. Other known systems, such as to be found in FR A 2 522 638, for monitoring overturning moment use pressure in the elevating ram as a basis. This has the same geometrically imposed weakness as above and in addition is unreliable due to friction in the ram causing a significant proportion of the induced pressure. The is described in FR A 2 184 108 a load lifting apparatus having overturning moment monitoring means which is an improvement over such known systems as hereinbefore referred to. In this proposal a solenoid is used to monitor the overturning moment. If a pre set limit is exceeded the solenoid is deactivated shutting off the hydraulic flow. The load lifting apparatus of FR A 2 184 108 comprises an extensible boom carrying load bearing means at an outer end and being pivotally mounted at an inner end for movements of elevation and depression to raise and lower, respectively, the load bearing means, the boom being pivotally mounted at its inner end on support structure of the apparatus and the apparatus comprising a hydraulically actuated elevating ram arranged to act between the support structure and the boom to raise and lower the boom and a hydraulically actuated extending ram to extend and retract the boom, control means of the apparatus comprising monitoring means which is arranged to monitor the overturning moment of the boom and to prevent such operation of the ram as would cause a safe overturning moment to be exceeded, the monitoring means comprising a pivot arm to which a turning moment is applied by the elevating ram in supporting the boom and switching means arranged to be actuated upon a predetermined turning moment being exceeded as a consequence of deflection of the pivot arm against a resilient supporting means. The present invention is characterised in that said switching means comprises a first diverter valve which if the boom is being lowered diverts part at least of the ram actuating fluid from the elevating ram to the extending ram to urge retraction of the boom, and a second diverter valve which if the boom is being extended diverts part at least of the ram actuating fluid from the extending ram to inhibit extension of the boom. Preferably the two diverter valves are arranged to operate progressively as the overturning moment increases to increase the proportion of fluid diverted until the first valve is arranged to divert the whole the ram actuating fluid from the elevating ram to extending ram and the second valve is arranged to divert the whole of the ram actuating fluid from the extending ram. Preferably the elevating ram is pivotally coupled to the pivot arm substantially within the plane of the pivot axes of the pivot arm and the boom whereby the variation of the boom elevation the load on the resilient supporting means remains substantially constant for a constant overturning moment of the boom. Preferably the pivot arm engages height adjustable means of the resilient supporting means whereby the position of the pivotal coupling of the ram to the pivot arm in normal use of the apparatus can be adjusted relative to the plane of the pivot axes of the pivot arm and the boom. The resilient supporting means is preferably such that it can be pre loaded to determine the minimum pivot arm turning moment at which deflection of the arm will occur. Conveniently, it can comprise a pre loadable spring pack comprising a setting bolt engaged by the pivot arm and providing the height adjustable means referred to in the last preceding paragraph. In a preferred arrangement the ram is coupled to the pivot arm at a position between the pivot axes of the pivot arm and the boom, the spring pack being secured to the support structure at a position generally between the pivot axes of the pivot arm and the boom for engagement by the arm at a distance from the pivotal coupling of the ram to the arm. There now follows a detailed description, to be read with reference to the accompanying drawings, of a lifting platform apparatus which illustrates the invention by way of example. In the accompanying drawings Lifting platform apparatus Figures 1A and 1B comprises a telescopically extensible boom B which at an outer end carries load bearing means in the form of an operator s platform P. The boom is pivotally mounted at an inner end on support structure 10 comprising what is commonly known as an A frame or superstructure , for movements of elevation and depression to raise and lower, respectively, the operator s platform. The support structure is swivel mounted, for rotation about a vertical axis, on a self propelled wheeled chassis C. Such lifting platform apparatus, as so far described, is of a conventional kind. With reference to Figures 2 and 3, the support structure 10 of the illustrative lifting platform apparatus is arranged at horizontal bearing points 12 to support pivotally the inner end of the boom B. A double acting, hydraulic, elevating ram 14 see also Figure 1B is arranged to act between the support structure 10 and the boom to raise and lower the boom. The ram 14 is coupled to the boom by means of an outer end pivotal coupling 16. By means of an inner end pivotal coupling 18, the opposite end of the ram is connected to and between parallel side plates 19 of a pivot arm 20 which is itself pivotally mounted on the support structure at horizontal bearing points 22. The pivotal coupling 18 of the ram 14 to the pivot arm 20 lies between the pivot axes of the pivot arm and the boom at the bearing points 22 and 12 respectively and can be adjusted to lie in the plane of those axes. A levelling cylinder 21 is connected between the support structure 10 and the boom to act as a master cylinder operating a slave cylinder which levels the operator s platform in a known manner . The pivot arm 20, through which the elevating ram 14 acts upon the support structure 10, forms part of monitoring means arranged to perceive the overturning moment of the loaded boom in use of the machine. The monitoring means comprises also a valves and spring pack assembly 24 see also Figure 4 which is bolted to the support structure 10, at a position generally between the bearing points 22 and 12 of the pivot arm and the boom, adjacent to an outer end portion of the pivot arm 20 at a distance from the pivotal coupling 18 of the ram 14 to the arm. A turning moment applied to the arm by the load on the elevating ram 14 is resisted by means of a spring pack 26 of the assembly 24 against which the outer end portion of the arm bears the arm actually bears against the head of a height adjustable setting bolt 28 of the pack 26. The spring pack is pre loaded in order that in normal operation of the machine the spring pack will not be deflected. However, should the overturning moment exceed a predetermined value, for example as the boom is lowered to one side of the machine, the pivot arm 20 will be deflected resiliently, resisted by the spring pack 26. The valves and spring pack assembly 24 comprises also first and second hydraulic diverter valves 30 and 32, the precise function of which will be described hereinafter. The valves are arranged next to the spring pack 24 on a common mounting plate 34 to be actuated by the outer end portion of the pivot arm 20 when the arm is deflected to a predetermined degree the arm is arranged to engage height adjustable setting bolts 36 and 38 of the valves. The valves form part of switching means of the monitoring means operative as hereinafter described to limit and ultimately prevent such further movements of the operator s platform as would increase the overturning moment. The two diverter valves are of the same construction, as illustrated in the case of the first valve 30 by Figure 5. Each valve comprises a reciprocable spool 40 whch in an extreme right hand position as shown in Figure 5 permits a flow of hydraulic fluid under pressure from an inlet port 42 to a first outlet port 44 only, in an extreme left hand position permits flow from the inlet port 42 to a second outlet port 46 only, and in intermediate positions permits and proportions flow between the inlet port and both of the outlet ports. The spool is biased to its extreme right hand position by means of a compression coil spring 48 acting against its left hand end. The setting bolt 36, arranged to be engaged and depressed by the pivot arm 20, is secured in one end of a piston 50 arranged coaxially with the spool 40 to the right of the spool. A headed shoulder bolt 52 is secured in the opposite end of the piston 50. A peripherally flanged sleeve 54 is engaged beneath the head of the bolt 52 and a second compression coil spring 56 of the valve is maintained in compression between the flange of the sleeve 54 and a washer 58 abutting a leftwardly facing shoulder of the piston 50. The assembly of the piston 50, the bolt 52, the sleeve 54, the spring 56 and the washer 58 is arranged to abut the right hand end of the spool 40. Upon the piston 50 being urged leftwards, by the pivot arm 20 acting on the setting bolt 36, the spool 40 is urged leftwards by the sleeve 54. The first spring 48 is overcome without further compression of the second spring, owing to the pre loading of the second spring 56, and the spool is moved leftwards. In order to damp out transient loadings on the piston, the spool 40 is arranged at its left hand end to engage a damping unit 60 the unit 60 so permits leftwards movement of the spool, progressively to close the first outlet port 44 and open the second outlet port 46, only in the event of a sustained load being exerted on the piston 50. As constructed, the load necessary to move the spool 40 leftwards is applied by the sleeve 54, from the piston 50, by means of the second spring 56. Transient loadings can be absorbed by compression of that spring. Should the spring fail, in operation, the piston 50 can drive the shoulder bolt 52 through the sleeve 54 to engage the spool 40 directly. Hydraulic circuitry associated with the monitoring means will now be described with reference to Figure 6. The two diverter valves 30 and 32 are indicated on the drawing, as are the elevating ram 14 and a double acting, hydraulic, extending ram 62 of the apparatus arranged to extend and retract the boom in a conventional manner. It is to be observed from Figure 6 that in the case of the second diverter valve 32 one of its two outlet ports 44 is plugged. The apparatus comprises three control valves for operation from the operator s platform the valves are a boom elevation control valve 64, a boom extension control valve 66, and a slewing control valve 68 by means of which rotation of the support structure by a slewing motor 70 can be controlled. With the valves 30 and 32 undepressed in normal operation of the machine as shown in Figure 6 the operator can cause the boom to be lowered by depressing the elevation control valve 64 from the neutral position illustrated in Figure 6 fluid under pressure from a rotary distributor 72 passes to the inlet port 42 of the first diverter valve 30 and out through the first outlet port 44 to the annulus side of the elevating ram 14 to cause the boom to be lowered. Conversely, the boom is caused to be raised upon the elevation control valve 64 being raised from its neutral position. The operator can cause the boom to be extended by depressing the extension control valve 66 from the neutral position illustrated fluid under pressure passes directly to the cylinder side of the extending ram 62 to cause the boom to be extended. Conversely, the boom is caused to be retracted upon the extension control valve 66 being raised from its neutral position. In the event that the overturning moment becomes excessive during lowering or extending of the boom, the pivot arm 20 actuates the two diverter valves 30 and 32 the two being actuated simultaneously . The valve spools 40 become moved to their intermediate positions in which fluid is distributed to both outlet ports 44 and 46 . In the case of the first valve 30 the effect of this is that the flow of fluid passing to the annulus side of the elevating ram 14 to lower the boom becomes reduced, an increasing part of the fluid flow being diverted to the second outlet port 46 as the valve becomes further depressed. As can be seen from Figure 6, the second port 46 is connected to the annulus side of the boom extending ram 62, pressure on which side acts to retract the boom. In the case of the second diverter valve 32, the effect is to bleed to tank fluid from the pressure supply line to the cylinder side of the extending cylinder 62 to the inlet port 42 of the diverter valve 32 is connected to that pressure supply line and the unplugged outlet port 46 is connected to tank. Accordingly, in this intermediate condition of the diverter valves, any attempt to lower the boom will meet with a reducing boom lowering performance should the overturning moment continue to increase and an increasing tendency for the boom to be retracted. Any attempt to extend the boom in the normal way will similarly meet with a reducing boom extending performance, until the stage is reached where the boom may be retracted owing to diverted fluid flow through the first diverter valve 30. Should the situation not be corrected by the operator, to prevent a further increase in the overturning moment, the diverter valves 30 and 32 will become fully depressed by the pivot arm 20. In that condition of the first diverter valve 30, the first outlet port 44 of the valve is shut off by the spool 40, so preventing any further lowering of the boom. Furthermore, any attempt to lower the boom will result in retraction of the boom, owing to diversion of the full fluid flow to the second outlet port 46 connected to the annulus side of the extending ram 62. Any attempt to extend the boom will be ineffective since the pressure line to the extending ram 62 is then fully open to tank by way of the unplugged outlet port 46 of the second diverter valve 32. An important aspect of the interaction of the elevating ram 14 with the pivot arm 20 on the support structure 10 is that the load on the spring pack 26 is substantially constant given a constant overturning moment on the boom about the bearing points 12 that is, irrespective of the degree of boom elevation . This is due to the geometrical arrangement of the ram, boom and pivot arm within the support structure, and is illustrated by Figure 7. A constant overturning moment of the boom about the bearing points 12 results in different ram loads at different boom angles. However, by centring the inner end pivotal coupling 18 of the elevating ram 14 on the line joining the centres of the boom and pivot arm bearing points 12 and 22 the torque applied to the pivot arm 20, and so the load applied to the spring pack 26, can be made independent of the boom and ram inclination. It can be seen that with suitable adjustment of the setting bolts 28, 36 and 38 the triangles comprising sides a, b, c, and x, y, z are similar, and remain so for all inclinations of the ram and boom. For a torque T The torque then induced in the arm measured about its pivot is given by Now spring pack load, L and as already stated That is to say, the load on the spring pack is directly proportional to the overturning moment of the boom and independent of boom elevation.
