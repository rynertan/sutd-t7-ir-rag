# Prefabricated silo for agricultural employ.

## Abstract
The silo has a cylindrical form with variable height and diameter, and is carried out in prefabricated A.V.C. sectors. In the lower part, a discharging cell is foreseen with an upper separation slab and central hole for positioning a rotating cutter to extract the ensiled product from below. On a massive foundation 2 , the discharging cell is made by means of a set of prefabricated sectors 1a and a cutter bearing slab is superposed by previous mounting of another set of sectors which form a ring for the casting containment. The silo cell is obtained by composition in vertical succession of annulars consisting of two or three sectors connected one to another by means of steel boltings. The joints between the annulars 1c and the sectors are sealed with waterproof material 4 . For completion, the covering slab in three components is set up. The medium permits quick laying times, variable sizes, a high reliability since prefabricated components made in the factory are em ployed, a consistent installation saving, the possibility of disassembling the silo at very low costs and of reassem bling it on another place without damaging the components.

## Description
Prefabricated silo for agricultural employ.The invention refers to a silo for a particular employ to preserve cereal forage such as cut fine graned maze or other cereals, to be carried out by mounting A.V.C. elements prefabricated in the facto ry. At present, silos are carried out on the spot performing the conventional building operations which involve high production costs, long carrying out times, the necessity of maintenance and leading to unremovable constructions.In comparison of all that, the invention permits the solution of many problems it allows the silo moun ting in short times that can be estimated in four or five days many different sizes since modular elements are employed for hori zontal a nd vertical composition, a high reliability as elements pre fabricated in the factory are used, a considerable plant saving both during the carrying out phase and for maintenance. To all that the possibility has to be added that the silo can be disassembled with a very low expense, to be reassembled on another spot without any dama ge for the components. This is possible because the composing sectors are set up with the only interposition of waterproof material and as sembled by means of steel bolting.The silo is laid on a massive cylindrical foundation in A.V.C. into the ground to be carried out on the spot and to rate each time according to the geotechnical features of the ground. The silo has a cylindrical from, with variable height and diameter which is possible because a set of modular elements is used to be assembled in horizontal and vertical succession, the num ber of which will suit the requirements of the revelant project.On the foundation platform, a discharge cell can be mounted by employing a first set of modular elements having the same plant sizes of the silo and an adequate height. On this first set in vertical succession a further set of modulars is fitted with ana logous annular disposition for containing the costing for laying a slab having a central hole to house a rotating cutter which extract the ensiled product from below.This slab separates the actual silo from the discharging cell. The silo cell is obtained by the composition in vertical succession of many annular parts consisting of two or three sectors connected each other by stainless steel boltings. The connection is to be carried out after the mounting of the sectors forming the annular.The joints between annular and annular as well as between the sec tors of each annular are sealed with perfectly air and waterproof material having invariable features during the time. The silo mount ing is completed by laying the covering slab consisting of three prefabricated parts as well as by laying all the accessory parts, such as the charging pipe, the inspection stepladder, the discharg ing cutter and everything else. The silos charging is foreseen from above by means of the special piping rising by the silo side and entering in the covering slab centre. The piping is parallel to a metal ladder to be used for inspecting the construction top.A not limiting version of the execution is illustred by the drawings of Tables 1, 2 and 3.

Fig. 8 is the section of the slab Ib particular, and Fig. 9 the longitudinal section of the covering. When the excavation 1 has been carried out, a foundation 2 is cast and the foundation plinth 3 is cast on it. With a crane, structure A of elevation is positioned which results from the composition of eleven vertical sectors la, laid in special notches 2a in plinth 3, nine of which in perimeter composition and two inside, which act as a bridge for supporting the subsequent slab B limited by the annular consisting of five sectors lb from which the armature iron pieces 2b are projecting inwardly. The moulding is then executed of the inside circular slab 3b, at centre of which the union 4b is foreseen for fitting the product discharging device. The slab has also opening 5b for mounting the milling machine.For the slab 3b casting, the armature pads 7b are preset on crown 6b these pads form the caisson bottom and are integrating part of the slab after the casting completion. In components lb, recess 8b is foreseen for the cutter point, and also the seat 9b for the components la, as well as master template lOb of the elements lc of which the silo body is consisting.By changing the number of the superposed annulars, the height of the building and therefore the silo storage capacity can be modified.Annular C consists of three circular sector elements lc with an intermediate projecting part 2c acting as longitudianal resistance rib and end resistance semi ribs 3c and 4c they are determined in composition by imposition and blocked in an integrally operating way by means of the stainless steel tension rods D consisting of screw ld and two containment plates 2d and 3d with nuts 4d and washers 5d.The elements lc foresee a pair of longitudinal composition semi exavations Sc and 6c for containing a pair of silicon joints 4 which are previously pasted in the element semi excavation. The silo body can be executed by composing succession of element set lc. The mount ing foresees the auxiliary employ of a special light scaffolding of the jib crane type, for the safety of the pesonnel who are to bolt and fit the silicon. For mounting the roof, the central component le and the couple of laterals are foreseen 2e and 3e which altogether form the covering panel in which the pairs of horizontal semi excava tions 4e, Se, 6e and 7e will serve for the silicon pasting. Strucure E of the covering is foreseen with the jut annular projection 8e and the seat 9e for stabilizing the sector ic ends.A covering in rubber mantle l0e in which the charging hole lie and the inspection trap door 12e are foreseen. Outside, on components ic in proper positions, anchoring screws buried in concrete are foreseen for applying the stepladders 5 with gallery 6 for the discharge pipe 7 protection. In particular, the cell 8 discharges through door 9 and the excavation 8c allows the cutter housing in the discharging phase this avoids that the cutter still in position prevents the material discharge by acting as retainer. The particulars of the execution as well as everything else in this connection may be carried out in dif ferent ways.
