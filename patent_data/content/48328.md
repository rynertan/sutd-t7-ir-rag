# SUBLIMATION PATTERNING PROCESS

## Abstract
A method for patterning layers of material on a substrate without photoresist by using a selective sublimation process. A substrate 1 having a high thermal conductivity has a patterned layer 2 of a material having a low thermal conductivity deposited on its surface. A layer of high thermal conductivity patterning material 3, 5 is then deposited over the entire surface of the structure. A radiated energy source 4 is focused on the structure for sufficient time to allow the patterning material 3 above the low thermal conductivity material 2 to build up the internal heat level for sublimation. The patterning material 5 over the high thermal conductiv ity substrate 1 does not build up enough internal heat for sublimation and remains intact.
