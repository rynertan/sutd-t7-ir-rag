# Inter subsystem communication system.

## Abstract
The communication system connects sender subsystem 1 to receiver subsystem 2 through a communication path 15, 16 for transfer of data. The sender subsystem has sending buffers 11, 13, a send ing buffer address table BAT 9, and a buffer control block BCB 7, in a main storage. The receiver subsystem has receiver buffers 12, 14, a re ceiver buffer address table BAT 10, and a buffer control block BCB 8, in a main storage. When data is to be transferred the buffer control block BCB 7 designates buffer address table BAT 9 and an enqueue pointer in BCB 7 designates an entry in BAT 9 which designa tes a buffer 11, 13 from which data to be transferred is sent through a sender sub channel to a receiver sub channel to a designated buffer 12, 14 of the receiver subsystem.
