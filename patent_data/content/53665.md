# Testing embedded arrays in large scale integrated circuits.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit chip having an embedded array 10 which is not directly accessible from the primary input output chip pins is manufactured with additional test circuit ry directly on the chip, such that the performance of the array may be physically tested from the input output pins by an external chip tester while the array remains embedded. Because of the added test circuitry 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 26 , tests are not limited to the original chip architecture, and a variety of array tests may be made by an external tester without redesigning the chip architecture.
