## Description
MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM The present invention relates to a magnetic recording medium such as a magnetic tape, more particularly a magnetic recording medium having excellent mechanical strength and further excellent electrical characteristics and durability. Recently, it has been tried to make the thickness of a magnetic tape, particularly a magnetic tape for video tape recorder, as thin as possible in order to make the time of recording and reproduction of the tape as long as possible when it is put in a cartridge.However, when the thickness of a magnetic tape is made thin, it results in less mechanical strength thereof, and thereby, the magnetic tape occasionally buckles or is injured by contacting the edge of the tape with a guide for controlling running of the tape or an edge of a loading post for controlling a magnetic tape in case of recording, reproduction, fast feeding, turning back, loading or unloading, and further, it is easily curled or wrinkled. From this viewpoint, it has been proposed to improve the machanical strength of a magnetic tape by using as a base film a reinforced film obtained by drawing in longitudinal or width direction a plastic film such as polyester film when prepared. However, such a device is not yet satisfactory and can not sufficiently prevent the undesirable buckle, injury or curl of the edge of the tape. The magnetic layer of the magnetic recording medium is usually formed by coating a magnetic composition comprising magnetic particles, binders, organic solvents and other additives on a base film and drying. Aiming at the effect of the binder on the properties of magnetic recording medium, the present inventors have extensively studied various components of binders.As a result, it has been found that when a combination of at least one of the resins selected from vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, phenoxy resins, acrylic resins and fibrillar resins and a polyurethane resin containing 15 by weight or more of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate is used as a component of the binders for the magnetic layer, the elastic modulus of the magnetic layer is more improved and the magnetic tape has more improved mechanical strength, and thereby, even if the thickness of the magnetic tape is made thin, undesirable buckle, injury or curl of the edge of the tape can effectively be prevented, and further, the dispersibility and abrasion resistance of the magnetic par tides are also improved and thereby the magnetic recording medium shows improved surface smoothness of the magnetic layer and excellent electrical characteristics and durability. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved magnetic recording medium such as a magnetic tape which has excellent mechanical strength, excellent electrical characteristics and.durability. Another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic recording medium which can be used without undesirable buckle, injury or curl of the edge during the usage even in a thin thickness.These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. The magnetic recording medium of the present invention comprises a base carrier and a magnetic layer formed on the base carrier, which is characterized in that the binder for forming the magnetic layer on the base carrier comprises a combination of at least one of resins selected from the group consisting of a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resin, a polyvinylidene chloride resin, a phenoxy resin, an acrylic resin and a fibrillar resin, and a polyurethane resin containing 15 by weight or more of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The magnetic layer of the magnetic recording medium of the present invention is formed by using a magnetic composition comprising conventional components other than binders, such as magnetic particles, organic solvents and other additives. The polyurethane resin used as one component of the specific binder in the present invention contains 15 by weight or more, preferably 15 to 30 by weight, of 4,41 diphenylmethane diisocyanate as the isocyanate component. Said polyurethane resin is usually prepared by firstly preparing a polyester from a dibasic acid e.g. adipic acid and a diol e.g. 1,4 butanediol, 1,6 hexanediol by a conventional method and then reacting the polyester with 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The polyurethane resin contains as an isocyanate component 15 by weight of a straight chain 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate wherein two benzene rings are straightly bonded via methylene group and both benzene rings are substituted by an isocyanate group at para position thereof, and hence, the elastic modulus of the formed magnetic layer is more improved by the action of benzene rings bonded straightly with isocyanate group, and owing to the magnetic layer having excellent strength, there can be obtained a magnetic recording medium having excellent mechanical strength.A conventional polyurethane resin may contain 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate as the isocyanate component but the content thereof is lower than 15 by weight, and hence the action of the benzene rings bonded straightly is week, and hence, the improvement of elastic modulus of the magnetic layer is insufficient and further the mechanical strength of the magnetic tape is not sufficiently improved either. The resins used as another component of binder, such as vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, phenoxy resins, acrylic resins and fibrillar resins, have all excellent compatibility with the magnetic particles, and further have excellent coating properties and are effective on the excellent dispersibility of the magnetic particles, improvement of electircal characteristics of the magnetic tape and improvement of abrasion resistance of the magnetic tape because of forming a hard magnetic layer.Moreover, since the resins contain a hydroxy group or a carboxyl group within the molecule, the hydroxy or carboxyl group reacts with an isocyanate group contained in a low molecular weight isocyanate compound if it is incorporated as mentioned hereinafter to form a crosslinked bond, which is effective on more improvement of the strength of the magnetic layer and on more improvement of the abrasion resistance thereof. Suitable examples of the vinyl chloridevinyl acetate copolymer resins are vinyl chloridevinyl acetate vinyl alcohol copolymers, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymers, vinyl chloridevinyl acetate maleic acid copolymers, or the like, including commercially available products such asVAGH, VYHH and VMCH manufactured by U.C.C., U.S.A. ,Esreck A, Esreck C and Esreck M manufactured bySekisui Kagaku Kit., Japan , DENKAVINYL manufactured by Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K., Japan .Suitable examples of the polyvinyldene chloride resins are polyvinylidene chlorides, vinylidene chlorideacrylonitrile copolymers, vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride copolymers, or the like, including commercially available products such as Diophan 207D C manufactured by BASF, West Germany , SaraneF 216, F 120, F 220, F 300, F 310 manufactured byAsahi Dow Co., Japan , Denka 1000WK manufactured by Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K., Japan , Arone 321 manufactured by Toa Gosei Kagaku, Japan . Suitable examples of the phenoxy resins are commercially available PKHH, PKHC, PKHA manufactured by U.C.C., U.S A. . Suitable examples of the acrylic resins are polyacrylic esters, polymethacrylic esters, polyacrylonitriles, polyacrylamides, or the like, including commercially available products such asAcrynal 1000 manufactured by Toei Kasei, Japan . Suitable examples of the fibrillar resins is nitrocellulose and includes commercially available products such as Nitrocellulose L1 4, L1 2, L1, H1 4, H1 2, H1 and H5 manufactured by Asahi Kasei, Japan ,Nitrocellulose RS1 16, RS1 2, RS1 and RS2 manufactured by Daicel Chemical, Japan . The polyurethane resins containing 15 by weight or more of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and the resins such as vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, phenoxy resins, acrylic resins and fibrillar resins are preferably used in a ratio of 90 10 to 10 90 by weight, more preferably 70 30 to 40 60 by weight. When the amount of the polyurethane resins is smaller than the above range, the elastic modulus of magnetic layer is insufficiently improved, and on the other hand, when the amount of the polyurethane resins is larger than the above range, the dispersibility of magnetic particles is deteriorated. In addition to the above binder components, a low molecular weight isocyanate compound may be used as a binder component. The isocyanate compound is preferably trifunctional isocyanate compounds having a molecular weight of 200 to 3,000, which is prepared by reacting 1 mole of a triol and 3 moles of diisocyanate. When the isocyanate compound is used, the isocyanate group contained therein reacts with the hydroxy or carboxyl group contained in the vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resins, phenoxy resins, acrylic resins or fibrillar resins to form a crosslinked bond, and thereby, the strength and abrasion resistance of the magnetic layer are more improved. Suitable examples of the isocyanate compound having a low molecular weight are 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate, m phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,4 cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 1,5 tetrahydronaphthalene diisocyanate, 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, 4 chloro 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate, 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, or the like, and include commercially available products such as Colonate L,Colonate HL, Colonate 2036, Colonate 2014, Colonate 3015 and Colonate 3030 manuafactured by NipponPolyurethane Kogyo K.K., Japan , Desmodule L,Desmodule 15, Desmodule E14, Sumidule L, Sumidule IL,Sumidule T80, Sumidule 44V 20 and Sumidule PF manufactured by Sumitomo Bayer Urethane Co., Japan ,Takenate D102, Takenate D103, Takenate D103H, TakenateD204, Takenate DllON, Takenate D120N, Takenate M402 and Takenate M408 manufactured by Takeda Chemical,Japan , Crisbone NX, Crisbone CL 2 and Barnock DN 950 manufactured by Dainippon Ink Kagaku Kogyo K.K., Japan . The isocyanate compound having a low molecular weight may preferably be used in an amount of 0.1 to 30 by weight based on the total weight of the binder components. When the amount of the isocyanate compound is lower than the above range, it is less effective on the formation of crosslinked bond, and hence, the magnetic layer shows lower strength and less abrasion resistance, and on the other hand, when the amount is larger than the above range, the crosslink dnesity becomes too higher which may causes too hard magnetic layer and hence make the magnetic layer brittle. Among the other components of the magnetic composition, the magnetic particles include all conventional various magnetic particles, for example, T Fe203 particles, Fe304 particles, Co containingT Fe203 particles, Co containing Fe304 particles,Cr02 particles, and metallic magnetic particles e.g. Fe particles, Co particles, Fe Ni particles . The organic solvents include ketone solvents e.g. cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone , ester solvents e.g. ethyl acetate, butyl acetate , aromatic hydrocarbon solvents e.g.benzene, toluene, xylene , acid amide solvents e.g.dimethylformamide , ether solvents e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane which are suitable for dissolving the binder components. These solvents may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. The magnetic composition may also be incorporated by other conventional additives such as dispersing agents, lubricating agents, abrasives, electrostatic agents, or the like. The magnetic recording medium of the present invention can be prepared by a conventional method, for example, by adding at least one of the resins selected from vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, phenoxy resins, acrylic resins and fibrillar resins to a polyurethane diisocyanate and optionally adding thereto an isocyanate compound having a low meolecular weight and adding other components such as magnetic particles, organic solvents and other additions to the mixture, and coating the resulting magnetic composition to a base carrier such as a polyester film by a conventional method such as sparay coating or roll coating, followed by drying.
