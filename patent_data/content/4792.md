# Moving bed ion exchange method.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is provided for removing contaminants or for receiving valuable minerals by ion exchange treatment of a feed liquid, e.g. waste water or phosphoric acid. The resin bed is a moving bed which is circulated stepwise from the loading vessel 11 in which the feed liquid is treated into a regeneration vessel 14 . To obtain the advantages of a packed ion exchange resin bed system, a loading reservoir 13 is provided in the resin path between the regeneration vessel 14 and the loading vessel, rinsing and purging of the resin bed taking place in the reservoir 13 . Also, a regeneration reservoir 15 is provided in the resin path between the loading vessel 11 and the regeneration vessel 14 . Laminar flow of resin can be achieved, and bulk movement of the whole resin bed simultaneously can be avoided.
