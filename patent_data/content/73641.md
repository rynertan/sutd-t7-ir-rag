# Integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit device such as a gate array or a master slice LSI device which is formed on a semi conductor chip 1 and which comprises an inner cell array 8 including a plurality of inner cells 11 , an outer cell array including a plurality of outer cells 7 formed around the inner cell array 8 , a power supply portion 6 having one or more outer power supply lines, and a plurality of inner power supply lines 10 con nected to the outer power copy lines and formed on the inner cell array 8 . The ratio of the pitch of the outer cells 7 to the pitch of the inner power supply lines 10 or lines of the inner cells 11 is determined by the ratio of two integers. In the integrated circuit device, sets of outer 7 and inner 11 cells arranged in a predetermined positional relationship to each other are formed a plurality of times along the side of the semiconductor chip 1 .
