# Ambient or low temperature curable coating compositions for leather and other flexible substrates and methods of using them.

## Abstract
Ambient or low temperature curable coating composi tions are disclosed which comprise aldehyde polymer and hydrazide or hydrazone curing agent. The polymer con tains 0.25 to 10 acrolein or methacrolein, 0.5 to 10 acid and up to 99.25 of other units. The curing agent is a di carboxylic acid bis hydrazide or hydrazone. The composi tions may be used to coat flexible substrates such as leather and leather substitutes. A process is disclosed for coating such materials with finish, plate or embossing, color and top coats, in which at least the top coat compri ses such compositions.
