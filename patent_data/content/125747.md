# HEAT RESISTANT ELECTRICAL CONDUCTING WIRE

## Abstract
An electrical conducting wire 11 , capable of withstand ing high continuous operating temperatures without emitting smoke or halogens and without supporting flame, includes a conductive core 20 of nickel, or copper or iron plated with tin, nickel or silver and surrounded by a plurality of successive insulating layers 30, 40 of polyimide film strip or tape 31, 41 . The first of such layers 30 is formed by helically winding the tape of polyimide film about the core with adjacent edges overlapping. Each successive layer 10 is helically wound in the opposite direction and surrounding the next inner layer. A braided fiberglass jacket 50 encases the core 20 and the insulating polyimide film layers 30, 40 .
