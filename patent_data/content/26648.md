# Digital data transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
An interface provides a DMA direct memory access data transfer between a microprocessor 9 and a computer 16 . 8 bit data are transferred from the microprocessor data bus 12 via two data registers 20, 21 , and 8 bit address bytes from the microprocessor address bus 11 via two address registers 23, 24 , to two respective computer buses 13, 14 and hence as 16 bit words onto the computer bus 15 . A map key register 25 maps data signals supplied by the microprocessor 9 to computer memory addresses. A register 25 is provided for the reverse transfer information from the computer 16 to the microprocessor 9 . A programmable read only memory 64 is used to control the operation of the registers 20 to 25 such that an external transfer of information between the microprocessor 9 and the computer 16 is accomplished in response to internal instructions, such as a block move instruction, of the microprocessor 9 .
