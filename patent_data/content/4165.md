## Abstract
A piston and cylinder actuator for a tilting cab on a vehicle has a main piston 38 with a piston rod 40 extendable by application of hydraulic pressure to push port 28 and retractable by hydraulic pressure applied to pull port 30 . During retraction return of fluid from expansion chamber 34 is not possible through one way supply valve 78 but is controlled by poppet valve 68 . Valve 68 is spring biassed but can be opened by a combination of differential pressure across the valve and the movement of a pilot piston 66 acted upon by the pressure at the pull port 30 . The return path to the push port 28 is by way of a passage 52 in the poppet valve 68 . In a modification the pilot piston 66 first acts by way of a floating rod to open a valve in the passage 52 . The actuator provides smooth movement with a minimum of bouncing because it prevents the weight of the cab driving the piston rapidly after the cab passes the balanced position.
