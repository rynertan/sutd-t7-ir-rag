# SUSPENDED CEILING SRUCTURE FOR RECTANGULAR FILTER ELEMENTS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a suspended ceiling structure for rectangular filter elements 12, 13 , comprising a framework with outer 1 and inner 2 U shaped channels which slidingly fit into one another and are suspended in tie rods 9 in an upper ceiling. The channels are intended to support skirts 14, 15 arranged along the edges of the filter elements, said skirts being received in a sealing fluid 16 which forms an airtight seal for the air which is under the filter elements and is intended to flow through the same. The U shaped channels are provided with grooves 3, 4 at their web portions, the grooves being turned outwards and intended to form attachments for the ceiling tie rods and for elements 24 which should be suspended in the framework. The ends 5, 6 of each outer channel 1 are bent inwards to retain the inner channel 2 between the shanks and to prevent its withdrawal in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the channels.
