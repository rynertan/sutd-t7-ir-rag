## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 9 CARBAMOYL FLUORENE DERIVATIVES A group of 9 disubstituted fluorenes recently has been discovered to have potent antiarrhythmic activity see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,197,313 and 4,382,093.The 9 carbamoyl 9 aminoalkylfluorenes are among the most active compounds, and one compound within this group, namely 9 3 isopropylaminopropyl 9 carbamoylfluorene hydrochloride, is now known generically as indecainide. The reported synthesis of the 9 carbamoyl9 aminoalkylfluorenes have included acid hydrolysis of a 9 cyano 9 aminoalkylfluorene, and more recently reductive alkylation of a 9 carbamoyl 9 cyanoalkylfluorene, see U.S. Patent No. 4,282,170. The invention provides a process for producing a compound of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R4 is C1 C6 alkyl or a salt thereof which comprises reacting a compound of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein either 5 CONH2 and R6 is CH2 2CHO or 5 and R6, together, form the ringEMI2.2 with an amine of the formula R4NH2 and a reducing agent or isolating an intermediate of the following formula from reaction of the compound of formula II with amine EMI3.1 where R7 is CH OH NHR4 or CH NR4 and reducing the said intermediate. The compounds of formula II are of two types EMI3.2 Such compounds are in fact interchangeable since reaction of base on compound V readily yields the aldehyde of formula IV . In most systems an equilibrium between the two forms exists and the reactive species in the above process of the invention is probably always of formula IV . Notwithstanding this both species can be employed in the reaction. Amine R4NH2 and reducing agent can be added simultaneously or the reducing agent added after reaction with amine. The compounds of formula III are products of the reaction of amine with the compound of formula II and can be isolated and subsequently reacted with reducing agent. Often, however, it is preferable to avoid the extra step of isolating the intermediate product and to carry out the reaction in situ as described above. The compounds of formula II and III are novel and are provided in one aspect of the invention. The compounds of formulae II can be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a compound of the formulaEMI4.1 with acrolein CH2 CHCHO under basic conditions. Thus the invention also provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I as defined above, which comprises a reacting a compound of the formulaEMI5.1 with acrolein under basic conditions to provide a compound of formula EMI5.2 wherein R5 and R6 are as defined above, and b reacting the compound of formula II with an amine of the formula R4NHi and a reducing agent. In the above formulae R is C1 C6 alkyl.The term C1 C6 alkyl carries its art recognized meaning and includes methyl, isopropyl, tert. butyl and l,l dimethylbutyl. A particularly preferred R4 alkyl group is isopropyl. The reaction of amine with the compound of formula II above, is one of amination and, in the case where an intermediate is not isolated, the reaction is one of reductive amination. It is preferably carried out with approximately equimolar quantities of the reactants or with an excess of the amine, at a pH within the range of 6 to 10, such as for example 8 to 9, and at a temperature of from 200C to 1000C, such as for example from 250C to 800C. It is preferred to perform the reaction under basic conditions which may be ensured by the use of a molar excess of the amine reactant. The subsequent reduction in the case where an intermediate is isolated is carried out under similar conditions. Suitable reducing agents for use in the above process can be catalytic or chemical. Examples of the former kind include hydrogenation with palladium and charcoal, hydrogen and Adams catalyst PtO2 , and platinum on charcoal. Such catalytic methods of hydrogenation are discussed for instance in Practical CatalyticHydrogenation by M. Freifelder, Wiley Interscience, 1971, and in Catalytic Hydrogenation in Organic Synthesis by P.N. Rylander, Academic Press, 1979. Chemical reagents which may preferably be used include, for example, sodium cyanoborohydride, lithium cyanoborohydride, tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride. The first named reagent, which is the most preferred for use in the process of the invention, is reviewed, for example, in the paper by C.F. Lane, Aldrichimica Acta 1975, 8, 3.Reducing agents with too strong an effect should be avoided. The reaction is generally carried out in an inert organic solvent and we have found that acetonitrile, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate are particularly useful for this purpose but other solvents can be employed such as for example tetrahydrofuran and aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons, or if desired the amine reactant can be employed in sufficient quantity to serve both as reactant and solvent. The product can be extracted by routine procedures. As noted above compounds of formula II can be prepared by a novel process which comprises reaction with acrolein according to the following schemeEMI7.1 The reaction is carried out by combining the 9 carbamoylfluorene with acrolein in approximately equimolar quantities in the presence of a base. The particular base employed and the quantity are not critical, and an equimolar quantity or excess generally is used. Typical bases that can be employed include organic bases such as benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide Triton B , triethylamine, as well as alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride. The reaction is preferably conducted in an organic solvent, and typical solvents include ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, and aromatics such as benzene and toluene.The reaction typically is carried out at a temperature of about 0 to 100 C, and at such temperature is usually complete within about one to about eight hours. The product of the reaction, a tautomeric mixture of an aldehyde and a cyclic carbinol, is readily isolated by removing the reaction solvent or when a water miscible solvent has been employed, by dilution of the reaction mixture with water. The product can be crystallized from common solvents such as for example ethyl acetate or ether, when it is obtained predominantly in the carbinol form formula V which as such can be readily isolated. The following detailed Examples further illustrate this invention.
