# Bulk polymerization process.

## Abstract
A process to continuously bulk polymerize vinylic mono mers to prepare low molecular weight, uniform, polymers em ploys minor amounts of initiator and, optionally solvents, at short residence times and moderate reaction temperatures to provide high yields of a product suitable for high solids applica tions.
