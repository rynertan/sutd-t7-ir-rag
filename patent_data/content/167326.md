# Sensitizing agent for electroless plating and method for sensitizing substrate with the agent.

## Abstract
A sensitizing agent for electroless plating, comprising a solution of at least one of palladium II , silver I , copper I , copper II , and nickel II compounds in an amide is used for sensitizing substrates made of plastics or ceramics by treating the substrate with the sensitizing agent, followed by treating it with a reducing solution.
