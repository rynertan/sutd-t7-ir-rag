## Description
Apparatus for conveying biscuits, and confectionery products in general, towards awyappin machine The present invention relates to apparatus for conveying biscuits, and confectionery products in general, towards a wrapping machine. These biscuits may be of various types, both with regard to the consistency of the mixture which may be quite crumbly, and to the possible presence of a filling and or a coating, for example, a chocolate coating. In some cases they may also have granular coatings of, for example, almonds sprinkled on a coating of caramel or jam. Now,there is a need to feed such biscuits to a wrapping machine where the biscuits are individually wrapped in cellophane. Such packages can then be handled easily in the further stages of the production cycle up to consumption. The feeding of biscuits to a wrapping machine has, until now, encountered the contrasting needs of achieving a high rate of conveyance of the biscuits, as is clearly required in the large scale production of widely consumed products, and at the same time minimi sing the percentage of biscuits damaged in conveyance this is not only to avoid obvious wastage but also because damaged biscuits result in laborious operations for their removal. These disadvantages are clearly greater the more the biscuits are valued for the preparation of the mixture, the filling, and or the coating. The problem behind the present invention is that of devising apparatus of the type specified, which has such structural and functional characteristics as to satisfy the requirement explained in the preamble while overcoming the disadvantages mentiOned. This problem is solved by apparatus of the type specified which is characterised in that it includes a conveyor belt with equally spaced partitions defining cells, one for each biscuit, the belt having a smaller width than the width of the biscuits a continuous conveyor belt extending above the cellular belt at right angles thereto a continuous bladed chain conveyor having an active pass of its blades extending above the continuous belt in the direction of the cellular belt for displacing each biscuit from the continuous belt into a cell of the cellular belt, and a pair of continuous belts which extendlaterally of the cellular belt at a higher level than the latter and are driven at substantially the same speed as the blades. To advantage, the apparatus according to the invention includes an eccentric striker located at the end of the active pass of the blades to strike from above each biscuit conveyed by each blade. Further characteristics and advantages of the app aratus according to the present invention will emerge from the following description of a preferred embodiment given, by way of non limiting example, with reference to the single appended drawing which is a schematic perspective view of apparatus according to the invention. With reference to the appended drawing, there.is generally indicated 1 apparatus for conveying biscuits, each indicated 2, towards an entirely conventional type of wrapping machine, generally indicated 3, in which the biscuits are individually wrapped in cellophane. The apparatus 1 includes a conveyor belt 4 formed from a succession of metal links 5 carrying partitions, each indicated 6, which are spaced equally along the belt 4 to form cells, each indicated 7, defined by adjacent partitions and intended to receive a respective biscuit 2. The belt has a smaller width than the width of the biscuits 2. The distance between one partition and the next is fixed in dependence on the length of the biscuit to be wrapped in cellophane, and on the space necessary between one biscuit and the next for the heat sealing of the cellophane between the biscuits in the wrapping machine 3. The apparatus 1 further includes a continuous conveyor belt 8 which is supplied with biscuits 2 and extends above the belt 4 at right angles thereto. The belt 4 and the belt 8 are supported by a supporting frame of an entirely conventional type which is not shown so as not to over burden the drawing. A stop 9 is fixed to the frame and is located above the belt 8 in correspondence with the belt 4, to stop the biscuits 2 on the belt 8. On a section between the stop 9 and a photocell 10 supported by the frame, the biscuits 2 are arranged on the belt 8 in a continuous line, that is, touching each other, while on the remaining section the biscuits 2 are generally spaced from each other. A further continuous conveyor belt 11 is located upstream of the belt 8. The belt 11 is supplied with biscuits from a production unit, such as a baking oven or a unit in which the biscuits are, for example, coated with chocolate, and in its turn supplies the belt 8. In an entirely conventional manner, the photocell 10 is always filled with a continuous line of biscuits 2.Guide strips are provided along the belts 8, 11 to guide the biscuits 2 laterally along these belts. The apparatus 1 according to the invention further includes a continuous chain conveyor 12 with blades 13, the active pass of the blades extending above the continuous belt 8 in the direction of the belt 4. A pair of continuous belts 14, 15 formed from metal links 16 extend laterally of the belt 4 at a predetermined distance of, for example, a few millimetres above the latter, and are driven at a speed substantially equal to the speed of the blades 13. The belt 4 has a pass which is prolonged relative to the belts 14, 15 and extends into the wrapping machine 3. An eccentric striker 17 is located.at the end of the active pass of the blades 13 of the continuous conveyor 12, this striker 17 having a circular trajectory in order to strike from above each biscuit conveyed by the blades 13. The operation of the apparatus 1 according to the invention is described below. As they bear against the stop 9, the biscuits 2 in the line of biscuits on the belt 8, which advances in the direction of the arrow F, are displaced transversely one at a time by the blades 13, which advance in the direction of arrow G, until they leave the belt 8 laterally. They fall from there onto the belts 14, 15 which advance in the direction of the arrow H at a speed substantially equal to that of the blades 13. The fall and, in particular, the detachment of each biscuit 2 from the blade 13 which has displaced it are facilitated by the eccentric striker 17 which, driven in phase with the blades, strikes each biscuit 2 from above at the moment the blade 13 reaches the limit of its own active pass. The conveyor belt 4, which advances in the direction of arrow I, is also driven in phase with the blades 13 so that each biscuit falls from the belt 8 into a cell 7. Each biscuit is thus conveyed by the belt 4 to the wrapping machine where it is wrapped in cellophane. In the apparatus according to the invention, each biscuit is subjected individually to the forces necessary for its conveyance and, from the belt 8 to the machine 3, is transported positively, first by the blades 13 and then in the cells 7. This results in a minimum of damage to the biscuits, and avoids the accumulation of crumbs or particles which can become detached from the biscuits and may be sticky. Moreover, from what has been described above, it is clear that the time in which each biscuit 2 is pressed against the stop 9 by the action of the belt 8 and by the thrust of the other biscuits in the line may be reduced to very small values, practically eliminating any damage to the biscuits. Indeed, the speed of the blades 13 may even be chosen so as to be quite high, without the biscuits 2 which are pushed by the blades 13 towards the cellular belt 4 faltering at this point due to the excess relative speed, by virtue of the presence of the pair of lateral belts 14, 15 which are at a higher level than the belt 4 and have substantially the same speed as the blades 13. Thus, it is possible to arrange the biscuits 2 on the cellular belt 4 at the desired rate for the wrapping machine 3 without damage to the biscuits. By virtue of the apparatus according to the invention, the important advantage of a high rate of conveyance of the biscuits towards the wrapping machine is achieved without damage to the biscuits themselves.
