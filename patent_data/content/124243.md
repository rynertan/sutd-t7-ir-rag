# Compounds medicaments and apparatus for controlling blood pressure.

## Abstract
Compounds and compositions are provided for treating high blood pressure and disturbances of cardiac function. The active compounds are dynorphin related opioid peptides, such as dynorphin 1 13 and dynorphin 1 10 amide, having at least ten amino acids linked sequentially by peptide bonds and with the five amino acids from the N terminal end being the same as, for mimicking, Leu enkephalin. Administration may be over a period of time, as for individuals with chronic high blood pressure, and may be by dispensing the medicament in aerosol form.
