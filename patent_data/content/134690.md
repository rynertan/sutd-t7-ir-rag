# Ambient air heated electrically assisted cryogen vaporiser.

## Abstract
A high volume cryogen vaporizer includes a radiator where a working fluid draws heat from ambient air for vaporizing a cryogen in a heat exchanger. An electrical heater is provided for periodically heating the working fluid to defrost the radiator, thereby allowing sustained operation of the vaporizer. When not required for defrosting the radiator, the heater may be operated to heat a working fluid in a circuit separate from that of the radiator, and in which the heated working fluid is used for further elevating the temperature of the vaporized cryogen in a second heat exchanger, thereby making possible a gas output tempera ture higher than ambient air temperature.
