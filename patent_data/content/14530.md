## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO PROCESSES AND MATERIALS FOR DETECTING AND DETERMINING PROTEINACEOUS SPECIFIC BINDING AGENTS AND MATERIALS BINDABLE THERETO This invention concerns improvements In or relating to processes and materials for detecting and determining proteinaceous specific binding agents and materials bindable thereto. The invention has particular application for example to the detection and determination of antibodies and their corresponding antigens or haptens, among other materials which take part in avid specific binding reactions. Know analytical methods exist for detecting and determining antigens, haptens and antibodies of a wide variety of types, and other substances w ni ch take part in avid specific binding reactions, such as avidin which binds biotin , thyroxin binding globulin, and transcortin which binds cortisol . among the large number of antigens, haptens and antibodies for which analytical methods have been devised are for example insulin and anti insulin human chorionic gonadotrophin and antibodies thereto antibodies against disease producing organisms such as Toxoplasms as Toxoplasma, Entamoeba and Treponema, and antigenic components of such organisms themselves virus components such as hepatitis antigen and antibodies thereto normal and abnormal tissue components, derivatives thereof and antibodies thereto, such as proteins including immunoglobulins themselves such as IgG and IgM, and degradation products thereof, such as Fc fragments of IgG, low molecular weight hormones, such as oestradiol nutritional factors such as folate and drugs such as opium alkaloids and cardiac steroids such as dioxin. Among the known techniques for carrying out assay of such materials are radioimmunoassays, and immunoassays dependent on the detection of something other than a radioactive label, for example a fluorescent material, an electron spin label or an enzyme. US Patents 3,654,090, 3,791,932, 3,839,153, 3,850,752 and 3,879,262 are representative of immunoassays dependent on the use of a covalent conjugate of an enzyme with one component of a pair of specific binding reaction components of interest in the assays in question. Assays of this type have Droved to be in many ways useful and convenient.However, there is a need for assay materials and systems with a potential for greater sensitivity, and which can be arranged into assay methods which are flexible and convenient in use According to this invention there are provided materials for the detection or determination of an analyte a7hich is a component of the reaction between proteinaceous binding agents and materials bindable thereto, in which one of the reaction components, i.e a binding agent or a material bindable thereto, is fixed or coupled to the surface of vesicles which contain a quantity of enzyme containing aqueous material which is occluded from contact with the bulk of the suspending medium in the absence of lytic conditions, and in which one of the reaction components is immobilised on a solid carrier in a form which is able to accept the binding of a complementary reaction component when fixed or coupled to the vesicles.This latter immobilised component is ref erred to herein as an immunoadsorbent. The materials for the detection oAeter mination of all analyte which is one of the reaction components, can conveniently be in the form of a test kit having dosed quantities of the components in a form suitable for their application to assay. They can also include a l ytic agent for releasing or rendering accessible the contents of vesicles, for reacting with vesicles which have taken part in a detection or determination reaction, and a substrate yielding detectable product upon which the enzyme can react once released or rendered accessible by the lytic agent. The binding specificities of the reaction components fixed or coupled to the surface of the vesicles and immobilised on the solid carrier can take any of a very wide variety of forms and combinations which in themselves can be analogous to the specificities and configurations of knows binding assays and immunoassays and in themselves do not constitute this invention. Uhey will be determined by the identity of the material which it is desired to assay and by the desired assay configuration. A number of examples of these are given below to facilitate understanding of the present invention and illustrate particular applications of it. The materials provided according to the invention are used according to the invention in a binding assay method for one of the above mentioned reaction components in which both the vesicle fixed or coupled reaction component mentioned above, and the immunoadsorbent capable of accepting the binding of vesicles which have a complementary reaction component bound or coupled thereto, are used, and in which the detection or determination of a portion of the vesicles which has reacted in an amount which is dependent upon the amount of any analyte present is carried out by lysing any such reacted vesicles with the lytic agent so as to release or render accessible the enzyme contained therein, and determining the amount or presence of any such released enzyme by reaction with a substrate that gives rise to a detectable product. In the materials according to the invention the specificity of the immunoadsorbent can be either complementary or homologous to that of the reaction component fixed or coupled to the vesicles, i.e. they can bind together, or they can bind to similar or common binding partners, respectively. In one embodiment, an assay method according to the invention comprises 1 immobilising an antibody B to an antigen A to be detected or determined , which can for example be an amphipathic antigen, onto an activated solid surface to form an immunoadsorbent 2 fixing any antigen A present in the test sample to surface membranes of vesicles, preferably liposomes, filled with an enzyme marker 3 bringing said vesicles carrying antigen A into intimate contactzmththe immunoadsorbent to bind any antigen A fixed on the vesicles, to B 4 releasing the enzyme marker by causing lysis of the vesicle 5 measuring the level of enzyme marker. In an embodiment particularly applicable to monovalent antigens, an assay method according to the invention can comprise 1 immobilising antigen molecules, A, similar to those to be determined, on an activated sold surface to form an immunoadsorbent 2 fixing antibody B specific to antigen A, on the surface membranes of vesicles filled with a marker enzyme 3 bringing the vesicles carrying antibody B into intimate contact with a test sample which possibly contains antigen A, and then with the immobilised antigen A in the form of the immunoadsorbent 4 releasing the marker enzyme by causing lysis of any vesicles carrying B bound to immobilised A 5 measuring the level of marker enzyme by causing formation of products of the enzymatic reaction between the marker enzyme and an appropriate substrate. If the sample contains analyte antigenA , this will react with B fixed on the vesicles then there will be less free B available to react with the immobilised A, and the level measured in step 5 will be correspondingly reduced as compared with the level found in the absence of analyte in the sample. When the analyte antigen A to be determined is at least bivalent, a preferred process according to the inveition can involve the following steps 1 immobilising an antibody B to analyte antigen A , onto an activated solid surface to form an immunoadsorbent 2 binding any analyte antigen A present in the test sample to 3 by bringing the test sample into intimate contact with the immunoadsorbent 3 binding to analyte antigen A a bi functional complex B fixed on the surface membranes of vesicles filled with an enzyme marker and carrying an amphipathic antigen 4 releasing the enzyme marker by causing lysis of the ves icle 5 measuring the level of enzyme marker, e.g. as described above. 31n step 3 of the above process according to the invention, the amphipathic antigen is bound to the bifunctional complex 31 which consists of an antibody C specific to the amphipathic antigen and an antibody D to antigen A. Antibody D can be a preparation similar to antibody B. Antibody D can alternatively be capable of binding to antigen A through different antigenic determinants of antigen A, as compared with the specificity of antibody 3. An embodiment of the process of the invention for detecting or determining an antibody can involve the following steps 1 immobilising an antigen Y to which antibody X is specific, onto an activated solid surface to form an immunoadsorbent 2 binding any antibody X present in the test sample to the immobilised antigen Y by bringing the test sample into intimate contact with the immunoadsorbent 3 binding x to a bifunctional complex B consisting of a heterologous antiglobulin Z specific to the antibody tgpe and species to which X belongs, and an antibody C specific to an amphipathic antigen fixed on the surface membrane of vesicles filled with a marker enzyme 4 releasing the marker enzyme by causing lysis of the vesicle, and 5 measuring the level of marker, e.g. as described above. It will be understood that in this embodiment according to the invention the sequence of the steps 1 to 3 can be reversed. The use of enzymes occluded in vesicles having an immunological sensitisation, in conjunction with immuno sorbents capable of receiving the specific binding of such sensitised vesicles when their immunological valencies are suitably complementary, brings advantage in flexibility and convenience of assay procedure. For example, it enables a seraratlor OT solid phase and licuid phase to be carried out either by washing or continuous flow for example with the handling convenience offered by solid absorbents, while on release of enzyme from the occluded form even from vesicles which have been fixed to the solid carrier the released enzyme is measurable in solution in the absence of the solid carrier and can retain its full activity. In known solid phase adsorption processes, any adsorbed enzyme has suffered either chemical coupling or avid binding in a way which generally affects both its activity, whether by denaturation or the kinetic effect of adsorption or steric hindrance, or by more than one of these causes , and its ease of handling. Furthermore, it is easy to arrange for the occluded aqueous environment of the enzyme within the vesicles to be relatively conducive to its satisfactory storage and preservation, and after such occlusion it remains physically relatively unaffected by subsequent stages of the preparation and assay. Furthermore, materials and methods of this invention can provide a double amplification in the number of detectable product molecules relative to the number of analyte molecules which is greater than either the amplification available with single enzyme molecules chemically coupled to immunological reagents or that given by previous attempts to amplify enzyme linked immunoassay in that both the ratio of the molecules of enzyme associated with a given number of molecules of analyte or its complementary reaction component can be higher, and also the state of preservation of activity in those enzyme molecules can be better, i.e. more active, because of their occlusion during many of the reaction stages, as mentioned above.This can lead to highly satisfactory sensitivity relative to background in a suitable assay configuration. The vesicles referred to in this specification are in themselves known, as sac like structures, e.g. liposomes, which are artificial spherules composed of phospholipids arranged to form a bi lamellar membrane in which polar groups are arrayed externally and and hydrocarbon chains form a hydrophobic core. Liposomes can be prepared according to the method of Gregoriadis et al, FEBS Betters, The 95 1971 or according to the method ofBatzri et al Biochem. Biophys. Acta 298, 1015. Because of the hydrophobic core it is possible to introduce a variety of amphipathic antigens into the membrane, to give an immunological valency to the liposomes.One very convenient such material is bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which can conveniently be that obtained from E.coli 0149 strains well known and commercially available . Further methods of preparing liposomes are referred to in for example US Patent No. 3,850,578, which concerns free radical loaded liposomes used in agglutination type and complement mediated immunological reactions. One method of preparing liposomes useful for example in connection with the present invention is to suspend a membrane forming lipid mixture, comprising phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidylethanolamine and sterol, into an aqueous medium containing bile salt or equivalent detergent, e.g. deoxycholate, any amphiphilic antigen to be incorporated into the sacs, e.g. lipopolysaccharide 0149, and any enzyme to be occluded in the liposomes. The detergent and non occluded materials can then be removed by gel filtration. Particular methods of preparing suitable vesicles are described in detail below. The vesicles, e.g. liposomes, can for example have a volume per particle corresponding to diameters of equivalent spheres or can be roughly spherical with diameters of about 0.01 10 microns. The methods described herein can result in the occlusion of for example 3 to 30 microliter, e.g. 10 microliter, of enzyme containing liquid per micromole of lipids used to form the liposomes. For use in the invention the vesicles have fixed or coupled thereto an immunologically reactive material of specificity appropriate to the Åaetermin2t on ol intered. This can be achieved for example by fixation of an antigen into the structure of thr vesicle, e.g. lipopolysaccharide 0149 of E.coli, or b coupling of a desired immunologically reactive material to the vesicle by covalent bonding using a chemical coupling agent or by avid binding, or both. For example, a material desired to be coupled to the vesicle can be coupled to a component of the vesicle, e.g. the amino groups of phosphatidylethanolamine, by using a coupling reagent that reacts with said component to give an activated product that subsequently couples covalently with the material to be coupled. Examples of such coupling reagents are knout in themselves and the coupling does not in itself constitute this invention .Suitable coupling reagents include for example dialdehydes such as glutaraldehyde, and adipimidate see for example GB Specification 1,470,955 .It is generally desirable to use coupling agents that give rise to linkage groups between vesicle and coupled material that are as long as possible, to avoid steric hindrance, e.g.equivalent to the length of a carbon chain having at least 5 carbon atoms, e.g. up to 20 carbon atoms. Glutaraldehyde gives rise to a linkage group CH A 5CE , i.e. of 5 carbon atoms, and may also give a proportion of linkage groups having longer, condensed, chains. The material to be coupled in this way can be for example an inmunoglobulin, a protein or polypeptide antigen, or a non protein antigen capable of reacting with the coupling agent, e.g. having a free amino group. Other coupling methods which can be used, additionally or alternatively, are described in for example US Patent No.3,817,837 cols. 31 34 and GB Specifications 1,316,990 and 1,485,122 3. Additional use of coupling reagents means that the active groups left after reaction of one coupling agent are exposed to reaction themselves with a further coupling reagent. An alternative or additional and desirable coupling rto consists of binding to an immunologically reactive group which itself is fixed or coupled to a vesicle, e.g.by one of the methods just described above, a compound bearing immunological valency of the complementary specifi ciqS, optionally itself chemically or physically coupled to a material having a desired further immunological specificity. For example, liposomes bearing bacterial lipopolysaccharide can be treated with antibody thereto, so that they bear an immunological valency corresponding to the antigenic type of the immunoglobulin constituting the antibody. Alternatively, the liposomes can be reacted with a bifunctional coupled complex, consisting of such an anti lipopolysaccharide antibody which is chemically coupled to a further antigen or antibody of interest, evg. anti human alpha fetoprotein , e.g. by reaction with glutaraldehyde, or ethyl N carbomoyl cyano methyl l iminoacetate followed by diazotisation and further coupling see G3 Specification No. 1,316,990 . The resulting liposome preparation then has an immunological valency with the specificity of the anti human alpha fetoprotein or other material coupled to the anti lipopolysaccharide. In another example, a protein fixed or coupled to liposomes can have its complementary binding partner coupled thereto by their avid binding reaction, and the resulting complex covalently linked by treatment with dimethyl suberimidate see Gersten and Harchalonis, J. Immunol.Methods 1978 24 305 for the use of this coupling agent , or an alternative covalent bridging reagent. For example, protein A from Staphylococcus aureus can be coupled to vesicles using glutaraldehyde, and bound by its characteristic affinity to the Fc group of an immunoglobulin having a desired antibody specificity. The linkage between proteinA and the bound antibody can then be made covalent by reaction both the dimethyl suberimidate, to give a vesicle preparation with the specificity of the antibody. Generally the result of the coupling will be that an immunologically reactive material of desired specificity is coupled to the vesicles, e.g. liposomes, via a l r age comprising a linkage group which is equivalent in length at least to a carbon chain of 5 atoms, e.g up to 20 atoms the linkage may comprise a plurality of such linkage groups and or one or a plurality of protein molecules. The particular coupling methods chosen aim to provide the desired immunological valency sufficiently free of steric hindrance to react with an immunosorbent of suitably complenentary valency, as described below. By way of example, the methods described herein can be used to give attachment of 0.3 10 micrograms, e.g 1 5 micrograms, of antibody to liposomes for each micromole of lipids used to form the liposomes. Each liposome may have a number of effective binding sites for example in the range 10 100 per liposome. Alternative vesicle preparations to those noted above can incorporate instead of bacterial lipopolysaccharide other amphiphilic antigens, such as erythrocyte membrane antigens and myelin antigens. In most cases, the result and desired effect is to produce according to the invention a composition of lipid vesicles having an aqueous preparation of an enzyme releasably occluded therein, said vesicles having fixed to their surfaces via a spacer group or spacer molecule a homologue or specific binding partner of an analyte to be detected or determined. A homologue is understood here to mean a material with specific affinity for a similar binding partner to that of the analyte. The spacer molecule or group can be for example the residue of a dialdehyde group of at least 5 carbon atoms or the residue of a coupling reagent of at least equivalent molecular size or length thereto , the residue of dimethyl adipimidate, protein A of S.aureus, or antibody directed against amphipathic lipid such as lipo tolvsaccharide include in the vesicles. Together with the solid support materials having surfaces to which are fixed one of the components of the specific binding reaction between two reaction components one of which corresponds to the analyte, and wit the lytic agent and the substrate, such compositions form the test kits described herein. The methods given above can be used to produce vesicles loaded with enzyme and sensitised by fixation of an immuno logically reactive material via a spacer molecule or linkage group suffciently large to leave the reactive material adequately unhindered sterically for binding to sensitised immunoadsorbent. The enzyme which is chosen for its occlusion in the vesicles can be any enzyme of choice. The most desirable are those available in quantity with high activity and stability and which possess safe convenient substrates leading to easily measurable products. Fydrolases, oxidases and reductases provide suitable examples. The most preferred convenient enzyme is alkaline phosphatase for which pnitrophenyl phosphate is a convenient substrate leading to a convenient easily measurable yellow product, p nitrophenol. Another convenient enzyme is horseradish peroxidase, usable with substrates hydrogen peroxide and chromogen see, e.g., GB Specification No. 1,348,935 8 . The nature of the immunoadsorbent is an important feature of the invention, in combination with the remaining material characteristics described herein. The solid support must be in a form which when immunologically sensitised can accept the binding of immunologically sensitised vesicles having suitable valency. Preferably the solid support has a solid i.e. nonporous surface, e.g. that of a solid polymer such as polystyrene or nylon, to which immunologically reactive material can be coupled. Use can also be made of inorganic solids to which such material can be coupled. For example, antigen or antibody can be coupled to nylon using adipimidate reagent after partial hydrolysis of n on to 7ffield a ino groups, e.g. as the use of this coupling agent is described in G3 Specification No. 1,470,955. Alternatively, antibody can be adsorbed to polystyrene. This is however somewhat less preferable as it makes certain additional precautions desirable and even in their presence there may be a degree of steric hindrance resulting in lower effective binding capacity of the immunoadsorbent for the sensitised vesicles. A suitable preparation and precautions are for example exposure of the polystyrene surfaces to the antibody e.g. about 5 g ml and incubation, e.g. overnight at 370C, followed by conducting any further reactions with materials which do not include detergent until it or another lytic agent is finally required to lyse any adherent vesicles and conducting any further reactions in the presence of ovalbumin te.g. 1 w v , or other inert protein to neutralise non specific adsorption. Another method of coupling materials to polystyrene is to nitrate the polystyrene to a convenient degree, reduce the nitro groups to amino groups and react the aminopolystyrene with a coupling reagent, e.g. glutaraldehyde, followed by the material to be coupled. A further example of a suitable solid support material is cellulose acetate. Generally, the coupling methods discussed above in connection with vesicle preparations are also applicable to the preparation of immunoadsorbents with any modifications which may be necessitated by the nature of the solid material used as support. Such modifications are in themselves known techniques and form no part of this invention.Applicable methods relating to nylon are described for example by Inman et al, Biochem. J. 1972 129 255 262, andMorris et al, Biochem J. 1975 147, 593 603. Protein A of Stan 910coccus aureus is a very suitable coupling material for coupling immunoglobulins both to vesicles and to solid supports using the methods described above. A method for its preparation is described for example in US Patent No.3,850,798 and its properties are reviewed by J. Langone, in J. Im unol. Methods 1978 24, 269 285. One reason for its particular desirability is that it can bind specifically to the Fc parts of immunoglobulin molecules leaving their specific confining sites for their normal binding partners the Fab parts unhindered. This orientation can help the capture efficiency of the antibodies used in the assay and test materials. The form of the solid surfaces carrying the immunoadsorbent reactive groups is generally immaterial in the practice of the invention convenient forms of solid support are for example tubes, wells, granules, grains, flecks, plates and slides of the material forming the solid support surface. where a tube carries a binding reagent or its specific binding partner, it can be made to fit automated continuousflow equipment so that certain embodiments of the tests and assays can be integrated into automatic analyser systems with exchangeable tube bound binding reagents. The lytic agents used according to this invention can be any suitable means for releasing enzyme from its occluded state in the vesicles. Suitable lytic agents include for example detergents, such as Triton X 100, but may consist of hypotonic solutions when the tonicity of the occluded phase is sufficiently high to lead to lysis of the vesicles in more dilute solutions. The final essential component of the test materials is a substrate for reacting with the occluded enzyme after its release from the vesicles. Any convenient substrate giving a conveniently measurable product is suitable. Examples include p nitrophenyl phosphate for use with alkaline phosphatase, giving a yellow product p nitrophenol 4 methyl ibelliferyl phosphate for use with alkaline phosphatase giving a highly fluorescent product 4 methyxl umbelliferone and hydrogen peroxide and any of several chromogens for use with horseradish peroxidase, leading to easily measurable coloured products Nany other examples have been described in connection with enzyme linked immunoassay systems and are applicable here too. A number of different assay and test configurations can be employed with materials and methods according to this invention, in addition to those already mentioned. For example, materials can be provided for a competitive binding assay or test in which enzyme loaded vesicles bearing a specific binding valency homologous to that of the analyte are provided together with immunoadsorbent having a limiting quantity of the complementary specific binding valency.The assay can then be carried out by mixing the analyte and assay or test materials, separating bound and free vesicles, lysing one of the separated vesicle portions and allowing the liberated enzyme to act on its substrate, yielding a measurable product. Other competitive binding configurations are illustrated for example by the enzyme coupled assay schemes of US Patent No. 3,654,090, 3,839,153 and 3,850,752. In modifications of these configurations the reactants can be reacted sequentially instead of competing simultaneously. A preferred assay or test configuration involves test materials in which the enzyme loaded vesicles and the immunoadsorbent can both bind to the analyte but not to each other. This gives a sandwich format it is of advantage where the specificity of the vesicles and of the immuno adsorbent can distinguish different determinants on the analyte, e.g. where the analyte is an antibody, one of the specificities can be that of its corresponding antigen, while the other can be that of a corresponding anti immuno globulin. The sandwich configuration is generally applicable only to antibodies and their binding partners which them selves are of high molecular weight so that they are bivalent, i.e. have o or more specific binding sites.The other configur5eions are used when low molecular weight binding partners are the analytes, e.g. digoxin and haptens, which generally are monovalent. 7ne present invention is applicable to the detection determination of a very large variety of materials that take p t in anid specific binding reactions wherever immunolog ccl reagents or reaction components are referred to herein, analogous non immunological reagents or reaction components are also understood as included.Examples are alpha fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, thyroxin binding globulin, pregnancy associated alpha 2 glycoprotein, antibodies to Toxotlasma organisms, hepatitis antigen, rubella antigens, allergens, immunoglobulins E reagins , Tretonema antigens, cardiolipin, haemoglobins, immunoglobulins M, dioxin, insulin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, streptococcal antigens, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and antibodies corresponding to those of the above mentioned materials that are antigens. Further materials which can be detected and determined by the use of assay materials as described herein and having corresponding specificity are listed for example in US Patent No. 3,996,345. The detailed preparative and assay procedures and conditions used in conjunction with this invention are in themselves generally those associated with the handling of very small quantities of rather labile biological materials and are in themselves well known. In general, assays are carried out in buffered aqueous media, e.g. pH 5.5 to 10, often 6.5 to 9, the buffers being inert and for present purposes free of detergent at least until the stage of the assay when the lytic agent is called for. Citrate and phosphate are suitable buffer examples. Generally present can be non detergent inhibitors of non specific binding phenomena, e.g. inert proteins such as purified ovalbumin from henls egg, e.g at 0.1 1 w v.The buffer solutions can be salinated, e.g. with NaCl to be isotonic with about 0.9 NaCl. The concentrations of analytes which can be of interest m the assays can be for example in the wide range of about micromolar to fractions of picomolar, e.g. 10 6M to 10 13M although with certain assays concentratiors outside these ranges may be of interest and detectable. To forn the kits of assay materials the quantities of assay materials are chosen to set their quantities in relation to the analyte concentrations of interest. For example a vesicle preparation or immunosorbent which is complementary and can bind to the analyte can be present from about 0.1 times the minimum concentration to be detected up to about 100 times the maximum to be detected, based on equivalence of binding capacity usually up to about 10 times the maximum to be detected. Another component of the reaction can be present either in excess or in comparable quantity, depending on the chosen assay configuration. Generally the components are present in amounts in which the quantity of sensitised vesicles reacting with the immunoadsorbent is dependent on the quantity of analyte present in the concentration range of interest. The assays and tests can be carried out so that the binding reactions reach equilibrium, or alternatively so that the amount of product depends on the rate of a critical reaction carried on for a standard time. The reaction times for each assay step where more than one can range from 0.1 minute to about 8 hours, preferably about 1 30 minutes, e.g.5 to 15 minutes. The required reaction times where a ratedependent assay is used can be adjusted within limits by choice of reagent concentration stanardised reaction times of 15 seconds to 30 minutes can be used, at standard temperatures, e.g. 15 C 40 C. The order of reagent additions will usually be dictated by the assay configuration chosen. In carrying out the assays and tests and preparing the test materials, it is desirable to avoid non specific adsorption of materials important in the assay both to vesicles and to immunoadsorbents, and for this purpose assays can generally be carried out in the presence of a non detergent inhibitor of non specific adsorption, e.g an n e.g. ovalbumin where this particular material plays no part in the assay in question , and in the absence of detergent until this or another lytic agent is called for to release enzyme from the vesicles at the appropriate time. It will normally be desirable or necessary, in preparing and using assay and test materials as described herein, to carrot out a number of measurements and calibrations of the materials so prepared, in accordance with principles and methods that are well known in themselves. For example it will often be desirable to quantitate the specific binding capacities of the immunoadsorbents and vesicles sensitised by coupling or fixation of immunologically active materials.This can be done e.g. by measuring specific uptake of standardised radiolabelled specific binding partners, or standar dised bindable preparations labelled and dosed in other ways. Calibration of a given assay configuration can be carried out by for example performing parallel tests with serial dilutions plus saturation and null controls in a manner well known in itself. Generally the quantity of product from enzyme liberated from vesicles measured at the end of a given test will show either a direct or inverse relation to the quantity of analyte over a region of dependence on analyte concentration, usually accomp nied by a background value. Low background levels can normally.be arranged in assay configurations using bivalent andlytes, such as large molecular weight antigens and antibodies, in a sandwich format in which immunoadsorbent and sensitised vesicles each bind specifically to the analyte but not to each other. auger background levels are naturally encountered where there is an inverse relation between analyte concentration and final measured enzyme product. It can be seen in view of the foregoing description and appended examples that the invention also provides a test complex for the detection or determination of an analyte selected from proteinaceous binding reagents and their specific binding partners, said complex comprising analyte in comb4nation with a a reaction component selected from specific binding partners and homologues of the analyte in coupled form to a surface of a solid support material, and b a reaction component selected from specIfic binding partners and homologues of said analyte coupled to the surface of lipid vesicles having releasablv occluded therein an aqueous preparation of an enzyme Th some embodiments the complex will be a sandwich type complex with sensitised vesicles bound to the immunoadsorbent via the analyte, and in others the immunoadsorbent will have some of its binding sites occupied by analyte and some occupied by sensitised vesicles of complementary binding specificity. Also, throughout the specification, where embodiments are given with reference to antigens and antibodies, it is understood that the invention also embraces the complementary alternative embodiments in which the place of antigen is taken by antibody and vice verso The following description gives preparative details for some examples of assay materials used according to this invention. It will be apparent that where the preparation refers to antibodies or other specific binding agents, binding agents of alternative specificity can be substituted, to give the manufacture of analogous test materials for the assay of alternative analytes. The preparative details given are only examples of those that enable assays to be carried out in accordance with this invention, and numerous modifications and variations will be apparent to the reader skilled in the art.PreParation 1 The following procedure can be used to produce a suspension in aqueous medium of liposomes having entrapped enzyme r this instance it is alkaline phosphatase in a separate aqueous phase occluded therein, and incorporating antigenic lipopolysaccharide from E.coli 0149 in the liposome structure. a E. coli 0149 K91 L16 Abbotstown strain commercially available or an equivalent strain of the well mo n S. coli 0149 is grown on 100 ml of BAB culture medium 4 O.1 glucose w v in Roux flasks for 48 hours at 37 C. The resultant bacterial lawn is scraped off the surface in about 2 ml saline per flask and the flasks washed in saline before autoclaving at 1210 and 15 psi. The autoclaved preparations are centrifuged and a clear supernatant rich in lipopoly saccharide is preparated, and conncentrated to one tenth volume by dialysis against polyethylene glycol 20E grade .The pellet from the centrifugation is extracted into an equal volume of phenol water 90 10 v v and is dialysed successively against water to remove phenol and polyethylene glycol to concentrate . The two lipopolysaccharide concentrates are pooled, heate at 560C in 0.5M NaOH for 1 hour, returned to pH 7 with HCl and dialysed 18 hours against water, before freeze drying in the presence of 0 1 glucose as cryopreservative. For incorporation in liposomes this lyophilisate is taken up at the rate of 5 mg ml in citrate or other suitable buffer and sonically disrupted to give a slightly opalescent solution. Equivalent preparations of lipopolysaccharide can be used if desired. b lipids and aqueous material containing lipopolysaccharide e.g. from the preparation described above together with the enzyme to be occluded aLkaline phosphatase, e.g. Sigma TypeVII Trade Mark , about 1 1 w w in relation to the lipopolysaccharide in standardised activity are used in the ratio 1 m mole total lipid to 50 ml aqueous material.The lipids used are agg yolk lecithin, cholesterol and L alphy phospha tidylethanolamine molar ratio 7 2 1 dissolved in chloroform at respective concentrations 11.2 mg ml, 1.6 mg ml, 0115 mg ml. The mixed chloroform solution is evaporated under reduced pressure at 500C to form a film of solid in the containing vessel, which is then suspended in a volume ofO.1M bicarbonate buffer pE 7.2 equal to that of the chloroform removed, also containing 0.25 null alkaline phosphatase, 0.24 mg ml lipopolysaccharide 0149 and 4.2 mg ml sodium deoxycholate. The milky suspension firs obtained is ultrasonically disrupted at 0 4 C until it becomes translucent. At this time the suspension contains mixed micelles of lipid and deoxycholate. To produce liposomes the deoxycholate is removed by gel filtration on crosslined arose Sepharose 43 Trade Mark the liposomes appear in the eluate close to the void volume. Inaccessibility to substrate of the occluded enzyme in the product liposomes can be verified by testing aliquots of the liposome preparation 0.1 ml with 1 .1 of p5 9.8 carbonate buffer containing chromogenic substrate pnitrophenyl phosphate 1 mg ml, in respective tests in the absence and in the presence of a lytic agent and liberating agent for the occluded phase, detergent Triton X 100 0 1 w v . The eluate fractions showing highest activity in the presence of detergent are pooled.In the absence of lytic agent only low background levels of enzyme activity are seen This or equivalent preparations of liposomes having enzyme occluded therein and bearing antigen on their surfaces lipopolysaccharide can be used for assays according to the invention. The liposome preparation described here is found on electron microscopic examination under negative staining to comprise particles of average size about 1500 angstrons, composed of one or a few bilayers with large internal spaces.Preparation 2 liposomes having material of another immunological specificity than that of lipopolysaccharide of E.coli i.e. of any desired specificity , bound to their surfaces can be made by the following procedure. Rabbit or sheep antibody specific for E.col 0O lipopolysaccharide is obtained as the IgG fraction of pooled immune rabbit or sheep sera showing high titre antibody activity against the lipopolysaccharide after immunisation in the normal way. Sheep antibody specific for human alpha fetoprotein is obtained in conventional manner also commercially available, from Seward Laboratory, UAC House, BlackfriersRoad, London SEI, England, under code BN516 nephelometric grade . The anti E.coli 0149 is coupled with the anti human alpha fetoprotein in the following way. Anti E.coli 0149 globulin fraction 6 mg ml is reacted for several hours at room temperature with 20 mg ml entyl N carbamyl cyanomethyl l iminoacetate and dialysed against saline buffer pH 7.2. The resulting antibody solution derivatised with a substituted 2 amino 1 imidazoly group is diazotised at 4 C by the successive addition with mixing of 1.5 volumes of 0.4 aqueous NaNO2, 1.5 volumes of N aqueous 1101 and 1.5 volumes of 2 aqueous ammonium sulphamate.After 20 seconds subsequent reaction at 4 C the diazonium product is added dropwise to an excess of sheep anti human alpha fetoprotein in pH 407 buffered saline 10 mg ml at 40C, controlling the falling pE to its original value with N aqueous NaOH, and after 10 minutes raising the pit to 7.2. After several hours storage at 40C and centrifugation, the supernatant containing coupled protein product is taken and stored at 200C till further use. One volume of the coupled protein product about 5 mg ml , and one volume of the liposome preparation of Preparation 1, are mixed at room temperature 30 minutes, and treated by gel fltration over cross linked agarose Sepharose 43 . Close to the void volume tbere are eluded fractions containing the product, liposomes as of Preparation I having bound thereto coupled complexes of anti E.coli 0149 anti human alpha fetoprotein . Uncoupled proteins are separated by the gel filtration and emerge in later eluate. These are suitable for the assay of human alpha fetoprotein.Instead of the anti human alpha fetoprotein there can be used in the preparation other antibodies or antigens, such as for example sheep anti human IgM Fc or sheep anti human pregnancy associated alpha 2 glycoprotein in which case tne resulting product is useful in assays with the corresponding specificity, or the antibody can be substituted with antigen such as, for example, purifird human alpha fetoproteln itself, in which case the product is suitable for use in alternative assay configurations as described above, corresponding to this specificity. Preparation 3 An alternative procedure for preparing liposomes having material of any desired immunological specilicity bound to their surfaces is as follows. Gne volume of the liposome suspension obtained byPreparation 1 is reacted with an equal volume of 0.25 w v glutaraldehyde in 0.lN bicarbonate buffer pR 7.2 for 10 minutes at room temperature and dialysed against O.1N bicarbonate pH 7.2 for several hours to remove unreacted glutaraldehyde completely.At this point the liposomes bear free aldehyde groups on their surfaces, at the distal end of substituents derived by condensation of one aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde with the ethanolamine amino group of each reacted phosphatidylethanolamine molecule of the liposdmes. The activated liosoiaes are incubated at room temperature 24 hours with 0.1 mg ml of the protein of desired immunological specificity to be coupled thereto, e.g sheep anti human alpha fetoprotein , human alpha fetoprotein itself, or sheep anti human lgE or other desired antigen or antibody.Finally, excess activation of the llposomes is removed by dialysis of the product against bicarbonate buffer pF 7.2 containing 0.1N ethanolamine for several hours and the product liposomes bearing coupled reagent of the desired specificity are separated by gel filtration on cross linked agarosde Sepharose 43 , eluting the product close to the void volume identified by assaying aliquots with phosphatase substrate and detergent This product contains immunologically active reagent covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine molecules of the liposome. Preparation 4 An alternative procedure for preparing liposomes having immunoglobulin G bound to their surfaces is as follows. The protein A from Staphylococcus aureus which has a bindinh avidity for immunoglobulin G is obtained in know manner and coupled to liposomes loaded with alkyline phosphatase in the manner described in Preparations 1 and n above The protein A is used as the protein to be coupled to the aldehyde activated liposomes. The so treated liposomes in pH 8.5 buffer, 0.1M bicarbonate are mixed with an excess on a protein coupled protein molar basis, e.g 0.1 mg protein per mi of liposome preparation with immunoglobulin G and incubated for several hours up to about a day at room temperature.A tenfold weight excess based on the immuno globulin of dimethyl suberimidate its gradually added to the mixture and if necessary the pH is readjusted to pH 8.5.After 30 minutes at room temperature the mixture is dialysed overnight against carbonate buffer containing out ethanolamine, and separated from low molecular weight reagents and unlinked protein by elution from Sepharose 4B as described inPreparations 1 to 3. The product has immunoglobulin G of the chosen specificity covalently bound to the liposome by a protein A bridging group linked covalently both to the immunoglobulin and to the phosphatidylethanolamine molecule of the liposome by glutaraldehyde derived and suberimidate derived links respectively, and is useful for assay according to this invention for an analyte corresponding to the specificity of the immunoglobulin used.Preparation 5 An alternative method of preparing liposomes bearing lipopolysaccharide applicable for use also in Preparations 2 to 4 above is as follows Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 83 micromole, 65 mg is dissolved in each 7.5 ml of isopropyl ether and each 2ml methanol at 45 C. For each 9.5 ml combined solvent, 2.5 ml of phosphate buffered s9olution containing 0.5 mg lipopoly saccharide e.g. prepared as described above end 2.5 mg alkaline phosphatase was added The mixture is throughly disrupted ultrasonically acubt 15 minutes at 45 C.During rotary evaporation at 45 C the material norms a semi solid gel, at which point 4 or for each original 20 ml of feed to the evaporator phosphate buffered saline is added and the evaporation continued 60 minutes more. Finnaly the residual 5 ml suspension for each 4 ml saline added is subjected to gel filtration Sepharose 4B and liposomes containing occluded enzyme detected and harvested from the void volume eluate as described before.Preparation 6 Antibodies or antigens can be formed into immunosorbents by linkage to nylon surfaces via glutaraldehyde to give products which can accept the specific binding of suitably activated liposomes, by the following method. Nylon cups 7 mm by 9 mm diameter, e.g. shaped as standard microtiter trays, or as individual cups, are filled with 3.5M 1101 and incubated at 500C for 1 hour to expose free amino groups by hydrolysis. After thorough washing in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2 the cups are filled with glutaraldehyde solution in distilled water 12.5 v v , chilled to 40 to 600. After 30 minutes at 40 to 700 and thorough washing in phosphate buffered saline, an antibody or antigen to be coupled and itself having free amino groups is added to the cups as a solution at 0.02 to 3 mg ml concentration and incubated there 16 to 18 hours at 37 C.The buffer for this stage e.g. p11 7.2 phosphate saline must be free of any amino compounds capable of competing with the material to be coupled. After the coupling reaction the immunosorbent is prepared for use by washing in plain buffer, and blocking of any residual activated coupling groups by exposure to ethanoklamine 1.5H as the chloride ph 8.5 withHCl for 1 hour at 37 C, followed by further washing in plain Cr. The following Examples further illast7 ate the invention in conjunction with the description given hereinabove. Example 1 1 Materials according to an example o his Invention, suitable for the immunoassay of human alpha fetoprotein, can be prepared as follows. A preparation of liposomes having alkaline phosphatase occluded therein, and bearing immunological valency with the specificity anti human alpha fetoprotein coupled to their surface, is prepared according to Preparations 1, 3 and 4 above using anti human alpha fetoprotein obtainable from Seward taboratory as the immunoglobulin G used inPreparation 4 . The preparation is kept free of detergent and made 1 w v with purified ovalbumin. An immunoadsorbent is prepared according to Preparation 6, again using anti human alpha fetoprotein as the antibody to be coupled.The remaining materials required for the assay are a lytic agent, in this case 0.1 w v Triton X 100 detergent, and phosphate substrate obtainable commercially as watersoluble pellets, which are dissolved in water before use.Assay is carried out by filling each of a set of similarlyprepared immunoadsorbent cups with dilutions of analyte samples suspected of containing alpha fetoprotein, dilutions of standard solutions of alpha fetoprotein including saturation and null controls , all free of detergent and made 1 w v in ovalbumin purified . After standardised 30 minute exposures of cups to samples at 37 C, the analyzes are replaced by aliquots of the liposome preparations as described above, and again incubated 30 minutes at 37 C.The cups are then thoroughly washed in pR 7.2 buffer containing 1 w v purified ovalbumin and then exposed to detergent solution in pH 9.8 carbonate buffer 0.1M . After 2 minutes the detergent solution is transferred to a spectrophotometer cuvette and substrate solution added. The rate of measurable colored product formation pnitrophenol 5 taken as the assay result from each cut. Calibration of the assay is obtained from the series of standard dilutions. 2 The assay for altha fetoprotein given above can be adapted for use as an assay for human chorionic gonado trophin as follows. Assay materials are provided as a li.some preparation made as described above in Preparations 1 5 and 4 above, using anti human chorionic gonadotrophin as the immunoglobulin G in Preparation 4. The preparation was kept free of detergent and made 1 with purified ovalbumin An immunoadsorbent is prepared according to Preparation 6, using human chorionic gonadotrophin as the antigen to be coupled to the solid support. The remaining assay materials used are as in Part 1 above. However, in this case a limited standardised quantity of the vesicle preparation is used after quantitation of its binding capacity for human chorionic gonadotrophin by standard method.The limited quantity chosen is in excess of. the highest concentration at lowest dilution of interest in the assay. The materials are used for assay by exposing the standardised aliquots of vesicles bearing anti humaa chorionic gonadotrophin to dilutions of the analyte possibly containing the hormone of interest, to dilutions of standard solutions of it, and to saturation and null controls. After 2 hours at 370C the reaction mixtures are transferred to the immunoadsorbent cups and incubated for a further 2 hours at 37 C. Then the liquid phase is removed from each cup. Either the removed liquid in this case or the remaining well surface can be treated with detergent to release enzyme from the liposomes, and treated to establish corresponding calibration curves and assay results in the usual way.Where the removed liquid is used, the coloured product quantity directly related to the amount of analyte present, and wnere tne enzyme released from the immunoadsorbed liposomes is used, the quantity of coloured product is inversely related to the amount of analyte present. Example 2 This Example illustrates materials for the immunoadsorbent immunoassay using enzyme loaded liposomes in their most simple form. In summary, liposomes filled with an occluded aqueous preparation of alkaline phosphatase and bearing on their surface alkali treated lipopolysaccharide extracted fromE.coli, serotype 0149, were suspended in a solution of ovalbumin in phosphate buffered saline PBS and placed in 300 ul polystyrene wells. The inside walls of the wells had been coated with rabbit derived antibodies to E.coli 0149 organisms. After 90 minutes incubation the wells had been thoroughly rinsed with ovalbumin 1 in PBS and were then filled with a buffered solution of substrate and detergent. After a further 90 minutes incubation the enzyme substrate reaction was stopped and the opticai densities of the solutions were measured.The system is used for assay by introducing analyte and optionally substituting alternative immunological specificities as described in 1 5 below. The lipopolysaccharide LPS was prepared as follows Batches of E coli, serotype 0149, K.91 were cultured in 100 ml lots of blood agar No. . 2 Oxoid containing 0. 2 glucose for 48 hours at 37 C. The cells were removed from the surf ace by the addition of 2 ml saline 0.85 and sweeping of the surface with a glass rod. The cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed in saline and then suspended in 0.5 formalin for 15 hours. The formaldehyde was removed by dialysis against distilled later. Lipopolysaccharide was extracted from these killed bacteria by treatment with 90 phenol in water. This was carried out by suspending the killed bacteria in 50 ml of water and mixing this with 50 ml of 9 o phenol in waver. After being heated at 68 C for 5 15 minutes the mixture was cooled and the top water layer was separated and recovered. This layer was rather thick and had retained much insoluble cell debris it was necessary to filter i through WhatmanNo. 1 filter fciPCD before it could be freed of dissolved phenol by dialysis. The IPS extract was then treated with alkali, to increase its critical micelle concentration CMC , and so increase its ability to insert into liposome membranes. The suspension was mixed with an equal volume of N sodium hydroxide solution and heated at 5600 for 1 hour Finally, the extract was neatralised and then dialysed against 0.1 glucose in distilled water in preparation for freeze drying. The antibodies were obtained as follows The antibodies used were in the form of IgG fractions from the sera of rabbits immunised with E.coli 0149. TheIgG fractions were prepared from whole sera by 1 double precipitation with sodium sulphate to 1 l6 o and 2 subsequent ion exchange chromatography on Whatman DE.52 cellulose. The immunosorbent was produced as follows Immunosorbent surfaces were prepared by attaching rabbit anti 0149 antibodies onto the inside walls ofDynatech polystyrene Removawells . This was achieved by simply filling the wells with antibody solution in pE 9.8 carbonate buffer at a total protein concentration of 5 g per ml, and incubating them in a sealed container at 37 C overnight. The enzyme filled, antigen sensitised liposomes were prepared as follows liposomes were prepared from a lipid mixture containing lecithin 16.t2 mg , chlesterol 5.80 mg and dicetyl phosphate 1.20 mg giving a molar ratio of 2 1.5 0.22.The molar quantity Of lecithin used for this preparation o liposomes was 20 u moles. Alkali treated LPS 120 g and alkaline phosphatase 1,500 g were included In the aqueous suspending fluid to provide sensitising antigen and marker enzyme. Firstly, the lipid components ware dissolved in 25 ml of chloroform and were deposited on the inside surface of a 100 ml round bottom flask, by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure at 40 C. Last traces of solvent were removed by placing the flask under high vacuum for 1 hour The dried lipid film was suspended in a 2 ml solution of IPS 120 ug and alkaline phosphatase Sigma Type VII, 1,500 ug in PBS.To facilitate dispersion of the lipids, the mixture was agitated by means of t Whirlimix VortexMixer and the milky white suspension was left to stand overnight at 4 C. In the preparation of the aqueous suspending medium it was necessary to dissolve LPS in a standard, stock solution by taking up 5 mg of the freeze dried material in 1 ml of distilled water and subjecting this to sonication until it was only slightly opalescent. Of this stock solution, 24 ml were to the aqueous susoending medium to give the required quantity of 120 ug, Free unentrapped enzyme was removed from the suspension by chromatography on Sepharose 43.The liposomes eluted from the column in the void volume but free enzyme was retained and came out in later fractions, To confirm the presence of trapped enzyme in these liposomes a 5 ul sample was mixed with substrate solution nitro phenyl phosphate, 1 mg ml. in carbonate buffer, pR 9.8 and the amount of product formation after one hour was . measured in terms of the optical density OD at 400 nm.A second sample was set up in an identical system but in the presence of 1 Triton 135. In the absence of Triton X 100 there was only a very slight development of colour, but in its presence there was an intense colour development after only a few minutes incubation, so indicating the entrapment of a large amount of enzyme see Table 1 .

An appropriately diluted sample of the liposome suspension was placed in each well and they were incubated at 37 C for 90 minutes. The sample volume added in each case was 50 ul. After the first indubation, the wells were emptied and then washed twice in. 1 ovalbumin in PBS. The substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mg ml was dissolved in carbonate buffer pit 9.8 containing 1 Triton X 100 and this was placed into each well at the rate of 250 ul per well. After another 90 minutes incubation the enzume reaction was stopped by the addition of l of 2N sodium hydroxide and the optical densities at 400 nm were recorded. The results obtained from the specific binding assay show t at liposomes can be bound by immobilised antibodies, through ace membrane antigens. This binding is specific and is firm enoug to withstand a relatively vigorous rinsing process. The specificity is confirmed by the absence of binding, even when a non specific protein i.e.ovalbumin is included in the sample, thus precluding the possibility of non specific adsorption of liposomes onto a layer o adsorbed protein at the polystyrene water interface. Finally, the enzyme activity detected In those wells bearing antibodies to 0149 IWS can only be attributed to the binding of liposomes through their surface IPS. The release of this activity upon incubation with substrate and detergent confirms that such bound liposomes can be made to yield their contents quantitatively, as needed. It is apparent that the test materials described above immunosorbent, and liposomes bearing antigenic lipopolysaccharide , are applicable in immunoassay according to the procedures described above, in any of several forms, for example as follows. 1 Antibody against E.coli 0149 or its lipopolysaccharide can be assayed by exposing aliquots of the liposomes bearing the lipopolysaccharide to contact with the antibody under assay before placement in the wells Any antibody present in the material under assay depresses the extent of adherence of liposomes to the well walls. Detection of the vesicles and estimation of their amount is carried out by detergent lysis, exposure to substrate, and optical measurement, as described above. Control and calibration are performed in the usual way. 2 E. coli 0149 or its native lipopolysacchyride can be assayed by contacting the material under assay with the immuno adsorbent well walls coated with antibody before or during exposure of the immunosorbent to the liposomes. Any antigen present in the material under assay depresses the extent of adherence of liposomes to the well walls. Detection and estimation are carried out as before. Control and calibrat on or are performed in the usual way. 3 Antibody against E.coli 01 9 or its lipopolysaccharide also be assayed using a modified immunosorbent in the system to give a sandwich technique. Instead of using antibody against E coli 0149 to coat the well walls, a heterologous anti immunoglobulin G or even better anti Fc globulin directed against the species from which the material under assay comes, can be used to coat the walls. The material under assay is then exposed first either to the liposomes, or to the well walls, or it is placed in the wells in admixture with the liposomes then the extent of adherence of liposomes to the well walls is directly related to the amount of anti E.coli 0149 present in the test material.Detection and estimation are carried out as before Control and calibration are performed in the usual way. 4 It is also apparent that the test materials described above can be applied to the Immunoassay of for example the human alpha fetoprotein mentioned above. In the manner described above, the preparation of liposomes or vesicles bearing the preparation of a bi functional complex consisting of antibody specific against E.coli 0149 or against its lipopolysaccharide, coupled as mentioned above using the coupling technique of GB Patent Specification No. 1,316,990, to a heterologous antibody raised against human alpha fetoprotein, e.g raised in the sheep.This fixes the bi functional complex on to the surface of the vesicles, and aliquots of the resulting preparation can be exposed to material under assay possibly containing human alpha fetoprotein, and to an immunosorbert as described above which is specific for alpha fetotrotein. The immunosorbent can be made by using an antibody to human alpha fetoprotein instead of the anti E.coli 0149 to coat the wells in the above described immunosorbent preparation. Then the extent of adherence of liposomes to the walls of the well is directly related to the amouht of human alpha fetoprotein in the material under assay Detection and estimation are carried out as described above.Control and calibration are performed in the usual way. 5 ft is apparent that all the immunosorbents described above in this example can alternatively be made in the mRnn er described above by coupling the respective antibody r. th the surface of a nylon tube activated b acid hydrolysis and reacted with adipimidate reagent as described in GBSpecification No. 1,470,955 mentioned above . Thus far the invention has been described with reference to enzymes as the marker substances occluded within the vesicles. It is also possible to use alternative markers in place of the enzymes examples given without limitation are fluorochromes e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate, umbelliferone and its derivatives and other fluorescent substances , and radioisotopes, e.g. 125I, 51Cr. These substitutions can be severally made in each and every one of the embodiments of the test methods and materials described hereinabove with the achievement of satisfactory results. Where such substitutions are made, the substrate for the enzyme is of course omitted, and the released marker measured after exposure of the vesicles to the lytic agent if need be. Any marker substance, i.e. a substance capable of being occluded in the vesicles in place of the enzymes first described herein, can be used instead. Such occlusion of marker substances in the vesicles enables achievement of a high ratio of marker to binding reagent or its binding partner in conjunction with releasability and the ease of handling conferred by the use of solidphase reagents. Numerous further modifications and variations can be made within the scope of the above described invention
