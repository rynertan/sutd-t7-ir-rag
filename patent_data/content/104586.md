# Gas burner control system.

## Abstract
A gas burning furnace 10 has a burner 13 in which the premixed fuel air ratio of the burned gas in the burner flame 23 is measured by a flame rod 22 sensing the ionization current. The flame rod 22 is connected to a fuel air controller 24 which controls the gas 15 25 and primary air 20 to the burner to maintain the maximum flame ionization current which results in an excessive amount of gas to the burner 13 . Secondary air 31 is supplied to the combustion chamber to add sufficient oxidant in the combustion cham ber 11 to ensure complete combustion.
