# PROCESS FOR THE PHOTOCHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITIOM OF HETERO LINKED POLYMERS

## Abstract
A low temperature photochemical vapor deposition process for the deposition of a layer of a chosen polymer on the surface of a substrate. The polymer comprises repeating hydrocarbon units linked through oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms and is formed by reacting a vapor phase monomer precursor containing the hydrocarbon units and a vapor phase precursor containing the oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur under radiation inducement. The low temperature of the process avoids thermal damage to the substrate. Specifically disclosed polymers are polyphenylether and polyxylene amine, which are useful, respectively, as insulator or passi vation layers in semiconductor devices and circuits, and as adhesives.
