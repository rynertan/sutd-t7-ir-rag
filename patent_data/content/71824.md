# Preform structure.

## Abstract
A multilayered preform 20 is disclosed for making an open mouth container. The preform 20 has a container forming portion A comprising a circular central area for making the bottom of the container, an annular sidewall forming portion for the container surrounding and integral with the outer periphery of the central area, a flange 31 connected to the annular portion, said flange 31 having the contour of the rim of the container, said container forming portion A having a predetermined volume to meet dimen sional requirements, and a retaining member 26 having an enlarged portion. The preform 20 is an improved structure that is readily adaptable for making containers from the so called solid state pressure forming process.
