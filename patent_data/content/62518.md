# HEAT EXCHANGERS

## Abstract
1. A heat exchanger comprising a casing 1 , means 33 in the casing defining first and second fluid flowpaths, and a fluid inlet 42 and a fluid outlet 10, 31 associated with each of the said flowpaths, the said flowpath defining means including a plurality of substantially parallel flat plates 50, 51 , each of the said plurality of plates having a portion of its periphery 53 bent towards a first side of the plate, and an adjacent portion 55 of its periphery bent towards an opposite side of the said plate, the said peripheral portions of the plates serving to connect the plates to at least one adjacent plate 57 , each of the said plates including a notch 61 intermediate the said peripheral portions, and the heat exchanger including a sealing bar 58 accommodated in the notches 61 of the said plates for preventing mixing of the said first and second fluid flowpaths.
