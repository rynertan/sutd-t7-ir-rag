## Description
This invention relates to heat sensitive recording materials and more particularly to fixable heat sensitive recording materials. Heat sensitive recording materials are well known which are adapted to produce record images by thermally contacting a colorless basic dye with a color developing material to utilize color forming reaction occurring on contact of the color developing material with the dye. These conventional heat sensitive recording materials are designed to produce record images by being heated and therefore have the following drawback. Even after record images have been formed by application of heat, color forming reaction still takes place when they are inadvertently heated. As a result, the record images will become obscure or illegible owing to the coloration of the background portion thus heated. For this reason, the heat sensitive recording materials of this type are unfit for use in recording important information to be stored. In recent years, research is under way to develop fixable heat sensitive recording materials of the diazo type utilizing color forming reaction between a diazonium salt and a coupler. Generally heat sensitive recording materials of the diazo type include a recording layer formed on a substrate and having dispersed therein particles of a diazonium salt, a coupler and a color developing auxiliary capable of producing a base by being heated. On heating the recording layer of this type of heat sensitive recording material, the color developing auxiliary produces a base which causes color forming reaction diazo coupling reaction of the diazonium salt with the coupler to give record images. Thereafter the entire surface of the recording layer is irradiated with ultraviolet rays to decompose the unreacted diazonium salt in the unrecorded portion of the recording layer. The decomposition of the unreacted diazonium salt eliminates the possibility of color forming reaction occurring on application of heat, whereby the record images are fixed. Known color developing auxiliaries capable of producing a base when heated include substances producing a base on thermal decomposition such as organic or inorganic ammonium salts, urea and the like. However, since these substances gradually decompose even at ambient temperature, diazo coupling reaction between the diazonium salt and the coupler is caused during the storage of the recording material this reaction will be hereinafter referred to as precoupling , thereby giving rise to undesired coloration fogging of the recording layer. In the US A 3,389,995 a two component diazotype photoprinting material and a sensitizing composition for its preparation are described, comprising a surface having thereon a light sensitive layer containing an azo coupling component, a light sensitive diazonium compound, an acid stabilizer and at least one amidine compound selected from the group consisting of acetamidine, propionamidine, butyramidine, dicyandiamidine, guanyl thiourea and salts thereof. The object of this patent is to provide heat developable light sensitive diazotype material containing an alkali generating substance the material being stable for extended periods of storage and has a much smaller tendency to degrade the paper base. It has been found, however, that this known photoprinting material does not display a satisfactory color density of the record image and an acceptable background color density at the same time. It has been also proposed to use, as such color developing auxiliary, a substance capable of producing a basic atmosphere by being thermally fused, such as guanidine derivatives and aliphatic amines, e.g., stearyl amine. The use of these substances, how ever, results also in occurence of precoupling during storage especially under humid conditions and consequently in coloration fogging of the recoding layer. It is an object of the present invention to provide heat sensitive recording materials of the diazo type which can exhibit excellent storage stability over a prolonged period of time without causing precoupling. It is another object of the present invention to provide heat sensitive recording materials of the diazo type which have a sensitivity sufficient to form sharp color and which can form record images of satisfactory color density. These objects and other features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description.

By the use of at least one of the foregoing heat fusible basic compound of the formula Ia or Ib serving as a color developing auxiliary, the heat sensitive recording materials of the present invention can exhibit outstanding storage stability over a prolonged period of time without causing precoupling and without having the recording layer colored during storage even under humid conditions. The heat sensitive recording materials of the present invention have a further advantage of being free from undesired coloration of the recording layer which otherwise would take place immediately after production of the recording material. Moreover, the heat sensitive recording materials of the present invention can form color of high density with satisfactory sensitivity and therefore can produce sharp record images.

The proportions of the diazonium salt and the coupler used in the present invention can be adequately decided depending on their kinds. Generally about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight of the coupler is used per part by weight of the diazonium salt. According to the present invention, the substrate is coated with a heat sensitive recording layer containing at least one species each of the diazonium salts, couplers and the specific heat fusible basic compounds exemplified above. To form the recording layer, a coating composition comprising these components is prepared and applied to the substrate in one layer. Alternatively, one or two of these components and the rest thereof are each made into coating compositions, and the coating compositions are applied to the substrate in superposed layers, thereby providing the desired recording layer. In formulating the coating composition, the diazonium salt coupler and heat fusible basic compound of the formula Ia Ib are dispersed in water separately or at the same time. These components may also be separately or conjointly dispersed or dissolved in an organic solvent to prepare a coating composition, so far as color forming reaction is not caused during preparation and application of the coating composition. The dispersing operation is performed with use of a stirring or pulverizing device such as a ball mill, attritor, sand mill and the like. Examples of the organic solvent are ethanol, benzene, toluene, n hexane, ethyl acetate, etc. The coating composition generally includes as a binder a water soluble or water insoluble adhesive such as starches, casein, gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate emulsion, SBR latex, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer and the like in an amount of about 5 to about 30 by weight, preferably about 10 to about 25 by weight, based on the total weight of the solids in the recording layer.

The coating composition is applied in an amount of about 3 to about 10 g m² based on the dry weight and the coating is dried. The heat sensitive recording materials of the present invention thus prepared can exhibit outstanding storage stability over a prolonged period of time free of precoupling during storage which would occur in conventional heat sensitive recording materials of the diazo type. In the same manner as with the conventional heat sensitive recording materials, record images are produced on the heat sensitive recording material of the invention with a thermal pen or a thermal head. Then the entire surface of the recording layer is irradiated with ultraviolet rays using a fluorescent lamp or mercury lamp to decompose the unreacted diazonium salt in the unrecorded portion of the recording layer, whereby the record images are fixed.
