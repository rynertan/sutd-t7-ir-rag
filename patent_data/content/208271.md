# Vacuum interrupter.

## Abstract
A cylindrical coil electrode 10 incorporated in a vacuum interrupter comprises a cylindrical body 12 having an open ing at one end thereof, two electrical connections 16, 17 pro vided between the end edge surface of the opening of the cylindrical body and a main electrode 11 , two arcuate slits 20, 21 formed on the cylindrical body 12 between the two electrical connections 16, 17 , two arcuate current paths 22, 23 formed in the cylindrical body by the arcuate slits 20, 21 and connected to one end thereof to the electrical connections respectively and to the other end thereof to a rod 7 , and two current blocking slits 26 29 formed between one end and the other end of the cylindrical body 12 at positions where one end 24 of each of the current paths 22 laps the other end 25 of the other current path 23 . Because of the above structure, one turn current flows throughout the current paths 22, 23 so that a uniform axial magnetic field H can be app lied to the main electrode 11 , and an arc current can be uni formly distributed over the entire surface of the main elect rode, thereby improving the current interruption performance of the vacuum interrupter.
