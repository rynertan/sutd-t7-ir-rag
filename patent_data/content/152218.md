# METHOD OF PRODUCING A FILLED POTATO AND THE PRODUCT THEREBY OBTAINED

## Abstract
A method of producing a filled potato comprises remov ing an elongated core from the potato and inserting therein a pre formed, flavour containing cartridge. For example, the potato may be at least partially baked before the core is removed and a range of cores of different flavour may be available for insertion in the potato when the filled potato is required.
