# Apparatus for and method of enlarging character pattern.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an apparatus for and a method of enlarging character patterns. A fundamental character pattern representative of a character to be enlarged and composed of a dot matrix is produced, wherein the character is represented by vertical strokes, horizontal strokes and strokes oriented at an angle of 45 DEG with respect to the vertical and horizontal strokes. A square pattern composed of four adjacent dot elements is formed in accordance with each enlarging dot element of the fundamental character pattern. An enlarged partial pattern is read out of a storage device into which all kinds of enlarged partial patterns have previously been stored. Each enlarged partial pattern in the storage device is predetermined in accordance with the corresponding square pattern and magnifying rate. The enlarged partial patterns read out of the storage device are combined together so that an enlarged character pattern is formed.
