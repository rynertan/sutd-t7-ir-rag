# Method and apparatus for controlling air fuel ratio in an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine wherein feedback con trol of the air fuel ratio is carried out in accordance with the concentration of a specific composition in the exhaust gas, so that the air fuel ratio is close to an aimed air fuel ratio on the lean side with respect to the stoichiometric air fuel ratio, the rate of fuel cut off time for a definite time period is calculated. When the rate of fuel cut off time is larger than a predeter mined value, the air fuel feedback control is stopped.
