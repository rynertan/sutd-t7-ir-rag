## Description
TRI STATE DRIVER CIRCUIT FOR AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT Background of the InventionField of the Invention This invention relates generally to electronic circuits used in automatic test equipment, and relates more particularly to a tri state driver circuit for selectively driving a node of a device under test by applying and switching between two reference voltages, and for selectively operating at a high impedance output state.Description of the Prior Art In automatic test equipment used for testing electronic circuits, electronic signals are generated and applied to selected input pins of the device under test.The condition of the output pins of the device under test is then detected and compared with a desired condition to determine the functionality or quality of the circuit. The circuit within the automatic test equipment which drives the pins of the device under test is commonly referred to as the driver circuit. Because of the wide variety of electronic circuits which must be tested using the same test equipment, it is desirable for the automatic test equipment to be flexible in permitting the high speed switching of a wide range of voltages onto the input pins of the device under test.Accordingly, the driver circuits for such test equipment must generate output signals with a wide range of voltages and rapidly switch these voltages onto the input pins of the device under test. Prior art test equipment typically could supply output signals at small voltage swings of perhaps one or two volts between high and low voltages, or at large voltage swings of perhaps ten volts, but not both.Prior art test equipment has, thus, been unable to rapidly switch driving signals over a range that includes both small and large voltage swings. Summary of the Invent ion In accordance with the illustrated preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a tri state driver circuit for selectively driving a node of a device under test by applying and switching between two reference voltages, and for selectively operating at a high impedance output state. The circuit is divided into two portions a level selector for selection of one of the two reference voltages, and a buffer and tri state switch for driving an output signal at the voltage selected by the level selector and, alternatively, for switching the circuit to the high impedance state. The circuit of the present invention is particularly adapted for use in automatic test equipment for the testing of electronic circuits in which a wide range of voltages must be switched at high speeds onto the input pins of a device under test. The level selector portion of the tri state driver circuit includes several current sources, a diode bridge, a current switch, a current sink, and a feedback circuit.First and second current sources provide a bridge current that flows through the diode bridge to establish, at first and second nodes of the diode bridge, voltages that are equal to the two reference voltages. The diode bridge includes resistors across which the bridge current is switched to accommodate small voltage swings, and also includes clamp diodes to accommodate large voltage swings.Third and fourth current sources respectively supply to and receive from the diode bridge a constant current which limits the maximum value of the bridge current. When the bridge current is less than the constant current, output signals with small voltage swings are generated, and, alternatively, when the bridge current equals the constant current, output signals with large voltage swings are generated. The current switch is coupled to the diode bridge for controlling the direction of the bridge current according to the selected reference voltage. When the bridge current flows from right to left across the diode bridge, a voltage equal to the higher of the two reference voltages appears at the first node. Conversely, when the bridge current flows from left to right, a voltage equal to the lower of the two reference voltages appears at the first node. Currents from the first and second current sources flow through the diode bridge and the current switch to the current sink, which monitors the average voltage of the diode bridge and adjusts it to equal the average of the two reference voltages.The feedback circuit monitors the higher voltage at the two nodes of the diode bridge and adjusts it to equal the higher of the two reference voltages by controlling the currents supplied by the first and second current sources. The buffer and tri state switch portion of the tristate driver circuit includes a switch controller and an active transistor diode bridge. When the switch controller supplies a current to one node of the transistordiode bridge and receives an equal current from another node, the transistor diode bridge operates as a unity gain buffer. As a buffer, four diodes of the transistor diode bridge are forward biased and conductive, and four emitter follower transistors generate an output signal that is equal in voltage to that of the first node of the level selector. When the high impedance output state is selected, the switch controller reverses the directions of the currents applied to the nodes of the transistor diode bridge.This current reversal acts to reverse bias the diodes of the transistor diode bridge, which causes the output of the tri state driver circuit to be at the high impedance state.

Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a level selector portion of the tri state driver circuit of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of a transistordiode bridge utilized in the tri state driver circuit ofFigure 1. Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of a switch controller that is coupled to the transistor diode bridge of Figure 3. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment The preferred embodiment of the present invention is a tri state driver circuit for generating an output signal for driving a device under test. The output signal alternates between two predetermined reference voltages.In addition, the tri state driver circuit is capable of switching to high impendance output state. Figure 1 illustrates the entire tri state driver circuit in functional block form, while Figures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate various portions of the circuit in schematic form. The circuits illustrated in Figures 2, 3t and 4 are coupled together in the manner indicated by notations on theFigures to form the complete tri state driver circuit of the present invention. The circuit of Figure 2 is a level selector circuit that switches one of two reference voltages, DRH and DRL, onto node A. The circuit of Figure 3 is a unity gain buffer and tri state switch which accepts the signal at node A and supplies an equal voltage output signal at node OUT. The circuit of Figure 3 is also capable of switching node OUT to a high impedance state.The circuit of Figure 4 provides various functions for the circuits of Figures 2 and 3, including selection of the high impedance output state. A description of the overall circuit operation will be provided below first in reference to Figure 1, followed by detailed descriptions of the circuits of Figures 2, 3, and 4. In reference to Figure 1, a tri state driver circuit according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown generally at 10. The several functional blocks to the left of node A comprise a level selector circuit 12, while the remaining functional blocks comprise a buffer and tri state switch 14. The level selector circuit 12 selects one of the two reference voltages, DRH and DRL, and generates a voltage at node A equal to the selected reference voltage. Inputs DIII. and DIIL control the selection process. Input ON determines whether the buffer and tri state switch supplies an output voltage equal to the selected reference voltage at OUT, or switches to a high impedance output state at OUT.Inputs VCHI and VCLO are clamp voltages that define the allowable output range of the buffer when the high impedance output state is selected. The level selector circuit 12 establishes, at first node A and at second node B, voltages that equal the two reference voltages, DRH and DEL. First and second current sources 16 and 18 respectively supply first and second currents to nodes A and B. The first and second currents are substantially equal. A diode bridge 20 and a current switch 22 are connected in parallel across nodes A and B.A portion of the first or second current, equal to a bridge current, flows through the diode bridge. The direction of flow of the bridge current is selected by the current switch in response to inputs DRI. and DHL . Third and fourth current sources 24 and 26 respectively supply to and receive from the diode bridge a constant current which limits the maximum value of the bridge current. The direction of flow of the bridge current through the diode bridge 2Q determines which of the two reference voltages is established at node A. When the bridge current flows from node A to node B across the diode bridge, the voltage at node A is equal to DRS and the voltage at node B is equal to DRL. Conversely, when the bridge current flows from node B to node Aacross the diode bridge, the voltage at node A is equal to DRI. and the voltage at node B is equal to DRE. The current switch 22 controls the direction of the bridge current by controlling the amount of current flowing through lines 28 and 30. The voltages at nodes A and B are determined by a current sink circuit and by a feedback circuit. Both the current sink circuit and the feedback circuit monitor the voltages at nodes D and E. To prevent loading of the diode bridge circuit, two unity gain buffers 32 and 34 are respectiveti coupled to nodes D and E and respectively supply equivalent voltages at nodes G and H. The current sink circuit includes a fifth current source 36 coupled to current switch 22, a voltage divider 38 connected between nodes G and H, and a sink controller 40 that is coupled to both the fifth current source and the voltage divider. The fifth current source 36 acts as an adjustable current drain for the first and second currents that pass through the current switch.Voltage divider 38 forms a voltage that is equal to the average voltage at nodes D and E of the diode bridge. Sink controller 40 compares that average voltage to the average of DRE and DRL, and controls the current flowing thrÏug thefifth current source to cause the two average voltages to be equal. The feedback circuit monitors the higher of the voltages at nodes A and B and adjusts the first and second currents so that the higher voltage at node A or B equals the higher of the two reference voltages. The feedback circuit includes a bridge follower 42 that is connected between nodes G and H, a sixth current source 44 that drives the bridge follower, and a source controller 46 that is coupled to the first, second, and sixth current sources.Since the current of the sixth current source 44 is substantially equal to the first and second currents of the first and second current sources, and since the bridge follower 42 acts like the diode bridge, a voltage is established at node J that equals the higher of the two voltages at nodes A and B. Source controller 46 adjusts the first and second currents such that the voltage at nodeJ is equal to DRE. The buffer and tri state switch 14 is either on or off, depending upon whether an output or a high impedance output state is desired. When switch 14 is on, it operates as a buffer to supply an output voltage at node OUT equal to the voltage at node A. When switch 14 is off, it isolates the tri state driver circuit from the device under test by switching to the high impedance state. Included within the buffer and tri state switch is a transistor diode bridge 48 and a switch controller 50. Transistor diode bridge 48 serves as a unity gain buffer to drive node OUT at the same voltage as node A when switch 14 is on. Bridge 48 also serves to establish a high impedance output state at nodeOUT when switch 14 is off. The switch controller 50 supplies currents to bridge 48 according to the state of switch 14. Turning now to Figure 2, the level selector circuit 12 is shown in greater detail. The components and interconnections therebetween that form the level selector circuit will be described first, Then, the operation of the level selector circuit will be described. The first current source 16 includes a PNP transistor Q5 and resistor Rips. One end of resistor RIS is connected to the emitter of transistor Q5, and the other end of resistor RIS is connected to V2, which is a source of positive voltage. The collector of transistor Q5 is connected to node A for supplying the first current to the diode bridge 20. The second current source 18 includes a PNP transistor QZ and resistor RIO. One end of resistor RIO is connected to the emitter of transistor Q2, and the other end of resistor RIO is connected to V2. The collector of transistor Q2 is connected to node B for supplying the second current to the diode bridge 20. The base of transistor Q2 is connected to the base of transistor 05. Transistors Q2 and Q5 and resistors RIO and R15 are matched components so that the first and second currents are equal. The sixth current source 44 also includes a PNP transistor and resistor coupled to V2. One end of resistorR6 is connected to the emitter of transistor Q1, and the other end of resistor R6 is connected to V2. The collector of transistor Q1 is connected to node J for supplying a feedback current. The base of transistor Q1 is connected to the bases of transistors Q2 and Q5 and is also connected to one end of resistor R2 of source controller 46.Resistor R4 is connected between V2 and the common connection among the bases of transistors Q1, 02, and 05. Capacitor CS is connected between ground and V2, while capacitor C6 is connected between ground and the common connection among the bases of transistors Qlt Q2, and 05. The diode bridge 20 comprises four diodes CR3, Cur4, CR5, and CR6 and two resistors RIl and R16 disposed between nodes A first , B second , C third , D fourth , E fifth , and F sixth . Numbers in parentheses relate to the description of the nodes in the claims below . One end of resistor R16 is connected to node A and the other end is connected to node C. One end of resistor R11 is connected to nodee the other end is connected to node Z. The anode of diode CR3 is connected to node D and the cathode thereof is connected to node F.The anode of diode CR4 is connected to node F and the cathode thereof is connected to node B. The anode of diode CR5 is connected to node D and the cathode thereof is connected to node C. The anode of diode CR6 is connected to node C and the cathode thereof is connected to node E. The diode bridge also comprises bypass capacitors and RC filters coupled to nodes D and E. Capacitors C7 andC8 are respectively connected between ground and nodes D and E. Resistor R37 is connected at one end to node D and at the other end to ground through capacitor C2O. ResistorR38 is connected at one end to node E and at the other end to ground through capacitor C21. Third current source 24 supplies a constant current into node D. It comprises a PNP transistor, Qll, having a collector connected to node D, an emitter connected to the inverting input of an operational amplifier U2A, and a base connected to the output of operational amplifier U2A.Resistor R35 is connected between the inverting input ofU2A and positive voltage V2, while the non inverting input of U2A is connected to a voltage equal to V2 minus one volt. Due to the virtual short that exists between the two inputs of U2A, the voltage drop across resistor R35 is equal to one volt. Due to the high input impedance of U2A, substantially all of the current from V2 flows through transistor Qll and to node D. The third current source thus provides a constant current to node D. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the constant current may equal, for example, ten milliamperes. The fourth current source 26 operates in a fashion similar to the third current source and receives the same constant current from node E. It comprises an NPN transistor, Q12, having a collector connected to node E, an emitter connected to the inverting input of an operational amplifier U2B, and a base connected to the output of An28. Resistor XR36 is connected between the inverting input of U2B and a constant negative voltage V3, while the non inverting input of U2B is connected to a voltage equal to V3 plus one volt. Since the resistance of resistors R35 and R36 are equal, and since the voltage drop across resistors R35 and R36 are equal, the current flowing into node D from the third current source is equal to the current flowing out of node E to the fourth current source. The unity gain buffers 32 and 34 respectively drive nodes G seventh and H eighth at voltages respectively equal to nodes D and E. Buffer 32 is an operational amplifier U3A having a non inverting input connected to node D and an inverting input commonly connected to both the output of U3A and node G.

Current switch 22 provides a path for the first and second currents to flow to the fifth current source 36, as well as the means for controlling the direction of flow of the bridge current. Transistor QS controls the direction of flow of the first current from the first current source 16. Transistor QS is an NPN transistor having a collector connected to node A and having an emitter that is coupled to the fifth current source through a diode CR14. The emitter of transistor QS is also connected to a source of negative voltage V4 through resistor R65. Transistor Q3 controls the direction of flow of the second current from the second current source 18.Transistor Q3 is an NPN transistor having a collector connected to node B and having an emitter that is coupled to the fifth current source through a diode CR13. The emitter of transistor Q3 is also connected to V4 through resistor R64. The cathodes of both diodes CR13 and CR14 are connected in common to one end of resistor R13 of the fifth current source. Transistors Q21 and QZ2 provide switching control for transistors Q6 and 03. Transistor Q21 is a PNP transistor having a collector that is connected to the base of transistor QS through resistor R7. The base of transistor Q21 is connected to one end of a resistor network that includes resistor R42 connected between the base of Q21 and input DIlL, and resistor R43 connected between input DHL and a voltage source at negative two volts. The emitters of transistors Q21 and Q22 are commonly connected to one end of resistor R41r which is connected at the other end thereof to positive voltage source V2. Transistor QZ2 is also a PEP transistor and has a collector connected to the base of transistor Q3 through resistor R8. Resistor R5 is connected between the collectors of transistors Q21 and Q22, while the collector of Q21 is coupled to ground through capacitor C3.The base of transistor Q22 is connected to one end of another resistor network that includes resistor R44 connected between the base of Q22 and input DHL , and resistor R45 connected between input DHL and a voltage source at negative two volts. Voltage divider 38 provides a voltage at node I ninth that equals the average of the voltages at nodes G and H. The voltage divider includes two matched resistorsR4OA and R4OB, with resistor R4OA connected between node G and node I and resistor R4OB connected between node H and node I. Resistors R4OA and R4OB are matched in that the resistance values for each resistor are equal. Sink controller 40 uses the voltage at node I as well as the two reference voltages, DRH and DRI., to control the fifth current source 36. The sink controller includes an operational amplifier EIB having a non inverting input f connected to node I of the voltage divider. The inverting input of UlB is coupled to the Output of trIB through capacitor C2 and is connected to the center of a voltage divider formed by resistors R24A and R24B.Resistors R24A and R24B are matched resistors having the same resistance values. Resistor R24A is connected between the inverting input of UlB and DRH, while resistor R243 is connected between the inverting input of UlB and DRL. Thus, a voltage equal to the average of the two reference voltages is input to the inverting input of U1B. The output of UlB is coupled to the fifth current source through resistor R3. The fifth current source 36 receives the bulk of the current flowing through transistors Q3 and Q6 of the current switch 22. The fifth current source includes anNPN transistor with the collector thereof connected through resistor R13 to the common cathode connection of diodesCR13 and CR14. The emitter of transistor Q4 is coupled to V4 through resistor Rl4 and to ground through resistor R14 and capacitor C9. The base of transistor Q4 is driven by the output of operational amplifier UlB through resistorR3. Resistor R9 is connected between the base of transistor Q4 and voltage V4, while capacitor C4 is connected between the base of Q4 and ground. The bridge follower 42 acts like the diode bridge and allows the feedback circuit to monitor the voltages on the diode bridge without interfering with its operation.The bridge follower includes two diodes, CR1 and CR2, that are matched to diodes CR3, CR4, CR5, and CR6 of the diode bridge, and a resistor, R17, that is matched to resistor R16 of the diode bridge. Diode CR1 has an anode connected to node G and a cathode connected to node K eleventh , while diode CR2 has an anode connected to node K and a cathode connected to node H. Resistor R17 is connected between node K and node J tenth . The source controller 46 adjusts the flow of current through transistors Q1, Q2, and Os until the voltage at node J equals the higher of the two reference voltages. Source controller 46 includes an operational amplifier UlA having a non inverting input connected to node J, and an ou pu t 6nfl ted to the bases of transistors Q1, Q2, and Q5 through resistor R2. The inverting input of ULA is coupled to the output thereof through capacitor Cl, and is coupled to DRH through resistor RI. This completes the physical description of the level selector circuit 12. The operation of the level selector circuit 12 will be described first in relation to small voltage swings, and later in relation to large voltage swings. The difference in circuit operation between small and large voltage swings is in the operation of the diode bridge 20, otherwise the level selector circuit operates the same regardless of the size of the voltage swings. The current switch 22 controls the direction of the bridge current, and, therefore, controls the selection of whether the higher DRH or the lower DRI. reference voltage is to be found at node A. Inputs DIII. and DIIL are ECI. level inputs and control the current switch. To selectDRH, DIII. is set at a logic high level and DIIL is set at a logic low level. When DIII. is logic high and DELX is logic low, transistor Q22 is on and transistor Q21 is off. This causes transistor Q3 to be on and Q6 to be nearly off.Transistor Q6 is not turned completely off due to the presence of a small current flowing through its emitter and resistor R65. This small current keeps transistor Q6 partially on so as to allow it to more rapidly switch fully on at the desired time. With transistor Q3 on, the collector of Q3 receives a current from node B that equals the bridge current plus the second current from the second current source 18. This current is then passed through diode CR13 to transistor Q4 and then to negative voltage source V4. When transistor Q6 is nearly off, most of the first current supplied by the first current source 16 is forced to flow through resistor R16 and into the diode bridge.The portion of the first current that flows through resistor R16 and into the diode bridge equals the bridge current. If the bridge current is less than the constant current flowing through the diode bridge into node D and out of node E, then all of the diodes are forward biased.Any current that flows into node C causes a like current to TIow out of node F, because the currents into node 1 and out of node E are equal and fixed by the third and fourth current sources 24 and 26 and because the diode bridge can not store any current. Therefore, the bridge current that flows through resistor R16 also flows through resistor Rl1. All of the diodes of the diode bridge are forward biased when the difference between DRH and DRI. is a small voltage swing. The boundary between small and large voltage swings occurs when the difference between DRH and DRI. equals the total voltage drop across resistors RIl andR16 at a bridge current equal to the constant current. Thus, at small voltage swings, the bridge current is less than the constant current. When the level selector is operating at small voltage swings, the voltages at nodes C and F are approximately equal since they are both equal to the voltage at node D minus a diode drop. The voltage at nodeE is equal to the voltage at node C or node F minus a diode drop. For smaller and smaller swings, the voltages at nodes C and F become more equal until, at zero swing, the voltages are equal. Therefore, the average of the voltages at nodes C and F is equal to the average of the voltages at nodes D and B. The average of the voltages at nodes C and F and the average of the voltages at nodes D and E are also equal to the average of the voltages at nodes A and B. The voltage at node A is equal to the voltage at node C plus the voltage drop across resistor R16. In addition, the voltage at node B is equal to the voltage at node F minus the voltage drop across resistor RIl. Since the current through R16 equals the current through Rill, and the resistance of R16 equals the resistance of Rll t the voltage drop across RIl equals the voltage drop across R16.Therefore, the average ofwthe voltages at nodes C and F is equal to the average of the voltages at nodes A and B. When DRH is selected, the feedback circuit ensures that the voltage at node 3 equals DRH. The unity gain buffers 32 and 34 respectively hold the voltages at nodes G and H to be equal to the voltages at nodes D and E. In the preferred embodiment, the resistance value of resistor R15 is trimmed so that the voltage drop between nodes A and E equals the voltage drop between nodes 3 and H, which means, in effect, that transistor Ol outputs a feedback current through node J that equals the bridge current supplied by transistor OS to the diode bridge.Since buffer 34 keeps the voltage at node H equal to the voltage at node E, the voltage at node J equals the voltage at node A.Operational amplifier UlA compares the voltage at node J with DRIl and drives transistors Ol and Q5 to adjust the currents therefrom until the voltage at J equals DRIFT. Since the voltage at node A equals the voltage at node J, the voltage at node A is equal to DRH. Meanwhile, the current sink circuit ensures that the average voltage of the diode bridge is equal to the average of the two reference voltages. The voltage at nodeI in the voltage divider 38 is equal to the average of the voltages at nodes G and H. Buffers 32 and 34 respectively hold the voltages at nodes G and H to be equal to the voltages at respective nodes D and E. Therefore, the voltage at node I equals the average voltage at nodes D andE, and, at small swings with the diode bridge fully conductive, the voltage at node I also equals the average of the voltages at nodes C and F.The voltage at node I is compared to the average of DRH and DRI. by operational amplifier U1B. Operational amplifier EIB drives transistor Q4 to adjust the current flowing out of the current sink 36 until the voltage at I and the average of DRIl and DRI. are equal. Thus, the average of the voltages at nodesC and F is equal to the average of DRIl and DRL. Combining this with the knowledge that the average of the voltages at nodes C and F equals the average of the voltages at nodes A and B and that the voltage at node A equals DRH, one concludes that the voltage at node B is equal to DRL. When DRI. is selected for output, the reverse situation results with the voltage at node B equal to DRIl and the voltage at node A equal to DRL. When DRI. is selected, DHL is logic low and DRL is logic high, causing transistor Q21 to turn on and transistor Q22 to turn off.This in turn turns transistor Q6 on and transistor Q3 to be nearly off. Transistor Q3 stays partially on due to a slight current through resistor R64, for the same reasons that Q6 stays partially on when DRIl is selected. With transistor Q6 on when DRI. is selected, the entire amount of the first current from transistor Q5 flows through the collector of 06. In addition, most of the second current from transistor Q2 flows through resistor R11 and into the diode bridge, causing a like amount of current to flow from node C, through resistor Tri6, out node A and into the collector of transistor 06. In this case, however, the feedback circuit maintains the voltage at node B to be equal to DRE. In the preferred embodiment, the value of resistor RIO is trimmed so that the voltage drop between node B and node E, when DRI. is selected, is equal to the voltage drop between node J and node E. Since the voltage at node H equals the voltage at node E, the voltage at node L equals the voltage at nodeJ. In a fashion as described above, the feedback circuit adjusts the currents through transistors Ol and Q2 until the voltage at B equals DRE. The current sink operates as described above to hold the average voltage of the diode bridge to be equal to the average of DRE and DRL. Since the average of the voltages at nodes C and F equals the average of DRE and DRL, and the voltage at node B is equal to DM1, then the voltage at node A is equal to DRL. The average of the voltages at nodes C and F do not change when DEL is selected it remains equal to the average of DRE and DRL. In addition, the voltages at nodes D and E do not change when DEL is selected they remain constant at voltages respectively a diode drop above and a diode drop below the average of DRH and DRL. In switching from DRH to DEL, the magnitude of the briXgeq rrent does not change, just the direction. Consequently, the level selector switches from one output voltage to the other simply by changing the direction of the flow of the bridge current. In other words, the level selector switches a current the bridge current across a resistor RIl R16 to obtain small voltage swings. When large voltage swings are required, the diode bridge limits the current that is switched through resistors Ril and R16 and provides clamp voltages. The maximum amount of bridge current is equal to the constant current that the third and fourth current sources respectively supplies to and receives from the diode bridge. The amount of current flowing out of the diode bridge through node E comes to node E through diode CR4 and diode CR6. Assuming that DRE is selected, all of the bridge current that flows through resistor R16 flows to node E through diode CR6.If, for example, the constant current is equal to ten milliamperes and the bridge current is also equal to ten milliamperes, then all of the current that flows from node E comes through diode CR6 and none comes through diode CR4. In addition, all of the ten milliamperes supplied to node D by transistor Qll flows through diode CR3 to node F and then through resistor RIl to node B. Since no current flows through diodes CR4 and CR5, they are reversed biased and permit the voltages at nodes A, C, and E to be independent of the voltages at nodesB, D, and F. A similar result is obtained when DEL is selected.In such case, a bridge current equal to the constant current flows into node B from transistor Q2, then through resistor RIl to node F, and then through diode CR4 to nodeE. Also, the current from transistor Qll flows into nodeD, then through diode CR5 to node C, and then through resistor R16 to node A. In this case, diodes CR3 and CR6 are reverse biased and the voltages at nodes B, E, and F are independent of the voltages at nodes A, C, and D. Thus, when the level selector circuit operates at large voltage swings, the voltage at node D is independent of the voltage at node E, and the voltage at node A relates to either the voltage at node D or the voltage at node E, depending upon the direction of flow of the bridge current. The voltage that is established at node E is a clamp voltage for DRH. As described above, buffer 34 holds the voltage at node H to be equal to the voltage at node E.Also as described above, the voltage drop from node A to node E, when DRH is selected, is equal to the voltage drop fFom node J to node H. Operational amplifier UlA of the source controller adjusts the currents supplied by transistors Ol and Q5 so that the voltage at node 3 equals DRH, and, therefore, the voltage at node A equals DRE. When DEL is selected, the voltage drop from node B to node E is equal to the voltage drop from node J to node H, and operational amplifier UlA adjusts the currents supplied by transistors Ol and Q2 so that the voltage at node B equals DRH. When the level selector operates at large voltage swings, the bridge current is always equal to the constant current. Since the resistance of resistor RIl equals the resistance of resistor R16, and since the voltage drop across diode CR4 equals the voltage drop across diode CR6, the voltage at E is constant and equal to DRE minus a diode drop and minus the voltage drop across R16.The constant voltage at node E is thus a clamp voltage for DRff Correspondingly, the voltage that is established at node D is a clamp voltage for DRL. As described above, the current sink circuit maintains the voltage at node I to be equal to the average of DRE and DRL. Since buffers 32 and 34 respectively maintain the voltages at nodes G and H to be equal to the voltages at nodes D and E, and since the voltage at T is equal to the average between the voltages at nodes G and H, the average between the voltages at nodesD and E is equal to the average of DRE and DRL. This relation is shown in equation 1 1 1 2 x VD VE 1 2 x DRH i DRI. where VD is the voltage at node D and VE is the voltage at node E. These terms can be rearranged to form equation 2 2 VD DM1 DRI. VE Directly above, it was shown that 3 VE DRH DD VRl6 where DD is the diode drop across CR4 or CR6 and VR16 is the voltage drop across resistor R16 or resistor R11.Combining equations 2 and 3 forms equation 4 4 VD DRL DD VRl6When DEL is selected, current flows through diode CR5 and resistor R16, and the voltage at node A VA is given by equation 5 5 VA VD DD VRl6 Substituting equation 4 into equation 5 yields equation 6 6 VA DRI. When DEL is selected, therefore, the voltage at node A is equal to DRL. The voltage at node D thus acts as a clamp voltage for DRL. In summary, the level selector circuit 12 supplies a voltage at node A that equals either DRH or DRL, according to the inputs DHL and DIlL . At small voltage swings, the diode bridge is fully conductive, and the bridge current across resistors RIl and R16 establishes voltages equal to DRE and DRI. at nodes A and B. At large voltage swings, the bridge current equals the constant current, two of the four diodes of the diode bridge conduct at any one time, and the feedback and current sink circuits establish clamp voltages at nodes D and E. This, in turn, establishes voltages equal to DRH and DRL at nodes A and B.At both small and large voltage swings, the current switch controls the direction of the bridge current to select which of DRH and DRI. appears at node A. Turning now to Figures 3 and 4, the circuitry and operation of the buffer and tri state switch 14 will be described. The transistor diode bridge 48 of Figure 3 is a unity gain buffer that generates an output signal at nodeOUT that is equal in voltage to the voltage at node A. Bridge 48 also operates as a high impedance switch to selectively isolate the tri state driver circuit 10 from the device under test. Four transistor Q7, Q8r Q9, and Q10 and four diodesCR9, CR10, CRll, and CR12 form the basic transistor diode bridge. Each of the transistors of the transistor diode bridge is wired in an emitter follower configuration.Transistors Q7 and Q8 are the input transistors of the transistor diode bridge, and have bases that are commonly connected to node A through resistor R23. Transistor Q7 is a PNP transistor having the collector thereof connected to a source of negative voltage, V3, and also coupled to ground through capacitor C13.

Transistors Q9 and Q10 are the output transistors of the transistor diode bridge. Diodes CR11 and CR12 are the output diodes of the transistor diode bridge. The cathode of diode CR11 is commonly connected to the anode of diode CR12, and is connected to node OUT through resistor R34. The anode of diode CR11 and the cathode of diode CR12 are coupled together through a resistor capacitor network that includes capacitor C18, resistor R32, resistor R33, and capacitor C19, all connected in series. The connection between resistors R32 and R33 is coupled to ground through resistorR30 and capacitor C17. The circuitry of the switch controller 50 is illustrated in Figure 4. Transistors Ql9 and Q20 provide a first differential amplifier that operates according to inputs VBB and ON to drive a second differential amplifier composed of transistors Q16 and 017. Transistors Ql9 and Q20 are both PNP transistors with the emitters thereof commonly connected through resistor R60 to a source of positive voltage, V2. The base of transistor Qlg is connected to input VBB through resistor R61 and is coupled to ground through R61 and capacitor C25. The base of transistor Q20 is connected to input ON through resistorR62.The common connection between input ON and resistorR62 is coupled through resistor R63 to a source of negative 4.75 volts and through R63 and capacitor C26 to ground. Transistor Q16 and Q17 are NPN transistors that form the second differential amplifier within the switch controller 50. The base of transistor Q16 is connected to the collector of transistor Ql9 through resistor R54. The end of resistor R54 opposite the base of transistor Q16 is also connected to a source of negative voltage Y3 through resistor R53. When transistor Ql9 is off, a bias voltage is applied to the base of transistor Q16 through resistorsR54 and R53.The collector of transistor Q16 is connected to node OFF through resistor R51. The base of transistor Q17 is connected to the collector of transistor Q20 through resistor R55. The end of resistor R55 opposite the base of transistor Q17 is also connected to V3 through resistorR56. When transistor Q20 is off, a bias voltage is applied to the base of transistor Q17 through resistors R55 andR56. The collector of transistor Q17 is connected to nodeOFF through resistor R52. The emitters of transistors Q16 and Q17 are commonly connected to a source of negative voltage, V4, through resistor R57. Transistor Q18 provides a negative current to nodeI of the transistor diode bridge. Transistor Q18 is anNPN transistor having a collector thereof connected to node . The base of transistor Q18 is connected to the collector of transistor Qlg through resistor R58 and is coupled to ground through capacitor C24. The emitter of transistor Q18 is connected to V4 through resistor R59. Transistors Q13, Q14, and Q15 are constant current sources that are used to respectively drive nodes 1 , OFF, and OFF . Transistor Q13 is a PNP transistor having an emitter connected to Vl through resistor R46 and having a collector connected to node I . Transistor Q14 is a PNP transistor having an emitter connected to Vl through resistor R47 and having a collector connected to the collector of transistor Q16 through resistor R49. The collector of transistor Q14 is connected to node OFF through resistors R49 and R51. Transistor Q15 is a PNP transistor having an emitter connected to V1 through resistor R48 and having a collector connected to node OFF through resistor R50. The bases of transistors Q13, Q14, and Q15 are commonly connected to V2 and are also coupled to ground through capacitor C23. Having thus described the circuitry of the buffer and tri state switch 14, the operation thereof will now be explained. When the tri state driver circuit 10 is to operate as a driver circuit, input ON is higher in voltage than input VBB. When input ON is higher than input VBB, transistor Ql9 is turned on and transistor Q20 is turned off. This in turn turns transistor Q16 on and transistor Q17 off. When transistor Q17 is off, the current from the collector of transistor Q15 flows into node OFF and into node L of the transistor diode bridge.When transistor Q16 is on, current from node M of the transistor diode bridge flows into node OFF and into the collector of 016. The current into node L and out of node M causes diodes CR9 andCR10 to be forward biased and conductive, and turns transistors Q9 and Q10 on. Transistors Q7, Q8, Q9, and Q10 and diodes CR9, CR10, CRll, and CR12 act as a bridge and generate an output signal at node OUT having a voltage that equals the voltage at node A.Current for the output signal is supplied by transistors Q13 and Q18 through nodes 1 and I . The various filter resistors and capacitors act to dampen transients within the buffer and tri state switch circuit. When the tri state driver circuit is to switch to the high impedance output state, input ON is lower in voltage than input VBB. In the preferred embodiment, input VBB is a constant reference voltage and input ON is an ECI. signal that is either logic high or logic low. When inputON is lower than input VBB, transistor Q20 turns on and transistor Ql9 turns off. This in turn turns transistorQ17 on and transistor Q16 off. The current from the collector of transistor Q14 now flows into node OFF and into node M of the transistor diode bridge. Correspondingly, current now flows out of node L to node OFF and into the collector of transistor 017. The current into node H reverse biases diode CR10, while the current out of node L reverse biases diode CR9.Input VCHI and diode CR7 act to clamp the voltage at the base of transistor Q10 to the voltage of VCHI. This causes diode CR12 to be reverse biased for any voltage applied at node OUT that is less than Vain. Similarly, input VCLO and diode CR8 act to clamp the voltage at the base of transistor Q9 to the voltage of VCLO. This causes diode rrll to be reverse biased for any voltage applied at nodeOUT that is greater than VCLO.Thus, any signal applied to node OUT having a voltage between VCLO and Vail is shielded from the tri state driver circuit. preferably, values for VCLO and VCKI are chosen to be just greater than the expected range of signal voltages to improve the response time when the driver circuit is turned back on.
