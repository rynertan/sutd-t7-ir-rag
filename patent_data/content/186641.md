# An arrangement in apparatus for the combustion of waste gases.

## Abstract
A combustion chamber 1 101 , is surrounded by a heater 4 104 , by means of which a constant temperature in the order of 850 C can be maintained in the chamber 1 101 . The chamber 1 101 has arranged therein devices 17, 18, 117 which, when the arrangement is in operation, partly obstruct the passage of gas through the chamber. The waste gases to be treated are introduced into the chamber 1 101 through an inlet 2 102 and the treated, residual waste gas is discharged from the chamber through an outlet 3 103 . The arrangement also includes a supply line 14,15, 16,114,115 for supplying pre heated reaction medium to the interior of the chamber 1 101 .
