## Description
DRYING APPARATUS The present invention relates to an apparatus for drying a powder or granular material, such as resin powder and coal powder, mainly by heat conduction. In the conventional dryer of this type, hot air is supplied to the space over the material to be dried to prevent the decrease in the drying rate caused by the vapor filled in the material layer. Because the amount of the exhaust gas is not so much, the heat taken out by the exhaust gas is not o much, either and therefore the heat efficiency is high. However, it has the following defects. Firstly, because hot gas is not supplied from the bottom of the dryer toward the material layer, the expansion of the material layer does not occur. Therefore, a considerable power is required for mechanical agitating of the material at standstill. Secondly, because the agitating mechanism is of a rigid construction, the weight of the apparatus is substantial.Thirdly, because of a sluggish movement of the material in its layer, the heat transfer to the layer is poor and the moisture content is slow to remove. Because of high water vapor pressure, it takes a long time to dry up the material to a low moisture content. An object of the present invention is to provide a dryer of this type which obviates the above mentioned defects. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. lisa vertical sectional front view of a dryer embodying the present invention Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional side view of the same Fig. 3 is a plan view of the same Fig. 4 is a partially sectional side view of another example of the heater agitator member Fig. 5 is a partially cutaway perspective view of a further example of the heater agitator member Fig. 6 is a vertical sectional front view of an apparatus used for experiment Fig. 7 is a vertical sectional side view of the same and Figs. 8 10 are graphs showing the results of the experiments. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, numeral 1 designates a dryer body. Its bottom is of a semi circular crosssection and has a perforated plate 3 for gas distribution.A dual axis dryer as shown in Fig. 1 has two plates 3 arranged side by side and a single axis dryer has one plate 3. A rotary shaft 4 is provided over each perforated plate 3. A heater agitator member 5 is mounted on each rotary shaft 4 to serve as an agitating member and a hat transfer surface. In the preferred embodiment, the member 5 comprises a pipe spirally wound around the shaft 4 and having its both ends connected to the shaft. Fig. 2 The rotary shaft 4 is hollow and extends rotatably and gastightly through the wall of the dryer body 1.It is supported by means of a bearing 6 and driven by a drive comprising a motor 11 and a transmission chain 12. If a pair of the shafts 4 are provided as shown in Figs. 1 and 3, they may be interlocked by means of gears 7 to rotate them in opposite directions. To the outer end of each rotary shaft 4 are connected an inlet 9 and an outlet 10 for a heat medium through a rotary joint 8. Heat medium such as steam enters the rotary shaft 4 from the inlet 9, leaves it from its inner end into the spiral member 5, and flows into a return pipe in the rotary shaft 4 toward the outlet 10. A support 14 Fig. 1 may be provided to keep the member 5 coaxial with the rotary shaft 4. The support may be in the form of a rod or a pipe. In the latter case, the heat medium may be passed through the support 14. Also, the support may be fan shaped for greater heat transfer surface. Under the dryer body 1 there is provided a gas chamber 15. It may, or may not, be divided into a plurality of chambers 15 having a gas inlet 16 at their bottom. A gas outlet 17 is provided at top of the dryer body 1. At top of its one side there are provided a supply port 19 for supplying the material to be dried and a rotary feeder 18. At bottom of the other side there are provided a rotary discharger 20 and a discharge port 21 for the material. A weir 22 Fig. 2 is provided adjacent to the inner end of the rotary shafts 4. The perforated plates 3 are provided with a rough particle discharge port 23 to which a discharge pipe 25 having a rotary feeder 24 at its bottom is connected. A carrier gas inlet 26 is provided in the end wall of the dryer body under the supply port 19 to blow a carrier gas into the dryer to prevent dew condensation.But, the carrier gas inlet may be omitted. In operation, the powder or granular material to be dried is supplied into the dryer 1 through the port 19 to form a material layer 27. The material is agitated, heated and dried by means of the heater agitator members 5 through which the heat medium flows. The gas blown up through the holes in the perforated plates 3 serves to decrease the agitating load of the material, allowing it to be agitated with a low torque. The material thus dried overflows the weir 22 and is discharged from the port 21 by means of the rotary discharger 20. The coarse particles are discharged through the port 23 and the rotary discharger 24 from the discharge pipe 25. If the heater agitator member 5 is of a spiral shape, it also serves to feed the material toward the discharge port 21 as it rotates. In the dryer according to the present invention, the speed at which the gas is blown into the material layer from under may be lower than the speed at which the material to be dried starts to fluidize. Even if it is lower than that, the gas flow is effective to decrease the agitating load of the material. Since the dryer body has in its bottom two troughs of a semicircular section, its periphery extending along the locus of the spiral blade 5 with an equal distance, the entire material layer is uniformly agitated. Even the material at the bottom does not stay there. The material is easily dispersed and mixed in the layer.As the gas blow in speed increases, the agitating torque decreases sharply. Experiments showed thatin accordance with the present invention the agitating torque will be about one third to one fifth of that in the conventional dryer of this type in which no gas is blown from under. Figs. 6 and 7 show an apparatus used for experiments in which the dryer body 1 has a width of 260 mm and a depth of 330 mm and two heater agitator members 5 having different diameters one is 240 mm dia. and the other is 180 mm dia. are mounted on the rotary shaft 4. Gas is supplied from a blower 31 through a piping 32 to a gas inlet 16 of the dryer 1. A valve 33, a flowmeter 34, and an exhaust pipe 36 with a valve 35 are provided. In Fig. 7, the rotary shaft 4 is driven by a drive 37. A torque detector 38 and a pressure gauge 39 are provided. The above mentioned apparatus for experiment was used to measure the torque, using millet and maltose as the sample. The former is dry and free flowing and the latter is irregular and cohesive. The table 1 shows the properties of samples. Table 1EMI6.1 tb Sample SEP Particle SEP bulk SEP density SEP minimum SEP fluidization tb SEP size SEP 3 SEP Velocity SEP Umf tb SEP In SEP m SEP in SEP kg m SEP SEP in SEP m second tb Millet SEP 1500 1700 SEP 800 SEP 0.43 tb Maltose 1 SEP 840 1700 SEP 490 SEP 0.37 tb Maltose 2 SEP 300 840 SEP 490 SEP j SEP 0.11 tb Figs. 8 10 show the result of experiments in which the torque was measured with the samples shown in Table 1 by use of the apparatus of Figs. 6 and 7. Fig. 8 is the graph for millet in which the torque ratio of the torque when gas in blown to the torque when no gas is supplied from under is plotted along the ordinate axis and the ratio of the gas velocity to the minimum fluidization velocity is plotted along the abscissa axis. Fig. 8 shows that the agitating torque decreases substantially linearly as the gas flow rate increases, and that when the flow rate comes near the minimum fluidization velocity, the torque will be one third to one fourth of that when no gas is supplied from under. Figs. 9 and 10 are for maltoses which have a poor flowability. These graphs show that as the gas flow rate increases, the agitating torque decreases sharply and at the minimum fluidization velocity the torque will be about one tenth of that when no gas is supplied.This shows that the supply of gas from under is markedly effective for poorly free flowing materials. Thus, the powder or granular material is dispersed and mixed even at a gas velocity below the minimum fluidization velocity by a mechanical agitating effect. Therefore, even if the gap between the heater agitator member 5 and the perforated plate 3 is large, the powder or granular material will not settle. This does not require the manufacturing accuracy and reduces the weight of the dryer. The contact between the material and the heater agitator member is continually renewed by the gas through flow and agitating effect. This results in rapid transfer of heat and moisture vapor. Also, the vapor pressure in the material layer is low, the temperature rise of the material is small, and partial heating of the material does not occur. Therefore, the dryer according to the present invention can be used with higher temperature source than in the conventional dryer of this type.In other words, the temperature difference between the material and the heater agitator members 5 can be kept higher. Therefore, the drying rate is higher and the material can be dried to a lower moisture content. The material can be dried fully with lower power requirement for driving the rotary member 5. This makes it possible to make a full use of the heat transfer area of the members 5 by filling the material in the chamber with higher hold up. In short, in accordance with the present invention in which gas is supplied from under, the material can be dried more efficiently and more rapidly to a lower moisture content than in the conventional dryer of this type. Also, the maintenance and operating costs can be reduced because the power requirement to agitate the material is less. In accordance with the present invention, the velocity of gas supplied from under may be smaller than the minimum fluidization velocity. If owing to too small an amount of the gas supplied the exhaust gas might condense with the moisture vapor, carrier gas may be blown into the dryer through a port 26 Fig. 4 . In the preferred embodiment the gas chamber 15 is divided by the plates 13 into a plurality of sections for which different gas velocities can be used, because the property of the material differs with the degree of cohesion dependent on the moisture content. Although in the preferred embodiment a pair of rotary shafts 4 are arranged side by side, the shaft may be single or they may be arranged one above the other. The rotary shafts 4 may be adapted to turn in one direction or the other. Although in the embodiment the surface on the heater agitator member 5 is used as a heating surface, a heating jacket 2 as illustrated in Fig. 1 by a dotted line may be provided on the wall of the body 1, or stationary heating pipes or plates 28 as shown in Fig. 4 may be fixed in the body 1 to heat the material with a heat medium passed therethrough. In Fig. 4, the rotary shaft 4 extending through the heating plates 28 is provided with agitating blades 29 which may be spiral or of any other shape. Referring to Fig. 5, another example of heater agitator member is shown which has a plurality of disc plates 30 fixed on the rotary shaft 4, said disc plates being hollow to hold a heat medium. As the gas supplied into the dryer, air at ambient temperature or hot air may be used. If the latter is used, the heat transfer area for indirect heating can be reduced because heat fransfers also by convection.
