# Improvements in or relating to drive mechanisms for rotating crankshafts for use in machine tools.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a drive mechanism for rotating a crankshaft in the machine tool for working on the crankshaft. The mechanism includes a disc 17 rotatable about a horizontal axis 12 coincident with the crankshaft axis, the disc having a radial slot 18 to receive a throw of the crankshaft. An endless flexible drive belt 16 extends around a greater part of the periphery of the disc except for an upper part of the disc periphery and a round a drive device 13 to rotate the disc and with it the crankshaft throw in the radial slot in the disc. The crankshaft can be inserted in and removed from the disc when the disc is orientated with the slot vertical and when rotated away from the vertical, the crankshaft throw is retained in the slot by reason of the endless belt extending over the slot.
