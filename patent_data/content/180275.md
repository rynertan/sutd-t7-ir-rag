# Circuit comprising series connected semiconductor elements.

## Abstract
Controlled avalanche semiconductor elements, which are connected in series and are irradiated with a controllable quantity of light form circuits which in principle can switch an unlimited high voltage or can control such a voltage. Dissipating auxiliary means to obtain a uniform voltage distribution over the circuit are not required. As a light source, light emitting diodes can be used so that the elements can be controlled at a low voltage level and with DC separation. The circuit can be used in high voltage amplifiers, high voltage regulators or high voltage stabilizers, deflection voltage generators, high voltage switches in X ray apparatus, lasers, ignition systems in combustion engines.
