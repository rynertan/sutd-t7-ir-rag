# Process for the production of 2,2,6,6 tetraalkyl 4 piperidylamines.

## Abstract
2,2,6,6 tetraalkyl 4 piperidylamines are produced by reacting an amine with a 2,2,6,6 tetraalkyl 4 piperidone in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of platinum, nickel and cobalt, employing a reaction medium comprising a between about 10 and 100 weight percent water and b between 0 and about 90 weight percent of a polar organic compound selected from the group consisting of C₁ C₁₀ aliphatic alcohols and C₂ C₆ aliphatic glycols.
