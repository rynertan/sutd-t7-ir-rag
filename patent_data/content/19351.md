# Filtration of a coal liquid slurry using an alkylmethacrylate copolymer.

## Abstract
The rate of filtration of a coal liquid slurry is increased by adding an alkylmethacrylate copolymer to the slurry prior to filtration or by washing a precoat cake of filter aid with an oil solution of the alkylmethacrylate copolymer prior to filtration.
