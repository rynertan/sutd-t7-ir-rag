# ELEMENT FOR ELECTROPHORESIS

## Abstract
An element for electrophoresis suitably employable for analysis of biopolymers such as proteins, as well as for determination of base sequence of DNA, RNA, their frag ments, and their derivatives, which comprises a plastic material support, an adhesive layer containing an inorganic oxide and a binder, an medium layer for electrophoresis comprising an aqueous polyacrylamide gel formed by crosslinking polymerization of an acrylamide compound and a crosslinking agent in the presence of water, and a plastic material covering film. The electrophoresis medium layer may contain a water soluble polymer and agarose. The medium layer may contain a modifier such as an anionic surfactant, formamide or urea.
