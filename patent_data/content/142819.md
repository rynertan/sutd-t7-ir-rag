## Abstract
An access control system for controlling the access to a storage which is divided into a hardware area inaccessible to ordinary programs and a software area for storing the ordi nary programs, includes address registration means 20, 22 and access control means 23 . The address registration means has a plurality of entries, each of which holds a previously used address of the storage and a flag for indicat ing whether the previously used address is included in the hardware area or not. Further, the address registration means indicates whether an address at which the storage is to be accessed, is present in the address registration means or not. The access control means controls the access to the storage in accordance with the flag from the address registration means, a signal indicative of whether the to be accessed address of the storage is present in the address registration means or not, and the access mode which is now used.
