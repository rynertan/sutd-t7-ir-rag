# Solvent system for peroxidase inhibitor reagent for fecal occult blood determinations.

## Abstract
A process and reagent for determining the presence of fecal occult blood in a test sample using a guaiac peroxidase test matrix and a means for inhibiting peroxidase enzyme interferences which combines the partial denaturing of peroxidase enzyme protein using a protein hydrogen bond cleaving agent, with the removal of metals necessary for efficient peroxidase enzyme activity wherein the improve ment comprises dissolving said reagent for cleaving protein hydrogen bonds in an alcohol water solvent before adding said reagent to the sample.
