# Method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
An oxide layer 15 is partially formed on an n type region 13a surrounded by a field oxide region 14 . A base region 16 of a switching transistor is formed in the n type region 13a with a mask of the oxide layer. Arsenic doped polysili con layers 17₁, 17₂, 17₃ are selectively formed on the surfaces of the oxide layer 15 and the base region 16 , simultane ously. With a mask of those polysilicon layers 17₁, 17₂, 17₃ , the emitter and collector regions 20₁, 20₂, of an injector transistor and an external base region 20₂, 20₃, 20₄ of a switching transistor are formed in the n type region and the base region. Arsenic doped into the polysilicon layers 17₁, 17₂, 17₃ is diffused into the base region 16 , so that the collector regions 19₁, 19₂ of the switching transistor are formed self aligned.
