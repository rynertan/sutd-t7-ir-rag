# IMPROVED BATTERY JUMP CABLE APPARATUS

## Abstract
Apparatus for transferring power from the battery 256 of a service vehicle to the battery 258 of a second vehicle, wherein the final connection between the batteries is made from a remote location via a radio transmitter 80 and a receiver 270 which is mounted in the casing 22 of the apparatus to actuate a solenoid 72 in response to a signal from the transmitter 80 . The circuit between the solenoid 72 and the receiver 270 includes a transistor 280 to control current through the solenoid coil 268 and the base of the transistor 280 is connected to the battery 258 of the second vehicle. Cables 28, 30 used to attach the apparatus to the second vehicle battery 258 are wound on a spool 26 having an interrupted ratchet 88 on one end thereof, the ratchet 88 engaging a ratchet lock 90 that pivots in one direction to hold the reel 24 when the reel 24 is turned in one direction to pay out the battery cables 28, 30 and the ratchet lock 90 pivoting in the other direction within a ratchet wheel interrupt tion to permit free rotation of the reel 24 in the opposite direction for retrieval of the cables 28, 30 on the reel 24 .
