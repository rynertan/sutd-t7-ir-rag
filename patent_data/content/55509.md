# A continuous form assembly of mailer sets.

## Abstract
A continuous form mailer set assembly is provided in which the interior plies 36 of each mailer set are extended into both line hole stubs 54 . The interior plies associated with each mailer set are completely separate one from another and there is no continuous stub on either side of the interior plies. Thus, only the two outside plies are glued together where the form is folded and this eliminates the tenting problem. Both sides of all of the interior plies have slots 34 punched through them and the glue lines are put down so that when the form is assembled the glue bleeds through the corresponding holes of the interior plies to maintain their registration.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A continuous form mailer set assembly comprising a front and a back continuous sheet, successive, individually separate packets of interior plies positioned longitudinally along and between said front and back continuous sheets, each packet including one or more sheets, and each of said packets being attached between said front and back continuous sheets along both of its longitudinal edges, whereby the said front and back continuous sheets may be tranversely folded between said successive separate packets such that only said front and back sheets are included in the fold. 2. The continuous form mailer set assembly as set forth in claim 1 above wherein the attachment of the successive interior ply packets along both of its longitudinal edges is accomplished by a single glue line positioned along each of the longitudinal edges of the assembly, and each of said interior ply packets has a series of punched slots also along each of its longitudinal edges, whereby the longitudinal glue lines pass directly adjacent said series of punch slots such that the glue from each of said glue lines bleeds through the punch holes to the opposite continuous sheet to thereby join together said assembly with a pair of glue lines. 3.

## Description
TITLE A CONTINUOUS FORTY ASSEMBLY OF IWILER SETSBackground of the InventionA. Field of the Invention This invention relates to continuous business forms and more particularly to multiple ply continuous mailer set assemblies.B. Prior Art Many prior art assemblies in this field experienced problems of. tenting . This phenomena is so named because when the zig zag stack, into which the forms are initially folded, is unfolded, a tent like peak appears at each fold line. This tent like peak is caused by the longitudinal movement of the various plies, one to another, as the forms are originally folded.The relative movement, in turn, is caused by slippage between the forms at the fold before the glue dries. A further problem was caused by the use of excessive glue. This came about as the result of the use of a glue line between each of the multiple plies. This excessive use of glue aused stiffness in the stub portion of the assembly and thereDy made the forms difficult to feed through automatic printing equipment. U. S Patents 23,104,799 and 3,339,827, both issued to Donald J. Steidinger and assigned to Uarco, Incorporated and U. S. Patent t3,554,438 issued to Edmund G. Van flalderghem and assigned to Moore Business Forms, Inc. illustrate examples of the continuous business form art. In all of these patents, the interior plies are contained by gluing between each of the plies. The gluing may be done in either the left or right hand stubs. The plies are held in proper registration by leaving a stub continuous in either the left or the right hand stub. As mentioned earlier, it is this multiplicity of glue layers as well as this continuous stub which causes both the stiffness in the stub and the tenting problems.Brief Description of the InventionA. Objects of the Invention Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a unigue and simple continuous form, mailer set assembly which solves not only the stub stiffness problem but the tenting problem as well. This solution is achieved while still maintaining the registration of the internal plies. It is another object of this invention to provide a continuous mailer set form whose multiple interior plies are contained on both longitudinal sides of the assembly. It is still another object of this invention to provide a continuous mailer set form whose interior plies are contained by the use of a single bead of glue on either side of the assembly. It is another object of this invention to provide a continuous mailer set form whose interior plies each have a series of corresponding holes along either of their longitudinal sides. It is still a further object of this invention to provide a continuous business mailer set form whose multiple interior plies are glued together via a single glue bead longitudinally passing adjacent to and bleeding through a series of punched holes in all of said interior plies.B. Summary of the Invention In the preferred. embodiment of this invention, a continuous mailer set form assembly is provided which comprises a plurality of interior plies within each mailer set. The multiplicity of interior plies in each mailer set are attached between a front and a back longitudinally continuous sheet at both their left and their right hand edges. A series of holes are punched entirely through the plurality of interior plies along their right and left edges parallel to the longitudinal path of the continuous form. A left and right hand glue line runs adjacent to the series of punched holes such that the glue bleeds through the holes of the interior plies to permanently attach the interior plies. As the continuous form is folded in a.zig zag manner, the only material included at the successive folds are the front and back sheet.Further, the interior plies are all glued via a longitudinal pair of single glue lines rather than the successive layers of interior plies and glue lines. The resulting configuration provides a unique continuous mailer set assembly having improved tenting characteristics and increased flexibility through a reduction in glue lines. This improvement is accomplished while maintaining interior ply registration.Brief Description of the Drawings The foregoing objects and the summary will be more readily understood when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates a prior art continuous form showing the continuous stub characteristics, the single side registration and the multiple glue lines, Figure 2 illustrates the present invention showing the double side registration, the lack of a continuous stub and the reduction in glue lines. Detailed Description of the Invention The following detailed description will be more easily comprehended when it is read with reference to the foregoing drawings in which like reference characters symbolize corresponding parts. Figure 1 illustrates the prior art continuous form 10 which includes the top sheet 12 and the bottom sheet 14.Sandwiched between these two sheets 12 and 14 is a plurality of interior plies 16. Between each of the interior plies is a glue line 18. As is shown, there is a plurality of glue lines 18 equal to one less than the plurality of interior plies 16.Further, there are continuous stubs 20 connecting successive groups of these interior plies 16. It is believed readily apparent that significant problems will exist when this continuous form 10 is zig zag folded at the fold lines. Thus, as the number of interior plies 16 is increased, the thickness of the continuous stub 20 increases. This increase in thickness prevents a smooth folding of the form 10 at the fold lines. Since the glue used is usually not dry at the time of folding, there is a relative shift of the interior plies one to another and this results in the tenting problem previously discussed. This problem is well known in the art to which this invention relates. Further, as the number of interior plies increases the number of glue lines 18 which exist between the individual interior plies also increases. This increase in the plurality of glue lines stiffens the edge of the form and this results in decreased flexibility. Consequently, the form does not adapt to automatic printing equipment as easily as it might. In summary, in prior art the interior plies are contained by gluing between each ply in either the left or right stub. The plies are held in register by leaving a stub continuous on either the left or right side. This type of construction has several problems. The glue line is put down between each ply in the continuous stub, which is a major contributor to tenting slippage between the forms at the fold before the glue dries .Gluing between each ply also leaves an excessive amount of glue in that stub causing stiffness in the stub which makes the forms difficult to feed through automatic printing equipment. The construction shown in Figure 2 eliminates problems while still maintaining the registration of the internal plies.Figure 2 shows an exploded view of a typical mailer set 40 showing the interior plies 36 extending into both line hold stubs 54.It should be noted that there is no continuous stub on either side of the interior plies they are completely separated from each other. This means that there are only two plies glued together where the form is folded at the folding lines, which eliminates the tenting problem. Slots 34 are punched through all the interior plies 36 on both ends thereof, a short distance toward the center of the form from each line hole stub perforations 48. Two glue lines 38 are applied to both the back of the face ply 42 and on the face of the back ply 44. The glue lines 38 are put down so that when the form 40 is assembled, these glue,lines fall underneath and above the punched slots 34 in the interior plies 36. This allows the glue to bleed through the slots 34, sealing both of the ends of the outer plies 42, 44 of the mailer 40 together. Because there are only two glue lines on each mailer, no matter how many interior plies there are, the resulting stubs 56, 58 are much more flexible and easier to feed through automatic printing equipment. The mailer set is opened by removing the tear off stub 56 at the tear off perforation 50. This perforation 50 is on all plies, face, back and all interior plies. The interior plies are then grasped at the thumb point 60 and snapped out breaking loose at the snap perforation 52. It will be understood from the foregoing description that various modifications and changes may be made in the preferred embodiment of the present invention without departing from its true spirit. It is intended that this description is for purposes of illustration only and snould not be construed in a limiting sense. The scope of this invention should be limited only by the language of the following claims.
