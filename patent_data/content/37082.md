In the following table, the resulting compounds are taken from starting materials which are made available by the foregoing text and examples particularlyTable II of Example 19. The column labelled Remarks and Reagents annotates the established procedure where necessary to botain the indicated compound.In most instances the compounds are deblocked according to the procedure described in Example 16 However, when the SR8 side chain does not contain a basic function, the final product I is more conveniently isolated as the sodium salt M Na which result is facilitated by conducting the deblocking in a slight excess of NaHCO3. In any event, when either R6 or R7 bears a basic group, the final product I is most conveniently isolated as the free acid M H , rather than the sodium salt. It should be noted that compounds designated as free acids in reality are isolated as inner salts as a consequence of their zwitterionic nature.
