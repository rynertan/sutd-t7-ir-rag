# A refractometer.

## Abstract
A refractor for determining the concentration of dissolved solids in a sample solution has an enclosing opaque housing 11 , a light source 26 directing a substantially collimated monochromatic light beam through a hollow transparent walled prismatic container 13 for holding a liquid solution to be tested. A light sensor 40 is disposed in the refracted path of the light beam and responds to the extact refraction of the beam caused by passing through the liquid soiution. A display is actuated by the light sensor and digitally displays the exact refraction as a function of the concentration of dissolved solids in the liquid sample.
