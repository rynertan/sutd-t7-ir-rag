# INDEPENDENTLY OPERABLE LOCAL AREA NETWORK

## Abstract
A data processing system 20 incorporates host proces sors 22 and 24 connected by network interface units 28 and 34 to a coaxial cable 26 . The network interface units 28 and 34 , cable 26 , and network interface units 40 56 form a local area network capable of carrying out processing operations on information independent of the host processors 22 and 24 . As a result, interrupts of the host processors 22 and 24 for data transfer oparations are significantly reduced, allow ing the system 20 to support a much larger number of user terminals and other peripherals.
