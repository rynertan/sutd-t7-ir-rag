# Reciprocating exhauster.

## Abstract
A reciprocating, preferably a piston type, exhauster adapted for mounting on an engine crankcase and having, on opposite sides of the piston, a high clearance volume inlet chamber and a low clearance volume exhaust chamber. The piston is operated by an engine driven cam acting on the piston rod which passes through the exhaust chamber and moves against a return spring in the inlet chamber. As the piston moves in the cylinder air is drawn from the inlet chamber through a non return valve in the piston to the exhaust chamber and then is discharged directly into the engine crankcase.

## Description
RECIPROCATING EXHAUSTER This invention relates to a reciprocating exhauster of the kind used to provide vacuum to operate a vehicle braking servo predominantly on vehicles driven be diesel engines. Such exhausters are known which are operated by an engine driven cam acting on the piston or push rod.Normally, an inlet valve, which may a reed type or disctype valve, is fitted in the connection between the vacuum reservoir and the cylinder and an exhaust valve in communication with the clearance volume i.e. cylinder volume at top dead centre is. fitted in the cylinder casing. The performance of such exhausters depends to a considerable extent upon the size of the clearance volume which is critically affected by component tolerances. British Patent specification No. 2,003,990A discloses a vacuum pump or exhauster which is driven by the engine cam shaft and includes a reciprocable pump member operable to withdraw air from an inlet and expel it to atmosphere.The pump member which may be a diaphragm or a piston divides the cylinder body into an inlet chamber and an outlet chamber, the body and the pump member being so shaped as to minimise the clearance volume of the inlet chamber which is the primary pumping chamber. Air passes through a check valve in a flow path through the pump member, to the exhaust chamber which has a relatively large minimum volume intended to increase the pump efficiency while at the same time reducing the noise attributable to gas discharge from the primary pumping chamber. According to the present invention, we propose a reciprocating exhauster for mounting on an engine casing to be driven by the engine and comprising a pump member working in a cylinder body so as to define on opposite sides thereof an inlet chamber having an inlet for onnection to a vacuum reservoir, and an exhaust chamber having an outlet fitted with an exhaust valve, and a valve arranged to permit fluid to flow from the inlet chamber to the exhaust chamber, wherein the pump member and the cylinder body are shaped to minimise the clearance volume of the exhaust chamber. As in conventional reciprocating exhausters, the pump member, usually a piston, may be driven by a cam acting directly on the piston rod which, preferably, passes through the exhaust chamber. Further, the piston is conveniently biased into contact with the cam by a return spring disposed in the inlet chamber. Preferably, the inlet to the inlet chamber is fitted with a non return valve which serves to increase the efficiency of the exhauster. If, however, no non return valve is fitted the inlet chamber effectivelyprovidesadditional vacuum reservoir capacity. Further, the invention enables a simpler and cheaper construction due, in part, to the relative ease with which component tolerances can be controlled, than is possible with conventional piston exhausters and in which different strbkes can be accomodated with minimal component changes. The present invention, therefore, differs from the exhauster disclosed in British Patent specification 2,003,990 in that the flow through the two chambers of different clearance volumes is in the opposite direction, That is the air first enters the chamber with high clearance volume and not as in BP 2,003,990, the low clearance volume chamber. The exhaust chamber is the main pumping chamber. In the preferred embodiment the exhaust port is positioned on the piston or push rod side of the exhaust chamber, this having an advantage in that the exhaust air can be discharged directly into the engine crankcase on which the exhuaster is mounted, so avoiding the problem of noise generated by the exhaust valve, and the inlet is conveniently located away from the mounting flange. Also, this arrangement enables the exhauster according to the present invention tp be more compact than conventional exhausters and facilitates the admission to the pumping chamber of oil from the crankcase for sealing and lubrication. The oil is then returned to the crankcase with the exhaust air.In a piston exhauster arranged as described in British Patent No. 2,003,990 oil entering the pump chamber would be discharged into the atmosphere unless an additional pipe is connected between the exhaust port and the crankcase. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a cross sec ion of a piston exhauster, Figure 2 is a cross section of the piston of the exhauster shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross section of the exhaust valve of the exhauster shown in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a cross section of a piston exhauster similar to that shown in Figure 1 but having a non return valve fitted in the inlet port and Figure 5 is a cross section of another piston exhauster similar, in principle, to the exhauster shown in Figure 4. With reference to Figures 1 to 3 the piston exhauster is bolted onto the engine crankcase Q through which passes a piston push rod, A within a bearing E and in engagement with an engine driven cam . The piston rod is sealed by a low friction ring seal L. Within the cylinder body G of the exhauster , which iscuplike pressing, is a piston C bolted to the piston rod A and carrying a low friction piston ring seal J held by a floating retainer I upon which a return spring H acts directly so clamping the seal J. Above the piston C is a high clearance volume inlet chamber in direct communicaton with a vacuum reservoir not shown via a pipe S and the space created between the piston C and the base block F as the piston works within the cylinder G moving away from the position equivalent to top dead centre illustrated, is a low clearance volume exhaust chamber communicating with the interior of the crankcase Q via an exhaust valve K which may be a disc type check or non return valve, such as shown in Figure 3, let into a recess in the base block F. The pressing G is secured to the block F by crimping, accurate machining of the pressing G therefore being unnecessary since, provided the block F is accurately machined, the block F serves to size the cylinder bore during assembly to provide a good piston seal. Static O ring seals M and N are fitted between the pressing G and the external diameter of the block F, and between the block F and the engine crankcase Q, respectively. As shown more clearly in Figure 2, a disc or flap valve B is clamped between the piston C and piston rod A so as to cover four equally angularly spaced holes passing through the piston. In the position top dead centre shown in Figure 1, the valve B is received within a recess in the bock F so minimising the clearance volume of the exhaust chamber. In operation, as the cam turns, the piston rod A and piston and seal assembly B, G, D, I and J are displaced upwardly against the action of the return spring H, thus creating a partial vacuum on the lower side of the piston i.e. in the exhaust chamber . The disc or flaptvalve B opens to admit air from the inlet chamber in communication with the vacuum reservoir , to the exhaust chamber. As the cam continues to rotate, the piston is driven downwardly by the return spring H to exhaust air in the exhaust chamber through the check valve K directly into the engine crankcase. The performance of eausters in general, and the above described exhauster in particular, is affected by the size of the clearance volume in the main pumping chamber, in this case the exhaust chamber, and this is critically affected by component tolerances particularly where the piston stroke is small. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 to 3, the tolerances on the thickness of block F and the length of the piston rod A control the closest approach of the piston C to the block F and hence the clearance volume. Both of the components A and F are designed so that the relevant dimensions can be cheaply controlled in production. With the crankcase mounting shown in Figure 1 i.e.using bolts P into the engine flange the block F may be allowed to protrude slightly from the cylinder body pressingG so that when mounting the exhauster the bolts P draw the cylinder body pressing to the crankcase flange ensuring that the block F is in contact with the flange. In the piston exhauster shown in Figure 4, a disc type or non return valve R is fitted in the pipe S connected to the vacuum reservoir, We believe, that this arrangement yields an increase in efficiency but equally important, it serves to prevent oil passing in to the vacuum reservoir. Figure 5 shows another embodiment of piston exhauster which is similar in principle to the exhauster of Figure 4, but in which the bearing E is replaced by a bore in the block F, and the seal L is omitted. Also, the piston is of a one piece construction and the flap valve B which covers two annular grooves in the face of the piston has a supporting washer.
