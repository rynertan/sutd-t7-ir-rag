## Description
A process for preparing an implant material which releases medicines in the body. This invention relates to a system which after implantation releases a medicine to its surroundings, and which during the process of release is dissolved in full. It can be inferred from an article by Wahling et al. The release of gentamycin from polymethylmethacrylate beads, J. Bone Joint Surg.Br. Vol., 1978, 60, 270 that a two component system consisting of beads of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement in which the antibiotic gentamycin is dissolved is capable of successfully treating osteomyelitis. One disadvantage is that after the release of the antibiotic the beads of bone cement must be surgically removed from the bone. In the literature, therefore, certain methods are indicated of using, instead of the nonresorbing bone cement, a material that is dissolved in the body itself, so that surgical removal is unnecessary. A first method is the use of beta whitlockite instead of bone cement. Beta whitlockite chemical formula Ca3 PO4 2 is, under certain conditions, more or less soluble. The biological dissolving process depends on the way in which the subject product has been sintered. Sintering is a process see a Chapter by K. de Groot in the book Biocompatability of Clinical Implant Materials , Editor D.F. Williams,C.R.C. Press, Boca Raton, USA, 1981, 199 224 the principle of which is that, by heating, powder particles are cemented together via solid state diffusion, so that from a powder, a solid body is formed . The rate of dissolution is promoted by ensuring that the poweder particles are only connected together by means of small necks . Eittenmuller et al. see his paper entitled Resorbierbare Antibiotik Antiseptische TCP keramik zur lokalen Behandlung der Osteomyelitis, L.Koelner Workshop dber Hydzoxylkeramik, Cologne, December 7, 1983 have used this betawhitlockite also referred to as beta TCP or ss TCP in a highly porous form as a carrier for an antibiotic, instead of bone cement. A second method is the use of calcium sulphate Plaster of Paris .Varlet et al., in the article Billes de platre de Paris aux antibiotique dans le traitement de 1 infection osseuse , in Revue de ChirurgieOrthopedique , 1983, 69, 239 244, have indicated and shown that gypsum, too, can function as a biologically soluble bead. Their method is predicated on gypsy being made up with the medicine to form a solid final product by adding water , which like Bittenmuller S TCP has a highly porous coosition. Other methods are not based on ceramic starting materials, and accordingly fall outside the scope of the present patent application. Chacteristic of both methods is that the medicine antibiotic is released by diffusion, whereafter the remaining implant the remaining component is resorbed, so that the surgical removal of the beads is unnecessary. It follows that the release of the medicine is not deter mined by the rate of biodegradation of the implant system . Both methods, however, have certain disadvantages. Beta TCP has the disadvantage that the dissolving process may have adverse sideeffects. The cause is as follows. After being implanted, a porous betaTCP product, on account of the loose bond between the sintered particles eak necks disintegrates into loose particles, which in turn are carried off by macrophages to neighbouring lymph glands. Depending on the weakness of the bond between the sintered particles, the dissolving process which is thus effected is taking place at a faster or slower rate. Non porous beta whitlockite is hardly resorbed .In certain cases the particles carried off are not intracellularly dissolved before the lymph glands are reached, so that, in that case, the lymph glands are filled with calcium phosphate particles. If no macrophages are present, or not enough, particles are accumulated around the implant, whereby further release is adversely affected. A second disadvantage of beta TCP is that the dissolving process is biologically determined owing to the essential role of macrophages, so that there is no certainty as to the eventual disappearance of the implant. Calcium sulphate, too, has a disadvantage its rate of dissolution is so high that the implant is not always replaced by bone tissue, which may leave a void Frame, J. Dent., 3, 177, 1975 . One advantage, compared with beta whitlockite, is that the dissolving process is a truly physicochemical, and hence predictable one. The present invention provides a system which 1 unlike the betawhitlockite described earlier, is dissolved not via disintegration into small particles, and hence without involving macrophagic removal and 2 is not dissolved as fast as gypsum, so that bone voids may be left. The invention is characterized by being a system comprising a matrix of a mixture of CaSO4 and CaHP04, in variable proportions, produced by heating powders of CaSO4 and Cast04 together to the melting point of CaBPO4, i.e., about 700 C, for some minutes. As this mixture has a solubility which, on the one hand, is intermediate that of CaS04 and that of CaHP04 see the above article by K. de Groot and, on the other hand, is many times higher that that of beta whitlockite, it is thus achieved that the dissolving process 1 can be varied in rate, and 2 is not brought about via particles tb be carried off by macrophages. To the matrix, heated to form a microporous mass, the desired medicine can be added by means of impregnation.
