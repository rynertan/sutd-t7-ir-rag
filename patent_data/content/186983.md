# Electrostatic spraying.

## Abstract
An electrostatic spraying apparatus in which an electrode 7 is mounted adjacent to the sprayhead, means are provided for causing a first electrical potential to be applied to liquid emerging from the sprayhead, and further means are provided for applying a second electrical potential to the electrode 7 . The difference between the first and second potentials is suffi cient to cause an intense field to be developed between the emerging liquid and the electrode, sufficient to stomise the liq uid. The electrode has a core 9 of conducting or semiconduct ing material sheated in a semi insulating material 11 . This semi insulating material has a dielectric strength and volume resistivity sufficiently high to prevent sparking between the electrode and the sprayhead and a volume resistivity sufficient ly low to allow charge collected on the surface of the material to be conducted through the semi insulating material 11 to the conducting or semiconducting core 9 .
