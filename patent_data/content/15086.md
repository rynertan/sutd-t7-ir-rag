# Kelly bushing in a downhole drilling system.

## Abstract
A kelly bushing 16 for a downhole drilling system is constructed to allow an electric cable connected to a dow nhole motor or a sensing mechanism located in the area of the downhole motor for feeding back to the surface appropriate electrical signals indicative of certain drilling operations, to be fed into the hole being drilled alongside the drill string without interfering with engagement between the kelly bushing and the kelly 10 . The kelly bushing includes a pair of rollers 22. 24 mounted in the bearings 30, 32 and adapted to engage the kelly to allow the kelly 10 and the attached drill string 4, 6 to move in a forward direction into the hole being drilled while preventing any rotational or lateral movement. A base plate 36 of the kelly bushing has an opening through which the kelly passes and through which an electric cable can be guided into the hole, and a gate 56 is hinged to the base plate to permit entry of the cable into the opening of the base plate 36 .
