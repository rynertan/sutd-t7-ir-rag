# Apparatus and method for segregating counted slugs of flat folded boxes.

## Abstract
An apparatus 47 for handling a plurality of flat, col lapsed, folded paper boxes 23 which have been produced on a high speed, folder gluer 37, 38, 39 , delivered in shingled formation 41 onto the advancing apron 21 of a stacker 22 , counted into slugs 42, 43, 44 of about fifty each and must be packed into cases for shipment. To enable an op erator to grasp individual and successive lifts of the flats 23 between her hand and remove them for packing, the appa ratus includes a secondary apron 26 traveling at less speed than the stacker apron 21 to raise the shingled flats 23 upstanding on lower edge 27 , hold down belts 33 to pre vent misalignment and a transversely movable segregation rod 77 mounted on a carriage 62 movable horizontally alongside the path 24 of the flats 23 . The carriage 62 has one way clutch rollers 81, 85 so that the rod 77 will hold back the leading flat 45 but the carriage 62 will roll freely back to the next slug 43 . Speed reduction mechanism 99 may be used to advance the carriage 62 at less speed than the apron 26 to compress the line 41 of flats 23 when edge stacking is desirable or necessary.

## Description
APPARATUS AND MEEROD FOR SEGREGATING COUNTED SLUGS OF FLAT SOIDED BOXES.In the folding paper box machine art, folder gluers are well known to produce flat folded boxes, called flatsR herein, at high speed from flat blanks, by folding and gluing the flaps, tabs and panels thereof and delivering the adhered, collapsed flats to the upper stretch of the endless apron of a stacker. At the exit end of the stacker, it has been the custom for several employees to seek to keep up with the production of the folder gluer by repeatedly manually removing successive individual packets or lifts and carrying them over to empty packing cases for depositing one layer, or several layers, to the case.When the flats are shingled and recumbent, with, for example, each fiftieth flat counted and projecting slightly from the line of flats, it will be understood that the operator must place the hand under the flat at the point she believes she can easily carry, raise the flats to upstand on lower edge, compress the lift and try to bodily transport it to an empty case without dropping it on the floor. This continual manual lifting is not only arduous, but if a lift is dropped the stacker continues delivering flats until the entire line may have to be stopped.In U.S. Patent 3,811,549 to Pressig of May 21, 1974, an apparatus for handling collapsed boxes is disclosed in which a sled and skates with a brake are located in front of the leading box to advance therewith up to a fixed barrier, and the segregation element is a plate poised above the path to descend downwardly across the entire path of the nSlats. With the fixed stop of this device covering the entire leading flat and the segregation element covering the entire trailing flat, it would be difficult for an operator to grasp the packet, lift or slug between her hands and slide it further along the path. An unillustrated ram is apparently intended to move the captive packet sidewise of the path.This invention is directed to an apparatus and method for handling flats, which will enable a single operator to move from a case packer to the stacker, grasp a slug of counted flats between her hands, slide the slug in the direction of advance of the flats onto a transfer table and into an empty case, and return to grasp the next successive counted slug and repeat the cycle as described in U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 583,640 filedFebruary 27, 1984.The invention provides apparatus for segregating a counted slug of flat folded boxes from a plurality of such flats being advanced in a path on the apron of a stacker, characterised by guide means associated with said stacker and including a guide extending substantially horizontally substantially in parallelism with said path a carriage mounted to move substantially horizontally along said guide substantially in parallelism with said path roller means, including at least bne roller on said carriage in rolling contact with the apron of said stacker one way clutch means, forming part of said roller means for said carriage to advance only as fast as said apron, but permitting free rolling of said carriage relative to said advancing apron and a segregation element, mounted on said carriage to move in and out of said path, said element normally extending into said path, in front of the leading flat in each successive, individual slug thereby to support said flats in upstanding position, but being retractable out of said path for reinsertion at a predetermined position.To accomplish the efficient flats handling operation, a secondary apron is provided in extension of the primary stacker apron and travelling at a slower speed so that the recumbent shingled flats are gradually raised to upstanding position on their lower edges. Preferably, a hold down belt and hold down roll contacts the upper edges of the flats as their upper edges rise upwardly to maintain alignment.Alongside the secondary apron is a guide in the form of a straight horizontal rod, parallel to the path of the flats, there being a carriage movable forwardly and rearwardly thereon by the contact of grooved rollers. Posts upstanding from the side carriage support a bracket which in turn supports a push rod, movable horizontally into, and out of, the path of the leading flat in the leading counted slug to engage it about mid height. A one way clutch in a roller which engages the secondary apron enables the carriage and rod to be advanced by the flats and apron, while prevented from forward fall by the push rod.When the operator places her left hand on the leading flat she can withdraw the push rod, move the carriage in the direction of retraction, reinsert it in a predetermined position such as in front of. the next successive counted slug and inset her right hand with the rod to grasp and slide the slug forwardly off the apron. In another embodiment the roller in contact with the apron is in driving contact with a second roller in contact with the horizontal stacker platform through a one way clutch and a speed reduction mechanism or drive train. Thus, the carriage advances at a predetermined speed such as one third the speed of the apron to compress the flats after they have been edge stacked from longitudinal to lateral.The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a top plan view of a carriage of the invention alongside a secondary stacker apron Fig. 2 is a side elevation thereof Fig. 3 is an end elevation from the front thereof with the roller in half section Fig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 1 of another embodiment Fig. 5 is a view similar to Fig. 2 of the embodiment shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 3 of the embodiment shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic perspective view on a reduced scale showing a secondary apron, hold down means, carriage and rod of the invention Fig. 8 is a side elevation view Fig. 6t is a side elevation view of the belt Pig. 9 is a diagrammatic perspective view similar to Fig. 7 showing the continuous stacker apron.As is best shown In Fig. 7, the primary apron 21, of the stacker 22, receives folded and glued collapsed boxes of trays, such as 23, called flats herein, from a foldergluer, not shown, and advances them in straight line, shingled formation, along the horizontal path 24. In this invention, a secondary stacker 25, is provided with a secondary stacker apron 26, in straight line extension of apron 21, along path 24, the apron 26 being driven by the drive of apron 21, not shown, at a speed less than the predetermined speed of the primary apron 21.As the lower edge 27 of each successive individual flat 23 drops into the apron nip 28, formed between end roll 29 of apron 21 and entrance roll 31 of apron 25, to encounter the slower moving secondary apron 26, the upper edge 32 of each flat 23, rises in an are as shown until the flat is upstanding on its lower edge 27.Preferably, a hold down belt 33, trained around hold down rolls 34 and 35, is provided to exert a downward force on the upper edges 32 of each flat 23, and maintain them in alignment while holding them down. The hold down belt 3 is driven by the drive of apron 21, in a well known manner, and its lower stretch 36 advances at a greater speed than the predetermined speed of the apron 21, to assist in frictionally raising the flats 23 to upstanding, edge supported position. The conventional folder gluer includes mechanism which automatically kicks out every fiftieth flat, such as at 37, 58, and 39, laterally sidewise from the shingled line 41 of flats to provide a visual count of individual and successive slugs of flats, each precounted to fit in a packing case when slightly compressed lengthwise.Each individual and successive slug 42, 43 or 44 may be precounted into any number of flats 23, desired, the number fifty being selected herein for convenience of description, it being understood that each run of flats may be as small as folded toothbrush boxes to as large The size and overlaps of such boxes make considerable difference in the ability of an operator to carry a lift thereof without dropping the lift on the floor so that in the prior art several trips and lifts may be required to constitute a single counted slug forming a single layer in a packing case.In this invention, however, the slug is slidably supported all the way to the packing case so that an operator can grasp the leading flat 45 with the left hand, the trailing flat 46, of the endmost counted slug with the right hand and slide it forwardly along the horizontal path 24, and into the case, as an integral unit with no danger of dropping the slug.The count divider apparatus 47, of the invention includes the guide means 48, which extends alongside the secondary stacker apron 26, in parallelism with the horizontal path 24, of the line 41 of flats 23, advancing along the path on the apron. Preferably, guide means 48, is an elongated guide or rod 49 attached at each opposite end by clamp blocks such as 51 and 52, to an existing take up piece 53, of the secondary stacker 25, to extend parallel therewith at a spaced distance laterally therefrom.The rod 49, thus forms a track for two pairs 54 and 55, of grooved track rolls 56, 57, 58 and 59, mounted under the horizontal elongated plate 61, of the carriage, or side car 62, so that the carriage 62 will move horizontally along the guide 49, in parallelism with path 24.As is best shown in Fig. 1, the carriage plate 61, is provided with a pair of laterally extending, longitudinally spaced apart slots 63 and 64, for clamps 65 and 66, so that the plate 61, can be moved laterally to any desired location relative to apron 26 to accommodate flats of various dimensions while still being guided on rod 49.A pair of longitudinally spaced apart, upstanding posts 67 and 68 are provided on elongated plate 61, each having a split clamp 69 or 71 thereon, tightenable by a handle 72 or 73, for adjustment at a preferred height above plate 61, which is usually about mid height of the upstanding leading flat 45. The split clamps 69 and 71 support the longitudinally extending member 74, tightenable therein by clamp handle 75, and carrying the yoke, or bracket 76 for laterally slidable or pivotable push rod or member 77, with its pointed terminal end 78. The push rod 77 is a segregation element, mounted on carriage 62, to move transversely and horizontally in and out of path 24.Rod 77 normally extends into the path in front of the leading flat 45, in each successive, individual slug at about mid height to support the flats in upstanding position while not interfering with manual grasping of the slug.Roller means 79, is provided on carriage 62, in the form of at least one roller 81, journalled at 82, to an integral inner wall 83, upstanding from plate 61, and having a friction face 84 in rolling contact with secondary apron 26. Preferably, a second roller 85 is provided and is also similar to roller 81. The face 84 is preferably of rubber, and preferably a weight 86 is provided to assure a firm contact of roller to apron.One way clutch means 87 forms part of roller means 79, and includes at least one one way clutch 88, built in to roller 81, and preferably a similar one way clutch 89, bullt in to roller 85, Fig.l . The one way clutch means 87, permits the leading flat 45 to bear against the push rod 77, without advancing the rod 77 or carriage 62 relative to the apron 26, thereby maintaining the leading slug 42 upright ready for grasping by the operator.However, when the operator places the left hand on the leading flat, the push rod 77 can be retracted horizontally, the carriage 62 will roll freely in the direction of retraction toward the next successive slug 43, and the push rod 77 can have its point 78 inserted at the fifty first flat 23 to hold it upright, while the operator slides the endmost slug 42 forwardly along path 24 and into a packing case. Thus, the one way clutches 88,89 permit the carriage 62 to retract freely on the apron 26, but prevents advance of the carriage 62 on the apron 26.The embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 is similar to the preferred embodiment of Figs. 1, 2 and 3, except that the roller means 79 includes an additional roller 91, in rolling contact with the horizontal, elongated, portion 92 of the stacker platform 93, which extends under the secondary apron 26, for supporting the apron against sag. The additional roller 91 has a friction face 94, and is journalled at 95 in a longitudinally extending slot 96, in a lever 97 pivoted on a laterally extending shaft 98. The friction face 84 of roller 81 is in rolling contact with secondary apron 26, and is fast on shaft 98.Speed reduction mechanism 99 is provided in the form of a sheave 101 which is driven by shaft 98 and is in driving contact with the additional roller 91, through a one way clutch 102, the sheave 101 being of predetermined less diameter than the diameter of roller 81. Thus, the advance of the apron 26, at a predetermined speed, rotates the roller 81 at that speed, which in turn rotates the additional roller 91, for example at one third of that speed, so that the carriage 62 and push rod 77 hold back and compress the line of flats 41 on the secondary apron 26, as well as holding the leading flat 45 upstanding on lower edge 27.The compression of the flats 23, in the line of flats 41, is sometimes necessary when the flats 23 being run on the folder gluer are narrow and elongated, such as tooth brush boxes 103, such boxes being advanced along the paper line of the folding and gluing zones while extending longitudinally thereof, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 7. When such flats 103 reach the stacker they must be turned by a turning plow 104, to extend laterally and transversely of the stacker apron 26 as at 105, in order to be shingled in a manageable manner for handling and packing. Having been so turned by the edge stacker, or plow 104, the resulting line of flats 41 is loosely packed and a slug to fit a case would be too long to be capable of being grasped by an operator. It is for that reason that the invention includes the step of slowing down the advance of the flats 23 relative to the speed of the apron 26 to compress the line of flats 41 into manageable slugs, easily handled by an operator as a bodily transportable, slidable unit.As shown in Fig. 8 the preferred form of hold down belt 33 is at least one elongated alignment belt 106 trained around sheaves 107, 108 and 109, and having tension control sheaves 113, 114 and ill5. Alignment belt 106 includes a lower stretch advancing in the direction of advance of the shingled flats 23 on primary apron 21, with a first portion at a spaced uniform distance above the level of primary apron 21, and a second portion inclined upwardly and forwardly to a level substantially equal to the height of an erected flat 23 upstanding on its lower edge 27 on secondary apron 26.An endless belt 110 trained around sheaves Ill and 112 is also provided, with its lower stretch in contact with the upper edges 32 of the shingled flats 23. The inclined portion of alignment belt 106 raises the upper edges 32 of the shingled flats 23 as the slower running secondary apron 26 slows the advance of the lower edges 27, thereby raising the flats 23 to an upstanding, erect position as shown. The belt nip 119 between the primary apron 21 and the secondary apron 26 assists in pivoting the flats upright. As shown in Fig. 8A, the belt 106 is formed of an inner layer 117 of fabric such as canvas and an outer layer 118 of rubber like material, the outer layer 118 having a plurality of spaced transverse ribs, ridges or knobs to increase the contact with the upper edges of the flats 23.Fig. 9 is similar to Fig. 7 except that it shows that a continuous stacker apron 123 can be used with the edge stacker, or plow 104, rather than a primary and secondary apron 21, 26 separated by a nip 28.
