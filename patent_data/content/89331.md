# Manufacture of ortho methyl anilines from ortho amino benzyl sulfoxides.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of orthomethyl anilines from ortho amino benzyl sulfoxides. An ortho amino benzyl sulfoxide is converted to an ortho amino benzyl halide by reaction with a nonoxidizing acid halide and is recovered from the reaction medium as an anilinium salt. After redissolving, the ortho amino benzyl halide is hydrode halogenated to form an ortho methyl aniline.
