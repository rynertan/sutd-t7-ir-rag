# Curable resin compositions.

## Abstract
A curable resin composition which comprises 1 a copolymer composed of an aminoalkyl acrylate and or aminoalkyl methacrylate and an ethylenically unsaturated monomer being formulated with 2 a compound having at least two acryloyl groups in the molecule. The composition can be cured at low temperatures in the range of ordinary temperature to 120 C, and therefore advantageously used for the formation of coating films in the application fields, such as plastics, wood and concrete, where heat treatment cannot be performed. Also, the composition which exhibits excellent adherence toward various kinds of substrates can be used as adhesives and different kinds of primers, as well. Furthermore, the com position can provide coating films that excel in terms of water resistance, weathering resistance and solvent resist ance, and therefore be utilized for overpaints, etc.
