# Drive arrangement between non aligned shafts.

## Abstract
A drive arrangement between two non aligned shafts 10, 12 utilises a hollow, floating intermediate shaft 14 couples at its two ends to the shafts. Each coupling is provided by claw rings 16, 17a, 17b mounted at the end of each shaft coaxial therewith. The teeth of the claw ring 17a on the first shaft 10 lie between those of a claw ring 16 on the intermediate shaft, and a similar arrangement obtains at the second end of the shaft. Driving engagement is provided by a toothed ring 22 of elastomeric material whose teeth 24 occupy the spaces between the teeth 18, 20 of the claw rings. To cool the elastomeric material, an impeller disk 30 draws air through the couplings and the intermediate shaft 14 . The claw ring 17b on the second shaft 12 is mounted by means of a split sleeve clamp 26 which when loosened permits axial movement of the claw ring 17b and of the intermediate shaft 14 . The couplings can then be disen gaged and the intermediate shaft 14 removed.
