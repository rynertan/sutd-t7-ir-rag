## Description
Ignition System This invention relates to improvements in ad relating to apparatus for producing spark ignition of an internal comb stion engine. It is veil knofl that the electrical sparks fed to the spark plugs of an internal combustion engine are comventionally produced by means of an ignition soil having its high voltage secondary winding connected to the engine s spark plugs through a distributor, and having its low veltage primary winding connected to a low voltage sour e, typically a 12 volt battery or an alternator drivom by the engine. An engine driven switching device, typically a mechanical contact breaker, produces interruptions in the current flowing in the coil s primary winding and consequently high voltage pulses are produced in the coil s secondary winding, which are applied te the spark plugs. Resently, a proposal has been made to increase the energy of the sparks applied to the spark plugs, by connecting a capa itor t the primary coil of the winding, charging the capacitor to a voltage much higher than the conventienal IS volt supply voltage froM the ngine s battery and alternator, and discharging the capacitor through the coil s primary winding each time a spark is required.With such an arrangement, the total spark energy for each firing of a sylinder of the engine is increased substantially with respect to the conventional spark ignition apparatus, but the duration of the spark. produced by the arrangement is nuch l ss than those produced by the conventional apparatus. Such shorter sparks can prove disadvantageous with certain engines and certain engine operating conditions, particularly but not exclusively with large capacity racing engines, V 12 cylinder ongines for example. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for producing spark ignition of an internal combustion engine, which akes use of the capacitive discharge aforementioned but which provides electrical pulses for producing spark ignition of an increased duration with respect to that of the prior proposal. In accordance with the present invention there is provided an apparatus for producing spark ignition of an internal combustion engine, comprising an ignition coil having primary and secondary indin, r capacitor connected in an electrical circuit with the primary winding, voltage generating means for receiving a supply voltage and charging said capacitor to a voltage greater than said supply voltage, switching seans arranged to cause the capacitor to discharge a currant through the priaary winding of the coil, the apparatus being 5. arranged that the discharge current of the capacitor oscillates in the said circuit, and control circuit means adapted to operate the switching means to produce said discharge current in such a manner that more than one oscillation of the current passes through the primary winding whereby to induce in the secondary winding more than one cycle of an oscillatory voltage for producing spark ignition of the engine. Preferably, the voltage generating means comprises a d.c. to d.c. converter for producing from low voltage input supply ot typically 12 volts of r battery or alternator, a high charging voltage, of typically 200 volts, for the capacitor. Preferably, the switching means comprises a thyristor and the control circuit means is responsive to operation of a contact breaker which may be of the conventional mechanical kind or of the more recently developed photocell or magnetically operated types.The control circuit is arranged to trigger the thyristor into conduction each tie a spark is required, and to hold the thyristor in a conductive state for More than one oscillation of the discharge current of the capacitor, thereby producing in the secondary winding an oscillatory voltage of More than one cycle. The oscillatory voltage can be arranged to continue for substantially the whole operative firing period of each cylinder of the engine thereby producing improved combustion of the RTI ID 3.28 fuel air mixture as compared with the shorter duration sparks produced by the prior proposal. Conveniently, the control circuit means is arranged to reduce the duration of conduction of the thyristor as the speed of the engine increases, so as to prevent the duration of sparking from extending from the firing period of one cylinder into the firing period of another cylinder. A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention includes an ignition coil having primary and secondary winding, a capacitor connected in electrical circuit with the primary winding, voltage generating means for receiving a supply voltage and adapted to charge the capacitor to a voltage greater than said supply voltage, a thyristor connected in said circuit and arranged so that when fired to a conductive state the capacitor discharges in an oscillatory manner through the thyristor and the secondary winding, and control circuit means adapted to apply to the gate of the thyristor a firing signal to render the thyristor conductive for a period sufficient for r plurality ot oscillations of the capacitor discharge current to pass through aid primary winding, md means for inhibiting said voltage generating leans froM charging the capacitor during the discharge thereof produced by firing of the thyristor. When the capacitor is discharged by firing the thyristor, as oscillatory current is established in the circuit, the peak magnitude of the current decreasing with successive oscillations thereof. The particularly preferred form of the apparatus of the invention includes leans for inhibiting operation of the voltage generating means during discharge of the capacitor, which has the advantage of permitting substantially the entire stored energy established in the capacitor to be RTI ID 4.38 dissipated through the primary winding to generate in the secondary winding a voltage for producing spark ignition. Without the inhibiting cans aforesaid, the firing pulse applied to the thyristor would have to be terminated before the peak oscillatory capacitor disoharge current became less than the current supplied to the capacitor by the voltage generating means during the capacitor discharge, other wise the thyristor would be held in a permanently conduct ing state thereby preventing the capacitor from being recharged for further operations of the apparatus. Thus, the inhibiting means permits the thyristor to be maintained conductive for a longer period than would otherwise be possible. Further features and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description of mbdiments thereof given by way of illustrative example with refer once to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure I is a schematic circuit diagram of an apparatus in accordance with the invention Figure 2 illustrates a sparking waveform developed by the apparatus of the invention in comparison with sparking waveforms of the prior apparatus aforementioned, and Figure 3 illustrates a modification of the circuit shown in Figure 1. Referring now to Figure 1, the apparatus Co. prises a conventional ignition coil 1 having a primary winding 1a, and a second winding 1b connected through a conventional distributor 2 to spark plugs 3 of the engine.The primary winding la is connected in series with a capacitor C1 and r switching thyristor SCR, which together define a tuned oscillatory circuit when the thyristor SCR is conductive. The capacitor C1 is charged to a voltage of typically 200 volts by means of a d.c. to d.c. converter 4 shown in dotted outline. The converter 4 is fed with a d.c. voltage of typically 12 volt. from an input terminal 5, connected in use to the engine s battery and alternator system not shown . The thyristor SCR is triggered by a an of a control circuit 6, responsive to r contact breaker not shown either of the conventional mechanical or the photocall type. Considering now the d.8. to d.c. conyerter. 4 in more d tail, it comprises a step up transformer 7 having primary coils 8a, 8b and a secondary coil 9. The primary coils 8 are connected in a push pull transistor oscillator arrangement which includes two sets of transistors TRI,TR2 TR3, TR4 connected as complementary Darlington each pair supplying current to a respective one of the coils 8a, 8b, A pickup coil 8c is connected to supply positive feedback to the transistors, and a diode arrangement D1 to D4 is provided to bias the transistor pairs into conduction, the diodes being arranged so that when one of the Darlington pairs is switched on, the other is biased off and vise versa.A d.c. bias current is applied to the transistor pairs through a bias current path 4A which includes a voltage dropping resistor R.In operation of the oscillator, current is fed. through the coils 8a, 8b sequentially and in opposite directions at a frequency which is a function of the i inductance of chokes LI, La, the values of a resistor R1 and a capacitorC2, and the inductance preserved by the primary coils 8a, 8b, thereby inducing a stepped up alternating voltage in the secondary coil 9.The output of the coil 9 is applied to a bridge rectifier 10 and thence to smoothing arrangement comprising registers R2, R3 and a capacitor C3. Thus, in use, the d.c. to d.c. converter 4 applies a stepped up d.c. voltage of typically 200 volts to the capacitor C1. The control circuit 6 for the switching thyristorSCR will now be described in more detail. The control circuit has a 7.5 volt stabilised voltage rail 11 established from the 12 volt supply terminal by a resistor R4 and a Zener diode ZD. The contact breaker of the engine not shown is connected between a terminal 12 connected to the supply rail 11 and a terminal 13 which is connected to the base of a transistor Tas connected as an emitter follower.The transistor TR5 is provided with a biasing resistor chain including resistor R5, R6, R7. A smoothing network including r capacitor C4 and a diode D5 is provided to remove unwanted switching transients produced by the contact breaker. The output of the transistor TR5 thus comprises a chain of pulses the frequency of which is a function of the engine speed, the phase of the pulses being indicative of the desired timing of the sparks to be produced by the spark plugs. The output of the transistor TR5 is applied to two signal paths. The first path includes a capacitor C5.The electrical charge of each pulse is dumped in turn into the capaeitor C5 which then discharges between pulses through series resistors R8, R9, resistor RIO and the collector emitter path of a transistor TR6.A drive transistor TR7 has its base connected to the junction between the series resistors R8, R9, and is arranged, when switched on, to apply a stitching drive signal to the gate of the thyristor SCR. The transistor TR7 will switch off when the capacitor C5 has discharged to a voltage sufficient to allow an appropriate bias voltage to be developed across the resistor R9, and thus the thyristor SCR is switched on in response to each pulse in the pulse train from the contact breaker end for a time dependent upon the discharge time of the capacitor C5. This discharge time is arranged to decrease with increased engine speed. To this end, the pulse signal train from tha transistor TR5 is applied to a second signal path. including a differentiator comprising a capacitor c6 and a resistor Rii, a diode pump circuit including r diode D6, a resistorR12 end a capacitor C7, and biasing resistors R13, R14. These components effectively differentiate the pulse chain from transistor TR5 and produce a d.c. voltage of magnitude dependent upon thr froquency of the pulses i.e.the engine speed. This voltage is applied to the base of the transistor TR6 so as to decrease its collector emitter impedance with increasing engine speed, so as to increase the rate of discharge of capacitor C5 with increased engine speed. As a result, the time for which the thyristorSCR is switched on, is decr ased with increased engine speed so as to prevent the high voltage signal produced in the secondary winding 1b of the coil for a particular cylinder firing extending in time into the time appropriate for firing of another cylinder. As previously mentioned, the capacitor C1 and the winding 1a of the ignition coil define a tuned circuit, so that when the thyristor SCR is fired, the capacitor C1 discharges current in an oscillatory manner. The control circuit is arranged to hold the thyristorSCR conductive for a period which corresponds to substan tially all of the firing period of a cylinder, and during that period, the oscillatory current flowing in primary winding Is and the capacitor Cl induces in the secondary winding a plurality of cycles of high voltage signal having the frequency of the oscillation of the current flowing through the primary winding.I have found that this high voltage signal typically of the order of 3,500 volts produces an improved combustion in the cylinders because the spark produced by the spark plug extends for substantially the whole period that combustion can take place thereby maximising the likelihood of complete combustion of the fuel air mixture applied to the engine. In order to allow substantially all of the charge established oa the capacitor Cl to be dissipated through the primary winding 1a of the coil, the apparatus includes inhibiting moans to be described hereinafter for inhibiting operation of the d.c. to d.c. converter 4.during periods when the thyristor SCR is triggered into a conductive state, so as to stop a charging current being applied to the capacitor C1 whilst it is being discharged.Now, it will be appreciated that the discharge current of the capacitor will have an oscillatory waveform of which the peak magnitude decays with time in 9 exponential manner. When the firing pulse applied to the gate of the thyristor SCR terminates to terminate the conductive state of the thyristor, it is essential by virtue of the well known operating characteristics of the thyristor, that the current flowing in the thyristor be decreased below a predetermined level in order for the thyristor to return to a non conductive state.Without the inhibiting means, a 1Lit would be set on the period for which the thyristor could be triggered conductive by a pulse from the control circuit 4, because after the thyristor has been fired and at a time when the capacitor C1 has become partially discharged, the sum of the charging current from the converter 4 and the decaying oscillatory discharge current would reach a level which would no longer pass below the threshold value required to switch off the thyristor SCR. However, in the present embodiment, the inhibiting means is provided to effectively switch off the charging current supplied to the capacitor C1 by the converter 4 whilst the capacitor is being discharged, which permits the firing pulses applied by the circuit 4 to the thyristor SCR to be mad. longer than would otherwise be possible and still ensure that the thyristor will reliably turn off at the end of the firing pulse.The inhibiting means thus permits the thyristor SCR to b turned on for a period which allows substantially all the oscillatory current produced by discharge of the capacitorC1 to be used to generate spark ignition. The inhibiting means of the present embodiment is an inherent feature of the particular arrangement of the converter 4 shown in Figure 1. As previously mentioned, the frequency of oscillation of the transistors r TR1 4 is determined in pert by the inductance presented 0 by the primary coils 8a, 8b. when the thyristor is in a non conductive state, the inductance presented by the primary coils 8a, 8b is a function of the self inductance of the primary coils and also the mutual inductance of the primary and secondary coils 8 and 9. However, when the thyristor SCR is fired into a conductive state, the ends of the secondary coil 9 are short circuited.The trans former 7 is so arranged that upon short circuiting of the secondary coil 9, the mutual inductance of the coils 8, 9 is reduced substantially by allowing flux from the prirary to leak out of the transformer. As a result, the inductance presented to the transistor oscillator by the coils 8a, 8b is reduced substantially when the thyristor SCR is fired, which causes the frequency of oscillation of the oscillator to increase substantially. The transformer 7 is however extremely inefficient at the higher frequency and as a result substantially no charging current is induced in the secondary coil 9 whilst the thyristor SCR is conductive.The operation of the transformer 7 and the transistor oscillator wha the thyristor SCR is in it. conductive state can also be understood in terms of the leakage inductance of the transformer. Leakage inductance is effectively the prior portion of flux generated by one coil that does not inter sect the others, and can be considered as a small indu tor in series with the main winding.When the secondary coil 9 is short circuited, the converter operates at a frequency and power level determined by the value of.this leakage inductance. The leakage inductance is preferably increased by winding the secondary coil on a bobbin first, followed by r relatively large inter winding separation of about 0.025 , which also provides primary secondary insulation, followed by the primary coil which is wound Bifiler to ensure good balance. This ensures that when the secondary is short circuited, the output current ia typically less than ao m.a. As soon as the thyristor SCR returns to its non conducting state, the short circuit is removed and the d.c. to d.c. converter 5 operates normally, charging up the capacitor C1 for the next spark. Another example of the apparatus is shown inFigure 3, which has a different form of inhibiting aeans. Most of the circuit is the same as that shown in Figure 1 and like parts are marked with like reference numerals.Only those parts of the circuit which differ from those of Figure 2 will be described hereinafter. The circuit of Figure 3 includes a further voltage dropping resistor R13 connected in the d.c.bias current supply path 4A, and a bias current by pass path 14 connected to the path 4A between the resistors R R13. The path 14 is connected to the positive side of the thyristor SCR and includes a diode 07 arranged to prevent the charging current from the rectifier 10 from passing to the transistor oscillator.Thus, when the thyristor ssR is fired into its conductive state, the path 14 provides a low impendance path to earth through the thyristor SCR for the bias current for the transistors TR1 4 of the oscillator, and thus the bias current preferentially flows to earth through the by pass current path i4 rather than to the transistors, which results in the transistors being turned off. Hence, the oscillator is turned off whilst tho thyristor SCR is in its conductive state, so as to inhibit charging of the capacitor C1 whilst it is being discharged. The elongation of the high frequency signal produced by the described examples of apparatus of the invention as compared with the prior arrangements can be seen clearly from Figure 2. All of the graphs of Figure 2 illustrate the output voltage developed across the secondary winding of the coil when a spark is produced. Figure 2A illustrating the output of a conventional contact breaker system, Figure 2B illustrating the prior proposed capacitive discharge system, and Figure 2C illustrating the output waveform of the described example of the present invention. The operative spark generating periods are illustrated with shaded lines on the graphs.It will be seen that the spark period of the capacitive discharge period of Figure 2B is much shorter than the prior system of Figure aA but has a much faster rise tine. It willbe furthermore noted that the described apparatus of the present invention provides not omly the shorter period rise time but also provides a substantially elongated spark generation period. I have found that the apparatus of the present invention makes a much or efficient use of the charge established on the charged capacitor, as compared with the prior proposal, by letting the charge dissipate during the whole of r cylinder firing period. The apparatus of the invention has been described by way of example used with a mechanical contact breaker, but it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that a photoelectric or like non mechanical contact breaker system can be connected to the terminals 12, 13.Many other modifications and variations of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope of the present invention as claimed hereinafter.
