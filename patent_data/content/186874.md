## Abstract
Method of and apparatus for checking the geometry of multi layer patterns f, g for IC structures having identical functions, each of the multi layer patterns including layer pat terns arranged in different level layers, wherein electrical im age signal corresponding to any two of the multi layer patterns and having more than two levels are registered 15, 18 20 30 with each other and then compared 21 31 to determine un matched and matched portions. The comparison of the regis tered electric image signals may be performed with respect to their amplitude or their gradients. The registration and compar ison of two electric image signals may be repeated for all of the layer patterns, with the matched portions being no longer sub jected to the registration and comparison 24 . A defect detec tion signal is produced from finally unmatched portions, if any, of the electric image signals having undergone the said regis tration and comparison.
