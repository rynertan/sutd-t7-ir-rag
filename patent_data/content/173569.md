# Receiver unit having synchronous pull in circuit.

## Abstract
In a receiver unit such as a MODEM, a synchronous pull in circuit is formed. The synchronous pull in circuit com prises a transversal filter 4 having a roll off characteristic, a timing discriminator 6 for extracting a timing signal con tained in a received signal and a decision part 7 for detect ing a phase deviation between the thus extracted timing sig nal and an internal clock by which the receiver unit is syn chronized. The roll off filter 4 is provided with a plurality of taps, the tap coefficients of which are varied by the decision part 7 via line L‚ÇÅ in accordance with the phase deviation derived by the decision part 7 , so that the timing signal is synchronized with the internal clock.
