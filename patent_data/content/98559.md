# Solid state color imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
Solid state imaging apparatus comprises a plurality of photoelectric elements disposed in arrays, where picture ele ments of odd number horizontal lines and those of even num ber horizontal lines are disposed shifted each other by half pic ture element pitch, and substantially vertical stripe shaped col or filter elements are disposed repeating in horizontal direction with 1¹ ₂ pitches of the picture element, thus spatial phase of the color filter elements between neighboring horizontal lines of the picture elements differs by 180 , thereby enabling more effective utilization of the vertical correlation of the image.
