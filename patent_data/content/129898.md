# Clutch and transmission brake assembly.

## Abstract
A clutch and transmission brake assembly which can be readily incorporated into existing vehicle drive trains without undue modification. The assembly includes a wet clutch 10 connectable to a flywheel 12 and a transmission brake 16 located between the wet clutch and a transmission housing 14 . The clutch and transmission brake are hydraulically operated by annular pistons 56, 118 under the control of pressure responsive valves 202, 204 which are operated sequentially by cams 268, 270 . These cams are intercon nected with a pedal linkage 250, 256, 260 in such a manner that the clutch 10 is progressively disengaged as the pedal 250 is moved from an initial position A towards a dwell position B . Further depression of the pedal results in the pedal moving through a dwell period B C before the brake is progressively applied as the pedal moves from dwell position C to a fully depressed position D . The pedal effort is arranged to increase as the pedal moves from the end of its dwell period towards the fully depressed position D .
