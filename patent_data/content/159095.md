# Automatic three speed winch.

## Abstract
An automatic three speed winch comprising a base plate 1 , a bollard 2 mounted for rotation relative to said base plate and carrying teeth 7 on its inner surface, arranged to cooperate through intermediate gears, with at least one driving gear 5, 6 around a central shaft 4 of the winch. An element 21, 22 is provided, which is mounted for rotation between a first and a second position about the central shaft 4 of the winch, which element carries three shafts 12, 14, 20 , with a pair of gears 8, 11 10,13 18, 19 being mounted for rotation about each shaft. The transition between the three different speeds takes place fully automatically by just changing the direction of rotation of the driving gear, without requiring any further operation on the winch.
