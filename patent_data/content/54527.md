# Improved electrolytic cell for magnesium chloride.

## Abstract
An improved electrolytic cell for magnesium chloride which essentially comprises at least one pairs of anode 5 and cathode 6 arranged with a respective principal face thereof in a substantial verticality, at least one bipolar intermediate electrode 7 placed in a row between the anode 5 and cathode 6 , an electrolytic chamber 2 to contain such electrodes, and a metal collecting chamber which is attached to the electroly tic chamber but separated therefrom by a partition, characte rized in that said intermediate electrodes 7 essentially consists of a substantially flat graphite portion 12 to provide an anodic face and an iron portion 13 to provide a cathodic face, both materials being spaced from each other and jointed together with rods of iron, which are tightly secured to the graphite, to ensure an intimate electrical connection therebetween, and that a cavity thus formed between the two materials is arranged to fitly communicate at one end with a through hole in the partition to allow passage of electrolyte bath carrying magnesium metal product from the electrolytic chamber 2 to the metal collecting chamber.
