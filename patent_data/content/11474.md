# Hot melt composition.

## Abstract
The composition comprises a tackifier and a polymer having a melt index at 230 C not exceeding 500, the polymer being formed by reacting an unsaturated carboxylic acid, or derivative thereof, with an ethylene alpha olefin copolymer rubber, and, optionally, partially esterifying the resulting polymer. The polymer forms 30 to 70 of the composition, based on the weight of the polymer plus tackifier. The compositions, which are useful as hot melt adhesives, are also pressure sensitive.
