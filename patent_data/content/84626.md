# High speed search system.

## Abstract
It is described a system for searching digitized data contained in a data store at a high speed. Several queries may be processed simultaneously and the search for each query may be limited to specified portions of the records contained in the data store, e.g. only head notes, or only the bodies of the texts. The system produces a list of records which have satisfied a query. If this list is too lengthy, a refinement of the query may be required for a re search, and the records to be searched may be limited to those previously listed.
