## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel 6,9a epoxy prostenoic acids and esters and to 6,9a epoxy l hydroxymethyl prostenes, the alkyl ethers and the ketones thereof, as well as to the cyclopentenone intermediates and processes for their preparation. The novel compounds of this invention embrace all the possible optical isomers, diastereomers and enantiomers, racemates, and racemic mixtures. Description of the Prior Art Prostaglandins have classically been described as chemically related 20 carbon chain hydroxy fatty acids having the basic skeleton of prostanoic acidEMI1.1 The prostaglandins having a hydroxyl group at theC ll position and a keto group at the C 9 position are known as the PGE series, and those having a hydroxyl group in place of the keto group are known as the PGF series and are further designated by an a or ss suffix to indicate the configuration of the hydroxyl group at said position. The natural compounds are the a hydroxyl substituted compounds..They may contain different degrees of unsaturation in the molecule, particularly at C 5, C 13 and C 17, the unsaturation is also indicated by a suffix. Thus, for example, the GF1 and PGE1 series refer to prostanoic acids having a trans olefin bond at the C 13 position, while the PGF2 and PGE2 series refer to prostadienoic acids having a cus olefin bond at the C S position and a trans olefin bond at the C 13 position. For a review on prostaglandins and the definition of primary prostaglandins, see, for example, P. Ramwell, The Prostaglandins, pp. 5 22 1973 . The preparation of derivatives of prostanoic acid has become of great importance since the demonstration of the highly interesting range of biological and pharmacological activities of natural prostaglandins. The great majority of these studies have focused on modification of the two side chains, or modifications of the substituents attached to the cyclopentane moiety see, for example, U. Axen et al., Synthesis Vol. 1, JohnWiley and Sons Inc., New York, New York 1973 and P. H.Bentley, Chem. Soc. Reviews 2, 29 1973 . The synthesis of prostaglandin analogs possessing a 3 oxa or ll deoxy 3 thia moiety have been described, among others in U.S. Patent No. 3,873,607 U.S. Patent No.3,950 406 Netherlands Patent 7305222 Q U.S. Patent No.3,944,593 U.S. Patent No. 3,931,289 and U.S. Patent No.3,936,487. The synthesis of several prostaglandin analogswherein the hydroxyl group at C 15 has been removed and a hydroxyl group has been introduced at C 16 has appeared see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,950,406 Prostaglandins, Vol. 10, 733 1975 Tetrahedron Letters, No. 48, 4217 1975 1.

The compounds of this invention can be prepared by a 1,4 conjugate addition procedure involving treatment of the ether blocked cyclopentenone such as 111 with a lithio cuprate reagent such as it7 , 118 , or 119 prepared as illustrated in Flowsheets A through N. These processes and many of the intermediates useful for the preparation of the compounds of formula I are set forth in some detail in U.S. Application SerialNumber 3,953, filed January 16, 1979, incorporated herein by references. The 1,4 conjugate addition procedure is described hereinbelow in Flowsheet N. The preparation of the various requisite l iodo trans l alkenyl or l tributyl stannyl trans l alkenyl derivatives is illustrated inFlowsheets A H and the methods of preparation of the 4 hydroxycyclopentenones embracing the l hydroxymethyl l oxo chain is described in connection with Flowsheets I M. FLOWSHEET AEMI24.1 FLOWSHEET A CONT. EMI25.1 wherein f is one or two inclusive. In accordance with the scheme. as outlined hereinabove in Flowsheet A, carbethoxycyclobutane or carbethoxycyclopentane is converted to its enolate anion 2 by treatment with a strong base such as lithium cyclohexylisopropylamide, prepared from the corresponding amine and n butyl lithium hexane solution in a solvent, such as anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, at very low temperatures, such as 78 C. The resulting enolate anion 2 is then alkylated with R6 X 3 to provide 4 , the ester group of which is reduced to alcohol 5 by reaction with 2 equivalents of diisobutyl aluminum hydride, lithium aluminum hydride or the like. Oxidation of alcohol 5 with dipyridine chromium oxide complex Reagents forOrganic Synthesis , L. F.Fieser and M. Fieser, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 4, 215 1974 , prepared in situ in methylene chloride.solution, provides the corresponding aldehyde 6 , which can also be obtained directly from ester 4 by partial reduction with one equivalent of diisobutyl aluminum hydride at 780C, but the former two step procedure is preferrable. Reaction of aldehyde 6 with lithium acetylide ethylenediamine complex provides the 3 hydroxy l alkyne 7 , which is converted to its trimethysilyl ether in the usual manner. The silylated derivative is then treated with disiamylborane prepared in situ in tetrahydrofuran solution at ice bath temperatures from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride ethereate and then anhydrous trimethylamine oxide. The resulting solution and an iodine solution in tetrahydrofuran are then added simultaneously to an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to give the l iodo 3 trimethylsilyloxy 4, 4 methylene l alkene 8 . Also, the above sequence of reactions can be accomplished, as shown in Flowsheet A, using R9CH2X where Rg is a phenyl group. EMI27.1 Flowshect B ContinuedEMI28.1 FLOWSHEET B ContinuedEMI29.1 FLOWSHEET B ContinuedEMI30.1 In accordance with the scheme as outlined hereinabove in Flowsheet B, l trimethylsilyl 3 tetrahydropyranyloxy l propyne 9 is treated with n butyllithium at 780C. and then with a freshly prepared solution of zinc iodide in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, also at 780C.Reaction of aldehyde 10 with the resulting reagent then provides the 4 hydroxy 3 tetrahydropyranyloxy 1 alkyne 11 .This reaction is stereo specific, the product 11 being in the erythro configuration. For additional information concerning this reaction see the examples which follow and F.Mercier, R. Epstein and S. Holland, Bull. Soc. Chim. France, 690 1972 . The tetrahydropyranyl group in 11 is removed on weak acid treatment. The resulting erythro diol 12 can be reblocked by treating with an appropriate aldehyde or 0 ., ketone Ra C Ra in the presence of strong acid catalyst in the usual way to give the ketal or acetal 13 . Acetone is a useful ketone for this purpose and the product 13 is then a 3,4 isopropylidenedioxy 1 alkyne. It is also possible to utilize silyl blocking groups introduced after removal of the l trimethylsilyl group to ultImately give the vinyl iodides 16 or 17 . Weak base treatment of 13 , for example, heating fro about one hour in refluxing methanol with potassium carbonate, results in desilylation to give 14 .The l alkene 14 is converted to the corresponding l iodo trans l alkene 15 by treatment with disamylborane prepared in situ in tetrahydrofuran solution at ice bath temperatures from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride ethereate and then anhydrous trimethylamine oxide. The resulting solution and and an iodine solution in tetrahydrofuran are then padded simultaneously to an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to give 15 . For the preparation of the threo derivatives, the 4 hydroxy 3 tetrahydropyranyloxy 1 alkyne 11 is acetylated to provide the corresponding 4 acetoxy derivative 18 . The tetrahydropyranyl group is preferentially hydrolized with weak acid to 19 , which is then tosylated in the usual manner to afford the erythro 3 tosyloxy 4 acetoxy l alkyne 20 . Solvolysis of 20 under essentially neutral condition by heating in aqueous tetrahydrofuran in the presence of an insoluble acid acceptor, such as calcium carbonate, results in inversion of C3, furnishing the threo 3 hydroxy 4 acetoxy 1 alkyne 21 , which is then deblocked with aqueous base to give the threo 3,4 diol 22 .Diol 22 is converted to an acetal or ketal 23 or a silyl derivative as in 16 or 17 and thence to the l iodo trans l alkene 16 as described hereinabove wherein Ra is C1 to C3 alkyl. For the preparation of the 16 alkoxyprostanoic acids of this invention, an erythro 4 hydroxy 3 tetra hydropyranyl oxy l alkyne 11 is desilyated by a methanol potassium carbonate treatment and the resulting 25 is alkylated to give the 4 alkoxy 3 tetrahydropyranyloxy l alkyne 26 . A useful procedure for this step involves treatment of 25 with a molar equivalent of sodium hydride to give the 4 alkoxide which is then alkylated with the appropriate alkyl halide alkylating agent, for example methyl iodide. The 4 alkoxy 1 alkyne 26 is then converted to the corresponding l iodo trans l alkene 27 as described hereinabove for the preparation 15 .If desired the tetrahydropyranyl blocking group in 27 can be hydrolyzed with weak acid and the resulting free 3 ol corresponding to 27 converted to the 3 trimethylsilyloxy derivative 28 , in the usual manner, wherein Rd is C1 to C3 alkyl. For the threo series, the tetrahydropyranyl group in the erythro 4 alkoxy l alkyne 29 is tosylated to give the erythro 3 tosyloxy 4 alkoxy l alkyne 30 . AnSn2 displacement reaction of 30 with reagents such as tetrahydroammonium formate results in inversion to the threo derivative 31 , saponification of which provides threo 3 hydroxy 4 alkoxy l alkyne 32 . Trimethylsilylation followed by the vinyl iodide conversion procedure described hereinabove furnishes the threo l iodo l alkene 33 wherein Rd is hydrogen or C1 to C3 alkyl. The 15 alkyl and or 16 alkyl derivatives of this invention can be prepared by substituting CH, .Si CrC EMI32.1 òr 9 and orEMI32.2 for 10 R5 alkyl of 1 to 3 carbons in Flowsheet B. In accordance with the procedure as outlined inFlowsheet C, an aldehyde 34 is treated with propargylic magnesium halide to form the homopropargylic alcohol 35 , which is converted to its trimethylsilyl ether in the usual manner. The silylated derivative is then treated with disiamylborane prepared in situ in tetrahydrofuran solution at ice bath temperature from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride ethereate and then anhydrous trimethylamine oxide. The resulting solution and an iodine solution in tetrahydrofuran are added simultaneously to a sodium hydroxide solution to give the l iodo 4 trimethylsilyloxy trans l alkene 36 , precursors for 16 hydroxy prostacyclins. The trimethylsilyl protecting froup is removed with mild acid and the resulting vinyl iodide alcohol is oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate to provide the lriodo 4 oxo trans 1 alkene 37 , which upon treatment with a Grignard reagent R13,gX provides the l iodo 4 hydroxy trans l alkene, which is silylated in the usual manner to provide the silyl ether 38 wherein Ril is a C3 to C7 alkyl or alkenyl group and R 13 is vinyl, cyclopropyl or ethyl. FLOWSlIEET CEMI33.1 FLOWSHEET C ContinuedEMI34.1 A preferred method for the preparation of vinyllithium precursor is also described in Flowsheet C.Treatment of t e requisite carboxylic acid 30 or 39a with the appropriate organolithium reagent Ri3Li orR 11Li respectively , wherein R 11 and R 13 are hereinabove defined, give the corresponding ketone 40 which upon treatment with propargylic magnesium halide provides the homopropargylic alcohol 41 which is converted to the trans vinylstannyl derivat ve by sequential treatment with chlorotrimethylsilane and tri n butyllithium at 0 temperature 0 a temperature of 10 C to 78 C generates the corres ponding vinyllithium reagent. FLOWSHEET DEMI34.2 In accordance with Flowsheet D hereinabove, the precursors for other 16 hydroxy prostaglandins are prepared by treating an appropriate aldehyde or ketone 43 with a propargylic magnesium halide to yield the requisite homopropargylic alcohol 44 . The alcohol is protected as a tritylether 45 for secondary alcohols or as a trimethylsilyl ether 45 for tertiary alcohols . These ethers are then converted to the appropriate transvinyliodide 46 by treatment with disiamylborane generated in situ from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride, and boron trifluoride, followed by treatment with trimethylamine oxide and then iodine and sodium hydroxide, wherein Ri5 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl Z is O C C6H5 3 when R5 is hydrogen and Z is O Si CH3 3 when Ri5 is methyl or ethyl Ri4 is selected from the group C3 to C5 alkyl, C3 to C 5 alkenyl andEMI35.1 wherein R7 is as described above with the proviso that when R14 isEMI35.2 the R 15 must be hydrogen.FLOWSHEET EEMI35.3 FLOWSHEET E CONTINUEDEMI36.1 The preparation of the precursors for the synthesis of 16 aryloxy congeners is described in accordance with Flowsheet E hereinabove. The aryl esters 49 are prepared by esterifying the commercially available acids or by treatment of ethyl bromoacetate with the appropriate phenol.The ester 49 is reduced to the aldehyde 50 which upon treatment with lithium acetylide or acetylene magnesium bromide provides the propargylic alcohol 51 . Treatment of the alcohol 51 with chlorotrimethylsilane followed by tri n butyltin hydride furnishes the requisite vinylstannyl derivative 53 .Similar treatment starting with substituted hydrocinnamaldehyde 50a provides the respective vinylstannyl derivative 53a . The preparation of the precursors for the synthesis of secondary 15 hydroxy congeners are described in the literature. The preparation of the precursor for 15 methyl 15 hydroxy is described in Flowsheet F hereinbelow.In accordance with Flowsheet F, an acid chloride, whereinR5 is hereinabove defined, is treated with acetylene and aluminum trichloride to provide the vinylchloride 55 which upon treatment with sodium iodine furnishes the vinyliodide 56 . Treatment of 56 with methylmagnesium halide followed by chlorotrimethylsilane gives the requisite protected vinyliodide 57 . FLOWSHEET FEMI37.1 The precursors for the novel compounds of this invnetion which have a ss chain represented by Formula KEMI37.2 wherein S, Y, Ta, n, and X are herein above defined is shown in Flowsheet G and Flowsheet H. FLOWSHEET F CONTINUEDEMI38.1 Flowsheet GEMI38.2 FLOWSHEET G CONTINUEDEMI39.1 In accordance with the scheme as outlined hereinabove in Flowsheet G a ketone 58 is reacted with aGrignard reagent 59 such as acetylene magnesium chloride 59, s O or propargyl magnesium bromide 59 , s 1, to give the acetylenic alcohol 60 . In those cases where X is not CH2 two isomeric acetylenic alcohols are formed. These isomers can be separated by procedures well known to the art including fractional crystallization, fractional distillation and various chromatographic procedures. The individual isomers can then be carried through the remaining reactions outlined in Flowsheet G. The acetylenic alcohol 60 is converted to its trimethylsilyl ether in the usual manner. The silylated derivative 61 is then treated with disiomaylborane prepared in situ in tetrahydrofuran solution at ice bath temperatures from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride and boron trifluoroide ethereate and then anhydrous trimethylamine oxide. The resulting solution and an iodine solution in tetrahydrofuran are then added simultaneously to an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to give the l iodo 3 trimethylsilyloxy trans 1 alkene 62 . 63 is prepared by the addition of tri nbutyl tin hydride to the acetylene 61 in the presence of bisazoisobutyronitrile followed by vacuum distillation at a high enough temperature about 170 C to isomerize any of the cis vinyl tin compound to the trans vinyl tin compound. Certain of the ketones 67 of this invention are prepared as indicated in Flowsheet H below FLOWSIIEET HEMI40.1 wherein n and m are as hereinabove defined and the moietyEMI41.1 represents a phenoxy group which is optionally substituted with one or more halogen, trifluoromethyl, and C1 to C4 alkoxy groups. As indicated in Flow sheet H the reaction of an epoxide 64 with a substituted or unsubstituted phenol 65 in the presence of a catalytic amount of aqueous sodium hydroxide and a phase transfer catalyst such as methyl tricapryly ammonium chloride and the like at 700 80 C gives the phenoxy substituted alcohol 66 which in turn is oxidized with an oxidizing reagent such as pyridinium chlorochromate in methylene chloride to give the phenoxy substituted ketone 6 . This ketone 67 is then carried through the reactions shown in FlowsheetG above. The other ketones 58 used in this invention are known in the literature or can be made by procedures well known to the art G. Lardelli, U. Lamberti, W. T. Walles and A. P. de Jonge, Rec. Trav. Chem. Pays Bas, 86 481 1967 Ng. Ph. Buu Hoi, T. B. Loc andNg. DatXuong., Bull. Soc. Chem. France, 174 1958 and G. H. Posner, Organic Reactions, 19, 1 1972 . The preparation of the cyclopentenones of this invention containing the hydroxyketone feature 68 a b where R1 is hydrogen or a hydroxy group can be accomplished in several ways one of which involves the conversion of the corresponding cyclopentenone containing a carboxylate function 69 a b to the respective hydroxy ketone analog 68 a b .. EMI42.1 Most of the cyclopentenone carboxylic acids 69 a b required for the purposes of this invention have been described in the literature or can be prepared by procedures quite analogous to those already described.appropriate references are provided herein. The synthesis of certain non reference requisite cyclopentenone carboxylic acids 69 a b is also described herein. The conversion of the cyclopentenone carboxylic acid 69 a b to the respective hydroxyketone analogs and the protection of these compounds for a conjugate addition reaction is described hereinbelow in FlowsheetsJ and K. For the rpeparation of cyclopentenones of the type 79 whereas Z is the group CH2CH CH CH2 3 or CE2 6 , the carboxylic acid 76 is converted to the acid chloride 77 by first forming the sodium salt with sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran THE and then reacting the resulting suspension with oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide DMF . The resulting acid chloride 77 , dissolved in ether, is then added dropwise to an ether solution containing two to three equivalents of diazomethane to produce the diazoketone 78 . The diazoketone can be hydrolyzed to the hydroxy ketone 79 by refluxing an ethereal solution in the presence of a dilute aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Alternately, the acid chloride 77 can be heated with two equivalents of a 1,1,2 tris tri C1 to C4 alkylsilyloxyethylene, preferably 1,1, 2 tris trimethyl silyloxyethylene at 900 1000 for 2 to 4 hours to produce compound 81 . Compound 81 can be readily hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to give the hydroxy ketone 79 by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran. Protection of the hydroxy ketoneefunction of 79 suitable for a conjugate addition reaction, can be accomplished in two ways. Ketalization of 79 with ethylene glycol is accomplished by refluxing a benzene or toluene solution of 79 and ethylene glycol into aDean Stark trap. The resulting ketal 82 is then treated with trimethylsilylchloride TMSC1 and imidazole in dimethylformamide DMF to give 83 which is suitably protected for a conjugate addition reaction. Alternatively 79 can be protected by reaction with a mixture of 2 methoxy l propene 84 and 2,2 dimethoxypropane 85 in benzene in the presence of an acid catalyst such as p toluenesulfonic acid to give the ketal 86 which is suitably protected for a conjugate addition reaction. FLOWSHEET JEMI44.1 The preparation of the 4 hydroxycyclopentenone intermediates 92 wherein Z is hereinabove defined is outlined in Flowsheet K below. The reaction of the hydroxy acid 87 with at least two equivalents of dimethyl t butylsilylchloride in the presence of imidazole in dimethylformamide at 30 40 C gives the bisdimethyl t butylsilated compound 88 . The carboxylated dimethyl t butylsilyl group can be selectively removed by treatment with acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran and water 4 2 1 to give the carboxylic acid 89 . The acid chloride 90 is prepared by first treating the acid 89 with sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to give the sodium salt. The resulting suspension of the sodium salt is then treated with oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide.Alternatively the acid chloride 90 can be prepared directly by the reaction of the acid 89 or the dimethyl t butylsilylester 88 with oxalyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide at OOC. The slow addition of an ethereal solution of the acid chloride 90 to an ethereal solution of two to three equivalents of diazomethane gives the diazoketone 91 which on acid hydrolysis gives the 4 hydroxycyclopentenone 92 containing the hydroxyketone function. Alternatively the acid chloride 90 can be heated with at least two equivalents of a 1,1,2 tristri C1 to C4 alkylsilyloxyethylene, preferably 1,1,2tris trimethylsilyloxylene, at 900 1100C in the absence of solvent to give 93 which is readily hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to give the 4 hydroxycyclopentenone 92 containing the hydroxyketone feature. Protecting of 92 can be accomplished by treatment with an excess mixture of 2 methoxy 1 propene 84 and 2,2 dimethoxypropane 85 in benzene with an acid catalyst such as p toluenesulfonic acid to give the bis ketal 94 which is suitably protected for subsequent conjugate addition reactions. Alternatively, the two hydroxyl moieties may be protected using 2 equivalents of 2 methoxypropene per equivalent of 92 in the presence of a catalyst such as chloroacetic acid to provide compounds such as 94A .Other useful protecting groups are dihydro 2H pyran, ethylvinylether and the like. Other acid sensitive protecting group for the two hydroxyl groups are the tri C1 to C4 alkylsilyls from silylchlorides , triphenylmethyl from tritylchloride or bromide , mono 2 methoxytriphenylmethyl from mono p methoxytriphenyl methylchloride or bromide , methoxymethyl from chloromethylmethylether and the like. Treatment of 88 with an oxalylhalide such as oxalylchloride or oxalylbromide is productive of the acid chloride 90 . FLOWSHEET KEMI47.1 Another preparation of the 4 hydroxycyclopentenone intermediates which contain a cis double bond in the potential a chain 109 is shown hereinbelow inFlowsheet L wherein g is as hereinabove defined. As illustrated in Flowsheet L there are three methods available to prepare the important intermediates 98 . The reaction of the o bromo carboxylic acid 95 with oxalyl chloride in an inert solvent such as benzene gives the acid chloride 96 . Addition of the acid chloride 96 in ether to an etheral solution of diazomethane 2 to 3 equivalents yields the diazoketone 97 which can be hydrolized in a two phase system consisting of ether and dilute sulfuricacid to the hydroxyketone 98 .Alternatively the acid chloride 96 can be treated with an excess of a 1,l,2 tris tri C1 to C4 alkylsilyloxyethylene, preferably l,1,2 tris trimethylsilyloxyethylene in the presence o a catalytic amount of stannic chloride in the absence of solvent to give compound 99 which can readily be hydrolized and decarboxylated to the desired hydroxyketone 98 using dilute hydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran. An alternate method to prepare 98 involves the reaction of the bromoolefin 100 with aqueous n bromosuccinimide NBS in the presence of a catalytic amount of acetic acid to give a mixture of bromohydrins with an oxidizing agent such as pyridinium chlorochromate in methylene chloride gives a mixture of bromoketone 103 and bromoaldehyde 104 . Refluxing this mixture with sodium formate in methanol then gives the desired intermediate 98 . Protection of the ketone function of 98 is accomplished using ethylene gycol in refluxing toluene with a catalytic amount of p toluenesulfonic acid. The ketal 103 is then reacted with dimethyl t butylsilylchloride and imidazole in dimethylformamide to give the fully protected compound 104 .The phosphonium salt 105 is obtained by refluxing a solution of 104 and triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile.Treatment of the phosphonium salt 105 with sodium methylsulfinylmethide in dimethylsulfoxide generates a phosphonium ylid which on reaction with aldehyde 106 gives 107 . Ref fluxing a water dioxane solution of 107 in the presence of a phosphate buffer pH 5 to 6 gives the cyclopentenone 108 . Treatment of 108 with chloral and triethylamine in ether gives 109 which on hydrolysis in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and dilute hydrochloric acid at 500 700C then gives the desired 4 hydroxycyclopentenone 110 which can be protected as described hereinabove in Flowsheet K. Treatment of 109 with trimethylsilylchloride and imidazole in DMF gives 111 which is also suitably protected for a conjugate addition reaction. FLOWSHEET LEMI50.1 FLOWSHEET L CONTINUEDEMI51.1 The preparation of the reagent 1,1,2 tris tri Cl to C4 alkylsilyloxyethylene is described below using, as the illustrative compound l,1,2 tris trimethyl silyloxyethylene 80 . The reaction of glycolic acid with 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexamethyldisilazane and trimethylsilylchloride in pyridine gives bis trimethylsilated glycolic acid 113 , see Flowsheet M. Addition of 113 to a tetrahydrofuran solution of one equivalent of lithium 1, 0 1,1,3,3,3 hexamethyldisilazane amide at 78 C generates a lithium enolate which is trapped with trimethylsilychloride to produce the desired reagent 80 . FLOWSHEET MEMI52.1 EMI52.2 The preparation of the prostaglandin congeners of this invention are described hereinbelow in FlowsheetN wherein Z is as hereinabove defined R3 is hydrogen, 2 methoxy propyl 2 oxy OC CH3 2OCH3 or trimethyl silyloxy R3 is hydrogen or hydroxy T is the radicalEMI52.3 wherein R is as hereinabove defined. R is selected from the group consisting of EMI53.1 EMI54.1 wherein R51 R6, R7 R81 Rg, R101 11 R131 A, p, q, t, s, m, n, Y, and X are as hereinabove defined. In accordance with Flowsheet N the vinyliodide 114 is treated with ether one equivalent of n butyllithium or 2 equivalents of t butyllithium at low tem erature, preferably 300 to 700 in an inert solvent, e.g., hexane, ether or toluene to provide the trans alkenyl lithium reagent ll6 . Alternatively, the vinyllithium reagent 116 can be prepared by treatment of a vinylstannyl derivative such as 115 with n butyllithium at 100 to 780C in ether or THF. For the preparation of the asymmetrical lithio cuprate 117 or the like, a solution of one molar equivalent of copper I l alkyne, preferably copper I lpentyne in anhydrous hexamethylphosphorous triamide preferably one to five molar equivalents, and anhydrous ether is added to one molar equivalent of the aforementioned vinyllithium solution cooled to about 780C.After about one hour at this temperature, a molar equivalent of the requisite cyclopentenone 120 is added.After several hours at 780C to 200C the reaction mixture is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride solution and the blocked product 121 is isolated in the usual manner. It is also possible to effect conjugate 1,4addition with the asymmetrical lithio cuprate 119 derived from vinyllithium 116 and cuprous thiophenoxide. oA solution of vinyllithium 116 in ether at 780C is reacted with an equimolar amount of a reagent prepared by admixture, in ether at a temperature of OOC to 78 0C, of equimolar amounts of cuprous thiophenoxide and copper I iodide tributylphosphonium complex. After about 30 minutes at this temperature, the lithio cuprate 119 is treated with the requisite cyclopentenone 120 as described hereinabove for the conjugate addition with 1alkynyl lithio cuprate 117 . For the preparation of the symmetrical lithio cuprate 118 one molar equivalent of copper I iodide tributylphosphine complex, dissolved in anhydrous ether, is added at about 78 C to two molar equivalents of the aforementioned vinyl lithium 116 solution in hexanes, cooled to 78 C. After about one hour at this temperature, the lithio cuprate 118 is treated with the requisite cyclopentenone 120 as described hereinabove for the conjugate addition with the l alkynyl lithio cuprate 117 . The procedures for conjugate addition involving organocopper reagents are well known in the art, see for example, C.J. Sih, et al., J.A.C.S., 97, 865 1975 . All available evidence leads us to believe that the cH CH R 12 function introduced by the cuprate process occupiesPa position trans to the ll oxy function.Similarly, we are led to the conclusion that in the product 121 the two side chains attached to C8 and C12 are trans to each other. However, we are not certain of this configurational relationship in the product as it is obtained directly from the cuprate process. These products may have the side chains in a trans or cis relationship or they may be a mixture containing both the transand cis isomers. This is indicated in the nomenclature of the ocmpounds involved by the designation 8 . In order to ensure a trans relationship in 121 these products can be submitted to conditions known in the literature to equilibrate the cis 8 iso PGEl to a mixture containing about 90 of the trans product. These conditions involve treatment with potassium acetate in aqueous methanol for 96 hours at room temperature. FLOWSHEET NEMI56.1 When T isEMI57.1 removal of the blocking groups from 121 to give the prostaglandin congener 122 is accomplished by treatment of 121 with a mixture of acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran and water 4 2 1 at 250 to 550C.When T isEMI57.2 121 can be partially deblocked to give ketal 123 by treatment of 121 with 0.6Nhydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature for 4 to 7 hours. The compounds of the present invention of formula I where G is C O CH2OH, C O CH2OR,EMI57.3 EMI57.4 or C O CH2SR16 are conveniently prepared by the iodine catalyzed oxidation of a 9a,11a dihydroxy1 ethylenedioxy l hydroxymethyl or alkoxymethyl 5 cis 13 trans prostadiene 151 or 152 in an inert organic solvent, at about 10 to about 20 is contacted with a solution of iodine, also in an inert organic solvent, for time sufficient to complete the epoxidation reaction, i.e.., from about 15 minutes to about 48 hours. The mole ratios of 151 iodine are in the range of 10 1 to 1 1, preferable 8 1 to 3 1. The reaction proceeds favorably in the presence of basic organic or inorganic catalysts, preferably sodium bicarbonate. Inert organic solvents useful in the above reaction include diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, and the like. The compounds of formula 1Sla are converted to the compounds of formula 151b by a reaction in acid media. The reaction is conveniently carriad.out in ann aqueous inert organic solvent solution, such as the or organic ether solvents illustrated previously, at temperatures and times familiar to those skilled in the art of hydrolysis of ketals, typically about room temperature to about 750 for about 1 hours to about 48 hours. As a further embodiment for the preparation of the compounds of formula I, in the cases of the compounds where G is C O OR, or C O OH, a l,4 dihydroxy 2 5 cis octenoate 3 C13C14 R2 substituted cyclopentane 152,Flowsheet S is epoxidized in an inert organic solvent at about 10 to about 200 for time sufficient to complete the epoxidation reaction, i.e., from 15 minutes to about 48 hours. The mole ratios of octenoate iodine, are in the range of 10 1 to about 1 1, preferably about 8 1 to about 3 1. Compounds 151e i can be hydrolyzed to remove the group R1 where such is C1 C6 alkyl giving the free carboxylic acid, compounds 15le ii. The hydrolysis reaction is preferably conducted in a pro tic solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the like using a strong base, for example, sodium hydroxide, at 10 to about 300 fro about from 15 minutes to about 48 hours. Conventional techniques suchas extractive or chromatographic techniques can be used to isolate the desired product. Alternately, compounds l5le ii can be prepared from an analogous l,4 dihydroxy 4 cis l heptenoic acid by first protecting the hydroxyl functionality at position 4 with a suitable protecting group such illustrated by the group tetrahydropyran 2 yl or trimethylsilyloxy.Protection of the hydroxyl functionality in the chain C13 C14 R2 must also be effected such preferably by tri tint on of such hydroxyl functionality. The starting compound in such cases is illustrated as seen in FlowsheetT by Intermediate compound C, 9a hydroxy 11u tetra hydropyranyloxy 16 tritlyloxy 17 methyl 5 cis,13 trans prostadienoic acid. The preparation of the precursors to the intermediates used in the preparation of the compounds of formula I is illustrated by FXowsheet U. In Reaction Step 1,2 8 hydroxy 7 ethylenedioxy 2 cis octenyla 4 hy droxycyclopent 2 en 1 one 151h is prepared by treatment of 2 8 hydroxy 7 oxo 2 cis octenyl 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 en 1 one 151g with ethylene glycol and Amberlyst resin, preferably Amberlyst 15 resin. This reaction, is set forth herein in the examples.The aforementioned ketal is then treated with chlorotrimethylsilane to effect reaction of the free hydroxy groups at the 4 position of the cyclopentene nucleus and at the 8 position of the octenyl ketal giving 1511 . Such reaction, forming th e trimethylsilyloxy substituent at these positions is well known to those skilled in the art as a fecting a protecting reaction of free hydroxyl groups, such being readily removed when desired at a later time. In Reaction Step 3, the 3 position of the cyclopentenolone nucleus is substituted with a desired hydrocarbon chain by a cuprate conjugate addition reaction as described herein above to give 151j after removal of the protecting groups as described hereinabove and in the examples to follow. The 2,3 cyclopentanolone of Reaction Step 3, 151j is then converted to the cyclopentane l,4 diol 151 by treatment of the product from Reaction Step 3 with lithium selectride at reduced temperature, thus forming 151 Intermediate A. This reaction path is known to those skilled in the art and is described in the preparations herein. The product of Reaction Step 3 may also be treated in a dehydrolysis reaction to remove the ketal group oncorporated in the side chain at the 2position of the cyclopentane nucleus. This reaction, shown as Reaction Step 5, in a manner to that described earlier for the preparation of compounds 151a , and is set forth with particularity in the examples herein. FLOWSHEET REMI60.1 FLOWSHEET SEMI61.1 FLOWSHEET TEMI62.1 FLOWSHEET UEMI63.1 When the compounds of this invention are prepared from raemic starting compounds two racemates are obtained.In appropriate instances these racemates are obtained.In appropriate instances these racemates can be separated from each other by careful application of the usual chromatographic procedures. In the more difficult instances it may be necessary to apply high pressure liquid chromatography including recycling techniques. See G.Fallick, American Laboratory, 19 27 August, 1973 as well as references cited therein. Additional information concerning high speed liquid chromatography and the instruments necessary for its application is available fromWaters Associate, Inc., Maple Street, Milford, Mass. It is also possible to prepare the compounds of this invention in their optically active forms by the conversion of the optically active 4 hydroxycyclopent 2en l one carboxylic acids 128 to the optically active protected hydroxy ketone analog 129 using the methods outlined hereinabove in Flowsheet K.EMI64.1 In accordance with the following reaction scheme prostanoids are prepared as described by Stork in J,A.C.S.. 97, 4 1975 and J.A.C.S. 97 6260 1975 . EMI65.1 Treatment of the protected 4 oxycyclopentenone A with a cuprate such as 117 , 118 or 119 as hereinabove defined, followed by quenching with formaldehyde to provide the hydroxymethyl analog B which is dehydrated with reagents such as excess methansulfonyl chloride in pyridine followed by treatment of the crude mesylate with diissopropylethylamine in ether overnight. R3 , R311 and R2 are as previously defined.Addition of the methylenecyclopentanone C to a solution of the Grignard MgtCH2 Rl wherein f is as previously defined and R1 is protected by a suitable blocking group such as 2 methoxypropyl 2 oxy, and a catalytic amount of Bu3P.CuI Bu3 is tertiary butyl followed by mild hydrolysis of the adduct provides the product prostanoid D wherein f, R andR2 are as previously defined. The bromide precursor to the Grignard described above is prepared in accordance with the procedure ofFlowsheet L. Conjugate addition of the vinyl cuprates to 129 followed by deblocking as described hereinabove inFlowsheet N then gives the compounds of this invention in their optically active forms. Although in some cases two diastereoisomerswil1 be formed, each optically active, they can be separated by chroma tographic procedures as described hereinabove. The preparation of optically active 4 hydroxy cyclopent 2 en 1 ones such as 120 is described hereinbelow. The 4 hydroxycyclopentenone racemates may be resolved into their component enantiomers 130 and 131 by derivatizing the keton function with a reagent having an optically active center. The resulting diastereomeric mixture can then be separated by fractional crystallization, or by chromatography, or by high speed liquid chromatography involving, if necessary, recycling techniques.Among the useful optically active ketone derivatizing reagents are l a aminoxy y methylpentanoic acid hydrochloride to give 132 3, R 2 aminoxy 3,3 dimethylbutyric acid hydrochloride, and 4 a methylbenzyl semicarbazide. After separation of the diastereomeric derivatives, reconstitu tin of the ketó function provides the individual 4 hydroxycyclopentenone enantiomers 130 and 131 . A useful procedure for the resulution of a 4 hydroxycyclopentenone racemate via an oxime such as 132 is described in the art R. Pappo, P. Collins and C. Jung, TetrahedronLetters, 943 1973 1. EMI66.1 An alternate procedure for the preparation.of the 4 R hydroxycyclopentenone enantiomers such as 130 involves as a key step the selective microbiological or chemical reduction of trione 133 to the 4 R hydroxycyclopentanedione 134 . A wide variety of microorganisms are capable of accomplsihing this asymmetric reduction, one of the most useful being Dipodascus unincleatus.This step also can be achieved chemically by catalytic hydrogenation in the usual manner for example, under about one atmosphere of hydrogen in methanol using a soluble rhodium catalyst with chiral phosphine ligands, such as 1, 5 cyclooctadiene bis o anisylcyclohexyl methylphosphinerhodium I tetrafluoroborate in the presence of one equivalent of organic base, such as tri ethyl amine. Conversion of hydroxycyclopentanedione 134 to an enol ether or enol ester, 135, Z alkyl, preferably iso propyl aroyl such as benzoyl or arylsulfonyl such as 2 mesitylenesulfonyl , is accomplsihed by treatment, for example, with isopropyl iodide and a base such as potassium carbonate in refluxing acetone for from 15 to 20 hours, or with a base such as triethylamine and 0.95 equivalents of benzoyl chloride or a slight excess of 2 mesitylenesulfonyl chloride, in a non prototropic solvent at a temperature of about 100 to 150C. Reduction of 135 with excess.sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum ydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or toluene at low temperatures, such as 600 to 780C, followed by mild acid hydrolysis representative conditions aqueous dilute hydrochloric acid, pH 2.5 or oxalic acid, sodium oxalate in chloroform at ambient temperatures from 1 to 3 hours provides the 4 R hydroxycyclopentenone ester 136 . The ester 136 , can then be hydrolyzed to acid 130 . For a description of these procedures in the art see C. J. Sih, et al, J.A.C.S., 95, 1676 1973 J. B. Heather, ret al., Tetrahedron Letters, 2213 1973 R. Pappo and P. W. Collins, Tetrahedron Letters, 2627 1972 ana R. Pappo, P. Collins, and C. Jung, Ann. N.Y.Acad. Sci. , 180, 64 1971 .EMI68.1 Procedures for the preparation of the requisite cyclopentanetriones 133 are well established in the art and generally involve the treatment of an 1oxo long chain ester 137 with methyl or ethyl oxalate and a base such as sodium methoxide in methanol, followed by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid in aqueous methanol to effect the dealkoxalylation of the intermediate 138 . See J. Kutsube and M. Matsui, Arg. Biol.Chem., 33 1078 1969 P. Collins, C. J. Jung and R.Pappo, Israel Journal of Chemistry, 6, 839 1968 R.Pappo, P. Collins and C. Jung, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 180, 64 1971 C. J. Sih, et al, J.A.C.S., 95, 1676 1973 see reference 7 and J. B. Heather, et al.,Tetrahedron Letters, 2313 973 for pertinent background literature. EMI69.1 The intermediate keto esters 137 may be prepared by a variety of methods known to the art. One useful procedure is outlined below and involves alkylation of ethyl acetoacetate sodium salt 139 in the usual manner with the appropriate side chain precursor 140,X C1, Br, I, preferably Br or I followed by decarbethoxylation and reesterification, all in the usual manner.EMI69.2 The side chain precursors 140 are commercially available where Z is CH2 p , and can be prepared as described in Belgian Patent 786,215 opened to inspectionJanuary 15, 1973 . It is also possible to resolve the 4 hydroxycyclopentenone racemate 143 by microbiological means.Thus, treatment of the 4 O alkanoyl or aroyl derivatives 144, R18 aryl or alkyl of racemate 143 preferably the 4 O acetyl and 4 O propionyl derivatives with an appropriate microorganism, preferably a Saccharbmyces species e.g., 1375 143, affords preferential de O acylation of the 4 R enantiomer to give 145 , which is then separated from the unreacted 4 S O acyl enantiomer 146 by chromatographic procedures. After separation, mild hydrolysis of the 4 S derivative 149 provides the 4 S hydroxycyclopentenone 147 . tsee N. J. Marsheck and M.Miyano, Biochima et Biphysica Acta, 316, 363 1973 for related examples. EMI70.1 It is also possible to prepare the individual 4 hydroxycyclopentenones 145 and 147 directly by selective microbial hydroxylations of the corresponding 4 unsubstituted cyclopentenone 148 . For example, with Aspergillus niger ATCC 9142 a selective 4 R hydroxylation of 148, Z CH2 6 has been reported see S. Kurozumi, T. Tora and S. Ishimoto, TetrahedronLetters, 4959 1973 . Other microorganisms can also accomplish this hydroxylation.EMI71.1 The 9a hydroxy PGF precursor compounds are prepared by a conjugate addition reaction as described hereinabove in Flowsheet N. The initial conjugate addition product 121 wherein Z, T , R3 and R are as hereinabove defined is not deblocked but dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. An excess of lithium perhydro 9b borophenalyhydride PBPH in tetrahydrofuran is added at 780C. After warming to 0 C., the reaction mixture is quenched with saturated ammonium chloride solution. The product is isolated and deblocked with acetic acid tetrahydroduran water 4 2 1 at 400C. in the cases where T isEMI71.2 and with dilute hydrochloric acid in the where T isEMI71.3 the precursor 9ahydroxy compounds.See Flowsheet P hereinbelow wherein Z, T , R3 are as hereinabove defined. FLOWSHEET PEMI72.1 The l hydroxymethyl group of the compounds of Formula Ia can be selectively esterified by dissolving the free hydroxy compounds in pyridine and adding one equivalent of an anhydride R15 CO 20 or the acid chloride R15C Cl and allowing the mixture to stand overnight to give the desired esters 153 .EMI72.2 R15 is phenyl substituted with one or more groups such as alkyl C1 C4 , OR, SR, F, C1, dialkylamino or C2 C4 alkyl, wherein R is C1 C4 alkyl. The E series compounds 122 may also be esterified by this procedure. The novel prostacyclin compounds of the present invention have potential utility as hypotensive agents, vasodilators, anti ulcer agents, agents for the treatment of gastric hypersecretion and gastric erosion, agents to provide protection against the ulcerogenic and other gastric difficulties associated with the use of various non steroidal anti inflammatory agents e.g., indomethacin, aspirin, and phenylbutazone , and bronchodilators. Members of the 16 aryloxy 17 20 tetranor and 17 aryl 18, 20 triner series are expected to have utility as abortifcients, agents for the induction of labor, agents for theiinduction of menses, fertility controlling agents, oestrus regulators for use in animal husbandry with cattle and other domestic animals. They also are useful as inhibitors of platelet aggregation and as agents to contain ischemia during myocardial infarction.Certain of the novel compounds of this invention possess utility as intermediates for the preparation of the other novel compounds of this invention. The novel compounds of this invention possess the pharmacological activity described below as associated with the appropriate above described prostaglandin types. The known PGE, PGFa, PGFB, PGA and PGD compounds are all potent in causing multiple biological responses even at low doses. For example, P GEl 1 PGE2, PGA1 and PGA2 are extremely potent in causing vasodepression and smooth muscle stimulation, and also are potent as antipolytic agents. Moreover, for many applications, these known prostaglandins have an inconveniently short duration of biological activity. In striking contrast, the prostacyclin analogs of this invention are substantially more specific with regard to potency in causing prosta glandin like biological responses, and or having a substantially longer duration of biological activity. For For example, the ll deoxy prostacyclin compounds of this invention are selective in that they are at most relatively weak stimulents of smooth muscle.A further advantage of these novel compounds lies in their increased stabilities and lengthened shelf lives. Each of these novel prostacyclin analogs of this invention is surprisingly and unexpectedly more useful than one of the corresponding known prostaglandins and prostacyclins for at least one of the pharmacological purposes indicated below, either because it has a different and narrower spectrum of biological activity than the known prostaglandins and therefore is more specific in its activity and causes smaller and fewer undesired side effects than the known prostaglandins, or because of its prolonged activity, fewer and smaller doses of the novel prostacyclin analog can frequently be used to attain the desired result. They also possess greater chemical stability than the natural prostacyclin, PGl2. Another advantage of the novel compounds of this invention compared with the known prostaglandins and prostacyclins, is that these novel compounds are administered effectively orally, topically, sublingually, intravaginally, bucally, or rectally, in addition to the usual intravenous, intramuscular, aerosol, or subcutaneous injection or infusion methods indicated for the uses of the known prostaglandins. Of particular interest is the topical vasodilator activity of the 16 hydroxy 16 vinyl derivatives of this invention. These qualities are advantageous because they facilitate maintaining uniform levels of these compounds in the body with fewer, shorter, or smaller doses, and make possible self administration by the patient. The novel prostacyclin of this invention are useful as bronchodilators for the treatment of asthma and chronic bronchitis. As such, they may be conveniently administered by inhalation of aerosol sprays prepared in a dose range of about 10 pg to about 10 mg ml of a pharma cologically suitable liquid vehicle. The prostacyclin compounds are also useful in mammals, including man and certain useful animals, elm., dogs and pigs to reduce and control excessive gastric secretion, thereby reducing or avoiding gastric erosion or gastrointestinal ulcer formation, and accelerating the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract.For this purpose, the compounds are injected or infused intravenously, subcutaneously, on intramuscularly in an infusion dose range of about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per Kg of body weight per minute, or in a total daily dose by injection or infusion in the range of about 0.1 to about 20 mg per Kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. These compounds may also be useful in conjunction with various nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, phenylbutazone, indomethacin and the like, to minimize the well known ulcerogenic effects of the latter. The prostacyclin compounds of this invention are also useful as topical vasodilators. The prostacycline compounds of this invention are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation, to reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and to remove or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals including man, rabbits, and rats. For example, these compounds are useful to treat and prevent myocardial infarcts and post operative thrombosis. For these purposes, these compounds are administered systemically, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and in the form of sterile implants for prolonged action. For rapid response, especially in emergency situations, the intravenous route of administration is preferred. Doses in the range of about 0.005 to about 20 mg per Kg of body weight per day are used, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and rou te of administration. It is well known that platelet aggregation inhibitors may be useful as anti thrombotic drugs. Inhi bition of platelet aggregation can be conveniently measured in vitro by monitoring changes in optical density and or light transmission in platelet rich plasma upon addition of suitable aggregating agents such as adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine, thrombin or collagen. Alternatively, platelet aggregation can be measured in vitro using platelet rich plasma obtained at various time intervals from animals given inhibitors by an oral or parenteral route. As noted earlier, the compounds of Formula I may possess a chiral center. Accordingly, the compounds of this invention may be prepared in either their optically form or as a racemic mixture. Unless otherwise specified, the compounds described herein are all in their racemic form. however, the scope of the subject invention is not to be considered limited to the racemic form, but to encompass the individual optical isomers of the compounds of the present invention. When desired, the individual diastereomeric and optically isomeric compounds can be isolated by conventional separation and purification procedures in the case or diastereo isomers and by conventional resolution procedures in the case of optical isomers. Optima physical, or physical chemica , separation procedures and resolution procedures in the case of optical isomers. Optima physical, or physical chemical, separation procedures and resolution procedures can be obtained, by routine trial and error procedures well within ghe scope of those skilled in the art. A further understanding of the invention can be had from the following non limiting preparations and examples. As used hereinabove and below, unless expressly stated to the contrary, all temperatures and temperatures ranges referred to the centigrade system and the terms ambient or room temperature refer to about 20 C. The term percent or t refers to weight percent and the term mole and moles refers to gram moles. The term equivalent refers to a quantity of reagent equal in moles to the moles of the preceding or succeeding reactant recited in that preparation or example, in terms of moles of finite weight or volume. As noted earlier, compounds having asymmetric centers and optical activity are isolated in their racemic corm unless otherwise indicated. Example 1 I.
