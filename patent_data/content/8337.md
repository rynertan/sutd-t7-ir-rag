# Apparatus for computed tomographic scanning.

## Abstract
An improved method for computed tomographic scan ning is disclosed. A beam of electromagnetic radiation sub tending an angle Ø is alternately translated and rotated past a patient. The intensity of the beam is detected by an array after the radiation passes the patient and a reconstructed image created from the detected intensities. Each rotation of the array is through an angle less than the angle Ø subtended by the array producing redundant intensity readings for similarly oriented beam paths through the patient. This redundant intensity data is modified according to a scheme which tends to reduce motion and misalignment artifacts within the patient.
