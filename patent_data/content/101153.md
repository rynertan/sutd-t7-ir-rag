# ALUMINIUM ELECTROLYTIC REDUCTION CELLS

## Abstract
In an electrolytic cell of the type in which a molten product metal such as Al is produced by electrolysis of a less dense fused electrolyte, there is provided a displacement block which can be raised or lowered in order to displace the fluid contents of the cell. This may be useful in order to reduce variations in the fused electrolyte surface level, or to tap metal from the cell. The block may be in the electrolysis compartment, in which case it may be an anode or a body of frozen electrolyte, or in a separate metal collection chamber which may be separated from the electrolysis compartment by a metal selective filter.
