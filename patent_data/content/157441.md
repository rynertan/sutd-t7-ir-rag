## Description
The invention relates to recombinant plasmids, bacteria containing such recombinant plasmids and processes for preparing food products, animal feedstuffs or ingredients thereof or proteins such as enzymes using such bacteria. More specifically, the invention relates to recombinant plasmids capable of replicating in Most recombinant DNA work has been carried out with bacteria such as High quality starter cultures of lactic streptococci used in the dairy industry for the production of cheese, yoghurt and the like have to be controlled carefully for their strain characteristics such as acid production, proteolytic activity, phage resistance and flavour formation, since it can easily occur that mutants are formed or they become infected, whereby the quality of the starter cultures is destroyed see reference 1 . Some thoughts on what might be done to improve lactic acid cultures by means of recombinant DNA technology were published by Wouters and Stadhouders see reference 2 , but these authors do not give practical solutions. Thus a need exists for recombinant plasmids which can express proteins in lactic acid bacteria, so that these transformed lactic acid bacteria have improved or new properties which are desirable in the food industries. The present invention provides recombinant plasmids capable of replication in Preferably such plasmids contain at least part of the Another aspect of the invention is a transformed lactic acid bacterium, preferably belonging to the genus Finally the invention relates to a transformed The specification contains the following drawings which help to explain the invention. In Fig. 1 the restriction enzyme maps of plasmids pGK1, pGK11 and pGK12 are given as well as their preparation from plasmids pWV01, pGL112 which is a chimera of plasmids pC194 and pUB110 and pE194 In Figure 2 linear restriction enzyme maps of plasmids pGKV1 and pGKV2 are given and important genes and their orientation are indicated, as well as their preparation from pPL608 and pGK3 and the preparation of pGK3 from pWV01 and pE194 In Figure 3 a linear restriction enzyme map of plasmid pWV05 is given for In Figure 4 linear restriction enzyme maps of plasmids pGKV2 and pGKV500 are given and the origin of the fragments of the plasmids. In Figure 5 crossed and tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis of cell free extracts of In Figure 6 crossed immunoelectrophoresis of cell free extracts of In Figure 7 the construction of pGKV41 from pGKV2 and M13 mp11 is given, as well as a modified Multiple Cloning Site MCS derived from M13 mp11 and the linear restriction enzyme map of pGKV41. This plasmid has an MCS between the SPO2 promoter from In Figure 8 the construction of pGKU1 is given. This is a derivative of pGKV41 also containing a chemically synthesized Ribosome Binding Site RBS , a chemically synthesized alpha amylase signal sequence and the methionyl prochymosin gene derived from pMS 48. In Figure 9 the results of growth of In Figure 10 the effect of pGKV500 on Lane In the case of cell lysates, an amount corresponding to ca. 10⁸ cells was loaded per lane. For the analysis of supernatants, an amount corresponding to 4 ml supernatant of a culture with 10⁹ cfu ml was loaded per lane. The mix in lane 4 was introduced to exclude misinterpretation due to differences in electrophoretic behaviour of the various samples. As mentioned above, a need exists for recombinant plasmids which can express proteins in lactic acid bacteria so that these transformed lactic acid bacteria have improved or new properties which are desirable in the food industries. The present invention now provides recombinant plasmids containing genes which can be expressed not only in Thus a first aspect of the invention is a recombinant plasmid capable of replication in Preferably the recombinant plasmid according to the invention contains at least two markers capable of expression in the three types of microorganisms referred to. It is further preferred that at least one marker is capable of being inactivated by the insertion of insert DNA, having the advantage that the piece of insert DNA can be inserted in the marker. Very suitable markers appeared to be the chloramphenical resistance Cm It was known that the Cm As a starting material for the preparation of the above described expression plasmids a recombinant vector plasmid can be used that is also capable of replication in An example of the first generation of vector plasmids, i.e. those containing one marker, is one designated as pGK1, which was prepared by inserting a This plasmid was then converted into a smaller plasmid, designated as pGK11, by treatment with An example of the second generation of vector plasmids containing selection markers was made by incorporation of the Em The The Although these antibiotic resistant markers appeared very helpful in cloning foreign genes into lactic acid bacteria, it is preferred to inactivate or even delete these markers and to use autotrophic markers, which are advantageous for microorganisms used in the food industry. Moreover, they can give advantages to the host cell in the fermentation process. Examples of such an auxotrophic marker are the genes for lactose metabolism see reference 8 , which can be integrated in the Another example of the first generation of vector plasmids is one designated as pGK3, which was made by treating the This pGK3 was converted to a plasmid of the second generation by pGKV1 and pGKV2 both contain a unique Plasmid pGKV2 was used to prepare a recombinant plasmid containing a structural gene coding for a protease, which plasmid was designated as pGKV500. It was made by inserting the 4.3 Md As a consequence of the insertion in the When recombinant plasmids are made which express the structural genes in lactic acid bacteria, it is desirable for practical application to remove at least one marker, provided that the plasmids are stable enough to replicate without a selection pressure, in order to make the transformed microorganisms again sensitive to antibiotics. If an auxotrophic marker is present in the recombinant plasmids according to the invention, they can give to the bacteria in which these plasmids are expressed an advantage over other bacteria, in that the transformed bacteria can use the ingredients of the fermentation medium more efficiently and therefore can grow better. Another embodiment of the invention relates to A preferred lactic acid bacterium is one provided with a more stable and or higher protease activity as a result of the insert DNA in the plasmid coding for the protease. Another preferred lactic acid bacterium is one having a reduced bacteriophage sensitivity as a result of the insert DNA in the plasmid containing one or more genes for bacteriophage resistance. Still another preference relates to a lactic acid bacterium capable of producing a milk clotting enzyme or a precursor thereof, which precursor forms the enzyme during fermentation of a milk product, more particularly one which is capable of producing chymosin or one of its precursors, such as methionyl pseudochymosin, methionyl prochymosin and preprochymosin, as a result of the insert DNA in the plasmid coding for the chymosin or its precursors. Preferably, the lactic acid bacteria according to the invention belong to the genus A further embodiment of the invention relates to a process for preparing a fermented food product, animal feedstuff or ingredient thereof, in which process a lactic acid bacterium according to the invention is used, as well as to the products so obtained. Another embodiment relates to a process for preparing a protein, in which process a lactic acid bacterium according to the invention is used, as well as to the protein so obtained. The invention will be illustrated by the following six Examples without being limited thereto. In Example 1 the construction of recombinant vector plasmids pGK1, pGK2 and pGK12 is described. They contain one pGK1 and pGK11 or two pGK12 markers beside the replication origin of In Example 2, the construction of recombinant vector plasmids with one pGK3 and two pGKV1 and pGKV2 markers beside the replication origin of pWV01 is described. Further, the expression of two heterologous genes for Em In Example 3, the cloning and expression of genes coding for In Example 4, the cloning and expression of a gene coding for prochymosin in In Example 5, growth and acid production of In Example 6, a procedure is described to detect and isolate other protease genes by hybridization with the 5.0 Md Thus, Examples 1 5 describe both recombinant vector plasmids pGK1, pGK3, pGK11, pGK12, pGD4, pGD6, pGKV1, pGKV2, pGKV20, pGKV210, pGKV21, pGKV41 and recombinant plasmids containing an insert DNA which can give improved or new properties to lactic acid bacteria pGKV500 for protease activity and pGKU1 for milk clotting activity . The details of the isolation of the protease s genes s of pWV05 and their expression in general, given in Examples 3 and 5, are not claimed in this application, but were intended to form the subject of another patent application claiming the convention priority from this or a similar patent application as filed under the European Patent Convention on 4 March 1985. The details of the combination of These two intended other applications have not been filed. However, Examples 3 and 5, relating to the expression of the protease gene s in Example 6 describes the use of the 5.0 Md The strains used are described in Table A. For preparing plasmid DNA Plasmids pE194 Restriction enzymes were used as specified by the manufacturer. Digested DNA was analyzed in 1 horizontal agarose Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, California gels in TBE buffer 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 µg of ethidium bromide per ml pH 8.0 . Bacteriophage SPP1 DNA digested with Vector molecules were mixed with the restriction fragments to be inserted at a ratio of approximately 1 2 at a concentration of 100 µg ml in TE buffer 10 mM Tris hydrochloride, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4 . After heating for 5 min at 68 C, the samples were adjusted to ligase buffer 10 mM Tris hydrochloride, 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 50 mM NaCl pH 7.4 . T4 DNA ligase was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 7 C. After fivefold dilution with ligase buffer, incubation was continued for about 18 h at 7 C. Ligated DNA preparations were used to transform protoplasts of The physical maps of pGL112, pE194 In order to examine the usefulness of the The fact that the Cm The transformation efficiency of pGK12 from both sources in transformations of To examine whether the markers carried by the pWV01 derived vectors can be expressed in lactic acid streptococci, pGK12 isolated from The copy number of pGK12 in the three hosts was determined see Table C . In both Table D shows that pGK12 was stably maintained in Various methods used in this example are given in all detail either in example 1 or example 3. Plasmid pGK3 was treated with restriction enzyme The The largest The This Subsequently, protoplasts of Two types of transformants were obtained, one carrying plasmid pGKV1 and the other carrying plasmid pGKV2 a restriction map of both plasmids is shown in Fig. 2 . The difference between pGKV1 and pGKV2 concerns the orientation of the CAT gene towards the SPO2 promoter. These vectors were used to transform protoplasts of The fact that the transformed The strains and plasmids used are described in Table E. B. Plasmids from Total plasmid from Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, F.R.G. and used according to the supplier s instructions. Digested DNA preparations were electrophoresed in horizontal agarose gels 0.5 to 1 in TBE buffer 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 µg ml ethidium bromide pH 8.0 . Restriction enzyme fragments of pWV05 were shot gun cloned in pBR329 or in pACYCl84 using KI purified pWV05. Alternatively, specific fragments were purified from a digest of total Gel electrophoresis of the total plasmid DNA of pGKV2 Fig. 2 contains a unique pWV01 derived vectors transform From one of these In A to D Fig. 5 1 µl of the In A and B of Figure 6, 15 µl of the The CIE pattern of B Fig. 5 shows the two major precipitation lines of the With the The complete fusion of In order to construct a versatile cloning vector, the multiple cloning site MCS of M13mp11 see reference 38 was inserted in between the SPO2 promoter and the CAT gene of plasmid pGKV2 Fig. 7 . Therefore, this plasmid was treated with the restriction enzyme Subsequently the SPO2 promoter was placed again in front of the CAT gene. The smallest pMS48 was treated with the restriction enzyme A similar construction as has been outlined above can be carried out with the Overnight cultures grown in glucose M17 broth were washed in sterile distilled water and diluted 100 fold in skim milk 10 wt vol containing 0.5 glucose. Samples were taken at 1 h intervals during incubation at 30 C. Colony forming units were determined by plating on glucose M17 agar and acidity was determined by neutralization with 0.1 N NaOH. Lactic streptococci are nutritionally fastidious and require an exogenous supply of many amino acids. The concentration of free amino acids and small peptides in milk limits growth and concomitant acid production. For optimal growth, lactic streptococci are dependent on their proteinases which hydrolyze milk protein. Media developed to differentiate between proteinase positive and proteinase negative variants rely on their difference in growth and acid production in milk. To investigate whether the On GMAB medium, Growth and acid production in milk of This example proved that host cells transformed with plasmids containing genes for metabolic functions can grow better or are more active than the plasmid free cells. Lactose is the normal carbon source of lactic acid bacteria and therefore it is attractive to use one or several genes of the lactose metabolism as marker on plasmids. It may be expected that integration of the large On the basis of the pH and temperature optima of their proteinases proteases , The next step will be to make a restriction enzyme digest of the 9 Md plasmid to determine the fragment s on which the proteinase gene s of In this example only the most relevant parts are described, that were present in the draft publication forming part of the specification as filed and subsequently published as EP A1 0157441.
