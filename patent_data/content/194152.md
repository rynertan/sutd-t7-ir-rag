## Description
The present invention in general concerns a process for the carrying out of the soldering of manufactured articles by means of suitable soldering materials, wherever there is a requirement for application of heat with a gradual and controlled increase of the temperature. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for the soldering of electronic components on a support, by means of such soldering materials. Various methods are presently in use for soldering electronic components on suitable supports. One of these methods concerns mainly the soldering of devices components mounted on the support with their connections passing through metallized holes piercing the support itself. According to this method, the lower part of the support, opposite to that on which the components are mounted, is wetted by a wave of molten metal, in general a tin lead alloy, which penetrates the metallized holes of the support and coats a metallized area around the connection of the device. When the supporting plate is withdrawn from the metal wave, the metal deposited on the support, while cooling down, solidifies and thus connects the components with the support. This method, known as WAVE SOLDERING , displays, however, some well known drawbacks described for example in the article entitled Technique for soldering surface mounted devices SMD to Printed Circuit Boards PCB by C.J. Brierley et al., which appeared in In the case of components mounted on the surface SMD a second system may be used, which consists in mounting the SMD on the support in the desired position on suitable metallized traces obtained by putting on the support a suitable soldering cream. The assembly is then heated up by conduction, convention, or radiation, or a combination of the three ways, by means of a suitable system, for instance by means of hot air, infrared rays, or the saturated vapour of an inert substance, so as to reflow the soldering cream which, successively cooling down, will ensure the mechanical electrical connection between the components and the support. The system which uses the saturated vapour is presently known as one of the most effective for the soldering of SMD by solder reflow and it consists in immersing the assembly in a saturated vapour of an inert fluid, usually perfluoro carbides. In this case use is made of the latent heat of the vapours which condense on the assembly, reflowing the soldering material vapour phase soldering VPS . This method is described in a number of articles and patents, amongst which may, for instance, be cited GB A 2,139,132 and US A 3,866,307. However, VPS shows certain drawbacks, amongst which the most important is the fact that the operational temperature is one sole temperature, since it is fixed by the boiling temperature of the fluid. This limits the choice of the soldering alloys to those whose liquidus is below the boiling temperature of the fluid. Also known in the art, see for example Solder fusing with heated fluids by D. Schoenthaler in The main drawback in the use of fluorinated oxypropylenes lies in the alteration of the angle of contact following their prolonged use, with the consequential worsening of soldering. Polychlorotrifluoroethylenes, following prolonged use, generate hydrolytically unstable compounds and yield liquid cleavage products with a lower molecular weight and with too low viscosity and boiling point. Moreover, the polychlorotrifluoroethylenes used in the cited technique must necessarily possess boiling points well above the melt points of the soldering alloys in order to avoid losses due to evaporation, besides the losses due to compensation. This means that one should use polychlorotrifluoroethylenes with a relatively high molecular weight, which consequently, although having a low vapour pressure, have a high viscosity. This means that the pieces coming out of the bath would remove, by drag out, exaggerately high quantities of fluid. As far as the other fluids are concerned, these are in their totality inflammable or insufficiently stable under conditions of use, that is, in contact with the air. So much so, that sometimes vegetable oil is placed over a bath of molten metal, because in this way the oil, reacting with the atmospheric oxygen, will protect the underlying metal from oxidation. As is well known, in fact, soldering shows better properties when the metal does not come into contact with oxygen. We have now found a soldering method that overcomes all the afore mentioned drawbacks. Accordingly, the invention provides a process for soldering electronic components to a support, the process comprising arranging the components on the support together with a soldering material, and then placing the thus obtained assembly in contact with a perfluoropolyether which is in the liquid state and which has a temperature equal to or greater than the temperature at which the soldering material develops its binding properties. The components may be mounted on the support in any required position, whether on the surface, also on both faces of the support, or through metallized holes made in the support itself, where they may be kept in position by the soldering material e.g. a cream or paste endowed with binding properties, deposited on the surface or previously inserted into the metallized holes of the support. The binding properties of the soldering material are subsequently developed by the heating obtained by the contact of one or both surfaces of the support with the perfluoropolyether in the liquid state. Perfluoropolyethers are products well known in the art. Their preparation will be found described in numerous patents, such as for example in GB A 1104482, 1153306, 1189337, and 1217871, in US A 3242218, 3665041, and 3715378, and in Italian Patent Application 19496 A 85. There may be used, in the soldering process of the invention, perfluoropolyethers with kinematic viscosity values, at a temperature of 20 C, comprised between 10 and 2000 cSt, and which, moreover, are non boiling at atmospheric pressure and show a loss by evaporation of less than 1 by weight at a temperature of 150 C measured according to ASTM D 976 56 standards . The suitability of the perfluoropolyethers for soldering in liquid phase proves to be surprising also for the fact that such compounds are permeable to oxygen, wherefore it would be feared that there would be a tendency towards oxidation of the molten metal, just as described previously. Preferred perfluoropolyethers for the soldering process of the invention are those of the general structure Other suitable perfluoropolyethers are, in particular, those belonging to the following classes II C₃F₇O C₃F₆O The temperatures at which the process according to the present invention is conducted must be at least equal to the temperature at which soldering materials present on the support develop their binding properties through heating. As soldering materials there may be used all those used in the soldering processes, and consisting of a soldering metal or alloy or of a soldering metal or alloy incorporated in suitable fluxes, de oxidizers, and various additives, inclusive of solvents such as isopropanol. Examples of such metals and alloys are tin tin lead alloys for instance those with ratios Sn Pb 63 37 60 40 50 50 tin silver alloys e.g. with ratios Sn Ag 96.5 3.5 95 5 tin antimony alloys 95 5, 99 1 tin lead silver alloys 62 36 2 cadmium tin alloys etc. generally with liquidus temperatures between 180 C and 250 C. The binding action of such soldering materials develops through the melting and successive cooling down of the material. Fluxes have, as is well known to those skilled in the art, two specific functions. The first is that of removing the oxidized film coating the metal soldering materials. The second function is that of helping heat transfer during the soldering operation. As fluxes there are used in general weak acids, such as for example rosin colophony and other resinous acids, or organic salts such as methylammonium chloride. Likewise there may be used soldering materials of a non metallic type, electrically conductive, provided they are capable of exerting a binding action through the heating and cooling cycle. Examples of such materials are represented by epoxy and acrylic resins capable of exerting the binding action through vulcanization. The support for the electronic components may be constituted by different materials such as for instance glass fibres impregnated with epoxy or phenolic resins plastics laminates based on epoxy or phenolic resins ceramic materials consisting of sintered alumina powders or metallic materials or plastic materials in general. The process of this invention may be applied independently from the method of tracing the electrical connections among the various different components which are to be connected, and independently from the method by which the soldering material is applied. Preferably, the electronic components are mounted onto the surface of the support on metallized traces made of soldering materials e.g. creams or of other pre deposited conductive materials, or are inserted either through metallized holes filled with soldering cream or through holes into which preformed soldering pastes have been inserted. The contact between the support and the liquid perfluoropolyether, according to the process of the present invention, may be achieved in various different ways. Amongst these, just for exemplifying purposes, there may be cited In the cases of contact of the support with a wave of liquid, the wave may be generated with the same methods already used for producing waves of molten metal in the known WAVE SOLDERING processes. In this connection, reference is made to the book According to a variant that may be applied to the contact realized by means of a wave or dragging displacement as indicated herein above, the liquid perfluoropolyether may be placed as a layer, of a greater or lesser thickness, over a conventional soldering bath consisting of molten metal. In that case it will be possible to immerse the support in such a way that its lower face is in contact with the molten metal while its upper face is immersed in the overlying perfluoropolyether layer. It will thus be possible to obtain the soldering of the electronic components arranged under the support, by deposition of molten metal, while the soldering of the components arranged on top of the support will be obtained by the binding action of the soldering material that will be promoted by the contact with the perfluoropolyether, heated by the molten metal and vice versa . In this way the advantages of the two methods are combined, besides which one achieves protection of the metal bath from oxidation. A practical way for realizing the process according to the present invention may include the following operations in the given order Possibly the assembly may be subjected to washing with a solvent mixable with the liquid, for example l l 2 trichloro trifluoroethane or its azeotropes. The solvent and the liquid may then be recovered by distillation and be recycled into the system in their respective locations. In the particular case in which the components are mounted on the surface of both faces of the support, in order to better ensure the fixing of the components during the soldering phase, before step 3 there may be carried out an additional operation which consists in wrapping the assembly in a suitable film or covering of thermo shrinkable material, for instance made of a synthetic polymer. In such a case, the shrinkage of the film on the assembly will ensure the keeping in position of the components. The operation may be facilitated by operating under conditions of a slight vacuum, for example of 10 Torr. Instead of a thermo shrinkable film there may be used, for the same purpose, a permeable material, for instance of a textile fibre. In such a case, this operation of wrapping the assembly, may conveniently be carried out after step l of the process. The thermo shrinkable material is preferably chosen amongst those having a shrinking temperature of between l50 C and l80 C, so as to carry out the shrinkage operation on the film simultaneously with the pre heating of the assembly. If the shrinkage temperature is lower, a suitable heating system, for example by hot air, will allow one to carry out the thermo shrinking operation before step 3 . When one adopts this technique, the piece coming from step 3 will be washed by a jet of liquid as described under step 4 . Thereupon there will be carried out the removal of the film from the assembly, which in its turn will be cleaned according to the usual techniques employed for the removal of possible fluxes. The following examples are given to further illustrate this invention, but without any intention of limiting in any way the scope of the invention itself. On each of four ceramic material supports provided with a palladium silver metallization, achieved by screen printing using a soldering cream comprising 62 Sn 36 Pb 2 Ag, there was mounted a component a chip carrier having 20 connection pins. Each assembly was degassed in air by heating up for l5 minutes at l00 C. The process was then operated in the following way In all these cases the soldering was observed to be good. In one case only, during operation a , the chip carrier had shifted from its position. This indicated that preventive degassing of the assemblies would be especially desirable in the case of immersion. In order to keep the components better in position, a series of assemblies of the type described in Example l, with components mounted on both faces, were coated with a film of polyethylene, high resistance nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate P.E.T. , respectively. The films were applied under a light vacuum, and were then heat shrunk in hot air. The assemblies were then immersed in a GALDEN LP bath, having a thermostatically controlled temperature of between 220 and 240 C. The soldering times for the assemblies were only slightly greater than those measured in Example l a . This shows that all these systems do not hinder in any significant way the heat transfer rate from the perfluoropolyether to the assembly. The polyethylene film decomposed at melt temperature, though maintaining its integrity for a sufficient time to keep the component firmly in position on the support. A programme similar to that illustrated in Example l was carried out on supports of glass fibre impregnated with epoxy resin of the commercial type, mounting components on its surface and in holes passing through the support, respectively four dual in line packaged IC components and various discrete components. The devices had been fixed in place with a soldering cream comprising 62 Sn 36 Pb 2Ag. Thereupon degassing was carried out at l00 C for l0 to l5 seconds. The process then proceeded in the following way For comparative purposes, analogous assemblies were kept immersed, at a temperature of 232 C, in saturated vapour of GALDEN LS 230 a perfluoropolyether comprised in formula I , of a molecular weight of about 800, produced by MONTEFLUOS S.p.A. . The time necessary to obtain melting of the soldering creams proved to amount to 45 seconds. In all the above cases a , b , and c , the soldering was judged good and no drawbacks of displacements of the components on the support were observed. The heat transfer times from the fluid to the assembly proved, moreover, shorter than those necessary when soldering in vapour phase. A series of tests analogous to those of Example l was carried out using a support mounting conventional components fixed in holes passing through the support itself. Into the metallized holes of the support was applied a soldering paste comprising 62 Sn 36 Pb 2Ag. The temperature of the GALDEN LP bath was 230 C. The assemblies were kept immersed in the fluid for l8 s. The quality of the soldered joints was judged to be good. In all of Examples l to 4, cleaning of the assemblies after soldering was carried out with a washing system, commercially available on the market, which adopts an ultrasonic bath and l l 2 trichloro trifluoroethane. The assemblies were cleaned in all the cases of Examples l to 4, for l minute. In no cases was there visual evidence of residues of perfluoropolyether on the assemblies. After cleaning, the polluted l l 2 trichloro trifluoroethane solvent remaining in the washing apparatus was recovered by separating it by distillation from the perfluoropolyether. At the end of the tests mentioned in Examples l to 4, the perfluoropolyether remaining in the soldering apparatus, as well as that recovered by distillation from the cleaning solvent, was suitably filtered in order to remove residual particles, various impurities, and gases dissolved therein. The liquid thus obtained did not show, under analysis, any alterations whatsoever of its chemical physical characteristics.
