# Permanent magnet rotary electrical machines.

## Abstract
Permanent magnet rotors 12, 13 are rotatable within respective stator windings 14, 15 connected in series. A drive shaft 20 is coupled directly to the rotor 12 and is coupled to the rotor 13 through an epicyclic gear train 21 having a first input gear element 22 secured to the shaft 20 , an output gear element 24 secured to the rotor 13 and a second input element in the form of a carrier 28 for an intermediate gear 23 , the carrier 28 being angularly movable about the shaft 20 by an actuator 30 which is responsive to a difference between desired and sensed values of an output voltage.
