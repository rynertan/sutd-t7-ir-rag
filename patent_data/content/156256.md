# Reagent test device.

## Abstract
The substrate of conventional reagent test devices is replaced by polyester screen material having a nominal filter rating of from about 80 to about 130 microns such that liquid present in the reagent matrix material of the test device is retained therein and prevented from running over onto other reagent matrix areas present on the same reagent test device.
