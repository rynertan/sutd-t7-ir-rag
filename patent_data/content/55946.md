# Blood containing rind product and process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A blood containing rind product is described. The pro duct is a dehydrated haemoglobin containing pork rind product having a moisture content of less than 15 and a haemoglobin content of up to 50 by weight, which product is substantially colour stable when subsequently thermopro cessed, this being a great advantage from the point of view of the consumer. The product preferably contains less than 25 fat and preferably has a particle size less than 5 mm although larger comminutable particles are possible. The invention also includes a process for the preparation of the product by rehydrating a previously dehydrated pork ring product in a blood containing liquid, followed by a dehydration step, preferably at above 70 C and preferably under a vacuum. Additional fats may be included. The product may be blended with foodstuffs and is substantially colour stable when done so and subsequently thermoprocessed. Foodstuffs containing the product of the invention in both dehydrated and rehydrated forms are also disclosed.
