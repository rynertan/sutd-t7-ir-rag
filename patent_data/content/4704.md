# Connector for coupling together conductors of electrical components.

## Abstract
A connector for coupling together conductors 22, 26 of two or more electrical components 24, 28 , including a pair of jaw portions 36, 37 , a pair of lever portions 30, 31 respectively connected to and extending away from said jaw portions to form a fulcrum 33 such that squeezing together of the lever portions brings about an opening of the jaw portions, and biasing means 44, 48, 50 arranged to urge together said jaw portions. For increased clamping pressure, the biasing means includes resiliently deformable connecting means 48, 50 connecting together the free ends of the lever portions, and a resiliently deformable link member 44 connecting the junction of said connecting means to a point on the connector near the fulcrum. Upon the squeezing together of the lever portions the connecting means and link member are deformed but tend to resume their original shape upon release of the lever portion to provide constant clamping pressure on the conductors placed between the jaw portions.
