# Electric type speed meter.

## Abstract
An electric type speed meter comprising a pulse gener ating means 1 arranged to generate a pulse signal corres ponding to a vehicle speed, a control circuit 2 arranged to count the number of output pulses of the pulse generating means 1 at each time at regular time intervals and discriminate between positive and negative of a difference between a number value counted at the present time and a number value counted just before the present counting time and in addition generate pulses of the number correspond ing to that difference, a pulse motor driving circuit 3 arranged to distribute in sequence the output pulses of the control circuit to plural poles of a pulse motor 4 so as to rotate the pulse motor in either a regular direction or the reverse direction, and an indicator 5 arranged to be rotated at its pointer by the pulse motor 4 for indicating a speed.
