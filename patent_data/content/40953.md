# Optical scanning apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical scanning system 100 in which a col limated light beam 118, 120 , e.g. a laser beam, is swept periodically across a target surface, e.g. a rotating photo conducting drum 132 , includes beam synchronization feedback 140, 142, 144, 146, 150, 152 . A portion 118 of the light beam is split off and swept across an array of apertures held in place by a fibre optic assembly 140 . The light entering the fibre optic apertures is transmitted to one or more photodetectors 146 which generate corresponding electrical signals thereby to sample the tangential velocity of the sweeping beam 118, 120 , which are applied to a variable frequency oscillator 150 whose output synchronizes modulation of the beam. The described variable frequency oscillator is a phase locked loop connected to the photodetectors 146 , and includes a fast synchronization circuit which pro vides immediate synchronization between the character clock signal and the first electrical signal of each new sweep. In addition, a hold circuit is provided which holds the frequency of the character clock signal, coming from the phase locked loop constant during the dead time between beam sweeps.
