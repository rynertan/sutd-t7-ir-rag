# Cassette retaining device of electron beam apparatus.

## Abstract
A cassette retaining device comprises a pair of retaining mechanisms 14 disposed respectively on both sides of the top surface of a sample table 11 and pressing respectively on both sides of the top surface of a cassette 12 to hold the cassette in said predetermined position between the retaining mechanisms 14 and the sample table 11 . Each retaining mechanism 14 includes a presser 19 capable of moving between a first position where the presser 19 presses on a side portion of the top surface of the cassette 12 to hold the cassette and a second position where the presser 19 is sepa rated from the top surface of the sample table 11 to allow the cassette to be inserted or removed from between the presser and the sample table, a rocking arm 16 rockable around a pin 15a relatively to the sample table and bearing the presser 19 so that the presser may rock around a pin 19a parallel to the pin 15a , and spring urging the rocking arm 16 to rock in one direction, thereby locating the presser 19 in the first position.
