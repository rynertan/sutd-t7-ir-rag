# Method of fixed length binary encoding and apparatus for same.

## Abstract
A novel method of adapting Fibonacci number weight ing to raw binary code data of variable length to use the code as a fixed length code by using only those code sequences with a fixed number of cells rather than a fixed number of bits, converting the code to a continuous numerical sequ ence useful particularly for linear media and data transmis sion.
