# Room temperature curable polyorganosiloxane composition containing spindle shaped calcium carbonate.

## Abstract
A room temperature vulcanizable silicone rubber com position is prepared by mixing hydroxyl or alkoxyl endblock ed polydiorganosiloxane, crosslinking agent containing at least two water hydrolyzable radicals, namely alkoxy, ketox imo, alkenyloxy, aminoxy, amino, and amido, and characte rized in that it contains a spindle shaped calcium carbonate. Curing the composition results in a silicone rubber with improved thermal stability.
