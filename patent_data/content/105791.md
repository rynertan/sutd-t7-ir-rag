# Programmable video test pattern generator for display systems.

## Abstract
A front for test patterns is made programmable by programming individual characters to be displayed on a video display. The individual characters are assigned mem ory locations and can be adjusted in height and width, as well as in color and intensity. Complex characters are formed by programming additional features onto a character mem ory space assigned to each character. The system provides a greater ratio of pattern generat ing capability to required hardware, while providing most features of a fixed character generator. The system s prog rammability is particularly adapted to use with a test system which has capabilities of incrementally varying scan rate and raster patterns, as well as a capability of random stroke and a fixed mode stimuli generation.
