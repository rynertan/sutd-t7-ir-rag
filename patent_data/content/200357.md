## Description
The subject invention relates to a device for gener ating mechanical vibrations. More particularly, it relates to an electromagnetic vibration device utilizing non linear sectionalized waveform plate springs. Utilization of the principle of electromagnetic shock excitation for designing drivers has been used in the past in many forms of vibrating devices. Thus far, however, the application of vibrating machines is still limited and their energy saving effects and various other potential advantages have not been fully demonstrated nor made prac tical in wide application. Prior efforts in this field have largely laid emphasis on structural forms and mass combinations, and two crucial problem areas have not been seriously considered and ad dressed, namely 1 the design, manufacture, and parameter selection for the vibration component, and 2 the control of mechanical vibration. Mechanical vibration is a complex physical phenome non. Its amplitude, frequency, energy dissipation, and limits of stored and released energy depend on numerous factors including a rigidity characteristics of the vibration component, b structural damping of the vibration component, c magnitude, frequency, and other characteris tics of a shock exciting force, d magnitude and type of external damping, and e expected variations and changes in load. If the vibration component is a linear spring with constant rigidity , damping is directly proportional to velocity and a linear vibration system is formed. When such a system is applied to vibration machines, the disad vantages are that the limit of stored energy is relatively small and the stability of vibration is rather poor. For this reason, efforts have been made in the field toward non linear vibration devices many of which are available today. Non linear vibration systems of the prior art, how ever, have also been less than satisfactory. Certain non linear springs may stabilize a systems inherent frequency, and achieve larger vibration amplitudes at lower cost of power consumption, but are applicable only in ordinary operating conditions which do not require higher precision and accuracy in directional vibration, or consistent reso nance and vibrator stability during fluctuating load condi tions in mass, flexibility, and damping. Furthermore, conventional non linear vibration systems are suitable for effective operation when a vibration frequency differ ent from the exciting frequency is required, or when it is used to drive a large vibration system. Also, changes in the mass of the external load, in rigidity, in damping, or combined random changes of varying kinds, will result in instability of vibration. For these reasons, the range of applications of previously known non linear vibration de vices have been limited. Alternatively, complicated and costly electrical feedback devices must be employed. Con sequently, a complex supplemental system is usually re quired for providing electrical control or other kinds of assistance to non linear vibrators of the prior art in order to accommodate operating conditions of the type men tioned above. These complex supplemental systems invaria bly add to the cost of energy consumption as well as re stricting the practical adaptability of the vibrator to different applications by causing the overall structure to be bulky and inflexible. Although research and development of non linear vibra tion systems has had a history of many years due to the vastness, richness, and variability of this field, a series of fundamental problems remained unsolved prior to the instant invention, including those mentioned above. For example, how many limiting rings of the phase space are there in an ordinary differential system of n The difficulties suggested in the preceding are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather are among many which may tend to reduce the effectiveness and satisfaction with prior vibration devices. Other noteworthy problems may also exist however, those presented above should be suffi cient to demonstrate that non linear electromagnetic vibra tion devices appearing in the past will admit to worthwhile improvement. It is therefore a general object of the invention to provide a novel, non linear electromagnetic vibration de vice which will obviate or minimize difficulties of the type previously described. According to the present invention there is provided a non linear electromagnetic vibration device comprising a first vibration part, a second vibration part, an electromagnetic source comprising an armature included in one of the vibration parts and an electromagnetic core included in the other of the vibration parts, means for operably connecting the first and second vibration parts to permit relative motion there between, said means including at least one non linear, bellows plate spring electrical power means for supplying electrical current to the electromagnetic source for electromagnetically inducing movement of the armature within the core in opposition to a non linear restoring spring force of the connecting means whereby a resonant, non linear electromagnetic vibration may be induced between the first and the second vibration parts. The preferred form of the invention preferably provides a non linear electromagnetic vibration device yielding stable and consistent oscillations independent of varying loads and which is highly efficient in energy consumption. The device is highly adaptive for use in varying application environments and will exhibit precise linear motion without external guides or bearings. The preferred arrangement is capable of consistently maintaining a harmonic resonance state and is highly compact and easily mountable in varying incorporating units. The device is generally frinctionless in operation and generally maintenance fre and as such may be sealed. A non linear electromagnetic vibration device as dis closed in an embodiment of the instant invention utilizes sectionalized waveform plate springs of various selectable elastic curvature and overall structural configuration. A plurality of waveform plate springs are sequentially con nected and rigidly fixed in respective first and second sectionalized waveform plate spring sets. A first and second vibrating part respectively including an electomag netic armature and core of the electromagnetic source are arranged for fixed connection to said first and second spring sets such that dual cooperatively oscillating struc tures each of a parallelogram cross section are formed and are effective to provide precise guiding action during oscillation. Furthermore, convenient mechanical frequency conversion is made available through selective adjustments in the respective masses of the vibrating parts, and the number of plate springs in each sectionalized waveform plate spring set. Prior to providing a detailed description of various preferred embodiments of the invention it may be worthwhile to briefly establish operative terminology in connection with the subject non linear electromagnetic device. In the instant invention the electromagnetic oscilla tion installation may be regarded as a bipolar oscillating system. The core of the electromagnet and other structures fixedly connected thereto in combination constitutes a first vibrating part of a given mass M1. On the other hand, the armature of the electromagnet and other struct tures fixedly connected thereto in combination constitutes a second vibrating part of a given mass M2. During oscil lation, these two oscillating parts make reciprocating motion relative to their respective static positions prior to such oscillations. The corresponding amplitudes of oscillation of these vibrating parts are inversely propor tional to the associated given mass as given by the equa tion A1 A2 M2 M1 wherein A1 and A2 represent respective amplitudes and M1 and M2 represents respective masses of the vibrating parts. Of these two vibrating parts, the one of comparatively smaller total mass has comparatively larger amplitude, and is referenced herein as the main oscillating or main vibrating part. The other vibrating part of larger mass and smaller oscillation amplitude is referenced herein as the relative oscillating or relative vibrating part. The total amplitude of the bipolar system, A, is the sum of the main vibrating part and the relative vibrating part amplitudes, A1 A2. If the mass ratio M2 M1 is greater than ten 10 , that is A1 is 10 times A2, then the whole electromagnetic oscillating system can be regarded as a single proton oscillating system. In this event, the total amplitude value A may be regarded as being approximately equal to A1. Similarly, it is possible to adjust the amplitude ratios of the two vibrating parts by adjustments in their respective mass. Accordingly, depend ing on the manner of connection of various system compo nents to the electromagnet core or to the electromagnet armature, main and relative vibrating parts of various different mass, configuration, and oscillation amplitude may be formed. Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals indicate like parts, certain preferred embodiments of the instant invention will be described in detail. In refer ence to Figures 1 4, a non linear electromagnetic vibration device 20 is shown utilizing sectionalized bellows or wave form plate springs. A laminated magnetic core 6 and core seat 7 of an electromagnet are riveted together. Core seat 7 is connected to lateral frame elements 4 through bolts 12. Lateral frames 4 are connected at respective ends via bolts 14 through sectionalized bellows or waveform plate spring sets 9 to mechanical tuning members 10 and 11 which may serve as balancing weight block type tuning elements for tuning the resonant point of the oscillating system by an increase or decrease in mass. In some instances a top cover 50 may be connected to lateral frames 4 note FIGURE 15 . So configured, the core 6, core seat 7, frames 4, weight block members 10 and 11, and an optional top cover see FIGURE 15 , and all connecting bolts and coupled por tions of the sectionalized bellows spring sets 9 together constitute a first oscillation or vibration part or collec tive mass. Tuning members 10 and 11 are primarily effec tive near the resonance state, are mounted via screws 14 on the outside of sectionalized waveform plate spring sets 9 and are operative to enable the entire vibration assembly to remain persistently near a primary and or lower order resonance states. An exploded view of a central area of Figures 1 3 is particularly shown in Figure 4. Armature 5 is formed from riveted and plied metallic material, T shaped, and fixed to upper support plate 56 and lower support plate 57. The plates 56 and 57 are bolted and soldered to front and rear support members 2 and 3 positioned adjacent opposing sides of the magnetic core. The plates 56 and 57 extend through a magnetic coil 8 which is operably disposed within the magnetic core 6. The armature is externally tightly en cased by coil 8. This arrangement is more clearly illus strated in Figure 3. Front and rear supports 2 and 3 are fixedly connected to a base plate 1, and also to a portion of a respective sectional spring set 9 via bolts 14 note Figure 3 . So configured, armature 5, coil 8, support members 2 and 3, base plate 1, upper and lower connecting plates 56 and 57, all connecting bolts and portions of sec tional spring sets 9 connected thereto together constitute a second oscillation or vibration part of collective mass. In the arrangement described above, the first vibrat ing part including the magnetic core has a larger mass than the second vibrating part which includes the magnetic arma ture, and therefore has a smaller vibration amplitude rela tive thereto. Thus, the second vibrating part including the armature, and having a larger vibration amplitude, is referred to as the main vibrating part, and the first vi brating part including the core and having a lower vibra tion amplitude is referred to as the relative vibrating part. The terminology as applied is dependent upon the relative mass and vibration amplitudes of the two vibrating parts, and may be reversed if the relative mass and ampli tudes are different in alternative embodiments. Different structural connections of various components in distinct embodiments of the instant invention may yield many combi nations of main and relative vibrating parts. For in stance, the lateral frames 4, instead of the front and rear support plates 2 and 3, may be connected to the base plate 1 in an alternative embodiment and may or may not result in a reversal in relative collective mass and vibration ampli tude. It is possible to adjust the size ratio of compara tive amplitudes through adjustments in mass ratio, in order to meet the requirements of varying applications. A vernier bolt 13, shown in Figures 2 and 3, has front and rear sections of different screw pitch. The front screw section is adapted to the bore 7B on armature base seat 7, and the rear screw section is adapted to the bore 4B on a protruding central part of the bottom of frame 4. Turning of vernier screw 13 will cause the riveted core 6 and core base seat 7 to advance or retreat relative to the frame 4. Because the frame 4 is at a static position when not oscillating, it does not vary in relation to the arma ture 5. In this manner, an adjustment via turning the vernier bolt 13 effects an adjustment of the size of air gap between the core 6 and the armature 5. Locking bolts 12 are also shown for fixing the core 6 to the frame 4 they are symmetrically mounted on opposing sides of the arrangement. Each bolt 12 passes through a bore 4A on a corresponding side wall of frame 4, and turns into the bore 7A on core seat 7. It physically connects the frame 4 with the core seat 7. When it is necessary to adjust the air gap of the electromagnet, one must first loosen locking bolt 12. The presence of elongated bore 4A permits the above described adjustments in the electromagnet air gap. Upon completion of air gap adjustments, bolt 12 is re tightened in order to fix the core 6 in its new position relative to the armature and frame. The respective manner of connection between the main and relative vibrating parts and the sectional band spring sets 9 is illustrated in detail at Figure 5. Nuts and bolts 52 and 14 fixedly couple respective mid portions of each sectional band spring set to the main vibrating part, and respective end portions of each sectional band spring set to the relative vibrating part. In alternative embodi ments, this connection may be reversed such that the mid portion of the plate spring sets is connected to the rela tive vibrating part and the end portions to the main vi brating part. In this Figure, a top structure 50, as re ferred to above, is also shown. Each sectional band spring set includes a series of sectionalized plate springs sepa rated by shims 17 which prevent friction during oscillating motion of the springs. In the disclosed embodiment, three shims are disposed between each adjacent pair of section alized plate springs. In Figure 6, an alternative embodiment is shown where in a second sectional band spring set 53 is attached to each original spring set 9 on each side of the assembly. Separators 54 are respectively disposed between spring sets 9 and 53. In addition, screws 55 are shown, which may be used to fix the frame 4, instead of end pieces 2 and 3, to bed plate 1. The construction of sectionalized bellows or wave form plate springs 17 is illustrated in Figure 5, and also in Figure 7 which shows a half portion of a single section alized plate spring. On the center and two sides of each plate spring 17, a respective mounting plane 15 having two tap holes thereon is located Figure 7 shows only half a spring . In each tap hole, a stud screw 14 is placed for means of coupling. Successive plate springs are pressed together via stud screws, front and rear support members 2 and 3, and press bars 51. Intervening washers or shims may be disposed in between one plate spring and the next. In the embodiments described above, the mounting planes at the ends of each plate spring are coupled to opposing side walls of the frame 4, and a central mounting plane is coupled to a corresponding front or rear support member 2 or 3. The sectionalized bellows waveform plate spring sets are non linear elastic components. The non linear charac teristics may be conveniently selected and designed to suit different application environments. Figures 8A, 8B, and 8C illustrate a half portion of several alternative designs of such plate springs. As can be seen, the spring may have an edge which is straight or curved to be concave, or convex in shape. Each spring set may include a combination of such plate springs successively arranged as presented above. Figures 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, and 9E illustrate respec tive edge diagrams of such plate springs. These edges may be made to satisfy various sine, exponent, or other func tional curves which reflect a corresponding elastic behav ior of the spring. In the overall vibration assembly, each waveform plate spring of one configuration may be used in combination with waveform plate springs of the same or other kinds to suit the particular requirements of differ ent application environments. These sectionalized plate springs have smooth non linear characteristics and a wide range of potential behavior in combination to support a correspondingly wide range of desirable flexibility and rigidity. There is a very minimal internal damping, and a very long fatigue life. The plate springs provide high precision in directional motion, and high adjustability for self adapting control. In all these aspects the subject invention manifests optimal performance in comparison with common linear springs, sectionally linear composite springs, and other existing non linear springs. The number of waveform plate springs in each spring set 9 may be varied and selectively adjusted to vary the vibration frequency responsive to an exciting frequency from a source. If the number of plate springs is raised to equal the square of an integral times the number required for a harmonic response, the vibration frequency may be multiplied a corresponding integral times. Similarly, if the number of plate springs is made to equal the square of an inverse integral times of the number required for a harmonic response, then the vibration frequency can be made to equal an inverse integral times of the exciting fre quency. In this manner, frequency conversion and multipli cation under harmonic resonance can be achieved via mechan ical adjustments of the number of plate springs. The need for a complex electronic frequency converter is completely eliminated. With the subject vibration assembly, the reso nance state can be persistently maintained under no load, or varying rated load conditions. The concept is based on the unique characteristic of strong non linear systems in being able to generate harmonic resonance. The spring set stiffness may be varied by varying the number of plate springs, and thus can be made to equal the square of an integral or of an inverse integral times the degree of stiffness under harmonic response. The inherent vibration frequency may be raised an integral times or an inverse integral times by combined adjustments in the mass of vi brating parts and the vibration stiffness. Accordingly, the subject vibration assembly is able to achieve harmonic resonance characteristics in mechanical vibration as in non linear electromagnetic wave vibration. The instant device enables frequency multiplication and frequency con version of harmonic response to be achieved for resonance type mechanical vibration without requiring an independent electronic frequency converter device. When the vibration device is activated, and electrical exciting current flows through coil 8 note again FIGURE 3 , pulsed attraction is generated by electromagnetic action. The spring sets are correspondingly elastically flexed in unison towards a common direction along a linear axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the upper con necting plate 56. Because the springs are sectionalized, and because opposing ends of each section of each plate spring are couple to different vibrating parts, main and relative, as discussed above, two self reciprocating par allelograms are formed which share a major side along an axis parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the upper connecting plate 56. Each side wall of frame 4 constitutes the other major side of each parallelogram, and a corre sponding section of each plate spring collectively forms every minor side of each of said two parallelograms. As shown in Figure 10A, parallelogram A is reciprocating in direction of arrows A while parallelogram B is reciprocat ing in unison in the direction of arrows B , and both par allelograms share a common edge along an axis parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the top plate 56. This arrangement is more particularly illustrated in Figure 10B, wherein the parallelograms A and B are schematically shown apart from the underlying structure, and cooperatingly reciprocate in unison. The dashed lines illustrate succes sive positions of the parallelograms during oscillation. In this manner, a highly stabilized cooperative reciprocat ing motion is achieved together with precise linear guiding action between the corresponding parallelogram structures. The cooperatingly reciprocating dual parallelogram structure of the instant invention provides highly accurate and precise directional reciprocating linear vibration without use of external guiding structures. In the absence of external guiding structure, guiding friction and wear are eliminated. The dual reciprocating parallelogram structure manifests a guiding influence on each other to ensure stable cooperative oscillations. Without requiring external guiding structures for stable and precise vibra tion, the instant vibration assembly has a greatly expanded range of application and may even be enclosed within a sealed container as no maintenance is required. When resonance motion takes place in non linear type electromagnetic vibration facility of this invention due to the in flow of resonance exciting current, the iron core of the electromagnet and the mass of parts rigidly connected with it as well as the armature of electromagnet and mass of parts rigidly connected with it exhibit a relative motion with each other. As noted above, the amplitudes are distributed inversely proportional to the ratio of relative mass of the two parts. In one embodiment of this invention, frame 4, upper cover 50 and other members are connected with the iron core 6 of electromagnet and the whole structure is located out side the structure of armature of electromagnet front sup port seat 2, rear support seat 3 and other members. So, in the whole vibration machinery, if the total mass of mem bers, and parts rigidly connected to the iron core of elec tromagnet compared with the total mass of members and parts rigidly connected to the armature of electromagnet is smaller, then the amplitude produced in the electromagnet iron core and members rigidly connected with it will be larger than that produced in electromagnet armature and members rigidly connected to it. Thus, the former struc ture will become the main resonance part of the vibration system. Such electromagnetic vibration facility may be referred to as an external relative motion type electromag netic vibration facility. When the working frequency current through half wave rectifier flows in the facility according to the electric circuit shown in the example of Figure 11A the waveform of current is shown in Figure 11B. During the positive half wave cycle, current passes through electromagnetic coil 8. Electromagnetic attraction force is produced between electromagnet iron core 6 and magnet armature 7, thus ena bling the iron core 6 together with the iron core base seat 7, frame 4, upper cover and other members rigidly connected to it to drive both ends of the front and rear sets of bellows plate spring groups 9 and to produce motion rela tive to the armature 5 which is rigidly connected on the base plate 1 and front and rear support seats 2, 3, thus, reducing deformation in the bellows plate spring group and storing a certain amount of elastic potential energy. During the negative half cycle, no current flows through electromagnetic coil 8, and electromagnetic attraction forces diminish dissipate . The iron core system, under the action of a recovering spring force is released from the armature 5 and moves in an opposite direction. With periodic motions, the main resonance part of the vibration system produces fixed direction reciprocating vibration at a frequency of the working frequency current. By adjusting the air gap adjustment bolt 13 and making the distance of air gap between iron core 6 and armature 5 a little larger than a half amplitude of fixed direction reciprocating vibration, it is possible to prevent the possibility of a collision of iron core 6 with armature 5 in motion, and assure the production of maximum electromagnetic attraction force. Because of the non linear elasticity characteris tics of a bellows type plate spring group 9 which may pro duce pulse type non linear motion characteristics, the number of spring pieces in the bellows type plate spring group can be adjusted to vary the total rigidity of the vibration system and to realize one and more than one har monic resonance. Utilizing characteristics and control and adjustment operations substantially as described above it has been determined that when the frequency of vibration reaches 3000 times min., the total amplitude reaches 4 to 6 mm. Advantageously it is also possible, with the instant invention, to vary the amplitude of the vibration by vary ing the input voltage. Figure 12 illustrates a dual vibrator push pull reso nance state. Two small scale electromagnetic vibrators each with power of 100 watts are used. Their respective coils are fed through the same power wire to enable synchronous vibration movement and to form a push pull co operating relationship. The vibrators work in unison and are able to drive a large working body 18 of large mass and inertia. In this manner, the subject invention employs small scale vibrators in cooperation for driving a massive working body. In so doing, the subject invention reduces the required size of the vibrating assembly and also the otherwise required stiffness of the working body. The dual 100 watt vibrators acting in unison are able to generate the practical effects of a large 500 watt scale vibrator, thus achieving a significant increased efficiency with reduced power consumption. Push pull resonance can not be achieved with conventional revolving link exciters and vibrators or inertia type exciters and vibrators, because these type of devices can not be strictly synchronized. The subject invention is able to employ a single power source for driving a plurality of electromagnetic vibrators so as to ensure that they function in a resonance state with the same frequency and at the same phase. A modified version of the external relative motion type electromagnetic vibration facility mentioned above exists in an internal relative motion type electromagnetic vibration facility. If the total mass of the electromagnet iron core and the members and parts rigidly connected to it is compared with the total mass of electromagnet armature and the members and parts rigidly connected to it, and the former one is greater, then the amplitude obtained by the iron core system will be relatively smaller than that ob tained by the armature system and the iron core system becomes the relative vibration part, while the armature system becomes the main vibrating part. In a preferred embodiment of the instant invention a solenoid type electromagnet is utilized. In comparison with a common n or E type electromagnet, the solenoid type has a larger electromagnetic attractive force and travel, and is much easier to connect its two ends to double elas tic components, and to carry out position fixing and air gap trimming. In addition, the structure of the entire electromagnetic vibrator is made power head like so that it is easy to connect to and maintain. The core, upper cover and adjoining frame to the core, the armature, and front and rear support blocks of the armature all can be used as the unit for producing the principal vibration. In this manner, the structure can be employed flexibly and mechani cal vibration can be sent out conveniently through attach ments with simple connecting parts at a number of alterna tive positions. A significant breakthrough in the technical field of non linear vibrating machines made by the present invention lies in the fact that subject springs have been selected to exhibit exponential sine waveforms. A curve for shifting its standard rigidity is determinable and the parameters for the springs optimal working characteristics are con veniently selectable. This type of non linear vibration not only depends upon the average rigidity of the vibratory elastic component but has also a close relationship with its rigidity curve and structural damping. The exponen tial sine waveform spring adopted in the present invention has smaller structural damping than other springs and the relationship between stress and strain is approximately a logarithmic function. Let f be the stress and ℓ the strain. Then ℓ α1n 1 ρf , where α and ρ are parameters which can be determined by the method of least square from experimental data. Con versely, f can be written as an exponential function of the strain Even with an elastic vibration component of excellent performance, normal operation of a vibrating machine still cannot be fully ensured with conventional systems. This is because external conditions may vary in different ways when the machine is in operation. Thus, for example, when it is used for cutting, the damping in cutting would vary with the change of the hardness and dimension of the work piece being cut when it is used for conveying and sifting of material, the quantity and variety of the material would entail change in the vibrating mass and when it is used in compressing gases vibratory compressor , which is equiva lent to attaching a gaseous spring, the change of rigidity curve would arise. The change in these conditons would affect the type of respective vibrations and may cause them to transfer from the near resonance area to the far reso nance area and to come out of stable limiting rings and get into a non stable state, with the result that the vibrating machine either could not operate normally or would exhibit reduced performance during operation. The present invention has effected three kinds of vibration control, viz Damping control stability control for varying damp ing Rigidity control stability control for varying rigid ity and Mass control stability control for varying mass . The fundamental principle of control is the method of feedback function, i.e., a preset feedback self compensat ing function is to be formed by designing electromagnetic, elastic, and mass damping systems. Once the working condi tions of a vibrating machine undergoes a change within a certain range, the feedback function would automatically play a role to control and offset the change in external conditions so that the machines may continue to work nor mally. The feedback function is implemented by the following procedures Non linear rectangular bellows type plate spring group is a generally significant operating element of the subject invention by which the main characteristics of the elec tromagnetic vibration facility and hence, those of the vibration machinery using such facility as its power source are determined. The main characteristic of this element is the appli cation of thin bellows type plate spring pieces with a generally rectangular outer dimension, and separate segment sine configuration or exponential function and the space lamination of such plate springs into a group. Each bellows type plate spring piece has an assembly hole or separate segment assembly plane, so as to use a bolt for fixing and restraining it. Aluminum washer shims may be used between these assembly planes, so that friction may be avoided, when deformation between plate springs is pro duced. The main characteristics of the subject bellows type plate springs may be described in some detail as follows A conventional electromagnetic vibration unit typical ly uses a shape E shape or H shape electromagnet. An electromagnetic vibration facility of this invention uses a solenoid type electromagnet wherein the armature is gener ally T shaped and an electromagnetic core is generally U shaped which may better concentrate its electromagnetic attraction in the magnetic field. Furthermore, the elec tromagnet of the instant invention is made to include unique electromagnetic elements. Silicon steel sheet of high silicon content is used to replace that of low silicon content as a basic material of the electromagnet. In this manner, larger electromagnetic attraction forces can be ob tained than that of a conventional unit. In addition, dual reciprocation structures of parallelogram shaped cross sec tion can be easily constructed to include both front and rear sectionalized waveform plate spring sets on opposing sides of the electromagnet so as to assure a high precision fixed direction motion of the vibration system during sys tem operation. A sieving machine is a kind of general machinery for selecting solid material according to grain grading. Most conventional sieving machines employ a connecting rod or inertia vibration mechanism constructed with a rotary type motor. The power consumption of such units is high while vibration frequency can not be easily in creased. Moreover, it is difficult to control and adjust the stability of vibration of such machines with the change in the mass of body which is being sieved. As shown in Figure 13, one support type sieving machine with a bi layer sieving is constructed including a non linear electromagnetic vibration facility 50 as the power source. The non linear electromagnetic vibration dynamic head 50 is fixedly connected with holder 51 to a sieving frame 52. At its front upper part, there is a hopper 53 for feeding material, and in its middle part and at its bottom, is a layer of sieving net 54. At both sides of the nets 54, a tension holder is fixed and the net 54 can be tensioned by a tension device fixed on the sieving frame 52 and tension bolts 57. In the material discharge direction of sieving frame 52 and at the bottom of frame 52, are hoppers 58 and 59 for discharging material are respectively connected and by which the material sieved by using the sieving net with bi layer and different net can be collected based on coarse, medium and fine grades. The whole sieving frame is placed on the support 60 of sieving machine throught three groups of non linear type control elastic elements installed respectively at its two sides. Non linear type control elastic elements consist of a a combination spring group which is composed of rectangular bellows type plate spring group 61, compressed spiral spring 62 and tension spiral springs 63, and b the spiral coil spring 64 or c other kinds of proper non linear type elastic elements. At the bottom of support 60 of sieving machine, a vibration isolator piece 65 is installed. When exciting vibration current flows in the dynamic head 50 of non linear electromagnetic vibrator, the elec tromagnetic vibrator is excited, by which the sieving frame is directly actuated to cause working vibration. The number of bellows type plate spring pieces of the electro magnetic vibrator can be adjusted to cause the machine to reach a resonant state. In reliance on the self feedback characteristics of the non linear spring group, the reso nant state of the sieving machine can be kept stable con sistently within the scope of mass variation from no load to full load. Compared with a connecting rod type vibration sieving machine having a conventional rotary motor and under the conditions of same area and productivity of sieving net, it has been found that the power consumption of this sieving machine can be 5 to 10 times less than that of the latter one. When concrete surfaces are deposited by layers, the surface of each layer must be roughened after removing an outer surface skin to ensure binding strength between suc cessive layers. It is also often necessary in building maintenance and renewal jobs to roughen a generally planar concrete, asphalt or other similar surface. Conventional manual roughening is low in efficiency and heavy in labor intensity with a high rate of loss in concrete. A method of roughening by water under high pres sure not only employs complicated and costly equipment with high energy consumption but is also subject to rather rigid seasonal restrictions. A method of roughening by sand blasting, besides requiring large energy consumption, also wastes large amounts of sand and requires auxiliary work such as cleaning, material transportation, etc. As shown in Figure 14, a concrete chisel roughening machine including a non linear electromagnetic vibration unit is shown. At the front lower part of the dynamic head base plate of the electromagnetic vibrator is a roughening chisel head. The chisel head includes a plurality of chisel tips 31 arranged on a chisel tip plate 32. Plate 32 is fixedly connected with a base plate 33 of the roughening chisel head and the base plate 1 of the electromagnetic vibrator. The coarse or dense distribution and regular arrangement of chisel tips can be adjusted after disassem bling the chisel tip plate 32. The heads of chisel tips 31 are welded with carbide alloy, wear resistant steel and may be sharpened by multiple wheel grinding. The base plate 1 installed with the dynamic head of the electromagnetic vibrator and the part of the roughening chisel head is connected with a base plate 34 of the carriage by a control spring group which includes three groups of combination springs being composed of spiral coil spring 35 and pull spring 36, and two groups of rectangular bellow type plate spring groups 37. Other kinds of non linear elastic ele ments, such as U type plate spring etc. can also be used as control spring groups. Pretension adjustment of the combination spring group can be made by bolt 38 and nut 39. A controller is mounted at a front lower part of the base plate 34 of the carriage for controlling the depth of chiseling and cutting. A spiral coil spring 41 and a con trol head 42, welded with a carbide alloy tip, is enplaced within a seat 40 connected to the base plate 34. On the control head 42, there is a guide key slot. Along the guide is a limit bolt 43, the control head can move for a certain degree of controlling the chiseling depth, thereby adapting itself to change in a certain working condition. Self lubricating sleeve 46 is installed between the shaft 44, which is connected on the base plate 34 of carriage, and two wheels 45, thus, making the operation easy and maintenance simplified. At a rear end of the base plate 34 of the carriage, handle seat 47 and handle 48 are in stalled, and between seat 47 and base plate 34, a shock absorbing seat 49 is installed for damping shock during operation. The concrete chisel roughening machine, by electromag netic vibration, is a kind of small scale, flexible and carriage type construction machine tool which can be operated by one man. When exciting vibration current flows in the dynamic head of electromagnetic vibrator, the dynamic head is vibrated, and the vibration can be con verted into workpiece chiseling and cutting action by the roughening chisel head. An adjustment of the number of bellow type plate spring pieces of electromagnetic vibrator can cause the machine to reach a resonant state then, the roughening operation can start. During operation, the worker should press the chisel head firmly on the ground, walk backwards, slightly moving the operation handle to the left and right, and in the respect of construction tech nology, preflatten the concrete which is still during the initial solidified period by concrete flat plate vibrator for vibrating the concrete on surface layer as technical preparation, thus, ensuring the removal of an upper layer on the concrete surface with high efficiency. In the case of concrete with different strength owing to different pouring periods, i.e. under the conditions of varying scope of rigidity and damping of external load, corresponding feedback variation in rigidity and damping of whole vibra tion system can be employed via the non linear control plate springs having self feedback regulating characteris tics. Thus, machine performance can be kept stable. As shown in Figure 15, a flat plate concrete vibrator including the non linear electromagnetic vibrator drive is shown. A group of non linear cantilever type plate springs 19 or other kinds of non linear elastic elements are in stalled between the dynamic head of electromagnetic vibra tor and a working flat plate 20. In this embodiment the entire dynamic head of electromagnetic vibrator is in stalled in a cantilver form. Onto the working flat plate 20, one arcuate impact block is welded, the position of which is corresponding to that of another arcuate impact block welded under the base plate 1 of the dynamic head of electromagnetic vibrator. A layer of polyurethane rubber is adhered on the surfaces of the impact blocks so as to reduce the impact noise. The distance between impact blocks can be adjusted by a washer piece for controlling the impact level. A connecting ring is welded at the four corners of working flat plate 20. Then, lifting ropes on the edge may be secured to connector bores on the flat plate 20 can be employed when the concrete flat plate vibrator is used for vibrating a surface of thin concrete. When exciting vibration current flows in the dynamic head of electromagnetic vibrator, the head is vibrated, and vibrating force, vibrating moment and the impact force produced by the impact blocks are generated on the working base plate 20. The direction of resultant vibration is mainly perpendicular to the base plate 20, and the resul tant vibration is transmitted downward, at the same time, there are also horizontal components, thus, making the concrete flat plate vibrator for vibrating the surface of concrete haul easily and more conveniently. Adjustment of the spring piece number of bellows type plate spring of the electromagnetic vibrator can cause the machine to reach the resonant state. When vibration is met with the different concrete dilute or dense level of different concrete , the rigidity of the external load will be changed. At this time, self feedback adjustment will be made responsive to changing load by the non linear plate springs, so as to make total rigidity of the system nearly unchange and main taining the stable vibrating working characteristics. When the vibration strength produced by this machine is similar to that generated by flat plate vibrator with 1.1 KW inertia type vibration motor, the power consumed is only 0.1 0.2 KW. The non linear elastic component of the vibrator is provided via waveform plate springs fixedly bounded in relation to the electromagnetic core and armature. Smooth non linear characteristics are generated with enhanced efficiency in many functional respects. The degree of non linearity may be conveniently selected and altered by design and various combinations of flexible rigidity can be obtained with minimal internal damping and longer fatigue life. The range of self stability and adjustability, and precision of directional control are greatly expanded. The vibration amplitude can be multiplied by a factor of 2 or 3 and above. Additionally, harmonic resonance frequency multiplication, reduction and conversion can be achieved mechanically and simplistically without requiring a supple mental electronic controlling device. The invention enables a plurality of vibrators to reach push pull resonance, resulting in increased effi ciency relative to a larger scale single vibrator of equi valent yield. The increased efficiency may be reflected by a reduction in energy consumption approaching 50 and more. With a simple structure, not requiring any auxiliary electronic control mechanism, the instant vibrator has greatly enhanced overall effectiveness, performance effi ciency, and range of self adaptability to varying applica tion environments, as well as a reduced energy consumption requirement from 1 to ten fold less than a corresponding assembly according to the prior art. With the instant non linear vibration device, a much greater amplitude and vibration acceleration can be ob tained for the same vibration frequency e.g., for a vibra tion frequency of 50 Hz, double amplitude of 6 to 7 mm or more is obtainable. Under complicated and randomly varying loads, the vibrator of the instant invention can always maintain a stable resonance state by its self adapting feedback behavior without any electrical control mechanism. The instant vibrator has a simple structure, produces precise vibrating motion without the use of external guides, or requires no lubrication, generates minimal noise, can be readily sealed, has long service life, and employs a power head like construction for easy mounting to a base component.
