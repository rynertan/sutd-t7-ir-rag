# Process for production of sterically stabilised, wholly non charged aqueous polymer dispersions.

## Abstract
Sterically stabilised aqueous polymer dispersions free from charged species are made by emulsifying in water ethylenically unsaturated monomer s , soluble in water to the extent of 0.8 8 by weight but giving rise to a polymer which is insoluble, and polymerising the monomer s in that state in the presence of a a non ionisable azo initiator which is water soluble and substantially monomer insoluble and b a block or graft copolymer stabiliser of specified struc ture.
