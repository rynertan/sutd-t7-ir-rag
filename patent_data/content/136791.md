# Neocarzinostatin derivatives and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
Neocarzinostatin derivatives, having anticancer activity, have the formula A SMA NCS SMA A wherein NCS represents a divalent neocarzinostatin re sidue in which a hydrogen atom is removed from each of the primary amino groups of the alanine residue at the N terminal of neocarzinostatin and of the primary amino group of the lysine residue at the 20th position from the N terminal of neocarzinostatin and SMA represents a monovalent partially half esterified styrene maleic acid copolymer re sidue having a weight average molecular weight of 800 to 2,500 and consisting of structural units of a the styrene residue
