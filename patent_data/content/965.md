# Cathode foil for electrolytic capacitors.

## Abstract
Improved cathode foil of an Al Mn alloy for electrolytical capacitors with which a higher capacitance value and, in accordance with a further elaboration, a higher impact strength of the foil is obtained. To this end the foil has next to 0.2 2 weight of Mn a Cu content between 0.15 and 5.3 and preferably a Ti content between 0.03 and 0.5 .
