# Process for producing semipermeable membrane.

## Abstract
A process for producing a semipermeable membrane having a high flux, excellent in solute rejection and useful for reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration and the like which com prises dipping a semipermeable membrane of acrylonitrile polymer containing 40 100 by mole of acrylonitrile in a solution of an amine and or an alkali, or casting a solution of said polymer containing an amine and or an alkali to prepare a semipermeable membrane, and optionally, treat ing the semipermeable membrane thus obtained with plasma.
