# Separation of chromium from scrap.

## Abstract
To recover chromium from scrap such as superalloy scrap, the scrap is melted, subjected to controlled oxidation to oxidize reactive metals the oxidized reactive metals are removed as slag and then the partially refined melt is sul phided and cooled slowly to produce a coarse grained solid in which most of the chromium is present in a phase consisting mainly of a chromium sulphide.
