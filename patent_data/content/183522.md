# Automobile antenna device.

## Abstract
An automobile antenna device in which broadcast waves received by the automobile body are effeciently detected so that the various kinds of receivers equipped with the automobile can be supplied the detected signal. This device comprises an electrostatic shield case which is formed an opening thereat to face to a metal plate of the automobile body and a loop antenna being internally arranged in the electrostatic shield case so that the loop antenna can be facingly provided to the opening in its close vicinity. The loop antenna is equipped with a plurality of loops which are respectively formed by wound antenna wires, and the respective loops are sectorially arranged with the side of the electrostatic shield opening side as their centers. Therefore, the surface current being induced by the broadcast waves and flowing in the metal plate of the automobile body can be efficiently detected, and there is no need of pole antenna and others externally exposed, and further, the automobile antenna device can be easily obtained with small sizes and high accuracy.
