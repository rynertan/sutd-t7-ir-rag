# Stabilization of perchlorethylene dielectric fluids.

## Abstract
Method of inhibiting the attack by perchloroethylene on copper and organic polymers subject to said attack, such as poly para xylylene, by adding to perchloroethylene from 20 to 1000 ppm of a stabilizer having the general formula NH₂ NH R where R H, C N, or N NH₂ The preferred concentration of the stabilizer is from 40 to 500 ppm. Also disclosed is an electrical apparatus containing copper or organic polymer subject to attack by perchloro ethylene and perchloroethylene containing the stabilizer.
