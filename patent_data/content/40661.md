# Method and apparatus for sorting out defective empty cans automatically.

## Abstract
The method and apparatus includes a flange portion inspecting process and a print quality inspecting process. The apparatus provides an empty can feed discharge mechanism E for conveying a continuously incoming group of empty cans to a predetermined position in an inspecting station S2 intermittently one after another in an equally spaced manner, a rotating mechanism F for forcibly rotating the empty can a which has been posi tioned and stopped in said inspecting station, a permanent magnet PM for exerting a static magnetic field on the flange portion a2 of the empty can being rotated in said inspecting station, a magnetic head MGH for detecting the change in the static magnetic field and converting it into an electrical signal, a photo sensor PH3 for receiv ing a reflected portion of light directed onto the flange portion and converting it into an electrical signal, a photo sensor PH1, PH2 for receiving a reflected portion of light directed onto the outer peripheral surface of an empty can on which the amount of light reflected varies according to the condition of the printed pattern, a discriminator circuit G for displaying the kind of defect on the basis of electrical signals from both said magnetic head and said photo sensors and putting out a reject command signal, and a rejector R for sorting defective empty cans from good empty cans upon receipt of a reject command signal from said discriminator circuit G .
