# IRREVERSIBLE DONOR DOPING OF CONJUGATED BACKBONE POLYMERS

## Abstract
Conjugated backbone polymers e.g., polyacetaylene , especially formed into a battery electrode, are contacted with a compound MR where M is an alkali metal and R is alkyl of 1 12 carbons, phenyl or alkylphenyl of 7 12 carbons. The method is particularly suited to treatment of battery elec trodes to avoid a high initial internal resistance.
