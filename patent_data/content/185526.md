# Solvent soluble fluorine containing polymer, coating composition containing the same and coating process thereof.

## Abstract
A solvent soluble fluorine containing polymer according to the present invention is a copolymer characterized by i consisting substantially of a fluoroolefin, b vinyl ether, and c an organosilicon compound having an olefinically unsaturated bond and a hydrohyzable group, ii said copolymer comprising, based on the total mole number 10 of said a c in the copolymer, 30 70 mol of a , 20 60 mol of b and 1 25 mol of c and iii said copolymer having a number average molecular weight Mn of 3000 200000 as measured by gel permea tion chromatography. Further, according to the present invention, a coating cornposition having excellent weathering resistance and solvent resistance comprising the above mentioned solvent soluble fluorine containing polymer and organic solvent is also provided. In addition a coating process of said coating composition is also provided.
