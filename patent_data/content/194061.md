# IMPROVEMENTS IN SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURES AND DEVICES

## Abstract
An artifical semiconductor 1 is composed a of multilayer structure with thin films of metal 1a or insulator 1b or semiconductor in alternation. The semiconductor 1 is com bined with one or more other bodies 2, 3, 5 which may be of similar multi layered construction but with a different period or film thickness to provide a diode, a transistor or an amplifying device with a high speed response to millimeter waves.
