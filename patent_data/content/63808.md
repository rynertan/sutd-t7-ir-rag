# Photographic elements containing nondiffusible 6 2 thienylazo 3 pyridinol cyan dye releasing compounds.

## Abstract
Photographic elements are described which employ nondiffusible compounds having a releasable 6 2 thie nylazo 3 pyridinol cyan dye moiety or precursor there of, the compounds containing a in the 3 position of the thienylazo moiety a carboxy group, a salt thereof or a hydrolyable precursor thereof and b a ballasted carrier moiety which is capable of re leasing the diffusible 6 2 thienylazo 3 pyridinol dye moiety or precursor thereof under alkaline condi tions.
