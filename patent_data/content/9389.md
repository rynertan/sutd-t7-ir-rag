# Endless power transmission belt.

## Abstract
An endless power transmission belt 10 comprises a plurality of V belt components 11 spaced appart laterally of the direction of extent of the belt and a tie band 12 connecting the V belt components 11 together to form a unitary structure. The tie band 12 is composed of a plu rality of cord fabric layers 13 disposed one on top of an other, each layer 13 comprising parallel cords 17 which are embedded in an elastomeric material 15, 16 and which are inclined with respect to the direction of extent of the belt 10 . Each adjacent pair of cord fabric layers 13 have their cords mutually inclined at an angle between 95 and 155 , and also have a layer 14 of elastomeric material interposed therebetween to prevent the cords in said adjacent layers from rubbing against each other. The endless belt 10 has high stretchability both lengthwise and widthwise thereof, permitting the tie band 12 to con form to the shape of the V belt components 11 when the latter locate in pulley grooves.
