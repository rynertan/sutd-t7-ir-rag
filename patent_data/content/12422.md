# Heat resistant electrically insulated wires and a method for preparing the same.

## Abstract
A heat resistant electrically insulated wire has a com posite coating layer of a mixture of an inorganic fine powder and an inorganic polymer on a conductor and the composite coating layer has a resinous overcoat layer thereon. The composite coating layer has not artificially been fired, but is adapted to be converted into a ceramic layer when exposed to elevated temperatures during use.
