# SHEET COUNTER AND STACKER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system for counting and stacking a continuous stream of shingled or overlapping sheets in which the shingled sheets are transported by a first conveyor and fed into an optional counting means for individually counting the sheets. From the optical counting means, the sheets are fed into a second conveyor which imparts a concave transverse bow to the sheets thereby providing rigidity to the sheets. The sheets exit the second conveyor and are collected by a recovery means for stacking. The second conve..or further includes an insertion means activated by the optical counter for separating the stream of sheets. The action of the insertion means separates the stream of sheets so that a predetermined number of sheets are collected and stacked by the receiving means while the insertion means temporari ly supports the continuing stream of sheets. After removal of the completed stack of sheets, the insertion means retracts to its original position thereby transferring the newly forming stack of sheets to the receiving means without interrupting the continuous stream of sheets.
