# Method and apparatus for detecting surge in centrifugal compressors driven by electric motors.

## Abstract
A surge detection apparatus for use in a refrigeration system having a centrifugal compressor 12 driven by an electric motor 20 includes a first pressure transducer 32 for sensing a condenser pressure and a second pressure transducer 34 for sensing an evaporator pressure. A first bandpass digital filter 58 responsive to the condenser pressure and the evaporator pressure is provided for gener ating a first signal representative of the rate of change of the pressure developed across the compressor. A current trans former 24 is used to sense a current in the electric motor driving the compressor. A second bandpass digital filter 61 responsive to the motor current is provided for generating a second signal representative of the rate of change of the RMS current being drawn by the compressor drive motor. A third signal representative of a differential pressure threshold and a fourth signal representative of a first motor current threshold and a second motor current threshold are provided. A computing device 73 responsive to the first through fourth signals indicates when a valid surge is occurring in the compressor.
