# Method and apparatus for frame synchronization of a supplementary information signal transmitted by level division multiplexing.

## Abstract
Digital transmission system of a supplementary informa tion signal, added to a multilevel main signal by altering the waveforms corresponding to extreme levels, in which the synchronization of the receiving apparatus, that has to recover the supplementary information signal, is obtained by duly processing the counts of the altered waveforms occur ring in predetermined portions of the frame into which the supplementary information signal is organized.
