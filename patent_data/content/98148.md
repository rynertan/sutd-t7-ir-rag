# Process for manufacture of high bulk paper.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for the manufacture of high bulk paper, or a high bulk layer of a multi layered paper, which uses a mixture of fibres in a paper making bond forming state and substantially dry fibres. The dry fibres may be mixed with the conventional slurry of bond forming fibres shortly before the headbox. The web may be dried primarily by pressing, with the dry fibres remaining incompletely wetted throughout the process and ensuring a bulky pro duct through air driers need not be used. The invention also covers the novel product of this process.
