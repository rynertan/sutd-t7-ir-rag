# Confocal reflector system.

## Abstract
A reflective focussing system comprises two concave reflectors L1L2 and L3L4. Each reflector is a surface of revolution generated by rotating selected quadratic conic sections about an axis 13. The first reflector has its first focus S1 on the axis 13 and the second reflector L3L4 has its first focus S3 on, or at least centred on, the axis 13, and located on the side of the reflector L3L4 remote from the reflector L1L2. The second foci of the reflectors are commonly located at S2. Alternative arrangements are disclosed in which the second foci of the two reflectors are not commonly located at S2, but further means is provided to project radiation from the second focus of L1L2 to the second focus of L3L4 in which one or both of S2 and S3 are rings centred on the axis 13 rather than points in which adjacent pairs of reflectors are divided into portions, corresponding portions of the pair being confocal, but different portions sharing different common foci and in which radiation projected from L1L2 to L3L4 crosses the axis 13 nil, one or a plurality of times.
