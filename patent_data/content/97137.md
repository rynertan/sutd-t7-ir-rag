# A work table.

## Abstract
A work table e.g. for a computer operator and having a work surface which is vertically displaceable and rotatable about a horizontal axis in any vertical position to which it is moved. The displacement and rotation is affected by caliper linkages 63, 64 arranged at each side of the axis of rotation and extending downwardly from points of attachment 60, 61 on the underside of the work surface 4 . The linkages extend to separately operable lead screws 67, 68 rotatable to vary the included angles of the calipers and thus the height of the parts of the work surface to which they are attached. Each leadscrew 67, 68 is positionnally fixed to the worktable and supports its weight while providing part of a positive drive con nection between a device for turning the leadscrew and the work surface.
