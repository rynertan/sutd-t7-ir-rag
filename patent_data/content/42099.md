# SELF REGULATING NEUTRON COINCIDENCE COUNTER

## Abstract
A device for accurately measuring the mass of ²⁴⁰Pu and ²³⁹Pu in a sample having arbitrary moderation and mixed with various contaminants. The device utilizes a thermal neutron well counter which has two concentric rings of neutron detectors separated by a moderating material surrounding the well. Neutron spectroscopic in formation derived by the two rings of detectors is used to measure the quantity of ²³⁹Pu and ²⁴⁰Pu in device which corrects for background radiation, deadtime losses of the detector and electronics and various other constants of the system.
