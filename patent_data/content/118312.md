# CURABLE POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Polymers having 1,4 diketo functionalities and a car bonyl group concentration of at least 5 of polymer weight can be conveniently cured by heating with a primary diamine or its precursor and a catalytic amount of an acid having a pKa of at most about 3. Cured polymers have good physical properties and are suitable in such applications as, for example hose, tubing, wire coatings, gaskets, and seals.
