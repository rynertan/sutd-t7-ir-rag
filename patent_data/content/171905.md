# Liquid cooled cover for electric arc furnace.

## Abstract
A liquid, such as water, cooled roof or cover for an electric arc furnace is made up of a multiplicity of water cooled panels ,16, surrounded by a water distribution and collecting ring 12 , with each portion of the cover being insulated from each other portion, including the roof panel 46 , support arms 56 and the roof rack 40 . The invention provides a mens for interrupting the flow of an inductive current around each electrode 34A, , by creating a gap in the metal surrounding each electrode, thus insulating the furance roof or cover from each phase of the three phase current.
