# TRANSITION METAL BIMETALLIC CLUSTERS OF RUTHENIUM WITH THALLIUM, INDIUM AND GALLIUM

## Abstract
Novel bimetallic cluster compounds of the formula M n Ru₆C CO ₁₆ ₂ L where M is a cation, L is TI, In or Ga, and n is a number which satisfies valence requirements. These compounds are useful as homogeneous an heterogenous catalysts for converting synthesis gas to organic compounds.
