# Process for the regiospecific synthesis of anthracyclinone compounds such as daunomycinone.

## Abstract
A regiospecific synthesis for anthracyclinones asymmet ric is disclosed. The synthesis is based upon a regiospecific bromination of the C 7 position of the α tetralone which after transposing the keto group to the β position and reaction with an organo lithium compound is condensed with a phthalate ester.
