# TOP ENTRY BALL VALVE

## Abstract
A top entry ball valve comprises a plug element having two curved slides and two inclined flat sides which contain the ball and two seats. A pair of cheek elements each having one curved side and one inclined flat side are disposed on either side of the plug element with the inclined flat side of each cheek element in contact with the inclined flat sides of the plug element. The valve body includes a cylindrical bore which is dimensioned to receive the plug element and the cheek elements, and which has an axis which is perpendicu lar to the axis of the inlet and outlet ports of the valve. The plug element is biased into the cylindrical bore, whereby the inclined sides of the plug element act against the inclined sides of the cheek elements to produce an axial force on the seats and the ball to form a leak proof valve assembly.
