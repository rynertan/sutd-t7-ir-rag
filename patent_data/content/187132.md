# Dimerization process improvements.

## Abstract
Acrylonitrile is catalytically dimerized in the presence of an organic phosphorus III catalyst, an inert hydrocarbon reaction solvent and a non interfering proton donating sol vent and the dimerized product is there to separate it from the catalyst by extraction. In the extraction the dimerized product is dissolved in an extraction solvent which dissolves the catalyst and reaction solvent minimally and most of the dimerized product is removed from the catalyst while in such dissolved state, preferably by phase preparation. In the in stant invention, the extraction solvent is an amide, preferably formamide.

## Description
DIMERIZATION PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A. Field of the Invention This invention relates to dimerization process improvements and especially to improvements in a process for the dimerization of acrylonitrile to linear C6 dinitriles. B. Background of the Invention. Processes for the dimerization of acrylonitrile to essentially straight chain C6 dimers are well known in the prior art as illustrated by U.S. 4,102,915, U.S. 4,126,632 and U.S.4,138,428. Generally speaking, these patents describe processes in which acrylonitrile is contacted with an organic phosphorus III compound which has at least one hydrocarbyl and at least one alkoxy or cycloalkoxy group attached to the phosphorus atom or atoms, the acrylonitrile being dissolved in an organic solvent capable of donating protons. According to most of these teachings, the phosphorus III compound has any one of the following formulae EMI1.1 where Ar is an aromatic nucleus, e.g. phenyl or naphthyl, and where groups X, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen or electron donating substituents of the aromatic nucleus which give rise to a negative Hammett a constant and R represents an alkyl or cycloalkyl group. Substituents X may be in the para or meta positions but are preferably para. In the case of compounds of formula ii above, substituents X may be para in one Ar group but meta in the other. It will be appreciated that the phosphorus III compounds defined above are either phosphinites or phosphonites. A discussion on Hammett a constants and a table showing values for most common substituents is to be found in an article by Clark and Perrin in Quarterly Reviews, Vol 18, 1964 pp 295 320. Examples of suitable substituents X include alkoxy groups, e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, i propoxy and t butoxy alkyl groups, e.g. methyl, ethyl and propyl and alkyl amino groups, e.g. dimethylamino and diethylamino. The alkoxy, alkyl and alkylamino groups preferably contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. It is essential that group X should be one which does not react adversely with the components of the reaction system. Suitable R groups include alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, neopentyl, 2 ethylhexyl and cycloalkyl groups such as cyclohexyl. It is noted that bulky groups R, for example isopropyl, may give rise to increased catalyst lifetime. In accordance with these teachings, the presence of an organic solvent is essential to the process because in the absence of such a solvent rapid polymerization occurs. These solvents are said to be proton donating solvents1 which are substantially unreactive in respect of addition to, or reaction with, the unsaturated linkage of the acrylonitrile cr the products of acrylonitrile dimerization. It is taught that the solvent must not react with the phosphorus compounds or catalytic intermediates to form inactive phosphorus species at such a rate as to seriously impair the dimerization reaction. While the proton donating solvents were not limited to alcohols, alcohols were strongly preferred because they did not react adversely with the phosphorus compound or any intermediates the phosphorus compound may form with the acrylonitrile. Tertiary and secondary alcohols were preferred as for example, t butylalcohol, 2 butanol and isopropanol. In order to reduce the amount of heater and or other oligomers and polymers referred to as polymeric by products which were co produced with the desired dimeric products, it was considered desirable to add a non hydroxylic co solvent to the reaction mixture. These non hydroxylic organic solvents included hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and petroleum ethers ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile and fluorobenzenes. The hydrocarbon co solvents were generally preferred. In accordance with prior art processes, the desired products were readily separated from the reaction mixtures, for example, by fractional distillation or solvent extraction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention acrylonitrile is catalytically dimerized in the presence of an organic phosphorus III catalyst, a non interfering proton donating solvent and preferably an inert hydrocarbon reaction solvent, and the dimerized product is thereafter separated from the catalyst by extraction in which extraction the dimerized product is dissolved in the extraction solvent which dissolves the catalyst and reaction solvent minimally, and most of the dimerized product is removed from the catalyst while in such dissolved state, preferably by phase separation. In accordance with the present invention, the extraction solvent is preferably an amide of the empirical formulaEMI3.1 where R1 and R2 individually have 0 6 carbon atoms and are individually selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl, which may also be used as the proton donating solvent. In the detailed description, reference will be made to the drawing in which the figure is a process flow diagram illustrating the practice of this invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As indicated above, acrylonitrile is catalytically dimerized in the presence of an organic phosphorus III catalyst, a non interfering proton donating solvent and preferably an inert hydrocarbon reaction solvent, and the dimerized product is thereafter separated from the catalyst by extraction in which extraction the dimerized product is dissolved in the extraction solvent which dissolves the catalyst and reaction solvent minimally, and most of the dimerized product is removed from the catalyst while in such dissolved state, preferably by phase separation.As indicated above in accordance with the present invention, the extraction solvent is an amide of the empirical formula EMI4.1 where R1 and R2 individually have 0 6 carbon atoms and are individually selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl, which may also be used as the proton donating solvent. The proton donating solvent may be any of the tertiary or secondary alcohols such as t butylalcohol, 2 butanol or isopropanol which do not react adversely with the phosphorus catalyst, all as described in the prior art listed above. The proton donating solvent may also be a specific amide such as describes above as the extraction solvent. While it is not necessary that the same solvent be used as proton donating solvent and extraction solvent, it is of course convenient that they be the same because interchange of the solvent between the reaction and the extraction phases an result in desirable savings of costly raw material. Much of the following is written in contemplation of such identity of proton donating and extraction solvents. Aside from this critical difference in solvent usage, the teachings of the prior art are applicable to the process. For example, it is desirable that the reaction be conducted in the substantial absence of water. It is believed that water reacts with the catalyst in the presence of acrylonitrile and or dimeric products to give non catalytic addition compounds. Thus the acrylonitrile, the proton donating solvent and the reaction co solvent must be dried before use or the catalyst life may be reduced to a commercially unacceptable level. Acrylonitrile, which commonly contains as much as 4000 ppm of water, even after distillation, should be rigorously dried. Phenolic stabilizers, such as hydroquinone and its monoethyl ether, p methoxyphenol, which are present in acrylonitrile as ordinarily commercially supplied, should be removed, as for example, by treatment with activated alumina. Any suitable drying technique may be used, provided that the final water level is sufficiently low. For example, acrylonitrile and hydroxylic solvents may be dried by being contacted with calcium hydride or a 3A or 4A molecular sieve. The above findings contrast strongly with the teachings of the prior art which makes no mention of removal of water and or phenolic stabilizers, and in many instances advocates the addition of water and stabilizers, such as hydroquinone, to the reaction mixture.Calcium hydride is a particularly suitable drying agent, as it also reacts with phenolic stabilizers to form sparingly soluble phenetates, thus effecting their removal. Generally the concentration of acrylonitrile in the solvent or solvent mixture should range from 5 to 75 by volume.The concentration of acrylonitrile is kept as high as possible in order to optimize throughput and thus concentrations in the range of 10 to 50 by volume are generally preferred. The concentration of the phosphorus compound in the reactant mixture may be varied over a wide range, for example, from 0.005, to 15 by volume, calculated on the volume of liquid reactants but preferably the concentration is in the range 1 to 5 by volume. When present, the proportion of co solvent in the reaction mixture may be varied over wide limits. In general the ratio of proton donating solvent to co solvent is in the range 1 200 to 40 1 by volume but ratios at the lower end of the range are generally preferred. However, the final choice of solvent cosolvent ratio will depend on how it is desired to run the process and the catalyst compound used. For example, ratios in the range 1 150 to 1 10 may give rise to enhanced catalyst lifetime and increased selectivity to linear dimer, when compared with an equivalent reaction where the ratio is 1 1. Changes in the ratio of proton donating solvent cosolvent are generally reflected by changes in the amount of polymers formed and changes in the reaction rate. These changes in reaction parameters are often dependent upon the actual catalyst and solvent system chosen. The ratio of linear to branched dimers is also dependent on the solvent co solvent ratio in some instances. It is sometimes found that, as the proportion of proton donating solvent decreases, the proportion of linear dimer increases, and viceversa. The reaction temperature is commonly in the range 0 to 1800C. but it may be preferred to keep the range temperature below 75 C. to minimize undesirable side reactions. It is noted that the reaction will proceed below 0 C., maintaining selectivi ty, but at a reduced rate. In fact, in some cases improved selectivity may be obtained at lower temperatures. The reaction may be carried out batchwise or continuous ly. In the latter case, it may be convenient to support the catalyst compound or to use a polymeric trivalent phosphorus compound to enable the reaction to be carried out in the liquid phase using a heterogeneous catalyst. The dimeric products of our invention are predominantly linear C6 dinitriles, especially the 1,4 dicyanobutenes. Selec tivities 90 wt z calculated on total dimeric product may be readily obtained.

The light phase from the reactor is pumped through a heat exchanger, to remove the heat of reaction, back to the reactor. Formamide, either fresh, recycle or heavy phase from one of the other reactors, is mixed with the light phase and the two phases allowed to separate in the reactor, or a separate settling vessel.The dicyanobutene DCB product concentrates in the formamide layer and is pumped forward to the next stage reactor or product separator. The formamide layer, rich in DCB product leaving the reactor, is contacted with catalyst free recycle and makeup toluene and acrylonitrile to remove residual catalyst from the formamide layer. The light phase is returned to the reactor and the heavy phase is pumped to a low boiler removal column. The overhead from the low boiler removal column is mixed with makeup toluene and acrylonitrile and used for removal of the residual catalyst from the formamide layer from the last stage or product separator. The tails from the low boiler removal column are sent to a hydrogenation step to convert DCB to adiponitrile.The formamide is separated from the adiponitrile by distillation with the formamide being recycled to the first reactor and the adiponitrile is taken forward as product.

EXAMPLES 26 34 showing the use of formamide as an extraction solvent where the extraction solvent is not the proton donating solvent in the reaction In the following examples, the reactor effluents were simulated in the sense that they were formulated based upon typical reactor effluents in which isopropyl alcohol was used as the proton donating solvent, as in the prior examples.
