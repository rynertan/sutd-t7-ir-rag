# FRICTION DRIVE OF TAPE RECORDERS.

## Abstract
A friction drive device for a capstan of a tape recorder has a capstan 4 and a friction wheel 8 for transmitting rotational force when in contact with a flywheel 9 , to which the capstan 4 is attached. It also comprises a support mechanism 6 , 33 , 43 , 44 for rotatably supporting the friction wheel 8 about a pivot 61 displaced from the rotational shaft 7 of the friction wheel 8 as a center, and energizing means 67 for rotatably energizing the friction wheel 8 about the pivot 61 as a center in the direction in which it contacts the flywheel 9 , thereby providing an initial contact pressure between the friction wheel 8 and the flywheel 9 , and also using the reaction at the contact surface due to the rotation of the friction wheel 8 in the direction of rotation of the friction wheel 8 in the same direction as the energizing means 67 to increase the con tact pressure between the friction wheel 8 and the flywheel 9 to more than the initial contact pressure when the friction wheel 8 starts to rotate. The mechanism 6 , 33 , 43 , 44 is constructed so as to rotatably support a motor 5 by a pair of support members 35 , 61 at the front and rear of the motor 5 , thereby supporting the friction wheel 8 mounted on the rotational shaft 7 of the motor 5 , and the members 35 , 61 are disposed at positions symmetrically displaced along the rotational shaft 7 of the motor 5 in such a manner that the straight line between the members 35 and 61 passes through the centroid of the motor 5 , and the motor 5 can not rotate by its own weight about the mem bers 35 , 61 as a center.
