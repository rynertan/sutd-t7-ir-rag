# Weft insertion control method and device for carrying out the same.

## Abstract
A weft insertion control method for controlling the operation of a weft inserting device 100 which measures and reserves a weft 7 by winding the weft 7 on a stationary measuring and reserving drum 3 by means of a rotary yarn guide 2 , releases the weft 7 from and detains the same on the measuring and reserving drum 3 by reciprocating a detaining pin 4 relative to the measuring and reserving drum 3 , and picks the weft 7 wound and reserved on the measuring and reserving drum 3 by a picking nozzle 5 , characterized in comprising a detaining pin driving process in which a present weft releasing angle ϑ₁ and a reference weft detaining angle ϑ₂ are compared with the phase angle ϑ of the loom, the detaining pin 4 is retracted at the weft releasing angle ϑ₁ to separate the detaining pin from the circumgerance of the measuring and reserving drum 3 and the detaining pin 4 is advanced at the reference weft detaining angle ϑ₂ to bring the detaining pin 4 into abutment with the circumference of the measur ing and reserving drum a detecting process in which the number of winds of the weft 7 unwound from the measuring and reserving drum 3 is detected a comparing process in which the phase angle where the last wind of the weft 7 is unwound from the measuring and reserving drum 3 is compared with the reference weft detaining angle ₂ to obtain the time difference Δϑ therebetween and a correct ing process in which the reference weft detaining angle ϑ₂ is corrected on the basis of the time difference Δϑ obtained in the comparing process so that the time difference Δϑ is reduced to zero. According to the present invention, there are following advantages The detaining timing of the detaining pin is corrected automatically according to the actual weft inserting speed. Consequently, stable weft measuring and reversing operation is achieved and the insertion of the weft having incorrect length is prevented. The malfunction of the control system is prevented surely to achieve stable control functions since the false signal provided by the optical sensor through malfunction is ignored as invalid. When the weft inserting speed approaches the limit of the control range, an alarm signal is produced, if necessary, to notify the abnormal condition and the weft inserting speed is adjusted to a target speed by the weft inserting speed control means to achieve further stable control of the weft inserting operation.
