# A process for the removal of cumene from a gaseous stream.

## Abstract
In a process for removing cumene vapor from a gaseous stream containing it the stream is contacted with hydrophobic, macroreticular, water insoluble, crosslinked polymer comprising 20 to 100 by weight of the polymer, of divinylbenzene units, the balance if any being ethylvinylbenzene and or styrene units, neither individually being present in an amount of more than 50 by weight. Thereafter, the cumene is desorbed from the polymer by a process which involves passing steam into contact with the polymer which is thus regenerated and the cumene can be recovered from the regenerant. Although the polymer, which is usually in bead form in a bed, must be substantially dry, i.e. contain no more than 25 by weight of water based on polymer plus water, before its first contact with the cumene containing gases there is no need to subject the polymer to an intermediate drying step before having been regenerated, it is re used to absorb more cumene.
