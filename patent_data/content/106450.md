# Improvements in and relating to a high solids material heater.

## Abstract
A heater is described for use in heating material having solids content of forty percent or greater by weight or volume. The heater 10 has a central, generally cylindrical, core 15 having a spiral channel formed in the surface. The channel 14 is further divided into parallel passages 15,17 having substantially identical cross section. An input plenum 18 and output plenum 19 are provided at either ends of the channel in the core so that high solids material may pass through the core into the channel where heat is transferred and exits the outlet plenum.
