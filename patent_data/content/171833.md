# Passive display device.

## Abstract
A passive display device comprises a first supporting plate 10 and a second supporting plate 11 at least one of which is transparent. The device comprises display elements each having at least one fixed electrode 12, 13 and an electrode 16 which is arranged so as to be movable with respect to the said electrode 12, 13 and has apertures. The movable electrode 16 can be moved by electrostatic forces between two final positions determined by engaging sur faces 14, 15 . In each of the final positions the movable electrode 16 engages an engaging surface 14, 15 whose surface structure is not congruent with that of the surface of the electrode so that a finite number of discrete engaging points is formed between the movable electrode and its engaging surfaces. Furthermore methods are described for manufacturing such a display device.
