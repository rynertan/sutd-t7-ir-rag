# Resonator type bandpass filter.

## Abstract
The bandpass filter comprises line means 14, 15 extending from an input terminal 16 to an output terminal 17 and three stubs 11 to 13 respectively connected to said line means 14, 15 at three different locations a, b, a of said line at a spacing which is 1 8 the wavelength of the center frequency of the passband. Each of said three stubs 11 to 13 is short circuited at a first end and open at a second end and has a total length which is 1 4 the wavelength of said center frequency. The outermost stubs 11, 13 of said three stubs are connected to said transmis sion line means 14, 15 each at a position a, a thereof which is 1 6 the wavelength from said first end. The inter mediate stub 12 of said three stubs is connected to said line means at a position thereof b which is one of 1 8 and 1 4 the wavelength of said center frequency. This bandpass filter has an improved stop or rejection characteristic against double and treble waves of its passband.
