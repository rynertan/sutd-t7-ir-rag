# Flexible insulation for filamentary intermetallic superconductor wire.

## Abstract
A method of coating products such as metallic coil formers and wire containing the components of an interme tallic superconductive compound in which tne coating is flexible at room temperatures but which has good insulating properties after heat treatment, the coating comprising a mixture of sodium silicate, chalk and China clay which reacts on heat treatment to form an insulating ceramic but which is flexible when merely dried
