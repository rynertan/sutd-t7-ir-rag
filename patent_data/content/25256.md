# Filtration of a coal liquid slurry using polyisobutylene and an alcohol.

## Abstract
The rate of filtration of a coal liquid slurry is increased by adding polyisobutylene and an alcohol containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms to the slurry prior to filtration or by adding the alcohol to the slurry and washing a precoat cake of filter aid with an oil solution of polyisobutylene prior to filtration. Although the polyisobutylene and the alcohol each provides a filtration rate improving effect when used alone, a synergistic improvement in filtration rate is achieved by their combined use.
