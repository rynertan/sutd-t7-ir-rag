# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO CHARGE STORAGE AND TRANSFER DEVICES AND THEIR FABRICATION

## Abstract
A charge transfer device and a method of making the same, the device including an active layer of semiconductor material providing charge transfer channel means and sup ported on a support substrate, a lower array of gate electrodes for sampling or controlling charge transfer within the transfer channel means, lower pulse receiver conductors associated with the lower gate electrodes for reception of phase clocking pulses, the lower gate electrodes being disposed between the support substrate and the active layer. The method includes the steps of forming an active layer of semiconductor material on the surface of a temporary substrate, forming an array of lower gate electrodes over the surface of the active layer, ap plying a support substrate to the surface of the active layer carrying the lower electrode array, and removing the tempo rary substrate. An upper array of gate electrodes may be formed on the surface of the active layer revealed by removing the temporary substrate and a double channel structure may be formed by having an active layer comprising a plurality of semiconductor layers.
