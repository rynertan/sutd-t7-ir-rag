# Complementary pole coupling magnetic head structure.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improved generic form of magnetic read head design for reading the vertical com ponent of magnetization from a recorded magnetic medium, where data is written in the form of magnetic polarity rever sals or transitions. It utilizes the principle of coupling of complementary magnetic poles from the medium to the sensor to improve the magnitude of magnetic field ex perienced by the sensor. Two coupling legs 1, 2 are arranged in vertical relationship to the recording medium. The legs are relatively widely spaced apart to have their ends proximate to complementary magnetic pole transitions on the medium for a given density of data expressed as flux changes per inch . The other ends of the coupling legs are brought close together to direct the coupled field from the medium through a narrow gap in which a magnetic sensor is located. The coupling legs in the magnetic sensor are oriented relative to one another within this gap area so that the magnetic flux field passes through the most sensitive plane of the sensor
