# Recombinant DNA, hosts transformed with it and polypeptides produced by the hosts processes for their preparation detection processes using the polypeptides compositions and means containing the polypeptides DNA sequences.

## Abstract
Recombinant DNA molecules and hosts transformed with them which produce polypeptides displaying HBV antigenicity and genes coding therefor and method of making and using these molecules, hosts, genes and polypeptides. The recombi nant DNA molecules of this invention are characterized by structural genes that code for at least one polypeptide display ing HBV antigenicity. In appropriate hosts these recombinant DNA molecules permit the production and identification of genes and polypeptides characteristic of HBV antigenicity and their use in compositions and methods for detecting HBV virus infections in humans and stimulating the production of antibo dies against this infection.
