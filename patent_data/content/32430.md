# Apparatus for applying liquid chemicals to a moving web.

## Abstract
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a manifold in the form of a pipe 10 having a closed end is utilized to supply a finishing agent to orifices 12 arranged at spaced intervals along the pipe. A foam material 16 surrounds the manifold to receive the finishing agent and to apply it in a thin film 22 to the curved surface of an element 18 com prising a longitudinal section of a cylinder. The film is retained on the curved surface by surface tension as it moves under the force of gravity to a longitudinal edge of the cylin drical section. A web of fabric 26 is tensioned against the section edge as the fabric moves past the cylindrical section. The direction of fabric movement is such that the film of finishing agent is applied to the fabric immediately ahead of the line of contact between the fabric and the section edge.
