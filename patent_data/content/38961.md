# Temperature control for dry SO2 scrubbing system.

## Abstract
The temperature of the flue gas entering a spray dryer SO₂ absorption chamber 26 is increased so as to maintain the temperature of the flue gas leaving the spray dryer SO₂ absorption chamber 26 at a preselected temperature above the adiabatic saturation temperature of the flue gas so as to permit greater amounts of sulfur oxide absorbent slurry 36 to be sprayed into the flue gas, thereby allowing the treatment of flue gas containing high levels of sulfur oxide.
