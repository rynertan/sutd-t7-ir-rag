## Description
Description of the invention entitled nProsthesis for limbs .this inventions concerns a prosthesis for 2 limbs, namely a device suitable for replacing joints which have ceased to function. Said invention concerns particularly a prosthe sis for limbs which can be applied not only to the joints of the knee or the joints of the hip but which can also be used in treatment vf other joints by prosthesis and in the repair and restoration of said other joints. Treatment by prosthesis, namely the replacement and repair of joints which are not functioning Dell, has eisted for many years.The first prosthesis operations for the hip were carried out in 1951 by Mckee and thereafter by .Charne3y they used a cement as a means for fix ture of the osseous part to the actual prosthesis ifself. The cement used was methyl methacrylate and was prepared and used for the first time by Ohorohm in I90I. The good results obtained were soon known all over the world and so treatment of the hip by pros thesis spread quickly and is apply i nowadays in a very great number of orthopaedic centres. This discovery has enabled many persons suffer ing from arthritis of the hip or affected by fract res of the neck of the femur to recover the motory activites of the limbs in question quickly and normally. The problems visualized are of two types one se of problem concerns infections, whereas the type is connected with aseptic detachement of prosthesis caused by microfractures in the cem s r o or by the ageing of the latter. Irthermore, there is the problem of removal or placement of the prosthesis for the hip or knee, t e years after it has been applied, owing to the z polymerization of the cement, which has been re to Q slime by the time it reaches the opera e. The problem of materials has 5een so fully stu nd investigated that nowodays almost the best possible type of material has been found for use in prosthesis, whether said material be a metal or plastic or ceramic, on the basis of ezamination of the wear properties of said materials and their ability to be tolerated by the human body. ot miny years after treatment of the hip by prosthesis had begun, ezperiments were also made with treatment of the knee by prosthesis and there after of other joints as well. The first real prosthesis operations for the knee were carried out by Faldius in 1957, and these were followed by prostheses applied by so many other specialists in this field that nowadays ere are commercially available about 450 kinds of prosthesis for the knee Bulletin Wo.8 of Bawmedica . So great a number of prostheses for the ee, whether of a hinge type or articulated pe or slid ing tuper tuo compartmental type, meansthat an d ed prosthesis for the delicate knee joint in the r unan body has still not been realized. This is so because Of the compler anato ical functional structure of the knee hut, ever zore so, because, to fix the prosthesis thereof or, f desir ed, of other joints too, it is necessary use the aforesaid cement, which itself is precisely the painful part of all prostheses and, particularly so, of prostheses of the knee and hip. A report was made in specialized literature on an ezperimental study conducted in 1976 regarding a prosthesis of the femur done by removing the head thereof but leaving the great trochanter and a big part of the trochanteric fossa. This eperiment, which was not followed by others, visualized the prosthesis of a hip with a device screwed into the compact tissue of the tract joint inc the epiphysis to the diaphysis. Such a device involves many drawbacks both during an operation for prosthesis and also thereafter. X first drawback is the accuracy needed in removing the head of the femur. X second drnwback lies in the fact that the prosthesis device consists of several elements hinged together and envisages the element constituting the head of the femur as also being partially the lesser trochanter. A further drawback is the need to make a hole much longer than is strictly necessary both so as to allow the blood to collect without being com pressed so as to avcid the dancer of an embolism and also because of the length reouired for the element being screwed in. Yet another drawback lies in the fact that the actual fixture of the threaded edge of the device to the compact tissue takes place in a position too .greatly displaced towards the diaphysis, thereby creating concentrated and misali ned strains this shortcoming leads to a lesser resistance to the stresses which the limb will have to undergo. Another drawback is the mechanical and non ana tomical solution of the problem. A drawback also lies in the inability to have amicrometric adjustment of the element being screwed in. A further drawback is the pocke at of compressed and obstructed blood which forms below the element being screwed ani between said efenant and the medulary material. Another drawback is the possibility that the elementthus screwed will become unserewed.A jurther drawbcck is the possi ility that the connecting pin will become loose cw ill move if the coupling is made very precisely, such a movement will prove to be an insupercple difflicul ty during installction of the pin itself.Another drawback is the possibility that the com ponents may rotate reciprocally and that the element to reproduce the head of the femur may rotate in re relation to the bone under conditions of tensile load. There is also a prosthesis for the hip whereby the inserted socket within which the head of the femur is lodged is screwed into the bone. This partial solution to the problem in the form .in which it has been realized and envisaged cannot .be used for long bones and at the same time raises many problems too as regards anchorage in the hip, as all specialists are well aware.. All these drawbacks and shortcomings which characterize the prostheses eristing today have led in vendors to investigate and try new and more anatom ical solutions which are easier and safer to instal and which involve lesser risks and disadvantages. The invention set forth here meets the most e acting principles of biomechanics in the field of treatment by prosthesis and leads to the follorina advantages . quick and ready application and positioning . solid fixture in the bone without any cement in a position near to the epiphysis . a mechanically stable and easily positioned iJ . ture of the components to each other . minimal resection of bone . the ability to make possible interchanges of the. articular portions quick ability to move the limb and an early accep tance of tensile loads after the operation. Moreover, the invention is suitable for the re .pair of fractures and for a good outcome thereof. The invention which comprises these advantages .s realized by using a sleeve insert consisting of. a hollow tubular element having a lengthwise section like a slightly truncated cone, being substantially circular and advantaceously being threadederternally, with possible particl removals of the threads .so as to prevent unscrewing and to ae self threcd .ing possible, whereby said sleeve insert comprises at least one fitted seating and an arial hole which advantageously passes throuph it and whereby the itted seating is able so cooperate with the axial. At z position coinciding with its greatest sect .ion said sleeve insert comprise some means to apply the necessary screwing force and to act as a reference point for its positioning. The conformation of the threads is such as to permit natural develop ent of the bone around the device after the operation. According to one variant said perforated hollow tubular element or sleeve insert may have a circu .lar section according to another variant the out side of the perforated hollow tubular element, . whether the latter be axially a truncated cone or a cylinder, can be advantageously formed with lengthwise or circumferential protrusions so as to . be of a type which can be inserted by means of com .pression. According to a further variant said hollow . tubular element will have a section consisting of . two or more lobes. The shape of the fitted seating and its position within the sleeve insert determine the use of the sleeve insert itself. And so we can use the sleeve insert in two dis tinct ways, namely for prosthesis of the knee or other bones which are substantially coaxial, or .else for prosthesis of the hip or other bones which . are substantially incident.. Depending on the use to which the invention is to be put, the latter is completed with one or more parts which constitute one integrating and irrepla ceable piece together with the sleeve insert itself. Let us now look at the two specific uses individ the case of prosthesis of th t .ed searing is substantially coaxial with the leeve insert and may have an advantageously taperad lengthwise section. According to a variant the fitted seating present inside and on the aafs of he sleeve insert can also be cylindrical. Another variant is that the fitted seating, whether cylindrical or tapered, comprisés lengthwise ridges, for instance, of the type called knurled edges . In the case of application to a knee the second element, which constitutes the actual prosthesis itself, tends advantageously to invest a very restricted zone relative to the articular cartilage. Said second element comprises anchorage means for introduction into the fitted seating of the sleeve insert and, advantageously, peripheral and or frontal fixture means in the resected bone,whereby the anchorage means to be introduced are advantapeously equipped with acid outlets. Said axial outlets may consist of holes or of peripheral grooves of a lengthwise or spiral type and serve to bvate ercessive pressuresin the lower part of the sleeve insert, for said lower part lesed when the second elsment has The pro nesis er the k ee is applied by reseor ing. across the aris of the diaphysis, only the end part of the articular cartilage and perforating the. tissue suitably on the Same axis as the diaphysis until the compact tissue of the neck joining the epiphysis to the diaphysis has been reached. Next, the sleeve insert is screwed in or intro duced and centres itself in the diaphysis, which has a compact outer tissue that assists this action. Since the sleeve insert is perforated, when it .ras been screwed or inserted into its position it does not include chambers below itself to compress. the blood and In this way the danger of a fatty em bolism or any other type of embolism is obviated. The sleeve insert can be adjusted micrometically, its position as regards the prosthesis being of no. importance in respect of the perfect positioning of the prosthesis itself in relation to the bone. The next phase is the insertion of the element to anchor the prosthesis In the calibrated seating of the sleeve insert at the same time the prosthests Is positioned in relation to the joint. Mutual fixture between the sleeve insert and the prosthesis can be brought about by simple pressure, as tares place in Morse tapered couplings in machine is. Mutual anchorage can also take place by means of expansion. As said earlier, the element for anchorage of the prosthesis comprises some axially extending peripheral grooves that enable the blood to flow freely from beneath the prosthesis without any com pression and without generating any risk of fatty embolism or any other type of embolism. The anchorage element can bear at its end the prosthesis already formed or can have a seating where onto the prosthesis is installed. The anchor age element can also comDrise frontal anchorage means for the prosthesis in respect of the resected area of the bone. Where there is a prosthesis of the hip, the fit ted seating is positioned advantageously on an axis crossing the axis of the sleeve insert so as to realize an anatomical prosthesis. The invention tends to avoid a traumatic applic ation of substitutes for the hip joint and tends at the same time to avoid risks of fatty embolisms and also dangers due to a long and substantially im mobile stay in hospital. In cooperation with the sleeve insert and the .fitted seating present therein, this invention foresees positionable means which function like the head of the femur and which cooperate with socket type means of a known kind to restore in the hip the seating for a natural lodging of the head of the femur. According to the nvention, the upper part of the femur near the great trochanter is resected belong X plane substantially at right angles to the axis of .scid femur. After the above has been carried out, an insertion hole is made which cooperates with the intermediate and medullary zone of the upper part of the femur. .the axes of which coincide substantially. Into this hole is screwed or introduced by press ure a hollow tubular piece or sleeve insert which has suitable characteristics. As the hollow tubular piece or sleeve insert is empty axially, no action to create pressure on the. blood takes place during said introduction inasmuch as the blood can flow away freely in this way the dangers of an embolism of any type are eliminated In the case of a prosthesis for the hip the sleeve insert has its fitted seating in an intermediate and incident position, said fitted seating consisting of a crosswise hole inclined In relation to the axts of the sleeve Insert. Said crosswise hole may be smooth or threaded or may include a plurality of lengthwise ridges or grooves. When the sleeve insert Is screwed in or intro duced, said hole is caused to lie in an anatomical position coordinated with the axis of the neck of the femur and with the axis of the head of the fem r. By using the orientation notch positioned at the top of the sleeve insert and required for the screwed ing action also, a device for controlling and direct ing assembly in an anatomical manner can be position ed in relation to the direction of ascent of the fitted seating. Said device enables the sleeve insert to be pos itioned accurately in relation to the head of the femur and makes it possible for this action to be carried out easily and very precisely. As soon as the sleeve insert has been positioned correctly in relation to the head of the femur and the controlling and directing device has been ln stalled on the sleeve Insert itself, the neck of the femur is resected in the proper position and an inclined hole is made which passes through the re mainder of the neck of the femur. This inclined hole cooperates with said fitted seating located tn an incident manner and in an intermediate position in the sleeve Insert Into said fitted seating, which in our example is an inclined hole, an element is screwed or introduced which possesses at one end an anatomical re production of the head of the femur and at its other end a rod said element also advantageously comprises an intermediate supporting surface chat is advantage ously at right angles to the axis of the rod. Said rod is able to cooperate with the incident . fitted seating located in the sleeve insert and ca n be at least partially threaded or can include some circumferential or axial channels cooperating or not with at least one threaded part. The supporting surface has the task of positioning the rod advantageously against the frontal re sected zone of the neck of the femur. In this way the bone of the femur cooperates with the mechanical ,means for their reciprocal fixture and position and is reinforced by said means at the same time. If the rod and the incident seating are threaded , .there is a risk of excessive compression on the neck of the femur if there should be any mistake in the setting up process. To prevent this it is best that the rod should h ve a threaded terminal zone which cooperates 3 M the peripheral part of the body of the femur so rnat any mistakes made by the person carrying out the operation will not lead to compression of the neck of the femur, and the outer part of the femur Dill only be skimmed, this in itself being only a very slight damage which will soon be repaired with tSe regeneration of the bony tissue. Owing to this invention traumatic lesions in the femur and hip are almost non existent, the dangers of an embolism have practically disappeared and a patient can quickly take up a motory position again, seeing that between the bone and the mechanical means an intimate and strong union of a clearly anatomical nature is realized even during the oper ration itself. The invention, therefore, consists of a prosthe sis for limbs which is suitable for the treatment by prosthesis of the knee, hip and other incident or coaxial joints or else for the treatment of bone fractures and which is characterized by comprising .in mutual cooperation and coordination . an axially bored tubular element or sleeve insert which includes a fitted seating and, at its front, means to apply inserting force, na a prosthesis element which can be positioned in said fitted seating, . wherey there may be some possible auxiliary pros .. thesis means and whereby means will advantageously be included to fix the hollow tubular element to the prosthesis element. Let us now use the attached tables, which show as examples soa prostheses for limbs according to preferential but not restrictive solutions of the invention. so as to make more evIdent the idea of the solution of the invention itself.

LS generically tie means equipped to provide anatom Ical control and posftioninp and serves to position and orient the sleeve insert exactly and to ensure accurate removal of the neck of the femur and axial perforation of the neck of the femur itself 61 is the positioning and orienting body in our example . ot comprises both the pin 161 cooperating with the acial bore 54 of the sleeve insert 125 and also blade type protrusions 261 that cooperate with the notches 28 so as to orient and position the means 6Q accurately in relation to the direction of ascent and axis of the bore 127 62 is the connecting fin 63 is the shaped piece which reproduces partially with its upper part 64 the head of the femur and provides the preferential line for resecting 122 the neck of the femur 65 is a hollow tubular piece which can be axially stationary or movable, pre inclined and pre positioned according to the axis of the bore 127 so that, when the means 60 is positioned aboue the sleeve insert 125 and the Åalade type protrusions 161 are cooperating with the notches 28, the axis of the hollow tubular element 65 lies on the axis of the fitted seating I27 165 is the stationary .hollow tubular piece with a slit, within which the.possibly movable tubular piece 65 can run or be fixed as desired the stationary tubular piece 165 is rig idly connected to and pre positioned in relation to the positioning body 61 by means of the connecting. in 62 the staggering of the Individual parts so as to make the axis of the tubular piece 65 mate with the axis of the seating 127 is a part of normal design technt ques so s a possible fixture means kich. by coopernting with the slit 166. serves to in in the desired position the possible movable t l tubular piece 65 67 is indicatively the cutting instrument which serves to resect the neck of the femur in the correct position in relation to the sleeve insert 125 and has he preferential cutting line 122 as a guide 68 is the irilling means which, cooperat in with the guide consisting of the hollow tubular DtCe 5, perforntes the tissue of the neck of the femur in axial cooperation with the fitted seating .i 2 and thereafter having passed beyond the fitted seating 12 , may perhaps also perforate the compact tissue lying beyond the sleeve insert 125 the dri ll ing instrument 68 obviously has an outer diameter that cooperates with the seating 127 and with the dimens of the stem 58. As said earlier, the fitted seatings 27 and 127 can be tapered or cylindrical, smooth, knurled or threaded, axially er ctrcumferentially, depending on the use to which t they are to be put. If the fitted seatinas 27 and 127 are tapered, .the anchorage means 31 and 58 will be tapered and will behave reciprocally like a tapered mechanical coupling o,f the Morse taper type, for instance.If the fitted seating 27 is cylindrical, the an chorage means 131 and 231 can be of diverse types figures 7 and 8 give examples of two possible types. Fig. 7 shows a type wherein the effect of the scre i 40, which presses with its head into an pprop riate seating in the element 35, causes the trunca teg cone body 39 to be able to move axially, thus provoking an expansion of the wings of the anchor .age means, said wings then anchoring themselves to the walls of the fitted seating 27. Fig. 8, on the other hand, shows a rod 42 which hcs at its end the knob 43 when the rod 42 is pu .shed as far as it can go into the seating 44, the knob arrives and cooperates with the at least partially elastic element 41, causing it to expand and to anchor itself In a part of the fitted seating 27 or at the end thereof. Let us now see the method of functioning in the case of a prosthesis for the knee Figs. I to 8 inclusive . When resections have been made along the planes 21, 22 and 121, the appropr in te axial holes are then made in the femur 10 and or in the tibia II. These holes should be advantageously centred in the central zone of the narrowing of the .epiphysis or the femur IO and of the tibia II. This enables the sleeve Insert, when being screwed ed in. to centre itsef when it apbraches the tract .of the diaphysis of the long bones. Owing to the cutaway portions 29 the sleeve Insert 25 behaves like a thread forming element and at the same time brings about the reciprocal anchorage which prevents it from becoming unscrewed. The fact that the sleeveinsert 25 has an axial bore enables the blood to flow freely without the creation of counterpressures and without the con .sequent dangers of fatty embolisms or embolisms of any other type As the sleeve insert 25 is relatively long, it . is able to cooperate with the bone and creates thereon a very light specific load in the zone of .mutual contact and anchorage. At the sae time the ..anatomical position of the sleeve insert 25 in the bone is such that moments of forces unlike the nor .mal ones existing in a healthy bone are not created. Then the sleeve insert 25 has been positioned, the means 31 or 131 or 231 are then positioned in .the seating 27. Even during the positioning of the means 31, 131 or 231 in the seating 27 there is no danger of creat ing any pressure on the mass of blood flowing from. the bone this is so because of the presence of the outlet channels 32, which enable the blood to drain a cay independently. Even if the prosthesis element 30 does not come into complete contact with the resected surfaces at once, it is not very important since the bone re creates itself and arranges independently to fill . the empty spaces within a matter of some days. The presence of the rear bodies 233 prevents the prosthesis from rotating out of its position this task is also fulfilled by the pins 37, which are driven into the front part of the resection 21 121 of the epiphysis. If so wished, the prosthesis can be replaced as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In this case reciprocal positioning means 45 and means for stable reciprocal fixture 37 will be provided. Let us now see the method of functioning in the.case of a prosthesis for the hip Figs. 9 to 12 inclusive . After the upper part of the femur IO has been removed along a plane substantially at right angles to the axis of the femur itself IO and near. to the great trochanter, an axial hole may be made, but is not necessarily made, In the spongy tissue and in the medulla on the axis of the femur itself.This removal of tissue can be carried out with an . appropricte instrument. which is not shown here as it is not relevant to the purposes of the discovery. In she hole thus made the sleeve insert 125 is screwed or introduced with a suitable screwing or .thusting means ami is positioned in relation to the held 52 QT the femur IO by means of the device 60. . Then the sleeve Insert 125 has been positioned, .the neck of the famur is resected, as said ecrlier, .with t, l an appropriate instrument 67 along the cutting line 122 and a hole is made on the same axis as the fit ted seating I27. The element 51 is screwed or thrust into the hole thus made until the supporting base 152 mates with and rests against the surface .122 obtained by the resection of the neck of the femur.The element 51 is screwed or thrust, depend being on whether the fitted seating 127 is threaded or not. If the end 59 of the stem 58 is threaded, .the element 51 is thrust through the fitted seating .127 and is then screwed onto the outer bone of the femur IO. Even if this action is not carried out .very accurately, the force exerted by the threads .against the outer bone ts not such as to impare the .remainder of the tract of the neck oy the femur in a dangerous manner. We have described here some variants of the idea of the solution as applied to treatment of the knee and hip by prosthesis, but other variants are poss .ible for a specialist in this field. Thus it is poss .ible to vary the sizes and proportions and to apply the idea of the solution to treatment of the elbow and ankle, etc. by prosthesis and, to be more precise, to other joints the idea of the solution can be applied as a a whole or in part to treatment of broken .bones it is possible to use any material which may be useful for the purpose and advantageous as regards duration or compatibility with the human body it Is .possible, for instance, to use polythene, titanium, an alloy based on titanium, ceramics, very pure sin .tered corundum, etc. the surface in contact with smooth bone can be made with suitable holes or rid ges suitable for enhancing the anchorage anÅa or the growth of the bone it is possible to use any type of screw threads and to vary the conformation of the prosthesis on the basis of blomechanical experiments It is possible to foresee the sleeve insert as being knurled outside or having circumferential ridges the seatings could be knurled, etc. these and perhaps other variants are possible within the scope of the Idea of the solution.
