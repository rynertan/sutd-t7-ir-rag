# A mixer for use in a microwave system.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a mixer for use at high microwave frequencies typically 21.8 23.2 GHz in a low cost communications application. The invention utilizes low cost microwave components, including a low cost compartmented waveguide 27 , shared by the signal and local oscillator and extensive microstrip circuitry 26 . The provision of a pair of novel 1 4 wave impedance transformers 31, 32, 33, 34 coupled into the waveguide compartments provides efficient antenna and local oscillator input filtering, and efficient coupling from the waveguide sections to the microstrip circuitry. The mixer operation is carried out in the microstrip circuitry, which con tains a hybrid coupler, a balanced diode detector, and the re quired mixer output filter. The arrangement is of low cost, and provides a low noise figure 7 db including the preamplifier , good band selectivity 15 db return loss over the communica tions band , and low local oscillator radiation.
