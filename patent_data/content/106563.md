## Description
DRY SOLID MICROBIOCIDAL COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF CONTROLLING MICROORGANISMS AND OF SAFENING ISOTHIAZOLONE MICROBIOCIDES This invention is concerned with dry solid microbiocidal compositions, methods of controlling microorganisms and of safening isothiazolone microbiocides. Of special interest as the microbiocidal compounds are 3 isothiazolones and 2 substituted 1,2 benz isothiazolones hereafter isothiazolones , which have a known tendency to effect skin irritancy to man and to evolve nontoxic gases when provided in aqueous solution at concentrations convenient for shipping. The isothiazolones are a class of chemical compounds known to possess excellent and useful microbiocidal. and resistance to common additives and contÅaminants. Many 3 isothiazolones are disclosed in U. S. Patents 3,761,488 3,849,430 3,870,795 4,067,878 4 150.,026 andK 4,241,214. U.S. Patents 3,517,022 3,065,123 and 3,761,489 disclose 2 substituted 1,2 benzisothiazolones. U. S. Patent 3,849,430 discloses a method for preparing the ç isothiazolones. While these patent specifications disclose the use of isothiazolones in a variety of microbiocidal end uses such as, for example, those uses and formulations and compositions disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,761,488 at columns 15 19 and in the actual examples thereafter, isothiazolones are generally made available in combination with a liquid carrier such as water or in aqueous compositions. Column 19, line 66 et seq. discloses that isothiazolones can be taken up or mixed with a finely divided particled solid carrier, as for example, clays, inorganic silicates, carbonates, silicas and organic carriers. Column 20, line 25 et seq. discloses that a convenient method for preparing a solid formulation is to impregnate the isothiazolone toxicant onto the solid carrier by means of a volatile solvent, such as acetone.However, attempts to produce solid formulations have resulted in formulations which tended to coalesce or cakes or to give extremely lightweight particles or dusts . U. S. Patent 4,011,172 discloses chlorine bleaching compounds dissolved in water or other suitable solvent thickened by the addition of particulate thickening agent, for example, silicate materials, water swellable and water soluble polyacrylamides and cellulose derivatives, and synthetic clays, the thickened bleaching compounds being contained in a perforated pouch made of plastic material. It is also known to protract release of active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions by embedding the active ingredient in a fat, wax, lacquer, or plastic composition. U.S. Patent 3,437,728 discloses a sustained release pharmaceutical composition in which the active ingredient is embedded in, or impregnated with, paraffin and compressed with conventional adjuvants to form tablet cores. The crude cores thus obtained are coated with a protective diaphragm of talc or other acid and alkali resistant mineral materials and a mixture of paraffin and stearic acid or other higher fatty acids or with acetyl cellulose or mixture of these materials. U.S. Patent 2,887,438 discloses the preparation of sustained release pharmaceutical tablets by preparing an inner core by melting and mixing solid, high melting carriers for example, carnauba wax and stearyl alcohol , adding an active therapeutic component and dispersing it thoroughly, allowing the mixture to solidify, passing the resultant mass through a sieve, adding a lubricant, and compressing the mixture by mechanical means. The resulting granules are then coated with shellac. These granules are then mixed with portions of coating granules prepared by the fusing of the active ingredient with solid, high melting carriers, and the granular coating is compressed evenly around the core using suitable mechanical means. Isothiazolones are commonly provided in commerce in aqueous solution, usually with inorganic, alkaline earth metal salts as stabilizers to nucleophilic agents and aqueous bases, in the presence of which isothiazolones undergo a ring cleavage reaction which renders them inactive against microorganisms. Although solid alkaline earth metal salt complexes are known U. S. Patents 4,150,026 and 4,241,214 mentioned above , these salt complexes suffer the disadvantage that they badly corrode processing equipment used to remove water in the course of producing the solid dry salt complex product, and the final solid salt complex product tends to be extremely dusty and thereby irritating when handling the product. A typical, useful commercially available 3 isothiazolone product is Kathon 886 Rohm and HaasCompany , a metal salt stabilized aqueous solution of 5 chloro 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone and 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone 3 1 containing 14 active ingredient and Mg NO3 2 plus MgC12 as stabilizers.Such commercial products suffer the disadvantages of being irritating to the skin when spilled during handling and evolving nontoxic gases which build up pressure in sealed containers used in shipping and transportation. It has been found that these disadvantages can be overcome by providing water soluble microbiocidal compounds, especially 3 isothiazolones, in the form of dry solid compositions, as disclosed in our copending European PatentApplication No. filed on the seme day as the present application and claiming priority from U.S. Serial No.422498. The present invention is a further improvement to overcome these disadvantages that permits direct handling of the biocidal compositions. According to this invention an article useful in the storage, handling and transportation of microbiocidal compound and its provision at a controlled, protracted rate in a method for controlling living microorganisms in an aqueous system comprises a a particulate, solid microbiocidal composition useful in aqueous systems comprising i 0.1 70 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of a microbiocidal compound having sufficient water solubility to provide a microbiocidally effective amount thereof and ii 99.9 30 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of solid carrier material embedded in b water insoluble, high melting solid binder. The article can for example be in the form of a solid disc or plug or in the form of encapsulated, pelletized particles. The solid binder can be any conventional water insoluble, high melting solid binder material. By high melting is meant a melting point of 40 2000 C, preferably 50 125 C. Examples of suitable materials for use in or as the water insoluble, high melting solid binder component include waxes such as paraffin wax, beeswax, carnauba wax fatty acids, alcohols, and esters such as stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, and glyceryl tristearate synthetic waxes, alcohols, and esters and polymeric materials such as polyalkylene ethers, polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, and polyvinyl aromatic compounds and compatible mixtures of the foregoing. Preferably, the high melting solid binder is paraffin wax.The high melting solid binder may be used in any suitable proportion to the amount of particulate solid microbiocidal composition. A generally useful ratio of paraffin wax to microbiocidal composition is from about 1 2 to about 2 1 by weight. Preferably, in the particulate solid microbiocidal composition a , microbiocidal compound i comprises microbiocidally effective isothiazolone S represented by the formula EMI5.1 wherein Y is an unsubstituted or substituted C1 C18 alkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted C2 C18 alkenyl or alkynyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted C3 C12 cycloalkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl group of 6 10 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted or substituted aryl group of 6 10 carbon atoms R is hydrogen, halogen or a C1 C4 alkyl group R is hydrogen, halogen or a C1 C4 alkyl group or R and R can be taken together with the C C bond of the isothiazolone ring to form an unsubstituted or substituted benzene ring or said isothiazolone s stabilized with metal salt in an amount of 1 60 weight , based on weight of isothiazolone and metal salt, said metal salt s being represented by the formula MXn wherein M is a cation of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, iron, zinc, barium, manganese, silver, cobalt and or nickel X is chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, acetate, chlorate, perchlorate, bisulfate, bicarbonate, oxalate, maleate, p toluene sulfonate, carbonate, and or phosphate and n is an integer for which the anion X satisfies the valence of the cation M and said solid carrier material ii comprises inert, finely divided water insoluble solid material selected from silicaceous diatomaceous earth, high water absorption capacity calcium silicate granular material, charcoal, clays, vermiculite, corn cobs and wood. It is to be understood that, as the number of carbon atoms in the substituent group Y increases, and as halogens are substituted on the isothiazolone ring, water solubility decreases. By a substituted alkyl group is meant an alkyl group having one or more of its hydrogens replaced by another substituent group. Examples of the substituted alkyl groups which characterize the isothiazolones preferably used in this invention include hydroxyalkylv haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylaminoalkyl, carboxyalkyl, carbalkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, arylthioalkyl, haloalkoxyalkyl, cycloaminoalkyl such as morpholinylalkyl and piperidinylalkyl and pyrrolodinylalkyl and the like, carbamoxyalkyl, alkenyl, haloalkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkynyl and isothiazolonylalkyl. By a substituted aralkyl group is meant an aralkyl group having one or more of the hydrogens on either the aryl ring or the alkyl chain replaced by another substituent group. Examples of the substituted aralkyl group which characterize the isothiazolones preferably used in this invention include halo, lower i.e. C1 to C8 preferablyC1 to C4 alkyl and, lower alkoxy. By a substituted aryl group and substituted benzene ring is meant an aryl group and benzene ring, respectively, such as phenyl, naphthyl, or pyridyl groups, having one or more of the hydrogens on the aryl ring replaced by another substituent group. Examples of such substituent groups include halo, nitro, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl and acylamino, lower carbalkoxy and sulfonyl. By the expression water soluble as applied to the isothiazolones used in this invention is meant an isothiazolone or combination of isothiazolones characterized by having a water solubility of about 1000 ppm 0.1 or greater at room temperature 250C . Highly water soluble isothiazolones can have a room temperature water solubility even as high as 150,000 ppm to nearly infinitely soluble. By the expression microbiocidal compound is meant those compounds effective to control those microorganisms of the group of bacteria, fungi including molds and yeasts and algae. In the method of the invention for controlling living microorganisms, by the expression microorganisms is meant bacteria, fungi including molds and yeasts and algae. When used alone, the expression isothiazolones is meant to include the free isothiazolones and the metal salt complexes of the free isothiazolones. More preferably, the microbiocidal composition used in this invention comprises i 1 35 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of at least one water soluble isothiazolone having a water solubility of about 1000 ppm or greater wherein Y is an unsubstituted or substituted C1 Cl8 alkyl group or C3 C12 cycloalkyl group R is hydrogen or halogen R is hydrogen or halogen or R and R are taken together with the C C bond of the 3 isothiazolone ring to form a benzene ring or said 3 isothiazolone stabilized with said metal salt and ii 99 65 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of a solid carrier material selected from silicaceous diatomaceous earth, high water absorption capacity calcium silicate granular material, high purity silica e.g. Aerosil and Sipernet and clays.Most preferably, the composition of the invention comprises i 2 25 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of said isothiazolone wherein Y is methyl, R is hydrogen and R is chlorine or of a mixture of said isothiazolones in aqueous solution wherein Y is methyl, R is hydrogen and R is chlorine and Y is methyl, R is hydrogen and R is hydrogen or said isothiazolone s stabilized with said metal salt wherein said metal salt is Mg NO3 2 or a mixture of Mg NO3 2 and MgCl2 and ii 98 75 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of silicaceous diatomaceous earth. By way of example, there may be used in combination with the above defined most preferred, or more preferred, isothiazolones the isothiazolone having a water solubility of about 500 ppm wherein Y is n octyl or t octyl and R andR are both hydrogen, providing, of course, that the water solubility of the combination is 1000 ppm or greater. Another aspect of the invention is a method for controlling living microorganisms in an aqueous system which comprises incorporating into the aqueous system the article of the invention containing an amount of the composition used in the invention sufficient to provide in the aqueous system a microbiocidally effective amount of said microbiocidal compound. Yet another aspect of the invention is a method for safening microbiocidal isothiazolone compounds which comprises preparing a solid wax or wax like disc or plug containing embedded therein a particulate solid microbiocidal composition comprising a microbiocidally effective isothiazolone free isothiazolone or metal salt complex thereof and an inert, finely divided water insoluble solid carrier material.Still another aspect of the invention is a method for the controlled, protracted release of microbiocidal compounds, for example, microbiocidal isothiazolones, into an aqueous system by the steps of 1 preparing the article of the invention defined above 2 introducing the article into the aqueous system 3 permitting the aqueous system to diffuse into the article and 4 permitting the microbiocidal compound to dissolve and to be released into and diffuse through the aqueous system the rate of release of microbiocidal compound being controlled and protracted to the desired interval for release of all of the microbiocidal compound by adjusting the ratio of the surface area of the solid disc or particulate article to the volume ratio of the solid disc or particulate article combined with selecting a microbiocidal compound characterized by having a higher or lower water solubility. The preparation and properties of representative isothiazolones are described in U. S. Patents 3,517,022 3,761,488 and 3,065,123. U. S. Patent 3,849,430 further discloses a process for the preparation of representative isothiazolones. U.S. Patents 3,870,795 and 4,067,878 describe metal salt stabilized solutions of 3 isothiazolones which are useful according to this invention. Additional isothiazolones which are useful according to the invention are those disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,310,590. The finely divided water insoluble solid material can for example be selected from silicaceous diatomaceous earth, high water absorption capacity calcium silicate material, and clays. Suitable silicaceous diatomaceous earth material is described in the Johns Manville Corporation TechnicalBulletin FF 160A, 10 80 concerning Celite Diatomite FilterAids and Natural, Calcined, and Flux Calcined Grades thereof. Suitable high water absorption capacity calcium silicate material is commercially available under the trademark Micro Cel from the Johns Manville Corporation. Especially preferred is a diatomaceous earth material commercially available as Celite 545 Johns ManvilleCorporation . Of course, conventional adjuvants may be incorporated into the solid microbiocidal composition used in producing the article of this invention for example by first dissolving them in the aqueous or inert organic solvent solution of the isothiazolone s and then blending the solution with the solid carrier material. One useful additive for use in the solid microbiocidal composition is a dye which would impart a readily visible color. Thus, whenever any solid microbiocidal composition would accidently be spilled onto the skin during production of the article or whenever isothiazolone would leach out of the article, the spilled material could readily be observed and removed before the irritant could leach out of the solid and cause skin burns.This is in contrast to the case involving accidental spillage of the aqueous mirobiocidal solution of the isothiazolone when handling in association with an aqueous system in which case it would be difficult to distinguish between harmless aqueous system and irritating isothiazolone concentrate. Other useful adjuvants and additives include chelating agents, surfactants, dispersants, buffers, and the like. Alternatively, other conventional adjuvants and additives used with microbiocidal compounds, such as the isothiazolones used in this invention, may be combined with the microbiocidal composition in the high melting solid binder independent of incorporation into microbiocidal compositions. The article of the invention may be used advantageously in metal working fluids, swimming pools, water towers such as water cooling towers and toilet bowls or cisterns. The article according to the invention can afford many advantages. One obtainable advantage is that the article is a solid form of the microbiocidal composition, especially isothiazolone compositions of isothiazolones known to be skin irritants, which is more convenient for handling, transporting, and shipping. The article is, therefore, also a safer form of the microbiocidal composition, especially the isothiazolone composition, in that it obviates contact of the isothiazolone composition with the skin and the leaching out from the composition in the dry article of the isothiazolone. Another obtainable advantage is that the article may permit the use of the solid microbiocidal composition, especially the solid isothiazolone composition, in applications in which freely dispersed, finely divided solid matter could not be tolerated, for example, in water cooling towers and swimming pools and the like. For use in metal working fluids, swimming pools, water towers, such as water cooling towers, toilet bowls, washing machines, and the like, the article of the invention can conveniently be removed from its shipping container, placed into the aqueous system to be treated, and, when the microbiocidal compound has completely leached out of the article, the solid disc or particles containing the solid carrier and binder materials can be removed by conventional techniques, for example, by hand, using tongs to dip the solid disc from the aqueous system. The article of this invention may be prepared in the form of a solid disc or plug by first providing a solid microbiocidal composition of microbiocidal compound absorbed on a solid carrier. For example, an aqueous or organic solvent solution of one or more of the afore mentioned isothiazolones may be blended with Celite 545 and, when organic solvent is used, the solvent may be removed by evaporation. Then, the solid microbiocidal composition may be mixed with a water insoluble, high melting solid binder, for example, molten paraffin or other wax or granulated, particulate polymeric material, such as the crosslinked carboxyvinyl polymer disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,798,053 and the hydrophilic hydroxyalkyl meth acrylate polymers disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,577,512.Of course, the microbiocidal compound and solid carrier material need not be pre mixed but may be independently mixed with the solid binder. When molten wax, fatty acid, or polymeric material are used as the solid binder, the mixture may be cooled and the resulting solid disc may then be easily removed. The solid disc may then be added to the desired aqueous system by any suitable means. When granulated, particulate polymeric material is used as the solid binder, the uniform mixture of solid binder with microbiocidal composition may be compressed to form a solid disc using suitable, conventional means, such as those described in U.S. Patent 3,330,729. Alternatively, the article of this invention may be prepared in the form of a granular, particulate encapsulated solid or pelletized solid. The microbiocidal composition, or the components thereof, independently, may be mixed with molten binder for example, paraffin wax in conventional proportions required to obtain solid carrier and microbiocidal compound embedded in binder for example, paraffin wax in the form of a pelletized solid. See U.S.Patent 3,437,728 mentioned above. Alternatively, the solid disc of microbiocidal composition embedded in wax described above may be ground with dry ice to obtain pellets. In another alternative, a molten mixture of microbiocidal compound and solid carrier and solid binder may be extruded downward as droplets through jets and air cooled in long columns or extruded as ribbons or rods and pelletized by cutters. In still another alternative, articles according to this invention, especially the pelletized form of the articles, may be coated by conventional coating means with a thin coat of conventional coating materials such as shellac U.S. Patent 3,274,061 and modified shellac U.S. Patents 3,738,952 and 3,741,395 , cellulose derivatives U.S.Patents 3,504,082 3,282,790 and 3,741,397 , synthetic polymers U.S. Patents 3,520,970, aminoalkyl acrylates 3,143,472, half esters of maleic anhydride copolymers 3,055,433, epoxy resin coatings and 3,325,365, polyvinyl acetate coatings . The thin coating applied to the article of the invention provides a means to further control and protract the release of microbiocidal compound from the article. The pellets may be placed in the aqueous system to be treated or packaged, for example, in a flexible, water permeable membrane and the package placed in the aqueous system to be treated. The following examples illustrate some embodiments of the invention. In the Examples all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated and all temperatures are in degrees Centigrade unless otherwise indicated. Percentages of the metal salts magnesium nitrate and magnesium chloride are based on the molecular weight of the usual commercial form.Example 1 To 75 g. of Celite 545 in a glass bottle was added 75 g. of Kathon 8861. The mixture was then stirred by hand with a spatula until it appeared to be uniformly mixed and free flowing. No drying by heating was required or desired. The resulting solid product contained one half of the initial amount of active ingredient per unit weight of product, that is, the solid composition contained 7 weight of active ingredient.Example 2 A solid microbiocidal composition containing 20 weight of active ingredient was prepared by dissolving 2.66 g. of crystalline 5 chloro 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone in 15 ml. of methanol. To this solution there was added 0.6 g. of Mg NO3 2.6 H20. The resulting solution was added to 10 g. of Celite 545 in a 4 fl. oz. bottle and the mixture was stirred by hand using a spatula until it appeared to be uniformly mixed and free flowing. Methanol was removed by air drying overnight or by heating the mixture under reduced pressure , and a uniform, free flowing particulate solid was obtained.1Kathon 886 is 5 chloro 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone blended with 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone in a weight ratio of 3 1 with 15 wt. Mg NO3 2 and 9 wt. of Mac12 in aqueous solution containing 14 active ingredient, commercially available from the Rohm and Haas Company. Example 3 This example illustrates the property of the solid microbiocidal composition whereby the solid composition tends not to evolve gasses to the extent that the known aqueous solutions of 3 isothiazolones evolve gasses even after heat treatment to eliminate volatile components. The solid compositions were prepared as follows Water was partially removed from Kathon 886 aqueous concentrate under reduced pressure 650 C 40 mm Hg , and solid carrier material Celite 545, available fromJohns Manville Corporation, Attaclay X 250, available from the Minerals and Chemicals Corporation of America,Attapulgus Clay Products, HiSil T 600, available fromPittsburgh Plate and Glass Company, or mixtures thereof was added to the residue to obtain a flowable solid composition, The table below describes the formulation, and properties of representative compositions.
