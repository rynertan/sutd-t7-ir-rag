## Description
Background of the Invention Field of the Invention. The present invention pertains to an improved apparatus for removing folded newspapers traveling in shingled relation from a stream conveyor and transferring them to a gripper type conveyor. More particularly, the invention pertains to an apparatus for independent control of each newspaper by engaging the folded edge to remove it from the stream conveyor, guiding it to an elevated position and then guiding it downwardly so that its cut edge will enter into the trough or pocket of a gripper conveyor where it is held while being transferred to another location for further processing. Description of the Prior Art. A number of UnitedStates patents show and describe devices for transferring printed products such as newspapers from one conveyor to another for the purpose of additional processing and, for reference to the teachings of such disclosures, attention is hereby directed to U.S. Patents 3,955,667 and 4,039,182. Summary of the Invention The apparatus for effecting indiviudual withdrawal of folded newspapers or the like from a stream conveyor and transferring them to a gripper type conveyor according to the invention includes a supporting frame having an endless timing belt mounted for rotative movement therein. The belt is operatively connected to a pair of spaced timing pulleys with one of said pulleys being rotatably driven. The timing belt has a plurality of spaced cleat members fixed in spaced relation thereon which are caused to travel with the timing belt between positions of operative association with both the stream and gripper type conveyors. Each cleat member is adapted to engage the folded edge of a single newspaper and withdraw it from the stream conveyor.The timing belt moves upwardly with the newspapers taken from the stream conveyor with their cut edges directed forwardly or in the direction of travel. As the timing belt is guided over the upper surface of the upper timing pulley, the newspapers are then directed downwardly to a position where their cut edges enter into troughs or pockets of the gripper type conveyor. This conveyor is effective in gripping the newspapers until they reach a predetermined downstream location whereat they receive additional processing. An endless guide belt operatively associated with a plurality of idler rollers frictionally engages and guides the newspapers as they move with their respective cleat members about the upper surface of the upper timing pulley. As the newspapers move downwardly, engagement with the guide belt is removed which permits the newspapers to drop out of their respective cleat member and enter one of the pockets of the gripper conveyor. It is a general object of the invention to provide an improved apparatus for successively withdrawing single newspapers from a stream conveyor and transferring them to a gripper type conveyor. A further object is to provide an improved apparatus that will independently engage and guide each newspaper while being transferred from one form of conveyor to another. Another object is to provide an improved apparatus for transferring newspapers from one conveyor to another which is of simplified construction, having a minimum number of parts that are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and with long life expectancy. These and other objects of the invention will become more fully apparent by reference to the appended claims and as the following detailed description proceeds in reference to the figures of drawing wherein Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a newspaper assembler showing a plurality of apparatus according to the invention forming a part thereof Fig. 2 is a view in side elevation of the apparatus according to the invention Fig. 3 is a top view of the apparatus shown in Fig.2 Fig. 4 is an end view as seen looking in the direction of the indicating arrow 4 in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the apparatus shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing a portion of the opposite end of the apparatus in Fig. 5. Description of the Preferred Embodiment Referring now to Fig. 1, the various mechanisms are shown that form a newspaper assembler that is identified generally by numeral 10. This assembler includes among its several mechanisms a pair of spaced stream makers 12 and 14, a gripper conveyor 16 and conveyor loading apparatus, according to the invention, that are identified generally by numeral 18 and which will be described in greater detail hereinafter. A pocket carousel or endless conveyor with which the present invention is operatively associated is identified generally by numeral 20 and is provided with a multiplicity of po ckets of V shaped configuration that are depicted by numeral 22. The conveyor loading apparatus 18 hereinafter referred to as loader is provided with a supporting frame consisting of a pair of spaced side walls 24 and 26 mounted on a base plate 28. As shown in Fig. 3, a shaft 30 extends through aligned openings in side walls 24 and 26 and the ends thereof are journaled in bearing members 32 and 34 that are mounted on the outer sides of the walls 24 and 26, respectively. A timing pulley 36 Figs. 2 and 5 is mounted on shaft 30 intermediate the side walls 24 and 26 and is rotatably driven by any suitable means not shown . Below and spaced from the timing pulley 36, a second timing pulley 38 Figs. 2 and 6 is provided that is rotatably mounted on a bar 40 which is supported on a pair of spaced arms 42 and 44 that are carried on a support bracket 46 which is assembled on the base plate 28. As shown in Fig. 2, arm 42 is part of a bell crank lever with a downwardly directed second arm 48 that is adjustably connected to the support bracket 46 as at 50 and provides a means for selectively raising or lowering the second timing pulley 38 for reasons that will become obvious as further details of the invention are described. An endless timing belt 52 operatively interconnects the timing pulleys 36 and 38 and is caused to travel in the direction of the indicating arrows 54 shown in Figs.2 6. This timing belt 52 has a plurality of cleat members generally indicated by numeral 56 fixed on the outer surface thereof and they are disposed in evenly spaced relation about the entire outer surface. Each cleat member 56 is attached to the timing belt 52 in a manner whereby a portion thereof is disposed in spaced relation to the belt and defines a lip 58. As the cleat members move with the timing belt 52 about the outer surface of the timing pulley 38, they are caused to intercept a lapped stream of folded newspapers 60 being advanced by any suitable conveying apparatus, such as an endless wire type, a portion of which is shown at 62 inFig. 2. The lips 58 of each cleat member 56 are effective in engaging the folded edge of a newspaper and move the same in the direction of the indicating arrow 54 shown in Fig.2. As the newspapers move with their respective cleat members on the timing belt 52, the sides of the newspapers are supported by arcuated plate members 64 and 66. These arcuated plate members 64 and 66 extend along the sides of the endless belt 52 within the side walls 24 and 26 for a distance which places one of their ends in operative association with the endless wire type conveyor 62 and the opposite ends in association with a gripper type conveyor identified generally by numeral 68 in Fig.2. To maintain the newspapers in alignment as they are taken and advanced by the cleat members 56, a pair of arcuated guide fences 70 and 72 are provided which are disposed in continguous relation with the outer edges of the arcuated plate members 64 and 56, respectively. To prevent displacement of the newspapers from the lips 58 of their respective cleat members 56 while being advanced to the gripper type conveyor 68, a guide belt 74 is provided that is operatively connected to guide rollers 76, 78 and 80 rotatably mounted on shafts 82, 84 and 86, respectively. These shafts traverse the distance between the side walls 24 and 26 and their ends are supported by pairs of opposed bracket members 88, 90 and 92 which are mounted on side walls 24 and 26, respectively.As shown in Figs. 2 and 5, the lower outer surface of the guide belt is adapted to frictionally engage the newspapers being advanced by the timing belt 52 and effects rotation of the belt around the guide rollers 76, 78 and 80. To increase or decrease the force with which the guide belt 74 engages the newspapers 60, an idler guide roller 94 is provided which is rotatably mounted on one end of an arm 96. The opposite end of arm 96 is connected to shaft 84 and by any suitable means not shown the arm 96 is selectively positioned in order to increase or decrease the force with which it engages the outer surface of the guide belt 74. The newspapers 60, after passing the uppermost surface of the timing pulley 36, start in a downwardly direction and, to prevent displacement of the side portions of the newspapers not engaged by the guide belt 74, a plurality of guide rods 98 are provided. These guide rods have one end mounted in a bar 100 which traverses the distance between the side walls 24 and 26 and with the ends thereof being attached to the pair of opposed bracket members 90. From the bar 100, the guide rods extend in a generally downward direction toward the gripper type conveyor 68 and are effective in engaging those portions of the newspapers not engaged by the guide belt 74. As shown in Fig. 2, the gripper type conveyor 68 includes a multiplicity of V shaped pockets 102 which are caused to travel in the direction of the indicating arrow 104. As the newspapers travel in a downwardly direction, their contact with the guide belt is lost and permits a newspaper with its cut edges directed downwardly to drop into one of the pockets 102. By a means not shown the newspapers, after entering the pockets 102, are gripped and held till they arrive at a predetermined downstream location whereat they will be subjected to further processing. Although the present invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and the appended claims.
