## Description
METHOD FOR ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY AND PEPTIDE ENZYME CONJUGATE, ITS LYOPHILIZATE, ANTIBODY AND KIT THEREFOR The present invention relates to a method for enzyme immunoassay hereinafter sometimes referred to briefly as EIA and peptide enzyme conjugate and antibody usable forEIA. Bioassay and immunoassay are the procedures currently employed for the high sensitivity quantitative estimation of physiologically active peptides inclusive of hormones, but bioassay has the disadvantages of complicated procedure and poor reproducibility. On the other hand, immunoassays as represented by radioimmunoassay hereafter, sometimes briefly RIA and enzyme immunoassay have the advantages of less complicated procedure and superior quantitative accuracy and reproducibility, but may yield variant results according to the type of antibody used and requires a scrutiny of its specificity.For example, in the quantitative estimation of human chorionic gonadotropin hereafter, sometimes briefly hCG , its cross reactivity with luteinizing hormone hereafter, sometimes hLH , and in the estimation of pancreatic glucagon hereafter, sometimes PG , its cross reactivity with gut glucagon hereafter, sometimes gut GLI present problmes. Meanwhile, the chemical analysis of these peptide hormones has made a significant step forward and an ample knowledge has by now been accumulated about the immunologically specific sites on such peptides as well as their moieties shared by certain other hormones. Accordingly based on such knowledge, various peptide segments are synthesized by chemical procedures and they provide immunologically specific sites of hormones which are to be quantitatively estimated, i.e. the moieties which are not shared by other hormones, and found that it is possible to produce an antibody with very high specificity to the target peptide antigen by absorbing the specific antibody with such a specific peptide fragment partial peptide . B D galactosidase hereinafter sometimes referred to briefly as S Gal is an enzyme which hydrolyzes lactose to galactose and glucose and is effective in the treatment of a disease caused by lactase deficiency. More recently, its importance has further increased as a diagnostic reagent and especially as a label enzyme for EIA. However, in solution, B Gal is unstable regardless of whether it is alone in unbound state or complexed with another component for example, an immunoactive material and is especially unstable at low concentrations below 1 g ml, which is the concentration level employed in practice. Therefore, as an assay reagent, the enzyme is variable in quality and does not give reliable and consistent assay results. Furthermore, it is well known that the enzymatic activity of B Gal tends to decrease significantly even when lyophilized. To overcome the above disadvantages, the present inventors studied for developing a method of stabilizing 6 Gal and found that the lyophilizate of an aqueous composition containing ss Gal and either a sugar or a sugar alcohol is suitable for the above purpose. This finding was followed by further studies which have resulted in the present invention. Human chorionic gonadotropin is a proteohormone produced from chorionic cells which form on gestation, and stimulates secretion of progesterone. Detection of hCG has been commonly utilized in an early diagnosis of pregnancy. Moreover, there have recently been discovered a class of malignant tumors of hCG origin, especially a chorio carcinoma, and hCG has been discovered in high titers in the urine, blood and spinal fluid of tumorbearing patients. Thus, it has become clear that the qualitative and quantitative assays of this hormone are important for the diagnosis, as well as for obtaining a pictureof the clinical course, of such diseases.However, such a diagnosis requires an ability to detect a trace quantity of hCG as small as about 100 IU Q and the problem involved it the immunological cross reactivity of hCG with structurally analogous proteohormones, i.e. luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone hTSH and thyroidstimulating hormone hTSH . Especially, since hLH closely resembles hCG and the concentration of hLH in physiological urine may at times beads as high as 100 to 150 IU , hCG must be immunologically differentiated from hLH in order that the minute amount of hCG in a body fluid may be accurately estimated. Meanwhile, chemical analysis of these proteohormones. has made a further step forward and it has by now been elucidated that the cross reactivity of these hormones is derived from their a subunits which, structurally, have a great deal in common. Therefore, an attempt has been made to separate and purify the B subunit of hCG hereafter briefly, hCG B which is comparatively distinct in structure and prepare an anti hCG ss antibody using the subunit for a specific detection of hCG. However, the separation and purification of hCG B involves a complicated procedure and it is very difficult to prevent contamination witn hCG and its a subunit hereafter, hCG a .Because of the presence of these impurities and the amino acid sequence common to hCG and hLH, the anti hCG ss antibody does not completely overcome the problem of crossreactivity between hCG and hLH. Furthermore, the affinity of this anti hCG B antibody for hCG is lower than that of the anti hCG antibody for hCG, thus causing a reduction of sensitiviFy However, the peptide moiety situated at the Cterminal of hCG ss and consisting of about 30 amino acid residues has an amino acid sequence not shared by hLH and it was found that this moiety permits a distinct identification of hCG versus hLH. Based on this structural analysis.Matsuura et al synthesized a C terminal peptide of hCG 13 t immunized rabbits with the peptide to obtain an hCG specific antiserum and performed a radioimmunoassay Endocrinology 104, p. 396, 1979 1. Though they obtained a satisfactory degree of specificity in this manner, the sensitivity of their method did not prove to be as high as desired. Under the above technological circumstances, the present inventors conducted an intensive research to develop an anti heG antibody that might be capable of detecting hCG with higher specificity and increased sensi activity The present inventors immunized animals with hCG and absorbed the resultant anti hCG antibody onto a carrier having as immobilized thereon a certain syntheticC terminal peptide of hCG ss to obtain an anti hCG antibody, and found that this absorbed anti hCG antibody is specific to hCG without showing a cross reactivity with hLH and other proteohormones. This finding was followed by their further research which resulted in a further finding that an enzyme immunoassay employing an enzyme labeled hCG B C terminal peptide is very useful for a specific and highsensitivity detection of hCG. The present invention is, therefore, directed to 1. A method of producing specific antibodies, which comprises contacting a peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to a peptide antigen, as insolubilized on a carrier, with a body fluid containing an antibody reactive to said antigen and, then, eluting the thus specifically absorbed antibody.2. An enzyme immunoassay method involving the use of an antibody as a reagent, which comprises using as said antibody an antibody obtained by contacting a peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to a peptide antigen, as insolubilized on a carrier, witi a body fluid containing an antibody reactive to said antigen and eluting the thus specifically absorbed antibody.3. A freeze dried material produced by freeze drying an aqueous composition comprising ss D galactosidase or a conjugate of S D galactosidase with an immunoactive material and a sugar or a sugar alcohol.4. A method for the production of a freeze dried material, which comprises freeze drying an aqueous composition comprising ss D galactosidase or a conjugate of ss D galactosidase with an immunoactive material and a sugar or a sugar alcohol.5. A peptide enzyme conjugate prepared by coupling a labeling enzyme with a peptide of the general formula H R1 Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH I wherein R1 is a peptide fragment consisting of 1 to 14 amino acid residues including Gly in the 14 position of the peptide AlaÚ Proê Pro Pro4 Ser5 Leu6 Pro7 Ser 8 Pro9 Ser10 Arg11 Leu12 Pro13 Gly14 6.In a method for enzyme immunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropin involving the use of a peptide enzyme conjugate as an assay reagent, an improvement which comprises using a peptide enzyme conjugate prepared by coupling a labeling enzyme with a peptide of the general formula H R1 Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH I wherein R1 is a peptide fragment consisting of 1 to 14 amino acid residues including Gly in the 14 position of the peptide AlaÚ Proê Pro Pro4 Ser5 Leu6 Pro7 Ser8 Pro 9Ser10 Arg11 Leu12 Pro 13 Gly14 7.

The method for enzyme immunoassay according to the present invention is enumerated as follows 1 the assay which comprises adding a known amount of a peptide enzyme conjugate and a known amount of an insoluble form of antibody to a sample fluid containing an unknown amount of antigen and measuring the enzymatic activity of the peptide enzyme conjugate in the liquid phase or of the reacted peptide enzyme conjugate in the solid phase to estimate the amount of antigen in the sample fluid FEES Letters 15, p. 232 1971 2 the assay which comprises adding a known amount of a peptide enzyme conjugate and a known amount of a soluble form of antibody to an antigen containing sample fluid to effect a competitive binding reaction, then adding a known amount of a second antibody insoluble with respect to the first antibody For example, when the antibody was prepared from rabbit serum, the anti rabbit immunoglobulin G IgG antibody and in the same manner as the above 1 , measuring the enzymatic activity in the liquid phase or solid phase to estimate the quantity of antigen in the sample fluid FEBS Letters, above 3 the assay which comprises addingaknown amount of a peptide enzyme conjugate and a known amount of a soluble form of antibody to an antigen containing sample fluid to effect a competitive binding reaction in the same manner as the above assay 2 , then adding a known amount of a second antibody and, when the second antibody is an anti animal IgG antibody, a known amount of normal animal serum to cause a precipitation reaction and, in the same manner as the assay 1 , measuring the enzymatic activity in the liquid phase or solid phase to estimate the quantity of hCG in the sample fluid Clinica Chimica Acta 67, p. 283 1976 . In any of the above mentioned assays, it is more advantageous to measure the activity of the solid phase because the measurement of enzymatic activity in the liquid phase may suffer from an interference by the impurity in the test fluid. In terms of reproducibility and sensitivity, the 2double antibody assays , i.e. 2 and 3 , are preferred because these assays require only a small amount of antibody The peptide antigens which are to be quantitatively estimated in accordance with the present EIA are the peptide hormones occurring in the bodies of mammalian animals and including hCG, hLH, thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, PG, insulin, growth hormone, etc. Among said mammalian animals are man, cattle, horse, sheep1 rabbit, rat, guinea pig, dog, pig and monkey. The sample fluid to which the EIA of the present invention can be applied may be any of such body fluids as urine, serum, spinal fluid, etc., although urine and serum, in particular, are preferred. As. the antibody used in the present EIA for the detection of other than hCGr the specific antibody obtainable by the present invention is used. The antibody used in the EIA for the detection of hCG, may be any antibody reactive to the C terminal peptide of hCu ss. Examples of such antibody include the conventional anti hCG antibody, the specific anti hCG antibody obtainable by the method of the present invention, the anti hCG serum which is obtainable by immunization with hCG, the anti hCG 6 serum which is obtainable by immunization with hCG 6, the anti C terminal peptide serum which is obtainable by immunization with the Cterminal peptide of hCG B, and the y globulin fractions obtainable from those antisera. In the production of an antibody according to the present invention, an animal is inoculated with the particular peptide antigen to first produce the antibody to said peptide antigen in the body fluid of the animal. This animal may be any species of animal other than man, such as mammalian warm blooded animals e.g. rabbit, sheep, rat, mouse, guinea pig, cattle, horse, pig, goat , avian species e.g. chicken, pigeon, duck, goose, quail and cold blooded animals e.g. frog . The inoculation of such animals with a peptide antigen can be performed in the conventional manner. Then, the body fluid containing such antibody is collected and contacted with a peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to the peptide antigen as insolubilized on a carrier. The term peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to the peptide antigen means a peptide having a partial structure unique to the peptide antigen and not shared by other similar peptide hormones. As examples of such peptides, the following peptides may be mentioned In the production of a specific antibody to hCG, the peptide having the general formula H R1 Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH wherein R1 is a peptide fragment of 1 to 14 amino acid residues including Gly in 14 position of Alal Pro Pro Ser lieu Pro7 Ser8 Pro9 Ser10 L 12 Pro13 oily in the production of a specific antibody to PG, the peptide having the general formula H R2 Phe Val Gln Trp Leu R3 Asn Thr OH wherein R2 is a peptide fragment of 1 to 10 amino acid residues including Asp in 10 position of ss AlaÚ Tyrê Leu Asp4 Ser5 Arg6 Arg7 Ala8 Gln9 Asp10 R3 is Met orNle see European Patent Application Publication No.9147 and in the production of a specific antibody to insulin, a peptide having the general formula H R4 Gly Phe Phe R OH wherein R4 is a peptide fragment of 1 to 3 amino acid residues including Arg in 3 position of Glyl Glu ArgR5 is a peptide fragment of 1 to 5 amino acid residues including Tyr in 1 position of TyrÚ Thê Pro Lys4 Thr5 As examples of the peptide fragments of 1 to 14 amino acid residues including Gly in 14 position of peptide R1 i.e. AlÚ Proê Pr Pr4 Ser5 Leu6 Pro7 Ser8 Pro9 Ser10 Arg11 Leu12 Pro13 Gly14 which is employed in the production of a specific antibody to hCG, there may be mentioned Gly, Pro Gly, Leu Pro Gly, Arg Leu Pro Gly,Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly, Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly, Ser ProSer Arg Leu Pro Gly, Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly, Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly, Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro SerArg Leu Pro Gly, Pro Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu ProGly, Pro Pro Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly, Pro Pro Pro Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly, Ala ProPro Pro Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly and so on. As examples of the peptide fragment of 1 to 10 amino acid residues including Asp in 10 position of R i.e. ss AlÚ Tyê Leu Asp4 Ser5 Arg6 Arg7 Ala8 Gln9 Asp10 1 which is employed in the production of a specific antibody to PG, there may be mentioned Asp, Gln Asp, AlaGln Asp, Arg Ala Gln Asp, Arg Arg Ala Gln Asp, Ser ArgArg Ala Gln Asp, Asp Ser Arg Arg Ala Gln Asp, Leu Asp Ser Arg Arg Ala Gtn Asp, Tyr Leu Asp Ser Arg Arg Ala GlnAsp, ss Ala Tyr Leu Asp Ser Arg Arg Ala Gln Asp and so on.

As regards the peptide fragment of 1 to 5 amino acid residues including Tyr in l position of R5, i.e. TyrÚ Thrê Pro Lys4 Thr5, there may be mentionedTyr, Tyr Thr, Tyr Thr Pro, Tyr Thr Pro Lys and Tyr Thr Pro Lys Thr. The various peptides which are employed in accordance with the present invention can be produced by procedures known per se. While both of the solid phase and the liquid phase methods of synthesis may be employed, the latter method is more often advantageous. Such methods for peptide synthesis include those described in the literature, e.g. Schröder and Lubke The Peptides,Vol. 1 1966 , Academic Press, New York, U.S.A. andIzumiya et al Peptide Gosei Peptide Synthesis 1975 ,Maruzen Inc., Japan viz. the azide method, chloride method, acid anhydride metnod, mixed acid anhydride method, DCC method, active ester method, Woodward Reagent K method, carbodiimidazole method, reduction oxidation method, DCCadditive e.g. HONB, HOBt, HOSu method and so on. The carrier used for the production of the specific antibody according to the present invention includes, among others, beads of gels for example, agarose gel e.g. Sepharose 4B, Sepharose 6B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,Sweden , dextran gel e.g. Sephadex G75, Sephadex G100,Sephadex G200 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , polyacrylamide gel e.g. Biogel P30, Biogel P60, Biogel P100 Bio RadLaboratories, U.SIA. , particles of cellulose for example, Avicel Asahi Kasei Inc. Japan , ion exchange cellulose e.g. diethylaminoethyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose , physical adsorbents ffor example, glass beads, glass rods, aminoalkyl glass beads, aminoalkyl glass rods , silicone rubbers, styrene resin e.g. polystyrene beads, polystyrene granules , ion exchange resins for example, weakly acid cation exchange resins e.g. Amberlite IRC 50 Rohm and Hass, U.S.A. , Zeocarb 226 Permutit, West Germany l, weakly basic anion exchange resins e.g.Amberlite IR 4B Rohm and Hass , Dowex 3 Dow Chemical, U.S.A. and so on. Insolubilization of the peptide on such a carrier can be accomplished in the conventional manner. Among the known methods for the preparation of insolubilized peptides are those described e.g. in Metabolism 8 1971 on page 696. For example, the cyanogen bromide method,GLA method, DCC method, etc. may be employed. The preferred method comprises activating the carrier with cyanogen bromide and causing the peptide to be coupled to the activated carrier. A body fluid containing the antibody is contacted with the peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to the peptide antigen as insolubilized on a carrier in the following manner Thus, for example, the body fluid is fractionally precipitated and, then, it is directly or, after isolation of its immunoglobulin G fraction by column chromatography, the fraction is contacted with the above insolubilized peptide. The above salting out procedure can be carried out using sodium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate or the like. The above mentioned column chromatography is carried out using, for example, diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose, carboxymethyl CM cellulose, DEAE Sephadex, Sephadex G 150, Sephadex G 200 Pharmacia , etc. The elution of the specifically absorbed antibody is carried out using a buffer solution of low pH or high pH, or a buffer solution containing a high concentration of a salt, for instance. The buffer solution of low pH may for example be a 0.17M glycine hydrochloric acid buffer of pH 2.3 or a 0.1M sodium citrate hydrochloric acid buffer of pH 1.8. The buffer solution of high pH may for example be aqueous ammonia at pH 11 or a 0.2 M sodium borate buffer of pH 11.7. The buffer solution containing a high concentration of a salt may for example be a 6 M guanidine hydrochloride solution or a 7 M urea solution. The elution procedure mentioned above may be carried out batchwise or by means of a column. The antibody containing eluate is purfied, for example by dialysis. For example, the eluate is first neutralized, e.g. with 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 10.5 when a buffer solution of low pH was used as an eluent or with 0.1 M glycine hydrochloric acid buffer pH 3.0 when the eluent was a buffer solution of high pH, and then dialyzed against e.g. 0.02 M phosphate NaCl pH 8.0 containing 0.1 NaN3. The eluate obtained with said buffer solution containing a high concentration of aNaCl can be directly dialyzed against the above phosphateNaCl buffer and stored as such. Moreover, the above eluate or dialyzate can be freeze dried and stored as a lyophilizate. The specific antibody produced by the method of this invention can be used in RIA, EIA, latex and erythrocyte agglutination reactions, etc., and in any of these procedures, permits a specific detection of the target peptide antigen without being interfered by cross reactive inhibitory peptide compounds concomitantly present in the test fluid. Especially, the application of the specific antibody of the present invention to EIA permits determinations in clinical laboratories which are not adequately equipped for the handling of radioactive isotopes and is also of value in that it ensures an expedient high sensitivity estimation of peptide antigens in urine and blood samples. More concretely, an anti hCG antibody containing body fluid obtained by immunizing an animal with hCG, especially the serum, is contacted with the insolubilized peptide of general formula I on the carrier. In this step, the body fluid is subjected to salting out precipitation with e.g. sodium sulfate or ammonium sulfate, and either directly or after separation of the IgG fraction by column chromatography with DEAE cellulose or the like, the above insolubilized peptide is contacted with the said fluid or fraction to selectively absorb the specific antihCG antibody onto the solid phase. By the above procedure, anti hCG antibodies showing cross reactivities with hLH, hFSH and hTSH can be eliminated. Then, the specific antihCG antibody absorbed to the solid phase is eluted.This elution is carried out with a buffer solution of low pH or high pH for example, 0.17 M glycine HC1 buffer at pH 2.3 aqueous ammonia at pH 11 or a buffer solution containing a high concentration of a salt for example, 6 M guanidine.hydrochloric acid solution, 7 M urea solution , whereby the specific antibody fraction is separated.Though this procedure may be carried out in a batch method, the use of a column is preferred. When a conjugate of a peptide I H Ala Pro ProPro Ser Leu Pro Ser Pro Ser Arg Leu Pro Gly Pro Ser AspThr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH and Sepharose 4B PharmaciaFine Chemicals is used in the production of the specific antibody, a highly specific anti hCG antibody can be recovered in good yield. The physical properties of this antibody are as follows I At a final dilution of 10 to 200 ng ml, it is capable of binding 10 to 100 of an hCG labeling enzyme conjugate, a peptide I labeling enzyme conjugate, a peptide 11 labeling enzyme conjugate and a peptide III labeling enzyme conjugate, the enzymatic activity of which is about 2uU 2 its optimal pH for antigen binding activity is pH 6 to 9 3 it is stable for more than one year under refrigerator storage conditions 4 it has a molecular weight of about 140 thousand to 170 thousand and contains about 2 to 7 of sugar 5 it is readily soluble in aqueous medium at pH 2 to 12 6 its electrophoretic behavior belongs to that of the y globulin fraction 7 it has an ultraviolet absorption spectrum as reproduced in Fig. 1 8 its amino acid composition in terms of the number of moles of each amino acid per 100 moles of glycine is lysine 85 to 97, histidine 35 to 43, arginine 38 to 45, aspartic acid 110 to 132, threonine 98 to 107, serine 118 to 135, glutamic acid 138 to 145, proline 92 to 134, glycine 100, alanine 73 to 79, valine 129 to 138, methionine 2 to 10, isoleucine 28 to 37, leucine 100 to 112, tyrosine 38 to 48 and phenylalanine 55 to 68 9 its molecule is composed of two H chains and two L chains as coupled by S S bonds. The peptides II and III are obtained in Reference Examples 2 and 3. Thus obtained specific antibody is useful as a reagent in the EIA mentioned above. In comparison with the conventional. methods for the detection of peptide antigen, the enzyme immunoassay according to the present invention provides very specific results and is very instrumental in that it is. free from interferences from the concomitant in test fluids Its sensitivity is high enough to. make the method applicable to the early diagnosis and the prognostic management of chorionic tumors and other diseases Thus, the EIkWaccording to the present invention is practicable even Lm a clinical laboratory where radioactive isotopes cannot be easily utilized, and permits an expedient and specific estimation of the concentration of the. desired peptide antigen in the test fluid. The second antibody used in theEIA according to the present invention can be prepared by repeated injection of the IgG of an animal of the species used in the preparation of antibody erg. rabbit into an animal of a different species e.g. goat . The immunizing procedure may be any of those used routinely for the preparation of antibodies As an example, about 2 mg per dose of IgG, together with Freund s complete adjuvant, is subcutaneously administered at intervals of 3 weeks for a total of about 4 times This procedure provides a. satisfactory antibody. The commercially available anti rabbit IgG serum goat Miles Laboratories, U.S.A. may also be utilized. The second insoluble antibody is prepared by precipitating the above anti IgG serum with sodium sulfate or ammonium sulfate, separating the IgG fraction by DEAEcellulose column chromatography and coupling the same to a solid phase such as a cyanogen bromide activated cellulose or Sephadex FEBS Letters 15, 1971, page 232 .Alternatively, the above anti serum IgG fraction may be contacted with silicon rubbers or polystyrene beads to physically adsorb the second antibody on the solid phase Kagaku to Seibutsu Chemistry and Biology 14 1976 , p. 7411. In the present EIA, a peptide labeling engyme conjugate is used as one of the reagents. The peptide in the peptide labeling enzyme conjugate may be the very peptide antigen as such, but in order to obtain a still higher selectivity, a peptide labeling enzyme conjugate comprising a peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to said peptide antigen is employed. For the quantitative estimation of hCG, for instance, it is preferable to employ a peptide enzyme con 3gate obtainable by coupling a labeling enzyme to a peptide of general formula H R1 Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile lieu Pro Gln OH wherein R1 is as defined hereinbefore. For the measurement of PG is preferable to employ a peptide enzyme conjugate obtainable by coupling a labeling enzyme to a peptide of the general formula H R2 Phe Val Gln Trp Leu R3 Asn Thr OH wherein R2 and R3 are as defined hereinbefore. When the substance to be measured is insulin, it is preferable to employ a peptide enzyme conjugate which is obtainable by coupling a labeling enzyme to a peptide of the general formula H R4 GIy Phe Phe R OH 5 wherein R4 and R5 are respectively as defined hereinbefore. As species of R1, R2, R4 and R5, those mentioned hereinbefore by way of example are useful. As examples of such fragment peptides and the production of the fragment peptide, there may be mentioned the corresponding fragment peptides and the corresponding method for the production of the fragment peptide as described above. The labeling enzyme is desirably an enzyme which is stable and has a high specific activity. Thus, there may be mentioned, for example, 1 carbohydrase for example, glycosidase e.g. a galactosidase, a glucosidase, a glucuronidase, a fructosidase, a galactosidase, a glucosidase, a mannosidase , amylase e.g. a amylase, a amylase, isoamylase, glucoamylase, Taka amylase A , cellulase, lysozyme3, 2 amidase e.g. urease, asparaginase , 3 esterase for example, cholinesterase e.g. acetylcholinesterase , phosphatase e.g. alkaline phosphatase , sulfatase, lipases, 4 nuclease e.g. deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease , 5 iron porphyrin enzymes e.g. catalase, peroxidase, cytochrome oxidase , 6 copper enzymes e.g. tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase , 7 dehydrogenase e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, malic acid dehydrogenase, lactic acid dehydrogenase, isocitric acid dehydrogenase , etc. In the production of the peptide labeling enzyme conjugate according to the present EIA, the substitutable groups, such as amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulfohydryl, etc., contained in the amino acid units a peptides and labeling enzymes can be utilized. These substituents occurring in peptides and labeling enzymes are activated on treatment with condensing agents, etc. and bind themselves to the reactive substitutable groups of the counterpart material to form cross links. The coupling reaction of a peptide with a lebeling enzyme can be conducted in the presence of any condensing agent known to be useful for the coupling of peptides with enzymes. For example, there may be employed 1 watersoluble carbodiimide reagents such as ECDI and CMCT which are capable of effecting a dehydrative condensation of the reactive amino group of either the peptide or the enzyme with the reactive carboxyl group of the mating material in an aqueous solvent, 2 maleimido N hydroxysuccinimide esters such as m MBHS and p MCHS which induce a reaction of the reactive amino group of the peptide with the active N hydroxysuccinimide ester to give a maleimide and, then, induce a reaction with the sulfhydryl group of the enzyme, and 3 dialdehyde reagents such as succindialdehyde andGLA which induce a binding of the reactive amino group of either the peptide or the enzyme with the reactive amino group of the other material. The coupling reaction can be carried out in an aqueous solvent, which may be selected from among the solvents known to be usable for peptide enzyme condensation. Examples include phosphate buffer between pH 6 and 8, borate buffer between pH 7 and 9, etc. The reaction time of this peptide enzyme coupling is normally 30 minutes to 20 hours, but in consideration of the stability of enzymes, a short duration of 30 minutes to 3 hours is desirable However, when the coupling reaction is conducted at low temperature, the reaction time may safely be as long as 2 to 4 days. Usually, the reaction temperature is about 40C to 500C and preferably about 150C to 30 C. Following the above coupling reaction, the resultant peptide enzyme conjugate is purified and isolated by column chromatography using a gel medium such as Sephadex G100 or G200 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals or Sepharose 6B or 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals . 6 D galactosidase which is employed for the purposes of this invention, may be of any origin but it is usually preferable to employ an Escherichia coli derived B Gal which is readily available and high specific activity to synthetic substrates such as o nitrophenyl ss D galacto pyranoside and 4 methylumbelliferyl a D galactopyranoside. B Gal may be used in isolated state or in a form conjugated with an immunoactive material. The immunoactive material may for example be any of antigens, antibodies, and haptens such as drugs. The antigens include hormones e.g. pancreatic glucagon PG , its fragment peptides, insulin, its fragment peptides, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, adrenocorticoid hormones, growth hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and its fragment peptides, luteinizing hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, etc., proteins te.g IgG, immunoglobulin A IgA , immunoglobulin.M IgM , immunoglobulin E IgE , a fetoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen, etc. , virus antigens e.g. rubella virus HA antigen, sendai virus HA antigen, etc. and so on The antibodies include, for example, the antibodies anti PG antibody, anti hCG antibody, anti IgG antibody, anti IgM antibody, anti IgE antibody, etc. obtainable by immunizing mammalian animals such as rabbit, rat, guinea pig, sheep, goat, etc. or avian species such as chicken, duck, goose, etc. with haptens, which are mentioned below, in accordance with the established procedure. As said haptens, there may be mentioned steroids, vitamins, catecholamines, antibiotics and other drugs e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, a adrenergic drugs, etc. , and so on. The above mentioned fragment peptides of hCG include peptides of the following general formula H Rl Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH wherein R1 has the same meaning as defined above. The above mentioned fragment peptides of PG include peptides of the following general formula H R2 Phe Val Gln Trp Leu R3 Asn Thr OH wherein R2 and R3 have the same meaning as defined above. The above mentioned fragment peptides of insulin include peptides of the following general formula H R4 Gly Phe Phe R5 OH wherein R4 and R5 have the same meaning as defined above. Said peptides can be produced in the manner described above. The manner of conjugation of B Gal with an immunoactive material may be covalent bonding. The conjugation of these components can be accomplished, for example, by the method described in Clinica Chimica Acta 81, 1 1977 the method which comprises cross linking the sulfhydryl group of 6 Gal with the amino group of an immunoactive material with the aid of m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide, the method which comprises cross linking the sulfhydryl group of ss Gal with the sulfhydryl group of an immunoactive material with the aid of 0,0 phenylenedimaleimide, the method which comprises cross linking the amino group of S Gal with the amino group of an immunoactive material with the aid of glutaraldehyde, and the method which comprises condensing the amino group or carboxyl group of ss Gal with the carboxyl group or amino group of an immunoactive material with the aid of carbodiimide. As examples of the sugar employed in the practice of this invention, there may be mentioned pentoses such as arabinose, xylose, ribose, etc., hexoses such as glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, etc. disaccharides such as maltose, cellobiose, trehalose, gentiobiose, lactose, sucrose, etc. and trisaccharides such as raffinose, maltotriose, etc. The sugar alcohol includes monosaccharides of 5 carbon atoms, e.g. xylitol, monosaccharides of 6 carbon atoms, e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, inositol, etc.Particularly preferred are arabinose, mannitol, inositol, sucrose and raffinose, and more especially desirable is sucrose. The above mentioned sugar and sugar alcohol may be used as a mixture. The 6 Gal containing aqueous composition according to this invention may further contain albumin in addition to said sugar or and sugar alcohol, and may still further contain magnesium or and calcium ion donors or precursors.Allowing these additional component or components to be present in the composition helps prevent decrease of enzymatic activity in the course of lyophilization and, in the case of a conjugate of 6 Gal and immunoactive material, prevent decrease of immunological activity, in addition to the effect of contributing to an improved shape of the lyophilizate. As examples of the abovementioned albumin, there may be mentioned such serum albumins as human serum albumin, horse serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, sheep serum albumin, etc., although bovine serum albumin is preferred. The above mentioned magnesium or and calcium ion donors or precursors include any and all compounds capable of liberating magnesium or and calcium ions, although magnesium salts and calcium salts may be normally employed.Preferred are magnesium chloride and calcium chloride In the aqueous composition of this invention, the content of ss Gal is an amount equivalent to 10 pg to 1 mg or 0.3 microunit to 30 milliunits per ml of the composition, and preferably 100 pg to 10 pg or 3 microunits to 0 3 milliunit on the same basis. The content of sugar is usually equivalent to a concentration of 0.01 to 20 w v in the aqueous composition and preferably 0.2 to 5 w v on the same basis The content of albumin is usually equivalent to a concentration of 0.01 to 5 w v and preferably 0.1 to 1 w v in the aqueous composition.The concentration of said magnesium or and calcium ion donors in the aqueous composition is 0.0001 to 0.1 M Q and preferably 0.0001 to 0.01 M Q. In preparing the aqueous composition, the order of addition of the components is not critical. The freeze dried material according to this invention is produced by lyophilizing the above aqueous composition at about 300C to 500C and, then, removing the ice by sublimation under reduced pressure at a temperature of about 100C to 200C in the conventional manner. After this freeze drying process, nitrogen gas sealing or vacuum sealing is preferably performed to prevent spoilage and degradation due to microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. The nitrogen gas sealing is usually accomplished by purging the lyophilizate sufficiently with nitrogen gas and sealing it in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The vacuum sealing is usually done by sealing the lyophilizate under reduced pressure e.g. 10 to 0.01 mmHg . The resultant freeze dried material obtained by freeze drying the aqueous composition containing ss Gal and a sugar or a sugar alcohol is very useful as an assay reagent because the enzymatic activity of ss Gal has been substantially kept intact. The freeze dried material obtained by freeze drying the aqueous composition containing a B Gal immunoactive material conjugate and a sugar or a sugar alcohol is useful as a diagnostic reagent, and because of its comparatively low price and high specific activity, is of value as a reagent for EIA. In running an EIA, an antigen enzyme conjugate is added, along with a predetermined amount of antibody, to an antigen containing test fluid to be assayed for a competitive binding reaction and the enzymatic activity bound or not bound to the antibody is determined. In the estimation of hCG by the enzyme immunoassay method of the present invention, a human chorionic gonadotropin EIA kit comprising the following materials is preferably employed. The assay kit using the second insoluble antibody comprises 1 The portion ofan anti human gonadotropin antibody preferably the anti human chorionic gonadotropin antibody prepared by the method of the present invention which binds a given amount preferably about 5 to 100 of the peptide enzyme conjugate of the present invention added to the reaction system 2 A given amount preferably a portion having an enzymic activity of about 0.1 to 500 pU of the peptideenzyme conjugate according to the present invention which may be the lyophilizate according to the present invention 3 From 0 to 500 IU of standard human chorionic gonadotropin 4 A buffer solution preferably a phosphate buffer of pH 6 to 9 which is used for diluting the above reagents 1 to 3 and the sample fluid to be assayed 5 A given amount sufficient to bind all of first antibody 1 1 of an insoluble anti animal IgG carrier conjugate the carrier may be one of those mentioned herebefore 6 A given amount preferably 1 to 100 pg of a.substrate 7 A buffer solution preferably a phosphate buffer or carbonate buffer which is used for washing the second antibody carrier conjugate 5 and dissolving the substrate 6 8 A buffer solution preferably a carbonate buffer or a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide which is used for terminating the enzymatic reaction. The above assay kit is preferably used in the following manner. To 10 300 pt of reagent 1 are added 100 500 pQ of reagent 4 and 5 100 pQ of either the standard human chorionic gonadotropin or the test fluid, followed by addition of 10 300 pZ of reagent 2 . The mixture is allowed to react at 0 400C for 1 to 72 hours. Then, with the addition of a given amount of reagent 5 , the is stirred well and further reacted at 0 400C for 0.5 to 24 hours. Following this reaction, the second antibodycarrier conjugate is washed with reagent 7 and, then, 10 1,000 VQ of reagent 6 is added so as to initiate an enzymatic reaction. The reaction is conducted at 20 400C for 0.5 to 24 hours, at the end of which time it is terminated by the addition of 1 5 ml of reagent 8 .The absorbance or intensity of fluorescence of the reaction system is measured to estimate the concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin in the test fluid. Compared with the conventional methods of producing a specific anti hCG antibody, the method according to the present invention does not involve any complicated procedure for preparation of the immunogen, but provides a highly sensitive and specific antibody in an expedient manner Moreover, in comparison with the conventional methods for hCG detection, the enzyme immunoassay according to the present invention provides very specific results and is very instrumental in that it is free from interferencès from the concomitant hLH, hFSH and hTSH in test fluids. Its sensitivity is high enough to make the method applicable to the early diagnosis and the prognostic management of chorio carcinoma and other diseases.Thus, the EIA according to the present invention is practicable even in a clinical laboratory where radioactive isotopes hereafter, briefly RI cannot be easily utilized, and permits an expedient and specific estimation of serum hCG titfers Moreover, unlike RI labeled peptides which have inevitable half lives, the peptide enzyme conjugate according to the present invention is stable and can be easily produced, with the result that it can be applied successfully to a large number of test samples and provides results with high reproducibility.

Example 8EIA of hCG In a preliminary assay, a mixture of 100 ijL of a dilution of each antiserum, 100 pQ of a peptide ss D galactosidase conjugate and 300 l of an assay buffer 0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.58 human serum albumin, 0.5 ethylenediamine tetraacetate disodium2H2O, 0.1 NaN3 and 0.1 M NaCl was maintained at 5 C for 48 hours, whereby the enzymatically active moiety of the peptide ss D galactosidase conjugate which had a predetermined appropriate enzymatic activity approx. 20 pU ml was bound td the antiserum. To this system was added 100 iiL of a suspension of 2.5 anti rabbit IgG antibodycellulose complex, and the reaction was further conducted at 200C for 4 hours.This mixture was centrifuged and the sediment was washed and suspended in 500 l of a substrate solution a 20 pg ml solution of 4 methylumbelliferyl ss D galactopyranoside in 0.02 M phosphate buffer pE 7.0 containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1 NaN3, 0.1 MNaCl and 1 mM MgC12 . The mixture was allowed to react at room temperature overnight. After this reaction, the fluorescence intensity of 4 methylumbelliferone liberated on decomposition of the substrate was measured at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and a fluorescent wavelength of 450 nm. The assay of hCG in a test fluid was carried out as follows. To a mixture of 50 pQ of the test fluid and 250 l of the assay buffer were added 100 pQ of the antiserum at the above predetermined dilution level and 100 l of the peptide ss D galactosidase conjugate. Thereafter, the same procedure as above was carried out. The results are set forth in Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 is a diagram showing the standard curves of hCG o and hLH x in the ElA using the anti hCG antibody prepared in Reference Example 4 dotted line and the specific anti hCG antibody prepared in Example 1 solid line . In either system, the assay was performed using the hCG labeling enzyme conjugate.The results indicate that while the assay system using the specific anti hCG antibody is comparable to the system using the anti hCG antibody in the sensitivity of hCG detection, the cross reactivity of hLH is less than 1 1,000 as compared with hCG Fig. 5 shows standard curves of hliH in the EIA using the anti hCG antibody prepared in Reference Example 4, where o represents the result for peptide Il B D galactosidase conjugate and x represents the result for the hCG ss D galactosidase conjugate. It is apparent that the cross reactivity of hLH in peptide II ss D galacto sidase conjugate system is very low as compared with the hCG enzyme conjugate system. In the Figs 4 and 5 as well as Figs 6 to 12, B indicates the enzymatic activity bound to a solid phase in the presence of the desired peptide hormone, and Bo indicates the enzymatic activity bound to a solid phase in the absence of the desired peptide hormone. Example 9EIA of hCG As in Example 8, samples containing various dilution levels of antiserum assay buffer 300 Q, peptide alkaline phosphatase conjugate 100 l and antiserum 100 pQ were allowed to stand at 50C for 48 hours, whereby the enzymatically active moiety of each peptide alkaline phosphatase conjugate which had a predetermined appropriate activity ca. 4 mU ml was bound to the antiserum. Then, 50 pQ of antirabbit IgG serum a 10 fold dilution of commercial antiserum and 50 l of phosphate NaCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 2 of normal rabbit serum were added, and the mixture was allowed to stand at 50C overnight.It was then centrifuged and the sediment was washed and resuspended in 500 l of a substrate solution 2 mg ml of p nitrophenylphosphoric. acid in 0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2 pH 9.8 . The reaction was carried out at 370C overnight Following this reaction, the absorbance of p nitrophenol as liberated on enzymatic degradation was measured at 405 nm. The hCG in a test fluid was assayed as follows. To a mixture of 50 l of the test fluid and 250 iit of the assay buffer were added 100 pQ of the antiserum of the dilution factor determined above and 100 pQ of the peptidealkaline phosphatase, and the assay was performed as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 is a diagram similar to Fig. 5, showing standard curves of hLH in the EIA using the anti hCG antibody prepared in Reference Example 4, where o represents the result for the peptide 1 alkaline phosphatase conjugate and x represents the result for the hCG alkaline phosphatase conjugate. It is apparent that the cross reaction of hLH is negligible in the system employing the peptide I alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Fig. 6 shows standard curves of hCG represented by plots o and hLH plots x in the EIA using the specific anti hCG antibody prepared in Example 1 and the peptide Il labeling alkaline phosphatase conjugate in combination. In this assay system, the cross reactivity of hLH is substantially negligible. It will also be apparent that the sensitivity of hCG detection is comparable with that obtainable with the usual assay system represented by o in Fig. 4.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, after which it was dialyzed against water 2 L waterx4 at 40e and freeze dried to give an immunogen.This PG BSP conjugate 2 mg was dissolved in 1 ml of physiological saline and mixed well with 1 ml of Freund s complete adjuvant to prepare an emulsion. This emulsion was injected into the both thighs and subcutaneously at several dorsal sites of the rabbit. The above procedure was repeated at intervals of 2 weeks for a total of 5 times and at one week after the last immunization a blood sample was taken for a pilot assay. In the above manner, there was obtained an anti PG serum reactive to PG and gut GLI. 2 Production of a specific anti PG antibody In lieu of 5 mg of hCG ss C terminal peptide described in Example 1, 5 mg of PG C terminal peptide 15 29 HAsp Ser Arg Arg Ala Gln Asp Phe Val Gln Trp Leu Met AsnThr OH See European Patent Application Publication number 9147, Reference Example 11 was treated in the manner as Example 1 to prepare a PG C terminal peptide 15 29 Sepharose 4B complex. Then, 3 ml of the anti PG serum mentioned in 1 was salted out with anhydrous sodium sulfate and the resultant y globulin fraction was passed through a column 0.9x4 cm of said C terminal peptide 15 29 Sepharose 4B complex. The column was washed with 0.02 M borate buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl to eliminate the antibody crossreactive to gut GLI. Then, elution was carried out with 0.17 M glycine hydrochloric acid buffer pH 2.3 to give a specific anti PG antibody protein content 0.35 mg having a strong affinity for the C terminal peptide of PG. The physicalproperties of this antibody are as follows. Excepting the following items numberes 1 and 8 , the physical properties of the above antibody are analogous with the properties 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 and 9 of the antibody according to Example I.

Then, 100 l of a 5 anti rabbit IgG antibodycellulose conjugate suspension was added and the reaction was further conducted at 300C for 4 hours. The mixture was centrifuged and the sediment was washed and suspended in 500 l of a substrate solution a 20 g ml solution of 4 methylumbelliferyl ss D galactopyranoside in 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1 BSA, 0.1 NaN3, 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM MgC12 and the suspension was incubated at room temperature overnight. After termination of the reaction, the intensity of fluorescence of 4methylumbelliferone liberated on enzymatic cleavage was measured at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and a fluorescent wavelength of 450 nm. For the quantitative estimation of pancreatic glucagon in a test fluid, 100 l of the antiserum of a dilution factor determined as above and 100 p1 of the peptide ss D galactosidase conjugate were added to a mixture of 50 ul of the test fluid, 50 ul of Antagosan and 200 ul of assay buffer and an assay was carried out in the manner as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Fit 8 shows the standard curves of PG o and gutGLI x in EIA using the anti PG serum prepared in the above 1 and PS labeling ss D galactosidase conjugate i Igaku no Ayumi Progress in Medical Science , vol. 103 1977 , p. 25 dotted line and the specific anti PG antibody prepared in Example 10 2 and PG C terminal peptide 2129 labeling ss D galactosidase conjugate Journal ofBiochemistry , vol. 86 1979 , p. 943 solid line . These results indicate that the sensitivity of PG detection with the system employing the specific anti PG antibody is higher than that with the system employing the anti PG serum, and that whereas the anti PG serum shows a strong cross reactivity with gut GLI, the specific anti PG antibody shows substantially no corss reactivity with gut GLI.
