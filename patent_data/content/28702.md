# Cured rubber compositions having improved adhesion to metallic reinforcement.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved cured rubber skim stock com position containing natural rubber utilized in the manufacture of tires, conveyor belts, hoses and the like, and with metallic reinforcement cords embedded therein. The improvement comprises from about 5 to about 25 parts by weight of Neop rene replacing an equivalent amount of natural rubber in order to impart better rubber to metal adhesion and adhesion retention between the rubber skim stock and the metallic reinforcement following exposure to long term humidity chamber tests.
