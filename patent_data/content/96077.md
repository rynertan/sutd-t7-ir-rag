# METHOD OF AGITATING MOLTEN STEEL IN CONTINUOUSLY CASTING MOLD AND APPARATUS THEREFOR.

## Abstract
Technique of agitating molten steel circulating and flowing in a continuously casting mold for the purpose of accelerating degassing and preventing the production of defects in the surface of a casting. In order to provide the desired agitation, a plurality of electromagnetic agitators which can apply magnetic fields of different intensities along both long side walls of the mold are installed to accelerate or decelerate the molten steel circulating stream at different positions, thereby providing a smooth flow.
