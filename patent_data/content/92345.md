# Vectorable nozzles for turbomachines.

## Abstract
A vectorable nozzle 17 comprising a fixed first duct 21 a rotatable second duct 22 scarfed at its rear end and a rotatable third duct 23 scarfed at its front end. The se cond and third ducts 22, 23 are mounted in bearings 24, 26 respectively and the bearing 26 is constrained to swing bodily about trunnions 29 the axis of which lies transverse to the ducts 22, 23 , and a screw jack 30 is provided to ro tate the bearing 26 about the trunnions 29 . The second and third ducts 22, 23 are provided with means to rotate them in opposite directions in syncronism with the rotation of the bearing 26 in the trunnion 29 .
