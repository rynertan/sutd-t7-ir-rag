# Data logging device.

## Abstract
To allow a Salesman to record data relating to merchan dise items which are to be ordered, a logging device comprises a casing 1 in which are housed a keyboard 3 , a display 4 and associated circuits. The salesman locates a sheet 5 , containing a list of merchandise items, on the casing between two columns of light emitting diodes 6 . At the start of entry of an order, the top left hand LED is illuminated under the control of a central processor unit 7 , which simultaneously addresses a main memory storage location corresponding to the item alongside that LED. Data, such as quantity required, can then be keyed into that storage location, which already contains an identification code for that item. The salesman then operates a key which causes the CPU 7 to scan through the LEDs, and the storage locations, in turn, until the next required item on the sheet is reached. Data relating to that item is then keyed in. At the end of each day, the salesman couples a transducer 11 to a public telephone 12 and transmits the data to a computer 14 at his base. Due to the automatic correspondence, at any instant, between the item indicated by an LED and the respective storage location containing the item identity code, the items can be listed in plain language and the salesman does not have to look up item codes. The order can, therefore, be entered rapidly and transmitted back to base without danger of incorrect codes being used.
