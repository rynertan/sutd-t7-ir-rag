# Copolymer of nucleo brominated styrene and acrylonitrile and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fire resistant copolymer of bromostyrene and another monomer, preferably acrylonit rile, and a process for preparing same by emulsion polymer ization to produce copolymers having 95 to 25 weight percent bromostyrene, the balance being the second monomer. The resulting copolymers have a high bromine content in the range 20 to 44 weight percent and may be used as such as a flame resistant plastics material or admixed with other plas tics such as the polyolefins to impart fire resistance to the mixture. The copolymers produced exhibit good mechanical properties and fire resistance values.
