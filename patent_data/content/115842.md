# Magnetic head and method of fabricating same.

## Abstract
A magnetic head core and a method of fabricating same, wherein a magnetic circuit is constituted by a pair of magnetic films 31, 31 having a V shaped cross section which face each other at each protrudent section through the gap material. The cross sectional portion of the V shaped film is exposed to the surface facing the magnetic recording medium. The protrusions of the magnetic film pair have tip planes parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the moving direction of the magne tic recording medium. The tip plane has a width t
