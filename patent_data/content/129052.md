# Method of producing cylindrical permanent magnet.

## Abstract
A method of producing a cylindrical permanent magnet having a multipole surface anisotropy comprises the steps of preparing a metal mold 1, 2 cooperating with a lower punch 7 in defining therein a cylindrical compacting cavity 3 , the metal mold 1, 2 being provided in the inner peripheral sur face thereof with field coils 15 corresponding in number to the number of the magnetic poles of the magnet to be pro duced charging the compacting cavity 3 with a ferromagne tic powder 17 having a magnet anisotropy energizing the field coils 15 to impart a magnetic anisotropy to the fer romagnetic powder 17 while compacting the powder 17 between an upper punch 4 and the lower punch 7 to form a compact demagnetizing the formed compact followed by firing and magnetizing the fired compact in the same direc tion as the anistropy. The field coils 15 produce a pulse magnetic field the intensity of which is not smaller than 3.5 10Â³ ampereturn m when measured at the outer peripheral surface of the compacting cavity 3 , thereby attaining a mul tipole surface anistropy on the compact.
