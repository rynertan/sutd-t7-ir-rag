# A method for dewatering slimes.

## Abstract
A process for dewatering slimes 1 produced in mining and mineral processing operations whereby wet oxidation at 150 320 C renders the solids 11 rapidly settleable. Sufficient oxygen 5 is supplied to meet or exceed oxygen demand. Inorganic solids 11 in the oxidized product are separated and optionally further dewatered to a friable solid. Clarified water 12 is recycled to the mining or processing operations, as is steam resulting from the wet oxidation.
