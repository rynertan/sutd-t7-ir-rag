# FLUID INJECTORS

## Abstract
A tip shut off fluid injector F has its injection device 1 inset to a fixed female interlocking terminal 2 when in the firing position with which a change over valve 4 is connected by pipes P or is made integral. The terminal 2 includes valves 8 and 9 and, optionally, a by pass valve 10. A gearbox 12 con nects between the valves 8, 9 and 10 and a handwheel 11. Rotation of the handwheel 11 inserts or retracts the injection device 1 to or from the firing position and also, via the gearbox 12, rotates the valves 8, 9 and 10 between open and closed positions. Before the injection device 1 can be retracted, the handwheel 11 must be initially rotated to rotate the valves 8 and 9 to closed positions to isolate the fluid supply from the injection device 1 and, optionally, to open the by pass valve 10 to allow fluid to circulate from the supply through the terminal 2 back to return. Conversely, it is not until the injection device 1 is inserted that the valves 8 and 9 can be rotated by the handwheel 11 to open positions to communicate the fluid supply with the injection device 1 and, optionally, close the by pass valve 10. The change over valve 4 may include a direct flow path interconnecting the fluid supply and return when the injection device 1 is retracted. Other kinds of fluid injectors incorporating the invention are envisaged.
