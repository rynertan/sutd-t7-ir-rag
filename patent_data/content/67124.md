France 1972, 3151.With two exceptions, the compounds of formula I produced according to the process of the present invention are novel, therefore the present invention also provides new compounds having the formula R C CHCOCH2CO Z IA wherein Z, R2 and R3 have their previous significance except that, when R2 and R3 are each chlorine, andZ is AY wherein A is 0 then Y is not hydrogen or ethyl. Preferred compounds of formula IA are those whereinZ is AY in which A is O or NR7 and R2, R3 and Y have their previous significance. More preferred are those compounds wherein Z is AY in which A is O or NR7, R2 and R3 are chlorine and Y has its previous significance. Most preferred are compounds of formula I wherein Z is A in which A is 0, R2 and R3 are each chlorine and Y is H or C1 C6 alkyl optionally substituted by from 1 to 5 chlorine atoms and those wherein A is NR7 wherein R7 is H or C1 C6 alkyl, R2 and R3 are each chlorine and Y has its previous significance. The compounds of formula I have bee found to be active as antibacterial and antifungal agents. Moreover, these compounds are useful as intermediates for example for biologically active compounds such as the pyrazolyl thiophosphates described in German Patent Specification 2855256. Accordingly, the present invention also provides an antibacterial and antifungal composition comprising, as active ingredient, a compound of formula I. The compounds of the formula I possess for practical purposes a very advantageous microbicidal spectrum for protecting cultivated plants. Examples of cultivated plants within the scope of this invention are cereals, maize, rice.vegetables, sugar beet, soya , ground nuts, fruit trees ornamentals, vines, hops, cucumber plants cucumber, marrows, melons , solanaceae, such as potatoes, tobacco plants and tomatoes, and also banana, cocoa and natural rubber plants. With the active compounds of the formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy the fungi which occur in plants or parts of plants fruit, blossoms, leaves stems, tubers, roots in these and also related crops of useful plants, and also to protect from attack by such fungi the parts of plants which grow later. The active compounds are effective against the phytopathogenic fungi which belong to the following classes Ascomycetes e.g. Helminthosporium Basidiomycetes, in particular rust fungi e.g. Puccinia fungi imperfecti e.g. Moniliales e.g. Cercospora and against the Oomycetes belonging to the class of the Phycomycetes, such asPhytophthora. The compounds of the formula I are also effective against phytopathogenic bacteria such as Xanthomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Erwinia and Corynebacterium.In addition, the compounds of the formula I possess a systemic action. They can also be used as seed dressing agents for protecting seeds fruit, tubers, grains and plant cuttings from infection and from phytopathogenic microorganisms which occur in the soil. The present invention still further provides an antimicrobial composition comprising an amount of a compound of formula I which is effective against the growth of bacteria and fungi which are pathogenic to plants. The antimicrobial compositions according to the invention are prepared in a manner which is in itself known by intimate mixing and grinding of active compounds of the formula I with suitable carriers, if desired with addition of dispersing agents or solvents which are inert towards the active compounds. The active compounds may exist, and be used, in the following processing forms Solid processing forms dusting agents, sprinkling agents, granules, coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules. Active compound concentrates which are dispersible in water wettable powders, pastes and emulsions. Liquid processing forms solutions. In order to prepare solid processing forms dusting agents, sprinkling agents and granules , the active compounds are mixed with solid carriers. Examples of carriers which can be used are kaolin,talc, bolus, loess, chalk, limestone, lime grits, attapulgite, dolomite.diatomaceous earth, precipitated silica, alkaline earth metal silicates, sodium and potassium aluminosilicates feldspars and micas , calcium and magnesium sulphates, magnesium oxide, ground plastics, fertilisers, such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate and urea, ground vegetable products, such as cereal flour, bark flour, wood flour, nutshell flour, cellulose powder, plant extract residues, active charcoal and the like, in each case on their own or as mixtures with one another. Granules can be prepared by, for example, dissolving the active compounds in an organic solvent, applying the solution thus obtained to a granulated material, for example attaulgite, silica, granicalcium or bentonite and then again evaporating the organic solvent. It is also possible to prepare polymer granules by, for example, impregnating finished, porous polymer granules such as urea formaldehyde polymers, polyacrylonitrile and polyesters, having a specific surface area and an advantageous predetermined absorption desorption ratio, with the active compounds, for example in the form of their solutions in a low boiling solvent and removing the solvent. Such polymer granules can be applied in the form of micro granules with bulk densities of, preferably, 300 g litre to 600 g litre, also with the aid of atomisers. Atomising canbe effected over extensive treatment areas by means of aircraft. Granules can also be obtained by compacting the carrier with the active compounds and additives and then comminuting the mixture. Furthermore, it is possible to add to these agents additives which stabilise the active compound and or nonionic, anionic and cationic materials which, for example, improve the adhesion of the active compounds to plants and parts of plants adhesives and glues and or ensure better wettaoilityçwetting agents and dispersibility dispersing agents .It is possible to use, for example, the following materials as adhesives olein lime mixture, cellulose derivatives methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose , hydroxyethylene glycol ethers of monoalkylphenols and dialkylphenols having 5 to 15 ethylene oxide residues per molecule and 8 to 9 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, ligninsulphonic acid, its alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts, polyethylene glycol ethers Carbowaxes , fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers having 5 to 20 ethylene oxide residues per molecule and 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the fatty alcohol part, condensation products of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, polyvinyl alcohols, condensation products of urea formaldehyde and latex products. Water dispersible active compound concentrates, i.e. wettable powders, pastes and emulsion concentrates, are agents which can be diluted with water to any desired concentration. They consist of active compound, carrier, if desired additives which stabilise the active compound, surface active substances and anti foaming agents and, if desired, solvents. The wettable powders and pastes are obtained by mixing and grinding the active compound with dispersing agents and pulverulent carriers in suitable devices until homogeneity is achieved. Examples of carriers are those mentioned above for the solid processing forms. In some cases it is advantageous to use mixtures of different carriers.Examples of dispersing agents which can be used are condensation products of sulphonated naphthalene and sulphonated naphthalene derivatives with formaldehyde, condensation products of naphthalene or of naphthalenesulphonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, and alkali metal salts, ammonium salts and alkaline earth metal salts of ligninsulphinic acid, as well as alkylarylsulphonates, alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of dibutylnaphthalenesulphonic acid, fatty alcohol sulphates, such as salts of sulphated hexadecanols and heptadecanols, and salts of sulphated fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol ethers, the sodium salt of oleyl methyl tauride, di tertiary acetylene glycols, dialkyldilauryl ammonium chloride and alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of fatty acids.
