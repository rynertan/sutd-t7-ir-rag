## Description
INK COMPOSITION FOR INK JET PRINTING This invention relates to an ink composition for ink jet printing. More particularly, the invention pertains to an ink composition for ink jet printing, which composition exhibits quick drying performance when used in recording Pieces of information therewith on a sheet of ordinary paper and which is especially suitable for use in an ink jet printing process where ink is extruded through nozzles to project onto the sheet by the action of sudden reduction of an inner volume of an ink chamber. The ink jet printing process, according to which an ink liquid is jetted under control onto a recording carrier to print desired information thereon without bringing a printing head into contact with the surface of the recording carrier, has her etofore been adopted by end printers and out rapidly into wide use in recent years for such reasons that the recording can be performed without noise and at high speed, and that sheets of ordinary paper can be used as recording sheets neces sark for the recording. Ink jet printing process generically known heretofore includes in the concrete an ink jet printing process wherein an ink liquid is projected through nozzles by rapidly reducing an inner volume of an ink chamber or by extrusion of suction at a definite pressure, an ink jet printing process wherein an ink liquid is spurted statically and acceleratedly by applying a signal voltage between nozzles and electrodes standing opposite to each other, or an ink mist process wherein a mist of ink is generated by vibration of supersonic waves. Ink compositions which are used in the ink jet printing processes of the above types or in the ink mist printing process are required to have such characteristics as mentioned below i The ink composition should have sufficient density necessary for the performance of recording, ky it does not evaporate to dryness clogging within jet nozzles, iii the ink liquid drops as attached to a recording sheet to form characters of information quickly dry quick drying performance , ir the recorded ink does not blot when brought into contact with water or sweat and printed portions formed said recorded ink do not disappear therewith, and v the composition, when stored, does not undergo any change in its physical properties or does not produce any precipitate. As a measure of satisfying quick drying of ink adopted heretofore, there is known a process wherein such ink which is difficultly evaporatable, per se, is used as the ink and a recording sheet having such high permeability as an absorbant paper is used as the recording sheet and thereby to allow the ink to penetrate the recording sheet to obtain an apparently dried state thereof. This process, however, possesses such drawbacks that, though no clogging caused by evaporation of ink within nozzles occurs, the recording sheets usable therein come to be limited to those which readily absorb the ink and the consumers have to use, as the recording sheet, only such paper as designated by paper manufacturers for the purpose, accordingly the cost of paper to be borne by the consumers becomes relatively high. Another measure known as a process for satisfying quick drying of ink is to add solvents having relatively high vapor pressure to ink and thereby to dry the ink as jetted or misted.In this process, however, though quick drying of ink can satis factorily be attained, there involves such drawback that the ink retained at the top end of nozzle during suspension of the operation of such apparatus as ink jet printer having nozzles of inner diameter as small as about 50 to about 100 can comes to evaporate and dry to cause clogging of the nozzles. On that account, it is necessary to keep the top end of nozzle covered or take the like measures during suspension of the use ink jet printer for the purpose of preventing the ink within the nozzle from evaporation and drying. Still another measure known as a process for satisfying quick drying of ink is to incorporate into ink a small amount of such solvent as having relatively good permeability through paper. However, no sufficient print quality could be obtained by the use of solvents in amounts as specified hitherto in the prior art processes, and the processes were found to be of very little real use. The present invention has been made with the intention of obviating such drawbacks as associated with the prior art ink compositions, and an object of the invention is to provide an ink composition for ink jet printing, said composition having such characteristic feature that the ink possesses properties contrary to each other, that is, the ink itself is difficult to evaporate and dry to cause clogging when it is retained within nozzles but it immediately dries as solon as it is attached to the paper surface for ink jet printing and, moreover, that the thus attached ink forms clear and beautiful prints on paper of any kind. The above mentioned object of the present invention can be accomplished by providing an ink composition hereinafter called the present ink for ink jet printing, characterized by comprising water, a dye selected from the group consisting of a water solubRe direct dye and a water soluble acid dye and at least 20 by weight of a compound hereinafter called the present compound represented by the following general formula I3 CnH2 n FtOCH2CH2tmOH wherein m and n respectively represent 2 m 6 and m 1 n m 3. Generally, in order that the ink which attached to paper by ink jet printing process is allowed to form prints of good quality without ink blotting, it is believed to be sufficlent that the surface tenstion of the ink is higher by about 45 dyn cm than a critical surface tension of a recording sheet. Apart from the case of certain recording sheets which have specially been prepared so as to impart excellent ink absorbing property thereto, however, such ink as referred to above does not serve at all as a quick drying ink in case where common a woodfree paper is used as the recording sheet. Very important two factors necessary for the quick drying property referred to above.are such that ink can uniformly wet the surface of a recording sheet and that the ink can quickly permeate through the recording sheet. With respect to the former factor, it is known that when the surface tension of ink has a relatively low value, for example,. 45 dyn cm, the factor is satisfied to a fairly satisfactory extent With regard to the latter factor, however, by judging only from a value of surface tension of ink no one can ascertain whether the factor can be satisfied or.notr For instance, such ink as incorporated with a surfactant of about a critical micell concentration so as to have its surface tension lower than a critical surface tension of a recording sheet certainly wets the recording sheet surface uniformly, but the ink requires a long period of time to permeate through the recording sheet that is, its quick drying performance becomes poor . On that account, the ink attached to the recording sheet surface increasingly spreads in the lateral direction of said sheet and finally ends in deterioration of print quality. Accordingly, in case where ink is intended to have quick drying property to a satisfactory extent and give high print quality, it is desirable to incorporate into the ink such in gredients as capable of lowering a surface tension of the ink and simultaneously improving permeability through paper of said ink. The present compounds may be considered useful as the ingredients referred to above. It has heretofore been known that a small amount of such ingredient, for example, as ethylene glycol n butyl ether, is incorporated into ink for the purpose of imparting antimicrobial property thereto or improving water resistance or light fastness of a dye contained in the ink refer to Japanese PatentLaid Open to Public Publn. No. 32566 1981 and Japanese PatentPublication No. 251 1972 . By the use of the prior art ink compositions, however, it was not possible to satisfy simultaneously both favorable quick drying performance and high print quality. One of the characteristic features of the present inven tion is that the present ink contains therein large amounts of the present compounds. Another one of the features of the present invention is that water soluble direct dye or acid dye is used in the ink of the present invention, and the object of the present inven tion cannot be accomplished when other kinds of dyes, for ex ample, water soluble basic dyes, are used in the present ink in place of the dye of the present invention. Generally, what has heretofore found general acceptance is that ink having a low surface tension is inferior in projecting stability as well as in frequency response. In this connection, however, the present ink is superior in any of two character istics mentioned above to any other conventionally known ink. Typical examples of the present compounds are exemplified below. 1 C3H7 OCH2CH2 2OH 2 C4H9 OCH2CH2 2OH 3 C5H11 OCH2CH2 20H 4 C4H9 OCH2CH2 3OH 5 C5H11 OCH2CH2 3OH 6 C6H13 OCH2CH2 3OH 7 C5H11 OCH2CH2 40H 8 C6H13 OCH2CH2 4OH 9 C7H15 OCH2CH2 4OH 10 C6H13 CH2CH2 5OH 11 C7H15 OCH2CH2 5OH 12 C8H17 OCH2CH2 5OH 13 C7H15 OCH2CH2 6OH 14 C8H17 0CH2CH2 60H 15 C9H19 OCH2CH2 6OH The present compounds are particularly preferable satisfy the relation of n m 2, the concrete example of which are the above mentioned exemplified compounds 2 , 4 , 8 , 11 and 14 . The present compound is used in an amount of at least 20 by weight based on the total amount of ink composition, and if the amount of the present compound used is less than 20 by weight no sufficient print quality is obtained, though the quick drying performance can be attained to a certain extent. In the present invention, the present compounds can be used in combination of two or more, provided that the total amount of compounds used is at least 20 by weight based on the ink composition.

Entiring ratio into paper of the wetting agent is obtained by measuring an area at which the agent spreads when said agent is dropped in a definite amount on paper of a definite thickness. The wetting agent used in accordance with the present invention is particularly preferably those which have the entiring ratio of at least 30 , preferably more than 40 . Preferred wetting agent include ethylene glycol diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, trimethyle ne glycol, tetraethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,5 pentanediol, thiodiethanol, pro pylene glycol, formamide, diethanolamine, N hydroxyethyl 2pyrrolidone, C pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, etc. Of these wetting agents illustrated above, particularly preferred are ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, propylene glycol, formamide, diethanolamine and dimethylsulfoxide. The wetting agent in accordance with the present invention is preferably used in an amount, based on the present ink, cf 5 60 by weight, particularly 20 60 by weight, since prevention of clogging due to evaporation of the ink at the top end of nozzle becomes insufficient when the agent is used in an amount of less than 5 by weight and the ink comes to increase in its viscosity if the amount of the agent used exceeds 60 by weight. In this connection, the wetting agents according to the present invention may be used in combination of two or more, and they are also usable for the purpose of regulating such physical properties of the present ink as viscosity, etc. The present ink comprising water, a water soluble direct dye or a water soluble acid dye and the present. compound may optionally be incorporated with a variety of additives, if necessary. For instance, the present ink when it is anticipated to be stored for an extended period of time may be incorporated with antiseptics or antimolds for preventing or reducing the growth in the ink of bacteria or fungi. Of a variety of antiseptics heretofore known as useful for the above purpose, desired is, for example, 1,3,5 hexahydrotriazine derivative Bacillat 35 produced and sold by Hoechst . In addition thereto, the present ink may be incorporated with surfactants in order to regulate the surface tension of the ink, said surface tension predominating the desired wetting of the ink on a recording sheet. Without any particular limita tion, any surfactants are usable for this purpose so long as they are not excessively low in solubility or they do not bring about interaction with dyes, and preferably usable as the surfactants in this sense are polyoxyalkylene and alkyl. ethers thereof, siloxane oxyalkylene copolymers, fluorine contained surfactants, etc. These surfactants are commercially available. The amount of such surfactant to be incorporated is generally less than 1 , particularly desirably ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 by weight based on the total amount of the present ink. Furthermore, various inorganic or organic buffer can be incorporated into the present ink for the purpose of preventing the ink from change in pH due mainly to absorption of carbonic acid gas present in air during storage of the ink in an ink chamber or retention of the ink in nozzles Desirable buffers include, for example, such carbonates as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and from a practical standpoint they are suitably used in an amount of 0.1 5 , preferably 0.1 2 by weight based on the total amount of the present ink. Stil l further, the present ink may contain various chelating agents for the purpose of masking metals. and metal. ions present in the ink. As individuals typical of the buffers used in accordance with the present invention, there may be mentioned sodium gluconate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA , disodium salt of EDTA, trisodium salt of EDTA, tetrasodium saltof EDTA, sodium salt of diethylenetriaminopentaacetic acid, etc. These buffers are suitably used in an amount of 0.1 5 , preferably 0.1 2 by weight based on the total amount of the present ink.
