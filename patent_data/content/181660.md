# Line take up assembly especially suitable for a lift truck.

## Abstract
A take up assembly 10 for storing and selectively feeding and taking up flexible hydraulic hoses 20 extending between the body or mast 12 of a lift truck 14 and the vertically reciprocating load carriage 18 of the truck includes mechanical design features for facilitating servicing while mounted on the truck 14 . In particular, the assembly 10 has a reel structure 22 providing a line storing hub 56 comprising two separate line supporting surface portions 56a, 56b, 56c 56d , each having axially extending widths traversing substantially the entire distance between flanges 52, 54 of the reel. The outer flange 52 of the reel 22 is detachably connected by connectors 66 to the hub 56 for permitting removal of the flange together with one 56d of such line supporting hub portions, while retaining in place substantially the entire width of the other line supporting portion 56a, 56b, 56c of the hub. The removable line supporting portion 56d of the hub is located adjacent line attachment fittings 40 within the hub so as to facilitate access thereto, and comprises only a minor portion of the line supporting surface area of the hub so that the wound coils of the line 20 remain supported despite such removal.
