# Device and method for cleaning waste water.

## Abstract
Device and method for cleaning waste water, where in the waste water 19 and oxygen gas 31 are flowing in opposite directions through a cylindrical multireactor 20 having a central rotatable pipe 24 , the multireactor comprising a number of bioreactors and at least one separation chamber 75 . The average pressure differ ence between two successive bioreactors is at most seven meter water column. The bioreactors are sepa rated from each other by stationary walls 40, 41, 48, 55, 60 and each bioreactor has its own mixing device 50 for mixing waste water and oxygen gas.
