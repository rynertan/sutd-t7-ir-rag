# Fibre optic hydrophone transducers.

## Abstract
Fibre optic hydrophone transducer is provided including a light source 21 , a transducer 20 and a detector 22 , which is capable of detecting applied acoustic signals 23 . The transducer employs first and second ridged members 25, 26 which have parallel rippled surfaces 27, 28 which contact opposite sides of a fiber optic waveguide 24 . Each rippled surface 27, 28 has a different predetermined ripple pitch which provides for variable sensitivity along one dimension of the transducer 20 . Modulation of the position of the ridged members 25, 26 relative to one another by means of applied acoustic signals 23 causes microbend attenuation of light transmitted through the waveguide 24 . The modulation of the light provides an indication of the presence of the acoustic signals 23 . The variation in dimensional sensitivity provided by the transducer 20 allows for a determination of the direction of arrival oof the acoustic signals 23 . Appropriate selection of pitch and pitch ratio of the two rippled surfaces 27, 28 provides any desired spatial sensitivity distribution of the hydrophone. A transducer is also disclosed which further incorporates magnetic elements to provide a mechanical prestress bias to the waveguide, thus providing a frictionless and hyteresis free device.
