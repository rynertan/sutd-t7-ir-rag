# Apparatus for setting a blind fastener.

## Abstract
An improved pulling head is provided for setting blinds fasteners, such as by pulling the setting pin of a blind rivet or the like, wherein the pulling head is rapidly and easily adjustable for use with blind fasteners of different sizes or types. The improved pulling head comprises an elongated support housing carrying a sliding draw bolt assembly for grasping and pulling a setting pin inserted into a nose end of the support housing through a selected one of a plurality of head inserts of selected different sizes of types. The head inserts are carried by a generally cone shaped turret cap mounted at the support housing nose end for rotation about an axis offset from the direction of sliding draw bolt assembly movement thereby permitting the selected head insert to be rotated to an operative position in front of the draw bolt assembly and the remaining nonselected head inserts to be stationed in inoperative positions spaced from contact with the structure being fastened. The pulling head is adjusted by simple rotation of the turret cap to rotate an alternative selected head insert to the operative position, with a spring loaded detent mechanism acting between the turret cap and the support housing to releasably retain the selected head insert in the operative position.
