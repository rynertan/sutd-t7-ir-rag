## Description
Enzyme solutions and method for the preparation thereof.The invention relates to enzyme solutions and method for the preparation thereof.For the application of enzymes, in particular in enzymatic industrial processes, stabilization is a necessity.For economic reasons a high longevity is of importance in that respect.Up till now two methods are known for this purpose basically.The one method consists in immobilizing an enzyme on a carrier suitable for said purpose, i.e. a catalyst on a carrier.The other method consists in stabilization in solution.The invention relates to this second possibility.Various modifications of stabilization in solution are described in the article Enzyme stabilization without carriers , Enzyme Microb.Technol.1979, Vol.l, April, pp.74 82.As an example of a suitable stabilizer to that purpose is mentioned albumin, a protein from chicken eggs.Therein an enzyme is dissolved in a buffer solution, to which albumin has been added.Notwithstanding an improved stability of the solutions, thus obtained, the stability appears to diminish substantially with time.According to the invention is now provided an enzyme solution with a much higher stability, in which the enzyme is dissolved in the complete white of egg fraction, in particular of chicken eggs.It has appeared that the white of egg fraction is an outstanding stabilizer for enzymes, such as for example oxidizing, reducing and hydrolizing enzymes the white of egg fraction does not provide significant advantages for proteolytic enzymes.More in particular the invention relates to an enzyme solution consisting completely or partially of a solution of one or more enzymes in the undenatured white of egg fraction.As mentioned above, the white of egg fraction of chicken eggs has been found to be particularly suitable for the said purpose.Stabile enzyme solutions are of importance for various applications, such as for example the conversion of macromolecular substrates, wherein the use of an enzyme immobilized on a carrier is in general adversely affected by physical, in particular steric hindrance, resulting in an undesirably low enzyme activity.Moreover a carrier matrix may have a disturbing effect with respect to the action of the enzyme, in particular in medical applications.The enzyme solution according to the invention is especially of importance for use in enzyme reactors, in which dissolved enzymes are used.An example of enzyme reactors are membrane reactors in which the membrane is only permeable for the product formed.The invention also relates to a method for stabilizing enzymes, whether or not in solution, wherein one or more enzymes are dissolved in an undenatured white of egg fraction, preferably the white of egg fraction of chicken eggs.Moreover the invention relates to a method for carrying out an enzymatic process, wherein as catalyst is used an enzyme solution as described hereinabove, or an enzyme solution obtained by the method as described hereinabove.The invention is further elucidated by the following examples, wherein undenatured white of egg fractions have been used, derived from chicken eggs, goose eggs and duck eggs respectively. Example IHydrolysis of lactose by means of lactaseLactose lactase glucose galactoseLactase galactosidase in a quantity of 250 mg was dissolved in 50 ml each of white of egg fraction of chicken eggs, duck eggs and goos eggs respectively, all neutralized to pH 7 with lactic acid.After some drops of toluene had been added for protection against microbial infection, the solutions were stored at 50C.With intervals of one week each time o.5 ml of these enzyme solutions were mixed with 25 ml of lactose solution 5 g lactose, dissolved in a mixture of 90 ml demineralized water and 10 ml of a 0.05 molar phosphate buffer, pH 7 .After reacting for 5 hours at 250C the conversion in all cases was determined by means of an Autoanalyzer method, whereby the total reducing capacity was measured.For comparison a solution of 250 mg lactase in 50 ml of a 0.05 molar phosphate buffer, pH 7, was prepared and stored under the same conditions and sampled and measured weekly.In Table A hereinbelow are presented the results obtained of the measured conversion after 5 hours for the various storage periods, starting from two weeks.
