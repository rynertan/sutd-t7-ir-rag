# Apparatus for storing information storage mediums into casings.

## Abstract
Information storage mediums such as video discs are picked up by a pickup device and transferred one at a time to a storage position in which the video disc is placed on a disc rest. Casings stocked in a stocker are pushed one at a time by a casing pusher to the storage position. The casing is supported by a casing holder mechanism, retracted away from the storage position to allow the disc to be supported on the rest, and then displaced toward the storage position to let the disc be inserted into the casing supported on the holder mechanism. A completed assembly of the disc and casing is temporarily stocked, and a predetermined number of such stocked assemblies are discharged onto a dis charge conveyor.
