# Electrophoretic display device.

## Abstract
An electrophoretic display device is described where a set of anode electrodes 7, 7 in an electrophoretic cell are disposed opposite row and column electrodes 5, 6 at a second side of the electrophoretic cell. The anode electrodes 7, 7 encompass equal pluralities of at least the row electrodes 6 , and such equal pluralities of electrodes 6 are connected in parallel. This significantly reduces the number of drivers and leads to the display.
