# Dry enzyme formulations containing d amino acid oxidase.

## Abstract
A stable formulation of a non cellulosic fabric having D amino acid oxidase coated and dried thereon is shown. The fabric may be woven, nonwoven, or knit and may be made from polyolefin, nylon, polyester, or polyurethane fabrics. Polyolefin fabrics may be pretreated with a surfac tant. Also shown are formulations containing some or all of the reagents used to detect beta lactam antibiotics. Kits having webs coated with analytically effective amounts of D amino acid oxidase, peroxidase, flavin adenine, dinuc leotide, a peroxide sensitive dye and a D,D carboxypeptidase suhstrate containing a carboxyterminal D alanine are shown. D,D carboxypeptidase R39 enzyme may be provided separ ately in either aqueous form or dried on a separate piece of fabric. Under appropriate conditions the D,D carboxypeptidase may also be dried on the fabric.
