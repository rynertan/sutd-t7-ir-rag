## Description
IMPROVED PNEUMATIC ROBOT WRIST BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Manipulator apparatus, often referred to as part of robot systems, have found widespread acceptance in numerous assembly applications. The accuracy and reliability of such applications depend to a significant extent on the accuracy and repeatability of the wrist which controls the positioning of the end effector, i.e., gripper. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides an improved robotic wrist assembly, offering desirable features and overcoming disadvantages of the prior art arrangements. In its broad form, the invention comprises a pneumatic wrist apparatus for a robotic structure, com prising, a first tubular assembly having a tubWlar in eX linear bearing sleeve, a second tubular assembly including a stationary rod and piston combination and a closed end tubular quill member disposed coaxially about said rod and piston combination for vertical movement about said rod and piston and within said linear bearing sleeve of said first tubular assembly, means coupled to said first tubular assembly to impart rotational motion to the combination of said first tubular assembly and said tubular quill member about said rod and piston, said stationary rod and piston combination defining first and second isolated pneumatic chambers within said tubular quill member, means for varying the pneumatic pressure within said first chamber to effect vertical movement of said tubular quill member in one direction and for varying the pneumatic pressure in said second chamber to effect vertical movement of said tubular quill member in the opposite direction, and an end effector support means coupled to an end of said tubular quill member. In a preferred embodiment described herein, there is provided a simplified pneumatic robot wrist assembly wherein a tubular wrist assembly including a tubular quill member is slidably positioned relative to a stationary tubular rod and piston arrangement to effect vertical movement of a robotic end effector in response to variations in pneumatic pressure developed within the tubular member. Air introduced via the stationary tubular rod and piston and or an assembly adaptor establishes the vertical position of the end effector of the tubular wrist assembly.Continuous rotation of the tubular wrist assembly is implemented through a bevel gear set which is coupled to aDC servomotor by a torque tube assembly. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will become more readily apparent from the following exemplary description to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a pictorial illustration of a manipulator apparatus including a pneumatic wrist assembly in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a sectioned illustration of the pneumatic wrist assembly of Figure 1 and the robot arm supporting the wrist assembly and Figure 3 is a sectioned illustration along the lines A A of Figure 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Figure 1 there is illustrated a conventional manipulator apparatus 10 comprising a base assembly B including drive motors M and a vertical column C supporting a primary arm assembly P from which is extended a secondary arm assembly S. A modular wrist W in combina tion with an end effector E is affixed to the secondary arm assembly S. The operation of the manipulator apparatus 10 is controlled from the control console CC. The rotational motion of the primary arm assembly P and the secondary arm assembly S is controlled by the drive motors M and a drive arrangement coupling the drive motors M through the base assembly B and the column C. A manipulator apparatus of this type is illustrated and described in detail in U.S.Patent 4,392,776, entitled Robotic Manipulator Structure which is assigned to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and incorporated herein by reference. While there are numerous techniques for implementing the operation of the wrist assembly W to effect movement and operation of the end effector E, the pneumatic wrist assembly illustrated in detail in Figures 2 and 3 depicts a relatively simple, efficient and reliable wrist assembly configuration. The pneumatically actuated wrist assembly 20 ofFigure 2 includes a tubular assembly 21 having a quill 22 positioned for vertical movement within a tubular linear bearing assembly 24 in response to pressure changes in chambers A and B defined by the stationary combination of the tubular rod 26 and piston 28. The end effector mounting plate 30 is secured to the movable quill 22 and supports the end effector E, i.e., grippes etc. The rotational movement of the quill 22 about the tubular rod 26 is accomplished by the bevel gear set 32 consisting of a ring gear 34 secured to the tubular bearing assembly 24 and a pinion gear 36 operatively coupled to a DC servomotor 38 by the drive shaft, or torque tube, 40. The pinion gear 36 responds to the DC servomotor 38 by imparting rotation to the assembly 21 via the ring gear 34.The duplex bearing 42 supports the drive shaft 40 and functions to axially retain the bevel gear set 32. This permits adjustment to the running clearance in the gear set 32 so as to both minimize backlash in the wrist axis drive train and compensate for wear in the gearing. The four way solenoid valve 44 secured within the secondary arm S of the robot 10 controls the pneumatic pressure in chambers A and B of the assembly 21 by controlling a flow of air through tubes 46 and 48. Air tube 46 is connected through fittings 50 to the tubular rod 26 to introduce air pressure in chamber A thereby increasing the volume of the chamber and moving the assembly 21 and its associated end effector support plate 30 downward toward an assembly work station WS. Air supplied through tube 48, which is connected through fitting 52, introduces air pressure within chamber B via passage 69 with the resulting increase in volume of chamber B causing the assembly 21 to move upward, or away from the assembly work station WS. A second four way solenoid valve 45, positioned within the secondary arm S of Figure 2, provides pneumatic control to the end effector E. The assembly 21 is supported within the housing H of the wrist assembly W by a mounting bracket 54 and the interconnect 50. A shoulder 56 at the end of the rod 26 extending through the aperture 58 of the mounting plate 54 permits the tubular rod 26 to be self aligning and float on the seals within the assembly adapter 60 of the assembly 21. This feature reduces the effects of friction, eliminates side load and provides for smooth operation. The assembly adapter 60 includes a rotatable sleeve, or gland member, 62 to which the assembly 21 is attached. The sleeve 62 is secured for rotation within a nonrotatable housing member 64 by the seals 66. The air introduced into the chamber B via the passage 69 between the tubular rod 26 and the sleeve 62 is prevented from exiting the assembly 60 by the seals 70 and 71. The end of travel vertical movement of the assembly 21 is monitored by end of travel proximity switch 72 sensing the shoulder extension 74 of the housing 64. The angular contact, adjustable preload bearings 41 and 43 supports rotation of the assembly 21 and linear bearing assembly 24 within the tubular housing 29 in response to the DC servomotor 38. The substantial vertical spacing of the bearings 41 and 43 minimizes horizontal deflections of the quill assembly 21 by increasing its rigidity and providing resistance to side loads encountered during high rates of acceleration deceleration and assembly insertion operations. This enhances the reliability, accuracy and stability of the end effector E. Referring to Figure 3 there is illustrated a sectioned view of the quill 22 slidably positioned within the tubular linear bearing assembly 24. The tubular quill 22 and the tubular linear bearing assembly 24 are coaxially disposed about the tubular rod 26. The quill, which is typically constructed of steel, is illustrated as having a circular ID and a hexagonal OD. The linear bearing assembly 24 is illustrated as consisting of a tubular linear bearing 25 having a hexagonal ID and a circular OD and positioned within a tubular steel tube 27. The tubular linear bearing 25, which is composed of a Teflon impregnated nylon sleeve composition wrapped with fiberglass filament, is commercially available under the tradename Duralon from the Rexnord Bearing Company.The linear bearing composition permits low friction vertical movement of the quill 22 while affording vertical stability to the quill assembly 21 resQ .clng to vertical pneumatic posi tioning from the four way solenoid valve 44. The hexagonal configuration provides rotational stability and essentially serves as a drive key between the quill 22 and the linear bearing 25. It is ob. ols that a similar keying function could be realized through configurations other than the hexagonal embodiment illustrated. The tubular linear bearing 25 is secured against the internal shoulder 29 of the tubular steel member 27, as illustrated in Figure 2, by the retaining ring 31 which is affixed to the tubular member 27 by mounting screws 33.Elastomer rings 35 and 37 positioned at either end of the tubular housing member 27 provide end of travel mechanical stops, or cushions, for the vertical movement of the assembly 21.
