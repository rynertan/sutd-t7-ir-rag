## Abstract
A display surface 2 of the apparatus is divided into a plurality of picture elements each of which is capable of emitting red, green and blue light. Whereas in a conven tional arrangement each picture element contains one light emitting element of each colour, in the present invention each picture element contains one red light emitting ele ment 1R , two green light emitting elements 1G and one blue light emitting element 1B , the red and blue elements being controlled so that they are twice as bright as in the conventional arrangement. In one embodiment, the green elements are arranged in a matrix and are disposed at the corners of squares, with the red and blue elements disposed at centres of the squares throughout the matrix. In another embodiment, the elements are arranged in a plurality of rows, with red and green elements disposed alternately in the odd numbered rows and green and blue elements dis posed alternately in the even numbered rows.
