# Electroplating method.

## Abstract
An electrode in particular an oxygen evolving anode for metal electrowinning from an acid electrolyte comprises a body of aluminium or other metal coated with lead or a lead al loy by electroplating preferably from a non aqueous electro lyte. The substrate can be a sheet of aluminium or compacted particles of aluminium plated with lead or a lead alloy. A sheet of lead or lead alloy is clad to the electroplated substrate and advantageously an electrocatalytic material such as surface activated valve metal sponge is applied to the surface of the lead or lead alloy.
