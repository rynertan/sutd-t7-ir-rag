# Recovery of L phenylalanine and L aspartic acid during preparation of alpha L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester.

## Abstract
In an improved process for recovering L phenylalanine and L aspartic acid from at least one sidestream resulting from the preparation of Î± L asparyl L phenylalanine methyl ester, the sidestream is acidified to afford a first solution containing a salt of L phenylalanine and L aspartic acid, from which solution the salt of L phenylalanine precipitates and is removed. A second solution is formed by dissolving the salt of L phenylalanine in a solvent and the pH of said second solution is then adjusted to precipitate L phenylalanine. The pH of said first solution is adjusted to precipitate L aspartic acid.
