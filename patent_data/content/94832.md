# Improvements relating to electrophotography.

## Abstract
The invention provides a master for use in image transfer by contact printing onto a transparent electropho tographic TEP film, which comprises an electrically insulat ing substrate having a planar surface which carries image elements deposited thereon and a thin transparent insulat ing layer covering said planar surface and said image elements. The surface of the thin transparent insulating material is preferably profiled so that it comprises a base level and raised portions extending above said base level, the area of the raised portions being small compared to the total surface area of the transparent insulating layer. A thin transparent electrode may be incorporated between the substrate and the thin transparent insulating layer. Methods of forming such a master and of contact printing with it are also disclosed.
