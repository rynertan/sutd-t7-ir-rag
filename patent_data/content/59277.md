## Description
RAPID QUANTATIVE TEASUREMENT OF FIBMNOGEN IN BliOOD IiASMA The present invention relates to a method of providing a rapid quantative measurement of the proportion of fibrinogen in a sample of blood plasma. Over the past several years there has been an increasing demand by physicians for estimates to be made of the fibrinogen concentration in the blood plasma of their patients in order to understand their conditions in which the haemostatic system is disturbed. The prime step in the blood coagulation process is the proteolysis by thrombin of circulating fibrinogen. This converts the fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin which is the base material of the blood clot. In any analysis of the propensity of patient s blood to clot a knowledge of this fibrinogen concentration is important. Examples of situations where a coagulation system can be disturbed are in conditions of disseminated intravascular coagulation, some conditions in later pregnancy, during major surgery and in conaitions of thrombosis. Typically, when the patient s condition is changing very quickly the clinician requires accurate details of the patient s coagulation profile in general, and fibrinogen concentration in particular. On many occasions such details are needed quickly, e.g. to assist in the assessment of thrombolytic therapy or in the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation.Thus the routine laboratory needs a technique which has the attributes of speed, simplicity and reliability. The problem as far as fibrinogen is concerned is that there has previously been no technique which will encompass all three of these attributes simultaneously. Known accurate methods of measuring fibrinogen are slow and technically complex and are thus inconvenient for routine use on a large scale. Previous techniques based on the principle of collection of clots formed by thrombin or the method of sulphite precipitation are probably the most accurate but they are technically difficult and very time consuming. An attempt has been made to speed up this type of approach by measuring the rate of change of optical density of a plasma sample while it is clotting but this method still takes about half an hour to complete and is.also particularly unreliable in the large number of cases where fibrinolysis is taking place and fibrinogen degradation products are present. The fastest technique is a fibrinogen titre method but this is at best only semi quantative and gives only a crude estimation of the fibrinogen concentration. Previous chemical techniques such as the use of ammonium or sodium sulphate have the severe defect that they are not specific for fibrinogen. Their use is based on the salting out principle so, because of the presence of other plasma proteins, they are inherently unreliable, especially with abnormal plasma samples where the fibrinogen concentration is low or the gamma globulin proportion is high. The same defect exists in techniques based on a heat precipitation method. Immunological methods are very specific but are the slpwest of all and are therefore of no use in the routine laboratory for fibrinogen measurement. There has been produced a method of estimating fibrinogen in blood plasma in which the weight of precipitate produced on treating a sample bf the plasma with sodium sulphite is measured. While this method gives a more reliable result than the conventional method, when the plasma contains fibrinogen degradation products it is still difficult and time consuming to carry out. This method is therefore unsuitable for frequent routine analysis or for rapid ly estimating the degree of hypo or hyper fibrinogenaemia suffered by a patient, for example, in thrombolytic therapy. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of measuring simply, quickly and with sufficient accuracy the concentration of fibrinogen in a sample of blood plasma and apparatus for performing the method. The concentration of fibrinogen is conveniently expressed in grams litre g l . A method of providing a rapid quantative measurement to an acceptable degree of accuracy of the concentration of fibrinogen in a sample of blood plasma under test according to the invention comprises the steps of forming a substantially homogeneous mixture.of the plasma sample previously treated with an anticoagulent and a to saturated solution of a readily water soluble sulphite, the ratio blood plasma sulphite solution lying in the range from 5 1 to 1 5, then measuring the turbidity optical density , expressed in chosen units, of the plasma sample under test providing at least two reference samples of blood plasma which are identical in physical form with the test sample and cortaining different but known proportions of fibrinogen, measuring and expressing in said chosen units the turbidities of said reference samples so that a particular relationship between fibrinogen concentration and turbidity is determined for these reference samples and then using the measured turbidity of the test sample to obtain the concentration of fibrinogen present in the test sample according to the said particular relationship. he units used for expressing the turbidity are unimportant since it is the numerical value of the ratio of the turbidity of the test sample and of the reference sample which is the factor required. Blood plasmas containing known concentrations of fibrinogen are readily available from commercial sources and a commercial blood plasma may be used for the reference plasma. A reference plasma may, however, be made by choosing a conveniently available sample of blood plasma and measuring its fibrinogen concentration accurately using one of the known accurate but slow techniques. Since the turbidity or optical density of a plasma has been found by the present inventors to bear a linear relationship to the proportion of fibrinogen present in it the proportion of fibrinogen present in the reference plasma does not matter provided it is accurately known. For rapid measurement of the fibrinogen content of a number of plasma samples a graph may be obtained by plotting the numerical values of the concentration of fibrinogen found to be present or known to be present in several plasmas chosen as reference plasmas against the figures obtained for the turbidities of the plasmas, the fibrinogen proportion of each plasma sample under test being obtained directly by reading off the value of fibrinogen proportion on the graph opposite the value of the turbidity of that sample under test. The graph obtained is a straight line. The blood plasma may be centrifuged with the anti coagulent before being mixed with the sulphite solution. The anti coagulent may be a citrate such as sodium citrate or may be heparin. The plasma sample to be tested may be either composed of anti coagulated plasma alone or in aqueous solution. Where the plasma is cloudy, for example lipaemic, the sample may be diluted so that the cloudiness is reduced to an extent such that although it will affect the turbidity reading the amount by which the turbidity reading is affected will have a negligible effect on the value obtained for the proportion of fibrinogen present. Common readily soluble sulphites suitable for use in the method are potassium, sodium, ammonium and magnesium sulphites. The plasma sample to be tested may be mixed with water, the sulphite being then dissolved in the mixture, or preferably, the sulphite is first dissolved in water and then mixed with plasma which is optionally diluted with water. The latter method is particularly preferred because an aqueous solution of the sulphite can be made up accurately in advance and mixed with the plasma sample in accurate doses. If desired, this accurate dosing can be effected using a preformed container containing a predetermined amount of the sulphite solution. This mixing can be carried out automatically if desired. The water used in the method according to the invention is preferably substantially pure, for example deionized or distilled water. The amount of the sulphite aqueous solution. is preferably double that of the mixture containing plasma and water. Aqueous solution of the sulphite preferably contains 8go to a saturated solution, for example, about 10 w v of the sulphite. To ensure the formation of a homogeneous mixture of plasma and sulphite the mixture may be allowed to stand for a period which is variable but preferably 30 seconds to 3 minutes. Apparatus for performing the method of the invention comprises an optical system incorporating a light source and a photoelectric cell, means for holding a sample of blood plasma in a position optically between the light source and the photoelectrical cell, display means arranged to receive the signal from the photoelectric cell and display the reading in chosen units of turbidity and a zeroising control operative to set the display means to indicate zero when a signal representing a particular turbidity is received from the photoelectric cell. The optical system may be a double beam system and there may be two photoelectric cells, two sets of means for holding plasma samples optically between the light source and a respective photoelectric cell and a switching device operable to bring into use a chosen beam system and the associated photoelectric cell. The apparatus may incorporate a stirring means for stirring the plasma mixture and may incorporate timing means capable of regulating the time of stirring and or the time when the mixture is standing after mixing and before the turbidity is measured. The timing means may alternatively or in addition be arranged to stop the means for measuring the turbidity at a chosen interval of time after stirring of the plasma mixture has taken place. The double beam optical system where used may be so arranged that the beam is directed first through one sample and then through the other, the beam after traversing each sample reaching the same photoelectric cell. This eliminates possible errors by different responses of two different photoelectric cells. In the accompanying drawings Fig. 1 is a graph showing readings of fibrinogen content obtained by the method of the invention in comparison with readings obtained by a known very accurate method but one which is slow in operation, Fig. 2 illustrates a calibration graph for the reference plasma showing fibrinogen content plotted against optical density and Fig. 3 shows diagrammatically one form of apparatus for use in performing the invention. In the drawings and referring first to Fig. 1 the horizontal base line represents concentration of fibrinogen represented in g l and the vertical base Tine represents proportions of fibrinogen content obtainea by the method of the invention. It will be. seen that the graph line is a straight line beginning at the origin of the graph and lying at a slope of 1 1. There is almost complete agreement between the figures obtained by the method of the invention and the figures obtained by the known accurate method of determining fibrinogen content. Referring to Fig. 2 the x axis represents optical densities and the y axis represents corresponding values of fibrinogen concentration. The optical density may be indicated in any convenient units, for example attenuation of light intensity. The optical units used do not matter provided they are the same as the units used in obtaining the calibration graph because they are used only for locating the point on the graph for reading off the fibrinogen content of the plasma sample under test. The fibrinogen concentration as indicated by the ordinate is seen to vary linearly as the turbidity or optical density since the graph is a straight line.

In performance of the process a reference sample of blood plasma provides the basis for the calibration graph which is an essential part of the process. This reference plasma may be obtained from one of the producers specializing in the supply of such samples. To obtain the graph such as is illustrated in Fig. 2 it is necessary to make a number of samples having different concentrations of fibrinogen. The easiest method of doing this is to obtain quantities of plasmas having known concentrations of fibrinogen. Alternatively one plasma may be used as a basis to make a number of samples having different concentrations of fibrinogen.One method of doing this is by centrifuging the plasma which had been previously treated with an anticoagulant with a 0.15 molar saline solution or by mixing it with quantities of concentrated fibrinogen solution obtained by extracting the serum from other blood samples. The different samples having different concentrations of fibrinogen can then be examined for fibrinogen content by one of the knownaccurate but slow methods. The length of time it takes to process these samples is not important because calibration is normally a single operation which requires to be performed once only. The figures obtained from the different samples containing different fibrinogen proportion are then plotted to form a graph in which the x axis its divided into units of optical density and the y axis units of fibrinogen concentration. With reference to the graph of Fig. 2 which was obtained by actual experiment the formula of this graph giving the relationship between optical density and fibrinogen concentration is as follows 3.83A 0.05 where 4 is fibrinogen concentration in g l and A is the optical density in any chosen units. The apparatus illustrated in diagrammatic form in Fig. 3 is programmed so that when a signal representing any particular value A is applied to it the indication on the display is the value of as given by the formula for the relevant graph for that applied value of A. The programming of the display device remains constant and where the device of Fig. 3 is to be used it is not necessary once the display device has been programmed to refer further to the actual graph, although it is desirable that at intervals the apparatus should be calibrated against a blood plasma sample of known fibrinogen content to ensure that it is still operating as Qrignally calibrated. Using the apparatus of Fig. 3 the sample of blood plasma of which the fibrinogen content is to be obtained is divided into two equal portions one of which is to be used as a reference sample and the other which will be the test sample and the two portions put into identical cuvettes or test test tubes or other containers which make it possible to pass light through the samples. Bach pbrtion may contain for example 0.5 ml of plasma. Into the cuvette containing the reference sample 1 ml of say 0.9 saline solution is added. This mixture forms the base from which the optical.measurement of the test sample in the other cuvette will be made. The cuvette containing the saline solution and plasma is shaken enough to ensure good mixing and is then placed into the optical measuring section of the apparatus.When the sample is placed in the measuring section the digital display indicates a random reading. The display is then zeroised to form the base referred to above. The blood plasma sample to be tested is placed in the holder in the apparatus. A quantity of dissolved anhydrous sodium sulphite is then added to the sample in the sample holder. Where the sample contains 0.5 ml of plasma the quantity of sodium sulphite may be 1 ml. The stirring device 9 and the timer 6 are then switched on by operating the starting switch 7 and the mixture is stirred until it is substantially homogeneous. It is then left undisturbed to allow the sodium sulphite to bond with the fibrinogen molecules so that the fibrinogen becomes precipitated out of the solution. After 30 seconds the timer 6 operates to hold the display on the display device constant. The figure now displayed on the display device has been subtracted from the original figure obtained from the reference sample and shows the actual fibrinogen content as a direct reading on the display. These may be shown in practical units such as g l. The method may be performed using a simple spectrophotometer or other optical measuring device to provide the comparative readings of turbidity or optical density and the graph to provide the corresponding figures of fibrinogen content but the apparatus described makes performance of the method easier and faster and reduces considerably the possibilities for mistakes.
