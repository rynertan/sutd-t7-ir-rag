# MOTOR ELECTRICAL POSITIONING SYSTEM AND THE APPLICATION THEREOF WITHIN VEHICLE TRACTION DRIVES

## Abstract
A drivetrain 48 for an electric passenger vehicle 10 includes a battery 40 for energizing a single phase A.C. traction motor 18 which drives a ground engaging wheel 12 through a multispeed transaxle 20 . The motor is char acterized by an external ferrite permanent magnet rotor 26 drivingly engaging an input shaft 32 of the transaxle. The motor is controlled by an inverter circuit 44 and a control circuit 46 which generates switch command signals to re ciprocally actuate power transistors 56 and 62 within the inverter circuit as a function of operator demand, rotor posi tion and rotor speed. The control circuit includes a motor positioning circuit 442 which toggles the motor current when the rotor speed falls below a predetermined level to dither the rotor about a park position for a predetermined period. A prestart rotor positioner 224 is provided to mech anically lock the rotor in its park position to ensure the availability of a high electrical starting torque. Finally, a minimum starting speed circuit 599 provides for motor startup from other than normal rotor park position.
