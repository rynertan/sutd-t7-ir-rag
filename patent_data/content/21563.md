## Abstract
A material suitable for thermosetting includes a collection of hollow particles adhesively mixed with a thermosetting resin in such proportions that the mixture exists in a granular form 3 and may be converted by thermosetting into a fused solid mass having a density not greater than 0.5 grams per cubic centimetre. The particles may be glass microbubbles or phenolic microballoons and the resin may be a hardenable Friedel Crafts resin. The material according to the invention is more suitable for packing into shaped cavities eg of 1 than known resins including those containing filler particles.
