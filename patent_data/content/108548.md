# Tamper proof closure and container arrangement.

## Abstract
A tamper proof closure arrangement for a container includes a shrinkable seal 16 applied to seal receiving surfaces 26,40 of the container 12 and closure cap 14 such that the seal is applied internally of the closure cap without removing the closure cap. In a preferred embodi ment, the seal surfaces comprise three dimensional surfaces formed on the container neck and on the closure cap internally of a skirt portion 32 of the cap. The seal is visible through the closure cap such that any attempt at removing the cap irreversibly damages or deforms the seal to provide a visual indication of tampering.
