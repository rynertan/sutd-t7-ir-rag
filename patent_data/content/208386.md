# Silicon valve.

## Abstract
A silicon valve for controlling the flow of a fluid includes two generally planar silicon members 11, 14 . One 14 has an orifice 15 for passing the fluid and the other 11 has a re latively movable surface to selectively open and close the ori fice thereby controlling the flow of fluid through the orifice 15 .
