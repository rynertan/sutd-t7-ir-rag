# Trifocal eye contactlens.

## Abstract
Trifocal eye contactlens consisting of three, mainly concentric parts. A central part correcting the course of lightrays in case of myopia, an outer circular part, correcting the rays in case of presbyopia and between these two parts a circular transitium part, in which the focal distance changes gradually from the value of the central part, to that of the outer part.

## Claims
Claims 1. Eye contactlens, consisting of mainly concentric parts, having mutually different focal distances, characterised in that the lens consists of at least three such parts a central part 4 , confined by the brims of a bowl shaped recess of the inside concave side of the lens a brim part 6 around the periphery of the lens, having at the outside the convex side of the lens a surface with a radius which is smaller than that of the surface of the inner part and having a thickness which from the inside to the outside decreases gradually a part 5 , situated between the central part 4 and the brim part 6 , the surfaces of which, both at the inside and at the outside of the lens connect the surfaces of the central part 4 and the brim part 6 . 2. Eye contactlens according to claim 1, characterised in that, measured in radial direction, the width of the part 5 , situated between the central part 4 and the brim part 6 is 0,3 0,5 mm, preferentially 0,4 mm.

## Description
Trifocal eye contactlensThe invention relates to an eye contactlens, consisting of mainly concentric parts, having mutually different focal distances.Such lenses are well known. For instance lenses are known correcting the course of light rays to the eye in case of presbyopia and having at their convex outer surface a brimpart, ground for correcting rays in case of myopia. The surface of the brim part, being part of the outer surface of the lens, then has a smaller radius than the part of the outer surface it surrounds the central part , while the thickness of that brim part gradually decreases towards the edge of the lens. Also eye contactlenses are known, correcting the course of rays in case of myopia, provided with a bowlshaped recess in the concave innersurface for correction of presbyopia.These known bifocal lenses have disadvantages a sharp image is only obtained for two distance intervals, whereas the transition from far seeing to short seeing is a discontinuous one, which is considered an inconvenience.It has been tried to overcome the said disadvantages by designing multi focal lenses, where the power of the lens changes gradually from the middle part of the lens towards the edge thereof. This however entails the disadvantage, that because of the changing power an optimally sharp image on the retina is never obtained.The eye contactlens according to the invention avoids the disadvantages, both of the bifocal lens and of the multifocal lens. To that end, the eye contactlens according to the invention is characterised in that the lens consists of at least three such parts a central part 4 , confined by the brims of a bowl shaped recess at the inside concave side of the lens a brim part 6 around the periphery of the lens, having at the outside the convex side of the lens a surface with a radius which is smaller than that of the surface of the inner part and having a thickness which from the inside to the outside decreases gradually a part 5 , situated between the central part 4 and the brim part 6 , the surfaces of which, both at the inside and at the outside of the lens connect the surfaces of the central part 4 and the brim part 6 .The brim part and the middle part in most of these lenses are concentric with the central part.Thus it is made possible with one lense, to correct both for presbyopia and for myopia, whereas the part in between procures a good image forming for the distance interval between close by and far off . A further positive contribution is, that it secures the transition from far seeing to short seeing to be a gradual one, thus avoiding the earlier menioned inconvenience for the user. In practise it turned out, that optimal results are obtained if, measured in radial direction, the width of the part, situated between the central part and the brim part is 0,3 0,5 mm, preferentially 0,4 mm.The invention will be further explained by means of the drawing, which by way of example schematically shows a lens according to the invention.Fig. 1 shows how a sharp image is obtained on the retina of the eye by lightrays, reaching the retina via the three parts of the lens and via the eye lens. Fig, 2 shows a front view of and a crosssection through a lens according to the invention.The rays 1, 3 and 2, coming from respectively far away, from close by and from somewhere in between are corrected by the lense parts 4, 6 and 5 such, that via the eye lens 7 and the continued rays 1 , 3 and 2 on the retina a sharp image is obtained.
