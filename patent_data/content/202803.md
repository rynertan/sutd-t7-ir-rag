# Laser curing of coatings and inks.

## Abstract
A method of curing polymer coatings by laser photochemistry in which UV laser irradiation of the coating containing a photoinitiator sensitive to a selected wavelength of the laser light effects a low energy cure of the coatings. The total energy to effect a cure is markedly reduced by applying a series of pulses of the laser light at a low single pulse fluence. A reduction of the single pulse fluence at a constant pulse repetition rate or a reduction of the pulse repetition rate at a constant single pulse fluence tends to further reduce the total energy required to effect a cure of the coating.

## Description
lASER CURING OF COATINGS AND INKS The present invention relates to the curing of coatings and inks, and more particularly to laser curing of such coatings and inks. Clear and pigmented coatings and inks as employed in, say, the printing and painting industries which are susceptible to ultraviolet curing are gaining more acceptance as they can be rapidly cured, require small space for curing, and minimize or eliminate the solvent emitted to the environment. Ultraviolet coatings are typically composed of a liquid or solid polymer and or oligomer and or a monomer, and a photoinitiator. A hydrogen donor such as amines or thiols and their analogues including polymeric analogues are optionally included with the photoinitiator to increase production of radicals used to start the polymer chains. When a photo initiator molecule absorbs a photon of light it can form a radical that combines with a monomer or polymer to start the growth of long chain polymers thereby effecting a cure of the coating or ink.Typical ultraviolet lamp based systems require a fluence of one Joule per square centimetre or greater to ensure cured coatings or films of practical thickness. While the expenditure of such energies leads to practical curing speeds, major advantages are to be gained if the fluence can be reduced so as to allow curing of more film with the same light energy resulting in increased output. Freedom to select the one best wavelength and wavelength bandwidth is also advantageous. Further, when making a thick coating, the surface often cures before the body of the coating, leading to a wrinkling of that coating and poor surface adhesion. At present ovens are used to remove solvents and thus dry and or polymerise conventional solvent or aqueous based coatings. Such ovens occupy considerable space and require relatively large amounts of energy to maintain their temperature as well as the provision of ventilation for the removal of solvent fumes. The desirability of a more even cure rate through the depth of the coating is readily apparent as are the benefits to be gained by reduced fluence to effect photo polymerization. At present, W lamps are used for clear coatings and inks, but ozone, heat removal and non useful wavelengths of light can reduce their effectiveness. So little light from these lamps can penetrate a typical thick pigmented coating that they are not used commercially to any significant extent for this purpose. The present invention proposes to ameliorate the problems associated with prior art systems for curing coatings and inks by the use of ultraviolet laser energy specifically selected to effect the cure of predetermined forms of coatings and inks. In one aspect the present invention consists in a method of curing a coating comprising applying said coating to a surface, said coating comprising a liquid or solid polymer and or oligomer, and or a monomer and at least one photo initiator, and irradiating said coating with ultraviolet laser light of at least one predetermined wavelength, wherein the at least one predetermined wavelength is selected so as to be preferentially absorbed by the at least one photoinitiator rather than the other components of the coating. Where the coating is in the form of a pigmented coating or ink, the coating further comprises a pigment and the at least one predetermined wavelength of said laser light is selected so as to be minimally absorbed by the pigment. A particularly preferred method in accordance with the invention provides that the laser light is applied to the coating by being pulsed. In a further embodiment at least 25 pulses of the laser light are required to effect a cure. In another arrangement at least 50 pulses are required to effect a cure. Desirably, the single pulse fluence of the applied laser light is kept low and preferably 4 3mJ cm2. Advantageously, it has been found that the total energy to effect a cure is very significantly reduced where the single pulse fluence is reduced and the total number of pulses applied to the coating or ink is increased while operating, at a predetermined pulse repetition rate. A further embodiment employs two photo initiators such that each of the two photoinitiators preferentially absorbs a different predetermined wavelength of the laser light so that one photoinitiator is selected for effecting a cure through the coating and the other photoinitiator is selected for effecting a cure at the surface of the coating. Typically, pigmented coatings are of a thickness 0.5 0,5 microns clear coatings have a thickness 2 microns and printing inks have a thickness 6 20 microns. The laser curing process of the present invention requires little or no solvent to be employed in the coating or ink thereby requiring a minimum of space and providing an environmentally acceptable process. Further, the cost of laser curing by the process of the present invention is a fraction of the cost of existing thermal processes and avoids problems associated with air drying.Typical oven drying of pigmented coating requires considerable space and energy to maintain set temperatures, and ventilation facilities to remove the solvent fumes. By means of the present invention pulses of laser light with fluences as low as 0.0001 millijoule cm2 pulse may be used to cure clear polymer coatings. A preferred fluence being 0.002 millijoule cm2 pulse and with an application of 180 pulses. With this fluence, a 100 watt W laser can cure a 1 metre wide film 7 microns thick, moving at a speed of 750 metres2 minute. This may be compared with typical 2 speeds of 80 metres minute for single UV lamp curing 200 300 watt inch lamp intensity over a 1 metre width and typical speeds of 400 metres2 minute for single electron beam curing. By means of low single pulse fluence and multiple pulses an extremely energy efficient through cure of a clear polymer coating can be effected.For low fluence curing one may use Beer s law to select the optimum concentration of the photoinitiator for the coating thickness desired in order to arrive at a cure throughout the thickness of the coating. By means of this invention no more light than is required by the photoinitiator need be used as preferentially no other component of the coating would appreciably absorb at the selected wavelength. This process leads to a markedly lower fluence than is typically used in the cure of coatings and although the cost per photon is higher with a laser than with a lamp, the nett cost of effecting a cure is much lower since so many fewer photons are required to that end. As well the lower fluence required to effect a cure translates to a substantially higher throughput of coated material to be cured than heretofore. In addition the laser source may be placed remote from the coating location since its light output is easily transmitted long distances. Techniques for expanding the beam and making it sufficiently uniform are readily apparent. In the case of pigmented coatings the present invention has been employed in the curing of commercial quality coatings of 20 microns and larger thicknesses with 50 of rutile TiO2 by weight. In this example laser light is used to achieve a through cure of the coating by penetrating the coating at a wavelength of minimum absorption due to the pigment. A photoinitiator is used that absorbs light at this wavelength and whose concentration may be adjusted for maximum energy efficiency. Advantageously, a nitrogen atmosphere is used to counteract oxygen inhibition during the curing process and very short pulses of light, typically of the order of 20 40 nonoseconds, are employed to initiate polymer growth in a particular area of the coating. The use of consecutive pulses of short duration promotes the cure to completion in combination with low fluence of light. It has been found that use of laser light in accordance with the present invention, at 50 TiO2 percent volume 2 concentration has led to a comparable cure with 3 mJ cm J cm2 as compared with 16 J cm2 using a mercury H lamp and the use of the laser allows room temperature curing. This would mean a 100W laser could support a one metre wide belt moving at 50 metres min.Other pigments with absorption at shorter wavelengths in the UV region of the spectrum or in thinner coatings, such as inks, would require less energy cm2 to cure. Examples of components employed in typical coatings suitable for curing by the present invention are as follows.Clear Coatings Typical W laser curable coatings suitable for use in the present invention may be composed of but not limited to the following materials 1. Reactive bligomer s A low molecular weight polymer typically greater than 500 in weight average molecular weight with one or more reactive functionalities to include unsaturated reaction sites, such as but not limited to acrylates or acrylamides or polyester, polyether, alkyd, cellulosics, acrylic, epoxy, silicone polyester, urethanes or any combination thereof. A polyene polythiol type system, or a system such as a cationic initiated type may also be employed. Anionic initiated types may also be employed.2. Reactive Diluent s This component could be mono, di, tri, or polyfunctional and typically would also be a low molecular weight product. Typically 50 500 in weight average molecular weight. 3.

Various additives These are normally used in conventional paint manufacture, for example, flow modifiers.6. Optionally solvent or water. A typical photoinitiator system could preferably include two of the following family groups, as follows 1. Alkyl benzoin ethers as an example, Benzoin ButylEther marketed as EB3 by Fratelli Lamaberti.2.

Others not fitting into categories above 2 methyl I 4 methylthiophenyl 2 morpholinipropanone l from Ciba Geigy, and l Benzoyl cyclohexanol fromCiba Geigy Acylphosphine oxide and analogues 10. Thioxanthones These would include the following 2 and 4 chlorothioxanthone for example CTX by SherwinWilliams.2,4 diethylthioxanthone, for example DETXIsopropylthioxanthone, for example ITX 2,4 dimethylthioxanthone, for example RTX. CTX MDEOAt DETX MDEOA, ITX MDEOA, and RTX MDEOA. MDEOA may be replaced by Ethyl p dimethylaminobenzoate, EPB, and also p dimethylaminoethylbenzoate. Also relevant, amongst others, are DETX analogues, related polymers and amines and aminobenzoatesPigmented coatings Typical W curable coatings for use in the present invention may typically be composed of the materials recited above for clear coating but together with coloured pigments such as TiO2. The photo initiator for titanium dioxide pigment systems typically being CTX MDEOA,DETX MDEOA, ITX MDEOA, and RTX MDEOA. MDEOA may be replaced by Ethyl p dimethylaminobenzoate, EPB, and also p dimethylaminoethylbenzoate.Also relevant, amongst others, are DETX analogues, and Acyl Phosphine oxide and analogues, related polymers and amines and aminobenzoates. In the case of pigmented coatings the photoinitiator concentration may be adjusted to minimise the laser energy per sq. cm at a given concentration of pigment which is required to completely cure the coating. Lasers employed in the practice of the invention may typically have a band width of around 5 nanometers or less centred at the processing wavelength. There is a narrow optimum in wavelength for each combination of pigment and photoinitiator. Doubling the wavelength spread or shifting the wavelength 5 nanometres either side of optimum will increase the energy requirement. It has been found that the use of acylphosphine oxide as the photoinitiator is particularly advantageous and its use results in a hard, well cured coating with good and pure white colour. Wavelengths of W laser between 400 and 450 nm have been successfully employed as rutileTiO2 does not absorb as strongly in that range. As stated previously, other pigments with absorption at shorter wavelengths in the W region of the spectrum or thinner coatings, such as inks, will require less energy cm2 to cure.The corollary is that photoinitiators are preferred where they absorb at those wavelengths where the pigments used have least absorption. Benefits and advantages of the application of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a graph demonstrating the comparison between a laser cure in accordance with the present invention and that as possible with a conventional mercury lamp for a particular photoinitiator Fig. 2 is a graph of energy to cure a clear coating compared with changes in photoinitiator concentration for two different thicknesses of coating Fig. 3 is a graph of energy to cure a clear coating compared with single pulse fluence to achieve that cure with pulses applied at a rate of 250 per second Fig. 4 is a graph of energy to cure a clear coating compared with single pulse fluence at two different pulse repetition rates Fig. 5 is a graph of transmission spectra of TiO2 in a pigmented coating for two different concentrations of TiO2 Fig. 6 is a graph of energy to cure a pigmented coating compared with laser wavelength to effect that cure Fig. 7 is a graph of energy to cure for a pigmented coating compared with laser wavelength wherein the photoinitiator differs from that of Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a graph showing how changes in concentration of two solvents in a dye laser can effect changes in the laser wavelength Fig. 9 is a graph of energy to cure a pigmented coating compared with the thickness of the coating for two different pigment concentrations Fig. 10 is a graph of energy to cure a pigmented coating compared with single pulse fluence with pulses applied at a rate of 250 per second Fig. 11 is a graph of energy to cure a pigmented coating compared with laser pulse repetition rate at a constant wavelength and Fig. 12 is a graph of optimum concentration of a photoinitiator compared with illumination intensity of the laser for effecting a cure of a pigmented coating. Lasers which are typically suited in the operation of the present invention are rare gas halide excimer lasers which have achieved marked improvements in reliability and average power since their development in 1976. Lasers of interest include such as are referenced in SolventDependent Characteristics of XeCl Pumped UV Dye Lasers byCassard, Corkum and Alcock, Appl. Phys. 25,17 22 1981 . The basic principle of laser curing of coatings and inks in accordance with the invention relies on the fact that laser light is substantially monochromatic, so that all the light can be employed to perform useful work. The photoinitiator is chosen to have its maximum activity at the laser wavelength. In Fig. 1 the absorption curve of the photoinitiator trigonal 12 is plotted, with the line showing 100 of the laser light at 308 nm. In contrast, the mercury lamps that are currently used for curing clear coatings have many lines, only a few of which do useful work. For instance, in Fig 1, emissions of wavelengths above 350 nm are poorly absorbed by the photo initiator, and emissions below 270 nm do not penetrate the bulk of the coating. The remaining emissions around 300 nm comprise only 10 of the lamp s output light in the UV region. Fig. 2 demonstrates that very thick 50 150 microns clear coatings may be cured by the laser method.Total laser energy required to cure reaches an optimum for a given concentration of the photoinitiator, DETX. Here and in the following figures, coatings were illuminated by an expanded laser beam in a nitrogen atmosphere until an excellent commercially acceptable cure was obtained. The graph of Fig. 3 shows that a lower fluence a more expanded laser beam leads to a lower energy requirement for cure. The lowest fluence allowable is given by the largest practical area of illumination. This in turn determines the lowest possible total fluence and hence the fastest belt speed at which material may be cured. The slope of these data is well explained by the theory of radical recombination. Fig. 4 demonstrates that at a given single pulse fluence, one finds that going to higher pulse repetition rate degrades performance. By going to lower single pulse fluence, some of this loss may be recovered. For maximum belt speed, the laser is run at its maximum repetition rate. Fig. 5 demonstrates that ultraviolet curing of coatings containing TiO2 i.e. opaque paints must be done at longer wavelength than the absorption edge ofTiO2 shown here at 400 to 410 nm . At shorter wavelength, the light is all absorbed before reaching the bottom of the coating. The theoretical curing speed can be considered to be proportional to the intensity of light reaching the bottom of the coating. The experimental curve of Fig. 6 for the energy to cure vs. wavelength shows a very sharp optimum for the photoinitiator DETX. The illuminating wavelength should preferably be 422 5 nm. There was 50 Rutile in a 20 micron coating, providing a sufficiently opaque paint for commercial use. Fig. 7 shows that for another photoinitiator,Acylphosphine oxide, a similarly narrow curing range is found, 413 3 nm. At the present time only a dye laser has the narrowband, tunable radiation needed to cure these pigmented coatings. The dye laser output was measured forPopop dye in cyclohexane dioxane. Using various solvents, the dye Popop can be made to lase at many wavelengths see Fig. 8 , including the optimum ones for DETX and acylphosphine oxide APO pigmented coatings with TiO2. Using different dyes, the dye laser can be made to lase from 330 to 1000 nm with about 25 watts of power assuming an input beam of 100 watts at 308 nm . Fig. 9 demonstrates that the dye laser method is able to cure thick up to 60 microns pigmented coatings, with different loadings of TiO2. As with clear coatings, going to lower intensity illumination of pigmented coatings gives a faster cure rate less total energy to cure and more efficient use of light . In the plot of Fig. 10 two laser wavelengths were used, 308 and 415 nm. The 308 nm light increases the rate of surface cure. As shown by Fig. 11 higher repetition rates of the laser lead to less efficient cure for pigmented coatings as with clear ones . The optimum photoinitiator, e.g., acylphosphine oxide, concentration changes with illumination intensity as shown in the plot of Fig. 12. Fortunately, low fluence is associated with both faster cure speeds and lower photoinitiator concentration, which means lower costs. Examples of cures achieved by operating in accordance with the invention will now be described in relation to inks, clear coatings and pigmented coatings.Inks Inks employed in these examples carry the trade name Viodri as marketed by Coates Brothers Australia Pty.Ltd., their exact composition is unknown. However, Coates literature says they contain polyfunctional acrylate esters and photoinitiators such as benzophenone. The inks were spread with a rubber printer s roller onto paperboard to a thickness estimated at 3 5 microns. They were cured quickly so as to reduce soaking into the paper. Curing took place under a nitrogen atmosphere and illumination by excimer laser light at 308 nm, 250 pulses per second for red and yellow inks and 415nm for black and blue inks, and a single pulse fluence of 1 mJ cm2. A scratch test was used to determine a successful cure, and the minimum total energy to cure was noted.

Examples of formulations of coatings and their manner of application and curing will now be described.Example I A typical mix of ingredients for a clear coating in accordance with the invention comprises the following by weight 56.4 epoxy acrylate oligomer 51 650 of A.C.Hatrick Chemicals Pty. Limited A.C.H. 37.6 H.D.O.D.A.hexane diol diacrylate A.C.H. 3 Trigonal 12 phenyl benzophenone AKZO Chemicals and 3 MDEOA methyl diethanol amine Union Carbide . This mixture was applied wet to a thickness of 7 m by draw down bars and was cured under a nitrogen blanket with a single pulse fluence of 0.0065 millijoules cm2.The total energy required to cure was 0.9 mJ cm2 and the state of cure was assessed by measuring hardness of the coating via a scratch test. The substrate to which the coating was applied was high quality low porosity white paper. The wet sample coating having dimensions of 10cm x 5cm was irradiated by a laser beam of dimensions 15cm x 15cm. The results of this static test when extrapolated to a dynamic environment equate to a belt travelling at 667 metres min, the belt being 1 metre wide and the illuminated area being 1 x 3m2.

The wet coating was applied to a thickness of 58 m with a draw down bar and the same substrate was employed as for Example I but the single pulse fluence applied was 0.00015 millijoules cm2 and the total energy to cure was 0.29 mJ cm2. The equivalent belt speed in this case is 2069 m min for the same area of illumination as in Example I.Example III A pigmented coating was produced by curing a mixture of the following ingredients combined in weight percentages as follows 61 of a 60 40 mixture of epoxy acrylate oligomer ACH 51 650 and H.D.O.D.A.

The same application conditions were employed as forExamples I and II to a wet thickness of coating of 35 m.Two wavelengths of radiation were employed, the first being 308nm at a single pulse fluence of 0.0015 mJ cm2 and the second being 415 nm at a single pulse fluence of 0.0025 mJ cm2. The total energy to cure was 1.4mJ cm2 for the 308 nm radiation and 2.6 mJ cm2 for the 415 nm radiation. The equivalent belt speed in this case using an 2 illuminated area of 1 x 3m2 is 50 m min. The advantages flowing from the application of the present invention will be apparent to the addressee and in the case of pigmented coatings, not to mention clear coatings, there is the application of coatings on paper, timber, furniture, metal cans, flat metal plates, steel and aluminium coil, interior and exterior of automobiles, component parts, plastic parts etc.
