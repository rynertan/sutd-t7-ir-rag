# Apparatus for cooling a work roll in a rolling mill for rolling metal strip.

## Abstract
Apparatus for cooling a work roll 11 in a rolling mill for rolling metal strip, has a plurality of sprays 1 7 ar ranged in a row extending in the longitudinal direction of the work roll, the sprays spraying water onto the work roll surface in a manner such that the surface of contact 17 of the cooling water of each spray on the work roll surface is oblong in shape and the longitudinal axes of the said sur faces of contact form an angle to a describing line 18 on the work roll surface. To improve cooling, particularly re moval of cooling water from the roll, there are a plurality of said rows of sprays 1 5, 6 and 7 closely spaced in the peripheral direction of the work roll and at least some of the sprays in at least two consecutive rows in the peripheral direction of the work roll are arranged so that the longitudi nal axes of the surfaces of contact 17 of the sprays in a first such row form an acute angle α to a first describing line on the work roll surface, and the longitudinal axes of the con tact surfaces of the sprays in the second such row form an obtuse angle β to a second describing line, whereby the surfaces of contact form a herringbone pattern.
