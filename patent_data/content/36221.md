## Description
Photosensitive material and a process for reproducing photo information The present invention relates to a photosensitive material and a process for the reproducing of photoinformation. More particularly the present invention relates to reprographic materials comprising a photosensitive layer suitable for producing a photoresist on a wash off removable non photosensitive coloured layer. Basically, a photo resist system is one in which a photosensitive layer applied on a support or base is information wise exposed e.g. through a master image or pattern so that a change in solubility of that layer takes place and the more soluble parts can be removed selectively with a proper solvent. The photosensitive layer for forming the photoresist image can be coloured to form visible indicia but such at the expense of the photosensitivity. According to the United Kingdom Patent Specification 1,291,960 there is provided a light sensitive material comprising a translucent base, carrying thereon pigment, a light sensitive substance and a pressure sensitive adhesive. More particularly in example 2 of said specification a translucent film base was first coated with a coloured coating containing gelatin, methylene blue and microcapsules of adhesive. Thereon a light sensitive coating was applied containing benzoquinone 1 2 diazide 2 4 N N diphenyl sulphonamide and alkali soluble phenolformaldehyde novolak resin. After exposure to light under a positive master the exposed portions of the two coatings were removed by washing with a 3 by weight aqueous solution of sodium phosphate. Convenient imaging systems coatings for forming wash off patterns should have the property of automatic wash off processability in wash off machines. Such brings about that where materials with separate photosensitive coatings and coloured coatings are used these coatings in the photo exposed or non photo exposed area, according to the type of resist used, should be capable of being removed with the same solvent and at comparable speed for both coatings. It has been determined experimentally that coloured gelatin coatings are not sufficiently rapidly removable in moderately alkaline aqueous processing liquids at room temperature 200 0 and therefore a search was made for a more appropriate substitute. According to the United Kingdom Patent Specification 1,385,241 a composite photosensitive element suited for the production of graphic art masks is provided which element comprises a a photosensitive layer comprising either i a photohardenable material which hardens upon exposure to actinic radiation or ii a crosslinkable photosensitive composition which undergoes decomposition upon exposure to actinic radiation to leave material in the unexposed areas which crosslinks and hardens upon treatment with a basic crosslinking agent and in intimate surface contact therewith, b a layer of a solvent soluble, macromolecular organic polymer layer which layer b contains at least one dye or pigment and is essentially opaque to ultraviolet radiation and essentially transparent to visible actinic radiation.In practice said layer b contains known ultra violet radiation absorbing agents such as 2, 3 dihydroxybenzophenone and 2,2 dihydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone but also yellow or orange dyes. By the term solvent soluble is meant in said last mentioned United Kingdom Patent Specification that the polymer of layer b should be soluble in a solvent used to develop the element a which has been exposed imagewise by dissolving and removing unhardened material in the unexposed or exposed areas of layer a while not dissolving hardened material in the remaining areas of layer a . In the Examples of the last mentioned United Kingdom Patent Specification either organic solvents are used or mixtures of organic solvents with water for developing the composite photosensitive elements. As useful polymeric binders for the ultraviolet radication absorbing layer are described e.g. a copolymer made from 90 mole of methyl methacrylate and 10 mole of methacrylic acid and a 15 acrylic hydrosol in water which is a terpolymer made from 55 of methyl methacrylate, 40 of ethyl acrylate and 5 of acrylic acid. If possible the use of expensive and inflammable solvents that are polluting the waste water should be avoided. Therefore in accordance with the present invention photosensitive recording materials are provided that are developable with alkaline aqueous liquids free from organic solvents. More particularly in accordance with the present invention a photosensitive recording material is provided which comprises on a support 1 a photosensitive recording layer capable of obtaining in the photo exposed area a selective increase or de crease of solubility in an alkaline aqueous liquid so that it can yield a negative or positive resist pattern by wash off treatment with an aqueous alka line liquid, 2 subjacent to said photosensitive layer and in water permeable relationship therewith a dyed and or pig mented alkali soluble non photosensitive binder layer, characterized in that said non photosensitive layer comprises in a proportion of at least 50 by weight with respect to the dye s and or pigment s a non gelatinaceous binder being a binding agent or mixture of binding agents containing free carboxylic acid groups in such a degree that it has a total acid number between 90 and 350, the non photosensi tive binder layer being not soluble in pure water at 2000 but soluble in a 0.5 by weight aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 200 C. By total acid number is understood the quantity of base, expressed in milligrams of potassium hydroxide, that is required to neutralize all acidic constituents in 1 g of sample ref. ASIM D 664 58 . The binding agent or mixture of binding agents has preferably a total acid number in the range of 90 to 300. In the photoresist field two types of compositions are considered. The negative acting photoresist compositions that are rendered insoluble in the exposed areas and the positive acting photoresist compositions that become more soluble in the exposed parts. A survey of both types of photoresist materials is given by W.S. De Forest in his book Photoresist materials and processes , Me Graw Hill Book Company 1975 . Particulars about photosensitive compounds improving the solubility of a recording layer are described under the heading Diazo Relief Images by Kurt I. Jacobson Ralph E.Jacobson in their book Imaging Systems The FocalPress London and New York 1976 173 179. A recent survey of photoactive catalysts used in light induced photocuring of coating systems is given by Vincent D. Me Ginniss in Phot.Sc. Eng. Vol. 23, n 3, Nay june 1979 124 136. In the production of positive photoresists suitable for use according to the present invention photosensitive compounds are used which improve on photoexposure the alkali solubility of the photosensitive layer. Photosensitive o quinone diazides are preferred for that purpose. In the photolysis of o quinone diazides nitrogen is eliminated and a reactive ketocarbene radical is formed. The ketocarbene radical undergoes a Wolff type rearrangement and gives a ketene derivative which on reacting with water forms an indene carboxylic acid which enhances the solubility in alkaline aqueous medium of the recording layer see Unconventional ImagingProcesses by Eric Brinckman et al., The Focal PressLondon and New York 1978 , 65 672. Particularly useful are the naphthoquinone 1,2 diazides 2 the preparation of which is described e.g.in Beilstein, Handbuch der organischen Chemie 4th Ed., vol. 15 1933 , page 533. For application in the present invention said naphthoquinone 1,2 diazides 2 may be substituted e.g. with halogen, an aryl group including a substituted aryl group, a chlorosulphonyl group, a fluorosulphonyl group, an ester group e.g. an aryl carboxylate group or an aryl sulphonate group including said groups in substituted form, a sulphonamide group or a N arylsulphonamide group. Representatives of particularly useful substituted naphthoquinone 1,2 diazide 2 compounds correspond, e.g., to one of the following general formulae I and 11 EMI5.1 EMI6.1 wherein R2 represents fluorine, chlorine, an aryl group including a substituted aryl group, an aryloxy group including a substituted aryloxy group or an arylamino group including a substituted arylamino group, andR3 represents fluorine or an aryloxy group including a substituted aryloxy group. Compounds according to at least one of said general formulae are described in the United States Patent Specifications 3,046,120 3,046,121 3,666,473, theUnited Kingdom Patent Specifications 941,837 937,121 1,350,773 1,127,996 and 1,116,674 and the publishedGerman Patent Applications DT OS 2,457,895 2,208,699 and 1,124,817. Most preferred for use according to the present invention are the naphthoquinone 1,2 diazide 2 compounds of general formula I wherein R2 is an aryloxy group. These compounds are prepared by well known methods of chemical synthesis, e.g. by making to react the corresponding sulphonic acid chloride of 2 diazonaphthol 1 with the elected aromatic hydroxy compound as described e.g. in the United States Patent Specification 3,046,121. Generally speaking the bigger the molecules of the aromatic hydroxy compounds condensed with the diazonaphthol sulphonic acid chloride are, the better the phototransformation proceeds. The naphthoquinone 1 ,2 diazide 2 5 sulphonic acid ester of 2,3,4 trihydroxybenzophenone described in the published German Patent Application 2,410,880 is particularly useful for the purpose of the present invention. Said diazide compound has the following structural formula A EMI7.1 Sensitivity maxima at wavelength i 1 349 nm A2 401 nm A3 420 nm Another particularly useful diazide compound is naphthoquinone 1 , 2 diazide 2 5 sulphonyl fluoride, which is described in the United Kingdom Patent Specification 1,116,674 and has the following structural formula B EMI7.2 Sensitivity maxima at wavelengthEMI7.3 Another group of photosensitive alkali solubility improving compounds suitable for use in the present invention are diazosulphone compounds containing the group S02 N N . The production of positive photoresists with such compounds is described in the United States PatentSpecification 3,847,610.Preferred compounds are represented by one of the following general formulae X S02 N N Y andX S02 N N Z N N S02 X1 wherein X represents phenyl, naphthyl, or phenyl substituted in ortho, meta or para position with respect to the sul phonyl group by alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, carboxyl, amino, dialkylamino wherein the alkyl groups comprise 1 to 4 carbon atoms, acylamino wherein the acyl group comprises 2 to 7 carbon atoms, phenylazo or nitro phenylazo 71 represents phenyl, aminophenyl or alkylphenyl wherein the alkyl group comprises 1 to 4 carbon atomsY represents pyridyl, anthraquinonyl, naphthyl, acri dinyl, benzothiazolyl or a group of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, nitro, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, carboxyl or sodium sulphonyl or NR R wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenyl, acyl wherein the acyl group comprises 2 to 7 carbon atoms, p methoxybenzoyl, p nitrophenyl, naphthyl, acryloyl, methacryloyl or dialkyl aminophenylc arb amoyl with alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms Rl is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or phenylR2 represents hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy with 1 or 2 carbon atoms, alkyl of 1 or 2 carbon atoms, or nitro R3 represents hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy with 1 or 2 carbon atoms, or alkyl of 1 or 2 carbon atomsR1, R2 and R3 are standing in ortho, meta or para position, andZ represents a group of the formulae EMI9.1 Examples of diazosulphone compounds within the scope of these formulae are listed here in Table 1. Table 1 1 phenylsulphonyl p tolyl diimide 2 phenylsulphonyl p carboxyphenyl diimide 3 phenylsulphonyl p nitrophenyl diimide 4 phenylsulphonyl p methoxyphenyl diimide 5 phenylsulphonyl p sulphophen diimide sodium salt 6 p tolylsulphonyl 4 pyridyl diimide 7 p tolylsulphonyl 9 acridinyl diimide 8 p tolylsulphonyl 2 benzothiazolyl diimide 9 p tolylsulphonyl 1 naphthyl diimide 10 p acetamidophenylsulphonyl p diethylaminophenyl diimide 11 p acetamidophenylsulphonyl 4 benzamido 2,5 di ethox rphenyl diimide 12 p dimethylaminophenylsulphonyl p nitrophenyl diimide 13 p dimethylaminophenylsulphonyl p diethylamino phenyl diimide 14 1 naphthylsulphonyl p tolyl diimide 15 3,3 dimethyl 4 ,4 bis p aminophenylsulphonylazo biphenyl 16 2,5 bisE4 p tolylsulphonylazo phenyl oxazole 17 4 p tolylsulphonylazo azobenzene 18 1 ,4 dimethoxy 2 p nitrophenylazo 5 p tolylsulphonyl azo benzene 19 4,4 bis p tolylsulphonylazo diphenylamine 20 4,4 bis phenylsulphonylazo 2,2 stilbene disulphonic acid disodium salt. They are easily synthetised starting from diazonium salts and sulphinic acids. An increase in the rate of photodissociation yielding an alkali soluble compound starting from the diazosulphone compounds can be obtained by adding sensitizing dyes taken from the class of acridine, phenazine, thiazine and xanthene dyes, e.g. methylene blue, benzoflavine, thionine and erythrosine, in a concentration of 0.001 to 0.1 by weight based on the diazosulphone compound. Examples of moderately alkali soluble polymers suited for use according to the present invention in admixture with the above photoradical producing compounds increasing the alkali solubility of the photosensitive layer after photo exposure, belong to the class of copolymers of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, and citraconic acid. If the copolymer comprises an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, the half esters and half amides thereof may be used too.These unsaturated carboxylic acids are copolymerised with ethylenically unsaturated compounds, which are substantially insoluble in alkaline medium and which are present in the copolymer in such a proportion that the copolymer itself remains moderately soluble in alkaline medium. Ethylenically unsaturated compounds that can be used for the copolymerisation are styrene and the derivatives thereof, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, acrylates, methacrylates, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile e.g. copoly ethylene maleic acid and copoly methacrylic acid methyl methacrylate . Particularly suitable polymers for use in admixture with said naphthoquinone 1,2 diazide 2 compounds are condensates of formaldehyde with phenol, which condensates are known as novolaks . According to Fred W.Billmeyer in the Textbook ofPolymer Chemistry Interscience Publishers, Inc. NewYork 1967 p. 350 novolaks are produced in acid solution by reaction of a high ratio of phenol to formaldehyde yielding a linear, soluble ,fusible polymer having the structure EMI11.1 where ortho and para links occur at random. Molecular weights may range as high as 1000, corresponding to about ten phenyl groups. These materials do not themselves react further to give crosslinked resins. Further information about the preparation of novolaks can be found in C.Ellis The Chemistry of Synthetic Resins Volume 1 1935 , Reinbold Publishing Corp., New York, p. 303 309. Good results are further obtained with condensates of formaldehyde with phenol or m cresol, reacted with chloroacetic acid. Likewise suited is a cellulose acetate phthalate having a degree of acetyl substitution D.S. acetyl between 1.0 and 1.7 panda degree of phthalyl substitution I .S. phthalyl between 0.6 and 1. 2. The proportions of alkali soluble polymer s and of photosensitive o quinone diazide compound s are preferably comprised between 1 1 and 7 1 by weight. In the production of negative photoresists suitable for use according to the present invention photosensitive compounds are used which reduce on photoexposure the alkali solubility of the photosensitive layer. For that purpose a large variety of photoradical forming compounds can be used which induce polymerization or cross linking of ethylenically unsaturated compounds that initially were alkali soluble. A non limitative survey of photoradical forming compounds also called photoinitiators is given by Blurt I. Jacobson Ralph E. Jacobson in the book Imaging Systems The Focal Press London and New York 1976 pages 181 198. Particularly useful photoinitiators for use according to the present invention in the production of a negative photoresist are described in the United States Patents 3,501,296 and 3,558,309. Preferred are the 0 acylated oximinoketones also called oxime ester photopolymerisation initiators the photolysis of which is presented in the Encyclopedia ofPolymer Science and Technology, Supplement Vol. 1 1976 John Wiley Sons, Inc. p. 435. These oxime esters contain at least one oxime ester group of the following structure EMI13.1 wherein R is an organic group. Specific oxime esters which can be used as photopolymerisation initiator are within the scope of the following general formulae EMI13.2 wherein H4 represents an alkyl group comprising 1 or 2 carbon atoms, an aryl group, an alkaryl group, an aralkyl group, a hydroxy substituted aralkyl group, or an acyl group including a substituted acyl group,R5 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group comprising 1 or 2 carbon atoms, an aryl group, or an acyl group including a substituted acyl group, and or wherein H and H5 together represent the necessary atoms to form with the adjacent carbon atom a cyclo alkyl group, a phenanthrone group, or an indanone group, R6 represents an acyl group including a substituted acyl group, and R7 represents a diacyl group. 4 Preferably at least one of R and R5 is an acyl group including a substituted acyl group. The acyl groups for R4 R5 and H6 are preferably acyl groups derived from aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulphonic acids e.g. benzoyl, phenylsulphonyl, naphthoyl, anthraquinonyl carbonyl, acetyl, propionyl, phenylacetyl, cinnamoyl, alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl and N substituted carbamoyl e.g. N phenylcarbamoyl. Particularly useful are the following oxime esters of Table 2.Table 2EMI14.1 The photosensitivity of the oxime ester photoinitiator compounds can be activated by suitable sensitizers as described e.g. in the European Patent Applications 79200429.3 and 80200033.1. Particularly suitable sensitizers are Michler s ketone and carbostyril compounds e.g. the followingEMI14.2 A photosensitive recording layer for the production of a negative photoresist suitable for use according to the present invention preferably comprises the photoinitiator in admixture with at least one polymerizable unsaturated carbon compound and an alkali soluble binding agent. Preferred polymerizable unsaturated compounds have more than one carbon to carbon double bond, e.g.two terminal vinyl groups or are polymeric compounds having ethylenic unsaturation. During photopolymerisation cross linking will usually occur by means of the plurally unsaturated compound.Examples of such polymeric compounds containing ethylenically unsaturation are, e.g., allyl esters of polyacrylic acid, maleic esters of polyvinyl alcohol, polyhydrocarbons still containing carbon to carbon double bonds, unsaturated polyesters, cellulose acetomaleates, and allylcellulose. Preferred photosensitive layers for negative resist formation comprise as plurally unsaturated photopolymerisable compounds the following divinylbenzene, diglycol diacrylates,N,N alkylene bis acrylamides, triethyleneglycol diacrylate, triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, bisphenol A diacrylate. Suitable alkali soluble binding agents for the negative resist forming layer are polymers and copolymers containing sufficient units of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and crotonic acid, unsaturated dicarboxylic acids e.g. maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, and citraconic acid as well as half esters and half amides of these dicarboxylic acids. These unsaturated carboxylic acids are copolymerised with ethylenically unsaturated c ompounds, which are substantially insoluble in alkaline medium and which are present in the copolymer in such a proportion that the copolymer itself remains soluble in alkaline medium.Ethylenically unsaturated compounds that can be used for the copolymerisation are styrene and derivatives thereof, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, acrylates, methacrylates, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile e.g. copoly ethylene maleic acid and copoly methylmethacrylate methacrylic acid . Especially suitable are the alkali soluble copolymers of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid wherein the ratio by weight between the monomeric units is between 90 10 and 75 25, more preferably between 85 15 and 80 20, and wherein the intrinsic viscosity of the copolymers measured in tetrahydrofuran at 2000 is between 0.05 and 0.20 dl g, corresponding to molecular weights of about 7000 to 40,000. These alkali soluble copolymers of methylmethacrylate and methacrylic acid combine easy removability of the nonexposed portions with good mechanical strength i.e.resistance to abrasion of the exposed portions. The proportions in the negative resist forming layer of binding agent and of photopolymerisable compound are preferably such that an exposure of said layer to actinic radiation of maximum 1 minute can effect at room temperature 200 C a decrease in solubility of the exposed parts such that these parts do not dissolve in an aqueous solution 2000 of 0.5 to 5 S by weight of sodium hydroxide within 20 seconds. Weight ratios of alkali soluble polymer to photopolymerisable compound between 1 2 and 5 1 are preferred. Good results are obtained with 0.5 5 by weight of sensitizer and 2.5 10 96 by weight of oxime ester, preferably 1.5 5 by weight of sensitizer and 5 10 96 by weight of oxime ester, based on the total weight of alkali soluble binding agent and polymerisable compound. Suitable photoinitiators for negative resist formation are further the nitrones described in the published GermanPatent Application 2,723,613 which has to be read in conjunction herewith. Suitable photosensitive compositions containing a mixture of nitrones and of naphthoquinone 1,2 diazide compounds for forming a negative or positive resist depending on the exposure intensity are described in the published German Patent Application 2,810,463. The binding agent or mixture of binding agents of the dyed and or pigmented non photosensitive layer is selected preferably in such a way that it is not or only poorly at most 10 96 by weight at 2000 soluble in the solvent wherefrom the photosensitive layer is coated. Waterinsoluble but alkali soluble binding agents having free carboxylic acid groups are preferred e.g. prepared as a latex by addition polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated acids in combination with one or more other non acidic ethylenically unsaturated compounds in order to bring the total acid number of the final polymer in the range of 60 to 350. Suitable water insoluble but alkalisoluble binding agents are described in the United Kingdom Patent 1,338,900 and in the United States Patent 3,262,782.Particularly suitable binding agents are copolymers of an alkyl meth acrylate and meth acrylic acid wherein the meth acrylic acid content is preferably in the range of 20 to 50 by weight. The binder of the non photosensitive layer may be applied from a solution in an organic solvent but is preferably applied from an aqueous dispersion latex . The substance providing a colour to the non photosensitive layer may be a dye homogeneously dissolved in the binder of that layer or a pigment dispersed therein. When dyes are used they are preferably nonmigratory. Preference is given to pigments, that are water and alkali insoluble to prevent staining of the remaining resist parts. Non migratory dyes also known as organic pigment dyes are very useful particularly those sold under the trade marks PIGMOEiOL and COLANYI which are trade marks of Badiache Anilin Soda Fabrik A.G. Sudwigs hafen Rh., W.Germany. Examples thereof are HANSAYELLOW G30 COIANYI C.I.11,680 LITHOLSCHAIIA0H BSN PIGNOSOL trade mark known also as PIGMENT HEl 48 C.I. 15,865 and HELIOGEN BLIIU B COLANYL TEIG and EERSIENT GELB NCG COLANYL TEIG also known as Pigment Yellow 16 0.1. 20,040 . When a black colour is required preference is given to carbon black. To obtain a metallic luster dispersed metals e.g. colloidal aluminium particles can be used as pigments. In order to obtain fluorescent or phosphorescent panels e.g. useful in advertising the non photosensitive coating may contain fluorescent or phosphorescent dyes or pigments to form visibly detectable indicia. The dyes and or pigments are mostly used with respect to the binding agent or binding agent mixture of the non photosensitive layer in a weight ratio range of 1 10 to 1 1. The support of the photosensitive recording material may be any type of solid plate sheet or belt material but is preferably a flexible resin material e.g. a cellulose nitrate film, cellulose acetate film, poly vinyl acetal film, polystyrene film, polyester film e.g.poly ethylene terephthalate film, polycarbonate film, a film made of poly alpha olefins such as a polyethylene or a polypropylene, and special purpose films such as a drawing film e.g. of the type described in the UnitedStates Patent Specifications 3,115,420 of John M.Centa,Albert L.Van Stappen and Louis F.Vogt Jr., issuedDecember 24, 1963 and 3,627,563 of Raymond S.Richards, issued December 14, 1971. The support is usually 0.05 to 0.15 mm in thickness. If the support is made of a transparent resin or glass reprographic transparencies can be made that may be used for making contact copies or projected, e.g.with an overhead projector. If the support is an opaque material e.g. baryta or alpha olefin coated paper, opaque colour proofs can be made by washing off. If the support is made of metal, the resist with underlying coloured layer parts may be used as etch resist the pattern of which can be easily visibly inspected before starting the etching. It is also contemplated that the support may contain dyes or pigments e.g. white or fluorescent or phosphorescent dyes or pigments and the remaining pattern of the non photosensitive layer acts as an opaque shield so that the uncovered i.e. the bared parts of the support form the indicia. When the support contains phosphorescent particles they have to be previously exposed to light.In the case where the base is fluorescent the uncovered parts forming the indicia would have to be activated with ultraviolet radiation or X rays. Furthermore the support may have a composite structure e.g. includes a layer s that impart s to it a coloured or light reflecting property e.g. includes a vacuum coated light reflective metal layer e.g. aluminium layer or includes a binder coating containing partially embedded small spheres about 0.004 inch diameter of glass glass beads which will reflect ambient light in a rather small angle about 150 as is known from a glass beaded projection screen. The support may at its rearside be provided with a pressure sensitive adhesive layer covered with a peel off sheet or ribbon so that after processing the resulting material can be sticked to any other permanent support for lay out or mounting. The photosensitive recording materials according to the present invention are prepared by coating the ingredients forming the photosensitive layer to the selected support already coated with the non photosensitive dyed or pigmented layer by a known coating technique, e.g.by spin coating, whirl coating, spraying, dip coating, roller coating, air knife coating, doctor blade coating, etc. The coating composition of the photosensitive layer as well as of the non photosensitive layer may comprise besides the ingredients referred to hereinbefore matting agents e.g. silica particles in association with ureaformaldehyde resin, polymethylmethacrylate particles, etc., antistatic agents, coating aids, wetting agents, e.g. anionic and cationic surface active agents, silicon oils, etc. For forming the coating composition of the photosensitive layer preferably a solution in an organic solvent s is are used. A low boiling solvent, e.g.acetone, is preferred since after the coating step it can be easily removed by evaporation. The thickness of the dried photosensitive recording layer and of the non photosensitive dyed and or pigmented layer may be in the range of 0.5 to 20 llm, and is preferably between 1 and 5 pm. The process of the present invention for the reproducing of photo information comprises the steps of 1 information wise photo exposing the photosensitive layer of the above described photosensitive material to selectively increase or reduce the alkali solubility of said layer in the exposed area, 2 treating the photo exposed layer with an aqueous alkaline liquid free from organic solvents to easy the removal of the more soluble parts of the photosensitive layer and also of the portions of the above described non photosensitive layer, that are underlying the more soluble portions of the photosensitive layer and 3 smooth rubbing and rinsing with water to effect the wash off of said parts and portions. The alkalinity of the alkaline aqueous liquid is preferably not higher than is obtained in a 3 by weight aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 2000. The processing of the photo exposed recording materials of the present invention is advantageously carried out in an automatic processing apparatus, in which the material is transported automatically through processing stations in which the removal of the still soluble portions of the photosensitive layer and of the underlying dyed and or pigmented non photosensitive layer portions take place in successive stations. For example in a particularly suitable processing apparatus for use in the production of reprographic images e.g. carbon black images produced according to the present invention, a first station comprises a tray for holding an appropriate alkaline aqueous liquid, through which the exposed recording material is transported.After the alkaline development stage the surplus alkaline liquid absorbed in and adhering to the material is removed by passing the developed material through a second tray filled with plain water, whereupon the material is smoothly rubbed with a wet sponge roller rotating in a third tray filled with water wash off station whereupon the processing is completed by carrying the material through a fourth tray containing plain water for rinsing the material. Processing preferably proceeds at room temperature about 18 to about 2500 but may proceed at higher temperatures. Care must be taken, however, not to damage the resist portions of the photosensitive layer. The alkaline developing station and the wash off station can be arranged separately but preferably they are grouped in a compact unit, in which the recording material is carried automatically at a constant speed from the alkaline developing tray into the other trays. The total processing for the formation of the images in said trays normally lasts but about 30 seconds at 20 30O0. Taken with the speed of the photosensitive layer requiring exposure times in the order of a few seconds the present invention provides a rapid, highly reliable and convenient method for the formation of reprographic images. The present invention makes it possible to produce dye or pigment images with very high contrast and excellent resolution at low cost. Mass production of line and half tone images with high screen dot quality in a simple manner at high speed is made possible in a simple inexpensive equipment at low unit cost. The synthesis of suitable alkali soluble polymeric binding agents is exemplified in the following prepara tions Preparation 1 The following solution was formed methyl methacrylate 40 g methacrylic acid 10 g 4,4 azo bis 4 cyanovaleric acid 1.5 g methanol 500 ml This solution was refluxed for 24 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere while continuously stirring. After cooling the solution was poured into water. The white, powdery precipitate was isolated and was dried under vacuum.Yield 45 g of co methyl methacrylate methacrylic acid , having an intrinsic viscosity in tetrahydrofuran 200 C of 0.155 dl g. The copolymer comprised 18.4 by weight of methacrylic acid units. Total acid number 120.Preparation 2 A solution of 800 g of methyl methacrylate, 200 g of methacrylic acid and 30 g of 4,4 azo bis 4 cyanovaleric acid in 10 1 of acetone was refluxed for 24 hours while stirring under nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling a solution was obtained having a viscosity of 1.25 mPa.s at 200C and having a copolymer concentration of 8 by weight. This solution can be used as such, without it being necessary to separate the copolymer. The separated copolymer had an intrinsic viscosity in tetrahydrofuran 200C of 0.173 dl g and comprised 18.3 96 by weight of nethacrylic acid units. Total acid number 118.Preparation 3 Copolymer of methacrylic acid, n butyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate. A reaction vessel is equipped with an immersed spiral condenser, a stirrer, a liquid inlet tube connected with a dosing pump, and a double contact thermometer for regulating the temperature of the emulsion between 80 and 810C. A solution of 120 mg of carbon tetrabromide in a mixture of 420 g of methacrylic acid, 360 g of methyl methacrylate, and 420 g of n butyl acrylate is added previously whilst stirring at room temperature in a separate vessel to a solution of 60 g of sodium dodecyl sulphate, 3.12 g of sodium hydrogen sulphite and 4 g of ammonium persulphate in 2250 ml of demineralised water.The resulting monomer emulsion is kept homogeneous by continuous stirring. In the reaction vessel 880 mg of sodium hydrogen sulphite are dissolved in 1350 ml of demineralized water, whereupon 800 ml of the monomer emulsion are pumped rapidly at room temperature into the reaction vessel The mixture is heated to 8000 whilst stirring. The polymerization is exothermic, so that the temperature must be kept beneath 8100 by means of the immersed spiral condenser. After the exothermic phase, the remainder of the monomer emulsion is added within approximatively 40 minutes. A solution of 400 mg of ammonium persulpbate in 100 ml of demineralised water is then added into the resulting latex and the reaction mixture is kept for 1 hour at 8000 whilst stirring. After cooling to approximately 700C and filtering through filter paper there is obtained 4.6 1 of latex with 1190 g of copolymer consisting of 35 by weight of methacrylic acid, 35 96 by weight of n butyl acrylate, and 30 by weight of methyl methacrylate. This latex can be used as such or converted into a powder by freeze drying or the copolymer, free from soap, can be isolated as follows therefrom. 250 ml of 5N hydrochloric acid are then added to 2 1 of latex. Subsequently, a small amount of acetone is added till complete coagulation of the copolymer.The residue is stirred in water, filtered, and finally washed with water till the filtrate reacts neutrally.After drying at 6000 there is obtained 520 g of copolymer. Total acid number 228. The invention is illustrated by the following examples without, however, limiting it thereto.
