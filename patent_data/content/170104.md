# Rubber dispersive agent for insoluble sulphur and process of preparing same.

## Abstract
An improved rubber dispersive agent for sulphur con sists of an oil composition consisting of rubber processing oil to which rubber in an amount of 0.1 30 by weight is added, and insoluble sulphur to which said oil composition is added in an amount of 0.5 30 by weight of the total amount. The agent is prepared by mixing the insoluble sulphur with rubber and rubber processing oil in the presence or absence of organic solvent. The rubber disper sive agent acts to improve the dispersing property of the insoluble sulphur into rubber during vulcanization, and to improve the fluidability and stability of the insoluble sulphur itself.
