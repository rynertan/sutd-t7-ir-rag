# Disk file and method of transducing.

## Abstract
A magnetic disk file for storing data on a rotating magnetic disk 10 having concentric recording tracks in cludes where a first inner group 16 of tracks 14 is recorded at one frequency f1, providing optimum track capacity for these tracks, and a second outer group 17 of tracks 15 are recorded at a second higher frequency f2, which also provides optimum track capacity for these tracks. At each address position, each of two magnetic transaucers 11, 12 is associated with a track from different groups. During the writing or reading of serial by byte data, the two tracks are transduced on successive revolutions. Suitable switching circuitry for switching from one transducer to the other in track is provided and also for changing the clock frequency. The system further inclues suitable disk formatting circuitry for converting the two physical tracks into one or more logical tracks having equal byte capacity. The method of transducing includes the steps of switch ing an index from one transducer to the other and adjusting the clock frequency accordingly, so that all logical records have the same capacity. The magnetic disk may be divided into more than two groups of tracks, if desired.
