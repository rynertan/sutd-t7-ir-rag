## Description
TITLEPRECESS FOR THE PREPARTION OF DIPHENYLETHERCARBOXYLIC ACIDS This invention relates to a process for the preparation of diphenyl ether carboxylic acids which are themselves intermediates in the preparation of certain herbicides. Published UK Patent Application No.2014565A describes and claims herbicidal diphenyl ether compounds of the formula I , or a tautomer thereof.EMI2.1 and salts thereof, wherein RÚ is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms, or by a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms R is a hydrogen atom, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, or a nitro group is is a hydrogen atom, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a trifluoromethyl group, or a cyano group R4 is a hydrogen atom, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom, or a trifluoromethyl group R5 is a fluorine, chlorine, bromine1 or iodine atom or a trifluoromethyl group and R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Also described are methods of preparing compounds of formula I starting from a carboxylic acid of the formula EMI3.1 wherein Rê, R , R4 und R5 have the meanings given above. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of diphenyl ether carboxylic acids of the formula EMI3.2 wherein W is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine1 bromine, iodine, trifluoromethyl or cyano X is fluorine, chlorine1 bromine, iodine or trifluoromethyl Y is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine1 bromide, iodine or trifluormethyl and Z is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, which comprises oxidising a tolyl ether compound of the formula EMI3.3 wherein W, X, Y and Z have the previously defined meanings, with molecular oxygen in the presence of a catalyst comprising a heavy metal compound and bromine or a bromine containing compound. The molecular oxygen which is used in the process may be used alone or in admixture with other gases which are inert under the reaction conditions. Thus the oxygen may be used, for example, as air, as a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen with a higher or lower oxygen content than that of air, or as a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide.Particularly useful is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen containing about 9 by volume of oxygen, which is safer to use than air when reactions are carried out under pressure. The heavy metal compounds which may be used as cOm,pone1ts of the catalyst include compounds of vanadium, chronium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel1 molybdenum, cerium and zirconium. Particularly suitable heavy metal compounds are compounds of cobalt and manganese, preferably used in combination. Examples of the heavy metal compounds which may be used are cobalt II bromide, manganese II acetate, iron III chloride and nickel II bromide. Such compounds may be used in the anhydrous form but are more conveniently employed in the hydrated form containing water of crystallisation, i.e. as cobalt II bromide hexahydiate, manganese II acetate tetrahydrate, iron III chloride hexahydrate and nickel II bromide trihydrate respectively. The catalyst comprises a heavy metal compound or conpounds used together with bromine or a bromine containing confound. The latter may be, for example1 hydrogen bromide, an organic bromine compound such as tetrabromoethane or an inorganic bromide. Heavy metal compounds such as cobalt II bromide or manganese II bromide1 by virtue of their bromine content, combine the function of heavy metal compound and bromine containing compound, and may be used as the sole catalyst component, i.e. the separate addition of a bromine containing compound is not essential.However it is preferred that the amount of bromine is in excess of the stoichiometric amount required to form a salt with the metal1 especially up to 20 1 bromine eavy metal atomic ratio . Examples of inorganic bromides which may be used as bronine containing compounds are hydrogen bromide and alkali metal or alkaline earth metal bromides such as the bromides of lithium, sodium1 potassium, calcium and magnesium, and also ammoniun bromide and quaternary ammonium bromides such as tetramethylammonium bromide. The amount of heavy metal compound which is used is not critical, and may be, for example, from 0.01 to 20.0 mol , preferably 0.1 to 10.0 mol , of the tolyl ether compound starting material. Preferred heavy metal components of the catalyst are mixtures of manganese and cobalt compounds.Particularly preferred is a manganese compound used together with a minor amount of a cobalt compound. For example, the cobalt compound may be employed in an amount of 0.05 to 0.5 atom of cobalt per atom of manganese. Such combinations are more economical to use than those in which a substantial amount of a cobalt compound is used, and are also more tolerant of aqueous reaction media. The process is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent, which is desirably a mutual solvent for both the reactant of formula IV and the catalyst, and which should not be oxidised to any substantial extent during the reaction. Water may be used as the solvent bu1. is most suitable when the reaction is carried out under pressure and at high temperatures because of the low aqueous solubility of the compounds of formula IV .Other suitable solvents are aliphatic carboxylic acids1 fol example, glutaric acid, and preferably aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, especially those containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms1 e.g. acetic acid and propionic acid. Mixtures of such acids with water may be used. The amount of solvent is not critical, and may be from 2 to 100 times the weight of the reactant of formula IV . The reaction may be aarried out at normal atmospheric pressure and at temperatures from about 80 C up to the boiling point of the reaction mixture when water, an alji hatic monocarboxylic acid or a mixture of these is used as solvent. Under these conditions reaction times tend to be very prolonged. Thus, using cobalt II bromide as thh role catalyst and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as acetic acid as solvent, reaction is extremely slow at the boiling point of Ilie reaction mixture. A cobalt manganese bromide catalyst, for example, a mixture of cobalt II bromide and manganese II acetate gives an improved reaction rate, b cven so the reaction may take up to 48 hours or even louger to go to completion. A significant part of this time is occupied by an induction period during which there is no detectable reaction. It has been found that the overall reaction time can be substantially reduced if the reaction is carried out in the presence of an oxidising agent in addition to molecular oxygen, for example, alkali metal1 especially sodium and potassium, permanganates, bromates, chromates,dichromates, chlorates and perchlorates, and also chlorine and bromine. Paraldehyde is also an effective oxidising agent.The oxidising agent must be such that it does not inhibit reaction by interferjg with the catalyst, for example, by causing the catalyst to precipitate and o removing it from the sphere of reaction. Preferably the reaction is carried out in an autoclave under superatmospheric pressure and at temperatures up to 3000C, preferably 150 2500C. The pressure must be at least sufficient to maintain a liquid phase in the reaction vessel and will generally be within the range 1 to 20 bar, preferably 10 to 15 bar. At elevated temperature and pressure no inuction period is observed and consequently no addition of oxidising agent other than oxygen is necessary. The progress of the oxidation can be monitored, for example, by gas liquid chromatographic GLC or high performance liquid chromatographic HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture, or conveniently by measurement of the oxygen content of the exit gases, which rises to a steady value at the completion of oxidation. The product may be isolated from the reaction mixture by knows means. Thus when water is the solvent, the product may sirrply be collected hy filtration or by centrifuging from the cooled reaction mixture, washed with water and dried. If the solvent is non aqueous, for example, acetic acid, the product may be precipitated from the cooled reaction mixture by dilution with a liquid which is miscible with the reaction solvent but which is a non solvent for the product, or the non aqueous reaction solvent may be removed, at least in part, by distillation or evaporation before addition of the non solvent. The catalyst components are generally soluble in water1 acetic acid and mIxtures of these, and are thus readily removed from the product. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples in which parts ar.d percentages are by weight. Exnms1e 1 2 Chloro 3 methyl 4 trifluoromethyldiphenyl ether 175 parts 1 manganous acetate tetrahydrate 6 parts 1 cobaltous chloride hexahydrate 16 parts , potassium bromide 10 parts and propionic acid 1000 parts are stirred at 125 130oC. A steady stream of oxygen is introduced into the solution during 18 hours. After this time, the propionic acid is removed by distillation and water 1500 parts is added to the residue with stirring.The resulting suspension is filtered and the residue is dissolved in a solution of sodium carbonate 64 parts in water 1500 parts . The aqueous solution is extracted with toluene 172 parts and the aqueous layer is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid 150 parts . The suspension so obtained is filtered and the solid residue is washed with cold water and dried at 60 C to give 3 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy benzoic acid t121 parts strength 84 by high performance liquid chro natography HPLc . Example 2 2 Chloro 3 methyl 4 trifluoro methyldiphenyl ether 175 parts , manganous acetate tetrahydrate 1.2 parts , cobaltous bromide hexahydrate 4.4 parts and acetic acid 1000 parts are stirred at 114 116eC. A steady stream of air is introduced into the solution during 48 hours.Oxidation products were detected by GLC after 22 hours. After completion of the reaction the acetic acid is removed by distillation and waters 400 parts is added with stirring.The resulting suspension is filtered and the solid residue is washed with cold water and dried at 60µC to give 3 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy benzoic acid 175 parts strength 85 by HPLC yield 77 . A similar reaction which was stopped after 36 hours gave only a 44 yield of product.Example 3 To acetic acid 1000 parts is added manganous acetate tetrahydrate 1.2 parts , cobaltous bromide hexahydrate 4.4 parts and potassium permanganate 0. part , and a stream of air is passed through the mixture. 2 Chloro 3 methyl 4 trifluorome thyldiphenyl ether 175 parts is then added and the mixture is stirred at 114 116BC. The induction period i.e. period before oxidation products could be detected by GLC was less than 30 minutes and the reaction was complete in 18 hours.Isolation of the product as described in Example 2 gave 3 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy benzoic acid 168 parts strength 92 by HPLC yield 80 . Example 4 The procedure described in Example 3 was repeated except that the 0.7 parts of potassium permanganate were replaced by 0.7 parts of potassium bromate. The induction period was less than 30 minutes. Reaction was continued for 24 hours to give 170 parts of product strength 90 by HPLC yield 79 .Example 5 Thc procedure described in Example 3 was repeated except that the 0.7 part of potassium permanganate was replaced by 2.15 parts of bromine added before the air is introduced. The induction period was less than 30 minutes. Reaction was continued for 24 hours to give 170 parts of product strength 92 by HPLC yield 81 .c 6 2 Chloro 3 methyl 4 trifluoromethyldiphenyl ether 286.5 parts , ma .wanous acetate tetrahydrate 0.86 parts , cobaltous bromide hexahydrate 3.26 parts and glacial acetic acid 1040 parts were placed in a 5 cm. diameter x 85 cm. vertical titanium tube reactor1 having a gas inlet and a liquid outlet at the base and equipped with a reflux condenser and ith provision for electrical heating and water cooling. The reactor was pressurised to 13.8 bar 200 p.s.i. with nitrogen and heated to 180 C. The nitrogen supply was disconnected and a mixture of 9 oxygen in nitrogen was passed into the solution via the bottom inlet at a rate equivalent to 9 1 minute at N.T.P. The exit gases were monitored for oxygen content using a paramagnetic oxygen analyser and passage of gas vas continued until the oxygen content of the exit gases showed a steady rise. This occurred after the oxygen containing gas had been passed into the reactor for 58 minutes. Nitrogen was then passed into the reactor to displace residual oxygen, the reactor was cooled to 50 C and the pressure lowered to 2 bar. The product in acetic acid solution was then run off via the base outlet valve of the reactor1 the reactor was flushed out with acetic acid 200 parts and these washings were added to the product solution. RPLC analysis of the crude product solution indicated a 92 aonversion of the starting material to 3 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy benzoic acid. Examples 7 12 The following preparations were carried out using the apparatus and general method of Example 6, but varying catalyst type and amount, reactant concentration, type of oxygen containing caws, solvent type Example 11 and diphenylether starting material Example 12 . The products of Examples 7 11 were the same as in Example 6.The product of Example 12 was 3 2 chloro 6 fluoro 4trifluoromethylphenoxy benzoic acid. Details are shown in the following table.
