# Image pickup tube.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a high velocity electron beam scanning nega tively charge biased image pickup tube comprising a target which includes at least a transparent conductive layer 2 , a photoconductor layer 4 and a layer 13 for secondary elec tron emission on a light transmissive insulating substrate 1 , and in which the transparent conductive layer 2 is arranged on a light incidence side, the photoconductor layer 4 being made of amorphous silicon.
