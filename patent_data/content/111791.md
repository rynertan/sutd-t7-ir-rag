INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION The discovcry has now been aade that when a polyphenylene ether resin, an aromatic phosphate compound and 9 stable bromine compound of low volatility, together, are incorporated in an aromatic polycaronate resin or blend of the resin, the resulting composition possesses better flame rctardance than the corresponding blend without the polyphenylene ether. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In general, the compositions or this invention are comprised of a normally flammable aromatic polycarbonate resin and a flame retardant amount of a multicomponent agent comprising a polyphenylene ether resin, an organic phosphate compound, and a bromine containing compound, preferably a brominated bisphenoxy alkane. Preferably, the polycarbonate resin is selected from among those having the formulaEMI3.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction. In especially preferred embodiments, the polycarbonate is a resin of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R2 and are, independently, hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl X is, independently, lower alkyl, chloro, bromo or hydrogen p and r are, independently, from 0 to 4 and n represents the total number of monomer units and is an integer at least about 30, and more usually, from 40 to 400 or higher. The term lower alkyI is intended to mean a straight or branched alkyl group having from 1 to about 10, and more frequently, from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl,.nonyl, decyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, trimethyl ethyl methyl, and bo forth. Special mention is made of polycarbonate resins devoid of substituents.on the aromatic rings in the polymer chain, i.e., where p and r are zero in the above formula, although this feature is not essential to the successful practice of the invention. By way of illustration, the terminology aromatic polycarbonate resin as employed in this disclosure is meant to include homopolymeric carbonates and copolymeric carbonates, as well as mixtures of the two, in which the polymer or copolymer has a molecular weight number average of from about 8,000 to about 200,000 or higher, but preferably from about 10,000 to about 80,000. The preferred polymers will usually be characterized by an intrinsic, i.e., inherent, viscosity within the range from about 0.30 to about 1.0 deciliters per gram dl g as measured in solution in methylene chloride at 25 C.To illustrate further, such polycarbonates may be.derived from dihydric phenols such as 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxyaiphenyl propane and bis 3 ,3 dichloro 4 ,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane. Other suitable dihydric phenols are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 6,334,154 and 4,131,575. The above mentioned aromatic polycarbona tes can be prepared by use of known processes, such as, for instance, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, e.g.., phosgene, in accordance with procedures set forth in the patent literature cited above and in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436 or by transesterification processes such as those which are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,153,008 at well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. In addition, the aromatic polycarbonates utilized in the present invention can include polymeric derivatives of a dihydric phenol, a dicarboxylic acid and carbonic acid. A suitable procedure is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,169,121. Branchedwpoly carbonates, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,001,184, or mixtures of branched and linear polycarbonates may also be employed in the compositions. Also encompassed within the scope of this invention are polycarbonates which have been prepared from two or more different dihydric phenols, or from a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or acid terminated polyester, or with a dibasic acid in the event that. a carbonate interpolymer or copolymer is desired. A wide variety of aromatic polycarbonates are thus useful in the present composition. The flame retardant portion of the composition is composed of a flame retardant aromatic phosphate compound, a polyphenylene ether resin enhancing agent, and a brominated bi phenoxy compound. The polyphenylene ether resin component of the flame retardant additive may be a hamo or copolymer of the formula.EMI5.1 wherein Q, Q, Q and Q , are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals, hydrocarbonoxy radicals, and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals and n represents the total number of monomer units and is an integer at least about 20, and preferably at least 50. Especially preferred is poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether. The polyphenylene ether resins useful in the compositions of this invention can be prepared by following known procedures, including those described by Allan Hay in .5 Patent Nos. 3,306,874 and 3,306,875 and by Gelu Stamatoff in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,257,357 and 3,257,358. The ar natic phosphate component of the flame retardant additive preferably is a compound having the formulaEMI6.1 where R is the same or different and is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkyl substituted aryl, halogen.sibsti tutued aryl, aryl substituted alkyl, halogen, hydrogen or a combination of any of the foregoing, provided at least one R is aryl. Examples include phenylbisdodecyl phosphate, .phenylbisneopentyl phosphate, phenylethyl ene hydrogen phosphate, phenyl bis 3,5,5 trimethylhexyl phosphate , ethyldiphenyl phosphate, 2 ethyl hexyldi p tlyl phosphate, di phenyl hydrogen phosphate, bis Z ethyl hexyl p tolylphosphate, tritolyl phosphate, bis 2ethylhexyl phenyl phosphate, tri nonylphenyl phosphate, phenylmethyl hydrogen phosphate, di dodecyl p tolyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, dibutyiphenyl phosphate, 2 chioroethyl diphenyl phosphate, p tolyl bis 2 ,5 ,5 trimethylhexyl phosphate, 2 ethylhexyldiphenyl phosphate, diphenyl hydrogen phosphate, and the like. The preferred phosphates are those in which each Q is aryl., Esp ecially preferred is triphenyl phosphate, which may be either unsubstituted or substituted, for example, isopropylated triphenyl phosphate mixtures. In general, these two ingredients are supplied in amounts sufficient to provide between about 5 and about 40 percent of the polyphenylene ether resin and between about 1 and about 20 percent of the aromatic phosphate compound, based on the weight of the polycarbonate resin and polyphenylene ether resin combined i.e., based on the total resin weight . It has been found, and this constitutes a further preferred feature of the invention, that best results are achieved when the polyphenylene ether resin and the aromatic phosphate compound are present in the compositions in a weight ratio of the two between 8 1 and 2 1. Small amounts of the bromine containing compound can further enhance the flame retardancy of the present compositions. This compound should be reasonably stable at elevated temperatures above 1000C. and relatively non volatile, e.g., having a low volatility at tempesatures of 100 to l50C. The most favored compounds for purposes of this invention are those of the formulaEMI8.1 where R is alkylene, straight or branched, having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and more preferably from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and q and s represent the total number of bromine atoms on each ring and are independently integers from I to 5. Amounts of between about 1 and about 20 percent by weight, based on the polycarbanate resin, are normally sufficient to decrease the average quenching time andlor to retard the tendency of the composition to drip molten resign, and such amounts are preferred. Examples of bis phenoxy compounds useful in the practice of this invention are 1,2 bis 2,4,6 tri bromophenoxy ethane 1,3 bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy propane 1,4 bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy butane and 2,2 bis 4 bromophenoxy propane. Preferred is 1,2bis 2,4,6 tribromophenoxy ethane. The above compounds are available comnercially or can be made by following known procedure, such as those which are described by Arnold Anderson in U.S.Patent No. 4,016,138. By way of illustration, the bis phenoxy compound may be prepared by reacting a halogenated phenol with a halogenated alkane in the presence of a base at a temperature of from 40 to 2000 C. Suitable bases include alkali metal hydroxides, e.g., sodium or potassium hydroxide, carbonates, bicarbonates, oxides and hydrides. The reaction can be conducted in an organic solvent, such as a ketone or alcohol, or in an aqueous solvent, such as water or a mixture of water and alcohol or water and a ketone. The bis phenoxy com pound is recovered by conventional methods such as distillation or crystallization and can be purified by standard techniques. The compositions of the invention can also include one or more additives conventionally employed with polycarbonate resins to improve the chemical and physical properties of the molded articles. The additives can be selected from among, for instance, plasti ciders, antioxidants. stabilizers, mineral fillers, reinforcing agents, pigments, dyes, impact modifiers and so forth. On the typical case, the additive or additives are in cluded in minor but effective amounts varying between about 1 andSOZ by weight of the total composition. The compositions can be prepared in various ways. In one procedure, the ingredients are tumble blended, the resultant blend is passed through an ex truder at g temperature between 400 and 500 F., the extrudate is cooled, chopped into pellets and molded at between 450 and 5000P. In an alternate procedure, the ingredients including a small portion of the polycarbonate are compounded on a roll mill at a temperature between 400 and 450 F., a major portion of the polocarbonate resin being kept in reserve, however. A homogeneous blend is produced, to which is then added, with thorough mixing, the remainder of the polycarbonate. The resultant mixture is molded at, e.g., 400 to 500 F. DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS The invention is illustrated in the following examples. These are for the purpose of showing preferred or best embodiments and are not intended to be limiting. All proportions are in parts by weight. EXAMPLES 1 5 The compositions noted below were prepared by compounding the ingredients on a two roll mill at 4100 to 420 F., then compression molding into test parts at 4400F.for 10 minutes. As can be seen, comparison was made between a control, consisting of only the polycarbonate resin, various other blends containing one or two of the three flame retardant ingredients with the polycarbonate resins, and a blend containing all three flame retardant ingredients in accordance with the invention.

An increase to 12 parts of this material markedly reduces the self extinguishing times, but the amount needed is undesirably large. The blend according to the invention, sample 5, gives best overall results with use of a smaller amount of triphenyl phosphate 4 parts and 4 parts of brominated agent. EXAMPLES 6 9 The procedure of the previous examples is repeated for the compositionw noted in the Table below, in which I, 2 bis 2,3 4,5, 6 pentabromophenoxy ethane is illustrated.

Even better results are achieved when all three flame retardant ingredients are present samples 8 and 9 , in accordance with the invention. Optionally, the composition can and often do also contain an additional compound selected from among those known to synergistically enhance the effect of braminated flame retardant agents, such as compounds based on antimony or molybdenum. Particular mention is made of antimony oxide. Small amounts, for example, less than 10 by weight, are usually sufficient to even further enhance the flame retardancy of the present c npositions. All of the above mentioned patents and or publications are incorporated herein by reference.Obviously,. other modifications and variations are possible in the light of the above disclosure. For instance, instead of poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether resin, copolymers such as poly 2, 6 dimethyl co 2,3, 6 trimethyl l, 4 phenylene ether can be sub stitutad. Clay filled or glass fiber reinforced counterparts of the compositions shown are also possible. It is to be understood, therefore, that changes may be made in the particular embodiments shown which are within the full intended scope of the invention defined in the appended claims.
