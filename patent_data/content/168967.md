## Description
OSTOMY PROSTHESIS The invention is in the field of medical prosthetic devices, and particularly devices intended for use with ileostomy or colostomy patients. In now routine surgical operations referred to as ileostomies or colostomies, a portion of the bowel is removed and the end of the remaining bowel is brought out through the patient s abdomen. The end of the remaining bowel either terminates at or very close to the surface of the patient s skin, or may protrude slightly from the outer skin surface. The bowel end portion passes through the abdominal facia, muscle, fat and skin layers, and the end portion of the bowel is referred to as the stoma . Patients who have had such surgical operations often are provided with externally worn containers such as plastic bags, the bags having openings that are adhesively sealed to the skin about the stoma. A short tube may be anchored at one end within the stoma with its outer end extending outwardly for attachment to a receptacle tubes of this type are shown in U.S.Patents 3,828,782 and 4,119,100. Ileostomy and colostomy patients may encounter a variety of physical and psychological problems. From the physical standpoint, such patients often must carefully control their diets, and continuously must contend with bags and other items of equipment. Bowel contents which come into contact with the skin of a patient surrounding the stoma can irritate and infect the skin surface such infections may become particularly threatening because they are so difficult to heal inasmuch as the infected area continuously becomes reinfected through contact with bowel contents. U.S. Patent 4,381,765 described an ileostomy valve having a drainage tube insertable in the stoma of a patient. The drainage tube was illustrated as having a balloon like structure at its inner end which was carried within the bowel deep to the facia and which prevented the drainage tube from being pulled forwardly and outwardly of the stoma. The outer end portion of the drainage tube was depicted as including a valve body having an orifice through which the drainage tube extended. In use, the valve body would be slid rearwardly along the drainage tube toward the patient s abdomen, and would then be held in place by appropriate bending. Although the ileostomy valve described in U.S.Patent 4,381,765 has given excellent results in actual usage, there is a tendency for the rather thick walled drainage tube, which is under continuous tension, to creep and thus to withdraw gradually from the valve body. Also, the outer, sealed end portion of the drainage tube was continuously exposed and could be considered, at least by some, to be unsightly. The present invention in one embodiment provides an ostomy prosthesis that comprises a drainage tube having inner and outer end portions, the inner end portion being receivable in the stoma of a patient deep to the facia and having walls of sufficient rigidity as to maintain a generally circular, open crosssection, the outer end portion being connected to and communicating with the inner end portion and having limp, readily collapsible walls which are collapsed inwardly by the stoma of a patient. Reversible securing means, desirably a toroidal balloon structure, is carried by the inner end portion of the drainage tube to reversibly secure the same to and within the stoma deep to the facia, and sealing means are carried by the limp, collapsible outer end portion of the drainage tube to releasably seal the latter against escape of bowel contents.In a preferred embodiment, the drainage tube includes a generally rigid section of tubing defining the inner end portion and a limp, easily collapsible section of tubing defining the outer end portion, the limp tubing being drawn over the more rigid tubing and being concentrically sealed to the more rigid tubing at at least two points spaced along the length of the more rigid tubing to define inflatable balloon means, the prosthesis including means for inflating the balloon means. In another embodiment, the invention relates to means for releasably sealing the outer end portion of a drainage tube such as the tube described above. The sealing means comprises plate means carried by the tube exterior of the patient for releasably shaping the limp, readily collapsible outer end portion in a bent, collapsed, generally Z shaped orientation to seal that portion against the escape of bowel contents. The sealing means includes cover means overlying the bent, collapsed outer end portion of the drainage tube and closable upon the plate means to maintain the drainage tubing in the bent, sealed orientation as thus described. Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a drainage tube of the invention, shown broken away and in partial cross section Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a prosthesis of the invention shown partially installed in the stoma of a patient Figure 3 is a broken away view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a front view of a portion of the prosthesis shown in Figure 2 Figure 5 is a cross sectional view taken along line 5 5 of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a plan view of a modified device of the type shown in Figure 4 and Figure 7 is a cross sectional view taken along line 7 7 of Figure 6. The device of the invention is shown in Figure 1 as 10 and comprises a drainage tube 12 having an inner end portion 14 and an outer end portion 16 .The walls of the inner end portion 14 , although desirably soft and having some flexibility, are nonetheless sufficiently rigid as to maintain a generally circular, open cross section within the stoma of a patient. The inner end portion of the drainage tube desirably is made of silicone rubber or similar material, and may, for example, have an outer diameter of about 13 mm and a wall thickness of about 2 mm.The inner end 18 is desirably beveled or rounded to avoid tissue irritation. The outer end portion 16 is provided with a proximal end 20 which is connected to the inner end portion 14 of the drainage tubing, and a distal end portion 22 which, in normal usage, protrudes forwardly, that is, distally, from the stoma of a patient. The outer end portion 16 desirably also is made of silicone rubber and has approximately the same external diameter as does the inner end portion 14 .Whereas the inner end portion 14 is relatively rigid, however, the outer end portion 16 is limp and readily collapsed by the radially inwardly directed forces generated by the bowel. As will be described in greater detail below, the limpness of the walls of the outer end portion 16 permit this portion to yield and collapse as it passes through the stoma, and this in turn appears to reduce the production of mucus in the stoma. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the proximal end 20 of the outer drainage tube portion is drawn snuggly over the more rigid inner end portion 14 . It will be understood that the walls of the outer end portion 16 of this embodiment are quite elastic, and the limp tubing is folded forwardly upon itself as shown at 24 in Figure 1 to provide an ex cess of material at this location. Relatively rigid bands 26 encircle and tightly bind the outer end portion to the inner end portion near ends of the latter, and, further, outer bands 28 of, erg., sili cone rubber may be employed to cover the rigid bands 26 . The rigid bands are spaced along the length of the inner end portion 14 of drainage tubing to define, with the folded portion of the outer end portion, an inflatable balloon structure 30 . An inflation tube 32 extends from within the inflatable balloon structure 30 forwardly along the length of the outer end portion, and terminates in a lid retention valve through which fluid e.g., water under pressure may be injected into the balloon structure and which prevents the escape of such fluid. In the embodiment depicted, the fluid retention valve comprises a plug 34 of silicone rubber and an end tube 36 that radially compresses the plug and that connects the plug to the end of the inflation tube 32 .The plug may be provided with a preformed hole pierced through its length, as designated at 38 such that a blunt nosed hypodermic needle may be forced through the pierced hole in the plug to communicate with the inflation tube, the plug sealing behind the bluntnosed needle as it is withdrawn from the plug. The inflation tube 32 may be adhered to the walls of the limp outer portion of drainage tubing if desired to restrain the inflation tube from becoming tangled or otherwise out of position. Referring now to Figure 2, which shows an ostomy device of the invention in position within the stoma of a patient, the stoma is designated generally as wS , the facia as wFt, the fat and muscular layer generally as wMw and the abdominal skin as WNW. The device of the invention has been inserted in the stoma wSw so that the inner end portion 14 is deep to that is, proximal of the facia WFW. The balloon structure 30 is inflated with saline solution by injecting the same into the balloon structure through the inflation tube 32 , and the limp, outer end portion of the drainage tubing 16 is then pulled outwardly, that is, distally, by the patient to cause the portion of the stoma that is distended through inflation of the balloon structure 30 to bear forwardly against the facia WFW, the facia thus serving to positively retain within the stoma the balloon structure 30 and hence the inner end portion of the drainage tube. As noted in Figure 2, the limp walls of the outer end portion are easily collapsed, as shown at 39 , by the walls of the bowel. when the bowel contents are to be eliminated, the walls of the stoma surrounding the collapsed portion 36 will distend or dilate in the normal fashion to permit the passage of bowel contents through the outer end portion 16 . The distal end 22 of the outer portion of the drainage tube should not only be maintained in tension to maintain the proper seating of the distended portion of the stoma against the facia, but also must be capable of being sealed off with a waterproof seal to avoid the unintentional escape of bowel contents.This can be accomplished, if desired, through the use of a device such as that depicted in U.S. Patent 4,381,765. More desirably, however, an improved tensioning and sealing device is employed such as that depicted in Figures 2 7, all of which will now be disclosed in greater detail. Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, a generally circular substantially rigid plate is shown as 40 , the plate having a central aperture 42 through which may extend the externally protruding portion of a drainage tube such as that shown at 16 in Figures 1 and 2. A pair of generally wU shaped wire bails 44 , 46 have their free ends rotatably mounted respectively in mounting blocks 48 , 50 , the mounting blocks being spaced on opposite sides of the aperture 42 and the mounting blocks and bails being so positioned and spaced as to permit the bails to be folded one upor another as shown in Figure 4.Each bail, it will be noted, is provided with a broad central portion 52 which is desirably straight and which further is preferably substantially wider preferably at least about 1.2 times wider than the diameter of the aperture 42 . Further, the wire bails preferably have small outwardly extending portions 54 ât either end of the central portion to restrain sideways movement of tubing bent about the central portion 52 . A generally circular cover 60 is hingedly mounted at one side to a side of the plate 40 so that the cover may be pivoted downwardly upon the plate. Preferably, the cover and plate are molded as a single unit, and the hinge connection in this case takes the form of a flexible, thin walled strap 62 . Means are provided to releasably hold the cover upon the plate.As shown in the embodiment of Figures 2 5, the rim 64 of the generally dish shaped cover has an inwardly protruding lip 66 which is oriented to come into contact with and slip or snap into the small grooves 68 formed on the outer circumferential surface of the bail mounting blocks 48 , 50 . Referring particularly to Figure 2, the plate 40 is placed against the skin wNw of a patient, a thin layer of gauze wGw being placed between the plate and skin as desired or needed. The proximal end 22 of a protruding drainage tube such as that shown at 16 is inserted forwardly through the aperture 42 in the plate, and by simultaneously pulling the tubing outwardly and pressing the plate against the skin of the patient, the skin, fat and muscle layer wMw and facia are, in effect, pinched between the distended bowel portion and the plate, thereby securely anchoring the drainage tubing against movement.The drainage tubing may then be bent upwardly and around the central portion 52 of bail 44 , as shown in Figure 3, the bail 44 then being pivoted to lie flatly adjacently the outer face of the plate 40 . The tubing length is then bent about the central portion 52 of the opposirg beil 46 , as shown in Figure 2, and that bail is then similarly pivoted downwardly as shown by the arrow A in Figure 2 to lie flatly adjacent the outer face of the plate 40 . In this manner, the tubing is provided with a folded, flattened, generally Z shaped orientation.The terminal end portion 56 Figure 2 may be trimmed, or may be merely folded atop the Z shaped bent portion of the tubing. when the cover 60 is snapped onto the plate 40 , the inner surface 70 bears inwardly against the folded over portion of tubing, holding the same in place and preventing it from unraveling or creeping under tension. The outer surface 72 of the cover 60 may be completely smooth and skin toned, or may be decorated or provided with various designs or coverings as desired. The cover not only presses inwardly upon and immobilizes the Z shaped tubing carried by the plate 40 , but additionally shields the tubing from view and presents a smooth, not unpleasing design to an observer. It has been found that when the outer end portion of the drainage tube is of limp, collapsible material such as that described above in connection with Figures 1 and 2, the folding of the drainage tube in the manner depicted in Figure 2 provides an extremely satisfactory waterproof seal and further tends to completely prevent the tubing from creeping about the bails when maintained under continuous tension.Thus, when the drainage tubing device shown in Figures 1 and 2 is employed with the plate and cover depicted in Figures 2 5, the prosthesis is held firmly and reliably in place. Figures 6 and 7 depict a modified form of plate and cover. The plate, designated 80 , is generally circular and is provided with a central aperture 82 similar to, and having the same purpose as, the aperture 42 in the embodiment depicted in Figure 4.Arising on opposite sides of the aperture are a pair of oppositely extending parallel fingers 84 , 86 spaced from but generally parallel to the outer surface 88 of the plate. The cover 90 is hinged at one edge to an edge of the plate by means of a thinwalled hinge 92 , and the cover is provided with a latch hook 94 capable of hooking over and latching onto an outwardly extending shoulder 96 formed on the mating portion of the plate, all as shown inFigure 7. In use, the protruding section of drainage tube passes distally through the aperture 82 and then is led first beneath and is bent around the finger 84 , thence is doubled back and led beneath and bent around the finger 86 , and thence extends again toward the finger 84 , thereby providing the tubing with a generally wz shaped configuration.The inner surface 96 of the cover is so oriented that when the cover is snapped downwardly upon the plate 80 , the inner surface 96 of the cover comes into contact with and presses inwardly against the folded over portions of tubing, thereby anchoring the same in place. Various changes can be made to the prostheses of the present invention. For example, although the limp, collapsible section of drainage tubing in the embodiment shown in Figures 1 ad 2 forms an integral part of the balloon structure snowy ctS 35,, trib such tion of tubing need not be elastic and may instead merely be cemented at its rearward end to the more rigid tubing 14 , a separate length of tubing being employed to form the balloon structure 30 .
