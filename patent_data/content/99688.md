# REAR VIEW MIRROR

## Abstract
A rear view mirror for a motor vehicle comprises a reflective member 10 located in a housing 12 . Resilient coupling means 18, 20 connects one edge of the reflective member 10 to an adjacent wall of the housing 12 and urges the reflective member 10 in a direction towards the opposite wall of the housing 12 while allowing angular movement thereof about two orthoganol axes lying in planes parallel to that of the reflective member. A pair of spaced detent members 28 on the opposite edge of the reflective member 10 are urged by the resilient coupling means 18, 20 into engagement with complementary formations 32 on an adjacent wall of the housing 12 . The detent members 28 can be displaced out of engagement with their com plementary formations, by means of a control member 34 , so as to permit movement of the reflective member 10 about said resilient coupling means 18, 20 .
