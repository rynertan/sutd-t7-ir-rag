# Access device for positioning a light beam to a desired guide groove of an optical memory apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical memory apparatus wherein predetermined information is optically recorded on a recording medium along guide grooves previously formed and then played back, comprises projecting means for projecting a laser beam on the recording medium, light reception means for receiving reflected light from the recording medium, means for generating a tracking error signal on the basis of an output from the light reception means, first means 26 a , for enveloping upper an information signal 512 obtained from the light reception means, second means 202 for generat ing a signal corresponding to the direction of passage each time the light beam passes through the guide groove, on the basis of the output from said first means and the tracking error signal, third means 203 209 for detecting a difference between the guide groove where the light beam exists and a target guide groove on the basis of the output from said second means and for generating a first control signal for controlling the position of the light beam in correspondence with said difference, light beam position control means 1, 210,251 for bringing the light beam near to the target guide groove in response to the first control signal.
