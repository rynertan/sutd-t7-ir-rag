# Stepping motor driving circuit.

## Abstract
A motor driving circuit includes first and second transis tors TR1, TR2 whose collectors are respectively connected to each one end of a pair of motor coils L1, L2 and whose emitters are grounded through a first resistor R1 , and which are alternately turned on, a switching circuit TSC2 con nected between the other ends of the pair of motor coils L1, L2 and a power supply terminal VC , and a comparator CMP2 which receives a reference voltage and a voltage drop across the first resistor R1 respectively at its first and second input terminals and controls the conduction state of the switching circuit TSC2 in accordance with the result of comparison between two input voltages. A second resistor R29 and a capacitor C2 are connected in series between the output terminal and the second input terminal of the comparator CMP2 .
