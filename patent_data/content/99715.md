# Catalyst composition, method for its production and its use in the production of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas.

## Abstract
A catalyst composition for use in the production of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas comprises the essential metals a at least one of iron, cobalt, nickel and ruthenium, and b at least one of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium supported on silicate, as described and claimed in US Patent No. 4,061,724, the metals a b being present on the silicalite support in an amount in the range from 0.5 to 15 by weight. The catalyst composition may be modified by addition of the hydrogen form of a crystalline zeolite having the composition expressed as mole ratios of oxides 0.9 0.2 Mâ‚‚
