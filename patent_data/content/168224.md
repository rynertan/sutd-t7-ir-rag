## Description
This invention is generally directed to toner compositions, and the use of these compositions in electrostatographic imaging systems. More specifically, the present invention is directed to colored toner and developer compositions, containing therein certain organic charge enhancing additives which impart a positive charge to the toner resin particles. Toner and developer compositions with the charge enhancing additives of the present invention are useful in various electrostatographic imaging systems, particularly colored imaging systems, having incorporated therein as the photoresponsive member a layered imaging device which is negatively charged. Toner and developer compositions, including colored developer compositions are well known. These compositions usually contain toner particles consisting of a resin and colorants, and carrier particles. With regard to colored developer compositions the colorants are usually selected from cyan dyes or pigments, magenta dyes or pigments, yellow dyes or pigments, or mixtures thereof. There is thus disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,844,815, colored developer compositions containing as the yellow pigment Foron yellow, while U.S. Patent 4,035,310, discloses colored toner compositions containing as a yellow pigment Yellow 97, and carrier particles generally comprised of steel coated with various polymeric resinous substances. Several prior art patents also disclose the incorporation into toner compositions as separate components, charge enhancing additives primarily for the purpose of imparting a positive charge to the toner resin particles. There is thus disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,298,672 positively charged toner compositions containing resin particles, and pigment particles, and as a charge enhancing additive alkyl pyridinium compounds and their hydrates of the formula as detailed in Column 3, beginning at line 14. Examples of alkyl pyridinium compounds disclosed include cetyl pyridinium chloride. Moreover, there is disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,338,390 positively charged toner compositions having incorporated therein as charge enhancing additives various organic sulfate and sulfonate compositions, including stearyl dimethyl phenethylammoniumpara toluene sulfonate. Further, in U.S. Patent 3,893,935 there is described the use of quaternary ammonium salts as charge control agents for electrostatic toner compositions. In accordance with the disclosure of this patent, certain quaternary ammonium salts, when incorporated into a toner material, provided a composition which exhibited relatively high uniform stable net toner charge when mixed with a suitable carrier vehicle which toner also exhibited a minimum amount of toner throw off. Additionally there is disclosed in the prior art colored toner and developer compositions containing as charge enhancing additives para halophenylcarboxylic acids, and the salts thereof. More specifically, there is disclosed in this patent positively charged toner compositions containing resin particles, dye particles, such as cyan, magenta, or yellow dyes, and as a charge enhancing additive, in an amount of from about 0.1 percent by weight to about 10 percent by weight, para halophenylcarboxylic acids, and the salts thereof, including 4 fluorobenzoic acid, 4 chlorobenzoic acid, and 4 bromobenzoic acid. While the above described toner and developer compositions are suitable for their intended purposes there continues to be a need for new developer compositions. Specifically there continues to be a need for colored toner compositions wherein a charge establishing group is desirably coupled to a chromophore or colorant, thereby providing anchoring by covalent bonding, allowing the resulting high molecular weight compounds to retain the charge establishing group therein. In contrast with many of the prior art charge enhancing additives they in many instances are undesirably leached from the toner composition, and thus must be continously monitored and replaced. Furthermore there remains a need for colored toner compositions wherein the charge establishing additive can be varied as desired depending on the colorant chromophore selected, and the triboelectric charge value to be imparted to the toner resin particles. Additionally there continues to be a need for colored toner compositions wherein the combined chromophore charge establishing group molecule is water insoluble, and therefore evidences reduced humidity sensitivity allowing the resulting triboelectric charge values imparted to the toner resins to be maintained at a relatively constant level. Further there remains a need for colored toner compositions in which dyes rather than pigments are employed as the colorants, thus imparting greater clarity and brightness to the resultant electrographic prints. There is also a need for dye colorants that are highly compatible with their host resinous material, and evidence substantially no tendency to leach, bleed, or sublime from the host resin. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide toner and developer compositions, wherein the toner particles are positively charged, which overcome the above noted disadvantages. According to the present invention, there is provided a dry positively charged colored toner composition comprising resin particles, and a dye charge control composition represented by the following formula In addition, the chromophore and charge establishing groups can contain thereon various solubilizing groups. The chromophores are permanently attached by covalent bonding to charge establishing groups. The toner compositions are useful in color imaging systems, wherein electrostatic images are separately formed on various imaging members, followed by sequential development with the developer compositions of the present invention, transfer of the developed images to suitable substrates, and optional permanent affixing thereon. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there are provided positively charged colored toner compositions comprised of resin particles, in which are dissolved dye molecules of the following formula, comprising a chromophore or colorant attached to charge establishing groups With regard to compositions represented by the above formula illustrative examples of X groups include various chromophores or colorants, including cyan chromophores, magenta chromophores, yellow chromophores, or mixtures thereof. Examples of specific groups that may be selected as magenta chromophores include for example quinacridone residues, such as 2,9 dimethylquinacridone, diazo residues such as the dye identified in the color index as Cl 26050 or Cl Solvent Red 19, anthraquinone residues including those dyes identified in the color index as Cl 60710 or Cl Disperse Red 15, Cl62015 or Cl Disperse Red 11, Cl68210 or Solvent Red 52,1 amino 2 N alkylamino 4 hydroxyanthraquinone, and the like. Illustrative examples of cyan chromophores that may be used are copper tetra 4 octadecylsulfonamide phthalocyanine, idanthren chromophores including that of the dye indentified in the color index as Cl 69810, Special Blue X 2137, and anthraquinone chromophores such as that of the dye identified in the color index as Disperse Blue 60 or Serilene Brilliant Blue 2G, and the like. Illustrative examples of yellow chromophores that may be selected are 1 phenylthioanthraquinone, 1,5 bisphenylthioanthraquinone, 1,8 bis phenylthioanthraquinone, diarylide yellow 3,3 dichlorobenzidene acetoacetanilides, monoazo chromophores inclusive of the dye identified in the color index as Cl 12700 or Cl Solvent Yellow 16, nitrophenylamino sulfonamides such as that of the dye identified in the color index as Foron Yellow SE SCW, or Cl Disperse Yellow 42, monoazo chromophores such as that of the dye identified in the color index as Permanent Yellow FGL or Cl Pigment Yellow 97, and other similar dyes. There can be selected as the saturated linker or spacer substituents those groups which will covalently bond the chromophore X to the charge establishing group C, while simultaneously insulating the chromophores from any adverse characteristics inclusive of a change in the color intensity or hue resulting from electronic effects from the charge establishing groups. Accordingly thus examples of linking substances A include various saturated alkylenes, like ethylene, propylene, isopropylene, butylene, isobutylene, pentylene, hexylene linear or branched , heptylene linear or branched and similar groupings, with propylene and hexylene being preferred. Other spacer groups that can be selected include alkoxyalkylenes, such as polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene and the like. One primary advantage of the present invention resides in the degree of flexibility provided for the selection of the charge establishing group, as this group can be derived from many known materials depending for example on the required triboelectric charging level desired for the resulting toner composition. Other criteria for the selection of the charge establishing group include toxicity properties, and the rate of accumulation of triboelectric charge of uncharged toner particles when mixed with previously charged toner particles. Also since the charge establishing group is electronically insulated from the chromophore portion of the molecule of the dye, a change in the chemical structure of the charge establishing group has substantially no influence on the chromophore properties of the dye molecule. Illustrative examples of charge establishing groups C include materials selected from amines, quaternary ammonium salts, ethers, thioethers, esters, thioesters, sulfonamides, sulfonates, amides, biguanides, and the like. The preferred charge establishing groups for several of the developer compositions of the present invention are amines, quaternary ammonium salts, esters, and the like. More specifically as charge establishing groups there can be selected amino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, dipropylamino, dibutylamino, pipecolino, morpholino, cyclohexylamino, cyclopentylamino, methoxy, ethoxy, isopropoxy, thiomethoxy, thioethoxy, thiobutoxy, O methoxyphenylamino, p methoxyphenylamino, pyrrolidino, methylpyrrolidino, n butanoyl, n pentanoyl, n hexanoyl, n heptanoyl, n octanoyl, di 2 n octanoylethyl amino, m trifluoromethylbenzoyl, p trifluoromethylbenzoyl, N,N,N trimethylammonium tetrafluoroborate, N,N, diethyl N methylammonium tetrafluoroborate, N,N di n butyl N methylammonium tetrafluoroborate, N,N,N trimethylammonium tosylate, p toluenesulfonamide, and other similar groups. Substances of the above formula, Examples of solubilizing groups that can be selected include alkyl groups such as ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl pentyl branched and linear , hexyl branched and linear , heptyl branched and linear , octyl branched and linear , and the like. Specific molecules encompassed by the formula Various suitable resins can be selected for obtaining the toner composition of the present invention, typical resins including for example polyamides, polycarbonates, diolefins, epoxies, polyurethanes, vinyl resins and polyesters. Any suitable vinyl resin may be selected including homopolymers or copolymers of two or more vinyl monomers. Typical of such vinyl monomeric units include styrene, p chlorostyrene, vinyl naphthalene, unsaturated mono olefins such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene and the like diolefins such as 1,3 butadiene, isoprene and the like vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, vinyl fluoride vinyl esters inclusive of vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl butyrate and the like esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids including methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n butylacrylate, isobutyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, n octyl acrylate, 2 chloroethyl acrylate, phenyl acrylate, methylalpha chloroacrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and the like acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide, vinyl ethers, such as vinyl methyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, and the like vinyl ketones like vinyl methyl ketone, vinyl hexyl ketone, methyl isopropenyl ketone and the like vinylidene halides including vinylidene chloride, vinylidene chlorofluoride and the like N vinyl indole, N vinyl pyrrolidone and the like styrene butadiene copolymers, and mixtures thereof. As one preferred toner resin there can be selected the esterification products of a dicarboxylic acid and a diol comprising a diphenol. These materials are illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,655,374, the diphenol reactant being of the formula as shown in Column 4, beginning at line 5 of this patent and the dicarboxylic acid being of the formula as shown in Column 6. Other preferred toner resins include styrene methacrylate copolymers, and styrene butadiene copolymers, available from Goodyear Chemicals as Pliolites, polyester resins obtained from the reaction of bis phenol A and propylene oxide, followed by the reaction of the resulting product with fumaric acid, and branched polyester resins resulting from the reaction of dimethylterephthalate, 1,3 butanediol, 1,2 propanediol, and pentaerythritol. The toner resins identified herein are present for example in the toner composition in an amount of from about 85 percent by weight to about 99.9 percent by weight , and preferably in an amount of from about 90.0 percent by weight to about 96.0 percent by weight while the molecules comprised of the chromophore attached to the charge establishing group by a linking material are present in the toner composition in an amount of from about 0.1 percent by weight to about 15.0 percent by weight, and preferably in an amount of from about 4.0 percent by weight to about 10.0 percent by weight. Illustrative examples of carrier particles that can be selected for mixing with the toner composition of the present invention include those substances that are capable of triboelectrically obtaining a charge of opposite polarity to that of the toner particles. Accordingly, the carrier particles of the present invention are selected so as to be of a negative polarity, causing the toner particles which are positively charged to adhere to and surround the carrier particles. Illustrative examples of carrier materials include granular zircon, granular silicon, polymethyl methyl methacrylate, glass, steel, nickel, iron ferrites, silicon dioxide, and the like. Additionally, there can be selected as carrier particles nickel berry carriers as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,847,604. These carriers are comprised of nodular carrier beads of nickel, characterized by surfaces of reoccurring recesses and protrusions thereby providing particles with a relatively large external area. The selected carrier particles can be used with or without a coating, the coating generally comprising polyvinylidene resins, terpolymers of styrene, methylmethacrylate, and a silane, such as triethoxy silane, tetrafluoroethylenes, other fluorocarbon polymers, and the like. The diameter of the carrier particles can vary, generally however these materials are from about 50 microns to about 1,000 microns in diameter, enabling the carrier particles to possess sufficient density and inertia to avoid adherance to the electrostatic images during the development process. The carrier particles can be mixed with the toner particles in various suitable combinations, however, from about 1 part per toner to about 10 parts to about 200 parts by weight of carrier are mixed. The toner and developer compositions of the present invention can be prepared by a number of known methods, including melt blending the toner resin particles, and the chromophore molecule of the present invention, followed by mechanical attrition. Other methods include those well known in the art such as spray drying, melt dispersion, extrusion, dispersion polymerization, and suspension polymerization. In one dispersion method, a solvent dispersion of the resin particles, and dye molecule are spray dried under controlled conditions to result in the desired product. Toner compositions prepared in this manner result in a positively, or in some instances depending on the carrier selected, a negatively charged toner composition. More specifically thus toner compositions containing the dye charge control compounds described herein can be prepared by blending the dye molecule into the resin by extrusion. Thus a physical mixture of colorant and resin is fed into a known twin screw extruder at feed rates of from about 10 grams minute. to about 30 grams minute, and preferably from about 18 grams minute to about 25 grams minute. The temperature of the extruder barrel is maintained at about 130 The triboelectric charge present on the toner resin particles depends primarily on the charge establishing group selected, generally however this charge is from about 10 microcoulombs per gram to about 100 microcoulombs per gram, and preferably from about 20 microcoulombs per gram to about 60 microcoulombs per gram. The toner and developer compositions of the present invention may be selected for use in developing images in electrostatographic imaging systems, particularly colored images, on various suitable imaging surfaces capable of retaining charge such as those surfaces where a negative charge resides on the photoreceptor. The imaging method comprises contacting the electrostatic latent image with the developer compositions of the present invention followed by transferring the resulting image to a suitable substrate, and optionally permanently affixing the image by heat, or by exposure to solvent vapor. Examples of layered organic photoreceptors that can be selected as the imaging members include those comprised of transport layers and photogenerating layers, reference U.S. Patent 4,265,990, and other similar layered photoresponsive devices. Useful photogenerating layers include those comprised of trigonal selenium, metal phthalocyanines, metal free phthalocyanines, vanadyl phthalocyanines, squaraine pigments, and azo pigments, while examples of charge transport layers encompass the diamines as disclosed in U.S. Patent 990, hydrazones, and the like. A preferred photoresponsive device useful in the present invention contains a supporting substrate such as aluminum, a photogenerating layer of trigonal selenium, about 75 to 80 percent by volume dispersed in about 20 to 25 percent by volume of a polyvinylcarbazole resinous binder, and an amine transport layer with about 50 percent by weight of the amine molecule N, N diphenyl N,N bis 3 methylphenyl 1,1 biphenyl 4,4 diamine, dispersed in a polycarbonate resinous binder 50 percent by weight. This photoconductive device is negatively charged rendering the positively charged toner compositions of the present invention highly useful for development of latent electrostatic images contained on the surface thereof. The cyan charge enhancing dyes of the present invention can be prepared by a number of known procedures including the reaction of for example 1,4 diaminoanthraquinone 2,3 dicarboximide with primary amines. The dicarboximide reactant is prepared from bromaminic acid, sodium salt as described for example in German patent publication DE 3003 656. Moreover the dicarboximide composition can be prepared by the hydrolysis of 1,4 diamino 2,3 dicyanoanthraquinone as described in U. S. Patent 2,628,963. Other cyan charge controlling molecules can be obtained by reaction transformations on the functional group attached to the linker, or spacer molecule, including the conversion of alcohols to esters, to sulfonates, and the like the conversion of amines to amides, sulfonamides, quaternary ammonium salts and the like. The formation of the quaternary ammonium salts can be effected as detailed in US Patent 2,701,801. Further the cyan charge controlling molecules can be prepared as described in US Patent 2,701,801, wherein there is disclosed the preparation of N N ,N dimethylaminopropyl 1,4 diaminoanthraquinone 2,3 dicarboximide by reacting 1,4 diaminoanthraquinone 2,3 dicarboximide and N,N dimethyl 1,3 propane diamine. The yellow charge enhancing dyes of the present invention can be prepared by the reaction of 1, 5 dichloroanthraquinone with thiophenols, including thiophenol, para amino thiophenol, para methoxythiophenol, and the like. Other yellow dyes can be obtained by the transformations of the functional groups attached to the thiophenol group. The magenta charge enhancing dyes of the present invention can be prepared by the reaction of 1 amino 2 bromo 4 hydroxyanthraquinone, with primary amines. Other magenta dyes can be obtained by the reaction of the functional group attached to the linker substituents, including the conversion of amines to amides sulfonamides, quaternary ammonium salts, and the like.

The following examples are being supplied to further define embodiments of the present invention, it being noted that these examples are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the present invention. Parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The triboelectric charge of toner composition involved were determined by blow off measurements on developer compositions containing the toner, concentration of about 1 to about 6 and carrier particles concentration from about 94 to about 99 by weight . Blow off measurements were then performed on the developer mixtures roll milled for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours as indicated. The equilibrium triboelectric charge varies from about 10 microcoulombs per gram to about 80 microcoulombs per gram and preferably from 20 microcoulombs per gram to 40 microcoulombs per gram, depending on the choice of charge controlling group attached to the dye chromophore.
