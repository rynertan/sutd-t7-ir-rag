# Radiation image recording and reproducing method and radiation image storage panel employed for the same.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording and reproducing method comprising steps of causing a stimulable phosphor to absorb a radiation hav ing passed through an object or radiated by an object, exposing said stimulable phosphor to an electromagnetic wave having a wavelength within the range of 450 800 nm to release the radiation energy stored therein as light emission, and detecting the emitted light, in which said stimulable tnhosphor is a divalent europium activated complex halide phosphor having the formula I M
