# Solvent soluble organopolysilsesquioxanes, processes for producing the same, and compositions and semiconductor devices using the same.

## Abstract
An organopolysilsesquioxane having lower alkyl groups and alkenyl groups and, if necessary, aryl groups and or hydrogen atoms bonded as the side chains can be produced by adding water to a solution of a lower alkyltrihalosilane, an alkenyltrihalosilane, and, if necessary, an aryltrihalosilane and or a trihalosilane in an organic solvent, and heating the resulting mixture. The aforesaid organopolysilsesquioxane can be used for forming a patterned surface protecting layer or insulating layer for a semiconductor device, optionally in the form of a mixture with a compound which generates a crosslinking reaction active species upon irradiation with light or ionizing radiation.
