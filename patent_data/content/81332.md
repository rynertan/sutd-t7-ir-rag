## Description
PROCESS FOR MAKING STARCH FLOCCULANTS OF IMPROVED EFFICIENCY This invention relates to a novel hydrolyzed starch composition, particularly wheat, corn and potato starch compositions, and processes for making and using the same. It is, of course, known to hydrolyze starch by the addition of various metal salts to starch dispersions.For example, US A 3,977,897 Wurzburg, Ut al., issuedAugust 31, 1978, Class 127 71 describes the heating at moderate temperature of an aqueous suspension of starch granules and an inorganic salt to obtain a non chemically inhibited starch. GB A 516,294 Samuel et al. acceptedDec. 28, 1939 relates to starches modified with inorganic salts or other agents which are agitated in aqueous suspension at elevated temperature with a neutral hydrated metallic salt until a thick and gummy paste is obtained. In the present invention, however, an improved flocculating agent, particularly for sludge suspension, is obtained by heating an aqueous suspension of the starch admixed with lime and alum until maximum viscosity is obtained and then a metal salt, such as a phosphate salt, is added and hydrolysis effected. More particularly, this invention relates to the discovery that hydrolyzed starches are a more effective flocculant in destabilizing dilute as well as thick sludge suspensions when the starch is hydrolyzed in a specific manner e.g., by heating an aqueous dispersion comprising about 4 to about 12 starch solids, lime and alum until maximum viscosity is obtained, adding a metal salt and finally effecting hydrolysis by additional heating. As a result of the process of the invention the hydrolyzed starch obtained provides a more rapid flocculation. The improved hydrolyzed starch is useful with any aqueous suspension which is to be flocculated, particularly aqueous colloidal suspensions containing either clay minerals or metal oxides hydroxides which are formed in large volume during mining operations.These suspensions are known as slimes and are formed, typically as phosphate slimes or like materials produced in the mining of copper, nickel and titanium. Similarly, in coal and tar sands minings, the mining effluent typically contains dilute or thick clay mineral suspensions. In order to properly dispose of these voluminous mining discharges, regardless of their source, flocculants have conventionally been employed to destabilize these suspensions and thus permit the effective separation of water from the solids. In one particular aspect, this invention relates to the treatment of tailing pond water obtained from the hot water extraction process for treating bituminous sands, such as Athabasca tar sands, and, more particularly, to the treatment of the water and clay containing effluent discharged from such a process with a hydrolyzed wheat, corn or potato starch. Tar sands which are also known as oil sands and bituminous sands are sand deposits which are impregnated with dense, viscous petroleum. Tar sands are found throughout the world, often in the same geographical area as conventional petroleum. The largest deposit, and the only one of present commercial importance, is in the Athbasca area in the northeast section of theProvince of Alberta, Canada. This deposit is believed to contain over 700 billion barrels of bitumen. For comparison, this is just about equal to the word wide reserves of conventional oil, 60 of which is found in the middle east. The processing of these tar sands has been described in detail in various publications and in copending Canadian application S.N. 338,920, filedOctober 31, 1979 and copending U.S. application S.N.934,560 filed August 17, 1978 in the names of RaymondN. Young and Amar J. Sethi, which disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference. The problems associated with tar sands extraction result primarily from the clay minerals content of the tar sands. In the hot water extraction process, most of the clays become dispersed in the process streams and traverse the circuit, exiting in the tailings. The amount of process water input is fixed by both the clay content of the feed and the need to control viscosity of the middlings stream and the amount of water required for middlings viscosity control represents a large volume relative to the volume of the ore itself Upon disposal, clays settle only very, very slowly and thus the process water component of tailings is only partially available for reuse via recycle.That which cannot be recycled represents a net accumulation of tailings sludge. The pond water problem makes it necessary to devise long term economically and ecologically acceptable means to eliminate, minimize, or permanently dipose of the accumulation of liquid tailings or sludge. Flocculation of the drag stream in order to improve the settling characteristics thereof has been proposed and practised in the prior art. In flocculation, individual particles in this case clay particles are united into rather loosely bound agglomerates or flocs. The degree of flocculation is controlled by the probability of collisions between the clay particles and their tendency toward adhesion after collision.Agitation increases the probability of collision and adhesion tendency is increased by the addition of flocculants. As aforestated, the sludges being treated in accordance with this invention are aqueous colloidal suspensions containing either clay minerals or metal oxides hydroxides which are formed during mining operations. For sake of illustration, and simplicity only, the following description will be directed to a colloidal clay suspension obtained from bituminous tar sands mining. However, it will be understood that this invention is directed generally to the destabilization of all such suspensions. As aforementioned, the flocculant preferably is prepared from a wheat, corn or potato starch which has been hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis is achieved by first heating a mixture of the starch, lime and alum in the form of an aqueous suspension at about 800C until maximum viscosity is achieved. This is readily done by measuring the viscosity during the heating step with a rotating type viscosimeter and when the increasing viscosity begins to fall, immediately adding an inorganic salt, e.g. a phosphate salt. After the salt is added, additional heating at about 950C is effected and the mass is held on temperature for about one hour.The starch should be present in an amount of about 4 gm to about 12 gm per 100 ml of water, and preferably about 6 g. It has been found that when more than about 12 gm 100 ml is used proper mixing is not achieved. The salt which is added at maximum viscosity will be in the amount of from about 50 of the stoichiometric to about a stoichiometric amount with respect to the line Ca OH 2 . An amount of about 65 of stoichiometric has been shown to be quite satisfactory and is preferred. The term stoichiometric amount means the amount of salt based on the amount of line used which will produce the insoluble sa1t i.e., CaAlP04 with trisodium phosphate, alum and lime . Preferably the lower amount will be used as this will give a very significant reduction in flocculation time.The amount of alum in the system will be from about 5 to about 15 by weight of the starch, the preferred amount being about 10 Among the salts which may be employed for this purpose are salts of metals such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, calcium, and aluminium. The respective anions may be sulphates, acetates, chlorides, nitrates, chlorates, bromides, odds, thiocyanates, phosphates and the like. Particularly effective for purposes of this invention, as applied to tar sands tailings ponds, is trisodium phosphate Na3P04.12H20 . In carrying out the above procedure, an insoluble salt is formed in situ as the starch mixture is mixed after the salt addition. Thus, for example, when the preferred trisodium phosphate is added at the point of maximum viscosity of the starch, lime and alum mixture, insoluble CaAlPO4 is formed during the subsequent heating stage. This resulting salt should desirably be present in amounts of from about 10 to 30 grams per 100 grams of starch and preferably from 15 to 20 grams per 100 grams of starch. Reference is now made to the drawing where the experimental data with a wheat starch are given for various procedures. The curves shown give the settling time for tailings from pond water from Athabasca tar sands processing. In the test procedures used, the height of the tailings in graduated cylinders is observed before and after the dosage of 100 ppm of tailings. As can be seen from curve No. 1, when no flocculant is used, settlement of the tailings does not begin until about the second day and proceeds slowly for another one half day before settlement accelerates. Curve 2 shows the flocculation obtained when a trisodium phosphate salt is added in an amount stoichiometric to the lime at 200C prior to heating. As can be seen, a significant beneficial effect on reducing settling time is obtained by this usual prior art technique. Curve 3 illustrates the process of the invention whereby the trisodium phosphate salt is added in a stoichiometric amount at the point of maximum viscosity obtained by heating the starch, lime and alum mixture to about 800C. In this case an improved flocculation is obtained as shown by the curve which shows no lag time in the start of settlement, and within about one day drops to about 40 of the original height and continues to settle slowly thereafter. Curve 4 shows the result of using a large amount of the trisodium phosphate salt 150 of the stoichio metric amount of the lime and it is seen that the beneficial effects of the flocculant are very signifi cantly reduced. Curve 5 shows the preferred process of the invention where about 65 of the stoichiometric amount of the trisodium phosphate salt based on the lime is used and here the curve shows not only an immediate settlement occurring, but also a reduction of the height to only about 25 of the initial height in about 6 hours.
