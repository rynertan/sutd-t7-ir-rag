# PHASE CORRECTION CIRCUIT FOR A PHASE MODULATION SYSTEM.

## Abstract
In the reproduction of carrier waves form PSK signals by means of a tracking filter 12 , there are utilized two kinds of filters 21 and 22 which have wide an narrow equivalent noise band widths, respectively, so as to provide two output points a and b producing different output signals having different equivalent noise band widths. The phase difference between the output signals from the output points a and b is detected by a phase detector 23 . The detected phase error is used to shift the phase of the signals at the output point a by means of a phase shifter 24 thereby improving phase skipping characteristics and transient response characteristics. Further, the result of the phase detection is utilized to effect change over of channels or inversion of phase of demodulation base band signals or both.
