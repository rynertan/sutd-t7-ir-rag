# METHOD FOR MAKING DIRECT NEGATIVES AND DIRECT MASTERS BY ELECTROEROSION RECORDING

## Abstract
An electoerosion recording medium for generation of direct negatives or direct masters comprises a conventional support on which is deposited a thin conductive layer, and a protective overlayer comprising a crosslinked binder. The overlayer contains a solid conductive lubricant and optional ly a particulate scouring agent to inhibit electrode fouling during writing. Preferably a hard base layer is esent between the support and the conductive layer. The specification describes a method of making a direct negative or direct offset by an electroerosion process using the foregoing recording medium, said method comprising selectively electro eroding the conductive layer and thereby selectively simultaneously removing the crosslinked polym er layer.
