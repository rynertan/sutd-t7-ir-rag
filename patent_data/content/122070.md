# Video signal processing apparatus for video tape recorders.

## Abstract
A video signal processing apparatus used for a video tape recorder is disclosed. In the apparatus, the chrominance signal is up converted in a frequency converter 30 , digitalised in an A D converter 32 and phase shifted in a recording block 40 and, in a reproducing block 26 , phase shifted in the opposite direction in a reproducing block 26 , filtered by a comb filter, compensated against jitter, and up converted to the original chrominance signal in the frequency converter 30 . Both the recording block 40 and the reproducing block 26 may be digitalised or only the reproducing block 26 may be digital ised. The digital chrominance signal processing circuit includes an AD converter, a digital phase shifter, a digital comb filter, a digital jitter compensator, and a DA converter.
