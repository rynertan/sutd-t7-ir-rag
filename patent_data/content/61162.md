## Description
CEPHALOSPORIN DERIVATIVES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSCONTAINING THE SAME, AND PRODUCTION THEREOF This invention relates to cephalosporin derivatives represented by the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 is a lower alkyl group, and acid addition salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing said cephalosporin derivatives or acid addition salts thereof as active ingredients, methods of producing said cephalosporin derivatives, and methods of producing said pharmaceutical compositions. Cephalosporins in general are poorly absorbed through the digestive tract and therefore are administered by injection. As a result of intensive research to find out orally administrable cephalosporin derivatives, the present inventors have found 1 that the above mentioned novel cephalosporin derivatives I are absorbable through the digestive tract to a satisfactory extent and can rapidly be hydrolyzed in vivo under the action of enzymes, whereby the ester moiety of the substituent at the 4 position of the cephem ring structure is hydrolyzed and cephalosporin derivatives I are thereby converted to the corresponding unesterified species namely the compounds having a free carboxyl group at the 4 position , namely that oral administration of cephalosporin derivatives I results in high blood levels of those unesterified species that have an excellent antibacterial activity, which high blood levels can be retained for a prolonged period of time, 2 that conversion of cephalosporin derivatives I into acid addition salts thereof results in improved absorbability and at the same time in stabilization of cephalosporin derivatives I and facilitation of the isolation procedure and of the production of pharmaceutical preparations for oral administrations, 3 that cephalosporin derivatives I and acid addition salts thereof in the crystalline hydrate form, especially the crystalline hydrate of the hydrochloride of that compound of general formula I in which R1 is methyl, are excellent in stability and therefore are more preferable as drugs, 4 that specific epimers of said cephalosporin derivatives I are superior in absorbability through the digestive tract, and 5 that, when cephalosporin derivatives I or acid addition salts thereof are administered orally in the presence of organic acids, the absorbability of cephalosporin derivatives I or acid addition salts thereof is much increased. The present invention has been completed on the basis of these findings. Thus, the invention provides 1 cephalosporin derivatives I and acid addition salts thereof, 2 orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria, which compositions contain at least one member selected from the group consisting of cephalosporin derivatives I and acid addition salts thereof, 3 a method of producing cephalosporin derivatives I or acid addition salts thereof, which comprises reacting a compound of the general formuls II shown hereinafter with a compound of the general formula III shown hereinafter or reacting a compound of the general formula IV shown hereinafter with a compound of the general formula V shown herein after, and 4 a method of preparing orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria, which comprises uniformly mixing a cephalosporin derivative I with an organic acid. Referring to general formula I , the lower alkyl group represented by R1 may be either straight chained or branched and preferably contains 1 4 carbon atoms. Thus, preferred examples are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl and tert butyl. Cephalosporin derivatives I may occur as hydrates, as the case may be. Such hydrates are covered by the present invention. Preferred hydrates are hemihydrate to trihydrate, especially hemihydrate and monohydrate. It is preferable that cephalosporin derivatives I are in the acid addition salt form on the part of the aminothiazole moiety thereof. Any pharmaceutically acceptable acids which can form salts with said aminothiazole moiety may be used as acids for forming said acid addition salts. Examples of such acids are such mineral acids as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phsophoric acid and nitric acid, and such organic acids as oxalic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid and toluenesulfonic acid. Among said acid addition salts preferred is the hydrochloride, especially in the form of a crystalline hydrate, preferably hemihydrate or monohydrate. Whereas cephalosporin derivatives I each includes syn and anti geometric isomers with respect to the oxyimino moiety thereof, the syn form is preferred in the practice of the present invention. The aminothiazole moiety of cephalosporin derivatives I may take the iminothiazoline form, which is a tautomeric form, as the case may be. It goes without saying that such embodiment is also covered by the present invention. Cephalosporin derivatives I each contains three asymmetric carbon atoms marked with 1, 2 and 3 in general formula I and consequently includes several optical isomers. An advanced research made on these compounds by the present inventors has successfully led to 1 isolation of two optically active species of a compound represented by the formulaEMI4.1 which species are due to the asymmetric carbon atom marked with 3, one species ereinafter Epimer A having the specific rotation of 26 48 c l, methanol and the D other hereinafter Epimer B having the specific rotation 26 of D 113 c l, methanol , and acid addition salts of each, and has revealed 2 that acid addition salts of Epimer A are more excellent in absorbability through the digestive tract and at the same time more stable and 3 that acid addition salts of Epimer A may occur as crystalline hydrates e.g. hemihydrate and monohydrate , which have good stability and therefore may preferably be used as drugs. The present invention also covers such Epimer A andEpimer B as well as acid addition salts thereof. Cephalosporin derivatives I can be produced, for example, by the following method. Thus, they can be produced by reacting a compound of the general formulaEMI4.2 wherein R1 is as defined above and R2 is H or amino protecting group, or a reactive derivative thereof with a compound of the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein X is an atom or group reactive with a carboxylic acid or a reactive derivative thereof, eliminating the protective group R2 if 2 is such. Reffering to X in general formula III , said reactive atom or group is, for example, a halogen atom or a group of the formula B SO3 B being an alkyl or substituted aryl group . The alkyl group represented by B is preferably a lower alkyl group containing 1 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl or n butyl, and the substituted aryl group is preferably a lower C1 4 alkyl substituted phenyl group, such as p tolyl. Examples of said halogen atom are chlorine, bromine and iodine. Ref fearing to R2 in general formula II , any protective groups which can be removed when necessary may be used. Examples of the protective group which are usable in many cases are 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2 methylsulfonylethyloxycarbonyl, tert butoxycarbonyl, chloroacetyl and trityl. Preferably, compound II is subjected to the reaction in the form of a reactive derivative although compound 11 may be used as it is. The reactive derivative of compound II is a reactive derivative with respect to the carboxyl group thereof and includes reactive derivatives commonly used in esterification reactions, such as inorganic salts, for example alkali metal salts e.g. sodium salt, potassium salt , and organic salts, for example organic amine salts e.g. triethylamine salt . The reaction of compound II in the salt form with compound III is preferably carried out under cooling so as to avoid formation of the byproduct A2 isomer. The reaction can easily be carried out in the presence of a solvent which does not interfere with the reaction, such as d dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphoro triamide, acetone or acetonitrile. After the esterification reaction, the protective group is eliminated as necessary from the protected amino group by a conventional method known per se to give cephalosporin derivatives I . Compounds III are generally known compounds and can be prepared by conventional method. Cephalosporin derivatives I can also be produced, for example, by reacting a compound of the general formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, or a reactive derivative thereof with a compound of the general formulaEMI6.2 eliminating the protective group R2 if R2 is such. Compound IV is used in the free carboxylic acid form or as a reactive derivative thereof. Thus, the free acid or such a reactive derivative thereof as a salt e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, triethylamine or pyridine salt , an acid halide e.g. acid chloride, acid bromide , an acid anhydride, a mixed acid anhydride e.g. with a substituted phosphoric acid e.g. dialkylphosphoric acid or an alkyl carbonic acid e.g. monoethyl carbonic acid , an active amide e.g. amide with imidazole or an ester e.g. cyanomethyl ester, 4nitrophenyl ester is subjected to the acylation. In cases where compound IV is used in the free acid or salt form, the use of an adequate condensing agent is preferable and usable condensing agents are, for example, such dehydrating agents as N,N disubstituted carbodiimides e.g. N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and azolide compounds e.g. N,N carbonyldiimidazole, N,N thionyldiimidazole .When such a condensing agent is used, the reaction presumably proceed via a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid. The reaction is carried out generally in an inert solvent.Examples of the solvent are water, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, chloroform, benzene, methylene chloride, ethylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, N,N dimethylformamide, pyridine, other organic solvents, and mixtures of these. The reaction is preferably carried out at room temperature or under cooling 20 C to Ooh . Compound V can be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of the general formulaEMI7.1 wherein R3 is H or an amino protecting group, or a reactive derivative thereof with compound III . Referring to R3 in general formula VI , the aminoprotecting group includes per se known amino protecting groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl, 2 thienylacetyl, 2 furylacetyl, D 5 amino 5 carboxyvaleryl, trityl and phthalimido. It is preferable that compound VI is subjected to the reaction as a reactive derivative thereof e.g. alkali metal salt, such as sodium salt or potassium salt, alkaline earth metal salt, such as calcium salt, triethylamine salt, pyridine salt . For preventing formation of the byproduct n2 is onier , this reaction is preferably carried out under cooling. The presence of a solvent which does not interfere with the reaction e.g. dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphorotriamide, acetone, acetonitrile may facilitate the progress of the reaction. It is preferable in carrying out the reaction that R3 in general formula VI is an amino protecting group. In this case, the reaction of compound VI with compound III gives compound V in which the amino group in the 7 position is protected. The protective group can be eliminated by a per se known method of eliminating protective groups. As the method of eliminating said protective group, there may be mentioned, for removal of benzyloxycarbonyl, 2thienylacetyl, 2 furylacetyl and D 5 amino 5 carboxyvaleryl, for instance, the method comrising iminochlorination with phosphorus pentachloride, followed by decomposition with methanol, and for elimination of trityl, for instance, the method comprising treatment with an acid e.g. formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid , and for removal of phthalimido, for instance, Ing Manske s method using hydrazine. The thus obtained cephalosporin derivatives I can be converted into acid addition salts thereof by a per se known method. The crystalline hydrate of the hydrochloride of cephalosporin derivative I can be prepared, for example, by dissolving cephalosporin derivative I in an aqueous hydrochloric acid containing solution or the hydrochloride of cephalosporin derivative I in an aqueous solvent or an aqueous hydrochloric acid containing solution and then causing the crystalline hydrate of the hydrochloride of compound I to crystallize out. As the aqueous solvent, there may be used water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent such as an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol , acetone, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran. As the aqueous hydrochloric acid containing solvent, there may be used aqueous hydrochloric acid or a mixture of aqueous hydrochloric acid and an organic solvent such as mentioned above. Referring to the aqueous hydrochloric acid containing solvent to be used in producing the crystalline hydrate, the aqueous hydrochloric acid generally has the hydrochloric acid concentration of 0.01 to 20 , preferably 0.1 to 10 . The dissolution of cephalosporin derivative I or the acid addition salt thereof in an aqueous solvent or an aqueous hydrochloric acid containing solvent is generally effected at lO0C to 700C, preferably at 200C to 5O0C. The hydrate is caused to crystallize out, for example, by 1 concentrating under reduced pressure preferably at room temperature to an adequate volume or 2 dissolving with heating and then cooling or 3 adding an adequate amount e.g. 5 to 15 of sodium chloride, filtering off the insoluble matter and allowing the filtrate to stand and cool. The thus formed crystalline precipitate of the hydrate can be collected by a per se known means, for example by filtration. When the thus obtained crystalline hydrate is dried sufficiently and submitted to elemental analysis, the analytical data indicate that the product is the hydrate.Observation under a polarization microscope and X ray diffraction pattern ascertain that the product is crystalline.Furthermore, the infrared absorption spectrum of the product is different from that of the amorphous hydrochloride of cephalosporin derivative I . The former spectrum presents sharp peaks. Epimer A, Epimer B, and acid addition salts thereof are prepared, for instance, by the following procedures Procedure 1 One weight part of that species of cephalosporin derivative I which is optically inactive with respect to the asymmetric carbon atom marked with 3 hereinafter optically inactive compound I or the hydrochloride thereof is dissolved in 20 to 120 weight parts of 0.1 2t aqueous hydrochloric acid with heating and then allowed to crystallize out, whereupon Epimer B in the hydrochloride form crystallizes out. Epimer A hydrochloride remains in the mother liquor and can be recovered in the crude form, for instance by concentrating the mother liquor. The crude Epimer A hydrochloride is recrystallized from 40 60 times its weight of 0.1 0.58 aqueous hydrochloric acid to give purified Epimer A hydrochloride. Epimer A and Epimer B each in the hydrochloride form, which has crystallized out, can be collected by a per se known means, for example by filtration. Generally, the Epimer A hydrochloride obtained by this procedure occurs as hemihydrate crystals of the hydrochloride whereas the Epimer B hydrochloride occurs as monohydrate crystals of the hydrochloride. When such hydrates are dissolved in a polar solvent such as ethyl acetate and then a non polar solvent such as isopropyl ether is added, the respective epimers can be recovered each as a solid precipitate in the non hydrated form.Procedure 2 One weight part of an acid addition salt especially hydrochloride of optically inactive compound I is dissolved in 20 weight parts of 95 ethanol with heating and then caused to crystallize out, whereupon Epimer B in the acid addition salt form crystallizes out. Epimer A in the acid addition salt form remains in the mother liquor and can be recovered in the crude form, for example by concentrating the mother liquor.The crude acid addition salt of Epimer A can be purified by recrystallization from 10 times its weight of 95 ethanol. Procedure 2 is suited for preparing Epimer A hydrochloride and Epimer B hydrochloride. The thus obtained Epimer A hydrochloride generally occurs as hymihydrate crystals and the Epimer B hydrochloride generally occurs as monohydrate crystals.Procedure 3 Epimer A can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formulaEMI11.1 with an optically active isomer of compound III .Procedure 4 Epimer A can be isolated by recrystallizing cephalosporin derivative I from an organic solvent. The organic solvent includes, among others, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, ethers such as diethyl ether and isopropyl ether, acetone, chloroform, and mixtures of these. The thus obtained acid addition salt of Epimer A or B can be converted to Epimer A or B having the free amino group by neutralization with sodium hydrogen carbonate, for instance. Conversely, Epimer A or B having the free amino group can be converted to an acid addition salt by a per se known means. The orally administrable therapeutic compositions for treating infectious diseases caused by bacteria in accordance with the present invention can be prepared by diluting the thus produced cephalosporin derivatives I or acid addition salts thereof with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient by a per se known procedure. The dilution is carried out in a conventional manner, for example by mixing. The carrier or excipient includes starch, lactose, sucrose, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate, among others. In accordance with the present invention, it is preferable to add an organic acid, preferably an aliphatic carboxylic acid to the pharmaceutical composition. The addition of such acid facilitates absorption of cephalosporin derivatives I and acid addition salt thereof into the blood circulation.Any organic acid, especially aliphatic carboxylic acid species that are pharmaceutically acceptable may be used. Generally, aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1 4 carboxyl groups, preferably 2 3 carboxyl groups, and optionally having a hydroxyl group or hydroxyl groups are used. The aliphatic carboxylic acid thus includes tartaric acid, malic acid, glucuronic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, etc. The advantages of solid preparations containing cephalosporin derivatives I or acid addition salts thereof, such as tablets, capsules, granules and pills, as compared with liquid preparations containing the same are that the former preparations are more convenient to handle and that cephalosporin derivatives I and acid addition salts thereof are more stable in the former preparations. However, it has been found that, when made into solid preparations, cephalosporin derivatives I and acid addition salts thereof are poor in absorbability after oral administration as compared with liquid preparations. When the above mentioned organic acid is added to such solid preparations, solid preparations excellent in absorbability after oral administration are obtained.Therefore, the significance of the above mentioned organic acid becomes apparent when it is added to such solid preparations. Said organic acid is used in the therapeutic compositions for treating bacteria caused infectious diseases in accordance with the invention in an amount sufficient to increase absorption of cephalosporin derivatives I after oral administration. The amount depends upon the kind of cephalosporin derivative I and other factors. Generally, it is 0.1 20 moles, preferably 1 10 moles, per mole of cephalosporin derivative I or an acid addition salt thereof, or generally 5 500 mg, preferably 10 250 mg, per dose. The bacteria caused infectious disease treating compositions according to the invention may contain other additives, if desirable. Preferred examples of such additives are binders e.g. starch, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, crystalline cellulose , lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate, talc and disintegrators e.g.carboxymethylcellulose, talc . The solid preparations may also contain alkali metal carbonates e.g. sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate , alkali metal hydrogen carbonates e.g.sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate , etc.After mixing the ingredients, the mixture can be formed into dosage forms suited for oral administration, such as capsules, powder, granules and dry sirup, by per se known means. When the bacteria caused infectious disease treating compositions according to the invention are administered orally, the active ingredients, namely cephalosporin derivatives I or acid addition salts thereof, are rapidly absorbed through the digestive tract and, immediately after absorption, are hydrolyzed in vivo under the action of enzymes to give the corresponding unesterified cephalosporins or salts thereof. Said unesterified cephalosporins and salts thereof have an excellent antibacterial activity. They are markedly active against such gram positive bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus and such gram negative bacteria as Escherichia coli, Rlebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii. Moreover, the unesterified cephalosporins and salts thereof are very low in toxicity. Therefore, the bacteria caused infectious diseasetreating compositions according to the present invention can be used as therapeutic agents, for example for bacteriacaused diseases e.g. suppurative diseases, respiratory tract infection, biliary tract infection, urinary tract infection in humans and warm blooded animals e.g. dog, cat, cattle, horse, rat, mouse . The dose of cephalosporin derivatives I or salts thereof depends on subjects, severity of symptom and other factors, In treating suppurative diseases in human adults, for instance, cephalosporin derivatives I or salts thereof are administered orally at a dose of about 1 20 mg as the corresponding unesterified cephalosporins per kg body weight three or four times per day.
