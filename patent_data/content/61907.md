## Description
SECONDARY AMINES The present invention relates to derivatives of ethanolarnine which have anti ohesity and or bypo glycaemic and or anti inflammatory and or platelet aggregation inhibiti on activity.,to processes for..their production and to their use in medicine. European Patent Application No. 79301197.4 Beechams discloses compounds of formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, hydroxyl, hydroxymethyl, methyl, methoxy, amino, formamido, acetarnido, methylsulphonamido, nitro, benzyloxy, methylsulpbonylmethyl, ureido, trifluoromethyl or p methoxybenzylamino Rê is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl R is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl 4. R is a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R5 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, or a carboxylic acid group or B salt, ester or amide thereof R6 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl R7 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl X is oxygen or a bond and Y is C16 alkylene or a bond, which possess anti obesity and or hypoglycaemic activity. It has now been discovered that a class of novel aminoethanolamine derivatives have anti obesity and or hypoglycaemic and or anti inflammatory and or platelet aggregation inhibition activity. This activity is coupled with low cardiac stimulant activity for particular members of the class. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI2.1 and salts thereof wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl R2 is hydrogen or methyl R3 is phenyl optionally substituted with one or two of the following fluorine, chlorine, bromine, trifluoromethyl or C16 alkyl or is benzofuran 2 yl n is 1 or 2 X is C1 15 straight or branched alkylene. A1 is hydrogen, C16 alkyl, or optionally substituted benzyl A2 is hydrogen, C16 alkyl, or optionally substituted benzyl, and E is hydrogen, halogen, C1 6 alkoxy , C1 6 alkyl, or mono or di Çl alkylamino. A preferred sub group of compounds within those of formula I are those wherein R is phenyl optionally substituted by one of the following fluorine, chlorine, bromine or trifluoromethyl, X is C1 6 straight or branched alkylene, A1 is hydrogen or C 6 alkyl, Aê is hydrogen or C1 6 alkyl, and E is hydrogen. Preferably, n is 1. Preferably, R1 is hydrogen and R2 is methyl.Preferably one of AÚ or Aê is hydrogen and the other is methyl. Suitably X represents a methylene group. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I include acid addition salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid or acetylsalicylic acid. The salts of compounds of formula I need not be pharmaceutically acceptable as they are also useful in the preparation of other compounds of formula I and in the separation of stereoisomers of compounds of formula I when the salt ion is also optically active. Compounds of formula I have at least one asymmetric carbon atom, ie the one bearing the hydroxyl and R3 groups, and, when R1 and R2 are different, the carbon atom bearing R and R is also asymmetric. The compounds may therefore exist in at least two and often four stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula I whether free from other stereoisomers or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion and thus includes, for instance, racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Preferably, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group and R3 has the R configuration. The most potent compounds of formula I are those wherein RÚ and Rê are different and both asymmetric carbon atoms are in the R configuration. The absolute configuration of any compound of formula I may be determined by conventional X ray crystallographic techniques. It is believed that, in the 13C n.m.r. of compounds of formula I wherein one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is methyl, the diastereoisomer having the greater anti obesity activity is that for which the signal of the methyl group carbon atom appears at higher field the lower numerical value when expressed in ppm in d6DMSO solution.The paired resonances often appear at approximately 20 ppm less active and slightly below 20 ppm more active down field from tetramethylsilane. Other paired resonances can occur for the carbon atoms attached directly to the ethanolamine nitrogen atom and the carbon which carries the hydroxyl group and R3. Again the paired resonances of the more active diastereoisomer of the investigated compounds appear at the higher field position. The present invention also provides a process for producing a compound of formula I by reducing a compound of formula II EMI5.1 wherein RÚ,R ,E and n are as defined in relation to formula I, R8 is a group X NAÚ Aê or Y Z wherein Awl, A and X are as defined in relation to formula I and Y is a bond or C1 14straight or branched alkylene, and Z is cyano orEMI5.2 or Y is C1 15 straight or branched alkylene and z isEMI5.3 wherein As is C15 alkyl carbonyl. R9 is a group Rê as defined in relation to formula I or together with R10 forms a bond RlO is hydrogen, benzyl or together with R9 or Rll forms a bond R11 is hydrogen or together with R12 forms an oxo group or together with R10 forms a bond R12 is hydrogen or together with R11 forms an oxo group R13 is hydroxyl or together with R14 forms an oxo group R14 is hydrogen or together with R13 forms an oxo group, provided that there is no more than one oxo group and no more than one bond represented by any of R9 to R14 and optionally thereafter forming a salt, of the compound of formula I so formed and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . When there are two or more reducible groups in the compound of formula II these may, generally, be reduced separately in any order or simultaneously. Salts of compounds of formula I may be produced directly using the appropriate compound o formula II or may be produced from the free base of formula I by conventional means. Free bases of formula I may be obtained directly or from the corresponding salt by conventional means. The compounds of formula I so produced may be purified by conventional means such as crystallisation and or chromatography. The aforementioned reductions may be effected by conventional chemical methods, such as reduction using a complex hydride, for instance lithium aluminium hydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride, aluminium amalgam or boranemethyl sulphide or by catalytic hydrogenation using catalysts such as palladium on charcoal, or plaillull for instance, as platinum oxide. Catalytic hydrogenation is conveniently effected using hydrogen gas at about 1 atmosphere pressure when platinum is used as catalyst and at medium to high pressure, conveniently 50 to 100 psi, when a palladium catalyst is used. Such hydrogenations may be conducted in conventional hydrogenation solvents such as a lower alkanol, for instance ethanol and at any convenient, non extreme temperature. It is generally most suitable to use a slightly raised temperature such as 300C to l000C, for example 400C to 8O0C. The desired compound may be isolated from the reaction mixture by evaporation of the filtered solution. The initially obtained product may be purified by conventional means, for example by chromatography, crystallisation or the like. Reduction by sodium borohydride is conveniently effected in a lower alkanolic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. The reaction is generally carried out at ambient or reduced temperatures of, for example 0 to 300C. Reduction by lithium aluminium hydride is. conveniently effected in a dry, ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at ambient or elevated temperature. The desired compound may be obtained, after reduction with either sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride by hydrolysis of the reaction mixture, extraction into a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate and evaporation.The initially obtained product may be purified as outlined hereinbefore. In particular aspects, the present invention provides processes for producing compounds of formula I by reducing a compound of formula IIA EMI8.1 or reducing a compound of formula lIB EMI8.2 or reducing a compound of formula IIC EMI8.3 or the N benzyl derivative thereof, or reducing a compound of formula lID EMI9.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIE EMI9.2 wherein RÚ, Rê, R ,AÚ, Aê and R8 Y, E, Z, and n are as defined in relation to formulae I and II . The present invention also provides a process for producing a compound of formula I by reacting a compound of formula III EMI9.3 with a compound of formula IV EMI9.4 wherein R1 R2, R3g, A1,A2,X and n are as defined in relation to formula I and optionally thereafter forming a salt, of the compound pf formula I sow formed and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . This reaction is conveniently effected in a solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. Compounds of formula II may be produced by reacting a compound of formula V EMI10.1 wherein R11 R2, E, R8 and n are as defined in relation to formulae I and II and R15 is hydrogen or benzyl with a compound of formula VI R3 W vi wherein W containsa.group which is capable of reacting with the amine of formula V thus forming a compound of formula II . Typical examples of compounds of formula VI are EMI11.1 or its hydrate or hemiacetal cf a lower alkanol EMI11.2 wherein V is a halogen atom, preferably bromine EMI11.3 wherein L is a leaving group, such as halogen or preferably tosyloxy.andEMI11.4 The compounds of formulae VIA and VIC are only suitable for reacting with a compound of formula V when R15 in formula V is hydrogen. It will be appreciated that when R8 is a group A1A2and R15 is hydrogen, the reaction of a compound of formula V with the compound of formula VID or III produces a compound of formula I directly, this being identical to the reaction between compounds of formulae III and IV above. Conventional conditions suitable for use with the particular compound of formula VI may be used for this reaction. Thus the reaction of a compound of formula VIA with a compound of formula V is conveniently conducted at elevated temperature under conditions resulting in the removal of the water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent such as benzene, under reflux and azeotropically to remove the water using a Dean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compound of formula VIB with a compound of formula V is conveniently conducted in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile or butanone, at an elevated temperature, for instance under reflux The reaction of a compound of formula VIC with a compound of formula V is conveniently conducted under standard peptide formation reaction conditions. The reaction of a compound of formula VID with a compound of formula V is conveniently conducted in a solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide at elevated temperature, preferably 50 C for about 3 days. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula V is conveniently conducted in a solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. A particularly preferred process for the production of compounds of formula II comprises reacting a compound of formula VII EMI13.1 with a compound of formula VIII EMI13.2 wherein RÚ, R8, E and n are as defined in relation to formula I or II R is hydrogen or together with R is oxo and R17 is a leaving group, such as halogen, or preferably tosyloxy, or together with R16 is oxo. The reaction of a compound of formula VII with a ketone of formula trIII is conveniently effected under conditions which result in the removal of ater formed during reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and azeotropically to remove the water using aDean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compound e of a cosllpound foirnula ill with S compound of formula VIII wherein R17 is a group L is conveniently effected in a solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide at elevated temperature, preferably at about 50 C for about two to three days. It is often convenient to prepare the compound of formula II and then use it in situ without isolation to produce the required compound of formula I . The intermediates of formulae III , IV , V , VI and VII may be produced by conventional methods. Those compounds of formula I having only one asymmetric carbon atom i.e. when R1 and R2 are the same may, if desired, be resolved into enantiomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Those compounds of formula I having two asymmetric carbon atoms may be separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate or benzene. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in Topics in Stereochemistryµ Vol 6, Wily Interscience, 1971 AllingerN L and Eliel, WoLo Eds . Any desired enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials of known configuration. Thus, by using single enantiomers of the compounds of formula III and IV a required enantianer of the corresponding compound of formula I can be obtained. Similarly, the reaction of a single enantiomer of a compound of formula V with a single enantiomer of formula VIC below will result in a single enantiomer of a compound of formula IID above.The latter may be reduced to a compound of formula I without altering the stereochemical configuration thereby affording a single enantiomer of the compound of formula I . Reaction of a connound of formula V with a single enantiomer of a copound of formula VID will give a single enantialpr of a compound of formula I directly.Thus, for instance, the R enantiomer of a compound of formula VID or VIC , when reacted with the R enantianer of a compound of formula V directly or indirectly affords the RR enantiomer of the desired compound of formula I . Reduction of a single optical isomer of a compound of formula IIE , wherein Y Z is the only reducible moiety, results in the production of the corresponding single optical isomer of a compound of formula I . Thus, for example, reduction of the R,R stereoisomer of a compound of formula IIE wherein Y is a bond and Z isEMI15.1 affords theR,R optical isomer of a compound of formula I wherein X NAlA is CH2NHCH3. Many of the reductions described in relation to compounds of formula II directly involve the asymmetric, or potentially asymmetric carbon atoms and consequently result in the formation of mixtures of stereoisomers.Thus reduction of a single enantiomer of a compound of formula IIA , IIB or IIC will result in the formation of a pair of enantiomers of a corresponding compound of formula I whereas reduction of a racemic mixture of enantiomers of a compound of formula IIA IIB or TIC will result in the formation of a mixture of all four enantiomers of the corresponding compound of formula I .Such mixtures may be separated into pairs of enantiomers and or resolved into single enantiomers as described above. A compound of formula I , or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, where appropriate, hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or amide thereof, where appropriate, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor As used herein the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable embrace compositions and ingredients for both human and or veterinary use.

The mice were placed in boxes through which air was drawn and the oxygen content of the air leaving the boxes was measured. The energy expenditure of the mice was calculated for 21 hours after dosing from the volume of air leaving the boxes and its oxygen content, following the principles described by J,B. de V. Weir,J. Physiol. London 109, 1 9, 1949 . The food intake of the mice was measured over this same period of 21 hours. The results are expressed as a percentage of the mean food intake or rate of energy expenditure of the mice dosed with water.

Blood samples were then obtained from each mouse at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes. Compounds that produced a significant P 0.05 reduction on blood glucose, compared with control mice given water, at any time interval, were considered active.The area under the blood glucose curve over the 2 hour period after the administration of the glucose was calculated for each compound and compared with the value for control animals.COMPOUND OF DOSE REDUCTION IN AREA UNDEREXAMPLE NO. p mol kg BLOOD GLUCOSE CURVE 1 2.5 29 2 2.5 24 4 12.5 31 8 12. 5 52 10 100.0 49 12 2.5 37 14 12.5 46 15 2.5 19 16 2.5 33 23 50 26 24 50 17 25 2.5 41 26 2.5 53 27 2.5 10 V ANTI INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY The method used is based on that described byG. Tonelli et al Endocrinology, 77, 625 634, 1965 . An inflammation is induced in the rat ear by the application of 50 ul of a 1 solution of croton oil in tetrahydrofuran, test compounds being dissolved in the irritant vehicle.After 6 hours the inflammation is assessed by killing the animals and weighing the ears. Topical anti inflammatory activity of a compound is generally considered to be shown when a significant 5 level reduction in ear weight is seen compared to non drug treated control.COMPOUND OF DOSEEXAMPLE NO. mg RATEAR ACTIVITY 2 0.5 Active 8 2 Active VI PLATELET AGGREGATION INHIBITION ACTIVITYMale CFLP mice ca 20g, n 11 or 12 were dosed orally with compound or vehicle controls after an overnight fast.
