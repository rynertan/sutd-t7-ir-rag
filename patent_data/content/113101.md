This invention relates to 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 SR8 1 methyl 1 carbadethiapen 2 em 3 carboxylic acid esters I .which are useful as orally active antibiotics EMI1.1 wherein R is a pharmaceutically acceptable ester moiety consistent with oral delivery and R is substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cyclic alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, having 1 6 carbon atoms, aryl such as phenyl or heteroaryl such as pyridyl wherein the substituent or substituents are selected from phenyl, pyridyl, cyano, fluoro, chloro, hydroxy, alkylthio such as methylthio, arylthio such as phenylthio, methoxy, phenoxy, alkoxycarbonyl such as methoxycarbonyl, acetoxyl, N methylcarbamoyl, N methylcarbamoyloxy andN acylamino. R and R8 are additionally defined below. This invention also relates to processes for the preparation of such compounds I pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and to methods of treatment comprising administering such compounds and compositions when an antibiotic effect is indicated. There is a continuing need for new antibiotics. For, unfortunately, there is no static effectiveness of any given antibiotic, because continued wide scale usage selectively gives rise to resistant strains of pathogens. In addition, the known antibiotics suffer from the disadvantage of being effective only against certain types of microorganisms. Accordingly, the search for new antibiotics continues. This search is particularly acute for orally active antibiotics. Thus, it is an objection of the present invention to provide a novel class of orally active antibiotics which are useful in animal and human therapy. These antibiotics are active against a broad range of pathogens which representatively include both gram positive bacteria such as S. aureau, Strep.pyogenes, and B. subtilis, and gram negative bacteria such as E. coli, Proteus morganii, Serratia, andKlebsiella. Further objects of this invention are to provide chemical processes for the preparation of such antibiotics pharmaceutical compositions comprising such antibiotics and to provide methods of treatment comprising administering such antibiotics and compositions when an antibiotic effect is indicated.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONA.
