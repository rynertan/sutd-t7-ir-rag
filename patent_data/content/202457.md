# Deceleration and pressure sensitive proportioning valve with high pressure damping.

## Abstract
A proportioning valve assembly 10, 210 in a housing 12, 212 is pressure responsive to control the flow of fluid to a wheel brake cylinder. The proportioning valve 20, 220 is connected to a fluid channel 31, 231 opening into a reservoir 13, 213 , a second valve 34, 234 being disposed in the channel 31, 231 and being engaged by an inertia sensitive ball 40, 240 located either on a ramp 17 or within a recess 235 of the second valve 234 . The ball 40 is responsive to deceleration of the vehicle and moves up the ramp 17 , or the ball 240 moves multi directionally from the recess 235 to be both longitudinal and lateral decelera tion responsive. Movement of the ball 40, 240 permits the second valve 34, 234 to close and prevent fluid communica tion between the fluid reservoir 13, 213 and the proportion ing valve 20, 220 in order to vary the outlet pressure of the proportioning valve 20, 220 in response to deceleration or cornering of the vehicle. The proportioning valve 20, 220 includes a second piston 80, 280 which has a plunger end 82, 282 that extends within the channel 31, 231 and a bore 303 of a sleeve 301 . The sleeve 301 has an orifice 307 to restrict fluid pressure flow from the bore 30 around the plunger end 282 and through the orifice 107, 307 to the channel 31, 231 . The sleeve 301 , orifice 307 , and plunger end 82, 282 provide damping of second piston when sudden high pressure applications occur, and thereby eli minate the occurrence of wheel lock up.
