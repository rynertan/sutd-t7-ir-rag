# Polyphenylene ether resin compositions containing polyolefin in high amount.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic compositions of polyphenylene ether resin and diblock or radial teleblock copolymer of an alkenyl aromatic compound and a conjugated diene which can be hydrogenated containing polyolefin resin in large amount are described. The compositions are moldable into articles which do not exhibit the brittleness and tendency toward delamination often associated with use of large amounts of polyolefin.
