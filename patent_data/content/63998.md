# Dual master cylinder.

## Abstract
A dual master cylinder of the kind comprising spring loaded tilt valves for controlling fluid communication bet ween a fluid reservoir and the variable volume pressure chambers, said tilt valves being normally held in an open position by valve actuators carried on the respective pistons of the master cylinder as long as said pistons are in a non braking position. According to this invention, each valve actuator 182, 210 includes an annular spring seat 142, 156 slidably mounted on the usual valve actuating collar 86, 114 and held in engagement with a surface 16, 158 bounding the correspondig pressure chamber 64, 108 by a first spring 88, 116 interposed between said spring seat and the cor responding piston 62, 106 , and a second, weaker spring 152, 162 interposed between said spring seat and actuat ing collar to space them apart from each other. For use in dual circuit braking systems for automotive vehicles.
