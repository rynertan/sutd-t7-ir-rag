## Description
RECOVERY OF NI.TRATED AROMATIC COMPOUNDS FROM NITRATION WASHLIQUORS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The nitration of aromatic compounds, especially benzene, to produce mononitrated aromatic compounds, which process. is h.ereinafter sometimes discussed with reference to the nitration of benzene to produce mononitrobenzene, hereinafter referred to as nitrobenzene, is widely practiced commercially, particularly for the manufacture of aniline. Conventional commercial processes for nitrobenzene ordinarily utilize either a batchwise or continuous addition of a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, commonly referred to as mixed acid, to the aromatic charge mater ial. Representative processes for the nitration of aromatic compounds. are disclosed by Castner in U.S. Patent No.2,256,999 and Alexanderson etal. in U.S. Patent Nos, 4.021,498 and 4,Q9.1,042, respectively. In these processes, and others, after the nitration re.acti.on is. completed, the spent acid, i.e,, the mixed acid essentially completely depleted of nitric acid, is s.eparated from the nitroaromatic compound layer. The crude nitroaromatic compound layer is then washed with 1 water, or 2 water containing ammonia or an alkali metal base, to remove. water soluble acidic impurities and oxidation by products sucb as e.g., dinitrophenols and picric acid,. The resulting wash waters, saturated with. nitroaro matic compound, are normally either sewered directly, or steam stripped, or absorbed on carbon to recover residual nitroaromatic compound before being discharged. The direct sewering of the wash waters results in a 0.1 to 0.5 loss of yield of nitroaromatic compound and furthermore, since the effluent is not treated, it is toxic to aquatic life, The treatment of this effluent in a biological effluent treatment plant, however, is difficult because nitrated aromatic compounds are also toxic to the bacteria used therein. In view of the harmful nature of e.g., nitrobenzene, and the difficulty in treating effluents containing e.g., nitrobenzene, in modern commercial practice the nitrobenzene is usually stripped from the wash liquors witS steam, This method reduces the nitrobenzene in the effluent wash water to a level acceptable for subsequent biological effluent treatment, but it is at the expense of about 4Q pounds of steam per pound of nitrobenzene recovered.Thus, the stripping operation is costly in equipment and energy, SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an improvement in a process for the monitration of an aromatic compound with a mixed acid comprising nitric and sulfuric acid, wherein the resulting nitrated aromatic compound phase produced thereby, is recovered and washed with. an aqueous solution of ammonia or an alkali to remove therefrom by product water soluble, ammonium or alkali metal salts, wherein the wash liquor which contains said ammonium or alkali metal salts, and a minor amount of nitrated aromatic compound, is contacted with from 0.05 to 0.5 part, by volume, of the aromatic compound being nitrated, per part, by volume, of wash liquor to extract said nitroaromatic compound therefrom, and recycling the resulting solution to a aromatic compound nitration reaction. In this manner, essentially all of the nitroaromatic compound, which is entrained in the wash liquor is recovered, Hence the process of this invention is a practical and economic way to recover nitroaromatic compounds for recycling to an aromatic mononitration process DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The improved process of the present invention is not limited to any particular nitration conditions, or any particular aparatus, or assemblage thereof, or to any particular method of operation. The process may be carried out batchwise, or continuously. For purposes of illustration, a process conducted continuously in the manner described byAlexanderson etal. C 0421 above, is used. The process is carried out continuously using a series of four continuous overflow, stirred tank nitration reactors. Thus, for example, a benzene feed stream at room temperature and a mixed acid feed steam, heated to a temperature in the range 800C to 1200C, are fed into the bottom of the first of the reactors to form a nitration reaction mixture which overflows and is fed into the bottom of the second reactor and so forth.The mixed acid is formed continuously in a mixing tee by blending 68.5 percent sulfuric acid and 60 percent nitric acid in amounts to provide a mixed acid containing 62.58 sulfuric acid, 5.2 nitric acid, and 32.3 water. the contents of the reactors are kept under a positive pressure sufficient to keep the benzene in the liquid state The residence time in each reactor will depend on the volume of the reaction mixture and on the feed rate and on the reaction temperature. The reaction mixture overflowing from the fourth. nitration reactor is continuously fed to a continuous phase separator where the spent acid phase is separated from the crude nitrobenzene phase. The spent acid phase is then reconcentrated using a vacuum flash evaporator, utilizing the heat generated in the reaction.The concentration of the spent acid using flash evaporators, or other means, is old and well known. The crude nitrobenzene phase is then fed continuously into a multi stage, counter current, washer extractor where, in the first stage, acidic comp√ènents, such as entrained sulfuric acid, dinitrophenols and picric acid, are neutralized by washing one part by volume of the crude nitro benzene phase with about 0.4 part by volume of wash water containing about 1 by weight, of an alkalizing agent such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, ammonium hydroxide, and the like. Sufficient alkalizing wash water is used to form the alkali or ammonium salts of any acids, or nitrophenols, present therein. The resultant first alkaline wash layer is separated from the crude nitrobenzene layer which is then washed with water in a second stage to remove any residual alkaline wash liquor.The washed nitrohenzene is recovered from the resultant second alkaline wash layer which is then combined with the first alkaline wash layer to produce a wash liquor which is transferred to a third stage where it is extracted with aboutO.Q5 to 0.5 part, by volume, of benzene, preferably about 0.1 to 0.4 part, by volume, of benzene per part by volume of the wash liquor, to recover essentially all of the nitrobenzene therein. Alternatively, the first alkaline wash layer per se may be extracted with the benzene without first being combined with said second alkaline wash layer and vice versa. The benzene extracts essentially no nitrophenols or picric acid from the wash liquor. The benzene layer is then recovered and is preferably used by recycling it to a reaction vessel where it is reacted with mixed acid to form nitrobenzene as described above. The temperature of the benzene used in the extraction step is not critical. However, it is preferable to carry out the extraction at about 35 450C. The degree of removal of the nitrobenzene from the wask liquor depends on the volume of benzene used. For example, using 0.1 part, by volume, of benzene per volume of liquor, 97.3 of the nitrobenzene is extracted, UsingQ.5 part, by volume, of benzene per volume of liquor, increases the amount of nitrobenzene extracted to 99.44 . The process described herein will function with any aromatic hydrocarbon or halogen substituted aromatic hydrocarbon which is not degraded by hot sulfuric acid and whose nitration product is also stable in the presence of hot aquev ous sulfuric acid, provided that the aromatic compound may be liquified at a temperature within the range of about 40 8Q0C, Thus, such aromatic compounds as benzene, toluene, dimethylbenzene , halobenzene, napthalene, methylnaphth alene., halonapththalene, halotoluene and halomethylnaphthalene may be used herein The following examples are set forth for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed as limitations in the. present invention except as set forth in the appended clams, All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Example 1 Benzene C1Q stoichiometric excess and mixed acid containing 5,2 nitric acd, 62,5 sulfuric acid and 32.3 water, are. continuously mixed and fed into the bottom of the first of four continuous overflow, stirred tank, nitration reactors, The benzene is fed at room temperature and the mixed acid is heated to 90 C. Pressure on the reactor is 65 psig, Following a residence time of 2.8 minutes in the first reactor, the reaction temperature is 132 C. L T 420C.i and conversion of nitric acid to nitrobenzene is 91 . The reaction mixture flows into the bottom of the second reactor and, following a residence time of 2,8 minutes, the temperature is 1350C, C 450C. and conversion is 98 . The reaction is continued in this manner so that the reaction mixture, following overflow from the third and fourth reactors after 2.8 minutes residence time in each reactor, has a temperature of 135.50C. and 136 C., respectively and a degree of conversion of 99 and 99.5 , respectively, Total residence time is 11.2 minutes. The flow from the fourth reactor is fed into a continuous separator, where the spent acid phase is separated from the crude introbenzene phase, The spent acid phaseoisothen reconcentrated to 68 sulfuric acid in a vacuum flash evaporator operating at 90 C. and 6Q mm Hg and recycled. The crude nitrobenzene phase is continuously fed to a multi stage, counter current, washer extractor, where in the first stage, entrained sulfuric acid, dinitrophenol, and picric acid are removed by contact with a 1 solution of caustic soda. The resultant first alkaline wash layer is then separated from the neutralized nitrobenzene which is then washed with water in a second stage. The resultant second wash layer is then separated from the neutralizer, washed nitrobenzene and combined with the first alkaline wash layer to produce a wash liquor which contains sodium salts of sulfuric acid, dinitrophenols, and picric acid, as well as residual nitrobenzene. This wash liquor is then extracted with benzene in a third stage, using 0,5 part, by volume, of benzene per part, by volume, of the wash liquor. The resultant aqueous phase is then separated and the remaining benzene phase, containing about 95 99 of the nitrobenzene originally present in the wash liquor, is recycled to a benzene nitration reaction. The neutralized, washed nitrobenzene is steam stripped to remove unreacted, excess benzene which is recovered and used in subsequent benzene extractions. Example 2 The process of Example 1 is carried out using amounts of benzene and mixed acid to produce 15,000 lbs. of crude nitrobenzene per hour, which requires 6,000 lbs. of 1 caustic soda per hour and 3,000 lbs. of water wash per hour.Analysis of the combined first and second wash layers wash liquor indicates that 39.75 Ibs. of nitrobenzene are carried into the wash liquor per hour. Extraction of the wash liquor with Q,5 part, by volume, of benzene per hour per part, by volume, of wash liquor per hour over a period of 8 hours resulted in the recovery of 316.219 lbs. of nitrobenzene,Based on an annual operating schedule of 8,000 hours, this amounts to e rEcovery of 316,219 lbs. of nitrobenzene per year Example 3 A synthetic wash liquor is prepared by adding sod ium hydroxide t3Q.0 grams and mononitrobenzene C100 mls hereafter abbreviated MNB, to distilled water t3000 mls , heating the mixture to 450C. and stirring for one hour, allowing the two phases to separate or 0.5 hour, and splitting off the excess MNB in a heated separatory funnel at 45 C. To the residual aqueous phase is added 2,4 dinitrophenol C25 mgs , hereafter abbreviated DNP, to provide a stock solution containing 1.606 mgs of MNB ml and 0.0096 mg of DNP ml. A portion 500 mls of the stock solution at 450C.and benzene C50 mls l at 230C. are charged to a roundbottom flask equipped with baffles and agitated for 0,5 hour while maintaining the temperature at 450C. The phases are then allowed to separate and are sampled, directly following which the volume of the remaining solution is measured in a separatory funnel at 350C. Analysis shows that the benzene phase contains no defectable DNP and 16.9 mg of MNB ml and the aqueous phase contains 0.00924 mg of DNP ml and 0.043 mg of MNB ml. Table I shows the percentages of the total DNP andMNB in each phase.
