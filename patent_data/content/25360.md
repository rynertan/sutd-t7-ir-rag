# Method and apparatus for cleaning electrodes.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for cleaning an electrode removed from an electrolytic bath, to remove bath residue from the electrode. The method comprises the step of vibrating the electrode to shake loose the bath residue. The apparatus is used to clean the electrode 13 when it is part of a support assembly 11,12 . The apparatus comprises holding means 14,22,36 for holding the support assembly 11,12 , resilient mounting means 16 resiliently mounting the holding means and vibrating means 32 oparable to via rate the holding means together with the electrode support assembly and electrode.
