# Aqueous drilling fluid.

## Abstract
An aqueous drilling fluid comprises an aqueous clay dis persion and a water loss reducing amount of a carboxylic functional polyampholyte or a salt of it having an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.5 dl g and prepared from a at least one carboxylic functional monomer b at least one cationic containing monomer containing quaternary ammonium, phosphonium or sulfonium ion and c optionally, non ionic monomer. Such fluids may be circulated during drilling of wells in subterranean formations.
