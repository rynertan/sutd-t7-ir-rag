## Description
Dispensing ContainerThe present invention relates to a dispensing container for liquids, syrupys, flowable powders, granular and pasty sub stances, creams, greases, cosmetics and similar products, comprising an annular wall having two axially spaced open ends and a central longitudinal axis, a stationary end wall sealingly closing one of said open ends, product outlet means in the region of said stationary end wall, a movable end wall sealing received in said other open end and move ble lenghtwise of said axis towards said stationary end wall to effect dispensing of product through said outlet means, said movable end wall including a general planar cen ter part having a maximum dimension in direction normal to said axis which is smaller than the cross sectional dimen sion bounded by the inner surface of said annular wall and an annular frusto conical part surrounding said center part having maximum dimension in direction normal to said axis which is at least slightly greater than the cross sectional dimension bounded by said inner surface.There does already exist a container suitable to contain the above mentioned products, comprising an annular shell, a stationary end wall, a movable end wall in center gene rally planar and laterally of frusto conical shape, such as described in the Utility Industrial Model application entitled CONTAINER WITH CYLINDRICAL SHELL AND MOVABLEEND WALL filed in Italy with n.60990 B 81 on November 25th 1981 in the name of the undersigned.The purpose of the container in accordance with the present invention is to achieve all advantages of the previous inven tion i.e. to be leakproof to a high degree, to preserve the product contents from the air contact before dispensing, to make dispensing operation very easy and to be relatively inexpensive to produce , and furthermore to improve the tightness between the movable end wall and the shell prior to movement of the movable wall towards the stationary end wall and to make the container tamperproof in the sense that any attempt at tampering will be immediatly visually apparent.The dispensing container in accordance with the present invention comprises an annular wall having two axially spaced open ends and a central longitudinal axis, a stationary end wall sealingly closing one of. said open ends, product outlet means in the region of said stationary end wall, a movable end wall sealing received in said other open end and movable lenghtwise of said axis towards said stationary end wall to effect dispensing of product through said outlet means, said movable end wall including a generally planar center part having a maximum dimension in direction normal to said axis which is smaller than the cross sectional dimension bounded by the inner surface of said annular wall and an annular frusto conical part surrounding said center part having a maximum dimension in direction normal to said axis which is at least slightly greater than the cross sectional dimension bounded by said inner surface and an annular bead externally surrounding said annular wall proximal to the other of said open ends and means cooperating with said bead for establishing a seal therewith prior to movement of said movable end wall towards said stationary end wall and said movable end wall further including a portion connecting said frusto conical part and said cooperating means and defining a weakened zone along which said cooperating means is separable from said frustoconical part.According to a currently preferred embodiment the coopera ting means is an annular strip portion having an inner annular face which overlies and clasps on outer annular face of said bead so as to establish a seal therewith until separation of said cooperating means along said weakened zone.According to a further embodiment said bead has a straight transverse asymmetrical cross section and includes an outer annular surface having a first portion which is closer to said other open end and more extended lenghtwise of said axis, and a second portion farther from said other open end and less extended lenghtwise of said axis, said second portion being inclined to said axis at a second angle greater than a first angle at which said first portion is inclined to said axis.In another embodiment said annular wall is of metallic material and said bead is constituted by an edge portion of said annular wall which bounds said other open end and is bent outwards to the exterior of said container.In a further embodiment said annular wall is of synthetic plastic material and said bead is formed of one part there with.In another embodiment said bead is a discrete element which is fixedly connected to said annular wall.In an improvement of said embodiments said strip portion includes a pull tab for facilitating its separation from said frusto conical part.In a further improvement of said embodiments said strip portion includes a free edge axially spaced from said weakened zone, and a weakened line extending from said weakened zone to said free edge.One way of carring out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings, which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which Figure 1 is an axial cross section of a container in accordance with the present invention,Figure 2 is a side view of the same container.In this embodiment the entire container C is made of any suitable synthetic plastic material known from the prior art. The container has a cylindrical shell 1 of circular cross section which is integrally formed at one end with an external annular bead 2.The fixed end wall 3 may be of one piece with the shell 1, or be connected thereto in any manner known from the prior art. Its interior surface 3a is declined towards a product outlet 4 which may have a nozzle 5 controlled by any not illustrated device known from the prior art. The external surface 3b of the wall 3 is normal to the central longitudi nal axis of shell 1, so that the container C can stand perfectly upright. The other end of shell 1 is closed by a movable end wall 6, half of which is shown at left side of fig.1 in the position 6a which the end wall assumes prior to mounting on container C, and the other half of which is shown in the position 6b which the end wall assumes upon being installed on the container.The end wall 6 has a planar center part 7 which extends normal to central longitudinal axis of shell 1. The maxi mum diameter of part 7 is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of shell 1. Central part 7 is surrounded by an annular peripheral part 8 of frusto conical shape whose maximum diameter is in excess of the inner diameter of shell 1. Connected to the upper free edge portion of part 8 is an external band 9 along an annular line 10 at which the material thickness is much less than of parts 8 and 9. The parts 8 and 9 could be separate elements which are suitably connected by e.g. an annular foil strip 10 as a general rule they will, however, be of one piece with one another. The internal profile 9a of the shaped band 9 is similar or complimentary to the external profile of bead 2, except that the axial and trasverse dimension of the profile of band 9 are somewhat smaller than those of bead 2. Band 9 is also formed with a zone 12 of reduced material thickness, which extends across the band see fig.2 at an angle to the central longitudinal axis of shell 1 and merges into a tearstrip or tab 11 projecting from the band 9.To install the end wall 6 on the container after the latter is charged with the product to be dispensed , the end wall 6 is placed in the position 6a and pressure is than exerted against it in direction towards the shell 1 and the fixed end wall 3 until the end wall reaches position 6b. This causes the part 8 to undergo elastic deformation as it enters into the open end of shell 1 and then to press sealingly against the escape of product is thereby assured, not only during storage but also during dispensing of the product.Once the end wall 6 is in the position 6b, a pressure must be exerted upon the band 9 to deform it elastically so that it will adhere to and clasp the bead 2. This has the two fold purpose of forming another tight seal and, primarily, of anchoring the movable end wall 6 in such a manner that it cannot be moved to extract product from the container without rupturing band 9. The wall 6 cannot be removed to extract product from the container and then be superficially returned to tis position, without giving visual evidence of such tampering. Nor can the wall 6 be pushed towards wall 3 to effect dispensing of the product, without rupturing the band 9 by pulling tab 11 and thereby tearing off the band 9 along the line 12 and subsequently along the zone 10.Should any residual portions remain on the part 8 of band 9 and or the material forming the zone 10 after band 9 is pulled off, they will necessarily always remain outside the contact and sealing zone between wall 6 and shell 1and cannot, therefore, compromise the sealing effect in any way.It will be appreciated that various modifications are possible in the disclosed embodiment without thereby departing from the gist of the invention. For example the zone 10 could be omitted if present, it need not be continuously of reduced thickness. Instead, the material could be provided in this annular zone with dots, dashes or the like of reduced material thickness, or even with outright perforations, so long as the overall purpose is achieved of having the zone 10 offer a mechanical resistance which is so reduced as compared to that of the parts 8 and 9, that the part 9 can be torn off or otherwise separated from the part 8 along the zone 10. As for the bead 2, it is currently preferred that it have a straight transverse section with the upper part thereof more extended in vertical direction than the lower one, and with the lower part being more inclined relative to the longitudinal shell axis than the lower part. This facilitates clasping the interior border of the band 9.
