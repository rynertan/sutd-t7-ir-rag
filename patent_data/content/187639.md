## Description
This invention relates to novel piperazine derivatives, processes for production thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the piperazine derivatives as an active ingredient. More specifically, this invention relates to a 1 benzhydryl 4 cinnamylpiperazine derivative represented by the following formula I wherein R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or a methoxy group, and R² represents a hydrogen or fluorine atom, The cerebrovascular diseases can roughly be classified as intracranial hemorrhages such as intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral infarctions such as cerebral thrombosis or cerebral embolus, transient ischemic attack, and hypertensive encephalopathy. In these diseases, a disorder of cerculation of the brain parenchyma occurs owing to hemorrhage, thrombus, embolus, etc. within the brain, and leads to an insufficiency in glucose or oxygen which is an energy source for neuronal activity. This results in functional and organic disturbances in the ischemic area. Accordingly, drugs which supply glucose and oxygen to the ischemic area by increasing cerebral blood flow are effective for the treatment and prevention of these diseases. Previously, various drugs such as cinnarizing have been clinically used for the purpose of treating these cerebrovascular diseases and subsequent complications, preventing relapse, improving their after effects, etc. Belgian Patent No. 556791 and German Laid Open Patent Publication No. 1929330 disclose compounds corresponding to cinnarizine having various monosubstituents on the phenyl groups of the benzhydryl group and their application to allergic diseases and diseases of the circulatory system. In particular, a compound of the following formula, which has a common name flunarizine , is clinically used in the form of its dihydrocloride as a cerebrovascular drug having superior action and durability compared to cinnarizine. The laid open specification of EP 152799A laid open after the priority data of the present application discloses 1 bis 4 fluorophenyl methyl 4 3,4 dimethoxycinnamyl piperazine of the following formula and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel 1 benzhydryl 4 cinnamylpiperazine derivative or its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel 1 benzhydryl 4 cinnamylpiperazine derivative or its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt having an action of treating cerebrovascular diseases. Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing a novel 1 benzhydryl 4 cinnamylpiperazine derivative or its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. These objects and advantages of this invention are achieved in accordance with this invention by a 1 benzhydryl 4 cinnamylpiperazine derivative represented by the following formula I wherein R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or a methoxy group, and R² represents a hydrogen or fluorine atom, Specifically, the compounds of this invention are the following four compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The acid addition salts include, for example, salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid, and organic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid and citric acid. By animal experiments, the compounds of this invention have been found to show an excellent action of increasing cerebral blood flow. For example, in an experiment using dogs, the compounds of this invention have a stronger and longer lasting action of increasing cerebral blood flow than cinnarizine, a popular cerebrovascular disease treating agent, or flunarizine dihydrochloride, an improved drug of cinnarizine in intravenous administration see, Test Example 1 given hereinbelow . These facts indicate that the compounds of this invention are useful as agents for treating cerebrovascular diseases including therapeutic and prophylactic drugs . As indicated hereinabove, one object of this invention is to provide such drugs. The compounds of this invention can be produced, for example, by selectively reducing the compound represented by the following formula II via the following process and optionally converting the product I into its acid addition salt. In the formulae, R¹ and R² are the same as defined hereinabove. Specifically, the compound of formula I can be produced by suspending or dissolving the compound of formula II in a customary manner in a solvent such as diethyl ether, and treating the suspension or solution with an equimolar proportion, or a slight excess, of a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride or sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum hydride under ice cooling or at temperatures up to room temperature. The compound of this invention produced by the above process is isolated from the reaction product preferably in the form of an acid addition salt and purified. As required, it may be converted in a customary manner to a free base or other various acid addition salts The compound II can be produced, for example, by reacting 2,4 dimethoxy or 2,3,4 trimethoxycinnamic acid with benzhydrylpiperazine or bis 4 fluorophenyl methylpiperazine or its salt either directly or after converting the cinnamic acid to its halide, thereafter isolating the product in the form of an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride or a fumarate from the reaction mixture and purifying it, and converting the purified acid addition salt to a free base. The following pharmacological tests show the utility of the compounds of this invention.

Cinnarizine control compound . Flunarizine dihydrochloride control compound . The activity of increasing cerebral blood flow was measured by using the amount of vertebral blood flow as an index. Mongrel dogs of either sex body weight 11 to 14 kg four per group were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 30 mg kg, by intravenous injection , and the right vertebral artery was isolated from the surrounding tissues. A flow probe was attached to it and led to an electromagnetic flow meter MFV 2100 made by Nihon Kohden Co., Ltd. . The amount of blood flow was periodically measured see Meth and Find Exptl Clin Pharmacol, Each of the test compounds was administered in a dose range of 0.03 to 0.3 mg kg, and doses which increased the cerebral blood flow by 50 VBF ED₅₀ were calculated from the regression line. Furthermore, each of the test compounds was administered in a dose of 0.3 mg kg, and increases in vertebral blood flow were determined 1, 5, 10 and 20 minutes after the administration. The results are shown in Table 1. Acute toxicity The same compounds as used in Test Example 1 were tested. ddY strain male mice body weight 18 to 22g five per group were caused to fast 24 hours. Then, each of the test compounds was administered orally, and acute toxicity values LD₅₀ were determined. Each of the compounds was dissolved or suspended in a 2 tartaric acid solution containing 20 of dimethylacetamide, and orally administered to the animals. From the number of animals which died during seven days, the LD₅₀ values were calculated by using the Weil method. The results are shown in Table 1. The activity of compound A of the invention to increase cerebral blood flow was examined by intraduodenal administration. Compound A was dissolved in a 2 tartaric acid solution containing 20 dimethylacetamide, and administered intraduodenally to mongrel dogs of either sex body weight 11 18 kg, five per group in a dose of 1 mg kg. At 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after the administration, the increase of vertebral blood flow was measured in the same way as in Test Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2.
