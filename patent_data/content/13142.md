# Inorganic filler material containing a saturated hydrocarbyl pyro phosphate, polymer compositions containing such material as a filler and a method for their preparation.

## Abstract
An inorganic filler material which has improved compati bility characteristics with certain polymeric substrates is dis closed. This filler materiel is one which is treated with an effective amount, for such improved compatibility of a satu rated hydrocarbyl acid phosphate and or a saturated hyd rocarbyl acid pyrophosphate or an alkali metal or alkaline earth salt thereof. Polymeric compositions containing a polymer substrate and such filler are also disclosed.
