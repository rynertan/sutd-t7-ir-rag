# Registration mechanism for a multimagnification reproduction apparatus.

## Abstract
A flash exposure optical imaging system is provided which includes a light housing a movable top and bottom surrace. The top surface 6 contains a document platen, the bottom surface 10 a fixed, wide angle projection lens 12 . These surfaces are vertically translated past a fixed, central housing wall 8 to vary the system conjugate in response to changes in magni fication. In a preferred embodiment, a pair of elliptical cams 17 are rotated in response to position signals from a controller initiated by a magnification change. A pair of T bars 16 and linkage machanisms 15 are associated with these cams and their motion provides simultaneous vertical motions to the top and bottom housing surfaces, respectively. During the vertical excursion of the floor assembly, an additional horizontal motion is imparted to the lens 12 so as to maintain correct corner registration of the image of the document at the image plane 18 .
