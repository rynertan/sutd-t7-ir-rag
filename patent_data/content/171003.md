# FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR WITH COMPOSITE DRAIN REGION

## Abstract
In a field effect transistor, a drain region and a source re gion are constituted by at least a first impurity distributed re gion 14, 15 and a second impurity distributed region 16, 17 . The first impurity distributed region 14, 15 has a maximum im purity concentration at the surface of a semiconductor sub strate 1 , the second impurity distributed region 16, 17 has a maximum impurity concentration in the semiconductor sub strate 1 , and at least the second impurity distributed region 16, 17 is formed with a gate electrode edge as an impurity in troduced window edge. The semiconductor device has excel lent breakdown voltage property, excellent current gain pro perty, and very stable and uniform characteristics.
