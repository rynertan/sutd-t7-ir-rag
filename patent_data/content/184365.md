## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TREATMENT OF TUMORS IN MAMMALS While the treatment of cancer was once considered impossible, great strides have been made during the past ten years in controlling the ravages of this often fatal disease. Several drugs which contribute to the increasing rate of survival are now routinely used clinically. The most commonly employed antitumor agents include methotrexate, doxorubicin and the vinca alkaloids such as vincristine. However, research continues to develop more effective compounds with greater safety for subjects under treatment. This invention provides valuable improvements in the treatment of tumors. The present invention provides a method of treating susceptible neoplasms in mammals comprising administering to said mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of formula I EMI1.1 in which R1 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl orEMI1.2 R2 is a base defined by one of the formulaeEMI2.1 X is N or C R4 R3 iS hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl orEMI2.2 R4 iS hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, amino, bromo, fluoro, chloro or iodo each R5 independently is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Thus, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of susceptible neoplasms. The present invention also provides a novel compound of formula II EMI2.3 in which R6 is hydrogen or Cl C4 alkyl R7 is a pyrimidine or purine base of one of the formulaeEMI3.1 Q is N, C C2 C4 alkyl or C amino X is N or C R4 R8 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl R4 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, amino, bromo, fluoro, chloro and iodo or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with the proviso that R6 and R8, both may be hydrogen only when X is N. The present invention further provides a compound of formula III EMI4.1 in which R6 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl EMI4.2 a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Further, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula 11 or III , as defined above, which comprises a coupling a pyrimidine base of the formula R7H, or a protected derivative thereof, with a carbohydrate of formula IV, or a protected derivative thereof EMI4.3 in which the R7H pyrimidine base and R6 are as defined above and Leav is a leaving group, and if desired, removing any protecting group present to pro duce the pyrimidine base product and b if a formula III or formula II compound in which the base is a purine is desired, reacting with ammonia a corresponding purine nucleoside com pound in which a C 2 and or C 6 sub stituent of the purine portion of the compound is halogen, and, if desired, alkylating the product. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations useful for treating susceptible neoplasms in mammals comprising a compound of formulae II or III in combination with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient therefor. Further, there is provided a compound of formula II or III for use in the chemotherapy of a mammal. The compounds employed in the present invention are preferably prepared by reacting a D glyceraldehyde ketonide with a C1 C4 alkyl bromodifluoroacetate to afford an alkyl 3 dioxolanyl 2,2 difluoro 3 hydroxypropionate. The hydroxypropionate is hydrolyzed to a lactone which is protected and reduced to afford a 2 desoxy 2 , 2 difluororibose or xylose derivative. The hydroxy group of this compound is provided with a leaving group, and the resulting carbohydrate is coupled with an appropriate base. The resulting protected nucleoside is finally deprotected to provide the desired compound. The overall reaction scheme is illustrated as follows EMI6.1 wherein R10 and R11 independently are C1 C3 alkyl, Prot is a hydroxy protecting group and Leav is a leaving group. It generally is desirable to convert free hydroxy groups to protected hydroxy groups during coupling of the 2 desoxy 2,2 difluorocarbohydrate to a base. The protecting groups are those commonly used in synthetic organic chemistry. Chemists are accustomed to choosing groups which can be placed efficiently on hydroxy groups, and which can be removed easily when the reaction is complete. Suitable groups may be those described in standard textbooks, such as Chapter 3 ofProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry, McOmie, Ed.,Plenum Press, New York 1973 and Chapter 2 ofProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, JohnWiley Sons, New York 1981 . Hydroxy protecting groups commonly employed include formyl,EMI7.1 alkyl , 2 chloroacetyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, 4 nitrobenzyl, phenoxycarbonyl, C1 C4 alkyl such as t butyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, allyl, tetrahydrothienyl, 2 methoxyethoxymethyl, methoxyacetyl, phenoxyacetyl, isobutyryl, ethoxycarbonyl, and benzyloxycarbonyl.Silyl hydroxy protecting groups are particularly convenient because most are cleaved easily by contact with water or an alcohol. Such groups may include especially trimethylsilyl, as well as isopropyldimethylsilyl, methyldiisopropylsilyl, or triisopropylsilyl. The t butyldimethylsilyl group is a special case and is preferred as the protecting group in this synthesis it is more difficult to cleave, requiring a reagent such as a hydrohalic acid to remove it from the hydroxy groups. Ribose or xylose has a hydroxy group at the l position of its ring. In order to react the carbohydrate with the base, to form the compounds employed in this invention, a leaving group must be placed at the l position. The leaving groups are those typically used in organic synthesis. The preferred leaving groups are sulfonates, of which the most preferred is methanesulfonate. Other typical leaving groups such as toluenesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, isopropanesulfonate, 4methoxybenzenesulfonate, 4 nitrobenzenesulfonate, 2 chlorobenzenesulfonate, chloro and bromo also may be used. The carbohydrates employed in the synthesis of the compounds employed in the present invention are prepared by reacting a D glyceraldehyde ketonide of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein R10 and R11 are as defined above with a C1 C4 alkyl bromodifluoroacetate, preferably the ethyl ester. The preferred glyceraldehyde ketonide is the acetonide in which R10 and R11 are both methyl seeFischer and Baer, Helv. Chim. Acta. 17, 622 1934 .Ethyl bromodifluoroacetate was prepared first by Morel and Dawans, Tet. 33, 1445 1977 . The reaction of the ketonide and the haloacetate is carried out in the presence of an activated metal such as magnesium or preferably zinc. Activation is obtained most easily by applying ultrasonic energy to the reaction mixture. Activation by that means compensates for the presence of a small amount of water in the reaction mixture, avoiding the necessity to maintain anhydrous conditions, and also avoids the necessity to prepare and carefully store activated metals. However, if desired, the metal may be activated by the customary methods known in the art.Approximately an equimolar amount of metal is the most advantageous amount. The reaction has been performed in ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether, at moderate temperatures. However, other organic solvents which are inert to the reaction conditions may be used, including halogenated alkanes such as chloroform, dichloromethane, or trichloroethane, and aromatic solvents including benzene, toluene and the xylenes. Temperatures in the range of from about ambient temperature to about 1500C may be used temperatures from about ambient temperature to about 800C are preferred, however. Economicallyacceptable yields have been obtained in reaction times ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. One should note that the reaction is exothermic, and the mixture may need to be cooled, depending on the scale of the reaction and the rate at which the reactants are added. The product of the first reaction is an alkyl 3 dioxolanyl 2 , 2 difluoro 3 hydroxypropionate of the formulaEMI9.1 in which R10 and R11 are as described above. The ratio of the 3 R hydroxy intermediate to its 3 S hydroxy enantiomer is usually about 3 1. The 3 R hydroxy enantiomer has the proper stereochemistry to produce the ribose derivative in its natural configura tin, acid sb it is the desired enantiomeric product oS the first step. The 3 R hydroxy enantiomer can generally be separated cleanly from the 3 S enantiomer by chromatography on silica gel, eluting with chloroform containing 0.5 methanol. The hydroxypropionate, in either form, is hydrolyzed using very mild conditions to form the lactone of the formulaEMI10.1 Proper control of the hydrolysis step will cleave the ketonide function and the ester group, providing the lactone in a single step. The hydrolysis reagent preferably is a miIdly acidic ion exchange resin, of which Dowex 50W X12 Dow Chemical Company is most highly preferred. Other mild hydrolytic reagents may be employed although larger amounts of by products may be obtained. For example, aqueous acetic acid, or other relatively strong acids such as propionic acid, formic acid, chloroacetic acid, or oxalic acid may be used for the hydrolysis. The hydroxy groups of the lactone should be protected before its keto oxygen is reduced. The usual reaction conditions are used, depending on the protecting groups chosen. For example, the t butyldimethylsilyl group is most conveniently provided in the form of its trifluoromethanesulfonate, and the protection reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as lutidine, pyridine and the like. Acyl protecting groups such as acetyl, benzoyl and the like are added by reacting the lactone with an acylating agent such as an acyl chloride, bromide, cyanide or azide, or with an appropriate anhydride. The reactions are conveniently carried out in a basic solvent such as pyridine, quinoline or isoquinoline, or in a tertiary amine solvent such as triethylamine, tributylamine, or methylpiperidine.The reaction also may be carried out in an inert solvent, to which an acid scavenger, such as a tertiary amine, has been added. Acylation catalysts such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrrolidinopyridine may be used in the reaction, if desired. The acylation reactions which provide protecting groups on the hydroxy groups are carried out at moderate temperatures in the range of from 250C to 1000C. Such acylations also may be performed by acid catalyzed reactions of the appropriate carboxylic acids, in inert organic solvents or neat.Acid catalysts such as sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, or methanesulfonic acid may be used. Acyl protecting groups may also be provided by forming an active ester of the appropriate acid, for example esters formed by reaction with reagents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, acylimidazoles, nitrophenols, pentachlorophenol, N hydroxysuccinimide and l hydroxybenzotriazole. Protected groups of the ether type are produced by reacting the lactone with, for example, an appropriate diazo compound, such as diazomethane, phenyldiazomethane or a silyldiazomethane. Such reactions commonly are carried out in solvents including esters such as ethyl acetate, halogenated solvents including dichloromethane and chloroform, and ethers including diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran.The process is usually carried out at low temperatures from about 50 C to about OOC. Such ether forming reactions may also be carried out with the assistance of reagents such as trimethyloxosulfonium hydroxide, trimethylsulfonium hydroxide and trimethylselenonium hydroxide, in solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetone, or acetonitrile. The silyl protecting groups discussed above are placed on the hydroxy groups by the conventional methods, such as by reaction with the appropriate silylcarboxamide or bis substituted silyl carboxamide, or an appropriately substituted silazane. Suitably substituted silyl methanesulfonates, toluenesulfonates and the like are useful also. An equivalent amount of a base is usually necessary in the reaction mixture, unless a basic solvent is used in the reaction. When the hydroxy groups have been protected, the keto oxygen of the lactone is reduced to the alcohol, forming the protected 2 desoxy 2,2 difluororibose or xylose. The most preferred reducing agent is diisobutyl aluminum hydride, used at a low temperature in the range of about 1000C to 200C. The reduction must be performed very carefully to avoid conditions so vigorous that the ring is opened at the oxygen atom. Other metal hydrides, such as the widely used lithium aluminum hydride, can also be used for the reduction, but it is necessary to keep the temperature quite low and to assure that the hydride is destroyed before the temperature is allowed to rise above about 200C. Accordingly, a solvent with a very low freezing point, such as toluene, must be used in the reduction step.Other solvents, of course, can be used, including lower alkanols, especially ethanol, or ethers such as diethyl ether. To obtain efficient reaction with the base, an appropriate leaving group must be placed at the l position of the carbohydrate. The preferred leaving group is methanesulfonyl, and the compound with this leaving group is readily provided by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of an equivalent amount of a suitable acid scavenger such as triethylamine and the like. Other sulfonyl leaving groups are provided in the same way by reaction with the appropriate sulfonyl halide. When a chloro or bromo leaving group is to be used, it is frequently advantageous first to make the acetate derivative, as by reaction with acetic anhydride, or another source of acetyl groups, in the presence of an equivalent amount or more of an acid scavenger. The acetate group then is displaced, at a low temperature such as about 500C to about OOC, with gaseous hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride. Because the gaseous hydrogen halide may tend to remove the protecting groups, especially silyl protecting groups, operating this step at low temperatures and adding the hydrogen halide slowly in small increments is necessary. The compounds employed in the present inven tion having a base portion which is composed of a purine substrate are preferably synthesized by reacting the hydroxy analog of the carbohydrate having protecting groups at the 3 and 5 position with the base in the presence of diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine. Standard modifications are then made to the purine substrate if desired. The bases used to form the compounds employed in the present invention are known to those skilled in the art, and no discussion of their synthesis is neces sary. The primary amino groups present on some of the bases, however, should be protected before the base is coupled with the carbohydrate. The usual amino protecting groups are employed, including silyl groups such as have been discussed, as well as such typical groups as t butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 4 methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, formyl, or acetyl. Converting the keto oxygen atoms on the bases to the enol form, in order to make the base more highly aromatic and allowing a more ready attack of the base by the carbohydrate is advisable. Enolization is provided most conveniently by producing the silyl protecting groups. The usual silyl protecting groups, as discussed above, may be used for this purpose. The reaction between the protected carbohydrate and the base preferably is performed neat at a temperature in the range of from about 500C to about 2000C. Use of relatively high boiling solvents for the reaction, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, or hexamethylphosphoramide, however, is possible. If the coupling reaction is carried out at elevated pressures to avoid distillation of a low boiling solvent, any convenient inert reaction solvent can be used. The coupling reaction may be done at low temperatures if a reaction initiator, such as a trifluoromethanesulfonyloxysilane, is used. The usual inert reaction solvents, as discussed above, may be used at temperatures in the range of from about ambient temperature to about 1000C. The final step of the reaction sequence is the removal of the protecting groups. Most silyl protecting groups are cleaved easily by contact with water or an alcohol. The t butyldimethylsilyl protecting group requires acid conditions, such as contact with gaseous hydrogen halide, for its removal. Acyl protecting groups are removed by simple hydrolysis with strong or moderately strong bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides, at temperatures from about ambient temperature to about 1000 C. At least one equivalent amount of base is needed for each protecting group. Such hydrolyses conveniently are carried out in hydroxylic solvents, especially aqueous alkanols. The reactions also may be carried out, however, in any convenient solvent, such as polyols including ethylene glycol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone and other polar solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide.The cleavage of acyl protecting groups may also be performed with other bases including, for example, sodium methoxide, potassium t butoxide, hydrazine, hydroxylamine, ammonia, alkali metal amides and secondary amines such as diethylamine.The acyl protecting groups also can be removed with acid catalysts, such as methanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, or with acidic ion exchange resins. Carrying out such hydrolyses at a relatively high temperature, such as the reflux temperature of the mixture is preferred, but temperatures as low as ambient may be used when particularly strong acids are used. The removal of protecting groups which are ethers is carried out by known methods, for example, with ethanethiol and aluminum chloride. Compounds of the invention possessing hydroxy or amino acyl or alkyl groups can, of course, be either selectively deprotected, or such groups may be removed and selectively replaced by standard conditions. None of the reaction steps require unusual excesses of the reactants. As usual in organic syntheses, use of a moderate excess, in the range of 1.05X to 2X, is advisable. The compounds employed in this invention are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts. Such salts are to be construed as included within the scope of this invention and may include hydrobromide, hydrochloride, mono , di or triphosphate esters and sodium salts of such phosphates, sulfate, the sodium, potassium, lithium or ammonium salts, as well as others well known to those skilled in the art. Phar maceutically acceptable salts are those salts useful in the chemotheRrapy of warm blooded animals The structural drawings defining the compounds employed in the present invention do not indicate their stereochemistry. Compounds of all configurations are believed to be useful, and the stereochemistry of the compound is not to be construed as a limitation.The preferred compounds possess the configuration of naturally occurring ribose, e.g.,EMI17.1 The configuration at the juncture between the ribose and the base is preferably as follows EMI17.2 One skilled in the art would be aware of the bases which are used in the synthesis of the nucleosides employed in the present invention, but the following specific nucleosides are given to further elaborate the type of agents which may be used in this invention. 1 2,4 dioxo 1H, 3H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy2,2 difluororibose 1 4 amino 5 chloro 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluororibose 1 4 amino 5 bromo 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluororibose 1 4 amino 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2desoxy 2,2 difluororibose 1 4 amino 5 iodo 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy 2 , 2 difluororibose 1 4 amino 5 methyl 2 oxo lH pyrimidin l yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluororibose l 2 amino 6 oxo 1H,9H purin 9 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluororibose l 6 amino 9H purin 9 yl 2 desoxy 2,2 di fluororibose l 4 amino 5 fluoro 2 oxo lH pyrimidin l yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluororibose 1 4 amino 5 chloro 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluoroxylose 1 4 amino 2 oxo lH pyrimidin l yl 2 desoxy 2 , 2 difluoroxylose 1 4 amino 5 fluoro 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluoroxylose 1 4 amino 5 methyl 2 oxo 1H pyrimidin 1 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluoroxylose 1 2 amino 6 oxo 1H, 9H purin 9 yl 2desoxy 2, 2 difluoroxylose 1 6 amino 9H purin 9 yl 2 desoxy 2, 2 difluoroxylose or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

The present invention provides a method of treating susceptible neoplasms in mammals comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of formula I. The method comprises administering the compound to the mammal by various routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. The term pharmaceutically effective amount refers to an appropriate amount of a compound of formula I which is capable of providing chemotherapy to mammals. The active compounds are effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.1 to about 1200 mg kg of body weight. In the treatment of adult humans, the range of about 0.1 to about 50 mg kg, in single or divided doses, is preferred.However, it will be understood that the amount of compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the particular compound to be administered, the chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient s symptoms, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The term susceptible neoplasm , as defined herein, represents an abnormal growth of tissue in mammals capable of being treated by a compound of formula I, While the compounds of formula I are effective against tumors, both solid and non solid type, the compounds are effective in controlling the growth of rapidly dividing cells because of the compounds1 cytotoxic nature. It is a special feature of these compounds that they have a broad spectrum of activity, and are accordingly useful against a variety of tumors. The compounds of the present method are preferably administered as a pharmaceutical formulation.Therefore, as yet another embodiment of the present invention, a pharmaceutical formulation useful for treating susceptible neoplasms in mammals is provided comprising a compound of formulae II or III in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent or excipient therefor. The active ingredient will be present in the formulation in the range of about 1 to about 90 by weight. The active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi solid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols as a solid or in a liquid medium , ointments containing for example up to 10 by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders. Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyland propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures well known in the art. The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 500 mg, more usually about 25 to about 300 mg, of the active ingredient. The term unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.

The transplanted tumor was re established from the tumor bank every six months or as needed. The tumor is maintained by serial passage once a week in DBA 2 mice Charles River Wilmington, MA . X5563 Myeloma the tumor is maintained in C3H mice. The following procedure was employed in demonstrating the activity of these compounds against the tumor systems. The tumor was removed from passage animals and minced into 1 to 3 mm square fragments using sterile techniques. Tumor pieces were checked for sterility using both Antibiotic Medium 1 and Brain HeartInfusion Difco Detroit, MI . Recipient mice were shaved and tumor pieces were implanted subcutaneously in the axillary region by trocar. Drug therapy on the appropriate schedule was initiated on. the day after tumor implant. The compound was dissolved in saline for all experiments. All animals were weighed at the beginning and end of drug treatment. Food and water were provided ad libitum. On days 10 to 12, two dimensional measurements width and length of all tumors were taken using vernier calipers.Tumor weights were calculated from these measurements using the following formula Tumor Weight mg Tumor Length mm X Tumor Width mix 2 2 For all data, the tumor weight was rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram for analysis. No group is included in the analysis for therapeutic activity in which deaths attributable to drug toxicity exceeded 30 percent of the treated group. In Table 3 which follows, column 1 gives the example number of the compound tested column 2 provides the tumor system column 3, the dose level column 4, the route administered column 5, the dosage schedule column 6, the percent inhibition of the tumor and column 7, the toxic deaths observed prior to completion of the study.

The compounds are effectively administered orally, topically or parenterally. En general,.dosage rates in the range of from about 5 mg kg to about 500 mg kg are useful. It is more preferred to administer at rates in the range of from about 10 mg kg to about 100 mg kg.
