## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE HOMOGENEOUS, DUCTILE BRAZING FOILS This invention relates to brazing of metal parts and, in particular, to a homogeneous, ductile brazing material useful in brazing stainless steels and high nickel alloys. Brazing is a process for joining metal parts, often of dissimilar composition, to each other.Typically, a filler metal that has a melting point lower than that of the metal parts to be joined together is interposed between the metal parts to form an assembly.The assembly is then heated to a temperature sufficient to melt the filler metal. Upon cooling, a strong, corrosion resistant, leak tight joint is formed. As a class, stainless steel alloys are more difficult to braze than are carbon and low alloy steels.This is apparently due to the high chromium content associated with stainless steels. The formation of chromium oxide on the surfaces of stainless steels prevents wetting by the molten metal filler.Consequently, heating and brazing must be performed on carefully cleaned metal parts either in vacuum or under strongly reducing conditions, such as dry hydrogen or cracked ammonia. Alternatively, chemically active flares which dissolve the oxide must be used. However, extensive post brazing dLeaning is required to remove flux residues. In EPC Application 80100172.8 Publication No.0014337 of 20 August 1980 we have described as a filler metal for a brazed metal article, a homogeneous, ductile brazing foil composed of metastable material having at least 50 percent glassy structure and having a thickness not in excess of 0.0025 inch 6.35 x 10 3 cm , the filler metal preferably having a composition consisting essentially of 0 to 4 atom percent iron, 0 to 21 atom percent chromium, 0 to 19 atom percent boron, 0 to 12 atom percent silicon, 0 to 22 atom percent phosphorus and the balance essentially nickel and incidental impurities, the total of iron, chromium and nickel being from 76 to 84 atom percent and the total of boron, phosphorus and silicon being from 16 to 24 atom percent. The present invention provides a homogeneous, ductile brazing foil composed of metastable material having at least 50 percent glassy structure and a composition comprising as metal component s nickel and optionally one or both of iron and chromium in a total amount of 76 to 84 atom percent, as non metal or metalloid component s one or more of boron, phosphorus and silicon in a total amount of 24 to 16 atom percent, and incidental impurities characterised in that the metal component s include at least one of molybdenum, tungsten and cobalt and in that the non metal or metalloid component s can include carbon, the atom percentages of the composition being O.to 6 percent iron, 0 to 21 percent chromium, 0 to 4 percent molybdenum, 0 to 5 percent tungsten, 0 to 20 percent cobalt, 0 to 19 percent boron, 0 to 12 percent silicon, o to 22 percent phosphorus, 0 to 3 percent carbon and the balance essentially nickel and incidental impurities, the total of iron, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, cobalt and nickel being 76 to 84 atom percent and the total of boron, silicon, phosphorus and carbon being 24 to 16 atom percent. The inclusion of at least one of molybdenum, tungsten and cobalt in brazing foils of the present invention makes possible increased brazed joint strengths. The homogeneous brazing foil of the invention is fabricated by a process which comprises forming a melt of the composition and quenching the melt on a chill surface, such as a rotating quench wheel, at a rate of at least 105OC sec see U.S. Patents 3856513 and 4148973 . The filler metal composition is easily fabricable as homogeneous, ductile foil, which is useful for brazing as cast. Advantageously, the metal foil can be stamped into complex shapes to provide braze preforms. Using the homogeneous, ductile brazing foil of the invention there is no need for binders and pastes that would otherwise form voids and contaminating residues.Also, the filler material provided by the invention enables alternative brazing processes of stainless steels, e.g. dip brazing in molten salts, to be employed. As in any brazing process, the brazing material must have a melting point sufficiently high to provide strength to meet service requirements of the metal parts brazed together but not so high as to make difficult the brazing operation. Further, the filler material must be compatible, both cheirttcally and metallurgically, with the materials being brazed.The brazing material must be more noble than the metal being brazed to avoid corrosion. The brazing foil of the invention will generally be less than 0.064 mm thick, preferably 0.038 to 0.064 mm thick and most preferably 0.013 to 0.036 mm thick.The compositions of the invention are compatible with and more noble than stainless steels and are suitable for brazing austenitic, martensitic and ferritic stainless steels, as well as nickel base alloys. By homogeneous is meant that the foil, as produced, is of substantially uniform composition in all dimensions. By ductile is meant that the foil can be bent to a round radius as small as ten times the foil thickness without fracture. Examples of brazing alloy compositions within the scope of the invention are set out in Table I TABLE I Composition, Fe Ni Cr Mo W B Si Co CNi Cr Fe W B Si atom 3.2 62.9 11.8 1.7 11.8 6.4 2.1 weight 3.5 72.0 12.0 6.0 2.5 3.5 0.5Ni Cr Fe Co Mo B atom 5.0 45.0 10.0 4.0 16.0 20.0 weight 5.4 51.0 10.0 7.4 3.4 22.8 The brazing temperature of the brazing alloys of the invention ranges from 9250 to 12050C 17000 t o 22000F . The temperature of brazing is thus above the sensitizing temperature range of the 300 series stainless steels. This is in contrast to the brazing temperatures of silver brazing alloys, which fall within the sensitizing temperature range.As is well known, when 18 8 stainless steels are heated at 5100 to 7900C 9500 to 14500F for any appreciable length of time, they become sensitized or susceptible to intergranular corrosion. This is apparently due to the depletion of chromium in the grain boundary areas. Sensitizing is thus avoided by use of the brazing foils of the invention. A variety of techniques are available for fabricating continuous ribbon, wire and sheet. Typically, a particular composition is selected, powders or granules of the requisite elements in the desired portions are melted and homogenized, and the molten alloy is rapidly quenched on a chill surface, such as a rapidly rotating metal cylinder. Under these quenching conditions, a metastable, homogeneous, ductile material is obtained. The metastable material may be glassy, in which case there is no long range order. X ray diffraction patterns of glassy metal alloys show only a diffuse halo, similar to that observed for inorganic oxide glasses. Such glassy alloys must be at least 50 glassy to be sufficiently ductile to permit subsequent handling, such as stamping complex shapes from ribbons of the alloys. Preferably, the glassy metal alloys are at least 80 glassy, and most preferably substantially or totally glassy, to attain superior ductility. The metastable phase may also be a solid solution of the consituent elements. In the case of the alloys of the invention, such metastable, solid solution phases are not ordinarily produced under conventional processing techniques employed in the art of fabricating crystalline alloys. X ray diffraction patterns of the solid solution alloys show the sharp diffraction peaks characteristic of crystalline alloys, with some broadening of the peaks due to desired fine grained size of crystallites. Such metastable materials are also ductile when produced under the conditions described above. The brazing material of the invention is advantageously produced in foil or ribbon form, and may be used in brazing applications as cast, whether the material is glassy or a solid solution. Alternatively, foils of glassy metal alloys may be heat treated to obtain a crystalline phase, preferably fine grained, in order to promote longer die life when stamping of complex shapes is contemplated. Foils as produced by the processing described above typically are 0.013 to 0.064 mm thick, which is also the desired spacing between bodies being brazed.Foil thickness, and hence spacing of 0.013 to 0.036 mm maximizes the strength of the braze joint. Thinner foils stacked to form a thickness of greater than 0.064 mm may also be employed. Further, no fluxes are required during brazing, and no binders are present in the foil. Thus, formation of voids and contaminating residues is eliminated. Consequently, the ductile brazing ribbons of the invention provide both ease of brazing, by eliminating the need for spacers, and minimal post brazing treatment. In general, the strength of the resulting brazed joints is greater than that of brazed joints formed using brazing foils of otherwise similar composition but not containing at least one of molybdenum, tungsten and cobalt.
