# A METHOD OF DISPOSING OF WASTE GAS AND MEANS FOR CARRYING OUT SUCH A METHOD

## Abstract
A flare stack tip assembly serves to discharge waste gas for disposal by combustion. The assembly has an upper frusto conical tip structure 8 to which a plurality of injector devices 16 are mounted. Each of the injector devices 16 is supplied with steam which flows through a protected annular passageway 41 therein. The annular flow of steam in each device 16 induces ambient air to flow into an open inlet of the device and to mix with the surrounding steam for discharge into the waste gas passing up through the assembly prior to combustion.
