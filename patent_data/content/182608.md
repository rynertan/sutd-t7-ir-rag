Preferably the aromatic ring is unsubstituted. Suitably ArCH₂NHR¹ or a monomethyl or monoethyl ether thereof contains not more than 28 carbon atoms in total. Specific compounds within the scope of formula I include Of these specific examples of compounds of formula 1 preferred compounds include 2 methyl 2 7 methyl 7 Salts included within the scope of the present invention are those of compounds of formula 1 and ethers and esters thereof. Esters and non pharmaceutically useful salts of the compounds of the formula I are useful intermediates in the preparation and purification of compounds of the formula I and pharmaceutically useful salts thereof, and are therefore within the scope of the present invention. Thus, salts of the compounds of the formula I useful in the present invention include but are not limited to those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric and phosphoric acids, and organic acids such as isethionic 2 hydroxyethylsulfonic , maleic, malonic, succinic, salicylic, tartaric, lactic, citric, formic, lactobionic, pantothenic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, Esters of compounds of formula I are derived from acids known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for ester formation, and are conveniently those derived from C₁ ₆ alkanoic acids or alkanoic acid derivatives, for example acetic acid, propionic acid, The compounds of formula I and their ethers, esters, and salts thereof may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. Thus, the compounds of formula I may, for example, be prepared by any of the methods defined below. There is therefore provided, as a Further aspect of the invention, a method for the preparation of a compound of formula I comprising any method known for the preparation of analogous compounds, in particular those methods defined in 1 to 3 hereinabove. In a further aspect, the present invention provides novel chemical intermediates ArCH NR¹, Ar. CO. NHR¹ or ArCH₂L as herein before defined. Compounds of the formula I in which one or more of the hydoxy groups are protected, for example by benzyl, trityl or isopropylidene groups are also useful intermediates of the present invention. The compounds of this invention have biocidal activity, e.g. are toxic to certain living cells which are detrimental to mammals, for example pathogenic organisms and tumours. This toxicity to pathogenic organisms has been demonstrated for example, by activity against one or more of the following viruses e.g. Preferred compounds of the formula I are those which have antitumour activity. The activity against ascitic tumours, including P388 O, is evidenced by reduction of tumour cell number in mammals for example, mice bearing ascitic tumours and their consequent increase in survival duration as compared to an untreated tumour bearing control group. Antitumour activity is further evidenced by measurable reduction in the size of solid tumours following treatment of mammals with the compounds of this invention compared to the tumours of untreated control tumour bearing animals. Compounds of formula I are active against murine tumours such as lymphocytic leukaemia P388 0, lymphocytic leukaemia L1210, melanotic melanoma B16, P815 mastocytoma, MDAY D2 fibrosarcoma, colon 38 adenocarcinoma, M5076 rhabdomyosarcoma and Lewis lung carcinoma. Activity in one or more of these tumour tests has been reported to be indicative of antitumour activity in man A. Goldin There are sublines of P388 0 which have been made resistant to the following clinically useful agents cytosine arabinoside, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, Compounds of formula I have also been found to be active against human tumour cells in primary cultures of lung, ovary, breast, renal, melanoma, unknown primary, gastric, pancreatic, mesothelioma, myeloma, and or colon cancer. As used herein cancer is to be taken as synonymous with malignant tumour or more generally tumour unless otherwise noted. This is a procedure in which the prevention of tumour cell colony formation, i.e. tumour cell replication, by a drug has been shown to correlate with clinical antitumour activity in man D.D. Von Hoff Compounds of formula I which have been found to have antitumour activity intercalate As has been described above, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of tumours. The invention thus further provides a method for the treatment of tumours in animals, including mammals, especially humans, which comprises the administration of a clinically useful amount of compound of formula I in a pharmaceutically useful form, once or several times a day or other appropriate schedule, orally, rectally, parenterally, or applied topically. In addition, there is provided as a further, or alternative, aspect of the invention, a compound of formula I for use in therapy, for example as an antitumour agent. The amount of compound of formula I required to be effective as a biocidal agent will, of course, vary and is ultimately at the discretion of the medical or veterinary practitioner. The factors to be considered include the condition being treated, the route of administration, and nature of the formulation, the mammal s body weight, surface area, age and general condition, and the particular compound to be administered. A suitable effective antitumour dose is in the range of about 0.1 to about 120 mg kg body weight, preferably in the range of about 1.5 to 50 mg kg, for example 10 to 30 mg kg. The total daily dose may be given as a single dose, multiple doses, Whilst it is possible for the active compound defined herein as compound of formula I , or ether, ester, or salt thereof to be administered alone, it is preferable to present the active compound in a pharmaceutical formulation. Formulations of the present invention, for medical use, comprise an active compound together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally other therapeutical ingredients. The carrier s must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The present invention, therefore, further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I in the form of the free base, ether, or ester derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. There is also provided a method for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising bringing into association a compound of formula I an ether, ester, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. Whilst the antitumour activity of the compounds of Formula I is believed to reside in the free base, it is often convenient to administer an acid addition salt of a compound of formula I . The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration. Preferred formulations are those suitable for oral or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active compound into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into assocation with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into desired formulations. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound as a powder or granules or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non aqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion or a draught. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered active compound with any suitable carrier. A syrup may be made by adding the active compound to a concentrated, aqueous solution of a sugar, for example sucrose, to which may also be added any accessory ingredients. Such accessory ingredient s may include flavourings, an agent to retard crystallization of the sugar or an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, such as a polyhydric alcohol for example glycerol or sorbitol. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a conventional carrier such as cocoa butter. Formulations suitable For parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active compound which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulations suitably comprise a solution of a pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt of a compound of the Formula I that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Thus, such formulations may conveniently contain distilled water, 5 dextrose in distilled water or saline and a pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt of a compound of the formula I that has an appropriate solubility in these solvents, For example the hydrochloride, isethionate and methanesulfonate salts, preferably the latter. Useful formulations also comprise concentrated solutions or solids containing the compound of formula I which upon dilution with an appropriate solvent give a solution suitable for parenteral administration as above. In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may Further include one or more accessory ingredient s selected from diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including antioxidants and the like. The following examples are provided by the way of illustration of the present invention and should in no way be construed as a limitation thereof. All solvents were reagent grade and used without further purification with the following exceptions.
