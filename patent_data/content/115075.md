# Magnetic recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus with a U type Î² system tape loading system, a rotary head cylinder 1 is inclined toward a point where is located on the peripheral surface of the cylinder through an angular distance of 139 to 229 in a direction of the running of a magnetic recording tape 15 on the peripheral surface of the cylinder from a point where the tape 15 is separated from the cylinder, and a tilt subpost 45 is disposed downstream of the cylinder along a tape travel direction and is brought into contact with the tape fed from the cylinder to align a longitudinal edge of the tape to be substantially parallel with a base plate 17 .
