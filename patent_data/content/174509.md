## Description
A Dispersing Agent for a Coal Water Slurry This invention reiates to a dispersing agent for a coal water slurry comprising a polyelectrolyte made from a modified olefin maleic anhydride copolymer. By using the poly electrolyte to make the coal water slurry, it is possible to easily obtain a coal water slurry which is highly fluid even at high coal concentrations and remains even when allowed to stand for a long period. The term even means that the concentration of the slurry is uniform. Non uniformity, by contrast, would result in the sedimentation of the coal in the slurry. Recently, efforts have been made to reduce dependency on petroleum as energy source, given the uncertainty of its supply. It has become an objective to develop an energy source other than petroleum which can be supplied more re liable and constantly. Because of its large, worldwide un derground reserves, coal has been studied as one such energy scurce and many methods to use coal are under in vestigation. However, compared with petroleum, coal is very disadvantageous as regards handling, e.g. transportation or storage, given its solid state. Therefore, possibilities have been examined to make coal easier te handle, as for instance in the form of a fluid, obtained by pulverizing coal and dispersing the coal powder in water, methanol or oil. However, a coal oil slurry or coal methanol slurry are not completely independent of petroleum. Consequently, a mixture comprising water and the coal powder dispersed in the water, that is a coal water slurry, has been considered.The coal water slurry has advantages as regards transportation, storage and combustion, as combustion can be controlled better, transportation by pipeline is easier and storage is more convenient. For with a slurry it is not necessary to devise a method to prevent it from spontaneous ignition or from scattering as is the case with a powder.However, since the slurry contains water, its calorific value as a fuel is necessarily lower and transportation costs are inevitably higher. Therefore, the concentration of the coal in the slurry should be as high as possible.On the other hand, if the concentration of the slurry is increased, the viscosity of the slurry increases as well, and as a result its fluidity is lowered or lost. To solve these problems, i.e. to disperse the coal in water in such a way that the resulting a coal water slurry is highly fluid, a dispersing agent, such as formaldehyde, aromatic sulphonic acid condensates, salts of lignin sulphonic acid, polyoxyethylenealkylphenyl ethers, salts of polyacrylic acid, salts of a copolymer made from acrylic acid and vinyl monomers, has been used.However, the coal water slurry obtained using the above dispersing agents is not fluid enough at high concentrations, e.g. at a concentration of 70 by weight, nor does it remain even when it is allowed to stand for a long period of time. Summary of the InventionIt is the object of the present invention to provide a dispersing agent facilitating the preparation of a coal water slurry which is highly fluid at high coal concentrations but does not turn uneven when allowed to stand for a long period.It is another object of the present invention to provide a coal water slurry which is highly fluid at high coal concentrations but does not turn uneven when allowed to stand for a long period. According to the present invention, the above objects are achieved by using a dispersing agent comprising, as an effective component, a polvelectrolyte made by reacting an alkali metal compound, an alkali earth metal compound, ammonia or an aminewith a modified alpha olefin maleic anhydride copolymer comprising a structural unit I based on the 2 olefin, a structural unit II based on maleic anhydride and a modified structural unit selected from a group consisting of A a terminal group III of the general formula RÚS wherein RÚ represents a hydrocarbon residue having 4 to 30 carbon atoms, and B a structural unit IV o of the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R represents hydrocarbon residue having 4 to 30 carbon atoms and n is zero cr 1, the molar ratio of unit fIV to unit II ranging from 0.005 to 0.2, said copolymer containing units I and fli in such an amount that the molar ratio of unit I to unit II is in the range of from 0.8 to 3.0 and having a weight average molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 20,000. The above polyelectrolyte is obtained by reacting an alkali metal compound, an alkali earth metal compound, ammonia or an amine with a modified alpha olefin maleic anhydride copolymer which is obtained by copolymerizing an alpha olefin and maleic anhydride in solution and in the presence of a modifier selected from the croup consisting of a thiol of the general formula RÚSH IIIa , wherein RÚ represents a hydrocarbon residue having 4 to 30 carbon atoms1 and an unsaturated acid ester of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon reside having 4 to 30 carbon atoms, and n is zero or 1. Usually, O olefin maleic anhydride copolymers are almost alternating copolymerscomprising a structural unit I based on theSolefin and a structural unit II based on the naleic anhydride, that is a structural unit I II . Also the modified A olefin maleic anhydride copolymer used in the invention, is almost an alternating copolymer. For example, when the thiol is used as a modifier in the copolymerization, in many cases, an alternatingr olefin maleic anhydride copolymer having a group of the general formula R1S III as a terminal group is obtained.In many cases, when the unsaturated acid ester is used as a modifier, an d olefin maleic anhydride copolymer 5 obtained wherein a small part of the main chain comprising the structural unit I II is substituted for the unit of the general formulaEMI4.2 Preferablv, the above polyelectrolyte is soluble in water. However, it may be hydrophilic not soluble in pure water, but in water containing a basic compound as long as it dissolves in the slurry. alpha olefins suitable for use in manufacturing the above modified alpha olefin maleic anhydride copolymer include straight or branched u olefins having 2 to 12 carbon atoms preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Specific examples of suitable alpha olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene l, butene 2, isobutylene, isoprene, pentene l, pentene 2, 2 methyl 1 butene, 2 methyl 2 butene, hexene 1, 2 methyl 1 pentene, 3 methyl 1 pentene, 4 methyl1 pentene, 2 ethyl 1 butene, butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene, 1,4hexadiene, 2,3 dimethyl 2 butene and diisobutylen. alpha olefins having 4 carbon atoms and the mixture thereof such as return B.B a steam cracked mixture of butenes from the butadien plant raffinate are preferred. Isobutylene is most preferred. These alpha olefins can be used singly or in the form of a mixture of two or more of them. It is preferable to use pure maleic anhydride. However, a small part of maleic anhydride may be substituted for its derivatives such as maleic acid, maleic acid mono or dialkyl ester, citraconic acid and chloride derivatives thereof, On the other hand, the modifier used in the copolymerization may be a thiol of the general formula R1SH IIIa wherein R1 represents a hydrocarbon residue having 4 to 30 carbon atoms, or an unsaturated acid ester of the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein R2 represents a hydrocarbon residue having 4 to 30 carbon atoms, and n is zero or 1. in the above formula, R1 or R2 is preferably a hydrocarbon residue having S to 28 carbon atoms, more preferably 10 to 25 carbon atoms. Specific examples of the hydrocarbon residues include a straight alkyl group such as n octyl, n nonyl, n dodecyl, n hexadecyl, n octadecyl, n eicosyl or n docosyl, a branched alkyl group such as 2 ethylhexyl or t dodecyl, an alicyclic alkyl group such as cyclohexyl or cyclooctyl and an aryl group such as phenyl, tolyl or naphthyl.

Unsaturated acid esters useful as modifiers include n octylmethacrylate, n dodecylmethacrylate, t dodecylmeth acrylate, n hexadecylmethacrylate, n docosylmethacrylate and 2 ethylhexylacrylate. The molar ratio of the structural unit ti to the structural unit II in the modified alpha olefin maleic anhydride copolymer preferably ranges from 0.8 to 3.0, more preferably 0.8 to 1.2.Most preferably, the ratio is about l, as mentioned above. When the thiol is used as modifier, the copolymer comprises the structure unit I and II in the main chain and te group III as terminal group. On the other hand, when te unsaturated acid ester is used, the copolymer comprises the structural units I , II and tIV in the main chain. Preferably the molar ratio of the structural unit IV to the structural unit II ranges from 0.005 to 0.2, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1. The weight average molecular weight of the modified copolymer ranges from 1,000 to 20,000, preferably from 5,000 tc 15,000. If the molecular weight is beyond these ranges, it is difficult to disperse the coal in the water even if the polyelectrolyte is used.As mentìonedaDove, thetra ofied i olefin maleic anhydride copolymer is obtained by copolymerizing the olefin and maleic anhydride in solution and in the presence of the modifier. The alpha olefin and the maleic acid are fed into the copolymerizatlon mixture in a molar ratio of from 0.8 to 3.0, preferably of 0.8 to 1.2. Most preferably the ratio is about 1.In the copolymerization, conventional radical initiators are preferably used. Examples of suitable initiators include azo compounds such as azo bis isobutyl nitrile or azo bis lcyclohexane l carbonitrile, and peroxides such as cumene hydroperoxide, dicumyl hydroperoxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide and lauroyl peroxide. examples of the solvent used in the copolymerlzaton include ketones such as acetone or methylethylketone, esters such as methylacetate, ethylacetate or methylpropionate, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, aromatic hydrocarbons having 8 to 12 carbon atoms such as benzene, xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n butylbenzene, t butylbenzene isopropylbenzene or p cymene. The aromatic hydrocarbons are most preferred among the solvent. Ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene or p cymene are especially advantageous in respect of copolymer yield and easier control of the molecular weight of the copolymer.The amount of the thiol used as modifier in the copolymeriation preferably range. from O. to 30 moles per one mole of maleic rnhydrido, and thsa nount of the unsaturated acid ester preferably ranges from 0.005 to 0.2 moles par une mole of maleic anhydride. The solvent, monomex, initiator and modifier may be added at the initial stage of the copolymerization successively during the copolymerization. The copolymerization temperature ranges from 0 to 6Oco. When alkylbenzene is used as solvent, it may range from 60 to 130 C, more preferably from 80 to 1200C. In the invention, the modified olelin maleic anhydride copolymer is used in the form of a polyelectrolyte obtained by reaction with a basic compound an alkali metal compound such as its hydroxide, its carbonate or its salt of anorganic acid, an alkali earth metal compound such as its hydroxide, its carbonate or its salt of organic acid, ammonia or an amine.The basic compounds suitable for use include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, potassium acetate, sodium acetate and ammonia. The modified alpha olefin maleic anhydride copolymer is reacted with the basic compound in the solvent water is most preferred ar room temperature or an elevated temperature under normal pressure, The amount of the basic coppound varies with the type of basic compound or the reaction conditions used. Generally, the amount is such that the molar ratio of the basic compound to the maleic anhydride residue of the copoly mer ranges from 0.6 to 2. The polyelectrolyte obtained in the reaction has a degree of neutralization of 0.3 to 1.0 with respect to all carboxyl groups based on the maleic anhydride residue of the copolymer. If the degree of neutralization is lower, no dispersing effect of the polyelectrolyte is observed in the slurry.The smaller the particle size of the coal powder in the slurry, the better is its dispersion. Therefore, a particle size of the powder should preferably be small. However, pulverization of the coal involves expenses and the fine powder used in a steampower plant usually has such a size so that 80 percent of the powder pass through a sieve of 200 mesh about 74 microns . Therefore this particle size is sufficient for the coal water slurry. The dispersing agent of the invention is used in the same manner as the dispersing agent known before. For example, if the coal is pulverized in the dry state, the dispersing agent is added to the water and the dry coal powder is added to the aqueous solution containing the dispersing agent to form a slurry. On the other hand, when the coal is pulver ized in wet state, the dispersing agent is added to the water to be used for pulverizing the coal before pulverization is started or is placed into the pulverizer during pulverization or is added to the mixture of water and pulverized coal after pulverization. The amount of the dispersing agent used in the invention varies with the type of coal, the particle size of the powder of the coal or the like. Usually, if the dispersing agent is used in the range of fram 0.01 to 5.0 by weight, preferably of from 0.05 to 2.0 by weight based on the coal, the dispersing effect is high enough. Generally, the upper limit of the ccncentration of the coal in the slurry that shows fluidity is 50 by weight if no dispersing agent is used. However, if the dispersing agent of the invention is used, the slurry obtained shows fluidity and is transportable by pipelines even at a concentration of 70 by weight or most preferably 72 B by weight , because the dispersing agent of the invention lowers the viscosity of the slurry and the slurry shows stability when it is allowed to stand for a long period. The dispersing agent can be used together with a surface activator or a protective colloid such as polyoxyethylenealkyl phenyl ether, salt ot polyacrylic acid, salt of polyphosphine, carboxymethyl cellulose or polyvinyl alcohol. The invention will now be described in more detail in the foilowing examples.Example 1 437 g of ethylbenzene solvent was placed into an autoclave content 1000ml having an agitator and the atomosphere was replace by N. 28. g of isobutylene was added,The temperature in the autoclave was maintained at 90 C. k solution containing 100 g of ethylbenzene, 45 g of maleic anhydride molar ratio to isobutylene 1 1.1 , 2.22 c of benzoyl peroxide initiator and 10.35 g of n butylmercaptan modifier was fed into the above autoclave successively during 1 hours ana a copolymerization reaction was carried out.After copolymerization, the precipitated particlesweretaken out and dried.

The results are shown in Table 3.For comparison, an alternating isobutene maleic anhydride copolymer and its esterified copolymer were prepared, in which half the carboxyl groups based on maleic anhydride were esterified by n octyl alcohol. These copolymers were dissolved in water to form salts of these copolymers in the same way as above.The slurry obtained did not have a viscosity lower than any one of the above Examples using the above salts.

The results are shown inTable 6.As can be seen from the above, when the commercial dispersing agent is used, the coal water slurry obtained has a very high viscosity at a concentration of 70 by weight. However, the slurry poses problems as to fluidity. By contrast, when the dispersing agent of the present invention is used, the slurry obtained has a viscosity lower than 3,000 centipoise cp .Therefore, the slurry is easier to transport and to handle and combustion is controlled more easily.Furthermore, the slurry remains even when it is allowed to stand for a long period.
