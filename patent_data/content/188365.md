# Control method for a recording device.

## Abstract
A method of recording, in an electronic memory device, the pressure and temperature detected during a plurality of events occurring in a well, the method comprising defining a plurality of first time periods, each representing a first period of time during which one of the events might occur defining a plurality of second time periods, each represent ing a second period of time during which one of the events might occur assigning a sample rate to each of said first and second time periods corresponding to the same one of the events so that a plurality of sample rates is defined in correspondence with said plurality of events, each of said sample rates defining the frequency at which at least one of said pressure and temperature is desired to be recorded during the respective time period deriving from said plurality of first and second time periods, and said plurality of sample rates, a single set of time intervals having a respective sample rate associated with each one of said time intervals entering said single set of time intervals and each respective sample rate in said electronic memory device activating said electronic memory device lowering said electronic memory device into said well and recording in said electronic memory device at least one of said pressure and temperature in response to the respective sample rate with each of said time intervals.
