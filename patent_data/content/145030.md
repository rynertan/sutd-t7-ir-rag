# METHOD OF FORMING AN OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE FIBER

## Abstract
A method is disclosed comprising the steps of deposit ing on a rotating starting member 131 a first coating 130 of particulate glass, depositing on the outer surface of said first coating 130 another coating 134, 135, 136 of particulate glass, removing said starting member 131 , and forming an optical waveguide fiber from the resultant soot preform. The step of depositing another coating comprises depositing a second coating 134 of particulate glass on the outer surface of said first coating 130 , the refractive index of said second coating 134 being lower than that of said first coating 130 , depositing on diametrically opposed portions of said second coating 134 first and second longitudinally extending regions 135 of glass soot having a thermal coefficient of expansion different from that of the said second coating 134 , and depositing on the outer surface of the resultant soot body a coating of cladding soot 137 having a thermal coefficient of expansion similar to that of said second coating 134 and having a refractive index equal to or lower than that of said second coating 134 .
