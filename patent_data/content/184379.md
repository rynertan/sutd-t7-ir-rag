# Vinyl chloride polymer resin composition.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a vinyl chloride polymer composition comprising i 100 parts by weight of a vinyl chloride polymer containing at least 80 wt. of vinyl chloride units, and ii 0.05 to 25 wt. parts of a three stage polymer II , which is obtained by polymerizing 10 to 30 wt. parts of at least one monomer B , which is selected from acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters, aromatic vinyl compounds, cyano vinyl compounds and vinyl ester compounds so that the glass transition temperature of a polymer obtained by separately polymerizing the monomer B is 0 to 60 C, in the presence of 45 to 85 wt. parts of a methyl methacrylate polymer A containing at least 80 wt. of methyl methacry late units and then polymerizing 5 to 25 wt. parts of a methyl methacrylate monomer or monomer mixture C containing at least 80 wt. of methyl methacrylate in the presence of the obtained copolymer comprising the components A and B so that the total amount of the components A , B , and C is 100 wt. parts. The vinyl chloride polymer composition is advantageous in that the gelation speed is high, the parting property at the calendering step is good, adhesion to the vessel wall is not caused at the blending step before the processing, the processability is excellent, and the composi tion gives a molded articles having a good transparency and a good surface condition.
