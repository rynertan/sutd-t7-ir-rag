# ELECTRONIC STARTER CIRCUIT FOR DISCHARGE LAMPS

## Abstract
Starter circuits are disclosed for a fluorescent discharge tube 10 of the type having a pair of heater cathodes between which the discharge is struck and which are connectable to the mains supply V₅ through a ballast inductor L . The starter circuit 20 includes a thyristor SCR that conducts current through the ballast inductor and heaters on half cycles on one polarity. A gate control circuit 30 includes a capacitor C₁ that receives a controlled by C₂, Z₁ bias voltage increment in each such half cycle to eventually terminate triggering of the thyristor SCR . Prefer ably an automatic switching arrangement C₃, Z₂ changes the value of capacitance to give a lesser rate of increment upon a certain bias level being reached to provide a two phase start operation that eventually times out. Alternatively, the maximum bias may be clamped and a positive tempera ture coefficient resistor PTC carrying the heater current terminates the second phase upon heating to a predeter mined resistance. The starter circuit 20 also includes a non linear dielectric element NLDE that cooperates with the inductor to generate striking voltage for the tube and that is connected in an ignition circuit including a capacitor C₅ connected to the thyristor SCR to charge and maintain the NLDE quiescent during normal operation but to be dis charged by the thyristor SCR during starting to allow the NLDE to achieve saturation and coact with the ballast inductor L .
