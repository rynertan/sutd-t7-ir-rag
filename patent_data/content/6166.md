# Print mechanism for use in printing apparatus and printing apparatus including such mechanisms.

## Abstract
A mechanism for a matrix printer has a robust single turn closed loop transformer secondary winding 3 as the moving part for driving a print stylus 9 into and out of a print position. Each secondary winding 3 threads a transformer core 1 on which is wound a multiturn pri mary winding 2 . A stack of such secondary windings 3 , arranged with print styli 9 in a closely spaced print row across the stack are supported in a static magnetic field produced by a magnetic assembly 10 . Energisation of a primary winding 2 induces a large current flow in its se condary winding 3 which reacts with the field to drive the associated print stylus 9 into the print position. In one embodiment, the stack of secondary windings 3 are all mounted on a single pivot 6 and each swings about the pivot 6 as a whole upon energisation of its associated primary winding 2 . In another embodiment each secondary loop of the stack is formed so as to be elastically deform able whereby a portion of the loop carrying the stylus is deflected into the print position upon energisation of its associated primary winding.
