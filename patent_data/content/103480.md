# Cutterblock blade anchorage.

## Abstract
In a rotary cutterblock 1 of a woodworking machine, cutter blades 5 are retained by wedge members 7 located in inwardly divergent recesses 2 of the cutterblock. Each wedge member 7 substantially fills its recess 2 to reduce the noise of the cutterblock in operation, and has a clamping screw 8 recessed therein and accessible only through a chordal passage 12 in the cutterblock 1. Tightening of each screw 8 so that its head 9 is compressed against a face 6 of the cutterblock 1 only in an annular zone around the passage 12 is surprisingly effective to maintain a very firm and effective clamping pressure of the wedge members 7 on the blades 5.

## Description
TITI,E Cutterblock Blade AnchorageDESCRIPTION The invention relates to rotary cutterblocks for woodworking machines, and in particular to the anchorage of the blades in such cutterblocks.Conventional rotary cutterblocks comprise a cylindrical cutterblock body having a number of inwardly divergent recesses in the cylindrical outer surface of the body, and a cutter blade retained in each of the recesses by a wedge member and one or more clamping screws.In one form of cutterblock the clamping screws are dog point grub screws screw threadedly engaging a chordal threaded bore in the cutterblock to bear against a front face of the wedge member so that the cutter blade is clamped between the rear face of the wedge member and a rear face of the recess in the cutterblock body. One major disadvantage in the use of such dog point screws is that they tend to fracture in the cutterblock body due to the redu,ced amount of material around the hexagonal shaped hole or screwdriver slot used for turning the screws. These screws, when they fail, are a major problem to extract from the cutterblock.In another form of cutterblock the clamping screws are hexagonal headed screws screw threadedly engaging the wedge member, with the hexagonal head of each screw projecting from the wedge member into the recess in the cutterblock body. Such screws are accessed and turned by means of a spanner inserted radially into the recess in the cutterblock body, between the front face of that recess and the wedge One major disadvantage in such a design is that it imparts a necessary clearance between the front face of the recess and the wedge, wlacn clearance generates substantial amounts of noise in use, particularly in high speed use, and interferes with good chip flow from the blade in use.The disadvantages of both of the above designs are overcome by the invention which provides a rotary cutterblock for a woodworking machine, comprising a cylindrical cutterblock body having a number of inwardl divergent recesses in he cylindrical outer surface thereof and a cutter blade retained in each of the recesses by a wedge member and one or more clamping screws screw threaded in the wedge member, characterised in that each wedge member substantially fills its recess and has its clamping screw or screws recessed therein so that a head of the or each screw lies close to the plane of the front face of the wedge member, and the cutterblock body is provided with a chordal passage for each clamping screw, aligned with the axis of the respective clamping screw for insertion of a key member to tighten or loosen the screw.Because the wedge member of the cutterblock of the invention substantially fills its recess, it may be made of a suitable profile to achieve optimum chip flow. Also such filling of the recess reduces the noise of the cutterblock in operation.The clamping screws of the cutterblock of the invention are headed screws unlike the grub screws of the prior art so that the additional material around the screwdriver slot or hexagonal shaped hole at the head of the screws provides a very considerable strengthening in an area of proved weakness. It is surprising that the cutter blocks of the invention are reliable in practice, as the chordal access passages for the clamping screws in effect remove a substantial part of the material of the cutterblock body in precisely the zone where there would otherwise have been engagement between the head of the clamping screw and the cutterblock body.This leaves the engagement of those to parts as being simply in an annular zone around the mouth of the chordal access passage, which surprisingly y has been found more than adequate to provide a very safe and reliable blade anchorage.DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic cross section through a rotary cutter block of the invention, with only one blade and blade mounting wedge being shown Figure 2 is a corresponding section through a part of one form of prior art cutterblock Figure 3 is a corresponding section through a part of another form of prior art cutterblock and Figure 4 is a corresponding section through anothe rotary cutter block of the invention. Referring first to Figure 1, the cutterblock comprises a cylindrical cutterblock body 1 having two diametrically opposed inwardly divergent recesses 2 formed therein. In the upper of the two recesses 2 as illustrated there is shown in detail a blade and blade mounting.The blade 3 is shown as having a serrated back face 4, engaging mating serrations in the cutterblock bodyBetween the front face 5 of the blade 3 and the front face 6 of the recess 2 there is provided a wedge 7 and a clamping screw 8. The threaded shaft of the clamping screw 8 screw threadedly engages a bore in the wedge 7, and a head 9 of the screw is received in a cutaway portion 10 of the wedge 7. In the head 9 of the screw 8 is formed a hexongal key recess 11, enabling the screw to be turned hy anAllen key not shown . To enable the key to be inserted in the recess 11, there is provided a chordal passage 12 extending through the body 1 in alignment with the axis of the screw 8.In use, the screws 8 are screwed fully into the wedges 7, and the wedges inserted into the recesses 2 in the axial direction. Allen keys are then inserted through the passages 12 and used to withdraw successive screws 8 partially from the threaded bores in the wedges 7, until the outer annular portion of the head 9 of each screw 8 engages that portion of the front face 6 of the recess 2 immediately surrounding the passage 12. In this way the blade can be securely anchored in the cutterblock.Figure 2 shows how, in a prior design, the head 9 of each clamping screw 8 was a hexongal head that was accessed radially through a gap between the wedge 7 and the body 1 of the cutterblock. The spacing d between the wedge and the body did, however, produce undesirable noise during operation and interfered with good chip flow. Figure 3 shows an alternative prior art construction, in which the wedge 7 was retained by a dog point grub screw 8 screw threaded into the body 1 of the cutterblock. The relative lack of material around the hexagonal recess 11 in the grub screw 8 resulted in frequent failure of such anchorages, such failures being avoided in the cutterblock of the invention. Figure 4 shows another embodiment of the invention which is similar to that of Figure 1 except that the screw 8 has a head 9 which is shaped at 13 to extend partially into the chordal passage 12. This provides a more positive anchorage of the wedge 7, which may be desirable for some applications.
