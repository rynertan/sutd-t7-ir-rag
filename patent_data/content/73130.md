# Method for manufacturing a mask type Read Only Memory.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a mask type read only memory having a plurality of MOS transistors is described, in which source and drain regions of certain of the M0S transistors are shorted in accordance with a requested program, after an interconnection wiring layer has been formed on the semiconductor substrate. The source and drain regions are interconnected by means of a channel 83 created by ion implantation of a suitable impurity. The shorted MOS transistors are then covered by a protective layer 84 , the contour of which indicates those MOS transistors which have been shorted.
