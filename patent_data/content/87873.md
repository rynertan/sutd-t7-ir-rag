# Variable ratio power transmission means.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a continuously variable ratio power transmission means comprising truncated cones 20,22,22 ,24 having concave parabolic circumferential sur faces which surfaces are in rolling contact one with another and which can be moved in a linear fashion to provide a variable ratio dependent on point an extent of overlap and rolling contact. In a preferred form of the invention positive drive is provided by a rack or band of gear teeth 30, 31, 32, 33 being provided in a helix around the periphery of each cone 20,22,22 ,24 in a constant helix or lead angle.
