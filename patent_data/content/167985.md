# AUTOMATIC WIRING STATION PARTICULARLY FOR MACHINES FOR PREPARING CUT TO SIZE ELECTRICAL WIRE LEADS FITTED WITH INSULATABLE ELECTRICAL TERMINALS

## Abstract
The automatic wiring station comprises a movable grip per 9 adapted to grip a first end of a wire lead as previously fitted with an electrical connector 20 and a pusher assembly 28 including a clamp 34 37 for clamping on the wire lead end fitted with a terminal 20 to guide it through a translatory movement toward a seat accommodating an insulating pro tection and subsequently toward a base 4 to be wired. The station also comprises an insulating protection feeder ar ranged to progressively move a protection into the path of attachment of the electrical terminal 20 , a holder 50, 51 for clamping the base 4 with several connections 53, 54 to be wired, a switch over device for pre selecting the cross sectional area of the electrical wire lead 23, 64, 65 combined with a station 70 72 for overprinting the ends of each wire lead length with a code, and a means of controlling and setting the operations of the machine while running.
