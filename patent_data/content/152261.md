# Roller skate with integral ratchet means.

## Abstract
A roller skate includes a selectively engagable ratcheting plate that can be positioned for engaging a plurality of teeth formed integrally in one or more wheels of the skate. The plate rides on a cam that is slidably positioned for selective racheting or freewheeling operation. In the ratcheting mode the skate is prevented from rolling backwards thereby making it easier for a beginning skater to use.
