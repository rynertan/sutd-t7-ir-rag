# ANNULAR CORRUGATOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing annular corrugations in the wall of thin metal tubing in the manufacture of corru gated metal hose includes a plurality of annular dies 30 40 . Each die comprises a helical rib 30 40 of greater than 360 extent formed on the inner surface of the die with the ribs on successive dies being pro gressively thinner and having successively closer pitches so as to progressively deepen the corrugations 11a 11f and make them narrower. The dies 30 40 are mounted to rotate in synchronization with each other at identical angular speeds, and are arrarged in pairs in one or more stages with the dies in each stage engaging opposite sides of the tube 11 . A non rotatable guide 28 projects inside the first die 30 and has an aper ture 126 to permit the rib 30 of the first die 30 to contact the tube 11 at one location of the tube circumference while the remainder of the tube is rigidly supported against collapse by the guide 28 . Transfer of the corrugations from one die to the next is assisted by providing the intermediate dies with lead in portions 130 136 having the same pitch as the rib in the preced ing die.
