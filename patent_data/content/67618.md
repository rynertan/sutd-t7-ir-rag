# WHOLLY AROMATIC POLYESTER CAPABLE OF FORMING AN ANISOTROPIC MELT PHASE AT AN ADVANTAGEOUSLY REDUCED TEMPERATURE

## Abstract
An improved wholly aromatic polyester is provided which exhibits an anisotropic melt phase and which is capable of readily undergoing melt processing. The wholly aromatic polyester consists essentially of the recurring units a p oxybenzoyl moiety, b 2,6 dioxynaphthalene moiety, c 2,6 dioxyanthraquinone moiety and d terephthaloyl moiety in the concentrations indicated. The resulting polym er is substantially free of aromatic rings possessing ring substitution and meta disposed linkages in the polymer chain. The present invention represents an improvement over the polyester of U.S. Patent No. 4,184,996 since the melt phase may be formed at an advantageously reduced temper ature, thereby better facilitating the use of standard melt processing equipment when forming fibres, films, three dimensional shaped articles, etc. The reduction in possible melt processing temperature is accomplished without any significant diminution in melt anisotropy such as that which would result if non symmetrical meta disposed linkages were present in the polymer chain. Also, the present polyester does not rely upon the presence of ring substitu tion as a means for producing the desired melt anisotropy.
