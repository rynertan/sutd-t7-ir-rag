# POWER SOURCE FOR ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE MACHINING.

## Abstract
A power source for electrical discharge machining has a switching element Q₁ inserted into a circuit which dis charges a capacitor Co . The discharge voltage of the capacitor Co is detected from a terminal a and when the discharge voltage exceeds a reference voltage, charging of the capacitor Co is halted, and the switching element Q₁ is turned on. The discharge current of the capacitor Co is detected by a detector 5 , and when discharge is suspended, the switching element Q₁ is turned off so as to stabilize the discharge as well as prevent damage to the switching element Q₁ . When a predetermined period of time has elapsed thereafter, the charging of the capacitor Co is resumed.
