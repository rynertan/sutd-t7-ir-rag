## Description
Malaria parasites Malaria presents a very considerable medical problem, despite the development of various drugs for its treatment. This is particularly the case since, of the four species of It is a commonly held view expressed in a recent authoritative review Cox, Nature, 1983, We have now been able to show that this commonly held view is incorrect and that the sporozoite surface and the intra erythrocytic stages of the parasite do possess antigens which will react with a common antibody, this finding being of particular importance since it means that antigenic materials can be prepared which will generate antibodies reactive against two markedly different stages of the parasite s life cycle. Such antigenic materials may advantageously be based upon antigens present in the intra erythrocytic stages of the parasite thereby providing a high level of efficacy in vaccination against intra erythrocytic forms of the parasite, whilst at the same time inducing antibodies active against the sporozoite surface. Accordingly the present invention comprises an antigenic material suitable for use in vaccination against malaria which a is an antigenic substance characterised by It will be appreciated that although antigenic materials according to the present invention are characterised by this one particular form of epitope they may however also contain other epitopes in addition. The epitope occurring in nature in association with intra erythrocytic forms of the parasite is shared with the surface of sporozoites since both the surface of the sporozoites and the intra erythrocytic stages of the parasite carry an antigen containing an epitope which is reactive with a common antibody site, or paratope. Howver, this does not necessarily mean that the epitope, in terms of the sequence of amino acid residues by which it is constituted, will be present in identical form on the sporozoite surface and in association with intra erythrocytic forms of the parasite, but rather that the particular amino acid residues which are present in the epitope will in each case have a specific reactivity for the common antibody site. The intra erythrocytic stage epitope and the sporozoite epitope will thus share the same activity, even though they may not be completely identical. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the amino acid residues constituting the epitope may be in consecutive or non consecutive sequence. Whilst the detailed structure of the epitope may vary between different strains of It will be appreciated, however, that the present invention is not limited to such antigens as occur in nature, whether isolated therefrom or synthetically produced, but also extends to artificially produced materials of a molecular weight in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 daltons containing an epitope which occurs in one of the natural antigens of As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, more effective control of malaria produced by the species It will be seen, however, that the characterisation of the antibodies produced by the 5.1 hybridoma which is presented in these two papers fails to make any reference to their ability to react not only with an intra erythrocytic stage antigen but also with sporozoites. Moreover the SDS PAGE analysis of the ¹²⁵I labelled proteins with which the 5.1 hybridoma antibodies react presented in the Hall The present invention derives from the hitherto quite unexpected finding that monoclonal antibodies could be raised which are reactive not only with an epitope present in an intra erythrocytic stage antigen of The procedure used to produce the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, and which may be utilised to produce alternative hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies reactive with the 5.1 1 epitope, involved the fusion between spleen cells from a Balb c mouse immunized with Once one hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibodies specific for the epitope 5.1 1 has been prepared it may, if desired, be utilised in preparing alternative hybridomas of similar epitopic specificity. Monoclonal antibody specific for the 5.1 1 epitope produced by such alternative hybridomas may be of value in the isolation of antigenic materials or more particularly in other contexts, for example for the adjuvant properties. Such alternative hybridomas may, for instance, be obtained by fusing spleen cells from Balb c mice immunised with antigenic materials containing the 5.1 1 epitope purified using antibody produced by an existing hybridoma, for example the 5.1 1 hybridoma, one suitable procedure employing the 5.1 1 Sepharose immunoadsorbent of Example 5. Hybridomas secreting antibodies with the same antigen combining site as the antibodies secreted by the hybridoma 5.1 1 but with different heavy chain isotypes may be generated by screening for, and the subsequent isolation of, somatic variant cells from the hybridoma 5.1 1 using, for example, a fluorescence activated cell sorter such as is described by Dangh It will be appreciated that hybridoma cell lines producing an antibody specific for different epitopes than the 5.1 1 epitope which are present in intra erythrocytic stage antigens in alternative strains of The present invention thus includes a hybridoma cell line which produces an antibody which is reactive with both the antigenic material as defined hereinbefore and the sporozoite surface of the parasite, and also any such antibody itself. In particular, the invention includes a hybridoma cell line which produces an antibody which is specific for the epitope 5.1 1 as described herein, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, and also any such antibody itself. Such hybridomas are preferably in substantially pure fom, i.e. being substantially free from any other hybridoma producing antibodies of different specificity, and the antibodies themselves are again preferably in substantially pure form, i.e. being substantially free from antibodies of a different specificity. The hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, which exemplifies hybridomas producing antibody specific for the epitope 5.1 1, was deposited with the National Collection of Animal Cell Cultures now the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures at the PHLS Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Porton Down, Salisbury, England, on 1st October 1984 under the accession number 84091801. As regards the general properties of the cell line 5.1 1, particularly as compared with the NS 1 myeloma from which it derives, the following may be stated. The cell line 5.1 1 grows in HAT medium i.e. in a supplemented culture medium, for example as described in Example 1, to which are added 13.61 mg litre hypoxanthine, 0.176 mg litre aminopterin and 3.88 mg litre thymidine and secretes mouse IgG1. Its appearance and growth characteristics in non selective media i.e. not a HAT or similar medium are similar to those of the NS 1 myeloma cell line. The following discussion relating to the production of antibodies from hybridomas according to the present invention and their use, particularly in the production of antigenic materials, is for simplicity presented in terms of antibodies specific for the epitope 5.1 1 and the production of antigenic materials containing that epitope. It will be appreciated, however, that in general terms the discussion is equally applicable to antibodies specific for other such intra erythrocytic stage epitopes as 5.1 1 which share an epitope with sporozoites and to the production of antigenic materials containing such other epitopes. Hybridomas secreting antibodies specific for an intra erythrocytic stage epitope as described hereinbefore, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, may be maintained by growth in various forms of nutrient culture medium. Accordingly, the present invention extends to a cell culture system comprising cells of a hybridoma secreting antibodies specific for an intra erythrocytic stage epitope as described hereinbefore, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, in a nutrient culture medium therefor. Such a maintenance cell culture system is conveniently an The production of antibodies by a hybridoma secreting antibodies specific for an intra erythrocytic stage epitope as described hereinbefore, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, may be effected through its culture in either an The choice between an In the case of an Examples of suitable tissue culture procedures of antibody production are massive growth in spinner containers and other known mass culture procedures which are well documented in the art. The Monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridomas secreting antibodies specific for an intra erythrocytic stage epitope as described hereinbefore, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, show the unusual characteristic among monoclonal antibodies raised against the intra erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite of giving a strongly positive reaction to sporozoite preparations. Thus, for the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, activity has been observed with such preparations at a 1 in 10⁶ dilution level of ascitic fluid containing the antibodies whilst a variety of other monoclonal antibodies raised against intra erythrocytic stages have been tested and found not to react with sporozoites at a dilution level of 1 in 10². Antibodies specific for the epitope 5.1 1 have been found to show the same high level of activity against intra erythrocytic stages for most, but not all, of a wide range of Monoclonal antibodies obtained from hybridomas secreting antibodies specific for an intra erythrocytic stage epitope as described hereinbefore, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, are of potential interest as an immunodiagnostic reagent. The immunofluorescence pattern of the 5.1 1 epitope specific antibodies reacted with intra erythrocytic stages strongly suggests that the naturally occurring 5.1 1 epitope containing antigen known from extensive biochemical studies to be synthesised The major use of the monoclonal antibodies obtained from hybridomas secreting antibodies specific for an intra erythrocytic stage epitope as described hereinbefore, for example the hybridoma cell line 5.1 1, does, however, lie in their value in the production of antigenic materials containing the epitope for which the antibody is specific. The monoclonal antibody may be used in two main ways for the production of antigenic materials containing the epitope in question. Firstly the antibody may be used in the production of such antigenic materials deriving from nature. The antibody may be used either solely in the detection of the desired material or more actively in its isolation and or purification. It has been found possible using 5.1 1 epitope specific antibodies and a This antigenic substance may conveniently be obtained by the cleavage of Since the 23,000 daltons molecular weight antigenic substance cannot readily be isolated from the nitrocellulose, it is preferred to utilise an affinity chromatography procedure involving 5.1 1 epitope specific antibody to effect isolation of an antigenic material containing the 5.1 1 epitope. It has been found, however, that such a procedure leads to an antigenic substance which, instead of having a molecular weight of 23,000 daltons has a molecular weight estimated by SDS PAGE as 22,000 daltons 21,000 to 23,000 daltons within the range of accuracy of the method , apparently due to some specific cleavage during the purification procedure. Accordingly, the antigenic materials as defined hereinbefore also particularly comprise that antigenic substance derivable from For use in an affinity chromatography purification procedure the 5.1 1 epitope specific antibody may conveniently be attached to a support material in order to provide an immobilised solid phase with which the antigenic substance is contacted. The present invention thus includes monoclonal antibodies specific for a shared epitope as described hereinbefore, for example antibodies specific for the epitope 5.1 1 such as those secreted by the hybridoma 5.1 1, in insolubilised form through immobilisation on a solid support material. The solid phase may comprise one of a variety of forms of polymeric material suitable as the basis of an immunoadsorbent. Such materials are described in the literature in relation to gel filtration chromatography of proteins and include carbohydrate materials based upon dextran, agar or agarous and also polyacylamide based materials, cross linking conveniently being used to impart the required degree of exclusion of molecules depending upon size and shape. Examples of such materials are marketed under the trade names Sepharose agarose based , Sephadex dextran based and Sephacryl allyldextran based with cross linking by an acrylamide derivative . The agarose material marketed under the trade name Sepharose 4B is one example of a suitable material. The antibodies may be attached to the support material through the use of one of various methods described in the literature by which proteins or other materials may be attached to insoluble solid phase supports of use in affinity chromatography. The chemical reactions described effect covalent bond attachment, but by a non denaturing methodology so that destruction of the attached labile substances is minimised. Examples of suitable linking agents include the 1,4 bis 2,3 epoxypropoxy butane type of linking agent and particularly cyanogen bromide, these linking agents being suitable for use with non derivatised support materials such as those carbohydrate materials specified above. Alternatively, various derivatised support materials containing a reactive functional group may be used with or without a separate linking agent, depending on their particular nature. Thus, for example, the material CNBr activated Sepharose 4B marketed by Pharmacia is particularly useful. For the affinity chromatography purification procedure, infected erythrocytes again conveniently provide the source material, and in this case the erythrocyte cleavage and parasite protein extraction are more conveniently achieved simply by contact with a suitable surface active agent containing medium which avoids any extensive degree of proteolysis and denaturation. Non ionic detergents are preferred as the surface active agent, such as those of the derivatised ethylene oxide condensate type, with Nonidet P40 an octyl phenol ethylene oxide condensate being of particular interest, at a suitable concentration usually between 0.01 and 5 v v, for example 1 v v. A suitable medium consists of a buffer of 50mM 2 amino 2 hydroxymethylpropane 1,3 diol hydrochloride Tris HCl of pH 8.0, 5mM ethylenediamine N,N tetraacetate EDTA , 5mM ethyleneglycol bis aminoethyl ether N,N tetraacetate EDTA , 5mM iodoacetamide, 1mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride and 0.1mM tosyl L lysine chloromethyl ketone TLCK containing 1 v v NP40. The protein extract is applied to the affinity chromatography column which is then processed to provide the desired protein in purified form. Such processing conveniently involves washing to remove proteins which are not specifically bound, for example using the same buffer as that used previously but lacking the surface active agent, followed by elution of the specifically bound protein through the use of an agent which will disrupt the complex on the column. Suitable conditions which preserve the immunogenicity of the protein include the use of urea, for example at 8M concentration. Suitable methods for recovery of the protein from the eluate include concentration and dialysis. The present invention thus further includes a process for the preparation of an antigenic material as defined hereinbefore which comprises absorbing said antigenic material or a precursor thereof on a solid support material which carries monoclonal antibodies reactive with both the sporozoite surface of a parasite of the species The antigenic substances of molecular weight 23,000 and 22,000 daltons are now further described, any one or any combination of the properties described for these substances being available for their characterisation in addition to the properties mentioned previously. Both substances are proteinaceous, i.e. substantially, but not necessarily exclusively, of protein form. The 5.1 1 epitope, which is not necessarily the sole epitope contained by these subtances, is present in their primary amino acid sequence and does not require post translational processing for its generation. This is shown by the fact that the primary translation product made It will be appreciated that various other antigenic materials of lower molecular weight containing the 5.1 1 epitope may also be prepared by treatment of the naturally occurring material of 23,000 daltons molecular weight. Moreover, as discussed hereinafter, it is sometimes desirable to attach antigenic materials containing the 5.1 1 or other such epitope to a carrier such as a protein in order to enhance their immunogenicity and this may even produce materials of higher molecular weight than the naturally occurring materials. Thus, whilst the molecular weight range of 20,000 to 25,000 daltons given hereinbefore is a preferred one, it will be appreciated that antigenic materials according to the present invention can be of a wide range of size. The second way in which 5.1 1 epitope specific antibodies may be used in the production of antigenic materials containing the 5.1 1 epitope involves the use of genetic engineering procedures for the synthesis of protein or peptide substances containing the epitope. In one particular aspect, therefore, the present invention comprises an antigenic material suitable for use in vaccination against malaria as defined hereinbefore being a synthetic immunogenic peptide or protein, especially one produced by genetic engineering. One approach using genetic engineering procedures involves the use of A second approach using genetic engineering procedures involves the cloning of cDNA molecules corresponding to residues of the sequence amino acids present in the naturally occurring antigenic materials described hereinbefore in order to be able to produce synthetic antigenic materials falling within the scope of the present invention. Such an approach has been employed with an antigen of By the application of genetic engineering techniques and starting with a Accordingly the anitgenic material suitable for use in vaccination against malaria as defined hereinbefore may comprise the whole or a portion or portions of the following sequence of one hundred and sixty two amino acid residues It will be appreciated that the whole of the amino acid sequence given above need not be present for the antigenic material to be suitable for use in vaccination against malaria. An antigenic material comprising a smaller amino acid sequence may be of value immunogenically due to the presence in that sequence of one or more intra erythrocytic epitopes, particularly the 5.1 1 epitope. Such an epitope is more likely to correspond to a sequence or a combination of sequences consisting in total of at least five and especially at least ten of the amino acid residues indicated, particularly fifteen or more residues. Where more than one non consecutive sequence of the amino acid residues indicated is present, each of these sequences is also likely to contain at least four or five residues. Thus, without thereby limiting the scope of the present invention, it may be stated that the 5.1 1 epitope is believed to be constituted by the sequence of eighteen amino acid residues underlined in Figure 5 Asn Ala Asn Pro Asp Ala Asp Ser Glu Ser Asn Gly Glu Pro Asn Ala Asp Pro, this sequence having homology with the tandemly repeated tetramer which is present in the circumsporozoite protein. This tetramer consists of the amino acid residues Asn Ala Asn Pro and the sequence of amino acid residues consisting of this repeated tetramer, and a variation thereon in which the Ala is replaced by Val and the second Asn by Asp to give the sequence Asn Val Asp Pro, is believed to constitue the shared epitope in its sporozoite form. It will be seen that although there is a degree of similarity, the intra erythrocytic and sporozoite epitopes are not identical. Among the eighteen amino acid residues of the intra erythrocytic stage epitope, it is believed that the fifteen residues not included in the brackets are of particular importance and that the three residues Ser Glu Ser may simply provide an appropriate juxtaposition between the sequence of seven and eight residues on either side thereof. It is possible therefore that these three residues could be replaced by others, particularly by other residues generally regarded in the art as being related thereto, so that the replacement of Ser by Ala and of Glu by Asp may for example be considered. Alternatively it may even be possible to remove this sequence of three residues entirely, although it is believed that the presence of a group of amino acid residues, particularly of three residues, separating the Asn Ala Asn Pro Asp Ala Asp and Asn Gly Glu Pro Asn Ala Asp Pro sequences is probably desirable. It should be stressed, however, that the full amino acid sequence is believed to contain not only the 5.1 1 epitope and that the presence of other epitopes in the sequence is believed to be of value in providing an antigenic material of maximum efficacy in vaccination both against Although it is therefore possible to utilise antigenic materials containing only a part of the amino acid sequence given hereinbefore, it is likely that any significant reduction, even with retention of the 5.1 1 epitope, may lead to loss of the sites of other valuable epitopes present in the full sequence. In general, therefore, although the synthetic antigenic materials according to the present invention may contain a somewhat reduced amino acid sequence, for example one lacking certain of the residues located at the N and or the C terminus of the sequence, such antigenic materials of particular interest have a molecular weight, as estimated by SDS PAGE, which is not less than 20,000 or 22,000 daltons, for example lying in the range of 22,000 to 24,000 daltons specified hereinbefore. Examples of smaller antigenic materials than that containing the full amino acid sequence given hereinbefore include the proteins of molecular weights 22,000 and 23,000 daltons, as estimated by SDS PAGE, which have been obtained in addition to a protein of molecular weight 24,000 daltons on expression of the gene present in the clone λAg5.1 9 , as discussed hereinafter. A further example of an antigenic material containing a part of the full amino acid sequence is one containing the whole or a part of the amino acid sequence corresponding to that partial sequence of the gene which is present in the alternative clone λAg5.1 8 , as described hereinafter. This smaller amino acid sequence corresponds to the sixty nine C terminal amino acids of the full sequence, having an N terminal glycine residue which corresponds to the ninety fourth amino acid residue of the full sequence, and a C terminal histidine residue. Another smaller antigenic material containing a part of the full sequence is a peptide corresponding to the fifteen amino acid residues identified hereinbefore as being responsible for the specificity of the 5.1 1 epitope, preferably together with a group of separating amino acid residues, for example three residues and particularly Ser Glu Ser as present in nature. Although antigens having a molecular weight in a range from 20,000 to 25,000 daltons should be fully immunogenic, if smaller antigenic materials are used, such as a peptide corresponding to the 5.1 1 epitope, these may have molecular weights which are too small for satisfactory functioning as an immunogen. This is of course the case not only for synthetic antigenic materials but also for materials produced by cleavage of the naturally ocurring antigens. It will be appreciated, therefore, that antigenic materials according to the present invention include those in which a peptide or protein corresponding to the whole or particularly a part of the full amino acid sequence is attached to a suitable carrier, particularly a carrier protein such as the natural proteins bovine serum albumin and more particularly ovalbumin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and synthetic polypeptides such as polylysine. The initial requirement for the application of the second approach using genetic engineering procedures referred to hereinbefore is the isolation and identification of the whole or a part of the gene coding for the naturally occurring antigenic material which it is required to produce in whole or in part. It will be appreciated that a number of approaches are possible to this problem, as will be apparent to the man skilled in the art. Thus, it is possible to make use of Total messenger RNA from erythrocytic stages of the parasite is converted to cDNA and linkers containing restriction sites for the endonuclease The phage carrying the cDNA fragments is used to infect an The procedure described above is illustrated in more detail in the Examples and has led to the isolation of two phage clones of particular interest. These clones have been designated by us as λAg5.1 8 and λAg5.1 9 , the latter having been deposited as an The inserts in the two clones λAg5.1 8 and λAg5.1 9 have been investigated by the usual procedure of growing the phage in the form of Both the clones have been shown to express a protein which will react with antibodies produced by the 5.1 1 hybridoma and therefore contain the 5.1 1 epitope, the insert in clone λAg5.1 8 overlapping for a very large part thereof with part of the nucleotide sequence of the clone λAg5.1 9 . It is believed that most, if not all, of the structural gene for the naturally occurring intra erythrocytic stage The present invention thus further includes recombinant DNA comprising a cloning vehicle sequence and DNA which comprises either the whole or a portion or portions of the following nucleotide sequence including a sequence coding for an epitope present in intra erythrocytic forms of a parasite of the species or which comprises an equivalent nucleotide sequence coding for the same amino acid residues. It will be appreciated that the usage employed in this specification is the common one of showing only a single strand of the DNA sequence although the DNA will of course exist as two strands, the structure of the second strand however being dictated by that of the first so that ony one strand need be shown. Furthermore, since a particular amino acid can be encoded by more than one triplet, the invention does extend to alternative DNA which is equivalent in its coding to the whole or a part of the sequence specificed. Indeed, it is possible that other strains Smaller nucleotide sequences than the whole which are of particular interest will correspond to the antigenic materials discussed hereinbefore which contain only a portion or portions of the amino acid sequence present in the protein which is the primary translation product. Such DNA not comprising the whole sequence may, for example, correspond to antigenic materials with a molecular weight of 22,000 to 24,000 daltons or to an amino acid sequence as discussed hereinbefore which constitutes an epitope, i.e. being a sequence or combination of sequences which are more likely to contain in total at least five and especially at least ten of the condons indicated, particularly fifteen or more codons, such as the nucleotide sequence AAT GCT AAC CCA GAT GCT GAT TCT GAA TCC AAT GGA GAA CCA AAT GCA GAC CCA underlined in Figure 5 or other sequence coding for the same amino acid residues. In this sequence the nucleotides TCT GAA TCC joining the codons GAT and AAT, in particular, may optionally be replaced by three alternative codons coding for the three amino acid residues Ser Glu Ser. Alternatively, it may be possible to replace these nucleotides by others coding for different amino acid residues, particularly for a total of three residues, and it may also even be possible to omit these nucleotides completely. As discussed below, the nucleotide sequence coding for the desired antigenic material will in use generally be linked to other nucleotides serving various functions related to the expression of that material. For expression of a desired antigenic material, such a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the structural gene or a portion thereof needs to be located in a suitable cloning vehicle. The present invention thus also includes recombinant DNA which comprises a cloning vehicle sequence and the nucleotide sequence defined above or a portion thereof, for example recombinant DNA as is present in the clones λAg5.1 8 and λAg5.1 9 . It will be appreciated that a wide variety of such cloning vehicles may be employed, for example In order for the recombinant DNA comprising a cloning vehicle and the structural gene, or a portion thereof, to express the desired antigenic material it will be appreciated that the recombinant DNA should contain appropriate expression control sequences, i.e. promoter and terminator DNA sequences to effect transcription, translation stop and start signals, and optionally other regulatory sites advantageously affecting expression. An example of an additional form of regulation having beneficial effects is the ability to switch off expression of the gene during the initial stages of culture of the host. Thus, the The sequences controlling transcription will usually be provided by the host cloning vehicle DNA, for example the promotion of transcription being effected by the DNA normally controlling the transcription of β galactosidase in the case of the λgt11 Amp3 phage. The sequences providing the translation start and stop signals however, usually may derive either from the cloning vehicle or from Recombinant DNA according to the present invention thus conveniently further comprises, in addition to the DNA coding for the For the production of a protein by expression from the cloning vehicle, this vehicle is necessarily comprised in a host. The host can with particular convenience be a bacterium, for example a strain of To produce an antigenic material according to the present invention a host as described above is cultured under suitable conditions to effect expression from the cloning vehicle. The conditions selected will be appropriate to the host cloning vehicle combination so that for an As previously indicated, the use of the clones λAg5.1 8 and λAg5.1 9 leads to different types of product in the two cases. Thus, the λAg5.1 8 clone produces a fusion protein between β galactosidase and a 7,700 daltons by SDS PAGE As an alternative to the production of the antigenic materials described herein synthetically by genetic engineering techniques, materials corresponding to smaller peptides, in particular, may be prepared synthetically by chemical synthesis using standard techniques in the art of peptide synthesis. The gentic engineering techniques described herein may of course be applied to the production of antigenic materials containing the whole or a part of an antigen of various strains of The antigenic materials of the present invention are of particular value for incorporation into vaccines for inducing immunity to malaria in susceptible vertebrate hosts which are at risk of becoming infected by parasites of the genus Whilst it is preferred that the antigenic materials according to the present invention are used in the vaccines in a form substantially free from by products of their preparation, it will be appreciated that the materials may be incorporated into the vaccines either singly or in combination either together with another such antigenic material or with a different antigenic material of value in such a context. In particular, it may be advantageous to include in a single the vaccine antigenic materials which on administration The present invention thus includes a pharmaceutical composition which comprises an antigenic material suitable for use in vaccination against malaria ass defined hereinbefore together with a physiologically acceptable diluent or carrier. The diluents or carriers of particular interest are liquid media, a particular example being saline solution which may conveninetly be sterile and pyrogen free. The antigenic material may be in solution or suspension or may be solubilised by the addition of a physiologically acceptable detergent. The vaccine may, if desired, comprise some form of adjuvant for stimulating the immune response to the antigenic material, examples of adjuvant material which may be included as a separate component of the vaccine being saponin, Conveniently the vaccines are formulated to contain a final concentration of antigenic protein in the range from 0.2 to 5 mg ml, preferably 0.5 to 2 mg ml, for example 1 mg ml. After formulation, conveniently in unit dosage form i.e. in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub unit dose the vaccine may be incorporated into a sterile container which is then sealed and stored at a low temperature, for example 4 C, or may be freeze dried. The doses envisaged in vertebrate hosts are at a level of 0.1 to 2 ml, preferably 0.2 to 1 ml, for example 0.5 ml, of vaccine containing the quantities of antigenic protein indicated previously. The vaccines may be administered by any convenient route although parenteral for example subcutaneous or intramuscular injection administration is of particular value, conveniently employing sterile, pyrogen free formulations. The treatment may consist of a single dose of vaccine or a plurality of doses administered over a period of time. The present invention thus includes an antigenic material suitable for use in vaccination against malaria as defined hereinbefore, for use in therapy. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples. The procedure used is a modification of the protocol of Perrin Female Balb c mice are immunized intraperitoneally with organisms released from host red cells, using a dose from 100 to 200 µg of total protein incorporated in incomplete Freunds s adjuvant given on 2 4 occasions separated by intervals of 2 weeks. The parasites are obtained by the use of a modification of the saponin treatment of Zuckerman At 2 to 16 weeks after the last intraperitoneal injection, the mice are injected intravenously with a similar preparation of parasites but in saline without adjuvant, a dose of 100 Σg of protein being used. Three days later the mice are killed and spleen cells obtained therefrom are fused with NS 1 1 Ag4 1 NS 1 myeloma cells Kohler Using the above described procedure a set of five separate fusions led to a total of 590 hybrid cultures of which 137 secreted antiplasmodial antibodies as detected by IFA. From these 137 hybrid cultures, 22 selected hybridomas were successfully cloned using limiting dilution cloning with the addition of syngeneic thymocytes as feeder cells 1 2 x 10⁵ per microculture in 0.2 ml . The cultures were examined microscopically for the presence of hybridoma colonies ten days later, and supernatants from cultures containing only a single cluster of cells were screened for the presence of antimalarial antibody. Usually, 4 6 clones per primary hybridoma line were selected and expanded through passages firstly into 1 ml cluster tray cultures and later in flask cultures 10 ml . The culture medium from each cloned hybridoma cell line was studied by IFA, various types of reactivity pattern being identified. From the 22 cell lines, one hybridoma cell line was selected on the basis of the strong reaction shown by its culture medium to a sporozoite preparation and was designated by the number 5.1 1, having been obtained by cloning of the hybrid culture 5.1 . The hybridoma cell line 5.1 1 was maintained in culture at 37 C in a medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplied by Gibco containing 10 15 v v of foetal calf serum FCS supplied by Seralab Laboratories , with supplementation by sodium pyruvate to 1mM, glutamine to 2mM, penicillin to 500 units ml and streptomycin to 500 mcg ml supplements also supplied by Gibco and with the addition of sodium bicarbonate at a level of 0.2 w v to produce a pH of 7.4. The cells were maintained in static cell culture at a density of 2 6 x 10⁵ cells ml by dilution into fresh medium every 24 72 hours, being harvested once sufficient cells were generated. The atmosphere above the culture was maintained at 5 6 CO₂ in air with 85 95 relative humidity. The cell line 5.1 1 has proved stable to growth by passaging in static culture for a period of at least two months but it may be desirable to reclone it periodically if growth in tissue culture is to be maintained for a prolonged period . The cells deposited in the culture collection had been cloned once by limiting dilution into microcultures containing 0.2 ml of medium and 10⁵ Balb c thymocytes as feeder cells. For the preparation of samples for storage and of those for deposit , a suspension of the cells in culture medium is centrifuged at 250 g for 5 minutes. The cell pellet is suspended at room temperature in a freezing mixture which consists of 1 volume DMSO, 4 volumes of FCS and 5 volume of RPMI 1640, with a cell concentration not exceeding about 2 x 10⁶ ml. Cell aliquots to be frozen are closed in 2 ml plastic vials which are placed in a small about 15 x 15 x 15 cm³ well insulated polystyrene box. This is kept at 20 C for 3 hours and at 60 C overnight to allow slow cooling down and freezing of the cells. The vials are then transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage. An alternative freezing mixture consists of 90 v v FCS 10 v v dimethyl sulphoxide at a density of 1 5 x 10⁶ cells ml. To recover the cryopreserved cells, an aliquot is rapidly thawed in a 37 C incubator, the cells are washed in about 10 ml of serum free medium and then set up in the RPMI 1640 medium with 20 FCS at a concentration of about 5 x 10⁵ cells ml the addition of thymocyte feeders at this stage is beneficial . When the cells begin to divide well, typically after 1 2 days, the culture is maintained and or expanded as described previously. 5.1 1 hybridoma cells produced in tissue culture as described in Example 1 are grown as tumours by intraperitoneal inoculation into Balb c mice. Each mouse receives about 3 x 10⁶ washed cells in the culture medium described in Example 1 but lacking serum after an initial priming 2 7 days previously with 0.5 ml pristane 2,6,10,14 tetramethylpentadecane Aldrich Chemical Co. . Ascitic fluid is collected daily once the tumour develops. Antibody is prepared from the ascitic fluid by precipitation using 50 saturated ammonium sulphate, followed by ion exchange chromatography on diethyl amino ethyl cellulose Whatman DE52 with an exponential convex gradient between the buffers of 0.005M sodium phosphate pH 8.0 and 0.18M sodium phosphate pH 8.0 . 5.1 1 cells produced in tissue culture as described in Example 1 are cultured in a similar RPMI 1640 based medium as described in that Example but containing 10 v v of FCS, the culture being carried out in tissue culture flasks containing 50 ml of medium. When the medium above the cells turns acid, the cells are discarded and the supernatant harvested to prepare antibody by an analogous procedure to that described under 1 above involving NH₄ ₂SO₄ precipitation and DE52 chromatography. The monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma 5.1 1 was tested according to the procedure described by McBride The monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma 5.1 1 shows selective reactivity against most, but not all, of a wide range of The indirect immunofluorescence staining of An asynchronous The proteins separated in the electrophoresis gel are transferred to nitrocellulose paper using the procedure known as Western blotting described by Towbin For ease of comparison of the protein occurring An affinity chromatography column is prepared by binding the monoclonal antibody 5.1 1, purified from ascites fluid by ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE ion exchange chromatography, to CNBr activated Sepharose 4B Pharmacia according to the procedure prescribed by the manufacturer. This procedure involves reactivation of the CNBr activated Sepharose 4B by washing in 1mM HCl. The immunoglobulin in 0.1M NaHCO₃, 0.5M NaCl is then contacted under rotation with the Sepharose material for 2 hours to effect binding therewith. The remaining binding sites on the material are inactivated by treatment thereof under rotation for 2 hours with 0.2M glycine of pH 8.0, followed by washing 3x in sequence with 0.1M acetate, 0.5M NaCl of pH 4.0 and 0.1M NaHCO₃, 0.5M NaCl. The resulting affinity chromatography material is stored in PBS. Protein extracts from asynchronous cultures of To produce a solid product, the eluate is dialysed against Tris buffered physiological saline ph 7.4 , followed by concentration by lyophilisation. Characterising data on the protein of this Example is provided in Example 7. Proteins are synthesised in a reticulocyte lysate A portion of the translated material equivalent to 5 x 10⁶ cpm is treated on a 5.1 1 monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography column as described in Example 5. Characterising data on the protein of this Example is provided in Example 7. Figure 2 shows nine tracks typical of those obtained characterising the proteins of Examples 4, 5 and 6, which proteins are found to have molecular weight estimated at 23,000 daltons, 22,000 daltons and 24,500 daltons, respectively. The various tracks are obtained as follows The following molecular weight markers MWtM, Pharmacia are used to provide the scale shown in Figure 2 ferritin 220,000 , phosphorylase b 94,000 , albumin 67,000 , catalase 60,000 , ovalbumin 43,000 , lactate dehydrogenase 36,000 , carbonic anhydrase 30,000 , trypsin inhibitor 20,100 , ferritin 18,500 and α lactalbumin 14,400 . It will be seen in Figure 2 that in track 4 derived from total protein a single band carries the 5.1 1 epitope and that this band migrates as a protein with an estimated molecular weight of 23,000 daltons. Tracks 3 and 5 also show a single band carrying the epitope but in these instances the protein, which is the affinity chromatography purified material, migrates slightly faster at a rate corresponding to an estimated molecular weight of 22,000 daltons. Track 9 derived from chromatographed ³⁵S methionine labelled mRNA total translated protein shows that the affinity chromatography column traps several of the Figure 3 shows six tracks typical of those obtained characterising the reaction of the proteins of Examples 4 and 5 estimated molecular weight 23,000 daltons and 22,000 daltons, respectively with human sera. The tracks are obtained as follows In Figure 3 the bands revealed by the monoclonal antibodies 5.1 1 B and by endemic sera C are specific. No bands are seen with the non immune serum D . In track B1 the 5.1 1 epitope is detected in the form of the estimated 23,000 dalton molecular weight protein whilst in track B2 it appears in the form of the estimated 22,000 dalton molecular weight protein. The pooled human sera detect many antigens among the total parasite proteins in C1 but there is one particularly strong band arrowed which a comparison of band positions and intensities in tracks 1 and 2 of B and C suggests to be the 23,000 dalton estimated molecular weight protein. It is found that the affinity chromatography purifed protein attached to Sepharose will typically bind with as much as 1 of the antibodies in this pooled sera. A library of For screening of the λgt11 Amp3 cDNA library a polyclonal antibody probe specific for the natural erythrocytic stage The polyclonal antibody is used to screen the λgt11 Amp3 cDNA library by a procedure analogous to that described by Young and Davis, Following the identification by this screening procedure of lysogens containing recombinant phage of particular interest, the recombinant phage, and the corresponding DNA and protein are obtained as follows. DNA is prepared from the purified phage as follows. The suspension of phage is mixed with an equal volume of phenol chloroform 1 1 v v to remove proteinaceous material, the aqueous phase being collected, this extraction procedure being performed four times. The final aqueous layer is then extracted twice with ether and the residual layer containing the DNA is treated with proteinase K 0.5 mg ml final concentration in a buffer pH 8.0 containing Tris 50 mM and SDS 0.05 v v to denature and digest residual protein. The treated solution is again extracted once with phenol chloroform 1 1 v v and twice with ether. Finally the DNA is precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in Tris EDTA pH 8.0 . The The procedure described in Example 9 was utilised to obtain two particular clones in the form of The DNA inserts contained in these clones have been isolated as described, recloned into M13mp11 Messing The two cDNA inserts overlap towards the 3 ends thereof, as is apparent from a comparison of Figures 5 a and 5 b . It will be seen that there is a sequence of 15 base pairs following the At its 5 terminus the λAg5.1 8 insert has an open reading frame in phase with β galactosidase causing fusion of the β galactosidase and of the It is believed that the coding sequence present in clone λAg5.1 9 comprising nucleotides 1 to 486 probably corresponds to the whole of the coding sequence of the natural structural gene since it directs the synthesis of a one hundred and sixty two amino acid residue protein of a close, if not identical, mobility to that of the natural protein. The sequence of 18 amino acid residues running from asparagine 120 to proline 137, Asn Ala Asn Pro Asp Ala Asp Ser Glu Ser Asn Gly Glu Pro Asn Ala Asp Pro, is believed to form the intra erythrocytic stage epitope which is shared with the surface of the sporozoites, the fifteen non bracketed residues being those believed to be of particular importance The proteins from the two clones λAg5.1 8 and λAg5.1 9 were separated by SDS PAGE according to the procedure of Laemmli referred to under Protein Preparation using the 10 w v gels appropriate to the range of molecular weight which is of interest. The separated proteins were Western blotted to nitrocellulose and immunologically probed using horseradish peroxidase conjugated second antibodies by the procedures of Towbin, The It will be seen from Figure 6 that the λAg5.1 8 lysogens make a fusion protein which is larger than the native β galactosidase sub unit compare tracks 1, 2 and 4 and which is recognised by the polyclonal human antibody probe see tracks 7 and 10 . By contrast, the control lysogen containing the vector alone makes a β galactosidase sub unit of normal size which is detected only by the anti β galactosidase antibody see tracks 2 and 8 . The λAg5.1 9 lysogens do not make a fusion protein since the expressed β galactosidase sub unit is of unchanged size see track 3 and only binds with the antibody against the enzyme see tracks 6 and 9 . However, they do make proteins which bind the human polyclonal antibody, suggesting that in this clone translation of the protein containing the 5.1 1 epitope initiates independently. There are 3 bands of similar size see tracks 6 and 9 and of these, one migrates with substantially the same mobility M
