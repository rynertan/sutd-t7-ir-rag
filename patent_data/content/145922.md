# EJECTOR HOLDER AND CAPSULE LIKE CARTRIDGE THEREFOR

## Abstract
A capsule like cartridge comprising a cylindrical body 10 of uniform diameter open at one end and provided with an annular flange 11 surrounding the open end 10₁ , the other end being closed by an integral hemi spherical end 10₂ of the same radius as said body and provided with an angularly extending discharge nipple 15 communicating with the interior of the hemi spherical end and body. After the body is loaded with a precisely measured quantity of material, the open end 10₁ is closed by a piston 12₁ slidably movable along said body the opposite end being complementary in shape to the hemispherical end of the body whereby the entire measured amount of material in the body except the scintilla thereof lodged in the nipple is discharged. The body and piston are moulded from opaque material impervious to the passage of light and the tip of the nipple is closed by a cap 14 which may be colour coded to indicate various facts as kind of material, weight or quan tity, or otherwise.
