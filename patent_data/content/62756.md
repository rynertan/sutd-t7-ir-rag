# Panel mounting clip assembly and wall or roof structure utilizing the same.

## Abstract
A panel mounting clip assembly is adapted to connect the intermediate longitudinal ribs 26 of panel members and the rib like joints between adjacent ones of the panel members to panel support members. The clip assembly comprises a base member 40 that is fastened to the panel support member and a top clip 38 that is frictionally engaged with interior surfaces of the ribs 26 or joints to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction of the panels. The top clip to base member connection provides for movement of the top clip 38 transversely of the length of the panel member thereby to accommodate rib to clip and joint to clip misalignments. The top clip to base member connection also provides for limited universal movement of the top clip 38 relative to the base member 40 to accommodate any inherent minor distortions in the profile of the intermediate ribs 26 or the panel elements of the rib like joint. A roof or wall structure utilizing the panel mounting clip assembly is described. A joint retention clip for maintain ing the elements of the rib like joint in assembled relation in the region between adjacent panel support members is described.
