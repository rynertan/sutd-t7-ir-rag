## Description
NITRO COMPOUNDS, PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEM AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEN This invention relates to nitro compounds showing activity as histamine H2 receptor antagonists, their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Many physiologically active substances elicit their biological actions by interaction with specific sites known as receptors. Histamine is such a substance and it has multiple biological actions. Those biological actions of histamine which are inhibited by drugs commonly called antihistamines , of which mepyramine, diphenhydramine and chloropheniramine are typical examples, are mediated through histamine H1 receptors. However, others of the biological actions of histamine are not inhibited by antihistamines , and actions of this type which are inhibited by burimamide are mediated through receptors which are termed histamineH2 receptors, and H2 receptors are defined as those histamine receptors which are not blocked by mepyramine but are blocked by burimamide.Compounds which block histamine H2 receptcrs are referred to as histamine 2 preceptor antagonists. Blockade of histamine H2 receptors is of value in inhibiting the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by antihistamines . Histamine H2 receptor antagonists are therefore useful, for example, as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, as anti inflainmatory agents, and as agents which act on the cardiovascular system, for example as inhibitors of the effects of histamine on blood pressure.

The compounds of Structure 1 can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula Het CH2 mY where Y is Z CH2 nNH2 or optionally when m is 1 or 2 a leaving group displaceable by a mercaptan, for example halogen, trisubstituted phosphonium for example triphenylphosphonium or substituted sulphonyloxy for example p toluenesulphonyloxy, methanesulphonyloxy or trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy with a compound of Structure 2 EMI5.1 Structure 2 where X is QSO or QS02 where Q is lower alkyl, aryl or group arylalkyl, or another leaving which is displaceable with an amine when Y is Z CH2 nNH2, and X is HS CH2 nNH when Y is a leaving group displaceable by a mercaptan. This reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent, for example a lower alkanol. In general, an elevated temperature will be used, for example t e boiling point of the reaction mixture. X is preferably QSO , Q preferably being methyl or benzyl. will be appreciated that when Fl and R2 are hydrogen or are lower alkyl substituted by lower alkyl amino it may be necessary to protect amino groups in the R1R2N Asubstituents of compounds of the formula tet CH2 mY to prevent competing side reactions. The compounds of Structure 1 and the intermediate compounds of Structure 2 where X is QSO or QSO2 can be prepared by reaction of a compound of Structure 3EMI6.1 Structure 3 Structure 4 in which E is Het CH2 mZ CH2 nNX or QS and X1 is QS or when E is QS QSO with an aminoketone of formula H2NCHR4 COR3 or an aminoacetal or aminoketal of formula H2NCHR4CR3 0R5 2 where R5 is lower alkyl. It will be appreciated that when E is Het CH2 mZ CH2 nNH and Het has a substituent including a primary or secondary amino group, such amino groups should be protected during tis reaction.When an aminoketone is used, the reaction will in general be carried out under basic conditions, for example with sodium ethoxide in ethanol, and the reaction gives a compound of structure 4 directly. When an aminoacetal or aminoketal is used, the reaction is preferably carried out under neutral conditions, for example in boiling ethanol, and the product cyclised under acidic conditions, for, example by treatment with hydrogen chloride in a solvent for example ether or a lower alkanol , to give a compound of Structure 4. A compound of Structure 4 in which E is QS can be converted into a compound of Structure 2 wherein X is QSO by reaction with one equivalent of hydrogen peroxide, and it can be converted Into a compound of Structure 2 wherein X isQS02 by reaction with two equivalents or more of hydrogen peroxide. The intermediates of Structure 2 where X is HS CH2 nNd can be prepared by reacting a compound ofStructure 2 where X is QSO or QS02 with an amine of formula HS CH2 nNH2 The compounds of Structure 1 block histamineH2 receptors that is, they inhibit the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by anti histamines such as mepyramine but are inhibited by burimamide. For example, they inhibit histamine stimulated secretion of gastric acid from the lumen perfused stomachs of rats anaesthetised with urethane, at doses of from 0.5 to 256 micromoles per kilogram intravenously.Their activity as histamine H2 receptor antagonists is also demonstrated by their ability to inhibit other actions of histamine which are not mediated by histamine H1 receptors. For example, they inhibit the actions of histamine on the isolated guinea pig atrium and isolated rat uterus. They inhibit the basal secretion of gastric acid and also that stimulated by pentagastrin or by food. In a conventional test such as the measurement of blood pressure in the anaesthetised cat, at doses of from 0.5 to 256 micromoles per kilogram intravenously, they inhibit the vasodilator action of histamine.The potency of the compounds is illustrated by an effective dose producing 50 inhibition of gastric acid secretion in the anaesthetised rat and 50 inhIbition of histamineinduced tachycardia in the isolated guinea pig atrium less than 10 4 Molar . For therapeutic use, the pharmacologically active compounds will normally be adrrnistered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one such compound in the form of the free base or in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts With an acid and in association with a pharmaceutical diluent or carrier. Such addition salts include those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulphuric and maleic acids, and the salts can conveniently be formed from the correspcnding bases by standard procedure, for example by reacting the base with an acid in a lower alkanol or by tne use of ion exchange resins to form the required salt either directly fom the base or from a different addition salt. The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be solid or liquid. Examples of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil and water. If a solid carrier is used, the compositions can be prepared in the form of a tablet, capsule, troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier in a unit dosage form will generally be from about 25 mg to about 300 mg. If a liquid carrier is used, the compositions can be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, a sterile injectable lid for example contained in an ampoule, o an aqueous or non aqueous liquid suspension. The pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by conventional techniques involving procedures such as mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired form of composition.The compositions of the present invention are preferably in dosage unit form each containing sufficient active ingredient to block histamine H2 receptors. Each dosage unit preferably contains the active ingredient in an amount of from about 50 mg to about 250 mg. The invention provides a method of blocking histamine H2 receptors which comprises administering an active compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition containing it. The active ingredient is preferably administered from one to six times per day. The daily dosage regimen will generally be from about 150 mg to about 1500 mg.
