# Monitoring system for use with elongate heater units.

## Abstract
A monitoring system that may be employed with elongate heater units to provide information about a measur able parameter, for example the temperature of a heated substrate. The monitoring system may include many heater units and associated transmitter receiver assemblies. The heater units as well as the assemblies can all be of the same kind. The many heater units and assemblies can be con nected to a common power supply and the monitoring system can correlate the information provided by a particular receiver with a particular heater unit.
