## Abstract
The invention relates to germinated seeds of a plant spe cies other than one characterised by a seminal root system, for example seeds of small seeded vegetables, the seeds having emerged radicles and a moisture content at which radicle development is suspended without loss of seed viabil ity. Seeds may be subjected to a treatment which includes imbibing the seeds to a stage where radicles have emerged in a substantial proportion thereof and drying in a two stage process, the first stage comprising drying to a moisture con tent at which individual seeds are separable and free flowing and the second stage comprising drying in an atmosphere of fairly high relative humidity such as 70 to 90 at a tempera ture in the range 20 to 30 C.
