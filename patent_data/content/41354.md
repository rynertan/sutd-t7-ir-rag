# Method for producing cold rolled steel sheets having a noticeably excellent formability.

## Abstract
Non ageing cold rolled steel sheets having a very excel lent formability are produced by hot rolling a steel consisting of not more than 0.008 of C, not more than 0.20 of Si, 0.04 0.30 of Mn, not more than 0.03 of P, 0.01 0.10 of Aℓ, a content of Aℓ being more than N x4, not more than 0.02 of S, not more than 0.01 of N, 0.01 0.07 of Nb, a content of Nb being C x3 C x8 0.02 , and the remainder being substantially Fe, at a total reduction of not less than 90 , a rolling speed of not less than 40 m min in the finishing rolling and a finishing temperature of not lower than 830 C, coiling the hot rolled strip at a temperature of 600 800 C, cold rolling the coiled strip following to conventional manner to obtain a cold rolled strip having final gauge and then continuous annealing the cold rolled strip within a temperature range of 700 900 C for 10 seconds 5 minutes. It is possible to hot dip galvanize the thus treated strip continuously.
