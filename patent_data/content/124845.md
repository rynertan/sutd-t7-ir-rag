## Description
DEVICE EOR POSITIONING AN OPERATIONAL UNIT RELATIVELY 0 A WORKPIECE. IN PARTICULAR POR TRANSPER LINES This invention relates to a device for positioning an operational unit relatively to a workpiece, in particular for transfer lines. It is a known fact that on so called transfer lines, a workpiece is caused to advance from one working station to the next to undergo preset machining at each station. The biggest problem encountered with transfer lines is related to its adaptation for machining workpieces which are different from those machined previously, especially when the orientation and arrangement of the operational units relatively to the workpiece require to be changed. The engineering expense involved is such that it is often preferred to set up a new tranfer line.This expense is further aggravated by the need for adjusting the working travels of the operational units to carry out milling, planing, drilling, and the like operations as planned. From a constructional standpoint, prior devices have also proved to be somewhat complex and bulky, which reflects adversely on the whole plant. In view of the foregoing, the task of this invention is to provide a device for positioning operationerl units, which can carry out the position adjustment operations for the latter easier, while hating a simple con traction for its performance and moderate space requirements, thereby a number of such devices may be packed in a small volume. This task is attained by a device for positioning an operational unit relatively to a workpiece, characterized in that it comprises a guide extending along a curved line to a substantially C like pattern lying optionally on a vertical plane, and carrying an operational unit holder ad ustably positionable relatively to said guide and having at least one degree of freedom. Further features and advantages of this invention will be more readily understood from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings, where Figure 1 is an elevation view of that portion of this device which pertains to the C like guide Figure 2 is a plan view of the guide shown inFigure 1 Figure 3 is a sectional plan view of the guide of Figure 1 taken on the horizontal plane III III and showing, in dnsh and dot lines, the construction of a holder movable along it Figure 4 is a top plan view of the operational unit holder Figure 5 is a sectional view of the holder ofFigure 4, taken along the line V V Figure 6 is a view, taken in the same direction as Figure 5, with details shown partly in section for clarity of illustration Figure 7 is a view of this holder taken in the direction VII VII of Figure 6 and Figure 8 is a front view of this holder. Making reference to Figures 1 to 3, this holder comprises a base plate 1 adapted to be secured by means of bolts to a platform, not shown in the drawings. Welded to the plate 1 is an abutment 2 lying on a vertical plane and having an upper portion 3 substantially configured as an arc of a circle. Rigidly attached to a side face of the portion 3 is a guide 4 extending on a curved line, for example an arc of circle over more than a semicircle into a configuration, hereinafter called C like, with a dovetail cross section. Although not shown, the guide 4 could also have an elongate portion, for example at the middle of the C. To strengthen the abutment 2, welded to the opposite face thereof to that carrying the guide 4, are stiffening ribs 5 which connect the abutment 2 to a buttress 6 arranged, with respect to the abutment 2, to form an acute angle therewith. In practice, a columnar sector like structure which enables a number of such structures to be positioned concentrically around a working area where a rotary turret carrying the workpiece clamping vices is provided. Each workpiece is clamped in a respective vice such that the working area is located at the center of the guide 4. A holder, indicated as a whole at 7, may be positioned on the guide 4, for receiving an operational unit for carrying out a specific machining operation on the workpiece. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the holder 7 comprises a number of mutually movable and adjustable parts to permit the operational unit to be displaced with several degrees of freedom. In fact, the holder 7 comprises a first slide 8 including a rectilinear tenon 9 with dovetail cross section, normally whereto is a groove 10, also with dovetail cross section and a curvilinear pattern which is complementary to that of the guide 4. The lateral sides of the groove 10 are formed of two segments 11 and 12 the outer edges whereof have abutment pieces 13,14 arranged to abut against the opposed ends of the tenon 9. The segments 11,12 are fastened to the tenon 9 by two sets of screws, 15,16 and 17,18, each. By engaging the guide 4 in the groove 10, the slide 8 may be positioned to form a desired angle with a horizontal plane. The slide 8 is secured along the guide 4 by means of a set of pins 19 received in holes of the segments 11,12 and being adapted to project out of the segment 12 which defines the outer side of the groove 10 by the provision of respective set screws 20. By acting on the set screws 20, the pins 19 are pressed against the guide 4 which, accordingly, is locked against the opposite inner side of the groove 10. The tenon 9 of the slide 8 engages slidably in a seating 21 of complementary cross section which is formed in a second slide 22 by a pair of angle strips 23 and 24 secured to opposed edges of a plate 22a by means of double rows of screws, 25 and 26. A bore 27 is formed through the lower strip 24 Figures 5 and 7 for receiving a threaded rod 28 engaging a threaded portion of the bore 27. The rod 28 has a head 29 which is retained axially, but allowed to rotate freely in a lug of the slide 8. Rotation of the rod 28 causes the slide 22 to move along the tenon 9 of the slide 8, and hence relatively to the C like guide 4. The plate 22a has, on the opposite face to that adjoining the slide 8, a tenon 31 Figures 4 and 6 which extends orthogonally to the tenon 9. h bracket 32 of substantially squared configuration is guided on the tenon 31. The bracket 32 comprises a wall 33 which, at two opposed edges thereof, carries two strips 34,35 rigid to the bracket and defining a seating 36 for the sliding movement of the tenon 31. Formed at the middle of the wall 33 is a cylinder 37 Figure 5 of a hydraulic jack having its axis parallel to the tenon 31. Sealingly guided within the cylinder 37 is a piston 38 dividing the cylinder interior into two chambers 39,40 which are connected to a hydraulic system. The piston 38 is held stationary relatively to the slide 22 by a peg 41, the opposed ends whereof are inserted into the plate 22a andthe piston38,respectively. The peg 41 is passed through a slot 42 in the cylinder, having a major dimension in the jack axial direction. It may be appreciated from the foregoing that, when a pressurized fluid is delivered into either of the two chambers 39,40, and owing to the piston 38 being held stationary relatively to the slide 22, the bracket 32 will be caused to move along the tenon 31. To adjust the travel distance of the bracket 32 along the tenon 31, two travel limit stops are provided which comprise two threaded tangs 43s44 Figures4,6and 8 and are threaded into ribs external to the cylinder 37 in aligned relationship. Interposed between the juxtaposed ends of the tangs 43,44 is a roller 45 mounted to one end of a pin 46 which protrudes radially out of the piston 38 and is offset angularly by 900 with respect to the peg 41. The pin 46 is passed through the wall of the cylinder 37 at a further slot, not shown in the drawings but quite similar to the slot 42 which allows the peg 41 to stand out of the cylinder. The bracket 32 comprises a surface 47 extending perpendicularly to the wall 33 and accommodating aeylin der 48 of a further hydraulic aok having its axis orthogonal to the cylinder 37. Slidable in sealed relationship within the cylinder 48 is a piston 49 which defines two chambers 50,51 connected to the hydraulic system. Radially rigid with the piston 49 is a peg 52 which projects from the cylinder 48 upwards through an elongate slot 53 in the direction of the jack axis Figure 5 . Also rigidly attached to the piston 49 is a pin 54 which is located angularly 900 away from the peg 52 and projects outwards through a further slot in the cylinder 48. Mounted on the outward end of the pin 54 is a roller 55 which can move between two travel limit stops 56,57 Figure 6 formed of two threaded tangs which are threaded into outer ribs on the cylinder 48. In practice, therefore, travel between piston 49 and cylinder 48 is controlled in exactly the same way as described hereinabove in connection with references 41 46. The peg 52 is inserted from below through a carriage 58 having the operational unit, not shown, mounted thereon. The carriage 58 has a dovetail cross section groove 59 Figure 8 for sliding engagement with a tenon 60 attached to the cylinder 48, spaced apart from the surface 47 and extending, of course, in the direction of the cylinder axis. The carriage 58 would be equipped to fit the characteristics of the operational unit. In the embodiment shown, for example, a circular guide 61 Figure 4 is provided to permit the operational unit to be rotated on the carriage 58 to an angularly adjustable position relatively to the C like guide 4. The device just described operates as follows. After placing the operational unit onto the carriage 58, its po sition relatively to a workpiece is adjusted in aceordance withtfie intended machining operation.The sequence of effectuation of the adjustments will be selected contingent on requirements. As an example, one may first adJust the orientation of the operational unit by changing the angular position of the holder 7 along the guide 4. To this aim, after loosening the pins 19 Figure 4 , the holder is moved along the C like guide 4 up to the desired angle, thereafter the pins 19 are again secured. In order to move the operational unit from and to the workpiece, the threaded rod 28 is operated to displace the slide 22 slidably along the tenon 9. To prevent the stresses imposed on the operational unit from being transferred onto the threaded rod 28, it is contemplated that the tenon 9 be locked in the groove 21by means of additional pins 62 see Figure 6 which are guided in holes provided through the strips 23,24 and tightened against the sides of the tenon 9 by set screws 63. On completion of the above preliminary steps for positioning and orienting the operational unit relatively to the workpiece, the operations involved in adjusting the lengths of the machining travel distances are completed. In fact, as mentioned in the preamble, the operational unit is required to execute machining operations along x , y and z axes of movement. In view of the means for moving a tool toward and into the workpiece being usually incorporated to the operational unit, any machining operations which require the tool to be shifted sideways are carried out by actuating the hydraulic jacks 37 38 and 48 49. Actuation of the jack 37 38 will thus produce a displacement of the bracket 32 along the tenon 31, whereas the actuation of the jack 48 49 will produce a displacement of the carriage 58 along the tenon 60.The length of such displacement movements is set by adjusting the travel limit stops 43 44 and 56 57 it may be appreciated that adjustment of the travel limit stops will be related to a specific machining operation to be performed on the workpiece. As may be seen, the foregoing device affords a number of advantages. In particular, the C like configuration of the guide 4 allows the operational unit to be oriented conveniently in order to be able to machine the workpiece both from above and below. From a constructional standpoint, the expedient of incorporating the cylinders 37 and 48 to the structure of the bracket 32 has proved advantageous,In fact, this has allowed a more compact construction for the holder, while significantly decreasing the space requirements of the transfer line and affording advanced automation. A modified embodiment of the invention provides an additional slide, associated with the slide 22 and effective to ensure a higher order of freedom for adjusting the bracket relatively to the C like guide.
