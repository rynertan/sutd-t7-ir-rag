# Radio communication receiver having a low power consumption oscillator circuit.

## Abstract
A radio communication receiver for demodulating re ceived signals includes a decoder 35 for decoding the demodulated signals an oscillator 70 connected to the decoder 35 for generating a reference timing signal first and second power sources 60 23 having first and second voltages the second voltage being higher than the first voltage a power switch 80 connected to the first and second power sources 60 23 and means 22 for supplying the first voltage to the oscillator in response to the turning on of the power switch 80 and automatically supplying the second voltage to the oscillator in response to the turning off of the power switch 80 .
