# CERAMIC SINTERED BODY

## Abstract
A ceramic sintered body comprises a first material comprising at least one of precursor and metastable material of the final sintered body and a second material derived from the first material and serving as additive to be added to the first material by 0.1 to 100 on particle number basis. The ceramic sintered body is sintered in a process which comprises the steps of providing a first material which comprises at least one of precursor and metastable material of the final sintered body, adding a second material and sintering mixture of the first and second materials.
