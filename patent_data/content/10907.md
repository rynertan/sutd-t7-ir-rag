# Semiconductor memory device including a flip flop circuit.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device includes a flip flop circuit acting as a sense amplifier 31, 32, ..., 3N , first 11, 12, ..., 1N and second 21, 22, ..., 2N bit lines connected to the flip flop circuit, the potential applied to the second bit line being opposite to that applied to the first bit line, and first and second data bus lines crossing the first and the second bit lines 51 and 52 , respectively. In addition, first and second dummy lines 61 and 62 are arranged parallel with the first and the second data bus lines 51 and 52 respectively, in order to prevent an erroneous ope ration of an I O amplifier 4 connected to the first and the second data bus lines 51 and 52 by noise generated in these lines.
