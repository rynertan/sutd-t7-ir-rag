# A process for producing a crosslinkable copolymer of a lactone and a polyfunctional acrylate, the so obtained copolymer, a method for the manufacture of articles therefrom and the so formed articles.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic, crosslinkable copolymer is produced by reacting an active hydrogen containing initiator with a lactone monomer, such as epsilon caprolactone, and a polyfunctional acrylate, such as neopentyl glycol diacrylate. The copolymer can be crosslinked by exposure to ionizing or actinic radiation or by free radical peroxide catalysts. The degree of crosslinking can be controlled to produce a material which is thermoplastically processable and displays modified rheological properties which make it more easily processable than the corresponding lactone homopolymer.
