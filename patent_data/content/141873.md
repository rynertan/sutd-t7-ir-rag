The phenoxy nitrobenzoate reactants can be prepared according to the process of copending applications Serial No. 358,974, filed March 17, 1982 and Serial No. 239,286, filed March 2, 1981. The mole ratio of said benzoate to sulfamoyl chloride can vary between about 1 1 and about 1 10. Although stoichiometric amounts are most desirable for the reaction, excess sulfamoyl chloride can serve as a recyclable solvent for the system.While other diluent can be employed if desired such as pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, triethylamine and mixtures thereof, it is to be understood that the reaction can also be carried out in the absence of a diluent. When a solvent is employed, the concentration of the reactant benzoate can vary between about 10 wt. Gó and about 80 wt. 9ó The product of the reaction is recovered by conventional means such es stripping, distillation or precipitation. The compounds of this invention are useful both as pre emergent and post emergent herbicides and are highly selective to crops. Among the crops on which these herbicides may be advantageously employed, are, for example, grainineae including rice, cereal crops, sorghum, corn, wheat and safflower leguminosae including bearers, peas, peanuts, soybeans and lentiles solanaeeae including potato, pepper, tobacco and tomato curciferae including cabbages and turnips malvaceae including cotton umbelliferae including carrots and parsley and Liliaceae including onion, scallion, and shallot.Cheet grass, foxtail, barnyard grass, curled dock, yellow rocket, chickwecd, pigweed, lambsquarter, morning glory, Japanese millet, crabgrass, ragweed, cocklebur, velvet leaf, coffee weed, wild mtistard and black mustard are among the weed species controlled by the prcsent herbicides. Accordingly, the novel substituted diphenyl ethers of this invention are broad spectrum herbicides. The herbicides of this invention may be applied in any amount which will give the required control of weeds depending on the type of weed and degree of infestation. A preferred rate of application of the bcnzoales is from 0.05 to 8 Ibs. per acre. In practical application, the compounds may be applied in solid, liquid or in vaporized form, or, as it is generally done, as an active ingredient in a standard herbicidal composition or formulation which comprises a carrier. A generally accepted carrier is a substance which can be used to dissolve, disperse or diffuse the herbicidal components in the composition. Non limiting examples of liquid carriers include watery organic solvents such as alcohols, ketones, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ether , amides, esters, nitriles, mineral oils, pal in oil and the like Non limiting examp es of solid carriers include Kaolin, bentonite, tale1 diatomaceous earth, vermiculite, clay, gypsum, grain and seed hulls, ground corn cobs and the like. Th addition to a carrier, it is usually desirable to add to the herbicidal formulation additives such as emulsifying agents, wetting agents, binding agents, stabilizer and the like or thickeners as desired for particular weather conditions or applications. The compounds may be formulated, for example, as a dust. wettable powders, paste, emulsifiable concentrates, granular formulations or as liquids or aerosols. The phenoxybenzoates of this invention may be applied along with plant growth regulators, insecticides, fungicides, nematocides and fertilizers.They may be applied in combination with one or more other herbicides.Non limiting examples of other herbicides which can be incorporated with the pbenoxybenzoates of this invention are anilides, such as N methoxymethyl 2,6diethylphenyl chloroacetamide dinitroanilines, such as alpha , alpha , alpha trifluoro 2,6 dinitro N,N di propyl p toluidine carboxylic acids and derivatives triazi nes substituted urcas carba mates thiocarbamstes uracils heterocycles and organo phosphorous compounds.
