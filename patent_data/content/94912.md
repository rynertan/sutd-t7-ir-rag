# Improved laser shock processing.

## Abstract
An improved method and an apparatus for altering properties in a solid target by using the radiation emitted by a high power pulsed laser to generate a short duration, high amplitude pressure pulse is directed at the front side of solid target to alter material properties. The front side of the solid target is covered with an overlay material that is transparent to laser light, and the back side is placed in direct contact with a trapping material having substantially the same acoustical impedance as the metal substrate. When the solid target is processed by the pulsed laser, the microstructure and the stress state of the target are altered in a predictable manner.
