# Drainage tube.

## Abstract
Subsoil drain strip or blanket comprising a core 2 surrounded by a polymer or glass fibre filter cloth 1 . The core 2 has a generally planar configuration with formed in projections 20 on one or both sides which create internal volume for flow of water as well as supporting the filter cloth 1 against imposed soil loads. The length of the supporting projections on each side of the core is to be greater than one quarter of their closest spacing so that adequate longitudinal flow of water can take place in the strip without the need for additional drainage tubes to be provided.
