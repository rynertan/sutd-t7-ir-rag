# A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF SHAPED ARTICLES OF A VINYL CHLORIDE BASED RESIN HAVING IMPROVED SURFACE PROPERTIES

## Abstract
A vinyl chloride based resin is compounded with a filler, e.g. calcium carbonate, having been treated on the surface with an epoxy compound such as 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxy silane in advance and the resin composition is shaped into an article which is then subjected to a low temperature plasma treatment. The thus obtained shaped article is imparted with remarkably improved surface prop erties such as decrease in the phenomenon of plasticizer bleeding and the effect is very durable even after prolonged outdoor exposure of the article.
