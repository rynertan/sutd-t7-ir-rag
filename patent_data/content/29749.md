# Voltage dependent resistor and method of making same.

## Abstract
A voltage dependent resistor for a lightening arrester and a surge absorber comprises a sintered zinc oxide body of a composition which comprises, as additives, 0.1 to 3.0 mole percent of bismuth oxide Bi₂O₃ , 0.1 to 3 mole percent of cobalt oxide Co₂O₃ , 0.1 to 3 mole percent of maganese oxide MnO₂ , 0.1 to 3.0 mole percent of antimony oxide Sb₂O₃ , 0.05 to 1.5 mole percent of chromium oxide Cr₂O₃ , at least one member selected from the group con sisting of 0.1 to 10 mole percent of silicon oxide SiO₂ and 0.1 to 3 mole percent of nickel oxide NiO , at least one member selected from the group consisting of 0.0005 to 0.025 mole percent of aluminum oxide Al₂O₃ and 0.005 to 0.025 mole percent of gallium oxide Ga₂O₃ , and 0.005 to 0.3 mole percent of boron oxide B₂O₃ , and if necessary, 0.00005 to 0.3 mole percent of silver oxide Ag₂O , with elec trodes applied to opposite surfaces of the sintered body. The resistor has a non ohmic property voltage dependent property due to the bulk itself. Therefore, its C value can be changed without impairing its n value by changing the dis tance between the electrodes at opposite surfaces.
