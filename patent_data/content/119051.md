## Description
A METHOD OF COATING A SUBSTRATE, A COATING COMPOSITION AND A COATED ARTICLE The field of the invention is methods of applying flexible coatings to substrates, coating compositions used, and coated articles. More particularly, the invention is concerned with the curing of thermosetting epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymers and aminoplast cross linking agents based coating compositions on flexible as well as rigid substrates such as automotive vehicle exteriors. Changes in the automotive industry have resulted in the use of many new materials in the manufacturing of automobile parts. The properties of these materials place new demands on the coating compositions used to protect them and make them aesthetically appealing. Automobiles of the 1980 s have some flexible plastic parts in the areas of the front and rear bumpers to prevent damage from minor bumps. These parts require paints that are extremely flexible over a wide range of temperatures, durable to weathering, and aesthetically pleasing.The prior art coating compositions for these flexible parts are based upon high molecular weight polyester urethane polymers cured with aminoplast resins. These thermoset polyester urethanes exhibit excellent initial flexibility, but the flexibility deteriorates rapidly when the coated article is exposed to even normal weathering. Because the most suitable polyesterurethanes are very high in molecular weight, these polymers are unsuitable for high solids, solvent borne coatings The state of the art of these polyester urethane polymers is illustrated by the DURETRANE Trade Mark coating compositions of PPG as illustrated in their Information Bulletins for DEL32 906, and DEM 32 797. The state of the art of epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymers and aminoplast cross linking agent based coating compositions may be ascertained by reference to U.S.Patent Specification No. 4,082,816, of Fisk et al, the article byB.E. Bailey et al entitled Caprolactone in Surface Coatings , as reported in the Journal of the Oil Colour ChemistryAssociation 1981 , Volume 64, at pages 398 404, the article byA. Schindler et al entitled Alcohol Initiated Polymerization of Epsilon Caprolactone in the Journal of Polymer Science Polymer Chemistry Edition, Volume 20 1982 at pages 319 326, and the article by A.N. Theodore et al entitled Modification ofAcrylic Polymers etc. in the Journal of Coatings Technology,Volume 54, No. 693, 10 82, pages 77 81. Acrylic microgel resins are useful in the present invention and the state of this technology may be ascertained by reference to U.S. Patent Specification Nos. 4,220,679 4,290,932, and 4,340,511. Having in mind the limitations of the prior art the present invention seeks to provide flexible coatings for rigid and flexible substrates as used on the exterior surfaces of automobile bodies. Another object of the invention is the compositions required to provide the flexible coatings. Still another object of the present invention is the multiple coating of flexible and rigid substrates with clear coats wet on wet over the flexible coatings. Yet another object of the present invention is primers for the flexible and rigid substrates over which the multiple flexible coatings are applied. A further object of the present invention is the coating of flexible and rigid substrates with a conductive primer followed by application of the flexible multiple coatings. These objects of the present invention are achieved by the use of coating compositions where thermosetting solution acrylic resins are modified with epsilon caprolactone to get high solids caprolactone modified acrylic polymers. The caprolactone modified acrylic polymers are then mixed with appropriate aminoplast resins, pigments, solvents, additives, and acid catalysts to make high solids coating compositions. The following coating compositions are prepared a metallic paint compositions b straight shade paint compositions without metal pigments c basecoat paint compositions d unpigmented clear coat paint compositions to be applied wet on wet over the basecoats e conductive primers and f non conductive primers. These paint compositions produce flexible coatings for use over the exterior plastic and metal parts of automobile bodies. The coatings are spray painted with standard types of application equipment and are baked at standard automobile bake temperatures.Description of the Preferred Embodiments The use of these thermosetting epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymers of the present invention offers a means of obtaining coatings having improved solids content and durability characteristics. Moreover, the present invention provides a novel pigmented coating composition for flexible as well as rigid automobile body parts. The flexible parts can be coated with the same base coat as the entire rigid exterior of the automobile body. Before baking, a flexible clear coating can be applied to the flexible parts and a rigid clear coating can be applied to the rigid parts. Previously known flexible basecoat compositions and flexible clearcoat compositions were not compatible with the rigid clearcoat compositions. This complication required one of several special processing techniques.The prior art required that different basecoat compositions be used for the rigid and flexible parts.To prevent the intermixing of spray droplets, these parts would be sprayed in separate locations. The rigid parts and the flexible parts could then be clearcoated wet on wet with rigid and flexible clears respectively. Since different basecoat compositions are used in different locations in the prior art, it is very difficult to get good clear matches. Another option of the prior art is that the same basecoat composition could be used for the rigid as well as the flexible parts, but since the clearcoat compositions are not compatible, the parts still must be clearcoated separately. The flexible coatings of the present invention can be spray painted adjacent to normal rigid acrylic melamine clearcoats by employing commonly known paint formulating techniques. A specially formulated clear for the flexible parts and a specially formulated clear for the rigid parts will give the optimum paint performance for both areas of the vehicle. On the other hand, it is possible to formulate a coating with epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymers that has enough flexibility for the flexible parts and still be an excellent coating for the rigid parts. This would allow the automotive manufacturer much greater freedom when painting the car body. Fewer paints would be required in the factory and a reduced number of spray stations and equipment would be required to apply the coating. Moreover, the present invention provides novel coatings for substrates which upon curing provide improved flexibility over flexible substrates after exposure to weathering. Another unique advantage of the epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic resins of the present invention is that high solids coating com positions can be made without any significant loss of durability. The thermosetting coating compositions of the present invention are prepared from an epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymer, an aminoplast cross linking polymer1 volatile organic solvents, and in some instances, a cellulose acetate butyrate resin, an acid catalyst, a microgel resin, U. V.absorbers, and uniformly dispersed pigments. The preferred method of depositing the film is by utilizing spraying tech piques The basic binder system is pigmented and made into several types of coatings. Optionally, metallic pigments, such as aluminum, copper, bronze, and the like, can be added in such quantities along with other conventional opaque and transparent pigments that a metallic or straight shade color effect is obtained. The coating compositions are applied normally in a dry film thickness of 0.8 to 2.2 mils. However, the levels of pigment can be adjusted so that a basecoat, dry film thickness of 0.4 to 1.5 mils, is applied. A clear coating of 0.8 to 2.5 mils can then be used over the basecoat. The pigmentation can be selected so that a primer coating can be produced. By controlling the pigmentation with additions of conductive pigments, the dry film can be either conductive or non conductive These coated substrates, after a short flash of 1 to 5 minutes, are baked at between about 820 C 1930 C for an appropriate amount of time to get a hardened coating, usually 20 to 40 minutes. Coatings based upon these epsiloncaprolactone polymers require considerably shorter flash times than current polyester urethanes before baking. The epsilon caprolactone polymer based coatings also tolerate a wider baking temperature range before a deterioration in flexibility and weathering test results is observed. Another important unexpected advantage of the coating compositions based upon the epsilon caprolactone modified acrylics of the present invention is the good adhesion obtained when the particles are repaired or recoated. Current polyester urethane aminoplastic cured coated articles require sanding before they can be recoated or poor intercoat adhesion is obtained. Articles coated with the epsilon caprolactone based compositions of the present invention require no special preparation before a repair coat is applied. These flexible coating compositions of the present invention have binders or film forming solid constituents of at least 35 by weight. Generally, the composition has a film forming solids content of about 35 68 at application viscosity. The remainder of the constituents in the composition is a liquid carrier which generally is a solvent for the binder.In addition, the composition optionally contains about 0.5 1508 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of pigment. The binders or film forming constituents used in the coating compositions comprise about 40 95 by weight of an epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymer and about 5 45 by weight of an aminoplast resin cross linking agent. For most uses, the composition contains about 65 75 by weight of epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymer and 25 35 by weight of aminoplast resin cross linking agent. In addition, the composition optionally contains 0.5 35 by weight of an acrylic microgel resin and optionally 1.0 to 10 of a cellulose acetate butyrate resin. The epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymer can be prepared by a variety of solution polymerization methods in which the monomers are blended with a solvent, optionally a free radical polymerization catalyst, optionally epsilon caprolactone optionally epsilon caprolactone modified monomer, optionally a polymerization catalyst for the epsilon caprolactone, and optionally a chain transfer agen and heated to 750 to 165O C for two to eight hours to form a polymer. When the epsiloncaprolactone is not included in this process, it is added to the preformed acrylic polymer along with an optional polymerization catalyst for the epsilon caprolactone and heated to 750 to 1650 C for 2 to 8 hours to form a polymer.These epsiloncaprolactone modified polymers have number average molecular weights from about 1,000 to 6,000, hydroxyl contents from about 1 to 7 by weight, optionally carboxyl contents from about 0.1 to 4a08 by weight, and epsilon caprolactone mols of about 0.25 to 6 per mole to hydroxy and or carboxyl in the mixture being polymerized. SOLVENTS Typical solvents which are used to prepare the epsiloncaprolactone modified acrylic polymer are the following toluene, ethyl acetate, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, mineral spirits, ethylene glycol monoether acetates and other aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, ketones, and other compatible solvents are conveniently used. Special care is exercised when functional solvents are desired. Acid, alcohol and amine functional solvents have the potential of reacting with epsilon caprolactone, and therefore should not be introduced until the epsilon caprolactone has been reacted with the desired site on the acrylic polymer. MONOMERS The epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymer is composed of epsilon caprolactone and at least two types of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. A portion of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer structure contains a carboxyl and or hydroxyl group or other group containing an active hydrogen capable of reacting with the epsilon caprolactone monomer.Examples of such hydroxyl containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers are hydroxyalkyl acrylates and hydroxyalkyl methacry lates such as 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 3hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and 4 hydroxybutyl methacrylate. Examples of such carboxyl containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and crotonic acid. Typically, the remainder of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing no carboxyl, hydroxyl groups or other active hydrogen groups, are alkyl methacrylates and acrylates such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, nonyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, nonyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, isodecyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, phenyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate and the like, or other constituents such as styrene or substituted styrene, such as methyl styrene, acrylonitrile, and methacrylonitrile. The preferred concentrations of the monomeric materials of the present invention in parts by weight are as follows Xy Weight Preferred Much PreferredCarboxyl functional monomers 0.2 9 0.2 4Hydroxyl functional monomers 1.0 48 10 30Other monomers The reminder The remainderNot having hydroxyl or carboxyl groups 25 85 25 75 Epsilon Caprolactone monomer 5 55 15 50 FREE RADICAL INITIATOR The polymerization is preferably carried out in the presence of a free radical polymerization catalyst, typically, tertiary butyl perbenzoate, tertiary butyl peroctoate, cumene hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, di tertiary butylperoxide, di cumene peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide or similar peroxygen compounds, or an azo compound such as azobisisobutyronitrile is employed.The amount of free radical polymerization catalyst can be varied depending upon the desired molecular weight but about 1 to 6 by weight is typical.A mixture of two or more initiators may be used. EPSILON CAPROLACTONE CATALYST In addition to the free radical polymerization catalyst, the polymerization medium could include a polymerization catalyst when epsilon caprolactone monomer is used in the composition. Typically this epsilon caprolactone catalyst may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal alkoxide, e.g. sodium or calcium methoxide aluminum isopropoxide, tetraalkyl titanates, titanium chelates and acylates, lead salts and lead oxides, zinc borate, antimony oxide, stannous octoate, organic acids, inorganic acids such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, and phosphoric, and Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride. CHAIN TRANSFER AGENT Optionally, a chain transfer agent is used to control the length of the epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymer backbone. The most typical chain transfer agents are sulfur compounds such as dodecyl mercaptan, 2 mercapto ethanol, butyl mercaptan n octyl mercaptan, and the like.The chain transfer agent is used at about .5 to 6 level by weight on solid polymer. POLYMERIZATION METHODS The polymerization may be carried out in a conventional manner, utilizing heat and or catalysts and varying solvents and techniques. Several different processing methods can be used to prepare epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic polymers. The main differences involve the specific point where the epsiloncaprolactone is introduced into the reaction process. In one method, the epsilon caprolactone is charged to the reactor along with the organic solvents. These materials are heated to reaction temperature and the ethylenically unsaturated monomers are added and reacted in the presence of the solvent and the epsilon caprolactone. When the catalyst for the polymerization of the epsilon caprolactone is added after the ethylenically unsaturated monomers have been added to the flask, then much of the epsilon caprolactone merely functions as a solvent during the free radical polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers. This process leads to extremely low viscosity epsilon caprolactone modified acrylic resins, suitable for high solids type coating compositions. An optional polymerization method is that described in detail in Examples 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, of U. S. Patent No.4,082,816. The epsilon caprolactone is added to the reaction vessel along with the ethylenically unsaturated monomers.Even in this process, the epsilon caprolactone functions as a solvent when it doesn t instantaneously react with the hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. The rate at which epsilon caprolactone reacts can be controlled by temperature and catalyst. Another common method of incorporating the epsiloncaprolactone is to add the ethylenically unsaturated monomers to the reaction vessel and essentially complete the free radical initiated portion of the polymerization before the epsiloncaprolactone is introduced. This method is described in Example 3 of U. S. Patent No. 4,082,816. Still another polymerization method useful in the present invention is to pre react epsilon caprolactone with the carboxyl or hydroxyl functional ethylenically unsaturated monomer to form a new difunctional monomer with an ethylenically unsaturated double bond and a pendant hydroxyl or carboxyl group. The molar ratio of epsilon caprolactone to ethylenically unsaturated carboxyl or hydroxyl monomer can range from 0.1 to 20 but more preferably from 0.25 to 6 A typical example of such a monomer is TONE M 100 , a product of Union Carbide which is a reaction product of one mole of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate with 2 moles of epsilon caprolactone. This acrylate epsilon caprolactone kind of special epsiloncaprolactone extended ethylenically unsaturated monomer can be substituted for the epsilon caprolactone monomer and the appropriate hydroxyl or carboxyl functional monomer in the polymer composition. In this polymerization method as well as the method where the epsilon caprolactone is added after the free radical polymerization, the epsilon caprolactone doesn t function as a solvent for the free radical polymerization, therefore, with all other factors equal these procedures produce somewhat higher molecular weight polymer. AMINOPLAST The aminoplast resins used as cross linkers for the polymer are aldehyde condensation products of melamine, urea, benzoguanamine, or a similar compound. They may be watersoluble or they may be organic solvent soluble. Generally, the aldehyde employed is formaldehyde, although useful products can be made from other aldehydes, such as acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, acrolein, benzaldehyde, furfural, and others.Condensation products of melamine or urea are the most common and are preferred, but products of other amines and amides in which at least one amine group is present can also be employed. For example, such condensation products can be produced from triazines, diazines, triazoles, guanidines, guanamines, and alkyl and aryl substituted derivatives of such compounds, including alkyl substituted, aryl substituted and cyclic ureas, and alkyl and aryl substituted melamines. Some examples of such compounds are N,N dimethyl urea, benzylurea, N,N ethyleneurea, diazine, diamide, formoguanamine, benzoguanamine, ammeline, 2 chloro 4, 6 diamino 1,3 ,5 triazine, 3 ,5 diaminotriazole, 4,6 diaminopyrimidine, 2,4,6 triphenyltriamino 1,3,5 triazine, and the like. These aldehyde condensation products contain methylol groups or similar alkylol groups, depending upon the particular aldehyde employed. If desired, these methylol groups can be etherified by reaction with an alcohol. Various alcohols are employed for this purpose, including essentially a monohydric alcohol, although the preferred alcohols are methanol, butanol, and similar lower alkanols. The resin can be monomeric or polymeric. One preferred resin which gives a high quality finish is hexamethoxymethyl melamine, especially for high solids paints. One typical resin of the preferred type is Cymel 303.Another useful resin is a methoxy butoxymethyl melamine. CELLULOSE ACETATE BUTYRATE Optionally, in addition to the above film forming constituents, about 1 10 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents of the composition, of cellulose acetate butyrate can be used in the composition. Cellulose acetate butyrate that has a butyryl content of about 25 60 by weight and a viscosity of about 0.01 2 seconds measured according to ASTM D 1343 56at 250 C. can be utilized. MICROGEL Another useful type of film forming polymer that can be used in the coating compositions of the present invention is an acrylic microgel. These can be prepared by methods outlined in U. S. Patent No. 4,290,932. Typically, these microgels are prepared by polymerizing a mixture of ethylenically unsaturated monomers at least one of which is difunctional in ethylenic type unsaturation, and at least one of which contains a polar group for example a carboxy or hydroxy group in an aqueous emulsion. The microparticles so prepared then are transferred into the non polar organic medium of the coating composition. Care must be taken to prevent the polar groups from re orienting themselves in the microparticle inner part, as in such an eventuality the microparticles become ineffective in the sense of the present invention. A high degree of cross linking of the particles by means of polyfunctional monomers prevents this re orientation of the polar groups when transferring the microparticles into an organic, non polar medium whereby polar groups are also present in the coating composition on the surface of the microparticles. Because of the polar groups, there are interactions between the microparticles and a spatial lattice is formed.The interactions for instance may be due to dipole dipole forces or hydrogen bridge bonds. Due to the interactions, a loose spatial lattice is formed between the particles in the coating substance, which can be reversibly dismantled by shearing forces. The loose lattice, i.e., a gel structure, renders the coating composition structurally viscous or thixotropic.These microparticles unexpectedly prevent pigment settling, improve pattern control, help obtain good film builds and greatly reduce the sagging tendency of high solids type compositions which are based on low molecular weight resins. The e microgel particles may be merely added to the ther mosetting composition without the need for elaborate conditions.In a preferred embodiment, the microgel particles are added to the polymer solution by merely blending the non aqueous dispersion in which the microgel particles are formed with the solution. ACID CATALYST An acid catalyst solution can be added to the composition to increase the rate of cross linking of the composition on curing. Generally, about 0.1 3 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents, of acid catalyst is used. For example, phosphoric acid or an alkyl acid phosphate can be utilized for this purpose. Typical alkyl acid phosphates are methyl acid phosphate, ethyl acid phosphate, propyl acid phosphate, lauryl acid phosphate, butyl acid phosphate, phenyl acid phosphate, 2 ethyl hexyl acid phosphate, and the like. Sulfonic acid or a substituted sulfonic acid can be used such as para toluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalene disulfonic acid, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and the like. Maleic acid or alkyl acid maleates can be used such as butyl acid maleate, ethyl acid maleate, and the like. Additionally, the catalytic action may be supplied by the incorporation of free acid groups in the film forming polymer, for example, by the use of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid as a comonomer in the preparation of an acrylic polymer. BLOCKED ACID CATALYST The acid catalysts used in the present invention may be blocked with amines, or epoxies so as to improve the shelf stability of the completed paint formula. Amines such as triethylamine, diethylamine, diethylethanol amines, pyridine and the like may be used. Epoxies such as glycidyl ester of versatic acid and Epon 828 , a trademark of Shell, and the like may be used. These blocking agents neutralize the acid until the baking process takes place. At that time, the blocking agent is released and the acid functions as a catalyst to the cross linking reaction. U.V. STABILIZER To protect the coated article from premature degradation due to the U.V. light portion of sun light about 0.5 5 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming material, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer is used in topcoat formulations. Typical ultraviolet light stabilizers that are useful in this invention are as follows Benzophenones such as dodecyl oxibenzophenone, 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone, hydroxybenzophenones containing sulfonic groups, 2, 4 dihydroxy 3 ,5 ditertiary butyl benzophenone, 2,2 ,4 trihydroxy benzophenone esters of dicarboxylic acids, 2 hydroxy 4 acryloxyethoxybenzophenone, aliphatic mono esters of 2,2 , 4 trihydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone 2 hydroxy 4methoxy 2 carboxybenzophenone.

Triazines such as 3,5 dialkyl 4 hydroxyphenyl derivatives of triazine, sulfur containing derivatives of diallyl 4hydroxy phenyl triazines, hydroxy phenyl 1,3,5 triazine and such triazines containing sulfonic acid groups, aryl 1,3,5 triazines, orthohydroxyl aryl s triazone. Benzoates such as dibenzoate of diphenylol propane, tertiary butyl benzoate of diphenylol propane, nonyl phenyl benzoate, octyl phenyl benzoate, resorcinol dibenzoate. Other ultraviolet light stabilizers include lower alkyl thiomethylene containing phenols, substituted benzenes such as 1,3 bis 2 hydroxybenzoyl benzene, metal derivatives of 3,5di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl proprionic acid, asymmetrical oxalic acid diarylamides, alkylhydroxyphenyl thioalkanoic acid esters, dialkylhydroxyphenyl alkanoic acid esters of di and tri pentaerythritol, phenyl and naphthalene substituted oxalic acid diamides, methyl beta 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl proprionate, O , bis 2 hydroxyphenol di isopropyl benzenes, 3,5 dibromo 2 hydroxy acetophenone, ester derivatives of 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentanoic acid wherein there is at least one unsubstituted position ortho to the aromatic hydroxyl groups, organophosphorus sulfides such as bis diphenyl phosphinothioyl monosulfide and bistdiphenyl phosphinothioylXdisulfide, 4benzoyl 6 dialkyl hydroxy benzyl resorcinol, bis 3 hydroxy 4 benzoyl phenoxy diphenyl silane, bis 3 hydroxy 4 benzoylphen oxy dialkyl silane, 1,8 naphthalimides, i cyano, ,ss diphenylacrylic acid derivatives, bis 2 benzoxazolyl alkanes, bis 2 naphthoxazolyl alkanes, methylene malonitriles containing aryl and heterocyclic substitutes, alkylene bis dithiocarbanate, 4 benzoyl 3 hydroxy phenoxyethyl acrylate, 4 benzoyl3 hydroxyphenoxy ethyl methacrylate, aryl or alkyl substituted acrylonitriles, 3 methyl 5 isopropylphenyl 6 hydroxy coumarone. In addition to the U.V. stabilizer, hindered amine light stabilizers and antioxidants can be used. The U.V. stabilizer molecules are designed to absorb the U.V. light and dissipate the energy whereas. the hindered amine light stabilizer and the antioxidants are designed to terminate free radicals which have been generated in the paint films by the U.V. light. The termination of the free radicals limits the amount of film degradation that takes place. Typical antioxidants are as follows tetrakis alkylene di alkyl hydroxy aryl alkyl ester alkanes such as tetrakis methylene 3 3 ,5 dibutyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane, reaction product of p amino diphenylamine and glycidyl methacrylate, reaction product of n hexyl N phenyl p phenylene diamine and glycidyl methacrylate, pentaerythritol tetrakis thioglycolate , trimethylol propane tris thioglycolate , trimethylol ethane tris thioglycoate , N 4 anilino phenyl acrylamide, N 4 anilinophenyl meleamic acid N 4 anilinophenyl maleimide, alkylhydroxyphenyl groups bonded through carboalkoxy linkages to nitrogen atom of a heterocyclic nucleus containing an imidodicarbonyl group or an inidodithiocarbonyl group, 3,5di tert. butyl 4 hydroxy cinnamonitrile, ethyl 3,5 di tert.hexyl 4 hydroxycinnamide, substituted benzyl esters of ss substituted hydroxy phenyl propionic acids, bis hydroxyphenyl alkylene alkyl isocyanurate compounds, tetrakis hydroxy benzyl phosphonium halides alone or in combination with a dialkylthiodialkanoate, thiodimethylidyne tetrakisphenols alone or in combination with a dialkyl thiodialkanoate or phosphite or phosphonate, dihydrocarbyl hydroxy phenyl aryl or alkyl phosphonites or phosphonates or phosphates or phosphites or phosphinates or phosphinites or phosphorothionates or phosphinothionates, diphenyl bis 3,5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxy phenoxy silane, hydrocarbyl hydroxyphenyl dihydrocarbyldithiocarbamates such as 3,5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl dimethyldithio carbamate and amino benzyl thioether. PIGMENTS The compositions of the present invention frequently contain pigments which improve the protective and decorative effect of the coatings. The term pigment herein means colored and hueless,.organic and inorganic pigments, filler or dyestuffs which are soluble or insoluble in solvents or vehicles.Especially as regards automobile enameling, metallic pigments have for some time been widely used. Metallic pigments offer a varying reflection on incident light as a function of the angle of observation. This effect is frequently called the wFlip Flop effect and depends on the orientation of the flake like metallic pigments in the finished coating. The pigment particles included in the compositions may range in size from about 0.1 to 100 microns and may be of any of the pigments conventionally used in surface coating compositions, including inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide, iron oxide, chromium oxide, lead chromate and carbon black and organic pigments such as phthalocyanine blue and phthalocyanine green, carbazole violet, anthrapyrimidine yellow, flavanthrone yellow, isoindoline yellow, indanthrone blue, quinacridone violet and perylene reds. For the present purposes, the term pigment is here meant to embrace also conventional fillers and extenders, such as talc or kaolin. Suitable metallic pigments include in particular aluminum flake and copper bronze flake, which are intended for the production of glamour metallic finishes. In genexal, pigments of any kind may be incorporated in compositions in an amount of from about 0.58 to 150 of the aggregate weight of the film forming polymer and the micropar tides. Where metallic pigmentation is employed, this is preferably in an amount of from 2 to 20 by weight of the aforesaid aggregate weight. Electrically conductive pigments range from about 10 to 40 by weight. Such pigments, whether metallic or otherwise, may be incorporated into the compositions with the aid of known dispersants. Thus, the main film forming polymer may be employed as pigment dispersant. Any such polymeric dispersant is also considered to be part of the film forming constituent. REDUCTION SOLVENTS The viscosity of the compositions can be adjusted by adding solvents, if necessary. Generally, the composition is utilized at as high a solids content as the application conditions will allow to keep air pollution at a minimum level. Examples of the volatile solvents and diluents which can be used in formulating the coating compositions of the invention are toluene, xylene, butyl acetate, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, butyl alcohol, and other aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, ketones, and alcohols, such as are conventionally used in coating com positions. The criteria of the selection of the solvent is that it will not react with the film forming material, can readily be removed in the application and curing process among other desirable properties. The amount of solvent is controlled to provide the coating composition with the ability of the coating to flow or level out to a smooth surface to provide an acceptable application. TYPES OF COATINGS The different components of the compositions of the present invention can be combined in such a manner that a large number of composition variations are obtained. For example, the pigmentation can be selected so that the composition can be used as a primer for the flexible parts of an automobile. The pigmentation can also be selected so that the composition can be used as a topcoat, either uniform in color or containing a quantity of metallic flake pigment. This composition is again suitable for the flexible parts. Another example is more highly pigmented so called basecoat. These basecoats are designed to be coated over wet on wet with clear non pigmented compositions.The basecoat can be uniform in color or can contain metallic flake pigments. The basecoat is covered over and protected by a clearcoat, and it can be universally used on flexible as well as rigid substrates. The clearcoating of the basecoats can be handled in two different manners. The clearcoat for the flexible can be made from a highly flexible composition and the clearcoat for the rigid substrates of the car can be made from a hard rigid composition. Alternately, the clearcoat composition can be chosen so that the flexibility is great enough for the plastic parts and still suitable for rigid substrates. SUBSTRATES The coating compositions of the present invention can be applied over a variety of substrates, but the ones of most current interest for automobile bodies are ferrous and nonferrous metals and rigid as well as flexible plastic materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane, thermoplastic olefins, thermoset polyurethane, and ethylene propylene terpolymer.These plastic materials may be reinforced with various fibers such as glass. APPLICATION The coating compositions advantageously are applied with spraying equipment. The equipment may use air to atomize the paint or the newer rotating disk or bell. Optionally, the paint may be transferred more efficiently to the substrate if an electrostatic charge is placed on the paint droplets. The coatings are applied at various film thicknesses depending upon the type of coating. Primers for flexible substrates are generally about 0.6 to 1.0 mils thick. Single topcoats for flexible substrates preferably are about 0,8 2.2 mils thick. Basecoats for flexible as well as rigid substrates are about 0.4 1.5 mil thick. The clearcoat on flexible as well as rigid substrates is about 0.8 2.5 mils thick. Typical spray apparatus useful in the present invention include the following a Bink s model num 62 siphon feed, air atomized spray gun b RansburgREA III air atomized, electrostatic spray gun c Behr Bell rotationallly atomized, electrostatic spray machine and d Behr Esta air atomized, electrostatic spray gun. BAKING These coatings are baked at a variety of temperatures from as low as 820 C for 20 minutes to as high as 1930 C for 30 minutes when suitable acid catalyst levels are used. The heat resistance of the flexible or rigid parts may limit the upper baking temperature. Currently used flexible automobile exterior parts will be distorted if baked above 1290 C. The following specific examples further illustrate the applications of the present invention but the invention is not limited to these specific examples. The concentrations are listed in parts by weight unless otherwise indicated.

The resulting acrylic microgel dispersion exhibits the following characteristics Non volatiles 31.1 Acid Number 10.9 Viscosity 12 seconds 4 Ford Cup Color White. EXAMPLE 19 A butylated melamine formaldehyde resin is prepared from the formulation given below Melamine triamino triazine 16.41 Butyl Formcel This commercially available 45.52 preparation consists of 40.0 formalde hyde, 53.0 normal butanol, 7 water Normal Butanol 37.54 Xylene 0.50 Phthallic Anhydride 0.03 100.00 The above materials are charged to a four neck flask, equipped with a thermometer, agitator, reflux condenser, distilling receiver, inert gas inlet and heating mantle. The mixture is heated under agitation and an inert gas blanket until all raw materials have dissolved and the reacting mixture is ref fluxing at 1000 C i 30 C. Water is then removed by azeotropic distillation into the distilling receiver. About 8 parts of water are removed as a by product of the reaction. The reaction mixture is held at reflux until an ASTM tolerance value of 40 45 is obtained by titration of ten 10 grams of the reaction mixture with an ASTM solvent blend which is 84 isooctane, 8 decahydronaphthalene, and 8 toluene as described in ASTM D 1198 73, entitled standard Test Method for SolventTolerance of Amine Resins . The reaction mixture then undergoes solvent removal by vacuum distillation until 48.8 parts of solvent are removed. It is then reduced with 12.4 parts of Xylene and 16.0 parts of normal butanol. The final product has a viscosity ofY at 60.2 non volatile, an ASTM value of 38.7, and an acid number of 0.4.

The black conductive primers of Examples X Z are as follows Example Type of Product X Black Conductive Primer PPG DEL 33434 An aromatic urethane lacquer conduc tive primer conductive when on sub strate dry or wet Y Black Conductive Primer Flexible acrylic with epsilon caprolactone added with monomers. Z Black Conductive Primer Like Y but 2 flexible resins used together, The acrylic resin, lecithin wetting agent, carbon black, graphite and silica are added together in a steel ball mill and rolled for about 24 hours grinding the pigment particles to a fine particle size suitable for primers. The above ground paste is transferred out of the mill to a tank equipped with a high speed mixer. To the above paste is added with rapid agitation the melamine resin and flow agent. The blocked acid catalyst is pre blended with the indicated quantities of ethanol and butanol and is added to the combined ingredients with rapid agitation. The primer is then adjusted to application viscosity with 1100 aromatic solvent. The substrate used for testing is Utithane 114 made byFord Motor Company. It is a polyurethane reaction injection molding which is a polyol isocyanate, catalyst mixture in liquid form which is injected in a plaque designed mold. The materials react rapidly in the mold to form a flexible substrate with high enough modulus to be used on automobiles as flexible parts. The polyurethane substrate is solvent wiped with a xylene ethanol 50 50 blend and is primed in the following manner The black conductive primer X is applied in three coats and primers Y and Z are applied in two coats, with a suction feed gun such as Bink s Model 1162 . The flash between coats is one minute and a five minute flash is used prior to baking in an air circulating oven at 1210 C for 20 minutes.Total dry film build up of the black conductive primers is 0.8 1.0 mil The primers X, Y, and Z were evaluated as primers only. The primers were also evaluated with white enamel topcoats. The white enamels A E as listed in Table 6 and prepared as previously indicated are then applied on the primed with X, Y, and Z polyurethane reaction injection molded plaques 4 X 12 X 1 8 plaques in the following manner The white enamels A E are applied in three coats with a suction feed gun Bink s Model 62 . The flash time between coats is one minute and a five minute flash is used prior to baking in an air circulating oven at 1210 C for 30 minutes.Total dry film build up of the white enamels A E is 1.7 1.9 mils. The following chart specifies coated articles HH, II,JJ, KK, A and E. Coated Article Primer White Topcoat HH Y A II Y E JJ Z A KK Z E A X A E X E Previously reported After aging the coated panels for 72 hours, the films are subjected to the following tests A. Room temperature flexibility A 1 X 6 sec tion of the coated panels is flexed 1800 over a mandrel and observations were made deter mining if the film cracks to any noticeable degree, thus indicating failure. B. Cold flexibility at 290 C A 1 X 6 section of the coated panel is placed in a freezer at 290 C for four hours and then flexed 1800 over a mandrel and observations are made deter mining if the film cracks to any noticeable degree, thus indicating a failure. C. Room temperature flexibility after three months Florida exposure at 50 South A 1 X 6 section of the coated panel is flexed 1800 over a h mandrel and observations were made determining if the film cracks to any noticeable degree, thus indicating a failure. D. Cold flexibility at 29 C after 3 months Florida exposure at 50 South in Florida A 1 X 6 sec tion of the coated panel is placed in a freezer at 290 C for four hours and then flexed in the freezer to an angle of 1800 over a mandrel and observations are made determining if the film cracks to any noticeable degree, thus indicating failure.E. Intercoat adhesion without sanding A coated panel as prepared as previously indicated is re coated primer on primer with the same primer enamel in three coats with a suction feed gun and baked in an air circulating oven at 1210 C for 30 min utes. The recoated dry film build up is 0.8 1.0 mils. The initial coat is not sanded prior to the recoat. A two inch X is made in the film to substrate with a knife edge and one leg of the X is masked with masking tape and the tape is pulled upward at a 900 angle in one rapid motion. The tape is observed for any portion of the recoated enamel not a adhering to the unsanded initial top coats, thus indicating failure. F. Solvent resistance 50 double methyl ethyl ketone rubs A small quantity of methyl ethyl ketone is applied on the coating and the area is then rubbed with a double layer of cheesecloth wrapped around the index finger exerting as great an amount of pressure as possible. A double rub consists of a back and forth motion through a 1 2 area. The number of double rubs are counted up to fifty unless the film solubilized and dissolved prior to fifty. The number of rubs are indicated. G. Yellowing of film after 100 hours QUV accelerated weathering 8 4 cycle A 3 X 6 section of the coated panel is subjected to QW accelerated weathering 8 hours UV commat 710 C 4 hours humidity commat 490 C for 100 hours on a Q panels accelerated Weathering Tester. The panels are then checked for yellowing of the film and recorded.All test results are indicated in Table 11.Table 10 See next page Table 10CONDUCTIVE PRIMER EXAMPLES nXn Byn Z EPSILON CAPROLACTONE MODIFIED 37.05 25.93 ACRYLIC RESIN EXAMPLE num 10 EPSILON CAPROLACTONE MODIFIED ACRYLIC RESIN EXAMPLE num 13 11.12 WETTING AGENT, LECITHINE 00 0.07 KELACIN FD, SPENCER KELLOGG CARBON BLACK CONDUCTEX 975 1 1.19 COLUMBIA CHEMICAL GRAPHITE num 470 MICRO ASBURY 2.60 2.60 GRAPHITE MILLS, INC.
