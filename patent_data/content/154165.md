## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD FOR ABSORBING AND STORING HYDROGEN AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURESTechnical Field This invention relates to a method for storing hydrogen gas, particularly for transportation, at cryogenic temperatures. This invention further relates to a pumping element for a cryopump, particularly for removal and or storage of hydrogen.Background Art The storage of hydrogen, as a gaseous fuel for the operation of fuel cells, has been proposed by Justi, U.S. Patent 3,350,229. This reference appears to recite storage, at about 1830C and atmospheric pressure, sorption of the order of 6 mmol cm3 of porous carbon, which has an apparent density of 0.44 g cm3. This corresponds roughly to a hydrogen adsorption capacity of 13.6 mmol g. However, this figure is derived from an imaginary adsorption capacity , expressed in terms of cm3 of hydrogen, reduced to 760 torr at OOC, per cm3 of adsorbent, measured at l830C, cited byJaeckel, Kleinste Drucke ihre Messung and Erzeugung , Springer Verlag, Berlin 1950 at page 210.Measured values for hydrogen adsorption at I atmosphere at cryogenic temperatures t1970C to I850C of various carbons fall in a range between about 7.3 and 8.7 mmol of hydrogen g of the carbon.Heyland, in U.S. Patent 1.901,446, has proposed storing liquefied gases on bodies such as silica gel or charcoal, indicating that silica gel is the better adsorbent. It has been proposed by Teitel, in U.S.Patent 4,211,537, to store hydrogen in a supply means, comprising a metal hydride hydrogen storage component and a microcavity hydrogen storage component, which in tandem provide hydrogen to an apparatus requiring hydrogen. Wool lam U.S. Patent 4,077,788 recites storage of atomic hydrogen, at liquid helium temperatures, in the presence of a strong magnetic field, in exfoliated layered materials, such as molybdenum disulfide or graphite.The use of porous carbon is suggested by Dietz et al. U.S.Patent 2,760,598 for storage of liquified gases, including liquid air, hydrogen or nitrogen.Savage U.S.Patent 2,626,930 has proposed using chemically active graphi tic carbon for adsorption of gases.Modification of carbon with metallic salts has been disclosed by Keyes U.S.Patent 1,705,482 to produce a material appropriate for the storage of gas or liquid materials.Hecht, in U.S.Patent 3,387,767, has recited a cryosorption pumping element for a high vacuum pump, comprising a mass of sintered fibers and sorbent powders.Other methods proposed for the storage or transportation of hydrogen include the use of metal hydrides and chemical hydrogenation dehydrogenation.Metal hydride systems have been investigated extensively, forexample, storage of hydrogen as iron titanium hydride FeTiH1 95 see, Reilly, Applications of Metal Hydrides , in Andresen et al., ed., Hydrides forEnergy Storage , New York, Pergamon Press 1978 .Hydrogen can also be stored in heavy metal cylinders, so as to avoid the cost of liquifaction. However, use of cylinders is not particularly attractive economically.There is, accordingly, a need for improved method of storing and transporting hydrogen, particularly at cryogenic temperatures.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved method, using carbon, having a high nitrogen BET apparent surface area, for storing hydrogen for transportation or in the context of cryogenic pumping.Disclosure of InventionIn one aspect, this invention relates to a method for storing hydrogen under cryogenic temperatures, comprising adsorbing hydrogen on porous carbon, having a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above about 1500 m2 g. This invention further relates, in high vacuum pump comprising a cryosorption pumping element and means for cooling the pumping element to the cryogenic temperature range, to the improvement wherein the pumping element comprises porous carbon, having a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above about 1500 m2 g.This invention further relates two a panel assembly for a cryoadsorption pump, comprising a high thermal conductivity metal panel adapted for cooling by a cryogenic fluid, the metal panel having mounted thereon a plate of porous carbon having a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above 1500 m2 g.The surface area of carbon adsorbents is essentially controlled by the graphitic structure of the carbon. In an ideal system, one atom of adsorbate if adsorbed between two layers of graphite. The carbon atoms of graphite are arranged in planar layers, approximating a polycyclic aromatic of unlimited extent. The carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, each carbon atom being connected to three other carbon atoms by bonds of equal length, disposed at an angle of 1200 with respect to each other. The bond length is about 1.415 A. These assumptions permit calculation of a total area, on both sides of an isolated sheet one atom thick, of 2610 square meters per gram. For the case of absorbate, adsorbed between two layers of graphite, the maximum surface area would be about 1300 m2 g.However, the measured areas of the Amoco carbons, described below, which can be used in the practice of this invention, exceed this estimate, based on a geometrical maximum. On initial consideration, it is difficult to understand how a structure can have a higher surface area than theoretically possible.This apparent anomaly can be explained by the fact the the measured surface area of an adsorbent may not, in certain cases, represent an area determinable by direct measurements. The surface area is determined, instead, by the almost universally used BET method, which is based on a theoretical model describing adsorption of a vapor on an isolated flat surface. See, Brunauer et al., J.Am.Chem.Soc., vol. 60 1938 at 309.The measurement actually made is that of nitrogen adsorption, at very low temperatures, over a range of pressures. The raw data are processed by an equation, developed from the model, which yields a resulting area, corresponding to the area of the isolated flat surface of the model.Although the assumptions used have been criticized, it should be kept in mind that nitrogen BET apparent surface area measurements generally agree with values of surface areas, obtained by other methods. These methods include those approaching actual physical measurement of area, such as direct microscopic observation of adsorption on glass spheres and geometric measurements on single crystals of metals. In view of their simplicity and reliability, generally, BET apparent surfece areas are widely accepted without necessarily appreciating or clearly stating their indirect nature. It is proposed that, in materials like the Amoco carbons, there are regions in which two carbon surfaces are close enough to each other that adsorption or condensation o f hydrogen nitrogen occurs in a fashion more complex, than pre dieted using the BET model. Values, obtained by the standard calculations, may accordingly be substantially higher than actual surface area, on which condensation is occurring. As a result, carbons having unusually high nitrogen BET apparent surface areas may also have unusually high adsorptive capacities. Porous carbons, which may be used in the practice of this invention, are those having a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above 1500 m2 g. Among materials which meet this requirement are the so called Amoco carbons, described in Wennerberg et al., U.S. Patent 4,082,694, herein incorporated by reference. These carbons are made from coal and or coke by admixture with hydrous potassium hydroxide and are characterized by a very high surface area and a substantially cage like structure, exhibiting microporosity. The products described by tsenner berg et al. have an apparent surface area nitrogen BET of 1800 3000 m2 g for coal derived carbons and of 3D00 4000 m 21g for coke derived carbons. Another type of high surface area carbon useable in the practice of thisInvention is derived from polyvinylidene chloride. A material obtained by heating polyvinylidene chloride at 85000 in an inert gas to produce a char and further heating in an oxidizing atomsphere of C02 at 850eC to a burneff of 24 , has a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above 2300 m2 g. Similarly high surface areas are obtained by burnsff of thus prepared carbon at 10000 C. See, Lamond et al.,Carbon, vol. 1 1963 at page 295. An additional carbon, having the requisite surface area, is made from polyfurfuryl alcohol by heating at 850 C. in an inert gas and further heating in carbon dioxide to E burn off ot at least 67 . See, Lamond et al., Carbon, vol. 3 Q964 at page 283. The unpredictability of adsorption properties of typical carbons is apparent from Fig. 1, which shows hydrogen adsorption Gibbs excess adsorption, NE , reported in the literature, as a function of pressure at l97C. Gibbs excess adsorption, NE, is the excess material present in the pores beyond that which would be present under the normal density at the equilibrium pressure, Kidnay, Adv.Cryogenic Engineering, vol. 12 1967 at page 730. Total pore adsorption, N, is accordingly NT NE NB wherein NB is the amount of hydrogen which can be held, at normal density and equilibrium pressure, in the free pore volume remaining after adsorption. In relating NE to NT, it was assumed that the free pore volume is the measured pore volume of adsorbent cm3 g of carbon minus the total molecular volume of hydrogen adsorbed at a given pressure. The molecular volume of hydrogen was calculated using the value of the constant b 0.02661 L mole from van der Waal s equation. The behavior of coconut shell charcoal, Barneby Cheney type IG 1, with a surface area about 1020 m 2 g, is shown in line 1 , Kidnay et al., supra. The adsorption of Carbotox, a pure charcoal Lurgi Gesellschaft is noted at point 2 , Van tterbeek et al, Physica, vol. 4 1937 at page 389 and that of Fisher 2 coconut charcoal, having a surface area about 1100 rn2 g at point 3 , Basmadjian, Can. J. Chem., vol. 38 1960 at page 141. Line 4 shows the reported behavior of coconut charcoal, Barneby Cheney type GI surface area 1200 1400 m2 g , Tward et al., Proc. Int. Cryog. Eng. Conf. 9th , 1982 at page 34. Absorption of hydrogen by Carbopol H2 is shown in line 5 , Czaplinski et al.,Przemysl Chemiczny, vol 37 t958 at page 640, and that of Degussa activated carbon F12 300 assumed surface area 1125 m2 g is shown by line 6 , Carpetis et al., Int. J Hydrogen Energy, vol. 5 1980 at page 539. At 185.8 C, Columbia 6 G coconut shell activated carbon adsorbed 7.9 mmole of hydrogen gram of carbon at 1 atmosphere Asian et al., SeparationScience, vol. 7 1972 at page 601. It is seen that some presently used carbons are relatively good adsorbents, the Degussa carbon having the highest hydrogen capacity at 1960C reported to the present. At 10 atm hydrogen pressure, the Degussa carbon had a Gibbs excess adsorption of about 3 g hydrogen 100 g of carbon, or a total pore adsorption capacity, NT, of about 3.5 g of hydrogen 100 g of carbon. However, the points and the lines in Fig. 1 also show that there is no precise correlation between surface area and hydrogen adsorption and that adsorption properties are unpredictable and must be determined experimentally. It has been found that the properties of high surface area carbons, useful in the practice of this invention, are influenced by processing of the carbons, prior to use. Carbons in accordance with Wennerberg et al. 694 have a high alkali content.It is preferred that this be removed by extraction with water, after which the carbon is dried in air. Various methods of pretreating water leached Amoco carbon were studied. It is preferred, to preserve the high surface area, to treat the air dried carbon with a stream of nitrogen gas at 400 600 C until no further condensible materials are detected in the effluent stream. Adsorption behavior of thus prepared carbons, which have a nitrogen BET apparent surface area of 2900 3000 m2 g, is shown in Fig. 2. The upper line, 2 1, is the hydrogen adsorption isotherm at 196 C liquid nitrogen and the lower line, 22, represents the hydrogen adsorption isotherm at 1860C liquid argon . it will be apparent that adsorption is markedly affected by pressure, whereas adsorption for some prior art carbons, e.g., coconut charcoal Fig. 1, line 1 is not. It was found that treatment of carbons of Wennerberg et al. 694 with hydrogen at 6000C reduced the oxygen content of the sample, but was accomp anied by a decrease in surface sores, pore volume and hydrogen adsorption. It is proposed that treatment with hydrogen led to elimination of some of the fine pores, initially present in the sample. Slow gasification of carbons of Wennerberg et al. 694 with hydrogen was attempted, so as to amplify the surface area and pore volume. It was surprisingly found, after treatment at 8ûOeC to a weight loss of 32 , that the pore volume was increased from 1.47 to 2.07 cm3 g , with only a small decrease in surface area.However, the cryosorption properties of this sample were considerably poorer than of the nitrogen treated sample. These results suggest that hydrogen treatment led to expansion of large pores, but not of the micropores, which are thought to be the major site of hydrogen adsorption. Treatment of Wennerberg et al. 694 carbons with potassium in liquid ammonia and with lithium led to products which had lower hydrogen capacities than for the nitrogen treated sample. These results were unexpected in view of reports that intercalation compounds of potassium in graphite interact with bydrogen at 210 to 77iC, Watanabe et al., Proc. R. Soc. Lond., vol. A333 1973 at 51. Cryogenic temperatures contemplated for the purposes of this invention are below IOOC . More preferably, these temperatures are below about 1500C. It is preferred that the porous carbon have a surface area above about 2000 m2 gram.More preferably, the porous carbon will have a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above about 2300 m2 g and a bulk density above about 0.25 g cm3. A most preferred, porous carbon has a cage like structure which contributes to over 603b of its surface, as measured by phase contrast, high resolution spectroscopy. These particularly preferred carbons can be made by treating a carbonaceous feed with hydrous potassium hydroxide in an amount of 0.5 5 weights per weight of carbonaceous feed precalcining the mixture of hydrous potassium hydroxide and carbonaceous feed at 315 482 C for 15 min 2 hr and calcining the thus prebealcined feed at 70v982iC for 20 min 4 hr under an inert atmosphere. A further attribute of the porous carbons, used in the practice of this invent ion, is their unexpectedly high adsorptive capacity at very low pressures, particularly below about 10 torr. It is therefore preferred to utilize these carbons under pressures below about 10 torr, more preferably below 1O 2 torr and, most preferably, below 10 4 torr. In low pressure application, the porous carbons of this invention can be used as pumping elements in high vacuum pumps comprising a cryosorption pumping element and means for cooling the pumping element. Preferably, the pumping element will be a panel, having pressed porous carbon thereon. It will be understood that pumping elements can have a variety of configurations, encompassed by the term panels, and that the configurations contemplated are not intended to be limited to planar structures. In a plate assembly for cryoadsorption pumps, as disclosed by Hecht, supra, or by McFarlin in U.S. Patent 4,325,220, both incorporated herein by reference, the porous carbon can be mounted on a panel in the form of a pressed powder or, more preferably, mounted in the form of pellets. Another tvpe of panel structure is that disclosed by Longsworth, U.S Patents 4,150,549, 4,219,588 and 4,277,951, herein incorporated by reference. This structure is further disclosed by Longsworth, Performance of a Cryopump Cooled by a Small Closed Cycle 10K Refrigerator, Advances in Cryogenic Engineering, vol. 23,Plenum Press, New York 1978 , at pages 658 668. The pumping surface comprises one or more nested cylindrical surfaces, on which a gas adsorbing material is porous carbon. This configuration is preferred for pumping elements of the invention. An unexpected property of cryogenic pump elements made in accordance with the teachings of this invention is that the high surface area carbons adsorb at considerably inore hydrogen than would be predicted from the ratios of surface areas of prior art carbons and those used here. This is apparent from Figs. 4 and 5. in Fig. 4 is shown cryopump adsorption of hydrogen on coconut charcoal. This carbon adsorbed about 1.9 SL of hydrogen, before occurrence of a marked drop in adsorption rate. Total hydrogen adsorption for this panel was about 2.3 SL.However, the high surface area carbon, as shown in Fig. 5, adsorbed of the order of 11.4 SL of hydrogen before the adsorption rate dropped to half its initial value. The standard coconut charcoal estimated 27 panel, surface area about 929 m2 g adsorbed about 1.9 SL of hydrogen before the absorption rate dropped to half its starting value. The high surface ares Amoco carbon estimated 40 g panel, surface area 2340 m2 g adsorbed about 11.4 SL of hydrogen. This amount is about 2.5 times that predicted from surface area measurements and about four times that predicted on a weight basis. Thus, typical highly porous carbons preferred for the practice of this invention adsorb about 2.5 times as much hydrogen per panel, or about 1.6 times as much hydrogen per unit weight of carbon, as would be predicted on the basis of the surface area of the carbon. The greatly enhanced adsorption properties of cryopump elements in accordance with the invention means that a cryopump can be operated for much longer periods, prior to shut down for regeneration, than possible heretofore. Application of the principles of this invention to the storage of hydrogen is significant because it will be economically competitive with either liquid hydrogen storage or bulk hydrogen storage. When liquid hydrogen is stored, a major cost factor is that incurred by the liquefaction process. For bulk hydrogen storage, high expenses are incurred in producing the compressed gas and in transporting the gasIn heavy steel cylinders. Both of these expensive requirements are mitigated by the use of high surface area porous carbons. In evaluating the feasibility of using the teachings of this invention for hydrogen transport, total hydrogen capacity of the vessel containing the cryo adsorbent is considered. The bulk density of a preferred carbon, treated at 5000C with nitrogen, is about 0.285 g cm3 and the specific volume is about 3.48 cm3 g. It is thought this volume typically comprises 10.7 of carbon d 2.68 g cm3 42.2 pore volume and 4740 interparticle void.This carbon will accordingly have the following hydrogen storage capacity at 196iC, In mmol g P 1 atm P 10 atm P 20 atmH2 adsorbed, NE 13.3 22.8 25.4 H 2 in micropores 0.3 2.6 5.3 not adsorbed H2 in interparticle void 0.2 1.4 2.6Total mmol g 13.8 26.8 33.3Total g H2 lOO g of C 2.78 5.40 6.71 It will be apparent that the adsorbents used in the practice of this invention have significantly higher storage capacities at high pressures 10 atm than the best known carbon of the prior art.Brief Description of the Drawings In Fig. I are shown adsorption isotherms for prior art carbons at about 77 C. In Fig. 2 are shown adsorption isotherms for a high surface area carbon, used in the practice of this invention. In Fig. 3 is shown variation of isosteric hest of adsorption of a typical carbon of the invention, at 196 C to 186 C. In Figs. 4 and 5, respectively, are shown behavior of coconut charcoal and a high surface area carbon as adsorbents for hydrogen in a cryopump element.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention In a most preferred aspect, porous carbons used in the practice of this invention are those having a nitrogen BET apparent surface area above about 2000 m2 g and a bulk density above about 0.25 g cm3. Most preferably, such a porous carbon will have a cage like structure which contributes to over 60 of its surface, as measured by phase contrast, high resolution microscopy.The porous carbon can be made by treating a carbonaceous feed with hydrous potassium hydroxide in an amount of 0.5 5 weights per weight of carbonaceous feed precalcining the mixture of hydrous potassium hydroxide and carbonaceous feed at 315 4820C for 15 min 2 hr and calcining the thus prewcalcined feed at 704 982eC for 20 min 4 hr under an inert atmosphere. Most preferred utilization conditions are at pressure below 10 2 torr. A most preferred configuration for a pumping element is a cylindrical panel, having pressed porous carbon thereon. Without further elaboration, It is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to Its fullest extent. The following preferred specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative and not imitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. In the following examples, the temperatures are set forth uncorrected in degrees Celsius. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 Super Sorb grade PX 21 carbon Amoco Research Corp., Chicago, nl., lot 7810 had the following properties, tested in accordance with Wennerberg et al., U.S.Patent 3,833,514, herein incorporated by reference SOCo BET surface area, m2 g 3792 old , 3369 new Digisorb BET surface area, m2 g 3143 Pore volume pores 20 diam, cm3 g 0.8029 pores 20 diam, cm3 g 1.48 Average pore diameter, A 24.638 Bulk density, g cm3 0.345 pH of carbon 4.0 Ash, wt 2.94 Water solubles, wt 2.25 This material was extracted in a Soxhlet extractor until no more potassium was removed. After the extracted carbon was dried in air, it was placed in a quartz tube and heated in a stream of nitrogen gas at 5000C until no condensible volatiles were detected in the effluent gas stream. The resulting carbon was handled and stored under an inert atmosphere. The thus prepared sample had a nitrogen BET apparent surface area of 2888 m2 g at liquid nitrogen temperature, determined using a Micromeritics Digisorb apparatus. The total pore volume of the carbon was taken as egual to the volume of liquid nitrogen contained in the carbon pores at the saturation point. Hydrogen adsorption isotherms up to about 30 atm absolute pressure were measured at l960C liquid nitrogen and 186 C liquid argon using a conventional volumetric apparatus, consisting of a basic steel mainfold, Heise dial gauge 0 6000 kPa , MKS diaphragm gauge 1 10,000 mm Hg , Töpler pump for pumping noncondensible gases and a high vacuum source 5x10 6 torr . The carbon sample being tested was held in 8 steel vessel 30 cm3, 2.54 cm inner diam sealed withConoseal Aeroquip Corp. steel nanges and gaskets. The vessel contained a porous metal disc to minimize the loss of carbon during outgassing. The manifold and pressure gauges were thermostatted as appropriate.The sample vessel was held at the required cryogenic temperature using liquid nitrogen 1960C or liquid argon 186 0C . Prior to making the adsorption measurements, the carbon was outgassed overnight under a vacuum of 5 x 10 6 6 torr. Helium was used for dead volume measurements and adsorption of hydrogen at various pressures was measured. The isotherms were calculated, using the virial equation PV nRT i I BniV Cn2 V2 , using values for the virial coefficients B and C taken from Dymond et al., TheVirial Coefficients of Gases, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969 at 158 for hydrogen and at 174 for He. Experimental data at 1960C and 1860C are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, and in Fig. 2. Results in Table 1 were checked by measuring the amount of hydrogen desorbed with decreasing pressure. Hydrogen adsorption isotherms were fitted by the least squares procedure to the empirical equation EMI12.1 In Fig. 2, the amount of hydrogen adsorbed, NEl Gibbs excess adsorption is plotted against hydrogen pressure. At 1960 C, hydrogen adsorption was 13.3, 22.8 and 25.4 mmol H2ig of carbon at 1, 10 and 20 atm H2, respectively. Total hydrogen storage capacity, including all of the hydrogen in a vessel containing cryc adsorbent, was about 5.4 g of H2 g of carbon at 10 atm and .1960 C. The data of Tables 1 and 2 were used used to calculate isosteric heat of adsorption q , defined by the equation EMI12.2 Results are shown in Fig. 3, in which q in cal mol is plotted against NE in mmol Hdg of carbon.

An Amoco carbon sample, extracted with water and dried In air at room temperature, contained 1.2 ash and about 10 oxygen. As a result of heatlng this sample under stream of nitrogen at S00C, the oxygen content was lowered to 6.2 The nltrogen BET apparent surface area, measured with nitrogen at 195.7 C, of a sample treated in this way was about 2900 3000 m2 g. Pore volume ranged from 1.47 to 1.7 cm3 g. Properties of other samples, treated in various ways, are given in Table 3.Example 3 Hydrogen adsorption was determined at 1960C for samples prepared inExample 2. As shown in Table 4, the carbon with the highest adsorptive capacity was that obtained by treating the sample received batch 78 10 in a stream of nitrogen at 5000C until no further volatiles were obtained. Although a similarlytreated sample of another batch 79 1 had a higher pore volume than the first sample, the level of hydrogen adsorption under cryogenic conditions was essentially the same. These results suggest that the relationship between adsorption and pore volume is not clearly understood at the present time. A sample treated with hydrogen at 600 C and then treated under vacuum 10 5 torr at 900 C had a lower surface area than the nitrogen treated samples but a similar pore volume. However, the oxygen content of this sample was reduced to about 1.4 . It is proposed that the reaction with hydrogen caused elimination of some fine pores. Attempts to improve the surface area and pore volume of the carbon by slow gasification with hydrogen at 800 C, to a weight loss of 32 , produced a material with higher pore volume 2.07 cm31g and only slightly decreased surface area 2790 m2 g . However, the product adsorbed less hydrogen under cryogenic conditions than the starting material. It is proposed that treatment with hydrogen caused expansion of larger pores, but not of the micropores, which are thought to be largely responsible for hydrogen adsorption.

The resulting solid samples were dried under vacuum at 300C, z C, and then used without any further purification. A lithium doped carbon was also prepared.Neither of these materials was better than the carbon, untreated except with nitrogen at SDOC. Accordingly, the effect of alkali metal intercalation on hydrogen cryosorption is not clearly understood.Example 4 Densification of Amoco carbon samples was attempted so as to provide an edsorbent providing for maximum hydrogen storage per unit volume. The material received from Amoco had a bulk density of about 0.3 cm3 g.Interparticle void volume of this material was about 47 of the total volume of carbon. Samples of this carbon in a 20 mm diameter steel dye were compressed under a force of 20,000 pounds. The pressing procedure was repeated with Amoco carbons, mixed with various binders. After the materials had returned to ambient pressure, the density, surface area and pore volumes were determined. The following results were obtained Treatment Density BET Surtace Area Pore Volume g cm3 m2 g cm3 g Amoco C control 0.285 2966 1.548Pressed 41,000 psi 0.406 2586 1.359 10 bentonite, pressed 0.503 2365 1.276 15 bentonite, pressed 0447 10 boric acid, pressed 0.422 These results show that moderate compaction was accomplished and that the interparticle void was reduced from 47 to about 30 ot the total volume. The sa mple loaded with 10 of bentonite clay had properties close to theoretical density, having only about 8 of interparticle void, calculated on the assumption that the density of clay is the same as that of real carbon density about 2.68 g cm3 .The results also showed that densification of the carbon brought about decrease in the nitrogen BET apparent surface area and pore volume. Consequently, some decrease in hydrogen cryoadsorption capacity may be expected when densified carbon samples are used. Example 5 The evaluation of two adsorbents in a cryopump was done in accordance with the following procedure In the first revaluation Calgon coconut charcoal in the form of granules 10 x 20 mesh and having a nitrogen BET apparent surface area of about 929 m2 g was mounted with the aid of an adhesive onto a standard cryopump panel, having an area of 458 cm2. In the second evaluation, theCalgon coconut charcoal was replaced by Amoco carbon Type GX31 lot 79 9 In the form of pellets 6 x 31 mesh, on an as received basis and having nitrogen BET apparent surface area of 2340 m2 g . The evaluations were done using each of the foregoing panels in an HV 202 82 cryopump, admitting hydrogen at a constant flow rate and measuring resulting pressure. A mass flow rate of 10 scm3 min 0.127 TL s and a speed of 200 L s means that the cryopump maintained a pressure of 0.127 2000 6.3 x 10 5 Torr. Pumping speed was constant, and determined by geometry, until the adsorbent began to become saturated and hydrogen began to rebound, rather than being adsorbed when it contacted the adsorbent. The now rate, used during the test, was selected so that hydrogen migrated to the interior of the adsorbent almost as fast as it was adsorbed on the surface. Slightly higher speeds were observed after the now of gas was interrupted, because more open sites were available at the surface of the adsorbent. Results are shown in Fig. 1 for prior art coconut charcoal and in Fig. 5 for the Amoco carbon. From these figures, it is clear that the prior art charcoal adsorbed 1.9 SL of hydrogen before the speed dropped to half its initial value. TheAmoco charcoal adsorbed 11.4 SL of hydrogen, before the speed dropped to half its initial ratio. Thus, the Amoco carbon adsorbed about six times as much as the prior art charcoal. This result is surprising in view of approximately 2.5 1 ratios of nitrogen BET apparent surface areas for the carbon samples being tested. After these evaluations, attempts were made to estimate the actual amounts of the respective carbons on the panels. The adsorbent carbons were removed from a representative unit area of the panel, taking care to detach most of the carbon and also to minimize the removal of the adhesive, and were subsequently weighed. The amounts of carbon used in each panel were thus estimated to be 27 g for the coconut charcoal panel and 0 g for the Amoco carbon panel, respectively.
