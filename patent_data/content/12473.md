## Abstract
A process for the preparation of ferrierite by heating at a temperature between 100 and 200 C an aqueous mixture which contains a compound of an alkali metal M , a com pound of aluminum, a compound of silicon, and piperidine and or alkylsubstituted piperidine NR , in which aqueous mixture the various compounds are present in the following molar ratios, which except for piperidine and alkyl substit uted piperidine, are expressed in moles of the oxides SiO₂ Al₂O₃ 15 H₂O SiO₂ 5 500 NR SiO₂ 0.05 1.0, and M₂O Al₂O₃ 1. Ferrierite thus obtained and its use as catalyst or catalyst carrier for converting hydrocarbons and as molecular sieve, for instance for separating hydrocarbons.
