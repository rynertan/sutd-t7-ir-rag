## Description
This invention relates to a new form of polymer, a method for its production and compositions containing it. Maltodextrins glucose polymers are produced by the hydrolysis of pure starch isolated from various natural products, e.g. wheat, rice and tapioca. In a typical process a pure isolated starch is produced by a multi stage separation process involving removal of protein, oil, fibre and glutens before being hydrolysed. As no single number can adequately characterise the molecular weight of a polymer, such as a maltodextrin, various averages are used. The most commonly used are the weight average molecular weight where n We have now found that it is possible to monitor starch hydrolysis and in particular to stop the hydrolytic action when the hydrolysate contains the maximum amount of molecules in the desired molecular weight range. The monitoring may be carried out by a technique known as size exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, fractionation of the starch hydrolysate can be monitored by size exclusion chromatography and a weight average molecular weight, a number average molecular weight and a molecular weight distribution of the products can be determined using chromatographic columns calibrated with dextran standards Alsop et al Process Biochem We have also found a method for optimising the yield of a glucose polymer with a preselected molecular weight range. Glucose polymers are often characterised by the expression degree of polymerisation DP . In this terminology a product may be described as having 20 of its weight comprising molecules with a DP greater than 10, ie. 20 has a molecular weight greater than 1656 a polymer comprising 10 glucose units . British Patent Application 2132914A describes a glucose polymer mixture having at least 15 by weight of glucose polymers of DP greater than 12 for use in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis CAPD . PCT US Application 82 00774 describes a CAPD solution comprising glucose polymers of DP of at least 4. European Patent Application 0076355 A2 discloses glucose polymer mixtures having at least 99 of glucose polymers of DP less than 12 for use in CAPD. European patent specification No 153,164 Milner also discloses glucose polymer mixtures for use in peritoneal dialysis, the mixtures containing more than 50 by weight of glucose polymers of D.P. greater than 12 in the claims and as low as 15 of polymers of D.P. greater than 12 in the examples . Milner makes no mention of the number average molecular weight values for these mixtures, and the mixtures which he discloses span an extremely wide range of possible M It has now been surprisingly found that a small sub range of the wide range of polymer mixtures disclosed by Milner is particularly effective for use in peritoneal dialysis. This sub range is defined by reference to the M According to the present invention there is provided a peritoneal dialysis composition containing an osmotic agent which is a mixture of glucose polymers, wherein at least 50 by weight of the mixture comprises polymers having molecular weights in the range of from 5,000 to 30,000, and wherein the mixture has a weight average molecular weight of from 5,000 to 50,000 and a number average molecular weight of from 2,900 to 8,000, both the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight being determined using chromatographic columns calibrated with dextran standards. The mixture of glucose polymers preferably contains less than 5 by weight of polymers of molecular weight greater than 100,000. More preferably, it contains no more than 20 by weight of polymers having molecular weights of from 800 to 10,000. The composition may additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. It has surprisingly been found that certain polydisperse glucose polymer mixtures of high molecular weight are useful in medicine, e.g. in CAPD and in prevention of post operative adhesions. The glucose polymer mixture of the present invention has at least 50 by weight of polymers of molecular weight in the range 5000 to 30000. We particularly prefer a glucose polymer mixture wherein at least 80 by weight of the polymers are of molecular weight in the range 5000 to 50,000. We prefer the glucose polymer mixture to have a weight average molecular weight in the range of from 5000 to 100000, preferably of from 5000 to 50000, more preferably of from 12000 to 25000, and most preferably of from 14000 to 20000. We prefer the content of mono , di , and tri saccharide compounds present in the glucose polymer mixture to be less than 5 by weight, more preferably less than 2 and most preferably 0 by weight. By 0 we mean an amount which is undetectable by conventional methods. We further prefer that the content of glucose polymers with molecular weight greater than 100000 in the glucose polymer mixture should be less than 5 , preferably less than 3 and most preferably less than 1 by weight. We prefer the glucose polymers to be substantially free from endotoxins and nitrogenous contaminants arising from the original starch, or from the enzyme preparations used for its hydrolysis. We particularly prefer the endotoxin level to be less than 0.25 endotoxin units ml, more preferably less than 0.12 endotoxin units ml and most preferably less than 0.06 endotoxin units ml as determined by the Limilus Lysate Test US Pharmacopoeia . We prefer the nitrogen content of the glucose polymers to be less than 0.01 w w, more preferably less than 0.001 w w and most preferably zero as determined by the Kjeldahl method British Pharmacopoeia . We also prefer the glucose polymers to be substantially free of undesirable metals, e.g. aluminium. Thus we prefer the level of aluminium to be less than 500 ppb, more preferably less than 200 ppb and most preferably less than 100 ppb. We also prefer an aqueous solution comprising 10 w v of the glucose polymer to be substantially clear and colourless. Thus we prefer such a solution to have a turbidity value of less than 30 EEL units US Pharmacopoeia , more preferably less than 20 EEL units and most preferably less than 10 EEL units. We also prefer such a solution to have no substantially visible colour. We particularly prefer the solution to have a visible colour of less than 10 APHA Hazen units and more preferably less than 5 APHA Hazen units. The content of colour precursors such as 5 hydroxymethyl furfural can be measured by absorption of ultraviolet light of wavelength 275 or 284nm. We prefer the absorbance to be less than 0.5, more preferably less than 0.25 and most preferably less than 0.15. The transmission of ultraviolet light measured at a wavelength of 430 nm is preferably greater than 90 and more preferably greater than 95 . We also disclose a glucose polymer I having up to 20 by weight of glucose polymers with a molecular weight of from 800 to 10,000, preferably of from 1500 to 4000. We particularly prefer a glucose polymer I having up to 20 by weight of glucose polymers with a molecular weight of from 1500 to 2500, more preferably up to 10 by weight and most preferably up to 7 by weight. We also disclose a method for the production of a glucose polymer I , which comprises In process a the process parameters used are interdependent and each parameter may vary depending upon the desired quality of the product, the desired molecular weight range, etc. The water miscible solvent may be an alcohol, eg an alkanol, such as ethanol. The solvent may be present in an aqueous solution which is mixed with an aqueous glucose polymer. The concentration of the solvent in the aqueous solution before mixing may be from 60 to 100 v v, preferably from 75 to 90 v v, and most preferably about 85 v v. The concentration of the aqueous glucose polymer solution before mixing may be from 0 to 80 w v, preferably from 15 to 65 w v, and most preferably from 30 to 40 w v. The fractionation may be carried out at a temperature of from 10 to 40 C and more preferably from 20 to 30 C. In process b the type of membrane material used may vary with the particular molecular weight distribution which is desired. A chemically inert plastics material may be used for the membrane, eg. a cellulose acetate or polytetrafluoro ethylene. We particularly prefer to use a material which is mechanically stable at high temperatures and pressures, eg. a polysulphone. A series of membranes may be used consecutively such that both a high and a low molecular weight fractionation is carried out. The membrane fractionation may be carried out at elevated temperature sufficient to prevent bacteriological contamination. We prefer the fractionation to be carried out at a temperature of from 0 to 90 C, preferably from 20 to 80 C, and most preferably from 65 to 75 C. The feed solution may be of a concentration of from 1.0 to 30.0 w v, preferably from 5 to 15 w v and most preferably about 10 w v. The glucose polymer starting material is preferably prepared by a method, e.g. hydrolysis, designed to optimise the proportion of polymer I , and the progress of that method is preferably monitored by size exclusion chromotography. Any starch may be used in the hydrolysis but we prefer to use a cornstarch. The molecular weight distribution of the fractions may be determined using the chromatographic techniques described by Alsop et al J. Chromatography The high molecular weight waste products from the fractionations may be further hydrolysed to produce further quantities of lower molecular weight products which can be fractionated. The low molecular weight waste products may be useful in the production of glucose syrups. Before, during and or after the fractionation of process a or b the polymer may be purified. The purification may be to remove undesirable colour or to remove contaminants, for example proteins, bacteria, bacterial toxins, fibres or trace metals, eg aluminium. Any conventional purification technique may be applied, for example, filtration and or absorption adsorption techniques such as ion exchange or charcoal treatment. The product of the fractionation of process a or b may be packaged and transported as a syrup or solution, for example an aqueous solution. However, we prefer the product to be in a solid form, preferably a powder, and most preferably spray dried granules. The glucose polymer I is useful in a wide variety of medical indications, e.g. peritoneal dialysis, as a nutritional agent or for the prevention of post operative adhesions etc. According to the invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a glucose polymer mixture, wherein at least 50 of the mixture comprises polymers of a molecular weight in the range 5000 to 30000 and wherein the mixture has a weight average molecular weight of from 5,000 to 50,000 and a number average molecular weight of from 2,890 to 8,000, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Any composition for in CAPD preferably comprises physiologically acceptable electrolytes, eg. sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, in order to prevent the transfer of desirable electrolytes from the serum to the peritoneum. The amounts may vary depending upon the requirements of any individual patient and are generally sufficient to provide an osmolarity of from about 240 to 275 mOsm litre see Example A . According to the invention we also provide a physiologically acceptable polysaccharide II with an osmolarity of less than 160 mOsm litre, preferably less than 110 mOsm litre more preferably less than 90 mOsm litre and most preferably less than 20 mOsm litre, which is capable of being used in solution in the dialysis of normal human serum. By normal human serum we mean serum with an osmolarity of between 280 and 290 mOsm litre at 37 C. The polysaccharide II preferably has the molecular weight and other parameters described above with respect to glucose polymer I . Any suitable polysaccharide may be used but we prefer the polysaccharide to be a glucose polymer I . The polysaccharide II may be prepared by any of the processes hereinbefore described or by conventional processes known We also provide a composition capable of dialysing normal human serum comprising a polysaccharide II and having an osmolarity somewhat greater than normal serum. The osmolarity of the composition is preferably less than 400 mOsm litre, more preferably less than 350 mOsm litre and most preferably less than 330 mOsm litre at 37 C. We particularly prefer a composition with an osmolarity less than 300 mOsm litre at 37 C. The composition may be in solid form, eg suitable for extemporaneous production of a solution, or it may be a liquid, eg in the form of an aqueous solution. The composition preferably includes pharmacologically acceptable electrolytes. Such electrolytes may include appropriate ions , eg of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and chloride buffers, eg. lactate, acetate or bisulphite or other additives, such as amino acids, polyols or insulin. The polymer I and the polysaccharide II are advantageous over the prior art. The long term use of high osmolarity glucose solutions in peritoneal dialysis can result in irreversible changes to the peritoneal membrane due to the continuous high pressure differentials across the peritoneum. When a glucose solution with a low osmolarity is used in CAPD for greater than four hours glucose may be lost from the peritoneum to the serum, this is undesirable, particularly in diabetic patients. The present invention provides a method of applying an osmotic pressure over the peritoneum for greater than four hours without causing damage to the peritoneum whilst preventing appreciable loss of polysaccharide to the serum from the peritoneum and maintaining the flow of water from the serum to the peritoneum. The invention will now be described by way of example only and by reference to the attached drawings in which In the Examples OR means optical rotations. The molecular weight distribution of the starch hydrolysate starting material which was used in Examples 1 and 2 is shown in Table 1. The starting material was found to have an The fractionation procedure used to isolate the required molecular weight distribution of a maltodextrin syrup is given in Figure 1. The precise technique to be used will of course be varied to take account of the quality and molecular weight distribution of the maltodextrin used as the starting material. Aqueous ethanol 33 l at 85 v v was added, with stirring, to 37 l of a maltodextrin syrup at 116 OR 23kg, dissolved maltodextrins . After settling the resulting Syrup I 5 l at 92 OR was drawn from the bottom outlet of the fractionator. Aqueous ethanol 40 l at 85 v v was added, with stirring, to the Supernatant I. After settling the Supernatant II 84 l at 13.5 OR was decanted. Aqueous ethanol 75 l at 85 v v and pyrogen free water 25 l were added, with stirring, to the Syrup II 46 l at 50.25 OR . After settling the Supernatant III 103 l at 3.5 OR was decanted. Aqueous ethanol 54 l at 85 v v and pyrogen free water 14 l were added, with stirring, to the resulting Syrup III 13 l at 104 OR . After settling the Supernatant IV 69 l at 3.4 OR was decanted. Aqueous ethanol 48 l at 85 v v and pyrogen free water 12 l were added with stirring, to the resulting Syrup IV 12 l at 98 OR . After settling the required maltodextrin fraction, Syrup V, 10.51 at 102.4 OR 5.5kg dissolved maltodextrins was drawn off. This represents 23.9 recovery of the maltodextrins present in the initial syrup. 3.8kg of Syrup V was dissolved in pyrogen free water 25 l and refluxed with stirring in the presence of 0.4kg of activated carbon Norit UK, GSX grade . The carbon was removed by filtration and the resulting syrup was used to prepare peritoneal dialysis solutions. The The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using the quantities shown in Figure 2. However, the carbon treatment was carried out by adding the activated carbon Norit UK, grade GSX 5kg to the alcoholic Syrup V. The alcohol was removed by steam distillation and the carbon by depth filtration Carlson Ford grade NA90 . The resulting syrup was then spray dried. The The The molecular weight distribution of the starting material is shown in Table 4. The starting material had an The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using the quantities shown in Figure 3. However, the carbon treatment was carried out by adding the activated carbon Norit UK, Grade GSX 60kg to the alcoholic syrup IV. The activated carbon was filtered off by depth filtration Carlson Ford Grade O pads . A further carbon treatment was carried out on the syrup VI 15kg Norit UK Grade GSX, filtered off using Carlson Ford Grade NA90 pads during ethanol removal by steam distillation. The ethanol free syrup was spray dried. The The molecular weight distribution of the starting material is shown in Table 6. The starting material had an The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using the quantities shown in Figure 5. The carbon treatment was carried out by adding activated carbon Norit UK, Grade GSX, 20kg to the alcoholic syrup IV. The carbon was filtered by depth filtration Carlson Ford Grade O pads . Ethanol was removed from the final syrup syrup V by steam distillation and the aqueous product ion exchanged mixed bed system , and spray dried. The mixed bed resin was Duolite A1725 in the hydroxyl form and C225H in the chloride form. Duolite is a trade mark . The A high molecular weight fractionation was carried out by passing 2.0kg of starch hydrolysate, molecular weight distribution, see Table 8 , as a 10 w v solution 20 litres through a series of membranes. Polysulphone membranes with an approximate molecular weight cut off of 25,000 and an area of 0.144m² were used. The feed flowrate was 6.6 litres min at a temperature of 70 C. The total solids level of the retained liquid was maintained at 10 w v and the low molecular weight species were washed through the membrane. After 5.5 hours the concentration of carbohydrate in the permeate product stream leaving the ultrafiltration module was undetectable see Table 9 and the process was terminated. The high molecular weight residues were recovered from the membrane 0.384 kg, 19.2 and the permeative low molecular weight product was isolated from the permeate 1.61 kg, 80.6 . The molecular weight distribution of the permeate is shown in Table 10. M 1.7kg of maltodextrin from Example 5a in 53 litres of pyrogen free water was mixed with 132.5 litres of aqueous ethanol 85 v v . The syrup from the fractionation had an M Two examples of peritoneal dialysis solutions are shown below. The ionic electrolytes behave ideally and therefore 1 mOsm l is equivalent to 1 mmol l.
