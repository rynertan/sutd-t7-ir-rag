# Method and apparatus for checking packages.

## Abstract
Packages 12a to 12e are deposited individually by a delivery mechanism 10 to a fast moving conveyor 27 which accelerates the package. If a heat sealed trailing end of the package is faulty, relative movement between the package product P therein causes the product to force the end open and product is lost from the package. The loss of product is detected by a sensor 32 which provides a signal causing the faulty package to be rejected.
