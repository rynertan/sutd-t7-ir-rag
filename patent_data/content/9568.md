# Liner construction for stack like structures and a method of constructing such a liner construction.

## Abstract
A liner construction for stack like structures, such as industrial and utility type chimneys and method for forming such a construction are disclosed. The liner includes a plural ity of rods or cables supported at their upper ends to an upper portion of a chimney structure and extends down wardly within the chimney and over a substantial length of the height of the chimney. A plurality of hoops or the like are secured to the rods to form a framework of open sections. Mesh is secured to the framework. A body of non metallic settable material such as concrete encases the mesh and framework. Tubular heat insulation may be secured to the framework to abut the outer surface of the concrete body. The method for forming the liner includes the initial step of suspending a tubular framework of open sections from an upper portion of a chimney to extend downwardly within the confines of the chimney and over a substantial length of the chimney height. Mesh is secured to the framework to define a generally tubular shell. A mortar of non metallic settable material such as concrete is applied to the mesh beginning the bottom and continuing upwardly to the top of the shell to complete the liner.
