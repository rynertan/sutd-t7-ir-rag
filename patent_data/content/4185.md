## Description
IMPROVED METHOD OF MAKING A NUT WITH A CAPTIVE WASHER, AND A NUT MADE BY THE METHOD The present invention relates to a method of making a nut with a captive freely rotatable washer, and to a nut made by this method. Nuts of this type, having captive but freely rotatable washers, are commonly used to secure wheels to vehicles where the wheel centre bore is located on a hub spigot to provide a concentric assembly, and the wheel nuts are used simply to secure the wheel to studs on the wheel hub, but not to centre the wheel. Whilst the nut is tightened, the washer remains stationary on the wheel nave, thus substantially eliminating friction between the washer and the wheel and enabling a controlled tightening of the nut with less effort. Furthermore, the tightening load is spread by the washer over a greater area than if the nut alone were used, and if the washer has a generally conical shape, inaccuracies between the mating surfaces of the washer and the wheel can be compensated. In a conventional method of making nuts having captive washers, the nuts and the washers are made separately and are then assembled together by fitting the washer over an integral annular flange or neck which extends from one end face of the nut this flange is then deformed around the inner periphery of the washer to rivet the two parts loosely together. This known method does have certain disadvantages.The separate production and subsequent assembly of the nut and washer is a relatively involved procedure compared to the production of ordinary nuts, and the finished product is as a result comparatively expensive. Furthermore, as the bearing surfaces of the nut and the washer are not always in true , unless a washer of either a different material or of a different hardness to that of the nut is used,local friction welding of the two parts can occur when the nut is tightened. The invention provides a method of making a nut of the kind described which is simpler and less expensive to carry out than known methods and which is capable of producing a nut and captive washer which have true bearing surfaces. In a method according to the present invention, the nut and washer are formed integrally from a single blank and are then at least partially separated by a metal removing operation which leaves a web of material on one or both parts which, when the nut and washer are fully separated, is used to retain the washer and the nut together in the desired freely rotatable condition. By using a method in which the nut and washer are formed integrally from the same blank, the two parts can be formed simultaneously in the same shaping operation and very little material is wasted. In addition, as the bearing surfaces are formed during the metal removing operation, these bearing surfaces can be made true. The metal removing operation is suitably a machining operation, and the nut and washer are preferably formed integrally from the blank by forging. The web of material left after the metal removing operation is preferably an annular web u material connected to the nut, but the web may have any suitable configuration for example it may be discontinuous and it may be connected to either the nut or the washer, or to both. In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises the steps of shaping a generally sleeved shaped blank to form a nut part at one end and a washer part at the other, and removing a circumferential ring of material from the exterior of the blank at a position intermediate the ends of the blank to leave a web of material between the two parts, separating the nut from the washer by fracturing the material along the join between the web and the washer, pushing the washer towards the nut to surround the web, and deforming the web radially outwardly so as to capture the washer against the nut in a freely rotatable condition. Preferably, this embodiment of the method further comprises the step of removing a ring of material from the bore of the washer so that the join between the web and the washer is more readily frangible. The invention also provides a nut having a captive freely rotatable washer whenever made by a method according to the invention. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows an elevational view, partly in section of a conventional nut and washer before assembly, Fig. 2 shows an elevation partly in section of the conventional nut and washer shown in Fig. 1, after assembly, Fig. 3 shows an elevation, partly in section, of a cylindrical blank used in the method of the invention, and Fig. 4 shows an axial section through a nut and washer being formed by a method in accordance with the invention, the left hand half of the Figure showing the blank at an intermediate stage in the method and the right hand half showing the finished assembly. Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows a conventional wheel nut 1 which is provided with a cylindrical flange or neck 2 used for connecting the nut to a conical washer 3.The nut and the washer are first formed separately for example by hot, warm or cold forging and the nut blank is then pierced and tapped. The washer is then made captive on the nut by slipping it over the flange 2, and the flange is then deformed radially outwardly at its free end to retain the washer over the nut as shown in Fig. 2. The washer 3 is only loosely held around the flange 2 to allow the washer to rotate freely with respect to the nut 1. As the mating surfaces between the washer and the nut are not generally true when the two parts are made by this method, it is usual to form the washer from a material which is harder than the nut 1, or to subject the washer 3 to a hardening treatment prior to assembling the parts together.This avoids friction welding of the two parts during tightening. In the method according to the invention, the nut and the washer are made simultaneously from the same blank.Fig. 3 shows a stepped cylindrical blank 4 which is used at an intermediate stage in the method according to the invention. This blank 4 is produced in a two stage forging operation in which first the external shape having smaller diameter end 5, intermediate collar 15 and larger diameter end 6 is formed, and then the internal shape shown is produced. At either stage in the forging operation the smaller diameter end 5 may be given a hexagonal shape as shown.The forming operation used to produce the blank 4 is a conventional hot, warm or cold forging process. The blank 4 is then pierced to produce the blank 4 in the left hand side of Fig. 4, and is then subsequently tapped to provide the internal thread 16 which is omitted from this part of the Figure for clarity . It will be appreciated that these forming and shaping steps can be re arranged to suit the particular type of operation employed for example, the hexagonal shaping of the blank may be carried out in the third stage, at which the blank is also pierced simultaneously and then tapped to provide the internal thread. The blank 4 is then subjected to a machining operation in which an annular portion 7 is removed from the intermediate collar 15 to leave a thin annular web 8 joining the end portions 5 and 6 together. The tool used in the machining operation leaves parallel, equally inclined bearing surfaces 17 and 18 respectively on the end portions 5 and 6. These end portions 5 and 6 form respectively the hexagonal nut 9 and the annular washer 10 shown in Fig. 4. In addition to the portion 7 being machined, an annular ring 11 may be removed from the bore of the end portion 6, but this is not essential. The join 12 between the web 8 and the washer portion 6 is then fractured to separate the washer 10 completely from the nut 9, and the washer 10 is then pushed axially over the web 8 until it abuts the lower surface of the nut 9. The web 8 is then deformed radially outwardly to assemble the nut and the washer together, retaining the washer rotatably on the nut as shown on the right of Fig. 4. The fracturing and assembly steps may be carried out in a single pressing operation for example over a conical lower die which also forms the web 8 into its washer retaining shape, as shown on the right of Fig. 4. Machining away the ring portion 11 assists in the separation of the washer from the nut, and it will be appreciated that if desired, this portion can be removed to a depth which completely separates the lower part 6 from the web 8. This eliminates the need for a fracturing stage. The operations of tapping, machining and pressing may if desired be carried out on more than one machine, but preferably a single machine is used. Machining the blank 4 results in a nut and washer pair which are provided with true bearing surfaces which will fit together with negligible rough areas which could become welded during tightening. In addition, the manufacture of the nut and washer from a single blank has significant advantages in terms of cost over the known methods where separate parts are produced, and a more rapid production of the assemblies is possible using the method according to the invention. For certain applications, differing properties e.g.hardness value may be required between the nut and the washer, in which case selective treatment e.g. hardening, of one or both of the nut and washer assembly may be carried out at any stage in the process, for example at the stage shown in the left of Fig. 4, with the portion 7 and portion 11 removed if desired. While the process described in connection with Figs.3 and 4 results in a nut and washer which have parallel, equally inclined bearing surfaces, it may be desirable to form these bearing surfaces in any other matching configuration for example they may be spherical or partspherical.
