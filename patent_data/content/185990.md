# Charge coupled device.

## Abstract
A charge coupled device includes a transfer channel 32 having an n type region 32A formed in the surface area of a p type silicon substrate 30 and a plurality of electrodes formed over and insulated from the transfer channel 32 and arranged in the direction in which the transfer channel extends. The charge coupled device further includes an n type region 32B formed in the n type region 32A with an impurity concentration higher than that of the region 32A .
