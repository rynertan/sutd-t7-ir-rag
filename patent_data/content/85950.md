# Temperature control device for fixing heat source of copying machine.

## Abstract
A temperature control device for a fixing heat source of a copying machine includes circuits 6, 22, 24, 28, 30, 32, 64 for supplying power to the fixing heat source 4 in synchronism with the zero cross point of an a.c. signal applied from an a.c. power source 2 . The device functions to supply the full wave current to the heat source 4 until a first predeter mined temperature T1 is sensed by a temperature sensor 14 , to supply the half wave current to the heat source until a second predetermined temperature T2 is then sensed, and to change the duty factor D1, D2 of the half wave current after attainment of the second predetermined temperature T2 , thereby maintaining constant the temperature of the heat source with high accuracy.
