# Bearing assembly with improved inner race.

## Abstract
A bearing assembly suitable for use as a trolley wheel for overhead conveyors, includes a multipart inner race 36, 50 in which one annular part, preferably machined from steel, bears the major loading on the assembly and the other annu lar part, preferably formed from sheet metal, bears only minor loading. The major load bearing inner race part 36 extends on either side of the minimum diameter of the inner raceway and allows a full complement of balls 30 to be inserted in place between the inner and outer raceways without heating and expansion, or contraction, or any other treatment of the inner or outer race parts. The minor load bearing inner race part 50 is preferably clamped to the major load bearing part 36 and provides a contoured extension of the major load bearing raceway for guidance and ball retention purposes. Preferably, the outer race outer circumference is curved to accommodate a sloped support track in overhead conveyors such that the loading force is directed through the balls 30 to the major load bearing inner race part 36 .
