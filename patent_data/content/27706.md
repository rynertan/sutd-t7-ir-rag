## Description
Latex bound paperThis invention relates to latex bound paper, and provides non asbestos alternatives to latex bound asbestos papers.Latex bound papers based on asbestos fibres are employed in the manufacture of gaskets and seals for use in motor vehicles, where they must be resistant to water, anti freeze, oil and petrol and withstand fairly high temperatures, e.g. 1500C. They are also used in the chemical industry in making seals resistant to chemical attack. They are commonly made in the form of flexible sheet of thickness 0.1 1.5mm on conventional paper making machines such as the Fourdrinier. In the process an aqueous slurry of the ingredients which are to compose the product is progressively dewatered as a layer on a water permeable conveyor usually of wire mesh , the dewatered layer being subsequently compressed and dried.According to the invention, non asbestos paper comprises vitreous fibres derived from wool form material, organic web forming fibres, unfired ball clay and water insoluble non fibrous particulate inorganic filler, the whole being bound toqether by a cured nitrile rubber said paper being made by dewatering as a layer on a water permeable conveyor an aqueous slurry whose solids content comprises by weight vitreous wool form material 20 40 organic web formins fibre 5 15 ball clay 5 20 nitrile rubber 10 20 inorganic non fibrous filler 5 50 and compressing and drying the layer of dewatered slurry.The vitreous wool form fibre employed is preferably glass wool, mineral wool or ceramic fibre wool. If glass wool is used it is preferably employed in a form which has been treated with a silane coupling agent e.g.gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane .The function of the organic web forming fibres is primarily to enable the paper to be formed on conventional paper making machinery, but additionally those fibres impart strength to the total matrix of the finished paper, just as the vitreous fibres derived from wool form material the primary reinforcement do. The organic web forming fibres are preferably cellulose fibres, but may alternatively be polyethylene or polypropylene fibres of the kind commercially available under the name PULPEX. The function of the ball clay is to impart handlability to the paper sheet during manufacture. To improve the drainage properties of the ball clay containing slurry, it is preferable to include a small proportion of bentonite up to about 5E by weight of total solids in the slurry.The water insoluble non fibrous particulate inorganic filler may be of the kind conventionally used in paper manufacture, for example calcium carbonate, talc, calcium sulphate, kaolin, titanium dioxide, magnesium silicate, or barytes barium sulphate . The use of barytes, which both densifies and improves the oil resistance of the paper, is particularly preferred.The nitrile rubber, which bonds all the fibrous and non fibrous particles of the paper together, is introduced during manufacture as a latex, together with a vulcanising curing agent of the usual kind.The paper may contain small amounts e.g. O.5 2.5 by weight of fibres other than the vitreous fibres derived from wool form material and the web forming fibres. Such other fibres may for instance be low modulus carbon fibres or water dispersible E glass fibres. Such fibres improve green strength of the paper during manufacture additionally the low modulus carbon fibres impart lubricity to the finished paper. Low modulus here means a Young s modulus in tension below 125GPa. A melamine formaldehyde resin, suitably at about 1 by weight, can be included in the slurry that is dewatered, in order to promote bonding between the various fibres and the nitrile rubber.A small quantity 0.002 0.01 by dry weight of total solids in the slurry of a flocculating agent of the kind e.g. a polyacrylamide polyelectrolyte ordinarily used in paper making can be included in order to facilitate sheet formation and subsequent dewatering. The invention is further illustrated by the following Example. ExampleA. Preparation of Stock i Lapponia pulp bleached softwood sulphate pulp in sheet form was made into an aqueous slurry of solids content about 3 by weight and treated in a disc refiner until its freeness reached the desired value measured in degrees Schopper Riegler, OSR . ii The other ingredients for incorporation in the slurry to be dewatered were added to enough water in a beater to bring the total solids content of the mix to about 5 by weight. The order of addition of the materials to the beater was a. Wood pulp at desired freeness with 182 litres of water at 40 450C. b. Ball clay passing sieve of aperture 5pom , and bentonite and barytes both passing sieve of aperture 0.15mm . c. Mineral wool fibre length Q25 5mm and free from shot i.e. granular vitreous material and E glass fibre borosilicate glass containing less than 1 of alkali calculated as tla2O 12mm fibre length or carbon fibre modulus in tension, 25 GPa fibre length 12mm . d. Papermakers alum to reduce pH to 4. e. Melamine formaldehyde resin MF resin f. Sodium hydroxide to raise pH to 7 8. g. Conventional vulcanising agent dispersion active ingredients sulphur, zinc oxide and zinc dithiocarbamate diluted with an equal volume of water. h. Conventional wax emulsion function to improve water resistance of the finished paper diluted with an equal volume of water. Conventional nitrile rubber latex aqueous acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer butadiene content of copolymer, 55 particle size 0.1 ism 40 solids content diluted with 10 times its volume of water. j. Alum to reduce pH to 4.5. NOTE Where the wood pulp employed was of high OSR, the pulp was added after the final alum addition.iii The slurry resulting from ii was diluted to a solids content of 1 3 by weight, and flocculating agent was added to it immediately before passage to the paper making machine.B. Preparation of Paper The stocks slurries prepared as in A. above from various formulations as set out in tableS1 3 following were made into flexible sheet material in an entirely conventional way on a Fourdrinier flat wire paper machine, such as is described in Chapters 10 and 11 of Paper and Board i anufacture by Julius Grant, James H. young, and Barry G. Watson Publishers Technical Division, The British Paper and Board Industry Federation, London, 1978 . The slurry. is progressively dewatered as it travels on the water permeable conveyor of the machine, and the dewatered material is consolidated by pressing between rollers, and then dried to low moisture content suitably 2 by weight . The properties of the paper produced are shown in the Tables. The cold calendering referred to in Table I was carried out as follows Paper was passed at room temperature between two smooth faced steel rolls the gap between which was adjustable to control the density of the paper. Two such passes were made on the papers whose properties are reported in Table I. The hot calendering referred to in Table I was carried out as for cold calendering but with the difference that the steel rolls were heated to about a temperature of 1450C. Again, two such passes were made on the papers whose properties are reported in Table I. The purpose of hot calendering as opposed to cold calendering on latex bound papers is to cause some flow of the latex, thus producing greater consolidation and a higher density.The papers all passed a standard test of flexibility. To pass this, a specimen of the paper 50mum x 230mm, with the 230mm side parallel to the grain should show no evidence of breaking when bent through 1800 around a mandrel of 50mm diameter, with use of just enough force to keep the specimen in contact with the mandrel.
