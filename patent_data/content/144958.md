# METHOD OF FLUSHING

## Abstract
A method for sanitizing flush toilets wherein a sanitizing agent and a triphenylmethane dyestuff are dispensed into the toilet flush water. The dyestuff is resistant to attack by the sanitizing and therefore provides an aesthetically pleasing color to the water remaining in the bowl during the time period between flushes. The dyestuff has the general Formula I, wherein X represents hydrogen or the group SO₃M Y represents hydrogen or hydroxy R and R¹ both represent m MSO₃ benzyl where M represents an alkali metal cation, an ammonium ion or an alkaline earth metal cation, and in the event that X is MSO₃, R and R¹ can furthermore be defined by R representing benzyl optionally substituted in the benzene ring by SO₃M in which M is as defined above and R¹ representing a non tertiary C₁ to C₄ alkyl. The invention also deals with novel members of said general Formula I.
