# MAGNETOMECHANICAL TRANSDUCERS UTILIZING RESONANT FREQUENCY

## Abstract
A target system adapted for use in a magnetomechanic al transducer system is activated by an ac magnetic field and a variable dc bias field to produce a resonant frequency which corresponds to the effective strength of the dc bias field. The target includes an elongated ductile strip of magnetostrictive ferromagnetic material enclosed in a non magnetic container in a manner to allow the strip to vibrate freely. The strip has a magnetomechanical coupling factor, k greater than 0, where K zero 1 fr² fa² , fr and fa being the resonant and anti resonant frequencies, respectively. The system is economical to construct and affords accurate and efficient measurement of pressure via displacements and angles at locations proximate to or remote from the signal source target .
