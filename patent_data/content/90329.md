# Amplitude modulator.

## Abstract
An amplitude modulator is disclosed which has first and second differential pairs of transistor Q6, Q7, Q4, Q5 whose bases are supplied with a carrier signal, and a third differential pair of transistors Q8, Q9 whose collectors are respectively connected to the common emitters of the first and second differential pairs of transistors and of which one transistor is supplied at a base with a modulating signal. The emitters of the first differential pair of transistors Q6, Q7 are connected together through the corresponding re sistors R10, R11 . The collectors of two transistors Q6, Q5 which are included in the first and second differential pair of transistors and perform the same phase operation are connected together and further connected to a load resistor R6 .
