# REFRACTORY COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A self setting, foamed, basic refractory composition com prises a basic particulate refractory material, a surfactant and a binder comprising alkali metal silicate or an alkali stabilised aqueous solution of a phenolformaldehyde resol resin and as setting agent for the binder an ester in liquid form. The refrac tory composition is suitable for forming the inner lining of a molten metal handling vessel e.g. a continuous casting tundish.
