# Apparatus for cutting hollow pipes.

## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting hollow, metal, spirally formed pipes is disclosed. The apparatus uses two passive, rotatable knife blades to cut the pipe. An upper knife blade is positioned inside the pipe so that its cutting edge is adjacent to the inner pipe surface. A lower knife blade is positioned outside of the pipe so that its cutting edge is adjacent to the cutting edge of the upper knife blade in the lateral direction, but is clear of the pipe and upper knife blade in the longitudinal direction. To cut the pipe the lower knife blade is raised until its cutting edge overlaps the cutting edge of the upper knife blade. The knife blades then puncture the pipe. The pipe is rotated through the overlapping blades to completely cut the pipe. Since the pipe moves spirally i.e., it moves forward while it rotates , the knife blades are adapted to move in the direction of the pipe during the cutting process. This permits the overlapping knife blades to cut the pipe rectangularly. The upper knife blade is attached to a cantilevered boom, and the lower knife blade is attached to a knife holder and a vertical raising device. These compo nents are all attached to sliding guide rails so that they move with the cutting blades in the direction of the moving pipe dur ing the cutting process.

## Description
APPARATUS FOR CUTTING HOLLOW PIPES This invention relates to an apparatus for cutting hollow pipes, particularly spirally formed, hollow metal pipes. Hollow metal pipes are widely used for ventilation ducts. These pipes are formed from a continuous strip of thin metal. My commonly owned, pending U.S. patent application, Serial No. 569,752, filed January 10, 1984, describes a preferred machine for making triple ribbed, spiral seam pipe. U.S.Patent No. 3,132,616 Hale describes another type of machine for making corrugated, spiral seamed pipe.Both types of machine start with a flat strip of metal.The strip passes through a series of rollers which bend the edges into predetermined shapes, and form parallel corrugations or reinforcing ribs in the strip. The strip then passes around the inner surface of a forming head a mandrel in a spiral manner, so that the strip takes a spiral shape with opposite edges of the strip meshing. The intermeshed edges of the strip are then compressed to form the pipe with a spiral lockseam.The strip is continuously fed into the machine to continuously produce spiral seamed pipe. At some point the pipe will reach its desired length and must be cut. The assignee of this invention has previously used a rotary saw for cutting the pipe.The saw is mounted on or near the machine, outside the pipe, where it does not interfere with the pipe forming process. When the pipe is ready to be cut, it stops moving. The saw blade is then moved into its cutting position and penetrates the pipe. The metal strip material and pipe forming operation then begin again at a slow speed. This causes the pipe to move forward and rotate. The saw is adapted to move with the pipe for one complete rotation, whereupon the pipe is completely severed. The saw is then returned to its starting position clear of the tube, and the cut pipe section is discharged onto a run off table. The tube forming process is then repeated to produce another section of pipe. Hale also discloses a saw blade disposed outside of a spiral seamed, hollow pipe for cutting the pipe into sections. There are several disadvantages to using high speed saws to cut metal pipes. First, the saw blade, which rotates as fast as 5000 RPM, is dangerous to the machine operator and to anyone near the machine. Second, the saw generates a lot of sparks when it cuts the metal, which also creates a hazardous situation. Anyone near the machine must wear safety glasses to protect himself from the sparks. Third, the saw cut leaves burrs on the edge of the pipe. These burrs must be filed off by someone, who must be careful not to cut himself on the burrs. Finally, the cutting operation is very noisy. The present invention is directed to a new type of cutting apparatus for hollow metal pipes that overcomes the disadvantages of high speed saw blades. According to this invention, a first rotatable cutting blade is to be positioned inside a hollow metal pipe. A second rotatable cutting blade is positioned outside of the pipe. The second blade is moved towards the first blade so that the blades overlap to puncture the pipe surface. The blades are adapted to move together in the direction of the pipe, so that they will cut the pipe as the pipe moves forward and rotates between the overlapping cutting blades. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the first blade is rotatably mounted in the front end of a boom. The boom and first blade are positioned inside the pipe so that the axis of the blade is parallel to the axis of the pipe, and the circumferential edge of the blade is adjacent the inner pipe surface. The second blade is rotatably mounted in a holder outside of the pipe. The axis of the second blade should be parallel to the axis of the pipe, and its circumferential edge should be adjacent to the circumferential edge of the first blade in a lateral direction. To cut the pipe, the holder is moved to a position where the edges of the first and second blades overlap and puncture the pipe.Sliding guide rails carry the boom, holder and first and second blades together in the direction of the pipe, so that first and second blades cut the pipe perpendicularly to the pipe axis as the pipe rotates between the overlapping edges of the blade. The cutting blades of the present invention use a shearing action, like scissors, to cut the pipe.The pipe is cut without the sparks, noise and danger of a high speed saw blade. Thus, the present invention provides a safer environment for manufacturing spiral seamed pipes. Further, the cutting process of the present invention does not leave burrs on the ends of the cut pipe sections. This increases the efficiency of the pipe forming process because manpower does not have to be utilized to de burr the cut pipes. Still further, the cutting apparatus of the present invention may be easily adapted to existing spiral pipe producing machines. The invention itself, together with further objects and attendant advantages, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description taken in conjuction with the drawings.

Referring now to the drawings, FIGS. 1 3 show elements of a spiral pipe forming machine 10 which is used with the slitter assembly 50 of the present invention. The present invention illustrated and shown herein is implemented with a spiral pipe producing machine of the assignee of this invention. A particular type of such machine is described in my pending, commonly owned U.S.patent application, serial number 569,752, filed January 10, 1985. It should be understood, however, that the present invention is intended to be used with any type of spiral pipe producing machine. The spiral pipe producing machine shown inFIGS. 1 3 herein will be briefly described. For a more detailed explanation of spiral pipe producing machines, reference should be made to my pending patent application, particularly with respect to Figures 1, 2, 6 and 7, orU.S. Patent No. 3,132,616 Hale . This patent applica tion and patent are incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof for their descriptions of spiral pipe producing machines. The spiral pipe producing machine 10 has a frame 11 which rests on a base gila. Guide slot llb is provided in the base lla to adjust the angular orientation of the machine frame 11 with respect to the forming head 21 to determine the diameter of the pipe 42 produced by the machine. A scale lic is provided to indicate the angular orientation of the machine. Guide slot lld provides adjustment for the lower drive roller 17. A control cabinet 12 is connected the frame 11. A plurality of control knobs, gauges, and dials 14 are located on the control panel 13 for controlling and monitoring the operation of the machine 10 and the slitter assembly 50. The functions of the various control switches will be described in detail below in connection with FIG. 14. A roller housing 16 is mounted in the frame 11. The roller housing contains a plurality of rollers which bend the edges of the metal strip 15 in predetermined shapes for forming a lockseam, and which may form corrugation grooves and stiffening ribs in the metal strip. An upper drive roller 18 and a lower drive roller 17 are rotatably mounted within the frame 11 adjacent the roller housing 16. The upper drive roller 18 pulls the metal strip 15 into the frame 11, through the roller housing 16, and over the lower drive roller 17. The drive rollers then cooperate to push the metal strip 15 between the upper guide plates 19 and the lower guide plates 20 into the forming head 21. The forming head 21 curls the metal strip into a cylindrical spiral, whereby the opposing, preformed edges of the strip 15 mesh. The meshed or mated edges are then compressed between a support roller 32 and a clinching roller 34 to form a lockseam 43. The metal strip 15 is continuously pushed by the drive rollers 17, 18 through the forming head 21 and between the clinching roller 34 and support roller 32, in a spiral manner, so that a hollow, cylindrical metal pipe 42 is continuously produced with a spiral lockseam 43. The support roller 32 is mounted on the upper guide plate 19. A support arm 22 pushes down on the support roller 32 and holds it in place. This support arm 22 has a thinner cross section than the support arms that have been previously used in the assignee s spiral pipe producing machines. A thinner support arm is preferred because it can fit within the tight confines of the slitter assembly 50. The support arm 22 rotates about an eccentric shaft 25, so that it comes over. the holding arm 33 and then clamps down the support roller 32. A locking pin 28 on the support arm fits within a lip 29 attached to the forming head base 23 when the support arm 22 is in its clamping position.The eccentric shaft 25 also allows the support arm 22 to swing clear of the forming head 21 when the support arm is not in its clamping position. A control lever 26 is used to rotate the support arm 22 about its eccentric axis 25, and controls the pressure applied to the support roller 32. The locking lever 27 releases or locks the control lever 26. The clinching roller 34 is moved into and out of its clinching position by a conventional hydraulic cylinder assembly 35, which operates in a known manner.The cylinder assembly 35, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6, includes a yoke 36 which holds the clinching roller 34.The yoke is appended to a piston rod 37, which slides in and out of the cylinder head 38. The cylinder head 38 is attached to the cylinder barrel 39 by bolts 40.The hydraulic cylinder assembly 35 provides the pressure on the clinching roller 34 to close the lockseam 43. The forming head 21 is secured to the forming head base 23 by the key 24 and bolts 24a. The key 24 allows the forming head to be easily removed. Different size forming heads can be used with the same spiral pipe producing machine 10 to produce spiral seamed pipe of various diameters. The slitter assembly 50 is preferably mounted to the machine base gila. In some instances, however, it may be easier to mount the slitter assembly 50 on an adapter plate which is fastened to the machine base. The slitter assembly 50 includes two pairs of base legs 52. Each opposing pair of base legs 52 is fixed to a plate 52a with bolts 53. The pair of base legs 52 and plate 52a form one solid piece. It is important that opposing base legs are separated by a precise distance and maintain a precise alignment, so that they do not put pressure on the bearing units 58 described below . Each base leg 52 is secured to the machine base lia via bolts 55. These bolts 55 are located within adjustment slots 54. Each base leg 52 is provided with one adjustment slot 54. The four adjustment slots 54 are at right angles to a pivot pin 156. The adjustment slots 54 allow the slitter assembly 50 to be rotated about the pivot pin 156 to align the slitter assembly. Proper angular alignment is necessary to obtain clean, rectangular cuts of the pipe 42. A linear motion bearing unit 58 and rail 59 conbination is attached to the upper, inner face of each base leg 52. The linear motion bearing unit 58 and rail 59 combination used in the present embodiment of the invention is a Slide Pack FBW Series, sold by THK America, Inc., Elk Grove Village, Illinois. The bearing unit 58 includes a mounting plate 58a which is fastened to the base leg 52 by bolts 57. Two ball bearing circuits 58b are located on each mounting plate.The rail 59 mates with ball bearing circuits 58 on two juxta posed base legs 52, and slides across the ball bearings with very little resistance. A linear guide beam 60 is attached to each rail 59 with screws 58c.Thus, the linear guide beams 60 will slide relative to the base legs 52 with very little friction. Two vertical connecting members 63 are fastened to one end of the linear guide beams 60 with threaded bolts 62. The vertical connecting members 63 support the back end of a cantilevered boom 65. The generally cylindrical shaped boom 65 is provided with two recessed, flat surfaces to mate with the vertical connecting members 63. A plurality of bolts 64 fasten the vertical connecting members 63 to the back end of the boom. Note that one of the vertical connecting members 63 is L shaped to provide more clearance for the upper and lower guide plates 19, 20. The diameter of the boom 65 is small enough so that the boom can move laterally through the forming head 21. It is presently preferred that the boom diameter is small enough so that the boom can pass through a four inch diameter pipe. The boom 65 can then be used for any larger diameter pipe as well. It can be seen from FIGS. 3, 5 7, 12a and 12b that the central section of the boom 65 is carved out to varying depths. This is done to allow the boom 65 to pass over the support roller 32, and to provide sufficient clearance for the support arm 22 to move into and out of its clamping position with the support roller 32. Trade offs must be made in the amount of clearance provided for the support roller and support arm, and the amount of material left in the boom to keep it rigid. In a present embodiment of the invention the boom 65 is only 1 8 inch thick at its thinnest point. The front end of the boom 65 is provided with a receptacle 66. The cavity defined by the receptacle holds the upper knife housing 68. The sides of the receptacle can be pried apart to allow the upper knife housing 68 to slide into the receptacle cavity. A slit 66b is provided in the receptacle 66 to facilitate opening the receptacle. The shoulders 66a of the receptacle are pulled together by bolts 67 to lock the upper knife housing 68 into the receptacle 66. A circular, passive knife blade 69 is rotatably mounted in the upper knife blade housing 68. The terms passive or 1 idle mean that the blade may move in response to a tangential force against the cutting edge of the blade, as opposed to actively driving the blade with a motor. The upper knife blade 69 fits within the forming head 21 and the pipe 42. It is preferred that the circumference of the blade is small enough so that it also may fit within four inch diameter pipe. The boom 65 and upper blade 69 are positioned inside the pipe 42 so that their axes are parallel to the the axis of the pipe. The circumferential edge of the blade provides the cutting action. The edge should be located adjacent to the inner pipe surface. It is preferred that the blade edge is almost touching the pipe surface.In the present embodiment of the invention 1 16 mm clearance is used. The edge should not actually touch the pipe, so that it scratches the inner pipe surface and dulls the cutting edge. On the other hand, if the cutting edge is too far above the pipe surface, the pipe will bend towards the upper blade during the cutting process, leaving a wrinkled pipe edge. A second circular, passive knife blade 70 is positioned outside of the pipe. The blade is rotatably mounted in a lower knife housing 71, which is mounted on a lower knife guide assembly 73. The lower knife guide assembly 73 and lower knife guide housing 71 should position the lower knife blade 70 so that its axis is parallel to the pipe axis and the axis of the upper knife blade 69. The circumferential cutting edge of the lower blade 70 should be adjacent to the the circumferential edge of the upper blade 69 in a lateral position. In the preferred embodiment, the cutting edges of the upper and lower blades are separated by .002 .004 in the lateral direction. Ideally, the lateral clearance between the upper and lower knife blades should be 2 5 of the gauge of the metal strip 15.There should be a little clearance between the knife blades to allow the strip material to move to facilitate cutting. However, if the blades are positioned too far apart laterally, the cut will leave burrs and sharp edges on the pipe edge. On the other hand, if the blades are too close together laterally, additional force is required to cut the pipe. The lower blade 70 should be displaced longitudinally from the upper blade 69, so that it is free and clear of the pipe 42 and the cutting edge of the upper blade 69 when no cutting is required. The lower blade 70 is then raised in a vertical direction to penetrate the pipe and initiate the cutting process to be explained below . The lower knife guide assembly 73 guides the vertical motion of the lower knife blade 70. See FIGS.8 10 This assembly includes a first guide leg 75 which is secured to a linear guide beam 60 with screws 77.Holes 77a are provided in the first leg 75 for the screws 77. A second leg 84 is attached to the other linear guide beam 60 with more screws 77 and screw holes 77a. An intermediate leg 80 is connected to the second leg 84 with bolts 85. These three legs are made of heat treated steel, hardened to 58 60 Rockwell. Both the first leg 75 and the intermediate leg 80 have integral v shaped tongues 81 facing towards each other.A center section 78, with v shaped slots 79, is adapted to slide up and down on the v shaped tongues 81. Linear v shaped needle bearing strips 87, sold by IKO Bearings,Arlington Heights, It, are placed between the v shaped slots 79 and the v shaped tongues 81 to allow the center section 78 to move with little frictional resistance.A retaining lip is attached to the top and bottom of the v shaped slots 79 to keep the bearing strips 87 in place. Four hex screws 88 are threaded into holes in the second leg 84. The ends of these screws 88 engage the surface of the intermediate leg 80 to apply pressure on the bearing strips 87 between the center section 78 and its two adjacent legs 75 and 80. Tie bar 135, which maintains a precise distance between the linear guide beams 60, also puts force on the bearing strips 87.The pressure on the bearing strips 87 should be adjusted with the hex screws 88, so that there is no play in the lower cutting blade 70, either up and down or side to side. Play in the cutting blade will leave burrs and or bad cuts. The bottom ends of the first leg 75 and the second leg 84 are tied together with a strut 90 and bolts 91. The lower knife housing 71 is placed in a circular cavity 93 in the center section 78 of the lower knife guide assembly 73. The lower knife 70 has an integral shaft 96 which is positioned along the central axis of the cavity 93 of the housing 71. The blade shaft 96 is held in position by a plurality of inner bearing races 98, conical bearings 99, and outer bearing races 97. The conical bearings allow the blade 70 to freely rotate when a tangential force is applied to the circumference of the blade 70. Seeger security rings 100 provide support for the outer races 97. The voids between the conical bearings and their races are filled with grease. Seals 101 are provided at the front and back ends of the housing cavity to keep out dirt and dust. A nut 105, which is threaded on the rear of the blade shaft 96, is turned to adjust the pressure on the bearings 99.The blade 70 should be allowed to freely rotate without any play. A lockwasher 104 is provided to prevent the nut 105 from loosening. A filler ring 103 matches the inner diameter of the back seal 101 and provides support for the back inner races 98. As shown best in FIG. 9, the circular face of the lower knife blade 70 is machined so that its circumferential edge is slightly angled. The circumferential edge should be sharp since it provides the cutting action. The bores 106 in the axial ends of the cutting blade 70 are used to hold the blade while it is being ground, so that the blade shaft 96 and the cutting edge of the blade are perfectly perpendicular and straight. This is done so that the blade does not wobble. Wrench holes 107 are provided in the face of the blade 70 to hold the blade steady while the nut 105 is tightened. The lower knife housing 71 is eccentrically shaped, as best shown in FIG. 8. The knife housing 71 is rotated in the cavity 93 in the center section 78 to adjust the vertical distance between the cutting edge of the lower knife blade 70 and the top of the center section 78. The lower knife housing 71 may also be slid laterally within the cavity 93 to adjust the lateral distance between the cutting edges of the knife blades 69, 70. Hex bolts 111 hold the lower knife housing 71 in position. The bolts 111 are threaded through the holes 112 in the center section 78 and engage the annular recess 110 in the lower knife housing 71. The upper knife housing 68 and upper knife blade 69 are identical to the lower knife housing 71 and lower knife blade 70. These parts are intended to be interchangeable. The upper knife blade housing 68 is positioned in the receptacle 66 on the front end of the boom 65. The eccentric knife housing 68 is rotated within the receptacle to adjust the vertical distance between the cutting edge of the upper knife blade 69 and the bottom of the boom 65. Thus, the distance between the edge of the blade and the inner pipe surface is controlled by the eccentric housing 68. Moreover, the lateral distance between the cutting edges of the knife blades 69, 70 can be adjusted by sliding the upper knife housing 68 laterally within the receptacle 70.The upper knife housing 68 is locked into its desired angular and lateral positions by tightening bolts 67 to pull the shoulders 66a together. The annular recess 110 is not used for the upper knife blade assembly. The center section 78 of the lower knife guide assembly 73, and hence the lower cutting blade 70, are moved vertically with the pneumatic toggle cylinder assembly 115. The present embodiment of the invention uses a two inch diameter, one inch stroke pneumatic cylinder sold by Milwaukee Cylinder Co. This toggle cylinder assembly includes two toggle links 118a,b which are pivotally joined by a central rod 119. The lower toggle link 118a is also pivotally joined to a projection 120, which is integral with the strut 90, via a lower rod 121. The upper link 118b is also pivotally connected to the center knife holder section 78 via an upper rod 122.A yoke 117 is connected to the central rod 119, which joins the two toggle links 118.The yoke 117 is appended to a piston rod 116 which slides in and out of the cylinder barrel 123. A rear yoke 124 is connected to the back end of the cylinder barrel 123.The cylinder barrel 123 is supported by a bar 125 which passes through the rear yoke 124 and slots 126 in two brackets 127. The brackets 127 are attached to the outer guide legs 75 and 84 of the lower knife guide assembly 73 at screw holes 127a see FIG. 10 . Thus, the toggle cylinder assembly 115 is adapted to move in unison with the linear guide beams 60 via the lower knife guide assembly 73. The toggle cylinder assembly 115 operates under pneumatic pressure to move the lower knife blade 70 from its standby position to its cutting position.When the piston rod 116 is fully retracted, the uppermost edge of the lower knife blade 70 should be below the lowermost surface of the forming head 21. SeeFIG. 3 The forming head 21 then can be slid in and out of the forming head base 23, so that the forming head may be changed. The lower knife blade 70 should be in its cutting position when the piston 116 is at the end of its stroke. The toggle links 118a,b then should be locked in vertical alignment. This vertical alignment makes it difficult for the cutting force on the lower knife blade 70 to push down the center knife holder section 78, thereby facilitating cutting of the lockseam, which comprises four layers of the metal strip 15. When the toggle cylinder assembly 115 moves the lower knife blade 70 into cutting position, the circumferential edge of the lower knife blade 70 should puncture the pipe surface and overlap with the circumferential edge of the upper knife blade 69 by approximately 1 32 of an inch See FIG. 11 . The amount of overlap may have to be increased so that the blades do not jump over the lockseam. However, if the blades overlap too much, the edge of the cut pipe may wrinkle. The toggle cylinder assembly 115 should be adjusted to provide the proper degree of blade overlap for cutting when the piston rod 116 is at full stroke and the links 118a,b are vertically aligned. This adjustment may be made with the adjustment lever 130.This lever has an integral threaded shaft 128 and ring 128a. The bar 125 passes through the ring 128a.The threaded shaft 128 passes through a nut 129 and an endpiece 131. The adjustment lever 130 is rotated to move the toggle cylinder assembly 115 in a horizontal direction along the adjustment slots 126 in the support brackets 127. The standby position and the cutting position of the upper toggle link 118b will vary in the vertical direction as the position of the cylinder barrel 123 is varied in the horizontal direction. The vertical standby and cutting positions of the lower knife blade 70 will vary accordingly. If the proper cutting position of the lower knife blade 70 can be achieved with the piston rod 116 at its end of stroke, operator adjustment and mistakes of cutting tolerances can be eliminated. Varying the gauge of the metal strip 15 usually will not require a new adjustment of the cylinder barrel position. An air cylinder assembly 148 is provided to assist lateral movement of the upper and lower knife blades 69 and 70. A cylinder barrel 150 is attached at its back end to a strut 153 by a nut and bolt arrangement 154. The strut 153 is attached to a base leg 52 by two bolts. The piston rod 149 is connected to a support bracket 127 of the toggle cylinder assembly 115 with a clevis 151 and nut and bolt 152. The air cylinder assembly 148 operates to pull and push the bracket 127.Since the bracket 127 is connected to the linear guide beams 60 via the outer legs of the lower knife guide assembly 73, the air cylinder assembly 148 also pulls and pushes the linear guide beams 60 and everything connected thereto, including the upper and lower knife blades 69 and 70. The air cylinder assembly 148 provides friction compression for the linear bearing units 58. The slitter assembly 50 weighs too much to be moved solely by the force of the moving strip 15 after the upper and lower knife blades 69, 70 cut the pipe 42. The air cylinder assembly 148 facilitates free movement of the cutting blades, and parts connected thereto, so that the pipe 42 will rotate through the cutting blades 69, 70 and be completely severed. A wiper assembly 136 is provided to wipe lubricant off the pipe 42 See FIGS. 3, 5, and 13 . A rubber wiper blade 137 is attached to a wiper holder 138, which is positioned within a basin 139. Lubricant which is collected in the basin 139 runs off to drain via a hose not shown connected to the tube 140. The basin 139 is mounted on a vertical support member 142. The support member 142 is attached to the free end of a cantilevered beam 144. The other end of the beam 144 is attached to the end of a linear guide beam 60. Thus, the wiper assembly 136 moves with the linear guide beams 60. The free end of the cantilevered beam has three guide pins 145 in vertical alignment. The vertical support member 142 has a vertical slot which fits around the three guide pins 145. The vertical support member 142 and basin 139 can slide up and down over the guide pins 145, and the guide pins will keep the support member 142 and basin 139 in a vertical orientation. A handle 146 is threaded onto the central guide pin so that it can be turned to lock the vertical support member 142 against the beam 144 to maintain a constant height. An advantage of this wiper assembly 136 is that the wiper blade 137 is positioned underneath the pipe 42. Thus, the wiper can wipe lubricant off any diameter pipe from the same position. Moreover, the wiper works with gravity to remove lubricant from the pipe. The operation of the slitter assembly shown and described above will now be explained, with particular reference to FIGS. 14 and 15. With a few minor exceptions, the dials and switches 14 on the left hand side of the control panel 13 perform the same functions they have performed in the assignee s spiral pipe producing machines which have been on the market for over one year. First, the cutter start and stop buttons have been replaced with slitter start and stop buttons.These buttons can be used to trim the leading edge of the pipe 42 using the slitter assembly 50. The LOW dial still controls the pipe speed during the slow down phase and cutting operation, although the cutting speed is not as dependent on strip thickness and pipe diameter.Second, the low speed override switch is no longer used. The right hand side of the control panel has been changed in light of the slitter assembly 50. The hydraulic gauge 14a is controlled by the dial 14f.When the dial 14f is at a first setting, the hydraulic gauge 14a will indicate the hydraulic pressure on the upper drive roller 18. In a second dial setting, the hydraulic gauge 14a displays the clinching roller 34 pressure. In a third setting the drive motor pressure is read, and in a fourth position the pump pressure is displayed. The drive roller hydraulic relief valve 14c controls the drive roller pressure, and the clinching roller hydraulic relief valve 14d controls the clinching roller pressure. The pneumatic pressure gauge 14b displays the pressure on the friction compensating cylinder assembly 148. The pneumatic relief valve 14e adjusts the pneumatic pressure on the return stroke of the piston rod 149. i.e., during the cutting process . The schematic diagram for the pneumatic control system of the slitter assembly 50, shown in FIG. 15, contains several conventional items which perform in a known manner. For example, the source of air 158 is connected through a filter 159, a pressure regulator 160, and a lubricator 161. Directional valves 162 control the operation of the toggle link cylinder 115, the friction compensating cylinder 148, and a pipe discharge cylinder 163. Spiral seamed pipe is made with the pipe producing machine 10 in a known manner. The metal strip 15 can be fed into the machine 10 and formed into spiral seamed pipe in the manner set forth in my aboveidentified patent application see pages 18 20 . Once the metal strip has been inserted into the machine, the operator starts the mainmotor oil pump by pushing theMAIN button. Next, the LUBRICANT button is pushed to start the lubrication pump. The LOW speed selector is adjusted to set the cutting speed, and the HIGH speed selector is set to adjust the pipe production speed.The operator then selects either manual or automatic operation using the AUTO control knob. When the operator hits the HIGH in the automatic mode, the pipe producing machine 10 will continuously make pipe, and the slitter 50 will continuously cut it into sections. In manual mode the pipe producing machine 10 will continuously make the pipe, and the slitter will automatically cut the pipe into a section, but the pipe producing machine will turn off after the pipe section has been discharged. The present embodiment of the invention runs under a conventional programmable controller. Of course, switches and delay timers could be used instead. Referring now to FIG. 15, as the metal strip 15 is formed into spiral seamed pipe 42, the pipe 42 spirally rotates and moves forward laterally. When the outer edge 166 of the pipe hits a first limit switch 167, the upper drive roller 18 slows down. Hence, the pipe 42 moves more slowly. When the pipe 42 next hits the second limit switch 168, the pipe producing machine turns the upper drive roller off, and the pipe 42 stops moving.Air is then supplied to the toggle link cylinder 115 to raise the lower knife blade 70. The lower knife blade is raised until its circumferential edge overlaps the circumferential edge of the upper knife blade and punctures the pipe 42. Restricted orifices and check valves 169 are provided on the inlet and outlet lines of the toggle cylinder assembly 115, so the lower knife guide assembly 73 does not rise or fall too fast. After a 1 2 second delay, the upper drive roller 18 starts again on slow speed, and the friction compensating cylinder 148 reverses direction. Thus, the pipe 42 starts moving forward and spirally rotating again. However, the pipe 42 will rotate between the overlapping upper and lower knife blades 69, 70. The rotating pipe turns the overlapping knife blades 69, 70 so that they cooperate to cut the pipe as it rotates.The knife blades 69 and 70, and the components of the slitter assembly attached thereto e.g., the boom 65, the lower knife guide assembly 73, the linear guide beams 60, and the toggle link cylinder assembly 115 will move in the direction of the pipe, due to the moving pipe pushing on the cutting blades and the pulling action of the friction compensation cylinder assembly 115.After one full rotation of the pipe 42, the pipe should be completely cut rectangularly i.e., perpendicular to the axis of the pipe by the upper and lower knife blades. The friction compensating air cylinder 115 operates under low pressure on its return pull stroke. This pressure is controlled by a pressure relief valve 170, which is adjusted using the pneumatic control knob 14e on the control panel 13. The dashed line 170a represents the relief line. The pulling pressure must be adjusted to compensate for any frictional resistance in the linear bearing units 58. The pressure in the cylinder 115 should balance the friction in the bearings so that the cutting blades 69,70 will move laterally at the touch of a finger. This pressure balance can be obtained by manually adjusting the cylinder pressure while pushing on the boom 65, or automatically with valves. The pressure compensating cylinder 115 allows the cutting blades and attached components to move with the pipe, as if there were no frictional resistance to such movement so that the cutting blades were moving only under the force of the moving pipe. In order to achieve a clean, rectangular cut of the pipe, it is important that the cutting blades 69, 70, and all parts attached thereto, are properly aligned and move as if there were no friction. It is also important that the cutting blades have the proper clearances and no play. If everything is not properly adjusted, the cut may not be rectangular. Instead, the cut could be spirally configured, so that the starting point and end point of the cut do not meet. High pressure is used to return push the pressure compensating cylinder 115 back to its starting position, since the extension stroke of piston rod 149 is not as sensitive. A pressure relief valve 171 is used to adjust this pressure. The relief valve 171 and pressure gauge 171a are located inside the control cabinet 12. A check valve and restricted orifice 169 are used to dampen the high pressure return. The slitter assembly 50 continues to move with the pipe until the slitter assembly contacts a third limit switch 173. This limit switch is placed at a position at which any size diameter pipe made with the pipe producing machine 10 and slitter assembly 50 would complete one rotation, so that the cut will be complete. The limit switch 173 should actually provide for a little overlap in the cut. If the cut is not quite complete, two sections of pipe will be attached by a sliver of metal. Pipe ranging from 4 inch to 24 inch diameters will complete one rotation in approximately 5 1 2 inches of lateral movement. The pipe producing machine 10 then stops again.The toggle cylinder 115 is lowered to the standby position. After a short time delay the friction compensating cylinder 148 reverses direction, and returns the cutting blades 69, 70 to their starting position. Next, the pipe discharge cylinder 163 raises arms 175 to discharge the cut section of pipe onto a run off table. Check valves and restricted orifices 169 are provided so that the discharge arms 175 are raised and lowered slowly and gently. When the discharge arms 175 return they will close a fourth limit switch 176.The pipe producing machine 10 will not start again until this limit switch has been closed. If the pipe producing machine 10 is in automatic mode and the fourth limit switch 176 closes, the machine 10 and slitter 50 will automatically repeat the above process for forming and slitting pipe. If in manual mode, the operator must hit the HIGH button to repeat the above process for one more section of pipe. It follows from the foregoing description that the present invention provides several advantages over high speed saw blades for cutting hollow metal pipe. The cutting blades of the present invention use a shearing action, like scissors, to cut the pipe. The pipe is cut without the sparks, noise and danger of a high speed saw blade. Thus, the present invention provides a safer environment for manufacturing spiral seamed pipes. Further, the cutting process of the present invention does not leave burrs on the ends of the cut pipe sections. This increases the efficiency of the pipe forming process because manpower does not have to be utilized to de burr the cut pipes. Still further, the cutting apparatus of the present invention may be easily adapted to existing spiral pipe producing machines. It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the preferred embodiment described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art.For example, the preferred embodiment of the invention uses idle, rotatable knife blades. It is possible that the same type of knife blades could be driven with a motor, although that would defeat some of the advantages of the invention. It is intended that the foregoing description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, which are intended to define the scope of the invention.
