## Description
Process for the separation of isobutylene from a normal C4 hydrocarbon It is highly desirable to obtain an isobutylenerich product, because that butene is useful in gasoline blending and subsequent reactions to produce, for example, butyl rubber and lubricating oil additives. Crystalline aluminosilicates are known in the art to be useful for separating hydrocarbons. Especially, some Type X orType Y zeolites have been disclosed which have utility in the separation of olefins from paraffinic hydrocarbons and the separation of butene 1 from isobutylene seeUS A 3,723,561 Priegnitz and 4,119,678 Neuzil et al .Zeolites, however, have the propensity to cause dimerization or even polymerization of olefins and are thus not well suited for use as an adsorbent for the separation of isobutylene from normal C4 hydrocarbons. We have found that silicalite is able to effect the separation of normal C4 hydrocarbons from isobutylene with substantially complete elimination of the aforementioned undesired side effects of dimerization and polymerization, particularly when pentene l is used to displace the normal C4 hydrocarbons from the silicalite. According to the present invention a process for separating isobutylene from a feed containing isobutylene and at least one normal C4 hydrocarbon comprises contacting the feed at retention conditions with a zeolite free molecular sieve comprising silicalite to effect selective retention of the normal C4 hydrocarbon, removing the isobutylene from contact with the molecular sieve and recoyering the normal C4 hydrocarbon by displacement from the molecular sieve with a displacement fluid comprising pentene l at displacement conditions. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a process for separating isobutylene from a feed containing isobutylene and at least one normal C4 hydrocarbon using a zeolite free molecular sieve comprising silicalite, which process comprises the steps of a maintaining net fluid flow through a column of the molecular sieve in a single direction, which column contains at least three separate and serially interconnected zones b maintaining a retention zone defined by the feed inlet and raffinate outlet as a downstream boundary c maintaining a purification zone defined by an extract outlet and the feed inlet as a downstream boundary d maintaining a displacement zone defined by a displacement fluid inlet and said extract outlet as a downstream boundary e passing the feed into the retention zone at retention conditions and retaining the normal C4 hydrocarbon and withdrawing a raffinate stream containing isobutylene f passing a displacement material comprising pentene l into the displacement zone at displacement conditions and displacing the normal C4 hydrocarbon from the molecular sieve g withdrawing an extract stream comprising the normal C4 hydrocarbon and displacement fluid from the displacement zone and, h periodically advancing through the column of molecular sieve in a downstream direction with respect to fluid flow the feed inlet, raffinate outlet, displacement fluid inlet, and extract outlet to shift zones through the molecular sieve. In the context of the present invention a feed mixture 1 is a mixture containing one or more extract components and one or more raffinate components to be separated by the process. The term feed stream indicates a stream of a feed mixture which passes to the molecular sieve used in the process. An extract compon end 1 is a compound or type of compound that is more selectively retained by the molecular sieve while a raffinate component is a compound or type of compound that is less selectively retained. In this invention, normalC4 hydrocarbons are extract components and isobutylene is the raffinate component. The term displacement material or fluid means a material capable of displacing an extract component.The term displacing stream or displacement fluid input stream indicates a stream by which displacement material passes to the molecular sieve. The term raffinate stream or raffinate output stream means a stream through which a raffinate component is removed from the molecular sieve. The composition of the raffinate stream can vary from essentially 100 displacement material to essentially 100 raffinate components. The term extract stream or extract output stream means a stream through which an extract material which has been displaced by a displacement material is removed from the molecular sieve. The composition of the extract stream, likewise, can vary from essentially 100 displacement material to essentially 100 extract components. In a preferred method of practising the process of the invention at least a portion of the extract stream and preferably at least a portion of the raffinate stream from the separation process are passed to separation means, typically fractionators, where at least a portion of displacement material is separated to produce an extract product and a raffinate product. The terms extract product and raffinate product mean products produced by the process containing, respectively, an extract component and a raffinate component in higher concentrations than those found in the extract stream and the raffinate stream.Although it is possible by the process of this invention to produce a high purity isobutylene product at high recoveries, it will be appreciated that an extract component is never completely adsorbed by the adsorbent, nor is a raffinate component completely nonadsorbed by the adsorbent. Therefore, varying amounts of a raffinate component can appear in the extract stream and, likewise, varying amounts of an extract component can appear in the raffinate stream.The extract and raffinate streams then are further distinguished from each other and from the feed mixture by the ratio of the concentrations of an extract component and a raffinate component appearing in the particular stream. More specifically, the ratio of the concentration of a normal C4 hydrocarbon to that of less selectively retained isobutylene will be lowest in the raffinate stream, next highest in the feed mixture, and the highest in the extract stream. Likewise, the ratio of the concentration of less selectively retained isobutylene to that of a more selectively retained normal C4 hydrocarbon will be highest in the raffinate stream, next highest in the feed mixture, and the lowest in the extract stream. The term selective pore volume of the molecular sieve is defined as the volume of the molecular seive which selectively retains an extract component from the feed mixture. The term non selective void volume of the molecular sieve is the volume of the molecular sieve which does not selectively retain an extract component from the feed mixture. This volume includes the cavities of the molecular sieve which are capable of retaining raffinate components and the interstitial void spaces between molecular sieve particles. The selective pore volume and the non selective void volume are generally expressed in volumetric quantities and are of importance in determining the proper flow rates of fluid required to be passed into an operational zone for efficient operations to take place for a given quantity of molecular sieve. When molecular sieve passes into an operational zone hereinafter defined and described employed in one embodiment of this process its non selective void volume together with its selective pore volume carries fluid into that zone. The non selective void volume is utilized in determining the amount of fluid which should pass into the same zone in a countercurrent direction to the molecular sieve to displace the fluid present in the non selective void volume. If the fluid flow rate passing into a zone is smaller than the non selective void volume rate of molecular sieve material passing into that zone, there is a net entrainment of liquid into the zone by the molecular sieve. Since this net entrainment is a fluid present in the non selective void volume of the molecular sieve, it in most instances comprises less selectively retained feed components. Feed stocks which can be utilized in the process of this invention can be derived from any of the refinery processes known to the art. Specifically, the feed stocks include C4 mono olefinic hydrocarbons such as butene1, isobutylene, trans butene 2 and cis butene 2. The term butene 2 includes both the cis and trans isomer configuration of that hydrocarbon. Other materials can be present in the feed stock such as large quantities of paraffinic or napthene substances and in some instances low concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons other than benzene and other contaminant substances such as the combined sulfur nitrogen compounds. It is preferred, however, to substantially reduce the quantity of components which would contribute to the deactivation of the molecular sieves by blocking off the selective pore passageways to feed stock components. Specific feed stocks which can be utilized in the process of this invention include a feed stock containing about 35 vol. butene 1, 32.5 vol. isobutylene and 32.5 vol. isobutane. Other feed stock compositions include feed stocks containing approximately 21 vol. butene1, 21 vol. isobutylene, 16 vol. trans butene 2, 16 vol. cis butene 2 with remaining feed stock components comprising a butane component such as isobutane or normal butane. The feed stock can contain other paraffinic substances having higher molecular weight such as heptane or hexanes or octanes or nonanes or higher molecular weight paraffins. It is preferred to utilize feedstocks having more than about 15 vol. total olefins. Nonnormal hydrocarbons other than isobutylene, such as isobutane, will be rejected by the silicalite adsorbent and comprise part of the raffinate stream along with the isobutylene. This presents no problem if pure isobutylene is desired, since such hydrocarbons are easily separated from isobutylene by conventional means of distillation. The difficult separation is that of isobutylene from the normal hydrocarbons, particularly normal olefins, and that separation is accomplished by the present invention. Desorbent materials or displacement fluids used in various prior art separation processes vary depending upon such factors as the type of operation employed.In connection with the nature and function of desorbents attention is directed to the passage in GB A 2049667 from page 4 line 45 to page 5 line 7, which is incorporated herein by reference. We have found that a displacement material comprising pentene l is particularly effective in the process of the present invention, especially where operated as an isothermal, isobaric, liquid phase process. It is usually advantageous to mix pentene l with a diluent not selectively retained by the molecular sieve such as isooctane or cyclohexane. Preferably the displacement fluid contains from about 10 to about 90 LV liquid volume pentene 1. The molecular sieve to be used in the process of this invention comprises silicalite. As previously mentioned, silicalite is a hydrophobic crystalline silica molecular sieve. Due to its aluminum free structure, silicalite does not show ion exchange behaviour, and is hydrophobic and organophilic. Silicalite thus comprises a molecular sieve, but not the hydrated aluminum or calcium silicate comprising a zeolite. Silicalite is uniquely suitable for the separation process of this invention for the presumed reason that its pores are of a size and shape that enable the silicalite to function as a molecular sieve, i.e. accept the molecules of normalC4 hydrocarbons into its channels or internal structure, while rejecting the molecules of isobutylene.A detailed discussion of silicalite may be found in the article Silicalite, A New Hydrophobic Crystalline Silica Molecular Sieve Nature, Vol. 271, 9 February 1978, incorporated herein by reference. The molecular sieve may be employed in the form of a dense compact fixed bed which is alternately contacted with the feed mixture and with displacement material. In the simplest embodiment of the invention, the molecular sieve is employed in the form of a single static bed in which case the process is only semi continuous.In another embodiment, a set of two or more static beds may be employed in fixed bed contacting with appropriate valving so that the feed mixture is passed through one or more molecular sieve beds, while the displacement materials can be passed through one or more of the other beds in the set. The flow of feed mixture and displacement materials may be either up or down through the displacement fluid. Any of the conventional apparatus employed in static bed fluid solid contacting may be used. The particles of silicalite molecular sieve preferably have a particle size range of about 16 60 mesh Standard U.S. Mesh . Silicalite itself is a fine powder and therefore must be bound to obtain the above particle size. An inorganic oxide such as alumina is an acceptable binder, although a fluid permeable organic polymer is at least as effective, particularly polystyrenedivinylbenzene. The organic polymer offers the further advantage of greater resistance to dissolution of the molecular sieve. Countercurrent moving bed or simulated moving bed countercurrent flow systems have a much greater separation efficiency than fixed molecular sieve bed systems and are therefore preferred. In the moving bed or simulated moving bed processes, the retention and displacement operations are continuously taking place which allows both continuous production of an extract and a raffinate stream and the continual use of feed and displacement fluid streams. One preferred embodiment of this process utilizes what is known in the art as the simulated moving bed countercurrent flow system. The operating principles and sequence of such a flow system, are described in the passage at page 8 line 53 to page 10 line 10 of GB A 2049667, which passage is incorporated herein by reference. Reference can be made to US A 2,985,589 and to a paper entitled Continuous Adsorptive Processing ANew Separation Technique by D.B. Broughton presented at the 34th Annual Meeting of the Society of ChemicalEngineers at Tokyo, Japan on April 2, 1969, both incorporated herein by reference, for further explanation of the simulated moving bed countercurrent process flow scheme. Although both liquid and vapour phase operations can be used in many adsorptive or molecular sieve separation processes, liquid phase operation is preferred for this process because of the lower temperature requirements and because of the higher yields of extract product that can be obtained with liquid phase operation over those obtained with vapour phase operation. Retention conditions suitably include a temperature in the range of from about 200C to about 2000C, with about 200C to about 1000C being more preferred, and a pressure sufficient to maintain liquid phase. Displacement conditions suitably include the same range of temperatures and pressures as used for retention conditions. The size of the units which can utilize the process of this invention can vary anywhere from those of pilotplant scale see for example US A 3,706,812 to those of commercial scale and can range in flow rates from as little as a few cc an hour up to many thousands of litres per hour. The following example is presented to illustrate the process of this invention. The example is not intended to unduly restrict the scope and spirit of the claims attached hereto.EXAMPLE In this Example the pulse test apparatus described in GB A 2049667 in the passage at page 6 line 13 46, which passage is incorporated herein by reference, was used to test the ability of inorganic oxide bound silicalite to separate isobutylene from a mixture of isobutylene, n butane, cis and trans butene 2 and butene 1. Two tests were run. In the first test the molecular sieve used was alumina bound silicalite, the displacement fluid was isooctane followed by a hexene l and isooctane mixture in the ratio of 60 40, respectively, the column temperature was 500C and the feed stream pulse was 10 ml of a mixture of the C4 isomers in isooctane.In the second test the molecular sieve used was clay bound silicalite, the displacement fluid was a 50 50 mixture of pentene1 and cyclohexane in accordance with the present invention , the column temperature was 600C and the feed stream pulse was 10 ml of a mixture of the C4 isomers in displacement fluid. The reason why displacement in the first test was initiated with isooctane was to demonstrate at the onset that the separation was a molecular sieve action, i.e.all C4 components of the feed other than the isobutylene were retained in the silicalite pores while the isobutyl ene remained in the void spaces from which it was easily flushed. The aspect of the tests of immediate interest was the relative ability of the hexene l or pentene l in Tests 1 and 2, respectively, to displace the retainedC4 components from the silicalite. The column temperature difference in the two tests is not considered to have a significant effect on the results. The results obtained from Tests 1 and 2 are presented in the following Table and Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings which comprise the elution curves generated by pulse Tests 1 and 2, respectively.

The data in the Table and the curves in the Figures show the superior rate at which the pentepe l effects displacement of the retained components evident by lower retention volumes and half widths as well as the fact of complete and clean displacement of such components achieved by pentene l as compared to the severe tailings experienced through use of the hexene 1. The effectiveness of the present invention is thus clearly illustrated.
