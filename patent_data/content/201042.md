## Description
The present invention relates new steroid compounds as important intermediates for the synthesis of brassinosteroids as well as a process for preparing same. More particularly, the present invention relates to new 3α,5 cyclo 22,23 dihydroxy 5α steroid compounds of the general formula The definitions of the various substituents are given below. Brassinosteroids such as brassinolide are compounds with a plant growth regulating activity see Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 101 1984 , 36008 ℓ. Brassinolide was isolated in 1979 from pollens of According to the Siddall et al. process shown in Scheme 1, a known 3 hydroxy 5 The starting 3 hydroxy 5 The process of Siddall et al. comprised of 4 steps for preparing the compound of the formula XV a from the compound of the formula XIII involves in the step for preparing the compound XXI from the compound of the formula XX the use of diborane which is expensive and cumbersome to handle. Thus, the process of Siddall et al. is not suitable as a synthetic process for brassinolide on an industrial scale. Further, a number of processes are proposed for the synthesis of brassinolide from stigmasterol not via the route of the compound of formula XV a. Among the known references aforementioned, for example, the latter four references disclose the routes for the synthesis of brassinolide not via the compound of the formula XV a. However, these known processes involve a number of steps and afford brassinolide in a very low yield. Up to the present, the process of Mori et al. comprised of 16 steps in all is regarded to be the best process and affords brassinolide in the maximum total yield as high as 3 . Thus, there is a necessity in the synthesis of brassinolide and its analogues to make further improvement in these known processes for reducing the number of the steps thereby increasing the total yield of brassinolide. For this purpose, it is necessary to find a new route for reducing the number of the steps over the whole or part of the process for synthesizing brassinolide from stigmasterol. Starting from stigmasterol, a number of processes, including the process of Siddall et al., are known for the synthesis of the compound of the formula XIII which is an intermediate for the synthesis of brassinolide through a route wherein the compound of the formula XV a is prepared. However, these known processes involve steps wherein the reaction is complicate or difficult and the yield of the product is poor, and are not satisfactory for a process to be carried out on an industrial scale. For the synthesis of brassinosteroids in a more economical manner and in a smaller number of steps, there is a great demand in the field of this art for improving the steps hardly operable on an industrial scale in the prior art processes or developing a new route for synthesizing brassinosteroids which can be carried out economically and industrially. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide new steroidal compounds useful as intermediates for the synthesis of brassinosteroids. It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and advantageous process for preparing intermediates for the synthesis of brassinosteroids, whereby the number of the steps in a process for synthesizing brassinosteroids is rendered smaller so that the process may be carried out economically. As a result of extensive research for developing an industrially advantageous process for synthesizing brassinosteroids, it has now been found that the prior art process for preparing the compound of the formula XV a from the compound of the formula XIII via the compound of the formula XXI according to Siddall et al. which involves a step unsuited for being carried out industrially can be replaced with a new process passing through a new route involving industrially advantageous steps. Further, it has also been found that the prior art process for preparing the compound of the formula XIII from stigmasterol can be substituted by a new efficient process passing through a different route involving specific short circuit steps and that new intermediate steroidal compounds can be prepared from a certain known compound obtained on the way of synthesizing brassinosteroids according to the prior art process and a new industrially advantageous route for synthesizing brassinolide can be established from the new intermediate steroidal compounds.

In further aspect of this embodiment, there is provided a process for the preparation of a 3α,5 cyclo 22,23 substituted dihydroxyl 5α steroid compound of the general formula wherein X is a hydroxyl group and Y is a hydrogen atom or X and Y, taken together, form an oxo group, each R⁴ is an acyl group, a silyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group or a benzyl group, the stereo configuration at the 22 and 23 positions being either 22R and 23R, or 22S and 23S, which comprises treating stigmasterol after mesylation at the 3 position with a mesyl halide and an acid binding agent to protect the 3β hydroxyl group, with benzyl alcohol, a polar solvent and a weak base to form 24S ethyl 3α,5 cyclo 6β benzyloxy 5α cholest 22 ene, reacting it with ozone in the presence of a weak base and then with a dialkyl sulfide to form 3α,5 cyclo 6β benzyloxy 20S formyl 5α pregnane, reacting the pregnane with lithium isobutyne 1 under super cooling to form 3α,5 cyclo 6β benzyloxy 22R hydroxy 5α cholest 23 yne, catalytically hydrogenating the cholest 23 yne in the presence of P2 nickel catalyst to form the corresponding cholest 23 ene compound, reacting the latter with a peroxide to form 22R,23S,24R 3α,5 cyclo 6β benzyloxy 22 hydroxy 23,24 epoxy 5α cholestane, reacting the epoxy compound with trimethyl aluminum and n butyl lithium under super cooling to form 3α,5 cyclo 22R,23R dihydroxy 6β benzyloxy 5α cholest 24 ene, reacting the cholestene with a reagent capable of converting the 22,23 dihydroxyl groups to OR⁴ groups other than the hydroxyl groups to form the corresponding 22,23 di OR cholest 24 ene compound, and thereafter subjecting the latter compound to catalytic hydrogenation to form a 3α,5 cyclo 22,23 di OR cholestan 6β ol and optionally reacting the resultant 6β ol compound with an oxidizing agent. In the above processes, the free hydroxyl group or groups are often protected with the group R such as an acyl group which can easily split off by hydrolysis. In some cases, the free hydroxyl group or groups can be protected with a tosyl or mesyl group as a sulfonic ester group. For the purpose of protecting the free hydroxyl group, therefore, such sulfonic ester group can be incorporated into the category of acyl groups. Among the new compounds of the present invention, the compound of the general formula B wherein the two radicals R are combined together to form a isopropylidenedioxy group, i.e. the compound of the formula I a is one of the useful intermediate products for brassinolide and its analogues and can be used directly for the preparation of the compound of the formula XV a in one step. Thus, the compound of the formula XV a which can be converted to brassinolide according to the Ikekawa et al. process can be prepared according to the present invention from the compound of the formula XIII without any difficulty in the operations in less expensive manner as compared with the aforesaid Siddall et al. process. As compounds similar in structure to the known compound of the formula XV a, there are two new compounds of the following formulas XV c and XV g wherein Ac stands for acetyl group. The new compound of the formula XV c can directly be derived from the new compound of the present invention represented by the formula I c in one step and constitutes an important intermediate for the synthesis of 22,23 diacetyl brassinolide. It is also an intermediate, like the above compound of the formula XV a , for the synthesis of brassinolide. The new compound of the formula XV g can directly be derived from the new compounds of the present invention represented by the formula I g in one step and also constitutes an important intermediate for the synthesis of brassinone. Accordingly, the new compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula A including the 3α,5 cyclo 6 one compounds of the general formula B and the 3α,5 cyclo 6β ol compounds of the general formula C are useful as intermediates for brassinolide and its analogues. The new compounds of the present invention can be prepared from the known starting material or intermediate products for brassinolide or its analogues according to methods known per se. The routes of preparing the new compounds of the present invention are shown in the following Schemes 2 6, with the process i for preparing the compounds of the general formula D being shown in Scheme 2, the process ii for preparing the compounds of the general formula D being shown in Schemes 3 the latter half of the process and 6 the former half of the process , the process iii for preparing the compounds of the general formula B being shown in Scheme 4 and the process iv for preparing the compounds of the formula D being shown in Schemes 5 the latter half of the process and 6 the former half of the process In the process i shown in Scheme 2, the compounds of the formulas XIII , XIV and XV a are known except the compounds of this invention represented by the formulas II a and I a . For brevity, the compound of the formula XIII , for example, will be referred to hereinafter simply as the compound XIII . In the process i , the starting compound XIII which can be prepared according to either the known Siddall et al. process or the new process of the present invention in a better yield as shown in Scheme 6 is first mesylated to protect the 3β free hydroxyl group. The compound XIII is dissolved in a proper solvent and a methanesulfonyl halide is added together with an acid binding agent to the solution. Methyl ethyl ketone or acetone is preferably used as the solvent and a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyridine is used as the acid binding agent. By this reaction mesylation , the corresponding 3β mesyloxy compound XIV is obtained at a high yield. The compound XIV is then dissolved in an aqueous organic solvent such as a mixture of water and a water miscible inert solvent, e.g. acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and is treated according to the new process of this invention with a weak inorganic base whereby the new compound II a having a specific 3α 5 cyclic structure and 6β hydroxy group is obtained. Preferable examples of the weak inorganic base include alkali metal carbonates and bicarbonates such as potassium carbonate or bicarbonate and sodium carbonate or bicarbonate. The resultant 22R,23R,24S 3α 5, cyclo 22,23 isopropylidenedioxy 24 methyl 5α cholestan 6β ol II a can optionally be oxidized in a solvent with Jones reagent CrO₃ H₂SO₄ to prepare the corresponding 6 one compound I a , i.e. 22R,23R,24S 3α,5 cyclo 22,23 isopropylidenedioxy 24 methyl 5α cholestan 6 one. Illustrative of the solvent used in the oxidation reaction are, for example, a lower alkyl acetate such as ethyl acetate and a ketone such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone. The compound I a thus obtained can be converted to the known compound XV a advantageously according to the new isomerization method of the present invention as will be detailed hereinafter with respect to Scheme 7. The compound XV a can be converted in turn to brassinolide via castasterone according to the prior art process. In comparison with the prior art process as shown in Scheme 1, the process of this invention as shown in Scheme 2 affords the compound of the formula XV a in an approximately same yield but is extremely advantageous and economical since the process of this invention does not require the use of a special reagent diborane which is expensive and cumbersome to handle. Thus, the present invention is of high significance in establishing an industrially advantageous process for synthesizing brassinolide and its analogues from the compound XIII . In the process ii shown in Schemes 3 and 6, the compounds of this invention represented by the formulas II a , II b , II c , I a and I c can be prepared from the known starting compound stigmasterol III through a new route. In these Schemes, the compounds VIA , VIB , VIIA , VIIB , VIIIA , VIIIB , IXA , IXB , XB , XVIB a and XVIB c are new compounds. In these Schemes, acetyl group and acetonide group are given merely as examples for the simplest cases for R as substituents in 22 and 23 positions. According to the process ii , stigmasterol III is first mesylated to protect the 36 free hydroxyl group in such manner that stigmasterol is dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and a methanesulfonyl halide is added to the solution together with a tertiary amine such as triethylamine as an acid binding agent to prepare the corresponding 3β mesylate. This mesylation per se can be carried out in a conventional manner. The 3β mesyloxy stigmasterol IV is dissolved in a polar solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or DMF and a weak inorganic base and methanol or benzyl alcohol are added as reactants whereby 24S ethyl 3α,5 cyclo 6β methyloxy or benzyloxy 5α cholest 22 ene VA or VB is obtained. The same compounds as mentioned in the preparation of the compound II a in the process i can be used as the weak inorganic base. The compound VA or VB is then dissolved in a proper solvent such as methylene chloride, and methanol and KHCO₃ or NaHCO₃ are added to the solution. The mixture is then cooled below 60 c and ozone is blown into the solution and then treated with methyl sulfide. The resultant 3α,5 cyclo 6β methyloxy or benzyloxy 20S formyl 5α pregnane VIA or VIB is then reacted under super cooling below 60 C, preferably between 60 C and 70 C with lithium isopentyne 1 formed This cholest 23 ene compound is then treated under cooling with a peroxide to form the corresponding 23S,24R epoxide IXA or IXB which can be purified by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate and n hexane as eluent. The epoxide IXA or IXB is then treated under super cooling 70 C with trimethylaluminum and n butyl lithium to form 22R,23R,24S 3α,5 cyclo 6β methoxy or benzyloxy 22,23 dihydroxy 24 methyl 5α cholestane XA or XB which can be purified by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate n hexane. In this case, 22R,23R 3α,5 cyclo 6β methoxy or benzyloxy 22,23 dihydroxy 5α cholest 24 ene XIA or XIB is obtained as a by product. The compound XIA or XIB can be separated from the compound XA or XB by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate n hexane. The known compound XA having 6β methoxy group obtained in the former half of the new process of this invention as shown in Scheme 6 can then be used in the prior art process for preparing the compound XIII which is the starting material for the process 1 . More precisely, the compound XA is treated with p toluenesulfonic acid in dioxane according to the prior art process whereby 22R,23R,24S 3β,22,23 trihydroxy 24 methyl cholest 5 ene XII is obtained. The compound XII is then reacted in an organic solvent such as chloroform with a dialkylketone dialkylacetal such as acetone dimethylacetal and a small amount of p toluenesulfonic acid to prepare the compound XIII . On the other hand, the new compound XB having 6β benzyloxy group obtained in the former half of the new process of this invention as shown in Scheme 6 is then reacted in the latter half of the new process as shown in Scheme 3 with a reagent capable of introducing the desired R³ into the 22 and 23 positions of the end compound. In case a compound wherein two R³ radicals combined together to form an alkylidene group is to be obtained, the compound XB is dissolved in a proper solvent such as chloroform or methylene chloride and reacted with a dialkylketone dialkylacetal such as acetone dimethylacetal in the presence of a small amount of p toluenesulfonic acid to form the compound XVIB a , which is then dissolved in an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofuran and subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd C or Pt black whereby the benzyl group in the 6β position is split off to form the compound II a . In case a compound wherein each R³ radical is an acyl group is to be obtained, the compound XB is dissolved in a proper organic solvent and reacted with an acylating agent in the presence of an acid binding agent. Thus, the use of a tertiary amine such as pyridine is preferable as the solvent as it has dual functions of a solvent and an acid binding agent. In case of R³ being acetyl group, the compound XB is dissolved in pyridine, and acetic anhydride and N,N dimethylaminopyridine are added for acetylation. In case a compound wherein each R³ radical is a silyl group is to be obtained, the compound XB is dissolved in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, and a proper silylating agent and an acid binding agent are added. One of the preferable silylating agents is dimethyl t butyl silyl chloride. A preferable acid binding agent jointly used with the silylating agent is imidazole. In case a compound wherein each R³ radical is a carbonyl group or an alkoxycarbonyl group is to be obtained, phosgen or a dialkyl carbonate such as diethyl carbonate can be used in place of the above mentioned acylating agent R³ carbonyl or alternatively, an alkoxycarbonyl halide such as t butoxy carbonyl chloride widely used in the field of polypeptide chemistry can be used in place of the above mentioned acylating agent in the same manner. In case a compound wherein each R³ radical is a benzyl group is to be otained, the compound XB is dissolved in a polar organic solvent and reacted with sodium hydride and then with a benzyl halide such as benzyl chloride. In this case, a dialkylacylamide such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide or dimethylacetamide is preferably employed as the polar solvent. In Scheme 3, only two cases wherein the free hydroxyl groups in the 22 and 23 positions are acetonized i.e. R is an alkylidene group or acetylated i.e. R is an acetyl group are shown as the compounds XVIB a and XVIB c , respectively. The compound XVIB c having desired OR³ groups in the 22 and 23 positions can thus be prepared. As in the case of preparing the compound II a , the compound XVIB c is then dissolved in a suitable organic solvent as mentioned above and subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst as mentioned above whereby the benzyl group in the 6β position is split off to form the corresponding 6β hydroxy compound II c . It is also possible to subject the compound XB to the catalytic hydrogenolysis in the same manner as described above whereby the corresponding trihydroxyl compound II b can be obtained. The compounds II a and II c thus obtained can optionally be oxidized to the corresponding 6 one compounds I a and I c . This oxidation can be carried out by dissolving the compound II a or II c in a proper organic solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or ethyl acetate and treating the compound with Jones reagent CrO₃ H₂SO₄ under cooling as shown in Schemes 2,3 and 4. In the process iii , the known compound XVII used as the starting material for preparing the end compounds of the general formula B can be prepared from the compound IV according to a variant of the method for preparing the compound VA or VB followed by oxidation as shown in Scheme 6 Agric. Biol. Chem. The process iii is shown in Scheme 4 wherein the compound XVII is dissolved in an aqueous organic solvent such as a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water and is treated with osmium tetraoxide and N methylmorpholine oxide whereby the 22,23 double bond of the compound XVII is attacked to form 22S,23S,24S 3α,5 cyclo 22,23,dihydroxy 24 ethyl 5α cholestan 6 one I d . This compound I d can then be reacted optionally with a reagent capable of converting the hydroxyl groups in the 22 and 23 positions to OR groups other than the hydroxyl group. This reaction itself can be carried as a rule in the same manner as described above with respect to the preparation of the compound XVIB a or c . Thus, the reagent used in this optional reaction can be selected from the various reactants used for converting the hydroxy groups in 22 and 23 positions in the compound XVIB a or XVIB c to the desired OR³ groups. The compounds of the general formula B thus obtained are useful as valuable intermediates for the preparation of S,S homobrassinolides. In the process iv for preparing the compounds of the general formula D from stigmasterol, a series of the reactions proceed along the route as shown in Schemes 5 and 6. In the process iv , the former half of the process as shown in Scheme 6 is carried in the same manner as described above with respect to the process ii , starting with stigmasterol III . When the compound IXA or IXB is reacted in an inert solvent such as n hexane with trimethylaluminum and n butyl lithium to obtain the compound XA or XB in the process ii , 3α,5 cyclo 22R, 23R dihydroxy 6β methoxy or benzyloxy 5α cholest 22 ene XIA or XIB is obtained as a by product together with the compound XA or XB . The compound XIA or XIB can be separated from the compound XA or XB by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate n hexane as eluent. In the latter half of the process iv as shown in Scheme 5, the compound XIB is reacted with a reagent capable of converting the free hydroxyl groups in the 22 and 23 positions to OR⁴ groups in the same manner as described above with respect to the process ii for conversion of the free hydroxyl groups to OR³ groups except for the case of two R³ radicals being combined together to form an alkylidene group. As a mere example, Scheme 5 shows the case of R⁴ being an acetyl group, but R⁴ is not limited only to acetyl group. The resultant compound XVIII having the desired OR⁴ groups in the 22 and 23 positions is then dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofuran and subjected to catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd C or Pt black under conventional hydrogenating conditions whereby the benzyl group in the 6β position is split off to obtain 3α,5 cyclo 22R,23R di OR⁴ 5α cholestan 6β ol II g . In the same manner as described above with respect to the conversion of the compound II a or II c to the compound I a, I c , the compound II g can also be oxidized optionally to the corresponding 6 one compound I g . The compound I g thus obtained is a valuable intermediate for the preparation of brassinone 28 norcastasterone . In addition to the new processes for preparing the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula A , a new process for the preparation of the known compound XIII has also been found by the present inventors. Although several processes have been reported heretofore as teaching the route for preparing the compound XIII from stigmasterol III , such processes require a number of steps and give a very poor yield of the products. However, the present inventors have found that the known compound X A which can easily be converted to the compound XIII according to the conventional process can be obtained in a smaller number of steps from the known compound VI A in a good yield. According to the new short circuit process, the known compound VI A is treated with 3 methyl 1 butynyl lithium whereby a new compound VII A wherein the ratio of 22R 22S is 3 2 is obtained. The 22R and 22S isomers can be separated by column chromatography on silica gel and the 22S isomer can be converted into the 22R isomer, for example, by the Mitsunobu reaction using triphenylphosphine, a diazocarboxylate and benzoic acid. The resultant 22R isomers of the compound VII A are combined and subjected to catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of P2 nickel catalyst followed by epoxidation with a peroxide to afford a new epoxy compound IXA . This new compound is then treated with trimethylaluminum and n butyl lithium under strong cooling whereby the known compound XA is obtained in an overall yield of 35 41 in a yield corrected for the recovery of the compound IXA . As the radical R in 6β position of these compounds in this new process is methyl group, this new process will be referred to hereinafter as the methyl ether process. On the other hand, the new compound XB used as the starting compound in the latter half of the process ii as shown in Scheme 3 can be prepared from stigmasterol according to the new process wherein the 6β hydroxy group of the compound IV is first etherified with benzyl alcohol to form 6β benzyloxy group as shown in Scheme 6. The new compound VB having the 6β benzyloxy group is then converted into the new compound XB via the new compounds VIB , VIIB , VIIIB and IXB , as described hereinbefore, in a similar manner to the methyl ether process. In this new process, an overall yield of the compound XB based on stigmasterol is 19.5 23.7 in a yield corrected for the recovery of the compound IXB . This new process serves not only to reduce the number of steps in the prior art processes required for preparing brassinolide and its analogues but also to improve various factors in the process, including the yield of products, reaction conditions and labor conditions, so that these merits make the new process attractive from the economical and industrial points of view. This new process will be referred to hereinafter as the benzyl ether process. The benzyl ether process constitutes the former half of the processes ii and iv of the present invention. The steroid compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula A, especially the specific formula I a, I c, I d, I e, I f and I g can advantageously be used in the subsequent steps for the preparation of brassinolide and its analogues. The routes for preparing brassinolide and its analogues from the compounds of the present invention are shown in Scheme 7 wherein Ac stands for acetyl group and R stands for the group indicated for the particular formulas and wherein the Part a relates to the new isomerization step from the compound I a to the known compound XV a according to this invention, the Parts b and c relate to the same isomerization step from the compounds I c and I g to the new compounds XV c and XV g , respectively and to the subsequent new steps for preparing brassinolide and the Part d relates to the steps continuing from the Part b for the preparation of brassinone. In Part a of Scheme 7, the compound I a obtained according to the process i is converted into the known compound XV a which is one of the valuable intermediates for the synthesis of brassinolide and is converted thereinto according to the prior art process as shown in Scheme 1. The isomerization process for converting the compound I a to the known compound XV a has been developed for the first time by the present inventors and is carried out smoothly to afford a better yield of the product. It has surprisingly been found that when the compound I a of this invention is treated in a polar solvent with a metal salt, this compound is efficiently isomerized to the compound XV a . Examples of the metal salt in this reaction include lithium bromide, sodium bromide and magnesium bromide, with the lithium bromide being preferable. Illustrative of the polar solvent are, for example, a dialkylformide such as dimethylformamide or diethylformamide and a dialkylacetamide such as dimethylacetamide. In detail, the compound I a is dissolved in such polar solvent and the metal salt and a catalytically small amount of p toluenesulfonic acid are added to the solution. The mixture is then heated to afford the compound XV a in a good yield. The compound XV a can be converted into brassinolide according to the prior art process, e.g. Ikekawa et al. or Siddall et al. process as described in some detail hereinbefore with respect to the route shown in Scheme 1. The Parts b and c show a new route for preparing brassinosteroid from the compound I c or I g . In Part b constituting the former half of this new route, the compound I c or I g is converted into the compound XV c or XV g , respectively, in the same isomerization reaction as described with respect to the compound I a . The compound XV c or XV g is then treated in an aqueous organic solvent such as a mixture of water and tetrahydrofuran and or tert butanol with osmium tetraoxide and N methylmorpholine oxide whereby the double bond in the 2,3 positions is opened to yield the corresponding 2,3 dihydroxyl compound XXIII c or XXIII g , respectively. This compound is then reacted with a dialkylketone dialkylacetal such as acetone dimethylacetal in the presence of a catalytically small amount of p toluenesulfonic acid whereby the two isomers XXIV c or XXIV g and XXV c or XXV g of the corresponding 2,3 alkylidenedioxy isopropylidenedioxy in Scheme 7 compound are obtained, which can be separated from each other by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate n hexane as eluent. The compounds shown in Part b are all new compounds. In Part c , the compound XXIV c is subjected to Bayer Villiger oxidation whereby an oxa group is introduced into the ring B to form the 7 oxa B homo structure and at the same time the alkylidene group in the 2,3 position is split off to give 2R,3S,22R,23R,24S 2,3 dihydroxy 22,23 diacetoxy 24 methyl B homo 7 oxa 5α cholestan 6 one XXVI . This product can be converted easily to brassinolide, i.e. 2R,3S,22R,23R,24S 2,3,22,23 tetrahydroxy 24 methyl B homo 7 oxa 5α cholestan 6 one XXVIII , by the treatment with a caustic alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide in an aqueous alcoholic solution. In Part c , all the compounds except brassinolide are new compounds. In Part d showing the route for preparing brassinone from the compound XXIV g which is in turn derived from the compound XV g , the compound XXIV g is first subjected to an alkaline solvolysis conducted in an aqueous alcoholic solution with a caustic alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide to split off the acyl group in the 22 and 23 positions and then to an acidic solvolysis conducted in an aqueous strong acid such as an aqueous solution of a mineral acid, e.g. HCl to split off the alkylidene group in 2,3 position whereby brassinone or 28 norcastasterone XXVIII is obtained. According to the present invention, various remarkable improvements can be made in the prior art processes for preparing brassinosteroids. Firstly, the present invention provides a new process for preparing the compound XV a from the compound XIII which can be carried out economically on an industrial scale and involves a specific new isomerization step from the compound I a to the compound XV a . Secondly, the present invention provides plural new processes for preparing brassinosteroids from stigmasterol in a smaller number of steps or in a better yield. In this connection, the present invention provides the new methyl ether process using the 6β methoxy compounds for preparing the compound XA from stigmasterol through the compounds VA IXA as well as the new benzyl ether process using the 6β benzyloxy compounds for preparing the compound II a, II b or II c from stigmasterol through the new compounds VB XVIB a or XVIB c . In case of the methyl ether process, the yield of the compound XA is as high as 35 based on the compound VIA through 4 steps. In case of the benzyl ether process, the compound XV a can be prepared in a total yield of 14.5 from stigmasterol. In case the compound II c is used in place of the compound II a , the new compound XV c can be obtained according to the benzyl ether process from stigmasterol in a total yield of 15 , requiring only 11 steps. According to the present invention, the yield of brassinolide based on stigmasterol is 7.8 through 15 steps. This yield is quite surprising since the maximum yield reported hitherto is about 3 based on stigmasterol in Mori et al. process involving 16 steps. Thus, the process of this invention as a whole is advantageous as compared with the prior art processes and is easily operable on an industrial scale without any difficulty.
