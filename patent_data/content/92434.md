# Photo optical snap on paper path sensor.

## Abstract
A snap on unitary, one piece photo optical item position sensor fabricated as a clothes pin like plastic member from a material which is substantially transparent to infra red radia tion obvieting lenses. The sensor member is bifurcated at one end to form two parallel leg portions 18, 20 the outboard end of each one of which carries one element of the photo optical sensing apparatus. The opposite end of the sensor member is rectangularly shaped and slotted on opposite parallel sides forming a polarized receptacle 34 for a mating polarized plug 44 as well as a handle for griping. Compression of the handle portion 46, 48 contacts the slotted end slightly while opening or spreading the two parallel leg portions 18, 20 enabling the sensor to be snapped over an orthogonally disposed item guide or track. Oppositely disposed parallel members 64 on the lower portion of the track automatically position the sensor over the track. A notch in the lower track permits the optical sensing apparatus to be axially aligned perpendicular to the item guide track.
