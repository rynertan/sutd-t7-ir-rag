# Hydrocarbon anti foam granules.

## Abstract
Anti foam granules for use in detergent compositions to prevent over foaming in automatic washing machines contain hydrophobic silica and a mixture of liquid and solid hydro carbons. This active material is sorbed on a core material which produces a mechanical action on addition to water, for example sodium perborate monohydrate or gelatinised starch.

## Description
HYDROCARBON ANTI FOAM GRANULES This invention relates to anti foam granules for use in detergent compositions and to a process,for their preparation. The low foaming fabric washing powder market in Europe is now well developed and a number of different anti foam compounds have been used to suppress the inherent tendency of powders containing anionic and nonionic surfactants to over foam when used in front loading, drum type washing machines. For instance, mixtures of certain alkyl phosphoric acids with hydrocarbon waxes, certain silicone oil hydrophobic silica mixtures and liquid hydrocarbons have all been used as an alternative to soap as anti foam, and a number of other proposals have been made and are published in the patent literature. Amongst the latter publications is French patent No 2 416 946, which relates to compositions containing a special mixture of liquid hydrocarbon with either a solid hydrocarbon or a fatty acid ester and a hydrophobic silica.Specifically the anti foam system consists of A 1 30 98 of a liquid hydrocarbon 2 2 70 of an auxiliary substance selected from solid hydrocarbons M Pt 35 1000C and long chain fatty acid esters of fatty alcohols, or mixtures thereof and B 0.1 25 of hydrophobic silica. We too have been studying the use of mixtures of hydrophobic silica with hydrocarbons of various descriptions and have discovered that if these materials are incorporated into a granule based on a substrate which produces a mechanical action on addition to water, then it is not necessary to use the proportions specified in French patent No 2 416 946, but it is possible to use mixtures containing much less of the liquid component. There are 2 number of types of substrate which will produce a mechanical action on the granule. For example gelatinisec starch is a substrate which swells rapidly on addition to water thereby breaking up the structure of the granule and leading to extremely good dispersion of the hydrocarbon.Similarly sodium perborate monohydrate is both extremely water soluble and also evolves gas when immersed, both properties being ones which tend to break up the granule. Accordingly the present invention provides a detergent composition containing an anionic detergent active compound and or a non ionic surfactant and anti foam granules comprising hydrophobic silica and a mixture of liquid and solid hydrocarbons, characterised in that the liquid hydrocarbon component constitutes less than 30 by weight of the total hydrocarbon and in that the silica and the mixture of liquid and solid hydrocarbons are sorbed on a core of a material producing a mechanical action on addition to water. A second aspect of the invention provides two alternative processes for manufacturing granules for use in the compositions. According to this aspect the invention provides first a process for the production of anti foam granules which comprises a forming a molten mixture of the liquid and solid hydrocarbons together with the hydrophobic silica b spraying the molten mixture onto agitated particles of the core material.Secondly, it provides a process for the production of anti foam granules which comprises a forming a molten mixture of the liquid and solid hydrocarbons together with the hydrophobic silica b admixing the molten mixture with particles of the core material and c grinding the resultant mass to granules. Normally speaking, the compositions of the invention will contain both a nonionic surfactant and an anionic detergent active compound. In general compositions which contain both types of detergent produce lower amounts of foam than those which contain only anionic surfactant and consequently lower amounts of anti foam granule will be required to control the foam. Typical anionic detergent active compounds, which may be present in amounts of from about 2 to 35 by weight of the finished compositions are sodium alkylbenzene sulphonates, preferably the C10 C16 alkyl compounds, sodium primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, preferably the C10 C22 alkyl sulphates, sodium olefine sulphonates, preferably the C10 Cl8 sulphonates and sddium alkane suiphonates. Soaps of fatty acids may also be present, preferably the sodium and potassium salts ofC10 C22 fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated.Where soap is the sole anionic surfactant it may be present in an amount up to about 65 by weight of the finished composition, down to about 0.2 by weight when other anionic surfactants are present. Typical soaps which can be used are those formed from coconut oil, tallow, hydrogenated tallow, hydrogenated rapeseed oil and natural oils containing high proportions of oleic acid such as sunflower oil. Typical nonionic surfactants, are ethoxylated primary and secondary alcohols of from 8 to 25 carbon atoms containing from 3 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. These materials may generally be present in an amount of from 1 to 25 by weight, based on the weight of the finished composition. Typical detergency builders which can be used are the water soluble phosphates, carbonates, percarbonates and aluminosilicates, particularly.the sodium and potassium salts of these compounds. Organic builders may also be used, examples being sodium carboxymethyloxysuccinate, sodium citrate, sodium polyacrylates and sodium nitrilotriacetate. Any of these compounds, or any other builder compound, in any suitable mixture, may be used in amounts of from 5 to 60 by weight of the finished composition.Other components which will normally be present are bleaching agents, corrosion inhibitors, anti redeposition agents, fluorescers, stabilisers and substantial proportions of water. The invention will be further illustrated by means of the following example Example Six detergent powders having the following formulations were prepared by conventional slurry making, spray drying and dry dosing techniques. by weight I II III IV V VISodium alkylbenzene sulphonate 7 7 9 9 8.25 9.00C13 15 Ethoxylated alcohol llEO 4.0 2.5 0.80 0.80 C 12 18 Ethoxylated alcohol 8EO 4.0 C 13 15 Ethoxylated alcohol 7EO 2 4 3.0 3.20Hardened rapeseed oil soap 0.5 0.50Sodium tripolyphosphate 34 34 34 34 34 34Sodium perborate 24 24 24 23 24 24Anti foam granules 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 1Minor components sodium, silicate, enzyme, fluorescer Balance to 100.00 The general experimental technique for assessment of. the efficacy of various anti foam granules in suppressing the foam produced by these powders is as follows First each powder was subjected to accelerated ageing by storing it in an E3 unlaminated cardboard carton for 2 or 4 weeks at 370C and 60 relative humidity. 200 gms of the powder was placed in the powder dispenser of a Brandt 433 washing machine containing 4 Kg of clean clothes. The clothes were then washed, using the main wash cycle which heats up to 900C, and using water of 300 French hardness. Foam height was measured against an arbitrary scale attached to the window of the washing machine. The anti foam granules for incorporation into powders were prepared by forming a molten mixture of the liquid hydrocarbon, the solid hydrocarbon and silica and spraying the mixture onto the sorbent in a pan granulator.

On the other hand, some deactivation after storage accelerated test is noticed, nevertheless, the foam control of the granules remains quite satisfactory.
