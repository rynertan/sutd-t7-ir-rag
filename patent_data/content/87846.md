## Description
A device for taking up and putting down containers This invention relates to a device for bringing an exchangeable container from a lower level onto a vehicle or other carrying device and the reverse, with a carriage movable over the vehicle and carrying a lifting device with jack means for one end of the container, said lifting device having a part movable downwardly to engage an engaging part of a container in a lower position and being movable upwardly to lift the lower edge of the adjacent end of the container to the supporting level for the container on the vehicle or the like. Such devices are known in different embodiments. More especially such a device is known from the Netherlands patent applicaìon 69.18372, in which the vehicle has a bdy engageable around an end part of the container, in which the carriage, after lifting the container until its front edge is at some distance above the supporting level on the vehicle or the like, is displaced along the vehicle until the container enters into engagement with rollers on the vehicle or the like in a zone more close to the center of its length, after which the lifting device is lowered in order to tilt the container until its lower surface is entirely on the supporting level for the container. To engage the container, the lifting device is provided with parts slidable sideways towards and away from the container. The present invention aims at improving such structures and to obtain a simple and reliable device suitable for lifting widely differing types and sizes of containers onto a vehicle also if this has a high supporting surface for the containers, without danger of accidents by loosening of the container from the lifting means, in which moreover the container only has to be lifted with its lower edge to the supporting surface on the vehicle and not higher and in which the engaging part of the lifting device is not subjected to and does not have to transmit high horizontal forces. In view thereof a device as indicated in the preamble is according to the invention characterized in that the said lifting device has a hook opening upwardly, which when moving upwardly from a lowet,aost position is adapted to be in carrying engagement with the engaging part of the container, and that the said carriage has a hook opening downwardly or similar locking part, positioned so that it engages from above a protruding part of the container in a position in which said lower edge thereof has been lifted to the supporting level on the vehicle or the like. In this way it is not necessary to guide the hook opening upwardly in such a way that it is suited to take up high horizontal forces, as the hook opening downwardly or other locking part on the carriage exerts the horizontal forces necessary to bring the container entirely onto the vehicle or the like. Moreover the hook opening downwardly locks the container at the concerning end against upward movements, which avoids accidents, in particular in the part of the path of the container in which its center of gravity is still outside the supporting surface on the vehicle or the like. It is thus possible to suspend the hook opening upwardly easily for instance from a cable or chain, which makes it easy to connect it to the container also if the container and the vehicle are not exactly in one mutual position.But even if the hook opening upwardly is rigidly connected to a part of a jack cylinder, the fact that the downwardly open hook takes over functions as to the transmitting of forces offers the other advantages mentioned, also with respect to a relatively light embodiment in horizontal direction of the movable parts of the device. Moreover, the suspending of the upwardly opening hook to a flexible pulling member has the advantage that said pulling member may be used in such a way as to give a long distance of lifting for the container with a shorter stroke of the jack means. On the other hand, the arrangement of the upwardly open hook onto the movable part of a jack cylinder has the advantage that it is easy to engage different types of containers, also if these have their engaging parts for such a hook at mutually different heights. Moreover the situation is more stable when lifting the container if this is applied, and in some respects it is also more safe as to possibility of movements of the container during lifting. The invention will now be explained by way of example with reference to the attached drawings. Therein Fig. 1 is a somewhat diagrammatic sideview of a device according to the invention in a first embodiment Fig. 2 is a sideview of the same device in an other position Fig. 3 is a perspective view of part of a container with engaging parts according to the invention Fig. 4 is a sideview of a carriage for such a device, but in an other embodiment andFig. 5 is a section and view along the line V V in Fig. 4. The vehicle 1 of Figs. 1 and 2 has a vehicle frame 2 and thereon a loading frame 3 connected thereto through a horizontal pivot axis at the back end of the vehicle at 4 and movable about said pivots by a jack cylinder 5. On said loading frame 3 a carriage 6 is provided, to which both ends of a cable or chain 7 are connected, which cable or chain is guided over rollers 8 and 9 on the loading frame. The carriage is guided by running rollers or slide pieces in beams of the loading frame 3 acting as guide trades for this carriage. The running rollers or slide pieces have not been shown here, but such rollers are indicated by 25 in Fig. 4 and 5. By drive means not shown for cable or chain 7, e.g.driving roller 8 or roller 9, the carriage is movable over the loading frame from front to back thereof and the reverse. The carriage 6 has an upstanding hydraulic double acting jack cylinder 10 with piston or plunger rod or sleeve slidable into and out of said cylinder and may have a sheath or tube, e.g. of square or rectangular cross section, surrounding such rod, such movable part or parts being indicated by 11 and carrying to rollers 12 at their top. A cable or chain 13 is guided over each of said rollers, is connected rigidly to the casing of the jack cylinder 10 at 14 and is provided at its other end with a hook 15 opening upwardly Fig. 3 . Moreover the carriage has two rigid downwardly open hooks 16, horizontally at a distance one to the side of the other and rigidly connected near the lower end of the casing of the jack cylinder 10. A roller 17 guides the cables or chains 13 between itself and the casing of said cylinder. A container 18 is shown in part in Fig. 1 as standing on the earth behind the vehicle and in Fig. 2 in a position partly lifted onto the vehicle. This container is provided at the side where it is engaged by parts of the vehicle with a horizontal shaft 19 welded to brackets 20 near the outer ends and 21 at a distance to the inside thereof to the container. The jack cylinder 10 is in a position somewhat inclined with respect to the loading frame 3, e.g. at an angle of about 800 thereto or somewhat less. In the embodiment of Figs. 4 and 5 a double acting jack cylinder 10 is shown having its moving part 11 protruding downwardly and rigidly connected to the remainder of the carriage 6 also in a somewhat inclined position. The upwardly open hook 15 is provided near the lower end of casing or sheath 22 moving up and down with the movable part 11 and being guided during such movements between the cylinder 10 and a fixed casing or sheath 23.In the lower most position of parts 11 and 22 the hook is in a lower position than the shaft 19 on a container Fig. 4 , so that, by shortening the jack cylinder, it is able to tilt the container at the adjacent end until said shaft reaches the two downwardly open hooks 16, positioned at a horizontal distance one to the side of the other, so that in said position this shaft 19 is adequately enclosed all around before the carriage pulls the container onto the vehicle. Some containers have an engaging part such as a lug, ear or eye at a much higher position than the engaging parts shown in Fig. 3. For lifting such containers there may be a second upwardly open hook 15 connected to the movable sheath 22. To allow movement thereof to the corresponding high position on the carriage a longitudinal slot 26 is made in the rigid casing or sheath 23, so that the hook 15 is adapted to cooperate with two open hooks 16 opening down wardly provided near the top of said casing or sheath one to the side of the other. Such hooks 16 may be provided on a clip or strap 24 engaging slidably around a fixed sheath or casing 23 so as to be moved up and down along it and having means not shown to be rigidly connected thereto at the desired height depending on the height of the concerning engaging part on the container to be lifted.If desired the hook 15 may also be slidably displaceable on the sheath 22 and securable the only desired height depending on the embodiment of the concerning container. The hooks 16 are horizontally so far apart that they allow in this case the hook. 15 to pass between them upwardly and downwardly. The somewhat inclined position of the jack cylinder with respect to the loading frame 3 has the advantage that, when taking up and putting down containers there is no harm in an unlevel position of the vehicle with respect to the container e.g. by uneven earth surface, e.g. if the front of the vehicle or the back of the container are in a higher position than the other end thereof and there is neither danger of the upper edge of the container, which often protrudes therefrom, to hit parts of the vehicle, the carriage and the jack structure, and this also makes it easy to begin raising the loading frame 3 into an inclined position as in Fig. 2 before the lifting of the front edge of the container is completed. It is preferred in this structure to put the loading bridge 3 first of all into such an inclined position when taking up a container that the jack cylinder 10, having a rigid angular position with respect to the loading frame 3, is in a substantially vertical position. In this position the horizontal forces are at their lowest level. Then, as soon as the container is in a position in which its lower edge is at the height of the back edge of the loading frame 3, this frame is inclined further until it reaches about the same angular position as the container. It is then possible to pull the container onto the loading frame while it moves only linearly, also after it is no more in contact with the earth, by moving the carriage forwardly and upwardly along the loading frame, the enclosing of the shaft 19 on the container between the hooks 15 and 16 making this easily and safely possible. During this movement of pulling the container onto the loading frame, this loading frame may be lowered by jack cylinder 5. With the structure of Figs. 1 to 3 having chains or cables 13 it is possible for an operating person to displace the hook 15 in its lower position somewhat by hand of foot to hook it onto the shaft 19 on the container and in the embodiment of Figs. 4 and 5 the vehicle should be positioned somewhat more accurately with respect to the container.
