The apparatus is designed to support two rotary slide tray 26, 44 disposed one above the other. Means 38, 40 is provided for indexing the lower tray 26 and a coupling member 46 extends between the two trays so that the upper tray 44 is indexed in synchronism with the lower tray 26 . A chute 52 is provided for conveying slides from the upper tray 44 to the lower tray 26 and is shaped to turn the slides laterally so that they enter the second tray 26 in reverse orientation compared with their former orientation in the first tray 44 . In one embodiment, a carousel type slide projector provides the means for indexing the trays. In another embodiment, a slide rever sing apparatus having built in indexing means is disclosed.
