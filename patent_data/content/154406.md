# Electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
An electrolytic cell comprising an anode and cathode and a gasket of an electrically insulating composition in which the gasket is made of an electrically insulating composition which comprises a homogeneous mixture of an elastomeric polymer and at least 15 , and optionally up to 70 , of polytetrafluoroethylene by weight of the composi tion. Also a gasket suitable for use in an electrolytic cell, and a process of electrolysis which is operated in the electrolytic cell. Aqueous alkali metal chloride solution may be electroly sed in the electrolytic cell.
