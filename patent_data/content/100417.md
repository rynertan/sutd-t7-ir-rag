# Control device particularly useful as manual slide valve.

## Abstract
A manual slide valve comprises a housing having a valve slide slidable within the housing. The housing is constituted of two sections each including projections and recesses cooperable with each other and with the slide valve such that when the slide valve is disposed within the housing, the housing sections are interlocked with it and with each other against separation, and when the slide valve is removed from the housing, the housing sections are free and may be separated from each other. The control device may also be embodied in an electrical switch wherein the slide member is the movable electrical contact.
