# Digital data recording and reproducing method.

## Abstract
In a digital data recording and reproducing method, a digital data sequence is divided into every 8 bit digital data, when the divided 8 bit digital data is encoded to 14 bit code, an 8 bit digital data wherein value of DSV is limited in a predetermined range is selected from two codes correspond ing to 8 bit digital data, and in an encoding process, the number of bit 0 which is inserted between two bits 1 in the code sequence is restricted to a number of from one to eight, and hence, DC component in the code sequence is eliminated.
