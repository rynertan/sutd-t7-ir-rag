# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF META ARYLOXYBENZALDEHYDES, AND META ARYLOXYBENZALDEHYDES PRODUCED BY THE PROCESS

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of meta aryloxybenzaldehydes, especially meta phenoxybenzaldehyde, which comprises reacting a mixture of meta aryloxybenzyl and meta aryloxybenzal halides with hexamethylenetetramine and hydrolysing the resulting product in the presence of a non acidic solvent. Meta phenoxy benzaldehyde is an important intermediate in the manufacture of a group of insecticidally active compounds known as pyrethroids.
