# Surface treatment method of heat resistant alloy.

## Abstract
A method of surface treatment of a member made of heat resistant alloy comprises spraying onto the surface of said member as a first layer a coating of a heat resistant material comprising for example a metal such as Ni or Cr or a Ni Cr alloy or a compound thereof. A liquid coating contain ing a corrosion resistant material is then applied as a second layer on to the first layer. The member is then heat treated to effect penetration by diffusion of one coating into the other.

## Description
Surface Treatment Method of Heat Resistant Alloy This invention relates to a method of surface treatment of a member of heat resistant alloy for use in turbines, blowers, boilers or the like to render itresistant to high temperature oxidation as well as to high temperature corrosion. In industrial gas turbines using petroleum or natural gas as the fuel, gas temperature at the turbine inlet tends to become higher as the turbine efficiency is improved. On the other hand, as the available fuel supply has changed for the worse in recent years, the fuels used for the turbines have been diversified and the content of corrosive impurities in the fuels such as sulphur S , sodium Na , vanadium V , and so forth has tended to increase. As a result, so called hot parts such as the blades and burners of turbines, that are exposed to these high temperature gases, are subjected to extremely severe high temperature oxidation as well as high temperature corrosion. These hot parts have conventionally been made primarily of heat resistant alloys. In particular turbine blades consist of Ni and Co based alloys called ultra alloys . However, since high temperature strength is generally a top priority requirement for these ultra alloys, they have the drawback that their corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance are not satisfactory. Various attempts have therefore been made to provide these heat resistant alloys with oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance and various surface treatment methods using for example chemical and physical techniques have been employed. However, none of these methods has been really satisfactory as regards efficiency and cost. The present invention is directed to providing a method which overcomes the deficiences of the previous methods. Accordingly, in order to provide a member of heat resistant alloy with high temperature oxidation resistance and high temperature corrosion resistance, the present invention provides a surface treatment method which is characterized by the steps of coating by spraying onto the surface of said member in the form of a substrate, a heat resistant material of metals such asNi and Cr or Ni Cr alloys or their compounds as a first layer, then applying, as a second layer, a liquid coating containing metals such as A , Si, Vr, Ts and the like or their alloys or compounds as the corrosion resistant material by means of spray coating, brush coating or the like, and heat treating the coated surface. The surface treatment method of the present invention provides the characterizing features as illustrated inTable 1 in comparison with the conventional methods.

A substrate of Udimet 520 by weight 19 Cr, 12 Co, 6 Mo, 3 Ti, 28 A , 1 Fe, Ni Bal , widely used as an ultra alloy for the hot parts of a gas turbine, was treated in the following sequence 1 After the surface of the substrate had been cleaned with an alkaline emulsion cleaning agent, steam cleaning was carried out using a Fluron type solvent. The surface was further blasted using an At 203 blast. 2 A Ni Cr 50 50 by weight alloy was applied as a coating to form a first layer having a thickness of about 50 r by plasma spraying. 3 The surface of the sprayed on first layer was blasted using At 203 to remove any oxide film formed on its outermost surface. 4 The surface of the sprayed on first layer was coated by spraying on a coating slurry formed by dispersing A and SiO2, each having a particle size of about 0.1 to Le, in an organic carrier alcohol, solvent naphtha, etc to form a second layer. 5 After these treatments, the substrate was placed in an electric furnace and was held at 80 C. 5 C for 20 minutes to evaporate and remove the liquid. After being further held at 330 0C i 5 C for 15 minutes, the substrate was withdrawn from the furnace. 6 The substrate was held at 1,0800C for 4 hours inside a hydrogen furnace, was cooled in the furnace and was then withdrawn. Above mentioned step 4 could be carried out using a mixture offine AQ particles with At 2 3 powder in a mixing ratio by weight of 80 20 or 50 50 or a mixture of At with SiC2 in a mixing ratio by weight of 80 20 or 50 50. Also step 6 could be carried out using a vacuum furnace in place of the hydrogen furnace. Although in this example Udimet 520 has been treated by the method of the invention by way of example, similar excellent results can also be obtained when treating the surfaces of other substrates such Ni based alloy, Co based alloy and stainless steel. The coated surface of the substrate provided by the above described method had an extremely smooth and flat surface and A and Si from the second layer sufficiently penetrated by diffusion into the first layer, thereby completely eliminating the fine pores of the first layer.Hence, the composite coating was, rendered wholly homogeneous. In other words, since the melting point of lL num is 66O0C., AL was fused due to the heat treatment and penetrated into the fine pores, thus presumably rendering the surface smooth and flat. Further, it was confirmed that a part of AL and Si reached and was diffused also into the substrate. Table 2 illustrates the results of fly ash errosion resistance test, corrosion resistance test, and practical application test using gas turbine blades, each test being applied to a member treated by a method in accordance with the present invention and a member treated by a conventional method. The composite coating produced by the method in accordance with the present invention had a better performance in comparison with that produced by the conventional method in the fly ash errosion resistance test and the corrosion resistance test. In the practical application test using gas turbine blades, too, the coated blade produced using the method of the present invention exhibited the tendency that the deposition amount of the fuel ash became smaller.In a thermal inpact test comprising holding the testpiece at 1,1000C. for 15 minutes, then charging it into the water at 20 C. and repeating these procedures five times, the composite coating produced by the method of the present invention did not suffer peeling or cracking and had extremely good adhesion.
