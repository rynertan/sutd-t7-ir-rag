# Apparatus for determining the result of answers to a set of related questions.

## Abstract
A method for determining the result of answers to a set of related questions each having at least two answers includes the step of operating respective answer devices for all the questions. Operation of the answer devices results in presentation of answer symbols forming part of an array. The array can be an array of answer symbols in which all possible combinations of answers to the set of questions are represented, as in a complete decision table. After operation of all the answer devices, the presented answer symbols define not more than one complete path through the array. The path corresponds to a unique combination of answers and leads the operator to one reference out of a set of references carried by a record member. The invention also provides apparatus for performing the method.
