# MULTI FUNCTION DENTAL OPERATING LIGHT SOURCE

## Abstract
A multi function dental operating light source comprises a series of optical filters and flat reflectors mounted upon a turntable at spaced locations around the periphery, the turntable being rotatable about a fixed axis relative to a stationary tungsten halogen lamp having a parabolic reflec tor and including stationary spherical mirrors mounted to reflect light forward. The optical filters are adapted respec tively to produce pure white light beams free of any color hue for oral illumination purposes, shade matching light beams, no cure light beams to prevent polymerization of light curable resins when exposed to said light for observa tion purposes, a photocuring light beam extending through a light condensing cone and suitable to effect polymerization of light curable resins, and means to adjust the voltage supply to the lamp filament to produce by the respective optical filters, mirrors, and light condensing cone the desired type of illumination and photocuring functions the optical filters respectively are capable of producing.
