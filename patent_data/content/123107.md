# Toner image fixing device.

## Abstract
A toner image fixing device comprising a driven fixing roller 4 drivingly connected to a driving source M and a rotatably mounted follower fixing roller 6 . The follower fix ing roller 6 is mounted on a movable supporting member 42 which is mounted for free movement between a contact ing position at which the follower fixing roller 6 is kept in press contact with the driven fixing roller 4 and a non contacting position at which the follower fixing roller 6 is kept out of press contact with the driven fixing roller 4 . The device also includes a press contacting control mechanism for selectively holding the movable supporting member 42 at the contacting position and the non contacting position. The press contacting control mechanism includes a position ing member 46 connected to the movable supporting member 42 via a spring means 78 and an actuating means 84 for selectively holding the positioning member at an operating position and a non operating position. When the positioning member 46 is moved to the operating position, the movable supporting member 42 is moved to the contact ing position via the spring means 78 . When the positioning member 46 is moved to the non operating position, the movable supporting member 42 is moved to the non operating position via the spring means 78 .
