# Radiation tolerant semiconductor device and method of making such a device.

## Abstract
A radiation tolerant semiconductor device has a buried grid 11 of enhanced concentration of an impurity type opposite to that of the semiconductor substrate. Such a device may be made by providing beneath the upper surface of a semiconductor substrate a continuous region 12, 13 of a first impurity type which is the same as that of the semiconductor substrate, the region having an array of regularly spaced via portions 13 at a depth beneath the surface greater than the depth of the remainder of the region 12 , and providing at a depth substantially coincident with the via portions 13 a second impurity of conductivity type opposite to that of the first impurity at a dosage level lower than that of the first impurity to form the buried grid 11 .
