# Wind power generating system.

## Abstract
A wind power generating system of the type comprising a tower 250 having a base 462 and a propeller 16 mounted on the tower for rotation in response to the wind, and comprising means 176 to position the propeller to face the wind regardless of wind direction, positive displacement pump means 14 directly coupled to the propeller for being driven thereby, positive and variable displacement motor means 18 at the base of the tower, hydraulic circuit means 12 coupling the motor means with the pump means for driving the former by output of the latter, synchronous electric generator means drive 22 coupled to the positive displacement motor, and means 20 for varying the displacement of the positive displacement motor means to increase the displacement thereof with increased fluid pressure in the hydraulic circuit means and to decrease the displacement in response to a decrease in the fluid pressure in the hydraulic circuit in accordance with a predetermined relationship of propeller speed and power.
