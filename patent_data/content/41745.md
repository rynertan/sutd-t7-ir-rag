## Description
UREA FOI iiAt DEHYDE RESIN BASED ADHESIVE CONTAINING CALCIUMAND OR L4ONIUM LIGNINSULPEONATE AS ADDITIVE, A UREA FOM4ALDE HYDE RESIN MODIFIED WITH CALCIUM AND OR AMPIONIUM LIGNINSUL PHONATE, AlW METHODS FOR THE PRODUCTION TREREOF, FORPREPARING AGGLOMERATED WOOD PA1iELS The use of adhesives based on resins of the urea formaldehyde type is known in the industrial manufacture of so called chipboard panels, plywood and precomposed panels of plywood and agglomerated wood in general.Said adhesives provide for the mutual cohesion of the various parts of the wood, but have a certain drawback with regard to the mechanical and physical characteristics of the product, such as shape stability with time, preservation of the tensile and bending strength, and lack of resilience.A further and much greater drawback, which is reflected by serious application limitations, is the free formaldehyde contained in the panel, which reaches a value of about 50 mg per 100 grams of dry panel, this being extremely dangerous in terms of environmental pollution, especially in closed spaces.It has been surprisingly found that the addition of calcium and or ammonium ligninsulphonate, as contained in the wash liquid for the timber used for example in cellulose production, improves the aforesaid parameters when added to the normal resin composition. If the adhesive is produced in the usual manner by mixing resin, water and hardener, and then adding ligninsulphonate before use, results are obtained which are already satisfactory.However, the best results are obtained by adding the ligninsulphonate during the preparation of the resin, and then using this latter diluted and acidified in the normal manner.It should be noted at this point that the ligninsulphonate to be used according to the invention is a composite material, of which it is not possible to precisely determine the chemical composition, and which is usually obtainable in very large quantities as the waste product of processes for the preparation of cellulose or for the total or partial decoloration of wood in general.Said liquid has a dry residue of between 50 and 150 grams per litre, and is usually available in a concentration of 50 to 60 in water, referred to the dry product, and with a sulphur content, referred to the dry product, of between 6 and .8 by weight.As stated heretofore, one of the methods for using ligninsulphonate as a component of urea formaldehyde resin based adhesives comprises the addition thereof to the adhesive in the following weight proportions, at the end of the adhesive preparation cycle.The following materials are fed into a mixer 69 to 73 of normal urea formaldehyde resin 9 to 12 of water 2 to 5 of a normal hardener in a 2, solution for example ammonium chloride NH4C1 12 to 14 of ligninsulphonate as usually available, i.e. in a concentration of about 55 of dry product diluted in water.After mixing, a final product obviously a mixture is obtained, with which the pieces of wood to constitute the agglomerated wood product are coated in a normal plant.One embodiment of the method is illustrated in the following example. EXALE 1The following were fed into a mixer of 200 litres capacity, in the order stated 100 kg of urea formaldehyde resin as normally obtainable commercially, for example the SADECOL type produced by the applicant 15 kg of water 5 kg of a 2Q aqueous solution of ammonium chloride NH4 Cl 20 kg of ligninsulphonate as heretofore defined, having a concentration of 55 diluted in water.The resultant mixture was used to coat wet wooden chips in the normal manner.The mass thus obtained was fed to a well known BISONIT moulding machine of the wind type.In this manner, the mattress or mat is obtained, and is subsequently pressed in order to produce the chipboard panel.With respect to chipboard panels produced by conventional methods, the panels obtained in this manner are substantially more resilient, have greater stability with time, and a smaller free formaldehyde content which is less than 30 mg per 100 g of dry panel.In contrast, the tensile and bending strength are slightly less than in the case of panels produced without ligninsulphonate addition.The method for preparing urea formaldehyde resin based adhesive modified with ligninsulphonate during the production of the resin is as follows.Formaldehyde, urea and soda in the proportions given hereinafter are fed as raw materials to a reaction vessel, i.e.a normal reactor or autoclave consisting of a sealed vessel heated internally or externally and fitted with an internal mixer urea 1 mole formaldehyde 1.8 2.2 moles soda a sufficient quantity to obtain a pH of between 7 and 9.After feeding the raw materials and having checked that the pli lies within the desired range, mixing is commenced with simultaneous heating of the reactor until a temperature of 40 to 450C is attained. then said temperature is reached, heating is stopped and, while continuing mixing, ligninsulphonate is added in liquid form, constituted as stated by the simple timber wash liquid resulting from industrial producers of cellulose and the like, having a concentration of about 55w of dry product in water.The quantity of ligninsulphonate to be added is between 2 and 30 by weight of the previously obtained reaction product, according to the type of application for which the adhesive is intended.For example, the following ligninsulphonate percentages are suggested chipboard panels 6 to 14 plywood 13 to 30 .In the case of precomposed products, additions of between 2 and 8 are recommended.Having made said addition, the new mixture is again heated until a temperature of about 90 C is attained.On reaching this temperature, heating is again stopped and, after measuring the pli, the reaction product is acidified until its pH lies between 5 and 5.7, for example by adding acetic acid CH3COOB . 3Heating is again carried out until a temperature of about 95 0C is reached, and this temperature is maintained while continuing mixing, until the product attains the required water dilutability and viscosity to enable it to be marketed for the scheduled applications. On attaining these values viscosity at 200C of between 300 and 1000 c.p.s. and water dilutability of at least one part of resin in two parts of water , soda is added until a pB of greater than 7.5 is obtained. The product is cooled to 57 C, and urea is added in order to buffer the free formaldehyde until the final urea formaldehyde molar ratio lies between 1 1.2 and 1 1.6. It is then cooled to 25 300C and discharged from the reactor. The dry product residue, found by heating 1 gram of product to 1200C for 2 hours, exceeds 6g . The free formaldehyde, measured by analysis at 0 C, is less than 0.2 .One embodiment of the method is illustrated in the following example.EXAMPLE 2 366 57 g of formaldehyde having a concentration of 40 by weight are fed into a 1 litre glass flask complete with stirrer and placed in a heating bath, and the acidity is neutralised with 20 sodium hydroxide until the pli lies between 8.5 and 8.8.145.17 g of 100 urea are added, and the mixture heated to 400C. 18.23 g of water and 22.27 g of dry ligninsulphonate are added, and the pli is maintained at between 7 and 7.5, if necessary by adding sodium hydroxide. The mixture is heated to 90 C, and acetic acid concentrated to zoo is added in sufficient quantity to obtain a pH of 5.2 5.4.The temperature is allowed to rise to 95 C, and mixing is carried out until a viscosity of 40 c.p.s. is obtained.At this point, the pli is adjusted to 7.7 8 with sodium hydroxide, the mixture is cooled to 550C, and 125 g of water are distilled off. After distillation, 64.3 g of 100 urea are added, it is allowed to dissolve, and the mixture cooled to 20 C. The resin obtained has the following specification and characteristics percentage formulation by weight formaldehyde of 100 concentration 29.84 urea of 1002 concentration 42.62 ligninsulphonate 1 of ioo concentration 4.53 water 23.01 1 in the final analysis, the presence of the ligninsulphon ate is deduced from the weight of sulphur contained, which is 6 8 of the dry ligninsulphonate. dry residue from 1 gram of product heated for 2 hours at 1200C 65 viscosity 400 650 c.p.s. pH at 20 C 7.8 8.5 free formaldehyde at 0 C 0.2 The production cost of the adhesive by the method heretofore described shows a saving of between 5 and 1070 over conventional adhesives, and in addition the agglomerated wood products which are manufactured using the present adhesive have better mechanical, time stability and resilience characteristics, and also better tensile and bending strengths than conventional products. A further and not indifferent advantage of the invention is that it provides for the use of considerable quantities of ligninsulphonate, which at the present time is seen as a highly polluting effluent product.The invention is not limited to the single embodiments heretofore described, and modifications and improvements can be made thereto without leaving the scope of the inventive idea, the basic characteristics of which are summarised in the following claims.
