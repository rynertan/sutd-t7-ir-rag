# HIGH RELIABILITY DOUBLE CHAMBERED SHIELDING SYSTEM FOR WELDING

## Abstract
An apparatus 50 for shielding a circumferentiai region about elongate workpieces from air contamination during welding or heat treatment includes a pair of generally cylin drical shields 52, 54 which define central openings for receiving the workpieces, and which are positioned in long tudinally spaced apart relationship about the region to be welded or heat treated. Each shield 54 includes a first annular chamber 70 and associated annular diffuser posi tioned adjacent the process zone, and a second annular chamber 86 and associated cylindrical diffuser 90 ex tending away from the zone which chambers 70, 86 are connected to independent sources of inert gas, which is directed into and out of the process zone to prevent air contamination of the process zone.
