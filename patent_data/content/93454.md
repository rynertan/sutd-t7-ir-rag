# A process for the separation of mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons into single components.

## Abstract
Process for the separation of aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. xylenes from their mixture, in which the mixture is passed in the vapour phase at 152, 5 250 C over a potassium exchanged zeolite Y which has been saturated with iso propylbenzene i.e. the desorbent vapours.
