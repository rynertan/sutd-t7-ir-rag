Thus, an 8 hydroxysubstituted benzazepine may be treated with acetone and chloroform in the presence of base see for example,Synthesis, 31 1977 1 to produce a carboxylate salt having the formula M O2C C CH3 2 O e wherein M represents one equivalent of a metal cation such as a sodium or a potassium cation which is derived from the particular base that was used in the reaction.Use of a base comprising a multivalent metal such as calcium will produce a corresponding salt, e.g. Ca O2C C CH3 2 O e 2 The so produced carboxylate salt may next be converted into the corresponding acid halide such as the acid chloride by treatment with for example thionyl chloride. The so produced acid halide may next be converted into the corresponding acid amide by treatment with concentrated ammonium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The soproduced acid amide having the formula H2NCO C CH3 2 O e may next be converted into the acylanilide having the formula HOC CH3 2CONH by treatment with a strong base in a suitable solvent, e.g. sodium hydride in N,Ndimethylformamide see for example Organic Reactions, 18, 99 1970 .The so obtained amide may then be converted to the corresponding amine, compound I wherein R2 R3 H, H2N by hydrolysis, especially with an acid, in particular mineral acid, for example with 50 sulfuric acid solution. If desired, the so obtained amine may be subjected to a number of finishing steps selected from steps a to p given above. For example, the elimination of a 7 halogen atom chloro, bromo or iodo can be effected by means of hydrogen and a catalyst, e.g. 20 palladium on charcoal, in an inert organic solvent such as a lower alkanol, e.g.ethanol or methanol. The oxidative condensation of an arylmethylthioether with a 7 unsubstituted 8 NH2 benzazepine can be effected using N chlorosuccinimide or especially t butyl hypochlorite as oxidising agent. The aryl group in the arylalkylthioether is preferably a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group a preferred ether is thioanisole. The reaction is preferably carried out at reduced temperature, e.g. at below 0 C., preferably at about 30 C., in an inert organic solvent which may comprise a haloalkane, e.g. a methylene chloride acetonitrile mixture. After basification e.g.with sodium in methanol and evaporation to dryness, the residue is heated in a basic medium, e.g. a tertiary organic base in an inert hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene. The resulting 7 arylthioalkyl benzazepine can then be reduced to the 7 alkyl benzazepine, e.g. with lithium aluminum hydride in an ethereal solvent or with catalytic reduction, e.g. with palladium on carbon or with Raney nickel. A so obtained amine H2N e may be reacted with an acylating agent such as ClSO2Ra, RaSO2NCO, RaNCO, RaCOCl, RaCO 2O, RaXCOCl or RaSO2 2O to produce the corresponding sulfonamide, sulfonylurea, acyl amide, urethane, or urea wherein Ra and X are as defined above . This reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an organic tertiary amine base such as triethylamine, N methyl morpholine or pyridine, or a weak inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate. Alternatively, compounds of the formula RaX.CO.NH wherein X is O or NRb may be prepared by reaction of H2N e with carbonyldiimidazole, followed by the in situ reaction of the intermediate urea with a primary or secondary alcohol or a primary or secondary amine.Reaction with ammonia will produce compounds wherein RaX is NH2. The acylamido derivatives having the formula CONH wherein Ra is as defined herein may be reduced with for example lithium aluminum hydride or diborane to produce a substituted amine RXNH Q wherein Rx may be chosen from those groups as defined herein for Ra, provided that m is not 0. Reduction of urethanes of the formula RaO.CO.NH e with reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride produces compounds of the formula CH3NH . If desired the so obtained amine RxNH may be acylated with an appropriate acylating agent as described above for the acylation of H2N e to produce the corresponding urethane or acylamido derivatives. The amides having the formula RaSO2NH e or RaCONH , may be alkylated by known procedures for example with an alkyl halide, such as RXBr, wherein RXis defined herein, in the presence of sodium hydride to produce a disubstituted amide having the structure CO.RxN or RaSO2.RxN These amides may be reduced with for example lithium aluminum hydride to produce the corresponding tertiary amine from the carboxamide or secondary amine RxNH from the sulfonamide . Alternatively, the carboxamide may be hydrolysed e.g. with a base or with acid to remove the acyl group RaCO and thereby produce the corresponding secondary amine RxNH . The so produced acylamido derivatives having the formula RaCO RxN wherein Ra and Rx may be the same or different and are as defined herein may be reduced with, for example lithium aluminum hydride or diborane to produce a disubstituted amine RaRXN wherein Ra and Rx may be the same or different and represent certain R2 and R3 substituents as defined herein. Reduction of urethanes of the formula RaO.CO.N Rx with reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride produces compounds of the formula RXCH3N . In the above described conversion sequences, the proper selection of the acylating agent e.g. RaCOCl and alkylating agent e.g. RxBr will permit the preparation of the desired compounds of formula I, i.e. RêR N Other methods for obtaining compounds of formula I, RêR N from compounds R NH , wherein Rê is Ra as defined above and R3 is Ra as defined above or a hydrogen atom, are well known in the art. Thus, for example, compounds R NH can be reductively alkylated with a suitable aldehyde or ketone such as RaCHO wherein Ra is as defined herein , in the presence of a reducing agent such as NaCNBH3 for example, in a suitable solvent such as methanol, to produce an amine having the structure RXR3N i wherein Rx and R3 may be the same or different and are as defined herein. When R3 is hydrogen, this procedure may be repeated to produce compounds RXR3N i wherein R3 is no longer a hydrogen atom and Rx and R3, which may be the same or different, are otherwise as defined herein. Compounds having structural formula I of the typeEMI13.1 may be prepared from compounds of formula I of the typeEMI13.2 by N methylation of the pyridine ring, for example with methyl iodide, followed by 1,4 reduction of the resultingN methyl pyridinium salt, for example with sodium dithionite in a suitable solvent such as aqueous ethanol. In order to obtain products of the invention of formula I wherein R2 is the group Aryl as hereinbefore defined, one may use the well known Chapman rearrangement Org. Reactions, 14, 1 1965 as exemplified below EMI14.1 wherein the group Aryl is as hereinbefore defined . Alternatively, the Goldberg diarylamine synthesis Berichte, 40, 4541 1907 using N acetyl derivatives may be employed EMI14.2 wherein the group Aryl is as hereinbefore defined. A compound having structural formula I, whereinR2 and R3 taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a ring, may be prepared from the corresponding compound having structural formula I wherein R2 and R3 are both hydrogen. For example, the primary amino compound may be reacted with an acylating agent such as an acid chloride having the structural formula L CH2 nCH2 YCH2COCl wherein L is a leaving group such as halogen and Y and n are as defined herein to produce the amides having the structural formula L CH2 nCH2YCH2CONH wherein L, Y and n are as defined herein. The amide may be reduced to the corresponding amine, for example with diborane, and cyclized by heating in the presence of an acid acceptor such as pyridine to produce the cyclic amine having the following structural formulaEMI15.1 The amides may also be cyclized, for example by use of sodium hydride, to produce the corresponding cyclic amides having the structural formulaEMI15.2 which may also be reduced, for example with lithium aluminum hydride, in an inert organic solvent, to produce the same cyclic amine described above. In order to obtain products of this invention having structural formula I wherein R5 and or R6 is hydroxy, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the oxygen substituent or substituents should be suitably protected during many of the above described chemical transformations. A convenient protecting group is for example the benzyl group, which can be removed by hydrogenolysis. The compounds of formula I can be isolated as their R or S enantiomers, especially if the starting material HO.C CH3 .CO.NH has the desired R or S configuration. Alternatively, they can be isolated as their racemates which, if desired, can be resolved by standard methods into the R and S enantiomers. The 8 hydroxy substituted benzazepine compounds HO may be prepared for example by methods described in U.S. Patent 3,393,192 or by variations thereof known in the art.

ANTIPSYCHOTIC POTENTIAL BLOCKADE OF AMPHETAMINE INDUCED LETHALITY IN AGGREGATED MICE Amphetamines are known to be more lethal in grouped than singly housed mice Psychopharmacologia, 1, 210 1960 . Standard antipsychotic drugs are potent antagonists of this aggregate toxicity Arch. Int.Pharmacodyn, 113, 290 1958 and the ability of drugs to antagonize amphetamine induced lethality is used to predict antipsychotic potency Arzneim. Forsch.,25, 1436 1975 . METHODS AND MATERIAL Methamphetamine was used to produce lethality in groups of ten mice housed in 11 x 26 x 13 cm.3 plastic chambers. Test drugs were administered 30 minutes prior to intraperitoneal injection of methamphetamine at 15 mg kg, a dose that typically killed at least 90 of the mice within 4 hours. The number of deaths in each group was recorded 4 hours after methamphetamine administration. The dose of each test compound that provided 50 protection ED50 and the 95 confidence limits 95 CL were determined using probit analysis.RESULTS A representative compound of the invention, R 8 amino 7 chloro 3 methyl 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine, caused dose related blockade of methamphetamine induced lethality of grouped mice and had an ED50 13.5 mg kg when given by the oral route. Representative compounds of the invention also displayed activity when tested as follows CONDITIONED AVOIDANCE SUPPRESSION IN RATS Clinically active antipsychotic drugs are known to depress discrete trial avoidance behavior at doses that do not retard escape responding Ann. N.Y. Acad.Sci., 66, 740 1957 . A series of experiments was carried out to assess the ability of the compounds of the invention to suppress the conditioned avoidance response CAR in rats.METHODS AND MATERIALS Rats were required to jump onto a platform located 17.15 cm. 6 3 4 inches above the grid floor of an experimental chamber in response to a 5 second tone to avoid a ten second foot shock 0.6 MA . Each experimental session consisted of 20 such trials presented at 30 second intervals. A correct CAR occurred whenever the rat jumped onto the platform during the tone prior to foot shock . An escape response occurred when the rat jumped onto the platform during shock. A response failure is defined as the lack of an escape response during the 10 second shock period. Groups of 6 8 rats were trained on two consecutive days total of 40 trials . Rats that reached criterion on day 2 correct CARs on 16 or more of the 20 trials were treated with either a test drug or a vehicle on day 3. Suppression of CAR was analyzed statistically using Student s t test comparing the performance of drugtreated to vehicle treated rats. The minimal effective dose MED for each drug is defined as the lowest dose tested that significantly P .05 reduced avoidance responding. RESULTS A representative compound of the invention, R 8 amino 7 chloro 3 methyl 1 phenyl 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 tetra hydro 1H 3 benzazepine, compound A, when tested by the above procedure, manifested a dose related specific blockade of conditioned avoidance responding with an MED of 2.5 mg kg orally at 1 and 4 hours after dosing. In this test, R 7 chloro 8 methanesulfonamido 3 methyl 1 phenyl 1 ,2,3,4 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine as maleate , compound B, and R 7 chloro 3 methyl 8 methylamino 1 phenyl 2,3 ,4 ,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine, compound C, had respective MEDs of 3 and 10 mg kg orally at 1 hour after dosing.BINDING TO D 1 RECEPTORS The foregoing tests indicate that compounds of formula I have potential as anti psychotic drugs. Such drugs usually act at D2 receptors, but are less active or not active at all at D1 receptors. Surprisingly, we have found that compounds of formula I act much more strongly at D1 receptors than at D2 receptors, as indicated by the following Table Ki nM Displacement of Reference Compound Test Compound 1 2 A 2.1 1,013 B 29 10,430 C 11 1,035Test compounds A, B and C as identified above.Reference compounds both tritium labelled 1 is 7 chloro 8 hydroxy 3 methyl 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazapine as maleate , which acts at D1 receptors 2 is spiperone, a known anti psychotic which acts at D2 receptors. The lower the figure in columns designated 1 and 2, the higher the activity of the test compound A, B or C the figure gives the concentration nM of test compound at the D1 or D2 receptors needed to displace 50 of the bound reference compounds 1 and 2 from their respective receptor sites. Hence the test compounds of formula I have a different profile of anti psychotic effect from known anti psychotics such as spiperone, and can thus be expected to lack many side effects associated with those compounds. ANTIDEPRESSANT POTENTIAL 1. EFFECTS ON TETRABENAZINE INDUCED PTOSIS IN MICE Clinically active antidepressant drugs are known to block tetrabenazine induced ptosis in mice Psychosomatic Medicine, Nodine and Moyer, Eds., Lea andFebiger, Philadelphia, 1962, pp 683 90 . Activity in this test is used to predict anti depressant activity in man.METHODS AND MATERIALS Groups of 5 mice were administered test drugs followed 30 minutes later by ip injection of tetrabenazine TBZ , 30 mg kg. Thirty minutes later, the degree of ptosis was evaluated. Percent blockade of each treated group was used to determine ED50 s, defined as that dose which prevents ptosis in 50 of mice. ED50 s and 95 confidence limits were calculated by probit analysis. RESULTS R 8 Amino 7 chloro 3 methyl 1 phenyl 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine, a representative compound of the invention, caused antagonism of TBZ induced ptosis in mice at an ED50 of 3 mg kg when administered orally.2. EFFECTS ON MURICIDE ACTIVITY IN RATS Blockade of muricide mouse killing activity in rats has been used as a measure of evaluating the anti depressant activity of drugs Int. J. Neuropharmacol., 5, 405 11 1966 . METHODS AND MATERIALS Groups of 5 rats were administered test drug intraperitoneally and tested 30 and 60 minutes later for presence of muricide activity. Percent blockade of each treated group using data obtained at both these time points was calculated and dose response data were used to determine each ED50. ED50 is defined as that dose which blocks muricide behavior in 50 of treated rats and was calculated using probit analysis.RESULTS A representative compound of this invention, R 8 amino 7 chloro 3 methyl 1 phenyl 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine, blocked muricide behavior at an ED50 of 2.7 mg kg. Pharmaceutical activity of the type described above is most pronounced for those compounds of the invention wherein the stereochemical configuration at the asymmetric carbon atom, i.e. carbon number 1 in structural formula I, is R. The compounds of the invention form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic, and the like. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt form with a base. For example, dilute aqueous base solutions may be utilized.Dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate solutions are suitable for this purpose. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. A solid carrier can comprise one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegrating agents it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In tablets the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted into the shape and size desired.The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 to about 70 percent, preferably from 10 to about 70 percent, of the active ingredient.Suitable solid carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, low melting waxes and cocoa butter. The active compound can also be formulated with encapsulating material as carrier to provide a capsule or cachet in which the active component with or without other carriers is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As examples there may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by adding the active ingredient to water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing, sweetening, solubilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active ingredient in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and other well known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, into liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These particular solid form preparations are most conveniently provided in unit dose form and as such are used to provide a single liquid dosage unit. Alternately, sufficient solid may be provided so that after conversion into liquid form, multiple individual liquid doses may be obtained by measuring predetermined volumes of the liquid form preparation as with a syringe, teaspoon or other volumetric container. When multiple liquid doses are so prepared, it is preferred to maintain the unused portion of said liquid doses at low temperature i.e., under refrigeration in order to retard possible decomposition.The solid form preparations intended for conversion to liquid form may contain, in addition to the active material, flavors, colorants, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents and the like. The solvent used for preparing the liquid form preparation may be water, isotonic water, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Naturally, the solvent used will be chosen with regard to the route of administration for example, liquid preparations containing large amounts of ethanol are not suitable for parenteral administration. The invention also contemplates mechanical delivery systems, e.g. for transdermal delivery. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form, each dose containing an appropriate quantity of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packaged tablets or capsules, or powders in vials or ampoules.The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active ingredient in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 100 mg. according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. The composition can, if desired, also contain other therapeutic agents. The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirement of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated and the particular compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art.Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.
