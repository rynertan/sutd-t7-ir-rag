## Description
MIDDLE DISTILLATE FUEL This invention is directed at the production of a fuel having improved low temperature flow properties. More specifically, the present invention is directed at improving the low temperature flowproper ties of a middle distillate fuel having an atmospheric boiling point ranging between about 1200C and about 4500CI In the production of middle distillate fuels, one of the major problems encountered is the formation of relatively large wax type crystals which may plug fuel lines and or fuel filters. While the consumption of gasoline is projected to show little, if any, growth in most industrial countries, the consumption of middle distillate fuels, particularly diesel fuel, is expected to increase significantly.Therefore, it would be advantageous to broaden the range of middle distillates which could be utilized as fuels. However, one significant barrier to broadening the boiling range of middle distillates utilized as fuels has been the poor low temperature flow properties of the middle distillates. At low temperatures paraffinic compounds present in the middle distillates, particularly normal paraffins, tend to precipitate, forming waxy compounds which tend to plug fuel lines and fuel filters. These problems tend to be particularly acute in diesel fuel, where the fuel filters frequently have openings of about 5 50 microns in diameter. Conventional pour depressants, such as those used in lube oils, may not be effective in fuels, since lubricating systems normally do not have filters with as fine a mesh as fuel systems. Much work has been done on improving the low temperature flow properties of hydrocarbons, such as lubricating oils and middle distillates. U. S. Patent No. 2,084,512 is directed at improving the pour point of a lubricating oil. This patent discloses the use of bright stocks in combination with a pour inhibitor, such as the low temperature aluminum chloride condensation of halogenated paraffin wax and naphthalene. However, it has been found that additives which are effective for pour point depression of a lube oil may not be effective for improving the low temperature flow properties of a middle distillate fuel. While acceptable pour point depression may be accomplished in a lube oil having relatively large wax crystals present, large wax crystals may plug the small pores of fuel filters. Considerable work also has been done to develop additives for middle distillate fuels which will improve the low temperature flow properties of the fuels. U. S. Patent No. 3,660,057 discloses the addition to a middle distillate of an essentially saturated hydrocarbon fraction substantially free of normal paraffinic hydrocarbons having a number average molecular weight range of about 600 to 3,000 in combination with a copolymer of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer, such as an unsaturated ester or an alpha olefin. This patent discloses in Table I that the finest screen through which the distillate fuel could be passed was a 40 mesh screen, which has openings of about 420 microns. U. S. Patent No. 3,832,150 discloses the use of recycle cat cycle oil in combination with ethylene and vinyl acetate as a pour depressant for middle distillate fuel oil boiling in the range of about 2500F and about 6700F. While this combination of additives permits middle distillate fuel oil to flow through openings 2,250 microns in diameter, it is not believed that this combination will improve the cold flow of the distillate fuels by reducing the size of the wax crystals so as to enable them to flow through the fine mesh filters commonly found on diesel engines. U. S. Patent No. 3,389,979 discloses the combination of ethylene vinyl acetate and a resin extracted from a hydrocarbon. While this combination is reported to improve the flow rate of hydrocarbon distillate fuels through a copper tubing it is not believed that this combination will improve the cold flow of distillates by reducing the size of the wax crystals formed to permit flow through the fine mesh filters associated with diesel engines. U. S. Patent No. 3,640,691 discloses the use of ethylene vinyl acetate and a normal paraffinic hydrocarbon in the C24 C40 range for use as a flow improver in tests utilizing screens having 570 micron diameter openings. While the use of this combination may have enabled middle distillate fuel to pass through coarse screens several hundred microns in diameter, it is not believed that this combination will permit flow through the fine mesh screens of diesel engines. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide an additive and a method for improving the low temperature flow properties of middle distillate fuels. It also would be advantageous to utilize a petroleum based additive generally available at petroleum refineries for improving the low temperature flow properties of middle distillate fuels. It also would be desirable to provide an additive which is relatively inexpensive and is readily available at many integrated refineries. It also would be advantageous to provide an additive which could be added directly to the middle distillate product without utilizing elaborate heating and or mixing systems. It would be a further advantage to provide an additive which did not significantly affect the combustion properties of the fuel. The present invention is directed at the addition to a middle distillate fuel of deasphalted residuum in combination with a copolymer to improve the low temperature flow properties of the fuel. The present invention is directed at a wax containing petroleum distillate fuel having a boiling range between about 1200C to about 4500C which has deasphalted residuum and a copolymer added thereto to improve its low temperature flow properties. The copolymer preferably is selected from the group of copolymers consisting of ethylene and vinyl acetate, and ethylene and vinyl chloride. The present invention also is directed at a method for improving the low temperature flow properties of a middle distillate fuel boiling in the range of about 120 C to about 45O0C, preferably in the range of about 1200C to about 4000C, more preferably in the range of about 120C to about 3700C, which comprises adding to the middle distillate fuel oil deasphalted residuum and a copolymer. The copolymer preferably is selected from the group of copolymers consisting of copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate and ethylene and vinyl chloride. In a preferred embodiment the deasphalted residuum added to the distillate fuel comprises below about 5 weight percent of the fuel, and preferably ranges between about 1 weight percent and about 3 weight percent of the middle distillate fuel. The copolymer added to the middle distillate fuel preferably comprises below about 0.5 weight percent of the fuel and preferably ranges between about 0.02 and about 0.15 weight percent of the fuel. The deasphalted residuum and the copolymer may be added to the distillate fuel at any point which will assure good mixing of the additive with the middle distillate fuel oil. The present invention is directed at improvement in the low temperature flow properties of middle distillates by promoting the formation of relatively small wax crystals from the precipitated wax. The present invention is directed at improving the cold flow properties of middle distillate fuels by the addition to the fuel of a deasphalted residuum, or deasphalted oil, and a copolymer. The copolymer preferably comprises a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate and or ethylene and vinyl chloride. As used herein, the term middle distillate fuels refers to fuels having an atmospheric boiling point ranging between about 1200C and about 4500C, preferably between about 1200C and about 4000C, and more preferably between about 1200C and about 37O0C. Commonly used middle distillate fuels comprise diesel fuel, Number 2 fuel oil, kerosene, and turbine fuel.The term deasphalted residuum or deasphalted oil refers to hydrocarbon bottoms from an atmospheric and or vacuum pipestill which have had the asphaltenic components at least partially removed. Methods for producing a deasphalted residuum are well known in the art and do not form a part of this invention.Deasphalting commonly is conducted by contacting the residuum with an alkane solvent selected from the group consisting of propane, butane, pentane and hexane.While the deasphalting process normally reduces theConradson carbon content and the metals content of the deasphalted oil significantly, the actual degree to which these are removed by the deasphalting process will be a function of many factors, including the crude processed, the Conradson carbon content and metals content of the residuum, the solvent utilized, the feed throughput rate and the solvent addition rate. Although much work has been directed at the use of compounds to depress the pour point of middle distillate fuels, pour point depressant tests have not been particularly useful in predicting the performance of middle distillate fuels at low temperatures. While the pour point measures the lowest temperature at which a fuel may still flow, it has been found that this measure of a fuel is not a reliable indication of the degree to which the fuel will flow through the relatively small pores of a fuel filter.Since the openings in an automobile fuel filter typically may range between about 5 and about 50 microns, and the openings in screens of fuel heating systems may range between about 400 and about 1,000 microns, it is essential that the crystals of wax formed, if any, be relatively small so that they do not plug the openings in the filters. A test has been devised which has been found to be a relatively accurate indicator of cold flow performance of fuels in passing through filter media.In this test, designated as the Low TemperatureFilterability Test LTFT , 200 ml of the test fuel is cooled at a rate of 20F hour to the desired test temperature and subsequently passed through a screen having openings of 17 microns diameter under a vacuum of 20 kPa. The fuel is determined to pass the test only if all of the test fuel that can pass through the screen, passes through the screen in one minute. If any of the of test fuel that should pass through the screen has not passed through the screen in one minute, the test is designated a failure. This test procedure is described in more detail at page C 15 in CRC ReportNo. 528, entitled CRC Diesel Fuel Low TemperatureOperability Field Test , September, 1983, published byCoordinating Research Counsel, Atlanta, Georgia, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. One measure of the effectiveness of an additive in improving the low temperature flow properties of a middle distillate fuel is the degree to which the fuel flows at temperatures below the cloud point, i.e., the lower the temperature below the cloud point at which the fuel passes the LTFT test, the better the additive in improving the low temperature flow properties of the fuel. As shown in Table I below, for a diesel fuel having a OOF cloud point, the combination of 2 weight percent deasphalted residuum in combination with 0.06 weight percent copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate produces acceptable LTFT results at temperatures as low as 100F, whereas the addition of 3 weight percent deasphalted residuum, or 0.2 weight percent of ethylene and vinyl acetate copolymer alone to fuel produced unacceptable test results at only 40F. The diesel fuel employed had a boiling range of 0 171 to 343 C. The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer had a number average molecular weight of approximately 1800.

The ethylene vinyl chloride copolymer had a number average molecular weight of approximately 2500.

The flow improvers that are employed in this invention are of the type comprising a copolymer of ethylene and at least one second unsaturated monomer.The second unsaturated monomer can be another monoolefin, e.g., a C3 to C16 alpha monoolefin, or it can be an unsaturated ester, as for example vinyl acetate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl propionate, lauryl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate or the like. SeeCanadian Patent Nos. 676,875 and 695,679 . Other monomers include N vinyl pyrrolidone. See CanadianPatent No. 658,216 . The second monomer can also be a mixture of unsaturated mono or diester and a branched or straight chain alpha monoolefin. Mixtures of copolymers can also be used, as for example a mixture of a copolymer of ethylene and vinylacetate with an alkylated polystyrene or acylated polystyrene. SeeU. S. Patent Nos. 3,037,850 and 3,069,245 . Stated more generally, the copolymer useful in this invention will consist essentially of about 3 to 40, and preferably 3 to 20, molar proportions of ethylene per molar proportion of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, which latter monomer can be a single monomer or a mixture of such monomers in any proportion, said polymer being oil soluble and having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 1,000 to 50,000, preferably about 1,500 to about 5,000 molecular weight. Molecular weights can be measured by vapor phase osmometry, for example by using a MechrolabVapor Phase Osmometer Model 310A. The unsaturated monomers, copolymerizable with ethylene, include unsaturated acids, acid anhydrides, and mono and diesters of the general formula EMI11.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl R2 is a OOCR4, or COOR4 group wherein R4 is hydrogen or a C1 to Clo, more usually a C1 to C4 straight or branched chain alkyl group and R3 is hydrogen or COOR4. The monomer, when R1 to R3 are hydrogen and R2 is 00CR4 includes vinyl alcohol esters of C2 to. C17 monocarboxylic acids. Examples of such esters include vinyl acetate, vinyl isobutyrate, vinyl laurate, vinyl myristate, vinyl palmitate, etc.When R2 is COOR4 such esters include C8 Oxo alcohol acrylate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, palmityl alcohol ester of alpha methyl acrylic acid, C13 Oxo alcohol esters of methacrylic acid, etc. Examples of monomers wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 and R3 are OOCR4 groups, include mono C13 Oxo alcohol fumarate, di C13 Oxo o alcohol fumarate, diisopropyl maleate, dilauryl fumarate, ethyl methyl fumarate, fumaric acid, maleic acid, etc. Other unsaturated monomers copolymerizable with ethylene to prepare pour point depressants or flow improvers useful in this invention include C3 to C16 branched chain or straight chain alpha monoolefins, as for example propylene, n octene l, 2 ethyldecene l, n decene l, etc. Small proportions, e.g., about 0 to 20 mole percent, of a third monomer, or even of a fourth monomer, can also be included in the copolymers, as for example, a C3 to C16 branched or straight chain alpha mono olefin, e.g., propylene, n octene l, n decene l, etc. Thus, for example, a copolymer of 3 to 40 moles of ethylene with one mole of a mixture of 30 to 99 mole percent of unsaturated ester and 70 to 1 mole percent of olefin could be used. The copolymers that are formed are random copolymers consisting primarily of an ethylene polymer backbone along which are distributed side chains of hydrocarbon or oxy substituted hydrocarbon. The concentration of each of the components added to the middle distillate fuel should be sufficiently low that it does not cause a significantly adverse effect on the combustion properties of the fuel oil. Moreover, since the cost of copolymer is substantially higher than the cost of the deasphalted residuum, the minimum quantity of copolymer should be utilized which will give the desired cold flow properties. The quantity of the deasphalted residuum added to the fuel should be maintained below about 5 weight percent, preferably within the range of about i weight percent to about 3 weight percent of the fuel. The quantity of the copolymer added to the fuel should generally be maintained below 0.5 weight percent, preferably within the range of about 0.02 to about 0.15 weight percent. The point at which the deasphalted residuum and copolymer are added to the fuel is not critical. A preferred method would be to pre mix both components and add this mixture during the final blending of the product, although it would be possible to add the components either singly or in combination at other points in the manufacture or distribution process. The preferred method would facilitate the relatively uniform distribution of the small quantity of copolymer in the fuel.
