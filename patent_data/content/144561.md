# Toothed reluctance synchro resolver.

## Abstract
A synchro resolver in which a plurality of primary windings and secondary windings are wound on separate stator pole pieces 16, 20 having projecting teeth 24, 26 with the stator poles of the secondary windings being located between the stator pole pieces of the primary windings and further including a rotor with teeth 28, 30 which are juxtaposed to the stator teeth 24 for differentially coupling magnetic flux generated in the primary windings to the secondary windings as a function of the position of the rotor s teeth vis a vis the stators teeth.
