## Description
METHOD AND MACHINE FOR AUTOMATICALLY CLOSING THE TOESOF HOSIERY The present Invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for use in manufacturing hosiery, i.e. socks, stockings, pantihose and boot liners, and more especially for use in manufacturing high quality socks and stockings. It is common practice to knit hose in a tubular, open ended form and then to close one end, namely the toe, by seaming. Better quality hose are so knitted as to produce a shaped or reinforced heel portion. The toe seam should then bear some definite orientatiol relationship to the heel, depending on the hose design and the particular form which the toe seam takes. Figs. 1A and 1B of the accompanying drawings show a hose 1 from the side and from beneath, respectively, in each case laid out flat. The toe seam 2 has a particular orientation relationship to the heel portion 3, such that when this hose is worn with the wearer s heel embraced by the heel portion 3, the toe seam 2 lies approximately across the ends of the toes. In this exemplary hose, a fishmouth seam is used. This is symmetrical about the longitudinal centre line 4 of the hose and so is the heel portion 3. In Getaz and underfoot seams, the seam may lie in a plane perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 1B, this plane desirably containing the centre line 4. Such seams should therefore be aligned with centre line 4.Irrespoctive of the seam shape, there should always be a definite, specific relationship betlRreen seam and heel portion. To attain the desired relationship, hose must always be inserted into a seamer with the heel portion in a predetermined attitude. This could be done manually quite successfully, provided there is time available for the operator to make such adjustments as necessary. The desire for ever higher production rates has led to the development of automatic machinery capable of seaming 420 to 600 dozen pairs of hose per 8 hour shift, Such a machine is the Detexomat Speedomatic NS o At production speeds of this level there is too little time for an operator to feed the hose to the machine and then to adjust the hose properly.Thus, it is well nigh impossible for anyone to produce toe seamed hose consistently having the desired toe and heel relationship. The present invention aims to remedy the problem of attaining consistently seamed hose of the type described above and provides an automatic method and apparatus wherein the heel is adjusted to a predetermined orientation before seaming is commenced, this orientation being retained until the toe closing operation has commenced. According to this invention, there is provided a method of automatically closing the toes of hosiery, wherein a tubular hose blank having a shaped and or reinforced heel is mounted on a carrier, a toe end portion of the blank mounted on the carrier is caused t adopt a laterally spread flat condition and in this condition is moved past a seamer which generates a toe seam of a predetermined outline across the toe eid portion, characterised in that a driven member is brought into engagement with the toe end portion after mounting on the carrier and said toe end portion is rotate thereby around the carrier until the said toe end portion and the heel are in a predetermined attitude upon the carrier, the resulting mutual orientation of the toe end portion and heel being preserved in the course of spreading the toe end portion flat and seaming. The invention also provides a machine for automatically closing the toes. of hosiery supplied in open ended tubular form having shaped and or reinforced heels, the machine being of the type having a seamer, means for moving a flattened hose toe end past the seamer to generate a toe closing seam of predetermined outline therein, and a carrier to support the hose on the machine, the machine being characterised by means movable into and out of engagement with the toe end portion of a hose on the carrier, prior to movement of the toe end past the seamer, and operative to rotate the toe end portion around the carrier and with it the heel, and by control means including a sensor located at a set, datum position with respect to the carrier, the control means being operable to effect a discontinuation of rotation of the toe end portion when the latter has been rotated to bring an identifiable feature therein into alignment with the aensor. A A. preferred machine according to the invention has a seamer, movable clamp means for gripping a flattened hose toe end and for moving it past the seamer to generate a toe closing seam therein, a carrier to support the hose on the machine and means operable to advance a toe end portion of the hose from the carrier into the clamp means, the machine further including a rotationally driven member mounted for movement into and out of engagement with the toe end portion supported on the carrier, prior to advance thereof into the clamp means, for rotating the toe end portion when engaged thereby around the carrier and with it the heel, and rotation control means including a sensor located at a set, datum position with respect to the carrier, the said control means being operable to effect a discontinuation of rotation of the toe end portion when the latter has been rotated to bring an identifiable feature therein into alignment with the sensor. The identifiable feature is provided in the hose, by the hosiery manufacturer, in a predetermined position relative to the heel. When the sensor responds upon alignment of the said feature therewith, it may produce a signal which, for instance, is responsible for disengaging the rotationelly driven member from the toe end portion so that the latter uneases rotating around the carrier. The signal could be arranged to arrest driving of the rotationally driven member instead.Wring to the said feature being fixed relative to the heel and the sensor being in a set datum posi t ion, the heel will be in a prescribed attitude on the carrier when the rotationally dri v en member is either disengaged from the hose toe end portion as preferred , or lts drive is arrested. The said feature can take a variety of forms. For instance, it may be a knitted band contrasting in colour from the remainder of the hose knit, or a band of dropped or transferred stitches. The carrier can be a tubular member useful for everting hose, as is known. The toe advancing means can be a pair of fingers or blades which advantageously move apart inside the hose toe end portion to spread the latter flat for entry into the clamp means. The fingers are arranged also to execute a movement towards, into and then away from the clamp means for depositing the toe end in the clamp means. Friction between the toe end portion and the fingers preserves the orientation between the toe end portion and the heel set by the rotationally driven member. Conveniently, tut not necessarily, the fingers are mounted on the carrier for movement lengthwise thereof during the operation of depositing the toe end in the clamp means. The invention will now be described in more detail by lay of example with reference to the remainingFigures of the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 2 is a simplified perspective view, showing the principal elements of a toe closing machine to which this invention is applicable, Fig. 3 is a schematic end elevation of a turret of a known Detexomat machine, and illustrates the ,sork stations through which each hose to be seamed is sequentially conveyed, Pig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 3 showing a machine according to the invention, Fig. 5 is an exploded perspective view of a machine according to the invention, illustrating equipment for attaining a predetermined heel position prior to seaming, and Fig. 6 is an end elevation view showing control cam means for maintaining the predetermined position in the course of presenting hose toes to a seamer. The basic machine to be described for convenience is a development or modification of a known Detexomat toe loser, i.e. the Speedomatic HS toe closer. Special equipment to be described is fitted to the machine for adjusting hose blanks accurately to attain a predetermined orientation relationship between heel portion and toe seam in the finished hose. The Speedomatic H2lmachine is disclosed in our U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,577,758 to which reference is hereby directed. To seam the toe ends o open ended hose blanks, the machine 5 is fitted with a sewing and trimming machine 6 e.g. a Union Special 39500 machine. By moving Åa toe end along a predetermined path past the sewing machine needle, a seam of the desired shape, e.g. a fish mouth, is produced. Intermittently operable clamp means 7 serves to grip the toe end to be seamed and then to move it past the needle. Clamp means 7 comprises an endless, intermittently driven belt 8 and a work table 9 which extends to the sewing machine sewing head. The belt 8 is trained around pulley wheels, not should, sore of which are adjustable to determine the shape of the seam generated.The principle of operation of the clamp means 7 is described in our U.K. Patent 1,501,869 to which reference is directed for details. As described in this patent, the clamp opens to admit hose blanks for seaming and subsequently for releasing the seamed hose and closes to clamp toe ends and then move them past the sewing machine by raising and lowering the belt bodily relative to a stationary ork table. In the present machine 5, the table instead is lowered and raised to open and close the clamp means 7, the table being pivotally mounted on a pillar 10. The machine 5 is furnished with turret mounted tubular hose carriers 12 and means for automatically advancing toe ends of hose disposed on the carriers 12 into the clamp means 7. There are ten carriers 12 on the turret 1 , only two being shorn for clarity in Fig. 2.Turret 11 is punted to rotate, or index, steppe causing each carrier 12 to sweep intermittently around a circular. or cylindrical path 14. Drive means for the turret 11 are hosed within a cabinet 15. The toe end advancing means course reciprocally movable fingers 16, a pair thereof being mounted on each carrier 12 in this particular machine. The fingers 16 are in the form of flat, spaced apart blades which may spread apart in the course of transferring hose toe ends into the clamp means 7. The toe ends are presented to the clamp means 7 in a flat condition. A cycle of operations of the Speedomatic HS machine 1ill now be described with reference to Fig. 3.During one full cycle, each tubular carrier 12 moves intermittently, pausing at each of ten stations I X. When a carrier 12 arrives at Station I, the operator loads a hose blank thereon. Carrier 12 is in communication with a source of suction to assist eversion of the blank in knoll manner. The welt end of the blank is turned back over the carricr 12 arid manually dratm along the carrier, this and finger blades 16 being disposed inside the blank. The turret is then indexed to cause each carrier to rotate through 360 to the next station. Upon arrival at station II a wind on mechanism including a rotationally driven roller 20 is actuated to engage the hose blank and draw it fully onto the carrier 12. Qnaen the toe end of the blade passes a photo sensor 21, roller 20 is moved out of contact with the blank. Having indexed to station III, the hose blank toe end portion is positioned longitudinally. The object is to adjust the actual toe end accurately upon the finger blades 16 such that upon transfer to the clamp means 7 it will be fed thereby past the seamer to generate a seam in the requisite location. The positioner 23 is moved into engagement with the hose blank while stationary at station III, and then shifts its toe end portion firstly away from the turret 11 and then back again. In the course of the latter movement, some discernable feature on the toe end portion approaches a photo sensor 24, the said feature being some predetermined distance from the desired position of the seam to be generated Men the photo sensor 24 detects the said feature, it produces a signal for discz irM the positioner 23 from the blank. The said feature can be a control mark, e.g. a coloured thread or a band of dropped stitches, the extreme end of the blank or the boundary between a reinforced toe knit and the adjacent knit of the blank.The toe end portion is in the correct longitudinal position on the blades 16, when the positions 23 is disengaged by the sensor signal, to swithin 3 mm. when the correctly positioned hose blank arrives at station IV, its toe end portion is transferred to the clamp means 7 Transfer is achieved by the pair of finger blades 16 moving in unison relative to carrier 12, away from the turret 11 and into the open clamp means 7. The free ends of blades 16 can optionally spread apart, stretching the toe end laterally. Clamp means 7 then closes, nipping both toe end and blades 16. The latter then withdraw towards the turret 11, leaving the toe end in the clamp means.Also, after clamp means 7 has grasped the toe end, the belt 8 is set in motion to slide tie toe end across work table 9 to a position adjacent the sewing machine head. It will be seen that at station IV, the carrier 12 is at top dead centre and its blades are horizontally disposed. This horizontal attitude is necessary since the wonk table 9 is itself horizontal in the closed condition of the clamp. After arrival at station V a toe closing seam is generated by the sewing machine as the toe end is moved in unison with belt 8. Thereafter the seamed hose still on carrier 2 is conveyed to station VI, the hose arriving with its toe end portion dangling from carrier. At station VI, a driven wind on roller 26 engages the hose length on the carrier 12 and draws the hose fully onto the carrier 12. This action tends to straighten the toe seam. Subsequently, the hose passes through spare stations VII and VIII to station IX. At the latter station a reverse driven wind off roller 27 is engaged with the hose on carrier 12 and suction is applied through the carrier. The hose is dran toe end first into the carrier 12 by the suction assisted by roller 27, and is then discharged from the machine. During this sucking in action, the hose is automatically reverted. After passing through spare station X, the unloaded carrier 12 returns to station I to be loaded with a fresh hose blank by the operator once again. The present machine differs from theSpeedomatic l s machine in one importart operatio al respect it is arranged to position the heel portion automatically such that the requisite, predetermined .cd orientation relationship between heel and toe seam is always attained. Heel positioning takes place at e.g.station IV. Presentation of the toe end to the clamp means 7, and generation of the toe closing seam, are both performed at station V. Otherwise, the operating cycle see Fig. 4 is substantially as described above in relation to the Speedomatic 113 machine. The heel positioning means 30, is shown inFig. 5. Essentially, means 30 comprises a padded resilient roller 31 having its central axis parallel to the length of carrier 12. The roller 31 is journalled on a bracket arm 32 pivoted upon a pillar 33 which, in turn, is fixedly mounted in a manner not shorn to machine cabinet 15. A double acting pneumatic jack 34 is coupled between the arm and a bracket 35 on the pillar 33. The jack 34 is operable to swing the pivoted bracket arm 32 to and fro to engage and disengage the roller 31 with a toe end portion of a hose mounted on carrier 12.The roller is shoal in its disengaged position in Fig. 5 and in its engaged position in Figs.4 and 6. A drive motor, nbt should, is coupled directly or indirectly to roller 31 to rotate the latter at least whelp engaged with the hose. The roller 31 can be continuously or discontinuously driven. lNlen in engagement with the hose toe portion, roller 31 causes the latter to slide around the carrier and the blades , until a signal is produced by a photo sensor 36. The signal to disengage the roller 31 from the hose toe portion is generated by the sensor 36 when an indicating mark on the hose aligns therewith. The indicating mark can be knitted into the hose using a contrasting thread. This mark is in a predetermined position with respect to the hose heel portion. Omen the photo sensor 26 is correctly set upS the heel positioning means 30 will locale the heel accurately in such an attitude that the ultimately generated toe seam is in a prescribed orientation relationship with the heel. For example, it may be arranged that the heel is centred on a radial plane extending from the turret turning Sxis through the central axis of the carrier 12. After positioning, the heel may be centred atop or beneath carrier 12 as viewed in Fig. 6. Obviously, it is essential that the adjusted position of the heel is preserved when the toe end is transferred to the clamp means 7 and fed to the sei machine 6. No loss of adjustment is observed with the present carrier and finger blade arranoement from inadvertent rotation of the toe end portion around the carrier and blades. In the Speedomatic HS machines, the blades 16 are always perpendicular to the aforementioned radial plane, this condition being observed at each of the stations I to XL At station IV where the blades 16 transfer the toe end into the clamp means, they lie in horizontal plane to suit the horizontal claulping gap between belt 8 and horizontal work table In the present machine heel pcsitioning is performed at station IV, and toe end transfer and seaming at station V. Again, the clamping gap and work table 9 are horizontal. With the Speedomatic HSj the Wades 16 would lie in a plane tilted 360 from the horizontal at station V.This tilting would not suit the clamp means 7 in the present machine, which thus includes means for rotating the carrier 12 together with blades 16 about the carrier axis between stations IV and Y. In the result, the blades 16 are disposed horizontally at station V, set Figs. 5 and 6. As shown in these drawings, each carrier 12 is mounted to rotate against spring bias, not shown, in a boss 40 fast with turret 11 The blades 16 are mounted at their turret ends on a slide 41 and are slidably received in a slit between pairs of wings 42 one only shown fast with the carrier 12 adjacent its free end.The slide 41 has two cam followers 43, 44 which run in o tracks 4 6, 47 of an annular, non rotatably mounted cam disc 48. Track 46 is formed in the face of cam disc 48 and track 47 in its periphery. The cam disc 48 has a section 50 disposed between stations IV and V tshich can be moved fomzardly out of the plane of the remainder of the cam disc. Cam track 47 is coplanar with the cam disc 48 throughout the circumference of the latter. Thus, cam follower 44 will not be displaced to or fro relative to turret as it runs around track 47, excepts will be descxibed hereafter. Cam track 46 As of cardiod form. It is of constant radius except in the section 50 and in the region thereof, where its profile is designed to deflect carrier and blades about the carrier axis. Except when travelling along track portion 46 in section 50, cam follower 43 remains undeflected the blades 16 stay perpendicular to the aforementioned radial plane. When each carrier is shifted from stationIV upon indexing of the turret 11, cam follower 43 rides along track portion 46 and is so deflected that the slide 41 is rotated relative to the carrier axis.Since the blades 16 are fastened to the slide 41 and by wings 42 to the rotatable carrier 12 journalled in boss 40 , the blades 16 and carrier are rotated in unison about the carrier axis. By the time carrier 12 reaches station V, rotation thorough 360 will have been achieved and the blades 16 will be in a common horizontal plane. When tb.e turret 11 next indexes, the carrier and blades move towards station VI and attitude of the latter is returned to the normal attitude perpendicular to the said radial plane as the cam follower 43 continues moving along cam track 46 , 46. This is accompanied by a return rotation of the carrier 12 in the boss 49. The return rotation is spring assisted. When the carrier has reached station V or shortly before, the blades 16 must commence their to and fro excursion along the carrier 12 to transfer a hose toe end into the clamp means 7. This excursion is accomplished by shifting cam section 50 forward and back with respect to the remainder of cam disc 48.Movement of the cam section 50 is coupled to the blades 16 by cam track 47, cam follower 44 and slide 41. The blade exclusion commences while tbe blades 16 are nearing the horizontal under control. of cam track section 45t. Forward and reverse movement of cam disc sects.on SO is produced by a push pull rod 51 and a linkage 52 coupled through a cam follower 53 to a control cam 54. The latter is moved in timed relation with the indexing turret, and may be fast for rotation there with. Any convenient linkage 52 ill suffice, and that shown diagrammatically is merely exemplary. For ease of servicing, reliability and economy the principal elements and operations of the machine are controlled and timed mechanically from a single drive motor which rotates the turret 11. Extensive use is made of cam actuators, for example for rotating the turret 11, moving the cam disc portion 50 to and fro raising and lowering work table 9 of the clamp means and moving wind on rollers 20, 26 into and out of engagement with the hose. Supplementary motors can be used to rotate rollers 20, 26, 27 and 31, and to drive the clamp belt 8 intermittently. Operation of the positioning means 23 can be as described in our U.K. Patent Spqcifintion No. l,577, 8. Control valving for controlling supply of air to the operating jack 34 of the heel positioning means 30 can be conventional and conventionally actuated in response to indexing movement of the turret 11. In the machine particularly described with reference to Figs. 4 to 6, means necessarily had to be provided to rotate the carrier and finger blades, to matc j the horizontal attitude of the clamp means, because trans fer is accomplished at station V. The carrier and blade rotation means could be omitted in a modified design. This would be possible in principle if the operations performed at the various stations were displaced one position anticlockatise, as viewed in Fig. 4. Then, the operator would load at station X. Winding on would take place at station I and longitudmal positioning at station II. Heel positioning would take place at station III and transfer at stationIV, scanning likewise being performed t this station if desired. Since station IV is at top dead centre , the blades will be horizontal and hence will already be in an attitude suiting the clamp means. It is to be uitderstood that the invention has been described as applied to a Speedoma tic E machine purely for convenience. The heel positioning means can be incorporated in or installed on any automatic toe closer having one or more hose carriers around which the hose can be caused to rotate. As identifiable features, to which the sensor of the heel positioner is responsive, contrasting threads and bands of dropped or transferred stitches have been mentioned Instead, an inked datum mark could be applied to the hose, In some cases, exemplified particularly by patterned socks, it may be difficult for the photo sensor to distinguish between the pattern and marks of the sort mentioned above. The mark could then be characterised by a dyestuff which contrasts clearly with the surrounding fabric oihen illuminated by radiation of a particular wavelength, e.g. ultra violet light, the spectral range of the sensor of course being chosen to suit.Dyestuffs which fluoresce infer ultra violet light may be employed. The mark could be provided by a band of metal threads, the sensor then rcsponding to the difference in reflectance between the said band and the adjacent fabric. There metallic threads are used, a photo sensor could conceivably be replaced by circuitry which de tects the completion of an electric circuit between a feelci , the threads and e carrier, the feeler being located at the set datum position. A rotationally driven wheel or roller is not indispensible for rotating the hose toe end portion around the carrier when heel positioning. In place of such a member, an endless driven belt trained around pulleys and mounted for movement into and out of contact with the hose could be substituted. Alternatively, use could be made of a member such as a bar which, after being engaged with the carrier mounted hose, is displaced laterally relative to the carrier to cause the desired rotation of the hose. The turret of the machine described above rotates stepwise from station to station. Toe closers are known, however, in which the turret carriers are always in motion. The present invention can be applied to such toe closers by mounting the heel positioning equipment on a movable support for travel in unison with each of the carriers in turn during the positioning operation.
