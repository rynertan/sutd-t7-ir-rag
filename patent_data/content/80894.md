# RACKS FOR NUCLEAR FUEL ELEMENTS

## Abstract
A rack for nuclear fuel elements includes an outer container 36 within which is a plate assembly comprising a plurality of first plates 16, 10 of boron steel extending substantially parallel to one another and a plurality of second plates 18, 10 of boron steel extending substantially parallel to one another but substantially perpendicular to the first plates. The first and second plates together define a plurality of substantially rectangular section cavities, each of which is adapted to receive a nuclear fuel element, Each pair of first and second plates which together partially define one of the cavities is either integral or mechanically interlocked by a plurality of projections on the edge of one of the plates which extend into corresponding apertures in the other plate. The outer container engages the plate assembly and thereby retains the plates in their relative positions and imparts rigidity and mechanical strength to the assembly.
