# Addition agents for addition of alloying ingredients to molten metals.

## Abstract
An addition agent and method are provided for adding at least one alloying ingredient to a molten metal bath. The addition agent comprises a P M compact formed of a com pacted mixture comprising a particulate primary addition alloy .e.g. a conventional ferroalloy for use in molten steel baths and at least one secondary particulate component which is an addition to the molten metal i.e. results in adding to the metal bath at least one additive component and or diluent for the molten metal, rather than adding impurity , and which can react exothermically with the primary addition alloy when the addition agent is added to the molten metal bath, to assist the dissolution of the components in the bath. In one embodiment, the primary addition alloy is a ferroalloy such as ferroniobium having at least one eutectic and at least one intermetallic compound Feâ‚‚Nb in the case of fer roniobium , and the secondary component is a metal of the ferroalloy selected so as to combine exothermically with uncombined metal in the primary alloy to produce the inter metallic compound. Thus, in accordance with this embodi ment, where the primary component is a ferroniobium of normal commercial composition, which contains uncom bined niobium, the secondary component would be iron.
