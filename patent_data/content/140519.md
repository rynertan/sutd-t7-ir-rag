## Description
USE OF CHELATING AGENTS IN WATER DESALINATION Background of the Invention This invention relates to an improvement in processes for the desalination of water Water is a ubiquitous chemical substance on the planet earth,. and it is essential for sustaining life as we know it Indeed, approximately 70 of the earth is covered with water 140 million square miles and the total volume of this surface water is approximately 330 million cubic miles Additionally water is a very powerful solvent, particularly for ionic, polar chemicalsr and therefore much of the water. existing on the earth has varying amounts of dissolved solids, particularly salt sodium chloride .For example the large oceans, such as the Atlantic and pacific Oceans, have approximately 35,000 parts per million ppm of dissolved soLids, mainly sodium chloride. For a variety of purposes, it is often necessary to reduce substantially the amount of dissolved salt in a given supply of water. For example, it is necessary to reduce the salt concentration of water to about 500 ppm, or lower, in order to render it potable for human use, and sometimes the salt content of industrial waste. water must be reduced before the waste water can be returned. to rivers or aquifers The removal of salt from a water supply is known as desalination, and there are two major types of methods for the desalination of water these are evaporative processes and membrane processes. Desalination processes produce water having a lower salt content than the feed water, and, as a consequence, they produce water having an increased salt content than the feed water as a by product.when desalinating water containing hardness ions erg. 2e and Ca2 , this leads to a major problem of scale build up. In evaporative desalination processes, the scale deposits on surfaces in heater chambers,. thereby inhibiting heat transfer which lowers efficiency In membrane desalination processes, scale deposits on the membrane, thereby reducing its permeability and therefore its effectiveness In the past, one solution to scale build up has been to add an antiscalant to the saline water, and in this regard certain low molecular weight maleic acid acrylamide styrene terpolymers and low molecular weight polymers and copolymers of certain organic, unsaturated carboxylic acids are particularly useful.However, it has been found that if small amounts of certain transition metal ions e.g. Foe3 are present the effect of the antiscalant is decreased and scale build up occurs. Accordingly it is an object of this invention to decrease the adverse effect of the transition metal ions on the antiscalant, and by so doing increasing desalination efficiency Summary of the Invention In water desalination processes, in which the saline water contains hardness ions and a low molecular weight maleic acid acrylamide styrene terpolymer or a low molecular weight polymer or copolymer of an organic, unsaturated carboxylic acid e.g an acrylic acid polymer is being used to prevent scale build up i.e as an antiscalant , the further presence of transition metal ions, e.g Fe3 , Cu2 or Uni2 , leads to decreased efficiency of the antiscaIant.. However it has now been found that addition of an effective amount of a chelating agent to the saline water before, or at the same time as, addition of the antiscalant decreases the effect of the transition metal ions and restores efficiency of the antiscalant.Typical chelating agents which can be used include citric acid, gluconic acid and hydroxyethylidenedi phosphonic acid The chelating agent is used in an amount substantially sufficient to chelate. all the transition metal ions Detailed Description of the Invention Major methods for water desalination fall into two categories, evaporative processes and membrane processes Evaporative processes include flash evaporation FE , multiple effect distillation MED and vapor compression VC , while membrane processes include reverse osmosis RO and electrodialysis Flash evaporation consists of introducing heated saline water into a chamber at a lower pressure, such that part of the saline water vaporizes, often with extreme vigor The vapors thus obtained are condensed and collected by allowing them to come in contact with a number of condensing tubes through which is flowing further cold saline water which is to be desalinated.In this way, the latent heat of condensation of the desalinated water vapor is used to preheat the incoming saline water feed. Such a process is called single stage flash evaporation In multistage flash evaporation NFE , a large number of single stage evaporators are assembled in series, such that successively lower flashing pressures are used, and at each stage the condensing of the vapors is used to heat the incoming feed In multiple effect distillation, steam is condensed on one side of a tube and the latent heat of condensation derived. from this is used to evaporate saline water on the other side of the tube wall. The vapors so produced are then allowed to condense on a further wall and in so doing the latent heat of condensation again evaporates further saline water on the other side of this latter wall.Each of these fresh water condensation saline water evaporations is called an effect Several effects are arranged in series to make up a multiple effect distillation apparatus. Vapor compression is similar to multiple effect distillation except that it does not use an external heat source, such as steam, as its primary energy for distillation. Instead it relies on compressing water vapor to increase its pressure and therefore its condensation temperature Condensation takes place on one side of a tube, which acts as a heat transfer surface, and feed saline water is applied to the other side of the heat transfer surface, usually as a film.The latent heat of condensation vaporizes the saline water film . In reverse osmosis or hyper filtration , saline water is forced through a semipermeable membrane by application of a pressure which is in excess of the osmotic pressure of the water being desalinatedEssentially salt free water passes through the membrane and is coIlected, leaving more concentrated saline water behind In electrodialysis , a series of essentially parallel sheets of membranes are inserted into saline water, thus making a series of compartments. Two types of membranes are used, one type will allow the passage of anions but not cations while the other type will allow the passage of cations but not anions. These two types of membranes alternate. Two electrodes one positive and one negative are then placed one at each side of the vessel containing the saline water divided into compartments, and a different effect is observed in alternating compavtments. In one alternating set of compartments, the anions migrate to the adjacent compartment in one direction only and the cations migrate to the adjacent compartment in the other direction. However, in the other alternating set of compartments, no ions migrate out. Thus the first set of alternating compartments becomes depleted in ions i.e. dissolved salt while the second set of compartments becomes more concentrated in dissolved salt. Water taken from the first set of compartments has been desalinated, therefore. Details of methods used in water desalination are found in The U.S.A.t.D. Desalination Manual, August 1980, sponsored by United States International Development Cooperation Agency, Office of Engineering, and prepared by CH2M Hill International Corporation. A common problem encountered in processes for the desalination of saline water is the formation of scale when hardness ions, such as magnesium g2 and calcium Ca2 , are present and the water has alkalinity caused by the bicarbonate carbonate system HCO Under these conditions, scale e.g.magnesium hydroxide, calcium sulfate and or calcium carbonate precipitates and deposits itself on various surfaces in the desalination apparatus. In evaporative processes, when deposition takes place on surfaces at which heat interchange takes place, e.g. the brine heater chamber and the heat recovery chamber in flash evaporation, this impedes heat transfer and lowers the efficiency of the process In membrane processes, when deposition takes place on the membrane, this partially clogs the membrane and reduces its permeability to desalinated water or ions. One solution to scale production has been to add one or more antiscalants to the water prior to desalination. Cne type of antiscalant wnich has been used is a low molecular weight polymer number average molecular weight 500 to 5,000 derived from an organic, unsaturated, carboxylic acid, for example acrylic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid or methacrylic acid These low molecular weight, poly meric antiscalants are often copolymers, and sometimes they incorporate non carboxylic acid monomers. For example, in evaporative desalination processes, particularly useful antiscalants are methacrylic acid maleic acid copolymers U.S. Patent No. 4,390,670 and the maleic acid acrylamide styrene terpolymers U.S.Patent No 4,0 65,607 . Similarly, in membrane desalination processes, particularly useful antiscalants are acrylic acid homopolymers However, when the saline water being desalinated further contains certain transition metal corrosion ions, such as iron foe3 , copper Cu2 or nickel no2 , these latter ions interfere with the polymeric antiscalants mentioned above and these latter ions reduce the effectiveness of the polymeric antiscalants.Accordingly, this invention provides a solution to the problem of interference of transitional metal corrosion ions with the above mentioned antiscalants It has now been found that certain chelating agents, when added to the saline water which is to be desalinated, prior to or at the same time as the addition of the antiscalant, nullify the effect of the transition metal corrosion ions. A variety of chelating agents can be used, the major requirements for said agents being that. 1 they should be stable over the H range of water supplies normally subjected to water desalination, e.g. from pE 5 to 9 2 they should complex sore strongly with corrosion metal ions foe3 , Cu2 , than with hardness ions Mg2 , Ca2 3 they should be readily soluble in water 4 they should be non volatile 5 they should be stable at moderately elevated. temperatures, e.g they should have a half life greater than five hours at temperatures up to 1100C and 6 they should be compatible with the antiscalant. The following is a list of the types of chelating agents which are useful in the process of this in invention a an aliphatic alpha hydroxy acid selected from the group consisting of citric acid, HOOCC OH CH COOH 2 glucoheptonic acid, HOOC CH OH 5CH2OH gluconic acid, isocitric acid, and tartaric acid, HOOCCR OH CR OH COOH b an aliphatic alpha amino carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of diethanolglycine, ethanoldiglycine, HOCR2CR2 N CH2COOH 2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, acid, HOOCCH2 2NCH2CHzN CR2CH 20H CH2COOH and nitrilotriacetic acid, N CH2COOH 3 c hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid, CH3C OH PO OHl2 2 and d an aminophosphonic acid selected from the group consisting of ethylenediamin,etetra methylenephosphonic acid , CH2N CR2pO OR 21 2 hexamethylenediaminetetra methylenephosphonic acid , CH2CH2CH2N CH2PO OH 2 2 2 and nitrilotris methylenephosphonic acid , N CE2po OH 2 3 However, preferred chelating agents for use in this invention are citric acid, gluconic acid and hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid The amount of chelating agent to be added to the saline water which is to be desalinated must be an amount which is sufficient to chelate substantially all of said corrosion ions i. e. at least enough to reduce the concentration of unchelated transition metal ions to 0.05 ppm or below However, it is preferred that the chelating agent is not added in an amount which is substantially in excess of the amount necessary to chelate substantially all of the transition metals Accordingly, therefore, the amount of chelating agent needed depends on the concentration of the transition metal corrosion ions in the water which is being desalinated and also the stability constant equilibrium constant between the chelating agent and the particular transition. metal ion. As the concentration of the transition metal ion increases, the amount of chelating agent required must be increased.Also,. as the stability constant between the transition metal and the chelating agent decreases, the amount of chelating agent required must be increased. However, when the water to be desalinated contains about 0.5 ppm of transition metal ions, about 1 ppm of chelating agent will be required while, when the water to be desalinated contains about 10 ppm of transition metal ions, about 45 ppm of the chelating agent will be required As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the polymeric antiscalants referred to in this speci fication contain carboxy groups, and therefore they will form base salts Moreover, these antiscalants can be added to saline water to be desalinated in the form of a base salt Particularly useful in this regard are alkali metal salts In like manner, the chelating agents. of this invention will form base salts, and the chelating agents can be used in the process of this invention in the form of said base salts Particularly useful base salts of said chelating agents are alkali metal salts The chelating agent is added to the water to be desalinated before or at the same time as the addition of the antiscalant, but the manner in which it is added is not critical It can be added portionwise, in diluted or undiluted form to a reservoir containing water which is to be desalinated, or it can be metered in on a continuous basis, in diluted or undiluted form to saline water before it enters a desalinator When the chelating agent is to be added in diluted form, it can be added as a solution in water, or, alternatively, it can be compounded into tablets or capsules with a variety of excipients As indicated hereinbefore, the process improvement of the present invention can be used for desalination of a variety of saline water supplies.However, it is particularly suitable for desalination of seawater, both by flash evaporation and reverse osmosis The following examples are being provided solely for the purpose of further illustration EXAMPLE 1 Flash Evaporation The single stage flash evaporator SSFE described by Auerbach and Carruthers Desalination, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 31, 279 288 19793 but with a modified blowdown heat recovery section, was operated as described, using synthetic brine having the following composition Concentration Ingredient g kg of water sodium chloride 40.06 calcium chloride 1.662 magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 10.185 magnesium chloride hexahydrate 7.549 potassium chloride 0.996 potassium bromide 0.144 sodium bicarbonate 0.3750The above seawater to which an antiscalant FLOCON 280, a low molecular weight maleic acid methacrylic acid copolymer, .S.

The amount of scale found is expressed as Percent scale, wherePercent scale EMI12.1 Because the levels of Ca2 and Mg in seawater are typically 400 and 1,300 ppm, respectively, total theoretical scale is limited by the HCO3 level.Also two moles of HCO3 are required to produce one mole ofCaCO3 or Mg OH 2 Hence mmoles theoretical scale L EMI12.2 The results are shown in Table I Table IEMI12.3 tb SEP Percent SEP Scale tb SEP Heat tb Run SEP Concentration SEP Brine SEP Recovery SEP Flash tb No SEP .
