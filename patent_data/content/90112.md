## Abstract
A puzzle that includes pieces or chips arranged in vertical columns on a board. In the desired design when the puzzle is solved, each chip will be in an ordered sequence in its particular column. For example, there can be four columns of five rows of playing cards and each column includes a royal flush in the particular suit when the puzzle is solved. The columns alternate as to suits and color. The pieces of the puzzle are originally scrambled. A pocket is provided for sliding one chip out of playing position so that the remaining tiles can be moved either vertically or hor izontaily one at a time. A tongue and groove arrangement in the chips and board allows the chips to be slid easily without falling out.

## Description
PUZZLEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a puzzle played by moving slidable chips from a scrambled pattern to a predetermined desired pattern. The public has displayed a keen interest in games which require an analytic approach and which chailenge the ability to foresee the results of actions that are taken or moves that are made. The several cube puzzles currently on the market and their popularity indicate the desire on the part of a large number of consumers to engage in this type of challenging activity. t is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved puzzle which is challenging and which is economical to produce. It is another object of the present invention to produce a new and improved puzzle which can be made in compact size and wherein the puzzle is integrated so that the pieces of the puzzle are contained and will not fall out. It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved puzzle which lends itself to various ordered designs.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A puzzle wherein chips are arranged in columns and rows in a scrambled fashion for moving in a horizontal or vertical direction one at a time to accomplish a desired pattern. One of the chips is moved to a reserved pocket so that the other chips may be moved in sliding fashion relative to each other and to the puzzle frame.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a plan view of the puzzle of the present invention with the playing chips out of final order, and making a straight. Figure 2 is a plan view of the puzzle of the present invention with the playing chips arranged in final order, and making a royal flush. Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3 3 ofFigure 1, with the playing chips removed. Figure 4 is a plan view of one of the playing chips. Figure 5 is a front v.iew of.the playing chips shown in Figure 4. Referring to the drawings, a generally rectangular frame is shown at 10. The frame 10 has a rectangular opening in its face resulting in a back board 12. In the embodiment shown, twenty chips 14 are positioned on the back board 12 in the frame 10. in Figure 2, these chips are placed in an ordered sequence in each column to solve the puzzle. The first column has the cards representing a royal flush in spades. The second column has a royal flush in hearts. The third column shows a royal flush in clubs.The fourth column has a royal flush in diamonds. This is the pattern to be accomplished when the puzzle is solved.When the puzzle is first received, the order is scrambled as shown in Figure 1. Each column has an alternating sequence of black and red cards which is scrambled or disordered as shown in Figure 1. The frame 10 includes a ledge 16 extending along one end and a ledge 18 extending along one side of the opening in the face of the frame. A groove 20 extends along the other end and a groove 22 extends along the other side of the frame 10. Each chip 14 includes a ledge 24 extending along one side and a ledge 26 extending along one end.These ledges can be one piece and are rounded at the corner 28. The ledges extend to a point short of the opposite side and end of the chip. The other side of the chip includes side groove 27 and the other end of the chip includes end. groove 29. The chips 14 fit together in sliding engagement, with the ledges of one chip extending into the grooves of the adjacent chip. The grooves and ledges of the chip fit in the frame ledges and grooves.Thus, the chips 14 can be readily slid in a vertical or horizontal direction with respect to each other and with respect to the frame 10. The frame 10 has a pocket 30 therein so that the lower right chip 14 can be moved vertically down and out of playing position. This leaves a blank space where the chip was previously located, and the remaining chips can now be manipulated horizontally or vertically to form the desired arrangement where the columns are in vertical sequence of the same card suit as shown in Figure 2. The last chip is moved into position from the reserve pocket 30 to complete the design, and solve the puzzle. A royal flush has been demonstrated in the drawings, but it will be recognized that a straight flush or any other sequential arrangement can be utilized. Also, any other ordered arrangement of chips can be used. One example is a boX chasing a girl who is chasing a hound, who is chasing a fox, who is chasing a chicken. Each of these figures is represented on a separate chip. There can be alternating colors of red and gray figures for example in the columns, or each column of chips can be a different color. The chips are scrambled when the puzzle is received and the player must arrange the columns in proper sequence. This puzzle is challenging and time consuming to solve. The chips cannot fall out of the frame because of the tongue and groove arrangement and yet they are easy to slide. The pieces of the puzzle are simple and inexpensive to manufacture. Various sequential, ordered designs can be provided to make the puzzle interesting.
