# Double post reentrant cavity for NMR probes.

## Abstract
A sample cavity resonator for NMR spectroscopy con tains a pair of diametrically opposed paraxial post structures 55, 55 approximating a single turn inductance about the axially positioned sample. The posts are separately excited in 180 degree relative phases by respective coupling loops 76, 76 spaced between the corresponding post and the cavity wall. A slideable piston structure 60 capacitively couples to the posts and provides cavity tuning.
