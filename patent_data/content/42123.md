# Electronic motor braking system.

## Abstract
The motor braking system for use with an alternating current motor and an AC power source includes a power circuit for supplying a DC braking current to the motor. A capacitor which as charged during motor operation, dis charges when the motor is turned off and thus provides a pulse of energizing current to a contactor which quickly connects the power circuit to the motor and starts the electric braking cycle as soon as the AC source is discon nected from the motor. A timing circuit is also started and maintains the the energizing current for a predetermined amount of time while the motor is coming to a stop. A mechanical brake may also be used to complete the stop ping sequence if desired, with the mechanical brake being engaged when the braking current is terminated.
