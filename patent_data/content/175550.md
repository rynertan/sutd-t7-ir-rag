# Sheet heaters having dissociated insulation.

## Abstract
Electrical sheet heaters which comprise electrodes 12, 13 secured to a surface of a resistive element 11 and whose insulation comprises a laminar insulating element 18 adjacent to, but not secured to, the electrodes and resistive element. Such an insulating element permits relative movement of the insulation and the electrodes, e.g. as a result of flexing or of different expansions on thermal cycling, and thus reduces the danger that the electrodes will become detached from the re sistive element.

## Description
DESCRIPTION SHEET HEATERS HAVING DISSOCIATED INSULATION This invention relates to sheet heaters. Sheet heaters of many kinds are known. They often comprise a laminar heating element which comprises a laminar resistive element and two or more electrodes which can be connected to a suitable power source, and an insulating jacket which is firmly secured to the heating element. The resistive element may be composed of a conductive polymer, i.e. a mixture of a conductive filler and an organic polymer this term being used to include polysiloxanes , the filler being dispersed in, or otherwise held together by, the organic polymer, and may exhibit PTC behavior, thus rendering the heater self regulating. In some sheet heaters, the electrodes are positioned on one face of the resistive element, e.g. by printing a conductive ink onto the heating element.

We have discovered that when the electrodes of a sheet heater are positioned on a face of the resistive element, serious difficulties can arise if the insulating element on that side of the heater is secured firmly thereto in the known ways, e.g. through the use of an adhesive or a melt bond. Thus we have found that if the electrodes are secured to the insulating layer and to the resistive element, the bond to the insulating element can cause the electrode to become detached from the resistive element, resulting in loss of power and or dangerous short circuits. Such detachment can occur, for example, as a result of flexing the heater if it is flexible and or as a result of thermal cycling which causes different parts of the heater to expand and contract at different rates.The present invention provides improved sheet heaters which mitigate or overcome these difficulties by using an insulating layer which is adjacent to the electrodes and the surface of the resistive element bearing the electrodes, but which is not secured to the electrodes and preferably is not secured to the electrodes or to the resistive element. An added benefit of such heaters is that the separation between the resistive element and the insulation provides a thermal barrier such that heat can be directed towards the substrate to be heated, which is preferably placed on the opposite side from the electrodes. Insulation of the heating element is normally completed by a second insulating layer which is adjacent the surface of the resistive element which does not bear the electrodes. Accordingly, in its first aspect the invention provides an electrical sheet heater which comprises 1 a laminar heating element which comprises a a laminar resistive element having a first face and a second face, and b at least two electrodes which are positioned on the first face of the resistive element and which can be connected to a source of electrical power to cause current to pass through the resistive element and cause resistive heating thereof, and 2 a first laminar insulating element which is adjacent to the electrodes and the first face of the resistive element but is not secured to the electrodes. In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of heating a substrate by placing a heater of the invention adjacent the substrate and passing current through the heater. Insulation of the heater is preferably completed by means of a second laminar insulating element which is secured to the second face of the resistive element preferably by means of a substantially continuous layer of adhesive and to the edge portions of the first insulating element, e.g. by means of an adhesive or a melt bond The insulating elements are preferably flexible polymeric sheets having a melting point substantially above the operating temperature of the heater. When using a heater comprising such insulating elements, the second element is preferably placed adjacent the substrate to be heated, since the adhesive layer assists heat transfer, whereas the separation of the first element from the heating element results in a relative thermal barrier.The first insulating layer preferably covers the electrodes and the first face of the resistive element, but is not secured directly thereto. The heaters of the invention are preferably flexible, by which is meant that at 230C, and preferably at 200C, they can be wrapped around a 18 cm 4 inch diameter mandrel, preferably around a 2.5 cm 1 inch diameter mandrel, without damage. The laminar resistive element of the present invention can be a layer of any resistive material, either PTC or ZTC, but is preferably composed of a conductive polymer. The conductive polymer is preferably melt shaped, particularly melt extruded, in which case the resistive element will usually be at least 0.0051 cm 0.002 inch thick, preferably 0.025 to 0.635 cm 0.01 to 0.25 inch thick, particularly 0.025 to 0.25 cm 0.01 to 0.1 inch thick. However, the conductive polymer can also be shaped as a composition containing a solvent or liquid dispersing medium which is subsequently evaporated. The invention is particularly useful when the electrodes are placed on the resistive element by a process which results in a bond which is vulnerable to damage by flexing or thermal cycling. The electrodes can for example be formed by printing, particularly silk screen printing, a conductive ink onto the resistive element, or by the use of polymer thick film technology, or by sputtering, or by a process comprising an etching step. The electrodes are preferably arranged in a way similar to that disclosed in European PatentApplication No. 85300415.8 corresponding to U.S. SerialNo. 573,099 MP0897 Batliwalla et al , i.e. a plurality of ribbon shaped electrodes which are dimensioned and positioned on a surface of the resistive heating element so that a when current passes between the electrodes, a substantial proportion of the current is parallel to the faces of the resistive element, and b the ratio of the average width of the electrodes, measured parallel to the faces of the resistive element, to the average distance between adjacent electrodes between which current passes, measured parallel to the faces of the resistive element, is at least 0.01 1, particularly at least 0.1 1.Preferably the electrodes are so positioned and dimensioned that, at all points, the distance between adjacent electrodes between which current passes, measured parallel to the faces of the resistive element, is not more than three times the average distance between adjacent electrodes between which current passes, measured parallel to the faces of the resistive element. It is particularly preferred that the ratio of the average width of the electrodes to the average distance between the electrodes between which current passes is from 0.4 1 to 5 1, especially an arrangement in which the electrodes comprise a plurality of parallel bars which are preferably spaced apart from each other by substantially the same distance. When the conductive polymer has been melt extruded, the electrodes are preferably arranged so that the current flows along the direction of extrusion. When the heater requires a ground plane, e.g. if it is to be used in hazardous location, it preferably includes a laminar metallic element which functions as a ground plane, and which is preferably positioned adjacent the face of the first laminar insulating element remote from the resistive element, and or adjacent the face of the second insulating element remote from the resistive element. The ground plane can be of a known kind, but is preferably arranged so as to permit relative movement between the ground plane and the adjacent insulating jacket. When the heater comprises a plurality of electrodes which are positioned on a surface of the resistive element and connected by bus bars, the bus bars are preferably in the form of laminar members as disclosed in the the Application filed contemporaneously herewith our Ref. MP0961 , corresponding to U.S. Serial Nos.650,920, 663,014 and 735,408, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The bus bars can be, but preferably are not, secured to the first insulating element, and when the bus bars are folded around the edge of the heating element, as disclosed in said application, can be, but preferably are not, secured to the second insulating element. The electrodes are preferably formed by printing a conductive PTF ink onto the resistive element in the desired electrode pattern. Preferably a resistive PTF ink having a resistivity intermediate that of the electrodes and the substrate is positioned between the electrodes and the resistive element to improve the physical and electrical contact therebetween. Such an arrangement is described in the the Application filed contemporaneously herewith our Ref. MP0961 , corresponding to U.S.Serial Nos. 650,920, 663,014 and 735,408, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
