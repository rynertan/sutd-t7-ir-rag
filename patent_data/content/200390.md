## Description
This invention relates to the ablation of atherosclerotic plaque in a patient. Ablation of atherosclerotic plaque has previously been attempted in patients using a variety of lasers, e.g. argon lasers, at various wavelengths, e.g. 514 nm for argon lasers . The technique typically involves the use of a flexible optical fibre associated with the laser, as described, e.g. in Choy U.S. Pat. No. 4,207,874. In such known techniques, the plaque is first visualized, either by angiography or using a coherent fibre optic bundle built into the laser catheter, and the ablating laser is then aimed and fired at the plaque. There have been some attempts to improve selectivity in the absorption of laser light by plaques, compared to surrounding tissues, by selectively staining the plaque with, e.g. hematoporphyrin Spears et al 1983 J. Clin Invest. GB A 2125986 discloses a device for the treatment of cancers comprising a pulsed laser beam source, an image detecting means and an endoscope which is arranged to transmit the pulsed laser beam from the pulsed laser beam source and to direct the beam onto a cancer focus to sterilize the cancerous cells. The endoscope also serves to transmit light from the cancer focus and the surface of the affected organism to the image detecting means to enable diagnosis and observation of the cancer focus to be made. EP A 0194856 discloses an apparatus and method for irradiating a treatment area within a body. The method includes introducing elongated flexible radiation transfer conduit fiberoptic arrays into the body cavity with the distal end thereof operatively opposite the treatment area. At the other end of the conduit a particular optical characteristic of the treatment area such as fluorescence is photoelectrically sensed and as long as the particular optical characteristic is sensed there is periodically transmitted laser pulses via the conduit to the treatment site. In a first aspect of this invention, we provide, in combination a carotenoid to be selectively taken up by atherosclerotic plaque in a patient, and a laser apparatus which provides pulsed laser light with a wavelength at which the ratio of Kubelka Munk absorption coefficients of said plaque substance to normal aortic endothelium is at least 1.5 1, and preferably at least 2 1, with a pulse duration less than the thermal relaxation time of the volume of the tissue defined by the diameter of the laser beam within the tissue and the depth at which 67 of the incident light of said laser has been absorbed, and at a beam intensity sufficiently high to cause heating of the target plaque, at the said wavelength and with the said pulse duration, to a temperature effective to burn away a substantial portion of said plaque but not to cause unacceptable damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In a second and alternative aspect of this invention, we provide, in combination a supply of a foodstuff containing a carotenoid to be selectively taken up, upon ingestion by a patient, by atherosclerotic plaque in said patient, and a laser apparatus which provides pulsed laser light with a wavelength at which the ratio of Kubelka Munk absorption coefficients of said plaque to normal aortic endothelium is at least 1.5 1, and preferably at least 2 1, with a pulse duration less than the thermal relaxation time of the volume of the tissue defined by the diameter of the laser beam within the tissue and the depth at which 67 of the incident light of said laser has been absorbed, and at a beam intensity sufficiently high to cause heating of the target plaque, at the said wavelength and with the said pulse duration, to a temperature effective to burn away a substantial portion of said plaque but not to cause unacceptable damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In preferred arrangements, the carotenoid is administered orally or intravenously the administered carotenoid is β carotene the wavelength of the laser light as 440 480 nm, more preferably about 460 nm and administration of β carotene is oral and is carried out at least once daily for at least two days, and more preferably at least one week, prior the exposure to the laser light, at a dosage of between 100 mg and 5,000 mg per day, and preferably at least 300 mg per day. In a third and further alternative aspect of the invention, we provide use of a carotenoid for the manufacture of a medicament for administration to a patient in treatment to ablate atherosclerotic plaque in which treatment, following such administration, the plaque is exposed to pulsed laser light having a wavelength at which the ratio of Kubelka Munk absorption coefficients of said plaque to normal aortic endothelium is at least 1.5 1, and preferably at least 2 1, a pulse duration less than the thermal relaxation time of the volume of the tissue defined by the diameter of the laser beam within the tissue and the depth at which 67 of the incident light of said laser has been absorbed, and at a beam intensity sufficiently high to cause heating of the target plaque at the said wavelength and with the said pulse duration, to a temperature effective to burn away a substantial portion of said plaque but not to cause unacceptable damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In preferred arrangements the carotenoid is β carotene. A foodstuff containing the carotenoid may be used. The invention is hereinafter more particularly described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawings will first be described. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of apparatus used to determine the wavelength of tissue absorption. Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic representation of a laser and associated apparatus used to demonstrate selective plaque ablation according to the invention. Fig. 3 is a graph showing ratios of absorption coefficients for normal human aortic endothelium and aortic plaque over a range of wavelengths. The first step in the plaque ablation method described is to select a wavelength at which the plaque normal aorta Kubelka Munk absorption coefficent is at least 1.5 1. This difference in absorption coefficients seen at about 460 nm in patients not administered supplemental chromophore results from the preferential accumulation in plaque of dietary carotenoids. Where a chromophore is administered to the patient prior to ablation, the wavelength employed will reflect the concommitant change in the composition of the plaque. For example, administration of a chromophore, e.g., capsanthin, which absorbs at a wavelength above 460 nm will bring about some increase in the optimal wavelength. However, because carotenoids are already present in the plaque, the administration of a chromophore absorbing above or below the pre administration optimum will generally result in an optimal wavelength somewhere between the absorption maximum of the administered chromophore, and the pre administration optimum. The absorption maxima of ten suitable carotenoids known to exist in humans and, in some instances, in foods, are given in the table below. The Kubelka Munk absorbance coefficients of plaque and normal aortic tissue are measured by conventional techniques, as is explained in more detail below. The amount, duration, and mode of administration of the chromophore will depend on its properties, e.g., toxicity and affinity for plaque. Some carotenoids are naturally present in high concentrations in foods such as carrots and tomatoes, and administration of these could be achieved at least in part by daily ingestion of such foods. The chromophore can also be administered, orally, admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance, in a pill or liquid, or can be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally. It is particularly useful to employ a chromophore which, in addition to being preferentially accumulated in plaque, fluoresces, facilitating detection and laser aiming. Carotenoids, for example, advantageously fluoresces when excited at 460 nm. As mentioned above, the pulse duration used is related to the thermal relaxation time t of the volume of tissue defined by the diameter of the laser beam within the tissue and the depth at which 67 of the incident light of the laser has been absorbed the relaxation time is the time it takes for the temperature increase Δ T caused by a pulse of light of a duration approaching zero to decrease by one half at the surface of that tissue volume after the pulse has ceased. Thermal relaxation time t is roughly approximated by where d, expressed in cm, is the smaller of the diameter of the irradiated volume conventionally referred to as D and the depth at which 67 of the incident light has been absorbed conventionally referred to as d . K is the thermal difussivity, in cm² sec. K is approximately 0.0013, for water. It should be emphasized that this method of calculating t is given for convenience only where reference is made herein to the relationship between pulse duration and t, The fluence Joules cm² of the laser light should be sufficiently high to cause heating of the target plaque, at the wavelength and pulse duration employed, to a temperature at which a substantial portion of the plaque is burned away, and not so high as to cause unacceptable damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The requisite fluence range varies with the diameter of the optical fiber used in conjunction with the laser. Generally, a fluence of 2 10J cm² is preferred for a 1 mm diameter optical fibre, while smaller diameter fibres will require higher fluences to compensate for scattering losses at the periphery of the illustrated volume. For fluorescence detection, a lower, non burning intensity, e.g., about 1 milliwatt, is used in a pulsing or continuous mode to excite fluorescence. Any laser which can deliver pulses of the desired intensity, duration, and wavelength can be used. A preferred laser is a flashlamp pumped pulse dye laser. The fibre optic bundles and auxiliary apparatus by which laser light is delivered to the plaques can be of any conventional configuration, e.g., as described in Choy, A particular plaque ablation procedure was carried out as follows. Absorbance coefficients were determined by measuring remittance and transmittance of normal aortic endothelium and aortic plaque, essentially by the integrating sphere technique described in Anderson et al. 1979 Proc. Symp. Bioengineer and the Skin, Cardiff, Wales MTP Press, London . The procedure was carried out using the apparatus shown in Fig. 1, including 7.5 cm diameter barium sulphate coated integrating sphere 10, connected by 2 mm diameter quartz fibre optic bundles 12 to Beckman 5270 double beam spectrophotometer 14, which is interfaced with Hewlett Packard 9825A computer 16 for digital data acquisition and analysis. Freshly coated barium sulphate plates not shown were used as 100 remittance standards. The apparatus further included collimating lens 18, for providing a collimating light beam to illuminate a 5 mm diameter region of the tissue quartz sample holding plates 20 and 21 photomultiplier tube 22 beam source 24 fibre optic bundle 26, connecting beam source 24 with spectrophotometer 14 and lead sulphide cell 26. To use the apparatus of Fig. 1 to determine absorption coefficients, cadaveric specimens of human aorta were obtained less than 48 hours The tissue quartz plate sandwiches were placed on the integrating sphere apparatus of Fig. 1 remittance and transmittance measured as in Anderson et al., The results are given in Fig. 3, expressed as the plaque to normal ratio. As shown in Fig. 3, the ratio is highest between 440 and 480 nm, with a peak at 460 nm. Ablation of aortic plaques of cadavers was carried out using the apparatus of claim 2, including Candella SLL 500 Coaxial Flashlamp pumped dye laser 10, translating tissue mount 12, and a 40 output coupler not shown . The laser generated 1 microsecond pulses with energies up to 2 joules at 459 to 470 nm with coumarin 445 laser dye Exciton C445 , 1.5 x 10 ⁴ molar in 50 methanol and 50 distilled water. Laser wavelength output was measured with a high intensity monochrometer Bausch Lomb 33 86 76 and the pulse width characterized with an ultrafast silicon photodiode EG G FND 100Q reverse biased by 90 volts. The laser mirrors were adjusted until output burn patterns on polaroid film were circular. The 1 cm diameter light beam coming out of the laser was focused with a 20 cm focal length quartz lens to form a 2 3 mm diameter spot on the specimen. The specimen could then be translated across the laser beam to give an identical radiation dose to several normal and atheromatous regions of cadaver aorta, obtained as before. Specimens were irradiated, photographed fresh, fixed in formalin, bisected through the rows of irradiation sites, and photographed in cross section. At 400 mJ per pulse, 20 pulses formed an obvious crater in plaque but caused only slight browning in, and no removal of, adjacent normal tissue. Plaque required 3.2 7.9 J cm2 for removal and normal aortic tissue required 9.7 20.5 J cm2. In general the yellower and softer atheromas had the lowest thresholds while hard and or pale atheromas had higher threshold fluences.
