# Method of making cast iron engine blocks and the like.

## Abstract
A method for making grey iron castings having as a cardi nal feature that the molten grey iron, after being made and prior to being poured into the molds, is maintained for a period of from one to one half to two and one half hours, preferably about two hours, at a substantially constant temperature. The resulting greatly increased homogeneity and temperature uni formity of the molten metal throughout its mass greatly im proves the quality and quality control of the castings made.
