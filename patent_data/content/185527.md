# METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MIXING LIQUID WITH VISCOUS MATERIAL

## Abstract
The invention relates to rotary processors and methods for mixing low viscosity liquid with viscous material while controlling plugging of the means for introducing the low viscosity liquid. A mixing rotary processor 10 comprises at least one annular channel 18 on a rotor 12 enclosed by a housing 16 for form a mixing passage 28 into which a viscous material is introduced and dragged forward by the rotating channel walls 20 from an inlet 34 past a spreader 42 as films on the channel walls, forming a void down stream of the spreader 42 between the films. Low viscosity liquid is sprayed by spray means 44 within the void on to and carried downstream with the films to be mixed with material collected at a passage end wall 38 . Conveniently spraying is into a saturated vapor zone in the void where liquid vaporizes and condenses onto the films as well distributed fine droplets. Removal of impurities which are devolatilised only with difficulty is facilitated.
