# A semiconductor laser apparatus.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser apparatus has a semiconductor laser chip 10 with a first light emitting facet 25 and a second light emitting facet containing an interference effect creating means therein for creating an interference effect within the resonator s thereof, a laser light reflecting means 23 for returning a part of the laser light emitted from the first light emitting facet 25 of said semiconductor laser chip 10 to the first light emitting facet 25 , and a mounting base 21 on which said semiconductor laser chip 10 and said laser light reflecting means 23 are fixed in a parallel manner.
