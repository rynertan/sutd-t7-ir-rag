# Human monoclonal antibodies to serotypic lipopolysaccharide determinants on gram negative bacteria and their production.

## Abstract
Transformed human lymphocyte cell lines have been produced which secrete human monoclonal antibodies to serotypic determinants on LPS molecules of gram negative bacteria. These antibodies have been found to be protective against lethal challenges of the homologous bacteria. Phar maceutical compositions containing these antibodies and their prophylactic and therapeutic use in the management of gram negative disease in humans are also disclosed. Humam lymphocyte cell lines secreting human monoc lonal antibodies specifically reacting with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fisher immunotypes 1 C5B7 , 2 6F11 , 4 C5D5 , 5 13C1 , 6 5G2 and 7 8E7 were deposited at the American Type Culture Collection and given A.T.C.C. Accession Nos. CRL 8753, CRL 8562, CRL 8754, CRL 8796, CRL 8797 and CRL 8795, respectively.
