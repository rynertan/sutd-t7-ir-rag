# Heat recovery from a tar laden gas.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for recovering heat from a hot product gas produced in a coal gasification plant where the gas is laden with vaporized hydrocarbonaceous foulants and particulate matter. The process recovers heat from a flow of raw gas laden with particulates and vaporized tars including low, intermediate and high boiling point tars. A cooling liquid consisting mainly of a condensate of the intermediate boiling point tars is sprayed by nozzle 30 into the gas flow in chamber 16. The initial temperature of the spray is greater than the temperature at which the low boiling point tars condense. As the spray cools the gas, the intermediate and high boiling point tars condense and capture the particulates within the condensate. The condensate is passed to a settling tank 33 and the gas is passed to a heat exchanger 24 for conventional heat recovery. Within the settling tank the condensate of the intermediate boiling point tars separates from the mixture and is passed to a heat exchanger 41 for indirectly heating water to steam and the condensate is cooled to a temperature greater than the temperature at which the low boiling point tars condense and is recirculated via 53 to be sprayed into a flow of raw gas. The process increases gasifier efficiency by recovery of the heat from the feed end gas without disruptive deposits of tars on heat recovery equipment.
