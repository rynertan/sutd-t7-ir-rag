## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a furan derivative. The furan derivative of formula I EMI1.1 which is known as r√†nitidine is disclosed in British PatentSpecification No 1565966 as a potent and selective H2 antagonist. T.he present invention provides a process for the preparation of ranitidine of formula I which comprises reacting a compound of formula II EMI1.2 in which L is a leaving group, with nitromethane at an elevated temperature, for example 80 1100C. Examples of leaving groups L are groups of the formula SR where R is a straight or branched C16 alkyl group optionally substituted by phenyl e.g. methyl, butyl or benzyl Thus for example, an isothiourea of formula II in which L is the group SR e.g. methylthio may be heated with nitromethane at about 100 C. Optionally the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile, N methylpyrrolidone, a ketone e.g.methyl isobutyl ketone ,an alkanol e.g. isopropanol or t butanol or a hydrocarbon e.g. toluene . A base, such as an inorganic base e.g. potassium carbonate or an amino e.g triethylamine , may optionally be present. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert atmosphere, for example under nitrogen. The present invention has the advantage over prev. ously described methods for the preparation of i anitidine that the evolution of thiol is significantly reduced or even eliminated. Since it is necessary to prevent the release of such thiols into the environment and this requires the use of specialised equipment which is expensive to run, a process which reduces the amount of thiol evolved offers a significant advantage. The isothiourea of formula II in which L is the group SR may be prepared from a salt of the thiourea II1 EMI2.1 for example, a hydrochloride salt, by alkylation with an appropriate alkylating agent, such as an alkyl or aralkyl halide e.g. an alkyl iodide such as methyl iodide . The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as an alkanol e.g. methanol , and pieferably with heating, for example at the reflux temperature of the solvent. If desired the isothiourea of formula II may be isolated in the form of an acid addition salt, for example as an oxalate. The isothiourea of formula II and the thiourea III can exhibit tautomerism, and the formulae are intenced to cover all tautomers. If desired the furan derivative of formula tIj once obtained may be converted into an acid addition salt, e.g.a hydrochloride, using conventional methods. Thus, for example appropriate quantities of the free base of formula I and an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, may be mixed in a suitable solvent s , e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol, or an ester such as ethyl acetate.
