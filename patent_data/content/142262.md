# Wound care and drainage system.

## Abstract
Pouch type wound care and drainage system wherein the pouch includes a bottom wall secured to an adhesive layer which can be cut to fit around the wound or surgical opening, gusseted side walls, and a top wall provided with one or more access openings. Means are provided for securing an irriga tion port and a catheter access port to these top wall openings. The bottom wall extends beyond the adhesive layer and is provided with a large exit port oriented in such a manner that gravity will drain wound exudate from the pouch. This exit port is also large enough to accommodate the average size hand to aid in locating the pouch on the body and permit access to the wound site without removing the pouch from the body.
