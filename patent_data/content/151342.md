# Process and apparatus for the purification of contaminated liquids by filtration.

## Abstract
Contaminated liquid is passed through a resilient, lumpy porous or cellular filtering medium 17 anti gravitationally and under pressure the porosity of the filtering medium 17 is controlled by the pressure of the contaminated liquid. In the course nf regeneration of the filtering medium 17 , simultaneously and continuously contaminated liquid and compressed air are passed upwardly through filtering medium 17 , the air pressure being approximately equal to that of the contaminated liquid. In this way, contaminants accumulated in the filtering medium 17 are removed by means of the compressed air and the throughflowing contaminated liquid. The apparatus includes a closed filter tank 13 , perforated sheets 14, 15, 16 arranged perpendicularly to the direction of flow of the contaminated liquid in the closed filter tank 13 and containing therebetween a resilient, lumpy, porous or cellular filtering medium 17 . At the bottom of the filter tank 13 there is an inlet 4a for contaminated liquid and an inlet 7a for compressed air. At the top of the filter tank 13 there is an outlet which is bifurcated to provide a discharge 6a for filtered liquid and one 5a for pre filtrate which may be recycled to the inlet 4a .

## Description
PROCESS AND APPARATUS rOR THE PURIFICATION OF CONTAMINATED LIQUIDS BY FILTRATION. Uhe invention relates to a process and enequipment for the purification of contaminated liquids by filtrating. Traditional sand filter beds used for filtrating liquids are well known with which filtration is taking place from the top downwards, whils re wasbing is performed anti gravitationally. Speed of filtration is relatively low. The Hungerian patent HU PS 279 030 described a method, in courts of which after having finished anti grsvitstionel filtration the Uquid left in the filtertank is pressed by compressed air allowed to stream from the top downwards in a short time, wherety the resilient filtering medium is also pressed, thereafter filtered conteminations are removed from the filtering medium, The advantage of said process lies in that liquids can be removed in a short time, while the drawback lies in that the filter tank is to be filled repeatedly with the liquid to be filtered.Regeneration, filling, as well as removal of pre filtrate require about 10 of filtering period of supplying clean water . The essence of the French patent FR PS 2 224 412 relating to the so called HYDRONAUTICS equipment lies in that in the filter tank the filtering medium is surrounded by e stationary perforated sheet and one to be noted by means of a piston, If the filtering mediuin becomes blocked up, the two perforated sheets are approached to each other by the aid of the piston, whereby the filtered contaminsted materials are pressed out from the resilient filtering medium. The drawback of this process lies in that regeneration, willing and removal of pre filtrate are most timeoonsuming. The essence of the solution according to the l PS 3 424 674 lies in that the liquid to be filtered is allowed to stream anti gravitationally through the filter medium in a filter tank which is filled with beads made of e synthetic material, preferably polyethylene with a specific weight being considerably less, than that of the liquid to be filtered, whereas the filtered liquid and the contaminated filtering medium are separated and the liquid is discharged on the top of the filter tank. imbile streaming, the iltering medium thus is continuously cleaned by agitating and scrubbing, whereafter it is led back continuously into the filter tank. The advantage of the process lies in that filtering medium is continuously cleaned, while the disadvantageous feature is that the process can be realized in an open tank only, in e closed pressurized system it cannot be used. in this case, however, speed of filtrating is very low. The aim of the invention is to develop a process and an equipment for filtering comtaminated liquids, with which time needed for regeneration is minimal, at the seme time filtering and regeneration are unidirectional, The invention is based on the recognition that the transit speed of the air bubbles is considerably higher, than the transit speed of liquids. In such a manner efficient and quick regeneration can be achieved, unidirectionally with filtration. Compressed air is introduced in the saze direction as the liquid. In accordance with the aim set the process according to the invention for the purification of contaminated liquids by filtering is perfonned so, that the contaminated liquid is led through the resilient lumpy porous filtering medium from the bottom upwards under pressure, while by the pressure of the contaminated liquid porosity of the filtering medium is controlled for the sake of regeneration beside continuously supplying the contaminated liquid the filtering medium is pressed by compressed air the pressure of which is nearly equal to the pressure of the contaminated liquid and shich is allowed to pass from the bott upwards and by means of the compressed air as well as the flowing contaminated liquid vontsminations having been accumulated in the filtering medium are washed thersfrom. In accordance with tbe aim set the equipment according to the invention for the purification of conta i nated liquids by filtering is formed so, that it contains a closed filtertenk, two or more perforated sheets which are arranged perpendicularly to the flaw direction of the contawineted liquid in said closed filter tank, furtheron between said perforated sheets there is the resilient porous filtering medium on the bottom of the filter tank there is an inlet stud for introducing the contaiinated liquid the equipnent also contains an inlet stud for the compressed air and a stud on the upper part of the filter tank for the discharge of the filtered liquid and the pre filtrate, respectively. A further characteristic of the invention lies in that grain size of the filtering medium lies in the range between 25 to 50 mm, preferably 25 to 30 inin, porosity equals to 40 to 50 pores cm, bulk deneity to 30 to 35 kgfm3, it is made of a synthetic material, preferably of polyurethane foam. With a further preferred embodiment the filtertank is of cylindrical shape, the filter tank is connected to a manometer and vie a pipeline for the compressed air it is connected to an air compressor. On the part of the pipeline lying at the filter tank nozzles distributing the compressed air are to be found. The pipeline delivering compressed air is provided with a closing organ e.g. a magnetic valve, closing the stream of compressed air, as well as with a pressure regulsting closing organ, e.g. a ball pivot.Prom the El ud discharging the filtered liquid and the prefiltrate two pipelines are forked, one for the pre filtrate and one for the filtered water, The pipeline for the pre filtrate is provided with a closing organ, closing the flow of the pre filtrate, while the other one has P closing organ for closing the flow of the filtered liquid.The pipeline delivering the pre filtrate is connected to a liquid storage tank, which again is connected wit the filtertank via the the pipeline delivering the contaminated liquid, said pipeline is provided with a closing organ, e. g. e magnetic valve which is closing the flow of the contewineted liquid. From the pipeline for the contaminated liquid an output controlling line is branched off to the liquid storage tank. In the line there is a closing organ regulating the output, as e.g. a ball pivot and an organ for regulating the output, e.g. a magnetic valve etthe end of the pipeline for the contaminated liquid, in the liquid storage tank there is a feeding pump arranged. The solution according to the invention has several advantages. It is considered as a considerable advantage, in so far as time for regeneration and gaining the pre filtrate are short. Regeneration does not require clean weter, the filter tank has not be to be discharged for regeneration and filled thereafter, in addition, e most efficient regeneration can be achieved. Due to the shorter regeneration and pre filtrate gaining period, invenstment costs are lower, as effective output in considerably higher. There is no discharge und charge, accordingly useful capecity can be further increased. The equipment is simple. The invention will be described by means of a preferred embodiment serving as an example, by the aid of the drawing enclosed, showing the schematioal errangemert of the equip mend. Dne contaminated liquid 1 errives into tne liquid storage tank 2, wherefrom it is delivered through the pipeline 20, the inlet stud 4a and the closing organ 4 clos the low of the contarinated liquid to the bottom of the iltertank 13. Optionally e flocculatino agent can be admixed to the contemineted liquid 1 in the liquid storage tank 2.the line 21 regulating the output is branched off from the pipeline 20 delivering the contaminated liquid the pipeline 21 is leading back a part of the contaminated liquid optionally mized with a flocculating egent through the output regulating closing organ 10, e.g. a ball pivot and the output controlling organ, e.g. a magnetic valve to the liquid storage tank 2. In the closed filter tank 13 three perforated sheets are arranged perpendicularly to the direction of strea, namely the lower perforated sheet 16, the central perforated sheet 15 and the upper perforated sheet 14. Between the perforated sheets 14, 15, 16 there is a lumpy resilient porous filtering medium 17. A part of the filtering medium is pressed to the upper perforated sheet 14, while the other part is pressed to the central perforated sheet 15, when filtration in anti gravitational direction is teking place. On the upper part 13e of the filter tak 13 the diackerge studs 5a, 6a are to be found. The discherge stud Be, 6a are forked, one branch is for the pre iltrete, this is the pipeline 22, on which there is P pre filtrate closing orge 5, e.g. a magnetic valve, the other branch, the pipeline 23 for the filtered liquid contains the closing organ 6 for the filtered liquid. he pipeline 22 delivers the pre filtrate into the liquid storage tank 2, while the pipeline 23 deliver the filkered liquid either to the storage tank or to the place of application. In case of regeneration compressed air is led from the air compressor 8 through the compressed air delivering pipeline 19, the pressure regulating closing organ 12, e.g. a ball pivot, the closing organ 7 closing the flow of compressed air , e.g. a magnetic valve, to the filter tank 13. On the bottom of the filter tank 13 compressed air is evenly distributed by the nozzles 9. The entigravitationally streaming compressed air is passing through the pores of the filtering medium 17 in course of regeneration and forces out the contaminations. Prior to filtrating the closing organ 4 closing the stream of contaminated liquid is open, the pre filtrate closing organ 5. The organ 6 closing the path of the filtered liquid, es well as the organ 7 closing the stream of compressed air are closed. Thereafter the ploeing organ 5 is closed and the closing organ 4 for the filtered liquid i8 opened. flow filtering is taking place. In course of regeneration the organ 6 closing the flow of the filtered liquid is closed, the closing organ 5 for the pre filtrate and the compressed air closing organ 7 are open. On the filter tank 13 there is manometer for pressure control. The process and equipment according to the invention serve in particular for sewage pufirication, but other liquids can be cleaned too. Filtered water can be used as drink water, industrial water or filtered sewage etc.
