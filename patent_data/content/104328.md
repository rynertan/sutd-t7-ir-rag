# Cathodoluminescent red emitting superlinear phosphor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a red emitting superlinear phosphor ZnSe Cu,Al,Co which is suitable for use in a current sensitive, single gun color CRT screen. By the addition of a small amount of Co, a red emitting linear phosphor Zn Cu,Al is altered to exhibit superlinear characteristics while maintain ing its red emitting spectrum characteristics. The superlinear phosphor may be mixed with a green emitting sublinear phosphor such as Zn₂SiO₄ Mn to form a CRT screen. The resultant screen displays a wider color shift from green to red with the increase of beam current density and also minimizes the brightness variation perception due to the change of current density and thus color.
