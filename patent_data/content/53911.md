# Forced draft radiant wall fuel burner.

## Abstract
A forced draft radiant wall fuel burner, comprises a burner constructed with a central circular pipe 12 for the conduction of pressurised combustion air 44 , a second larger diameter pipe 14 coaxial with the air pipe 12 , with pressurised gas supplied to the closed annular space 50 between the pipes. The inner pipe 12 extends forwardly beyond the end of the outer pipe 14 . Fuel orifices 66 are drilled in the forward and 18 of the annular space 50 . A second series of gas orifices 68 are drilled through the outer wall of the second tube 14 . A plurality of air orifices 58 are drilled radially in the forward end of the air pipe 12 . The air tube 12 spreads conically outwardly at its forward end 52 . There are a plurality of longitudinal slots 54 , for radial flow of air 62 outwardly against a cylindrical wall 24 which is part of a circular plate 22 over the forward end of the air pipe. The two flows of air provide turbulent and complete mixing with the gas.
