# Double ended hollow fiber permeator.

## Abstract
A permeate which is extracted from both ends of a hollow fiber bundle 10 and discharged at one end only of a permea tor. A fluid feedstock such as salt water is introduced under pressure through the first port 20 . It flows through adaptor dual passage connector 32 and the perforations in first tube 62 and radially through the bundle 10 . The permeate fresh water enters hollow fibers 12 by reverse osmosis and flows through the open ends of the fibers to porous blocks 42, 48 . The permeate from block 42 flows through adaptor 32 , imperforate tube 64 and bushing 54 to the third port 24 . The permeate from block 48 flows directly to port 24 . The rejected brine flows through screen 60 and the open spaces between shroud 36 and shell 14 to the second port 22 .
