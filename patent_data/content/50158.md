# METHOD OF MAKING A DAM FOR A COMMUNICATION CABLE.

## Abstract
A method of making a dam including the steps of forming bared portions of cable conductors 4 of a communication cable 1 by stripping the sheath 3 , covering them with a mold 5 , injecting a self curing resin 2 it into the mold 5 , and curing it. In this method, a resin which foams as it cures is used as the self curing resin 2 , the resin 2 foams in the mold after being injected thereinto in an un foamed state, and then the resin 2 is cured under the high pressure condition caused by the fact that when the resin 2 gets into among the conductors 4 in the sheath 3 due to its volume expansion during foaming, the resistance against the fluidity of the resin 2 is increased with progress of curing, so that the pressure of the resin 2 in the mold 5 is increased. Thus, it is possible to manufacture a highly airtight dam in a much shortened time and no, or a much simplified one if necessary, flow stopper for the dam resin is needed at the edge portion of the sheath, so the productivity thereof is much improved.
