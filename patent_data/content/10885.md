# Computerized tomographic apparatus.

## Abstract
In a computerized tomographic apparatus of the kind in which the performances of different detectors is normali sed by causing them to receive radiation along substantial ly similar paths in various overlap zones within a body un der examination, the normalisation can be adversely affec ted by the amount of radiation exposure suffered by each detector prior to its receipt of radiation along the paths in the overlap zones. The invention permits such adverse ef fects to be reduced or eliminated by averaging the electri cal signals, produced by the detectors in respect of the paths in the overlap zones the signals relating to paths near the centre of an overlap zone being combined with the signals relating to other paths distributed substantially across the overlap zone but the signals relating to paths near the edges of an overlap zone being combined with the signals relating to only a few, neighbouring, paths.
