# Enzyme electrode membrane, method of making same and polarographic cell structure.

## Abstract
A membrane for electrochemical analysis is described comprising a first, relatively dense and thin layer and a second, relatively porous thick layer, which thick layer has dispersed therethrough the enzyme glucose oxidase. The process of making the membrane by casting two to three layers of cellulose acetate compositions is also described.
