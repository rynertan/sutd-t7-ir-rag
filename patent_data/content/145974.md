# TELESCOPING POLYGONAL STEERING COLUMN

## Abstract
A steering column comprises inner and outer hex agonal shaped shafts 12, 16 , the inner shaft 12 being disposed within a bore 14 of the outer shaft 16 . A mecha nism for eliminating lost motion or lash between the two shafts comprises a plurality of slots 20 located in the outer shaft 16 , the slots being circumferentially offset relative to one another. Wedges 22, 23 are located in respective slots 20 and abut corresponding polygonal surfaces of the inner shaft 12 , with a collar 28 telescoped over the inner and outer shafts and having inclined ramps 30 at the interior thereof in alignment with respective wedges 22, 23 and slots 20 , the ramps loading and causing inward movement of the wedges against the surfaces of the inner shaft 12 upon axial movement of the collar 28 relative to the outer shaft 16 . A spring member 29 telescoped over the inner and outer shafts biases the collar member 28 axially into engagement with the wedges 22, 23 whereby a plurality of surfaces 13, 17 of the inner shaft 12 engage in surface to surface contact a plurality of adjacent surfaces 18, 21 of the outer shaft 16 .
