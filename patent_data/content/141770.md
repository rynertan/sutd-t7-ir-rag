## Abstract
The bore of the compressor for a gas turbine engine is heated by selectively bleeding compressor air from down stream stages so that heating only occurs at discreet times during the engine operating envelope. The bled air is ad mitted into the bore at the mid stage station of the com pressor wherein the compressor disks are scrubbed so as to expand and close the gap between the outer air seal and tips of the compressor blades during cruise of the aircraft and prevented from heating the disks during the high powered operations of the engine.
