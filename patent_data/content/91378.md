# Frequency conversion unit.

## Abstract
A frequency conversion unit comprising a local oscilla tor, first and second mixers, a first hybrid circuit and a second hybrid circuit, the mixers receiving, via the first hybrid circuit, local oscillation outputs from the local oscilla tor, and the second hybrid circuit receiving outputs from the first and second mixers, thereby producing a frequency conversion output signal therefrom. Intermediate frequency signals used in the first and second mixers are π radian out of phase with each other. The first hybrid circuit produces outputs for the first and second mixers having a predeter mined phase difference of ₁ therebetween . The second hybrid circuit receives outputs from the first and second mixers and combine them after making a phase difference of π ₁ therebetween.
