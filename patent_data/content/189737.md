# A SOLID FUEL BOILER

## Abstract
A solid fuel boiler, particularly for domestic heating, has a fuel charge chamber 2 of elongate cylindrical conforma tion which is completely immersed in a heat exchange fluid contained in a casing 4 . An electric fan 6 draws air from outside the boiler and directs it through a duct 5 into the fuel charge chamber 2 which, in its lower part, communi cates with a combustion chamber 12 , also immersed in the said heat exchange fluid, and which in turn communicates with a plurality of tubes 13 which extend vertically along side the fuel charge chamber 2 , and lead into a smoke collection chamber 20 from which the smoke can escape through a flue outlet.
