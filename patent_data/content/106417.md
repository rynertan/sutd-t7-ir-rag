## Description
Integrated circuit comprising an input protection device. The invention relates to an integrated circuit IC comprising a semiconductor body having a surface, a field oxide region extending at the surface and laterally individually surrounding active semiconductor regions containing electronic elements of the circuit and a protection device for preventing an input signal applied to a terminal of the integrated circuit from damaging a section of the circuit coupled to said terminal, said protection device comprising a thick oxide insulated gate field effect transistor, whose source receives a first voltage, whose drain and whose gate electrode are coupled to said terminal and whose gate dielectric consists at least partly of a part of said field oxide region. IC s are prone to damage from electrostatic discharge ESD . This is especially true for metal oxide semiconductor MOS IC s whose field effect transistors FET s utilize thin gate dielectrics that rupture at moderate voltages. For example, conventional MOS gate dielectrics employ about 500 1,000 angstroms of silicon dioxide which ruptures at 6 9 volts 100 angstroms. Thus, 30 volts across a 500 angstrom oxide dielectric could destroy it. In addition to oxide rupture, ESD currents on the order of an ampere often appear at the IC terminals.If the heat generated by these currents is not properly dissipated, electromigration of the metal in the lead pattern and microdiffusion of dopants in the IC can occur.The result is a short between the IC s substrate region and the lead pattern. Generally, an MOS IC is most susceptible to ESD damage during assembly, test, transfer, and installation when a voltage generated by a person handling the IC discharges across it. A person can easily develop 1,000 10,000 volts. The destructive effect of this high voltage is partially alleviated by the source resistance of the human body. However, the resulting ESD signal can still be very damaging. To prevent dielectric rupture, a protection device for dissipating ESD energy is conven tionally connected between each input terminal of anMOS IC and its operative section. In the accompanying drawing Fig. 1 is a diagram indicating how an IC input protection device interacts with a circuit modeling the human body. Figs. 2 and 3 are circuit diagrams of prior artIC input protection devices. Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of an input protection device according to the invention for preventing damage to a gate in an NMOS IC. Fig. 5 is a schematic of a floating gate FET used in Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a cross sectional layout view of an embodiment of the structure of the input protection device of Fig. 4 taken through plane 6 6 in Figs. 7a, 7b and 7c. Figs. 7a, 7b and 7c are cross sectional side views of the structure of Fig. 6 taken through planes 7a 7a, 7b 7b and 7c 7c, respectively. Fig. 8 is a cross sectional layout view of an other embodiment of the structure of the input protection device of Fig.4 taken through plane 8 8 in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 is a cross sectional side view of the structure of Fig. 8 taken through plane 9 9. In evaluating such an input protection device, a circuit representing the human body is conventionally employed. Fig. 1 illustrates how such a human body circuit interacts with an IC 10 having an input terminal 12 that receives the resulting ESD input signal VI from the human body. In this circuit, a source voltage V5 representing the actual ESD voltage is applied through a two pole switch 14 to a grounded capacitor CS representing the human body capacitance of about 100 200 picofards. After capacitor C5 is charged to Vs, switch 14 is moved from its charging position to its discharging position.Capacitor C5 then discharges through a resistor R5 representing the human body resistance of 1,000 2,000 ohms so as to generate signal VI. Terminal 12 is connected to an input protection device 16 which operates on signal VI to produce a modified input signal Vc that is desirably not strong enough to damage a protected gate 18 of IC 10 to which signal Vc is supplied. Insofar as device 16 protects gate 18, resistor R5 is part of the operational dynamics since it modulates the V5 discharge from capacitor Cs. Numerous types of devices have been considered for IC input protection. J. Keller, Protection of MOS integrated Circuits from Destruction by ElectrostaticDischarge , Proceedings of the 1980 ElectricalOverstress Electrostatic Discharge Symposium, pp. 73 80, provides a good summary of various MOS input protection circuits. Fig. 2 illustrates one of the prior art input protection schemes discussed by Keller for IC 10 when it is an N channel MOS NMOS IC fabricated on a semiconductor substrate having a P type substrate region which receives a reference voltage Vss. In this protection device 16, an N type diffused resistor RA connected between terminal 12.and gate 18 limits the current flow. Resistor RA does not have a high value, however, because it would un acceptably attenuate signal Vc. Even a moderate RA value such as 1,000 ohms which is conventional may unduly attenu ate the VC voltage. The P type substrate region forms a PN diode JA with the N type material of resistor RA. Diode JA is normally reverse biased. Its reverse breakdown voltage VBD is less than the rupture voltage VR of the thin oxide gate dielectrics in IC 10. Assuming that V55 is ground, diode JA breaks down by avalanching to provide a path for transmitting the VI current to the Vss supply when the VI voltage reaches VBD. This is intended to prevent the VI voltage from rising to V However, due to the time needed for breakdown to occur, the VI voltage may still pass VBD and reach VR to damage gate 18. Diode JA is typically useful for V5 values up to several hundred volts above which it permanently breaks down. When the VI voltage drops slightly below ground, diode JA turns on to provide positive current from the V55 supply.This prevents voltage VI from dropping to VBD and likewise protects gate 18. An N channel enhancement mode thin oxide insulated gate FET QA is conventionally employed with elements RA and JA. FET QA is a punch through FET whose drain is connected between resistor RA and gate 18 and whose insulated gate is connected through a parasitic resistance RB to the QA source which, in turn, is connected to the Vss supply through a parasitic resistanceRC. Because they are the inherent resistances of the elec trical connections for the QA gate and source, resistancesRB and RC are small, typically no more than 25 50 ohms each. When the V voltage is positive, FET QA protects gate 18 principally by punch through as the depletion region of the QA drain extends to the QA source to provide a conductive path to the Vss supply.FET QA also lowers the breakdown voltage of the portion of diode JA near the QA drain. Where the gate dielectrics in IC 10 are about 1,000 angstroms, human body resistor R5 is about 1,500 ohms, and human body capacitor C5 is about 100 picofarads, the combination of FET QA and resistor diode RA and JA prevents V5 values up to about 1,500 volts from damaging gate 18. Fig. 3 illustrates another example of device 16 described by Keller for IC 19 when it is an NMOS IC. InFig. 3, device 16 again contains diffused resistor diodeRA and JA connected and operable as before. A PN diodeJB whose anode is the P type substrate region at Vss and whose cathode is connected to terminal 12 functions in the manner described for diode JA. The important addition to device 16 in Fig. 3 is an N channel enhancement mode thick oside insulated gate FET QB whose drain is connected to gate 18. The QB source receives voltage Vss while the QB insulated gate is connected to terminal 12. The gate dielectric of FET QB consists of part of a silicon dioxide field region that laterally individually surrounds active semiconductor regions containing electronic components of IC 10. This field oxide gate dielectric is of such a thickness that the threshold voltage VT of FET QB is less than VR but greater than the VI levels reached during normal IC operation. Should the V voltage rise above the VT ofFET QB, it turns on so as to provide a path to the V55 supply to inhibit the VI voltage from rising further.Should the VI voltage attempt to rise even further, FET QB acts as a punch through FET in which its drain depletion region extends to its source so as to provide a wider current path to the V55 supply. For the conditions given above for Fig. 2, input protection devices employing thick oxide FET s such as FET QB can prevent damage at V5 values up to 2,500 3,000 volts. Under more stringent conditions where, for example, the gate dielectric thickness is 500 angstroms, R5 is 1,000 ohms, and C5 is 200 picofarads, the above devices do not perform as well. It does not appear that they would provide protection at VS values of 1,500 volts or more.Moreover, most of the ESD energy is dissipated at the front end of resistor RA connected to terminal 12 becauseFET QA or QB is connected to the bak end of resistor RA.This can lead to metal electromigration and dopand microdiffusion near the front end of resistor RA. In accordance with the invention an integrated circuit as described in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the protection device further comprises an enhancement mode insulated gate field effect transistor whose source receives the first voltage, whose drain is coupled to said terminal and whose gate electrode is coupled. to one end of a resistor, the other end of said resistor receiving a second voltage, the drain of the enhancement made field effect transistor being integral with the drain of the thick oxide field effect transistor, the enhancement mode field effect transistor having a channel width of at least 25 microns and the thick oxide fieldeffect transistor having a channel width of at least 25 microns. The IC is formed from a semiconductor body having a primary monocrystalline semiconductive region with which the source and drain each define a PN junction. The enhancement mode FET is usually off during test as well as normal IC operation. Because of the resistor s presence, the enhancement mode FET acts temporarily as a floating gate FET for a short period of time after the input signal changes. During this time period, the voltage at the insulated gate floats at a value dependent on the ratio of the parasitic capacitance of the insulated gate to the drain and the parasitic capacitance of the insulated gate to the source and primary region. The momentary change in the gate voltage is normally around 10 15 of the input voltage change.For a 1 volt threshold voltage, the enhancement mode FET turns on when the input signal rises about 8 volts so as to provide a conductive path for discharging the input signal to the first voltage. As the input signal rises further, the enhancement mode FET turns on harder. This progressively slows further increase in the input voltage. The net effect is to prevent the input voltage from reaching the MOS thin oxide gate dielectric rupture voltage. The drains are desirably coupled to the terminal along semiconductive material of the drains extending to extreme points encompassing most of their widths so as to distribute current flowing between the sources and drains.This alleviates heat build up so as to avoid damage that could otherwise occur from dopant microdiffusion and metal electromigration. The primary region is maintained at the second reference voltage. If the enhancement mode FET is N channel, the second voltage is preferably less than the first voltage plus the FET S threshold voltage. Conversely, if the enhancement mode FET is p channel, the second voltage is preferably greater than the first voltage plus the FET s threshold voltage. Accordingly, the enhancement mode FET is normally off and turns on only when the input signal approaches a voltage that could damage the IC. Where it is an MOS IC, it can then maintain its high input impedance.The thick oxide FET protects the IC section by the turn on and punch through mechanisms generally described above.Furthermore by having the drains of the enhancement mode and thick oxide FET s integral, they cooperate in preventing damage to the IC section. Further protection is provided by an input resistor coupled between the terminal and the IC section.Because the other elements of the present input protection device are coupled to the front end of the input resistor, it has to dissipate much less energy than in the prior art.This avoids metal electromigration and dopant mic ro diffusion in the vicinity of the input resistor. It is preferably about 200 ohms which is much lower than in the prior art and does not significantly attenuate the input voltage. When the oxide gate dielectric thickness is about 500 angstroms at 1,000 ohms and 200 picofarads for the human body resistance and capacitance, the present device prevents damage to the IC section at ESD voltages of 2,000 volts or more. This is much better than the above prior art devices could achieve under the same conditions. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to a few embodiments and figs. 4 to 9 of the drawing. Like reference symbols are employed in the drawing and in the description of the preferred embodiments to represent the same or very similar item or items. Figs. 6 and 8 are dralçn substantially to scale.The solid lines in Figs. 6 and 8 represent elements actu ally appearing at planes 6 6 and 8 8 respectively. The non solid lines represent elements lying below planes 6 6 and 8 8. In particular, the dotted lines represent poly crystalline silicon polysilicon regions. The dot anddash lines represent N doped monocrystalline silicon regions. The dashed lines represent apertures through dielectric material down to underlying silicon. Fig. 4 illustrates a circuit embodiment of the present input protection device 16 which operates on input signal VI appearing at terminal 12 in such a manner as to generate signal VC at voltage levels that do not damage gate 18. Signal VC is supplied to the insulated gate of a typical FET QO in gate 18. Terminal 12, device 16, and gate 18 FET QO are part of IC 10 which is anNMOS IC here. The rupture voltage VR of the silicondioxide gate dielectric of FET QO is as little as 30 volts. Device 16 in Fig. 4 contains a pair of N channel enhancement mode thin oxide insulated gate FET s Q1 andQ2 whose respective drains D1 and D2 are connected to terminal 12. Their sources S1 and S2 each receive reference voltage Vss which is preferably off chip ground to volt during normal operation with IC 10 powered. Each FET Q1 and Q2 has a threshold voltage VTG of about 1 volt. The insulated gate G1 of FET Q1 is connected to one end of a resistor R1 whose other end receives a back bias reference voltage VBB which is preferably the substrate voltage.The insulated gate G2 of FET Q2 is similarly connected to one end of a resistor R2 whose other end receives voltageVBB. The use of resistors R1 and R2 enables FET s Q1 andQ2 to act temporarily as floating gate FET s when the VI voltage changes. During normal IC operation, FET s Q1 and Q2 are preferably off. This means that VBB must be less than Vss VTG since the voltage at gate G1 or G2 is VBB during normal operation. An on chip substrate bias generator not shown preferably provides voltage VBB at a value several volts below Vss. If no substrate bias generator is employed, voltages VBB and V55 are the same. When IC 10 is not powered, two situations arise.Firstly, while IC 10 is being handled, voltages Vss andVBB float. Because there is no mechanism to cause voltage VBB to rise above Vss by VTG or more, FET s Q1 and Q2 do not go into the conductive on state. Secondly, during test, voltage VSS is normally fixed at ground. If voltagesVBB and Vss are the same, there is no difference betweenVBB and V55 to turn on FET s Q1 and Q2. If voltagesVBB and VSS are not the same, voltage VBB floats but at a value insufficient in itself to turn on FET s Q1 and Q2.In short, any voltage difference that may exist between voltages VBB and V55 does not itself turn on FET s Q1 and Q2 when IC 10 is unpowered. When E5D or other phenomena cause the VI voltage to reach about 8 volts above VSS, FET s Q1 and Q2 temporarily turn on to discharge the VI voltage towards VSS and thereby prevent damage to gate 18 FET QO. This also protests FET s Q1 and Q2. In discussing the mechanism which causes FET s Q1 and Q2 to turn on, it is assumed for convenience that voltage VSS is ground reference. If voltage VSS is not actually ground, the actual value ofVss must be subtracted from the various voltages. The final result is the same. Understanding the mechanism which causes FET s Q1 and Q2 to turn on is facilitated with the aid of Fig. 5 which depicts an FET Q representing FET Q1 or Q2. A resistor R representing resistor R1 or R2 is connected between the VBB supply and the gate electrode G of FET Q.Its drain D receives the VI voltage, and its source S receives voltage VSS. Source S and drain D each define aPN junction with a substrate region B which receives voltage VBB Gate dielectric I separates gate G from sourceS, drain D, and substrate region B. As indicated in Fig. 5, a parasitic capacitanceCM exists between gate G and drain D. Between gate G, on one hand, and source S and substrate region B, on the other hand, is another parasitic capacitance CG Capacitances CM and CG form a capacitive voltage divider that sets and attempts to hold the voltage VG of gate G at a value VFGwhen the VI voltage changes by an amount t VI. By balancing charges, VFG is VBB VI 1 CG CM . That is AVG AVI equals 1 1 CG CM where VG is the change in voltage VG Opposing the effort to hold voltageVG at VFG is the coupling through resistor R to the VBB supply that provides a path to discharge voltage VG toVBB. Resistor R temporarily prevents gate voltage VG from discharging to VBB or, perhaps more accurately, slows down the VG discharge rate so as to enable voltageVG to remain near VFG for a short period of time. ResistorR thus effectively isolates gate G from the VBB supply during this short time period so as to make FET Q temporarily a floating gate FET whose gate voltage VG depends on the parasitic capacitance ratio CG CM. Transient change VG is normallyabout 10 15 of change VI. When voltage VFGexceeds threshold level VTG, FET Q turns on for a short period of time to provide a path for discharging the VI voltage. Because of the time needed to transmit the VI energy through FET Q to the V55 supply, signal VI does not instantaneously drop to Vss. Instead, signal VI normally rises more. As voltage VFG also rises, FET Q turns on harder. This increases the conductance of FET Q so as to progressively slow down theVI rise. The result is that FET Q and resistor R prevents the VI voltage from rising more than about 25 volts aboveVSS. This is less than the 30 volt VR of FET QO and thus protects it. Eventually, voltage VG returns to VBB FET Q then acts as a thin oxide punch through FET. The ratio CG CM is determined approximately as follows. As shown in Fig. 5, gate G of FET Q has a lengthLG and overlaps drain D by an amount LM. Capacitance CM is the product of LM and a proportionality constant which includes the width of gate G . To a rough approximation, capacitance CG is the product of LG LM and the same proportionality constant. Accordingly, CG CM equals LG LM 1. Therefore, t VG ss VI equals LM LG. LG LM is normally about 7 10 and is preferably 8, leading to the above VI level at which FET Q turns on. During ESD testing with a circuit such as that of Fig. 1, voltage Vss is set at ground. Voltage VBB floats but at a value near ground. Signal VI is initially ground.The fore go in VFG relationship then simplifies to VFG VI equals 1 1 CG CM which equals LM LG. Since thresholdVTG is about 1 volt, FET Q turns on when the VI voltage rises to about 8 volts. Returning to Fig. 4, device 16 contains further elements that cooperate with FET S Q1 and Q2 to protect gate 18. Among these elements is an N channel enhancementmode thick oxide FET Q3 whose drain D3 and insulated gateG3 are connected to terminal 12 to receive signal II The source S3 of FET Q3 receives voltage Vss The gate dielectric of FET Q3 principally consists of silicon dioxide having a thickness of 1.2 1.4 microns. The VT of FET Q3 is about 20 volts. FET Q3 is normally off. Assuming again that voltage Vss is ground, FET Q3 turns on if the VI voltage reaches the 20 volt VT of FET Q3. This establishes a path to discharge the VI voltage to Vss and inhibits further VI increase.Also, FET Q3 may act as a punchthrough FET. Another of the protection elements is a PN diode J1 whose cathode C1 is connected to terminal 12 and whose anode Al receives voltage VBB The reverse breakdown voltage VBD of diode J1 is about 14 volts. Its forward threshold conductive drop VF is about 0.7. volt. When voltage VI is positive and exceeds VBB by at least the 14 volt VBD of diode J1, it breaks down to provide a path for transmitting the VI current to theVBB supply. On the other hand, when the VI voltag e is negative and drops below VBB by the 0.7 volt VF of diodeJ1, it turns on to enable the VBB supply to provide positive current to terminal 12. This prevents signal VI from dropping further. The final protective element in device 16 is a resistor R3 connected between terminal 12 and gate 18. The purpose of resistor R3 is to momentarily isolate the peak VI voltage long enough from signal VC to allow elements Q1, Q2, Q3 and J1 to lower the peak VI voltage below VR. Inasmuch as resistor R3 is a diffused element, associated with it is a PN diode J2 whose cathode C2 consists of the resistive material of resistor R3 and whose anode A2 receives voltage VBB. Fig. 6 illustrates a cross sectional layout view of a preferred embodiment of about half of device 16 ofFig. 4. In particular, Fig. 6 shows all of FET Q1, part of resistors R1 and R3, and about half of FET Q3 and diodeJ1. The remaining unshown half of this layout is substantially symmetrical about center line 20 except for the lower left hand portion of Fig. 6 where resistor R3 is located. That is, FET Q2 and resistor R2 are configured as mirror images of FET Q1 and resistor R1, and the unshown half of FET Q3 and diode J1 is configured largely as a mirror image of the half shown. Fig. 7a and 7b show cross sectional side views of the embodiment of Fig. 6 and center on FET Qi. Fig. 7c depicts another cross sectional side view of the embodiment of Fig. 6 and centers on FETQ3.This embodiment is particularly suitable for MOS circuits that use buried contacts. In this embodiment, the active transistor elements are formed along a surface 22 in a semiconductor body containing a P monocrystalline silicon semiconductive substrate region 24. The monocrystalline electronic elements lie in active semiconductor regions individually laterally separated from one another by a composite electrically insulating region consisting of a recessed field region 26 of silicon dioxide and an underlying highly doped P region 28. Field oxide region 26 extends about 2,000 angstroms above and below surface 22. P region 28 extends about 1.2 microns below oxide region 26. Drains D1, D2 and D3 and cathode C1 are an integral Ns region D1 D2 D3 C1 that extends about 4,000 angstroms below surface 22 to define a PN junction withP region 24 which serves as anode Al. Resistor R3 and cathode C2 consists of an N region R3 C2 continuous with region D1 D2 D3 C1 and extending to about the same depth below surface 22. P region 24 so serves as anode A2. Each source S1, S2 or S3 is an N region that likewise extends to about the same depth below surface 22 to define a junction with P region 24. Above surface 22, the gate dielectric I1 forFET Q1 or the unshown gate dielectric I2 for FET Q2 is a layer of silicon dioxide having a thickness of about 500 angstroms. Overlying gate G1 or G2 consists of an N type region of polysilicon. Resistor R1 or R2 is an N type polysilicon strip continuous with respective gate G1 orG2. Lying over part of region D1 D2 D3 C1 and extending along its entire width i.e., in a direction perpendicular to the current flow between source S1, S2 or S3 and regionD1 D2 D3 C1 and making buried contact with it all along its width is another N type polysilicon strip 30. An electrically insulating layer 32 of 8 phosphorus doped silicon dioxide Vapox lies on polysilicon regions G1, R2, G2, R2 and 30 and on portions of oxide region 26 and N regions S1, S2, S3 and f l D2 D3 Cl. Vapox layer 32 has a thickness of about 1 micron. As shown in Fig. 7c, the gate dielectric I3 of FET Q3 consists of the portion of oxide region 26 whose lower sidewalls lie between source S3 and region D1 D2 D3 C1 plus the overlying portion of Vapox layer 32. An electrically conductive pattern 34 of aluminum with about 1 silicon overlies Vapox layer 32 and extends down through apertures 36 in layer 32 to contact poly silicon strip 30. This provides a connection to terminal 12 which consists of the portion of conductive pattern 30 in the middle and upper part of the right half ofFig. 6. Apertures 36 are spaced apart along nearly all of poly silicon strip 30 which makes buried contact with regionD1 D2 D3 C1. Accordingly, apertures 36 are spaced apart along nearly the entire widths of the portions of region D1 D2 D3 C1 that actually serve as drains D1, D2 and D3 as well as along nearly all of cathode Cl. This distributes the positive current flowing from region D1 D2 D3 C1 to sources S1, D2 and S3 and anode Al so as to prevent current crowding and consequent damage t6 region D1 D2 D3 C1 itself. Pattern 34, which is about 1 micron thick, also extends down to surface 22 through apertures 38 in layer 32 to contact sources S1, S2 and S3.Apertures 38 are similarly spaced apart along nearly the entire widths of sources Slr S2 and S3 to prevent current crowding. Near the lateral edge of terminal 12, it has apertures 40 that extend through it down to Vapox layer 32. Apertures 40 are employed for alignment during assembly bonding. A passivating l ayer 42 of silicon nitride having a thickness of about 1.5 microns overlies the resulting structure except for portion of terminal 12 that serves as a bonding pad. Although the top of layer 42 does not appear in Fig. 6 so as to indicate the precise location of the bonding pad, its location can be ascertained by referring to Figs. 7a an d 7c. Fig. 8 illustrates a cross sectional layout view of an alternative embodiment of device 16 of Fig. 4. Fig.9 is a cross sectional side view of a portion of Fig. 8 centering on FET Q1. Inasmuch as the structure of this embodiment is configured largely the same as the structure of the previous embodiment, elements in Figs. 8 and 9 corresponding to elements in Figs. 6, 7a, 7b and 7c are labeled with the same reference symbols. The principal difference between the two embodiments is that polysilicon strip 30 is absent in the alternative embodiment. Instead, the portion of conductive pattern 34 forming terminal 12 directly contacts region D1 D2 D3 C7 by way of apertures 36. They are spaced apart along nearly the entire widths of the portions of region D1 D2 D3 C1 that actually serve as drains D1, D2 and D3 as well as along nearly all of cathode C1.This again distributes current flowing from region Di D2 D3 Cl to sources S1, S2 and S3 and anode Al in order to prevent current crowding. The alternative embodiment is specifically suited for use in MOS circuits that do not use buried contacts. Fig. 9 particularly illustrates one of alignment apertures 40 in conductive pattern 34. In combination with apertures 36 and 38, the width of each FET Q1 or Q2 is at least 25 microns so as to avoid current crowding. The Q1 or Q2 width is preferably about 125 microns in both structural embodiments. Similarly, resistors R1 and R2 are each no less than 100 ohms so as to assure that FET s Q1 and Q2 temporarily act as floatinggate FET s. Resistors R1 and R2 are each preferably 300 ohms. Preferably the channel width of FET Q3 is at least 25 microns. FET Q3 has an even more preferred width of 125 microns in both embodiments. Resistor R3 is about 200 ohms. Diode J1 has an area of about 4,000 micron2. VoltagesVBB and Vss are 3 volts and 0 volt, respectively, during normal operation. Methods for manufacturing the various elements of the present invention are well known in the semiconductor art. Conventional masking, etching, and cleaning techniques which are not further referred to in order to simplify the discussion are employed in creating the various doped regions. Except as indicated below, both embodiments of Fig.4 are manufactured in the following manner. The starting material is a P monocrystalline silicon substrate having a resistivity of about 25 ohm cm.Field oxide region 26 and P region 28 are formed according to conventional techniques, boron being selectively im planted at 2x1013 ions cm2 into the field areas of the substrate and then being driven downward to form P region 28 as oxide region 26 is formed. This creates the field oxide portion of gate dielectric 13 with part of P region 28 underlying this field oxide portion. A 500 angstrom layer of silicon dioxide is thermally grown along the top of the substrate. Boron is then selectively implanted into the channels of the variousFET s to set their threshold voltages. The 500 angstrom oxide layer is selectively etched to leave gate dielectrics I1 and I2. A polysilicon layer is deposited on the top of the structure, doped by diffusion with phosphorus to attain a sheet resistance of about 25 ohms aquare, and then selec tively etched to form regions G1, G2, R1 R2 and 30. In the case of the alternative embodiment, the portion of the polysilicon layer that would otherwise form region 30 is also etched away.Using gates G1 and G2 in combination with dielectrics I1 and I2 to provide self alignment, arsenic is selectively implanted into the top of the structure and then thermally driven in to create N regions D1 D2 D3 C1,R3 C2, S1, S2 and S3 at a sheet resistance of about 30 ohms square. Vapox layer 32 is deposited on the top of the structure and selectively etched to form apertures 36 and 38. Conductive pattern 34 is formed by depositing an appropriate layer of silicon aluminum and selectively etching it. The structure is then completed by depositing passivation layer 42 and selectively etching it to expose the bonding pad. While the invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, this description is solely for the purpose of illustration and is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention claimed below. For example, semiconductor materials of opposite conductivity type to those described above may be employed to accomplish the same results. The back bias voltage supplied to the insulated gate of each floating gate FET by way of its resistor could conceivably be of such a value as to make it conductive during normal IC operation in this case, the input signal would likely have to be stronger during normal operation. While two llfloating gate FET resistor combinations in parallel have been described, a different number could be employed. The present input protection device could beused on bipolar IC s. Thus, various modifications, changes, and applications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
