# Method of producing high speed steel products metallurgically.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a powder metallurgical method for producing high speed steel products, the shape of which is close to the desired final shape of the product, i.e. according to the so called near net shape technique. The method comprises the following steps a a starting powder consisting of high speed steel is soft annealed in a first annealing step in a non oxidising environ ment, b the soft annealed powder is fragmented mechanically, c the fragmented powder is annealed in the austenitic region of the steel in a second annealing step in a non oxidising environment thereby to improve the compactabil ity of the fragmented powder by reducing its hardness and by forming aggregates of fragmented particles, compactabil ity signifying the ability of the powder to form a manageable powder body, a so called green body, d the powder is compacted mechanically, after being annealed and having formed aggregates in said second annealing step, in a die to form a green body of the desired product shape, e the green body is sintered in a non oxidising environ ment until communicating porosity has been eliminated, and f the sintered body is subjected to hot isostatic compac tion to full density.
