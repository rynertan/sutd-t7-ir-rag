# Synthetic polymer propellant compositions forming cold foamed structures.

## Abstract
The compositions comprise a a film forming synthetic polymer in an amount within the range from about 2 to about 30 by weight of the composition b at least one liquefied propellant boiling below 10 C c the total propellant being in an amount within the range from about 50 to about 90 by weight of the com position and having a heat of vaporization of at least 55 calories per gram the propellant being capable of dissolv ing the synthetic polymer at least in the presence of a co solvent that is soluble in the propellant and in solutions of the synthetic polymer in the propellant at ambient tem perature and d at least one nonsolvent that is soluble in the propel lant solution but in which the synthetic polymer is insoluble in an amount within the range from about 1 to about 85 by weight of the composition. Upon volatilization of propellant at ambient tem perature and pressure compositions form a foamed struc ture containing open and or closed cells and having a tem perature at least 30 C below ambient temperature.
