## Description
This invention is directed to a molding compostion comprising a blend of a a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, of which more than about 65 mole percent is terephthalic acid based on total acid, b a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and a mixture of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid, of which more than about 70 mole percent is isophthalic acid based on total acid, and c at least one thermoplastic polymer compatible therewith. Polyarylates are aromatic polyesters derived from a dihydric phenol, particularly 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane also identified as Bisphenol A and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, particularly mixtures of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. Generally, polyarylates produced from bisphenol A and a mixture of 50 mole percent each of isophthalic and terephthalic acids are most preferred and are sold commercially. These preferred polyarylates have been blended with other resin systems, such as ABS resin U.S. Patent 3,792,118 , polycarbonate resins U.S. Patent 3,792,115 , polyurethane resins, alkyl acrylate resins, etc. to enhance one or more properties of the polyarylate. However, the preferred polyarylates have a crystallinity which is quite limited. When such a polyarylate is blended with another polymer, the resulting mixture is amorphous.The properties of an article molded from this blend, such as environmental stress crack resistance, are inferior and thus the article cannot be readily used wher such a property is required. U.S. Patent 3,728,416 describes a process for the preparation of copolymers from a copolymer derived from terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and bisphenol A and a homopolymer derived from isophthalic acid and bisphenol A, by extruding a molten mixture of the copolymer and the hoinopolymer whereby copolynerization of the two polymers Occurs in situ to produce a randomized copolymer The copolymer component is stated in the patent to be composed of 70 95 percent of terephthalic acid, 30 5 mole percent of isophthalic acid and 100 mole percent of bisphenol A. The patent states that the extruded copolymer does not exhibit the individual characteristics of the two components from which it is derived but, in the extrusion process, has become a homogeneous material that exhibits desirable non crystallizing and other desirable characteristics ani properties of a polymer prepared from approximately equal parts of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid with bisphenol A by the difficultly operable solid phase method. The mixing conditions stated in this patent are such that ester exchange of the components can lead to a more random structure. It has been found that less severe mixing conditions leads to a blend of the same components as in U.S.Patent 3,728,416 that maintains certain individual features, e.g., crystallization of the components. One method by which this can be achieved is to blend with the polyarlates a and b a third component which has a lower melt viscosity and exhibits mechanical compatibility with polyarylate. The lower melt viscosity of the resultant blend allows for lower mixing temperatures, thus decreased ester excha9ge of the polyarylate constituents of the blend. It has nod been fount that when a polyarylate having a terephthalic acid content of more than about 65 mole percent, and a polyarylate having an isophthalic acid content of more than about 70 mole percent are blended with a thermoiastic polymer compatible therewith, an article molded from such a composition has a good balance of mechanical properties, improved environmental stress crack resistance and chemical resistance.Also, such molded articles have higher elevated temperature stiffness after annealing as compared to annealed articles molded from polyarylates produced from bisphenol A and a mixture of intermediate isophthalic and terephthalic acid ratios and the same thermoplastic resin compatible therewith.
