# Optical position transducer.

## Abstract
An optical transducer for detecting the position of a rotary or translatory member comprises a light source, a photodetector group 37 and a shutter 25 provided with a series of transparent elements 28 spaced by opaque regions 29 and interposed between the light source and the photodetector group. The latter comprises an integrated circuit, on a surface of which are disposed numerous photovoltaic cells 37 each being of an area which is a fraction of the area of each transparent element 28 . The cells are divided into four groups to generate as many electrical signals which are out of phase relative to each other by 90 and which are indicative of the position of the shutter with respect to the position of the photodetector group and the light source. The cells 37 are disposed symmetrically with respect to a central optical axis 40 , and in such a way that the barycentre of illumination of each of the four groups is coincident with that optical axis. The sum of the four electrical signals is also used as feedback for control of the power supply for the light source.
