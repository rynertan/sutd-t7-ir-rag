## Description
REAGENT FOR IMMUNOLOGICAL DETERMINATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the invention This invention relates to a reagent for immunological determination. More particularly, this invention relates to a reagent for determination of immunological reaction which has excellent functions such as high S N ratio and is in the form of a microparticle or a sheettype carrier.Description of prior arts There is known a reagent for immunological determination based on immunological reaction such as antigenantibody reaction or immunological reaction utilizing enzyme labeled immunologically active component. For determination of an antigen antibody reaction with high sensitivity in a simple manner, an immunological agglutination method comprising visual observation on agglutination caused by antigen antibody reaction utilizing antigen or antibody carried on a water insoluble particulate carrier has been employed. As the carriers for the immunological agglutination method, red blood cells of animals such as chicken, alligator, sheep, etc., have been used. Using one of these red blood cell carriers, passive heamagglutination PHA has generally been carried out for the immunological determination. This method provides high sensitivity with simple operations. Recently, a method for semi quantitatively determining antigen or antibody very efficiently in a simple manner called microtiter system has ben developed.However, the microtiter system involves disadvantageous problems, for instance, caused by the use of animaloriginating carriers. The red cell carriers per se are antigenic and often cause specific agglutination to adversely affect the desired antigen antibody reaction.Further, efficiency is not uniform depending on variation of the material under analysis, change of its characteristics with the passage of time, etc., and the cost involved is rather high. A latex agglutination method using polystyrene latex as the carrier has also been employed. Although this method is free from the disadvantageous feature encountered in the use of animal originating carrier, this method has other disadvantages, such as poor sensitivity as compared to the passive haemagglutination method, and poor preservability due to weak bonding to the antigen or antibody. Further, natural agglutination, that is, agglutination independent of antigen antibody reaction tends to occur in this method. In UK Patents 2,041,517B and 2,079,936B, use of a microcapsule in place of the conventional carriers is disclosed. According to these disclosures, in the case that the microcapsule is employed as the carrier, a marked improvement in the sensitivity and accuracy is accomplished in the determination of various antibodies or antigens. This is because that microcaplules having a 3 desired specific gravity of 0.8 to 1.20 g cm , preferably 3 1.07 to 1.16 g cm , can be easily prepared in a desired particle size range of 0.1 to 30 pm, preferably 0.5 to 10 Vm, by suitably choosing the core substance of the microcapsules. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of the present invention is to provide a reagent for immunological determination which is particularly improved in the sensitivity or S N ratio. A secondary object of the invention is to provide a reagent for immunological determination which is improved in the sensitivity or S N ratio, as well as free from disadvantageous features attached to the conventional reagent of the same purpose. There is provided by the present invention a reagent for immunological determination in the form of a carrier which is provided on the surface with poly vinyl alcohol having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 and sensitized with an immunologically active component. In the present invention, a preferred carrier is a microcapsule. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has been known that PVA i.e. poly vinyl alcohol can be used for the preparation of microcapsules for inclusion in a pressure sensitive paper Japanese PatentProvisional Publication No. 55 1980 132631 . For the microcapsule employed in a pressure sensitive paper, the density of a capsule wall is one of the important factors. To obtain a microcapsule of high density, there is known an art in that a microcapsule is prepared in the presence of PVA PVA is used as a protective colloid or an emulsifying and dispersing agent . There has been observed a certain correlation between the density ofvthe wall of a microcapsule and the saponification degree ofPVA. Thus, as the protective colloid, PVA having a saponification degree of not lower than 95 is employed.The expected effect, that is, formation of microcapsule wall with high density cannot be attained in the case that PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is employed. The present inventor has discovered that a reagent for immunological determination employing a microcapsule as the carrier shows high sensitivity or S N ratio in the case that PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is provided to the surface of the microcapsule. It has been also discovered that the same effect can be attained in the use of other particulate carriers.Further, the same effect can be attained even in the use of a sheet type carrier or any other type of carrier which is generally used in an immunological determination utilizing an emzyme labeled immunologically active component. The saponification degree of PVA employed in the present invention for the provision to the surface of a carrier should not exceed 90 . PVA having a higher saponification degree than 90 , for example, PVA whose saponification degree is 95 generally employed for the preparation of microcapsules for pressure sensitive paper cannot bring about the effect provided by the use of PVA defined in the present invention. The upper limit of the saponification degree of PVA for attaining the desired effect is very critical. The lower limit thereof is not so critical as the upper limit. The lowest sapontfica tion degree is supposed to be approx. 7b, taking into consideration availability, stability and reproducibility of such PVA. PVA having a saponification degree lower than 70 is generally per se colored, and thus is not suitable for a reagent for immunological determination. The polymerization degree of PVA having saponification degree of not higher than 90 employed in the invention preferably ranges from 100 to 4000. PVA having a relatively lower polymerization degree, for example, not higher than 1000, is preferred for the reagent in the form of microcapsule or other microparticle, while PVA having a rather higher polymerization degree, for example, not lower than 1500 is suitable for the reagent for enzyme immunological determination. The PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 may be incorporated at any stage of the preparation of the reagent, as far as the PVA is provided to the surface of a final product. However, the PVA is preferably added at the following stage. The term microcapsule reagent employed in this specification means a reagent utilizing a microcapsule employable in microtiter method as a carrier. For the preparation of the microcapsule reagent, thePVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 can be provided to the microcapsule at the following stage 1 Stage of addition of a protective colloid or an emulsifying and dispersing agent e.g. poly vinyl alcohol having a saponification degree of not lower than 90 e.g. PVA having a saponification degree of 98 and a polymerization degree of 500 in combination with poly styrenesulfonic acid in the emulsifying process at this stage, the PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is employed in an amount of approx. 1 25 means weight percent , unless otherwise indicated, this being applied to the following of the PVA used as the protective colloid, etc.. 2 Stage after emulsifying procedure the PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is employed in an amount of approx. 5 25 of the PVA used as the protective colloid, etc. 3 Stage for removing unreacted residue of encapsulating reaction by washing with water the PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is provided to the microcapsule using an aqueous solution containing 0.01 5 of the PVA. 4 Stage after sensitization the PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is provided to the microcapsule using an aqueous solution containing 0.01 5 of the PVA. 5 Stage for redispersing microcapsule reagent the PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 is provided to the microcapsule in the form of an aqueous solution for redispersion containing 0.01 5 of the PVA. For the preparation of the reagent such as one in the form of a sheet or strip utilizing an enzymelabeled immunologically active component, the PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 can be provided to the sheet, etc. at the stage after the sensitization by immersing the sheet, etc., in an aqueous solution containing 0.01 5 of the PVA. The reagent for immunological determination prepared by treating the carrier with PVA, a saponification degree of which is not higher than 90 shows the following effects. The microcapsule reagent gives clearly and widely spread agglutination patterns with improved detection sensitivity. Further, the sensitized solution is improved in the preservability. The reagent for enzyme immunological determination decreases as for the blank level and accordingly increases in the sensitivity. It is noted that in the case of a microcapsule reagent, a sensitized solution prepared by employing thePVA defined in the invention together with a protective colloid employing the combination of PVA having a saponification degree not lower than 90 , preferably not lower than 95 e.g., PVA having a saponification degree of 98 and a polymerization degree of 500 and poly styrenesulfonic acid is prominently improved in the preservability. In the case of the reagent for enzyme immunological determination utilizing an enzyme labeled immunologically active component, examples of the carrier in the form of a sheet including strip, test piece, etc. which shows a prominent effect of the PVA treatment employing PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 , include Teflon, cellulose triacetate, cellulose diacetate, polyethylene terephthalate, poly methyl methacrylate , polysulfone, ABS resin, polycarbonate, polystyrene, poly vinyl cholride , polyethylene and nylon. The microcapsule employable as the carrier in the present invention consists essentially of a core of an oily material and a wall. A conventional process for the preparation of a microcapsule is described in detail in, for example, Microcapsule by Asashi Kondo Nikkan KogyoShimbun Co Ltd., 1970 . Detailed description on examples of the oily material, wall material and various kinds of additives is given, for instance, in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication Nos. 57 1982 196621 and 57 1982 196622. The microcapsule can be sensitized with an antigen or antibody by causing the wall of the microcapsule to absorb an antigen or antibody in accordance with known methods. The microcapsule used as the carrier preferably has a specific gravity ranging from 0.85 to 1.25 g cm3, and an mean particle size ranging from 0.5 to 20 pm, more preferably from 1 to 10 Vm. The solid content desirably is approx. 1 3 . The present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples. Example 1 1 Preparation of Microcapsule In a mixture specific gravity 1.14 g cm3 of 8.4 g. of diisopropyl naphthalene and 16.6 g. of chlorinated paraffin Toyoparrux 150, manufactured by Toyo Soda Mfg.Co., Ltd., Japan, chlorination degree 50 was dissolved 0.25 g. of oil soluble red fluqrescent dye Oleosol RedBB, manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan,C.I. 26105 . The resulting solution was mixed with 1.6 g. of 1,1,1 tris 3 isocyanato 4 methylphenyl carbamoyl oxymethyl propane Vernock D 750, manufactured by Dainippon Ink Chemicals Inc., Japan dissolved in 2 g. of methyl ethyl ketone. Thus obtained oily liquid was added under stirring to an aqueous solution of 2 g. of poly vinyl alcohol PVA 105, manufactured by Kuraray Co.,Ltd., Japan, saponification degree 98 , polymerization degree 500 and 1 g. of partial sodium salt of poly styrenesulfonic acid manufactured by Proctor Gamble Co.,VERSA, TL 500, mean molecular weight 500,000 in 75 mL.of water, and the resulting mixture was emulsified to obtain an emulsion having oily drops mean size approx.5 vim. To the resulting emulsion was added 2.6 g. of hexamethylenediamine dissolved in 25 mQ. of water. After the addition was complete, the emulision was diluted with 75 mQ. of water and then a reaction was performed at 700C for 2 hours to complete microencapsulation. Thus produced microcapsules were centrifugally washed with physiological saline solution to remove the unreacted residue, and dispersed in physiological saline solution so as to make a microcapsule dispersion having a microcapsule particle concentration of 10 . 2 Preparation of Microcapsule Reagent 1.5 g. of the microcapsules prepared in the above 1 was diluted by dispersing them in 8.5 mQ. of physiological saline solution. 2 mQ. of a commercially available anti human albumin antibody available from KappelCorp., goat serum, IgG fraction diluted with physiological saline solution as much as 40 times was introduced into 2 m . of the microcapsule containing diluent, and 0 incubated at 37 C fo 90 minutes.After it was subjected to centrifugal separation, the precipitate was dispersed in 4 mQ. of 0.15M phosphate buffered physiological saline solution PBS containing 0.1 of poly vinyl alcohol having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 PVA 205, manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd., saponification degree 88 , polymerization degree 500 , and incu 0 bated at 37 C for 45 minutes. It was then subjected to centrifugally washing with PFS three times, and the mixture was dispersed in 2 m . of PBS containing 3 bovine serum albumin BSA to prepare a reagent for detecting human albumin. Comparison reagent A was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 2 except that the treatment with thePVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 was not carried out. 3 Evaluation of Microcapsule Reagent on Antibody Value The reagent prepared in Example 1 2 was subjected to an antigen antibody reaction by the following procedures in accordance with microtiter method. The tube clearly showing aggulutination was judged to be positive.The maximum dilution number multiple number for the positive serum was obtained, and the obtained number was marked as antibody value. 1 human albumin prepared by Kappel Corp. solution was diluted as much as 10,000 times with PBS containing 1 BSA, and normal goat serum was diluted as much as 10 times with PBS containing 1 BSA as negative control. 25 pQ of each was placed in holes of the microplates havingV shaped bottom, respectively. These portions were diluted with PBS containing 1 BSA so that a series of sample portions whose dilution ratio were sequentially increased by twice were prepared, that is, a lineup of multiple dilutions were prepared. 25 VQ of the microcapsule reagent prepared in Example 1 2 was taken in a dropper and dropwise applied to the holes of the dilution lineup of the sample liquid on the microplate. The microplate was shaken for 5 min. to accelerate the antigen antibody reaction. After the microplate was allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 hours, agglutination patterns on the bottom of the microplate were observed and the antibody values were determined as shown in Table 1. Comparison reagent A was processed in the same manner as described in the above 3 to determine the antibody values as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Microcapsule Reagent Antibody Value Human Albumin Negative Control Reagent of the Invention 2,560,000 20 Comparison Reagent A 1,280,000 20 It was noted that when the reagent of the invention prepared by fixing the anti human albumin antibody to the microcapsules and treating them with PVA having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 was employed in the microtiter method, clear and widely spreading agglutination patterns were formed. Thus obtained agglutination patterns were extremely easy to judge and the detection sensitivity thereof was higher than that obtained by the use of the control reagent A. On the other hand, agglutination patterns formed by the use of the control reagent A were notched in the circumference. Further, it was difficult to distinguish agglutination pattern from sediment because of the insufficient spreading of the pattern. 4 Test for Preservability The reagent of the invention and control reagent A prepared in Example 1 2 were placed in vial bottles, respectively. The bottles were sealed hermetically and stored in a refrigerator kept at 40C for one month. Subsequently, the microtiter test was carried out in the same manner as described in the above 3 to determine antibody values as shown in Table 2. Table 2 after one month lapse Microcapsule Reagent Antibody Value Human Albumin Negative Control Reagent of the Invention 640,000 10 Comparison Reagent A 160,000 10 The results set forth in Table 2 indicate that the deterioration in the sensitiveity of the reagent of the present invention after storage in the refrigerator is less than that of the control reagent A prepared without thetreatment by the PVA having saponification degree of not higher than 904 0. Example 2 Microcapsules were prepared in the same manner as inExample 1 1 except that 0.2 g. of poly vinyl alcohol PVA 205 was further added in 75 mQ. of water in addition to 2 g. of PVA 105 and 1 g. of partial sodium salt of poly styrenesulfonic acid as high molecular protective colloid solution for emulsifying the oily liquid. The anti human albumin antibody was fixed to thus obtained microcapsules to prepare a reagent for detecting human albumin in the same manner as in Example 1 2 except that PVA 205 treatment was not carried out. Example 3 Microencapsulation was carried out according to Example 1 1 . However, the microcapsules were centrifugally washed with simple physiological saline solution for the first time, physiological saline solution containing 0.1 poly vinyl alcohol having a saponification degree of not higher than 90 PVA 205, saponification degree 88 , polymerization degree 500 for the second time, and simple physiological saline solution for the third time. The presipitate was dispersed in simple physiological saline solution so as to prepare a microcapsule dispersion having a microcapsule particle concentration of 10 . The anti human albumin antibody was fixed to the microcapsules in the same manner as in Example 1 2 to prepare a reagent for detecting human albumin. Example 4 The anti human albumin antibody was fixed to the microcapsule prepared in Example 1 1 in the same manner as in Example 1 2 . The microcapsule was then centrifugally washed with PBS and dispersed in 2 mi. of PBS containing 2.5 BSA and 0.1 of PVA 205 to prepare a reagent for detecting human albumin. Evaluation of Microcapsule Reagent Microcapsule reagents prepared in Examples 2 4 were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1 3 by the microtiter method. The similar test was carried out after storage of the reagents in a refrigerator kept at 40C for one month The results are set forth in Table 3.
