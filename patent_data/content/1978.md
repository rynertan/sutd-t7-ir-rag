The potent antihypertensive effect of the compound and its salts of this invention is clear that is, the inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme which converts biologically inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I, to active octapeptide, angiotensin II, is found to be useful as an antihypertensive medicine R.L. Soffer, 1976 M.A. Ondetti, et al., 1977 . In view of the above, we investigated the pharmacological activities of the present antihypertensive agent from the aspect of inhibitory activity against the enzyme. PHARMACOLOGICAL TEST 1 As the method of measurement of angiotensin I converting enzyme activity, bioassay for the contractile response of isolated smooth muscle or the pressor response of normal animals and biochemical assay for the enzyme isolated from lung or other organs of animals are known. The former is more useful than the latter for the examination of the convertion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in vitro R.L. Soffer, 1976. for the evaluation of the novel compound in the yield of medicine. In the present study, we adopted the bioassay for contractile response of isolated guinea pig ileum to angiotensin I.Measurement of inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme. Preparation of isoleted guinea pig ileum was made and suspended in the organ bath containing 20ml of Tyrode s solution casted 95 02 53 Cow at 309C. The contraction induced by angiotensin I 0.125 g ml given at intervals of 10 minutes was recorded on a recticorder Nihon Koden for 90 seconds using FD pick up ST lT H, Nihon Koden . The test compounds were added to the bath 5 minutes before the addition of angiotensin I. The inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme was calculated by the following formula A B A x 100 A Contractile intensity of angiotensin addition cf the compound B Contractile intensity of angiotensin I after addition of the compound The influence of the compounds on the contractile response of isolated guinea pig ileum to angiotensin II was examined in the same manner as above. Further, augmentation of the contractile response to bradykinin by the test compounds was studied by the above mentioned method from the fact that klninase II which destroys bradykinin is thought to be identical with angiotensin I converting enzyme. The results are shown in Table 1. The test compounds inhibited the contractile response to angiotensin I but not to angiotensin II inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme , while they enhanced the response to bradykinin inhibition of kininase II . PHARbiACOLOGICJL TEST 2 The activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically according to the method of D.W.Cushman and H.S. Cheung Biol. Pharmacol., 20, 1637 1971 .That is, the absorbance of hippuric acid was measured, which was liberated by incubating hippuryl L histidyl L leucine HHL as substrate in the presence of angiotensin I converting enzyme.Angiotensin I converting enzyme was extracted from rabbit lung by the method of D. Manjusri and R.L. Soffer J. Biol. Chem., 250, 6762 1975 .Measurement of inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme The reaction mixture is as follows 100my phosphate buffer pH 8.3 300mM sodium chloride 5mM HHL 8 10 4 10 M enzyme inhibitor 0 10mU enzyme 0.25ml of the above mixture was incubated at 370C for 30 minutes and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.25ml of 1 N hydrochloric acid. To this solution, 1.5ml of ethyl acetate was added in order to extract hippuric acid. l.Oml of ethyl acetate layer was collected and evaporated to dryness and the residue obtained was dissolved in 1.0ml of water and the absorbance thereof was measured at 228nm. The inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme was calculated by the following formula Inhibitory percentage x 100 A A Absorbance of the reacrion solution without the compound B Absorbance of the reaction solution in the presence of the compoundMolar concentration of the compound producing 502 inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme IC50 The inhibitory activity of the compound was measured at the concentration of 1 x 10 4 to 1 x 10 8M and IC50 at each concentration was calculated. The results are shown in Table 2.
