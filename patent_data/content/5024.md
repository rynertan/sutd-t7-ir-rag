# Sheet materials.

## Abstract
A stilt material 21 for preventing accidental rupture of microcapsules 20 coated on to sheet 23 material comprises agglomerates in which mineral particles, e.g. of kaolin, are dispersed in a matrix of coacervated polymer s , e.g. gelatin and gum arabic. The agglomerates are produced by forming a dispersion of mineral particles in a solution of coacervatable polymer s and then bringing about coacervation to cause the polymer s to deposit as a matrix about the dispersed mineral particles. The stilt material agglomerates 21 may be used as a constituent of microcapsule coatings 20 on pressure sensitive copying sheets.
