# Resistive loop angular filter.

## Abstract
An angular filter 50 for electromagnetic radiation is formed of a set of elements supported on a dielectric substrate. The elements are rods 100 or loops which are electrically conducting and include resistance for dissipating energy of the radiation. Each rod 100 is formed as a linear element parallel to the axis 300 of propagation of the radiation. Each loop element is formed as a closed loop in a plane normal to an axis of propagation of the radiation. This minimizes interaction with a transverse magnetic field of the radiation at zero angle of incidence to the filter, the interaction and consequent attenuation increasing with increasing angle of incidence. Thereby, spurious sidelobes of a radiation pattern associated with a radar or other antenna can be reduced by the filter in favor of the main lobe along the antenna axis. The loop elements may also be formed by a set of members spaced apart to introduce capacitance for resonating with inherent inductance of the members, there by to enhance the filter attenuation.
