# Method for preparing silver halide photographic emulsion.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for preparing a silver halide photographic emulsion by use of an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution in a double jet manner, characterized in that the meth od comprises the step of keeping essentially constant the sol ubility of the silver halide in a silver halide photographic emul sion during the crystalization of said silver halide after 10 mole of said total silver halide crystals have been precipitated, and or during a physical ripening process. The method according to the present invention can pro vide a monodispersed silver halide photographic emulsion which has a high sensitivity, i.e., which comprises silver halide having a relatively large crystal size.
