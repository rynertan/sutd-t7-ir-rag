# Polyurethane foam and method of preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A semi flexible shock absorbing polyurethane foam is a reaction product of a a polyether triol having an hydroxyl number of from 25 to 115 b a bulky modifying compound soluble in said triol a and having a single reactive hydrogen site, selected from i naphthalene substituted with OH, COOH, NH₂, or SH ii anthracene substituted with OH, COOH, NH₂, or SH iii phenanthrene substituted with OH, COOH, NH₂, or SH iv hydroabietyl alcohol and v dehydroabietyl amine c an aromatic polyisocyanate reactive with a to form a polyurethane d at least one blowing agent selected from water and low boiling volatile organic liquid polyurethane blowing agents e at least one substance which is a polyurethane chain extender or crosslinking agent having at least two reactive hydrogens and f a catalyst for polyurethane forming reaction be tween the said triol a and the said polyisocyanate c . A method of making the foam is described.
