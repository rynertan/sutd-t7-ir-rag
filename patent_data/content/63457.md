# Electrical contact and electrical connector assembly.

## Abstract
An improved insulation piercing contact 20 is disclosed for use in an electrical connector assembly 10 . The contact 20 is made of a sheet metal stamping, which includes a top portion 60 for making electrical contact with a first conduc tor, and a bottom portion 62 which includes at least two tines 64, 66, 68 . Each tine is bevelled and has a bottom edge 90 which pierces the insulation of a second conductor 36 and makes contact. The tines 64, 66, 68 may project away from one of the planar surfaces 50 of the contact. An electrical connector assembly 10 employing such a contact is also disclosed.
