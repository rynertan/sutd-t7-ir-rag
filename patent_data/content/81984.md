## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD OF REDUCTION OF DISCOLORATION OF AROMATIC PEROXIDE INITIATED POLYOL ALLYL CARBONATE POLYMERS AND POLYMERS PRODUCED THEREBY. The present invention relates to a method of reduction of discoloration of aromatic peroxide initiated polyol allyl carbonate polymers and polymers produced thereby. Aromatic peroxide initiated polyol allyl carbonate polymers have superior physical properties, e.g., impact strength, relative to dialkyl peroxy dicarbonate initiated polyol allyl carbonate polymers. Moreover, the commerically available aromatic peroxide S generally have a higher initiation tempera ture, i.e. a longer half life, than dialkyl peroxy dicarbonate initiators, thereby being more convenient to ship or store. However, aromatic peroxide initiators are reported to impart a yellow discoloration to the polymerizate. Moreover, aromatic peroxide initiated polyol allyl carbonate polymerizates are reported to be more susceptible to ultraviolet radiation induced yellowing than are dialkyl peroxy dicarbonate initiated polyol allyl carbonate polymers. According to the invention herein contemplated the yellow coloration of the polyol allyl carbonate polymerizate, including both initial discoloration and ultraviolet induced yellowing, is reduced by the use of low levels of the initiator, the presence of a 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenone ultraviolet absorber, and preferably the destruction of the initiator. In one exemplification of the invention herein contemplated, there is provided a solid, polymeric composition of a polyol allyl carbone , fragments of aroruaUic peroxide initiator, and an effective amount of a 2 hydroxy 4 allzoxy benzophenone. By fragments of aromatic peroxide initiator is meant the reacted initiator present in the termination product of rowing polyir, i.e. the coupling reaction product or the disproportionation reaction product of two active centers. By an effective amount of a 2 hYdroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenonett is meant an amount sufficient to reduce yellowing and discoloration, e.g., ultraviolet radiation induced yellowing and discoloration, below the levels thereof encountered in the polymerizate in the absence of 2 hydroxy 4alkoxy benzophenone. In one embodiment of the invention there is provided a liquid composition of monomeric polyol allyl carbonate , and aromatic peroxide initiator, where the initial concentration of aromatic peroxide initiator is sufficient to provide a solid polymerizate and up to about 0.01 mole of aromatic peroxide initiator per equivalent of allyl carbonate group, and in a preferred exemplification, the monomeric composition further includes an effective amount of 2 hydroxy 4alkoxy benzophenone. The composition is polymerized to yield a solid polymerizate. According to a preferred exemplification, the solid polymerizate is further cured for a time sufficient under kinetic consideraticns to substantially destroy the residual, unreacted aromatic peroxide initiator.That is, after polymerization the solid polymerizate is heated for a time and tempera ture theoretically sufficient, assuninr first order honcl ytic deconposition in the polymerizing system with the same coefficient as in a monomer system., to inc or orate from about 83 percent to about 99.99 percert or more of the residual, unreacted aromatic polymerization initiator in the polymer, e.g., by initiation, chain troth, and chain termination. Most commonly the aromatic peroxide initiators herein conteinDlated have the empirical formula represented byEMI3.1 where X is chosen from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 to C12 alkoxy groups, chlorine, and bromine. Most commonly X is hydrogen, a C1 to C4 alkoxy group, or bromine. Exemplary aromatic peroxide initiators include benzoyl peroxide, bis p methoxy benzoyl peroxide, bis p ethoxy benzoyl peroxide, bis p propoxy benzoyl peroxide, bis p isopropoxy benzoyl peroxide, bis p butoxy benzoyl peroxide, and bis p chloro benzoyl peroxide. Especially preferred is benzoyl peroxide. In order to reduce initial discoloration and ultraviolet induced yellowing, the amount of aromatic peroxide initiator should be the minimum that will provide the desired cure as evidenced by, e.g., Barcol hardness or Izod Impact Strength. The minimum amount of aromatic peroxide initiator needed to provide the described degree of cure may be found by routine experimentation. For example, in order to impart a fifteen second Barcol hardness above about 20 to diethylene glycol bis allyl car bonate , from about 0.05 mole to about 0.01 mole of benzoyl perox ide is required per equivalent of allyl carbonate functionality. Amounts above about 0.01 mole of initiator per mole of allyl carbonate functionality provide either excessive amounts of unreacted peroxide in the polymerizate without significantly enhancing the physical properties of the resulting polymerizate or excessive amounts of initial yellow discoloration. Moreover, it has been found that Barcol hardness values as high as about 25 may be obtained without undesirable initial yellow discoloration, at the initiator concentrations contemplated herein, by the extended cure contemplated herein. Generally, for aromatic peroxide poly merization initiators having a half life of 0.1 to 1.0 hour at 1000C, the concentration thereof should be about 0.005 mole per equivalent of allyl carbonate to about 0.01 mole per equivalent of allyl carbonate. The tendency of the aromatic peroxide to introduce yellowing or discoloration into the polymerizate may be further reduced without deterioration of the polymerizate hardness by continuing the cure, i.e., heating, beyond that previously thought necessary to attain the desired degrees of hardness. For example, when the cure cycle shown in Table I below is followed, the polymerizate may be maintained at 100 degrees for an additional 1 to 4 hours or more. The post cure is generally carried out above about 100 degrees C, but below the temperatures at which thermal degradation provides undesirable yellowness, e.g., 125 degreesCentigrade, and preferably for a time sufficient to attain either substantially constant or maximum Barcol hardness.Although not wishing to be bound thereby, the additional 1 to 4 hours of post cure is believed to decompose, e.g., by initiation and chain termination, from 83 percent to 99.9 percent of the aromatic peroxide initiator remaining unreacted at the end of the normal 18 hour cure cycle. Moreover, the additional 1 to 4 hours of cure increases the Barcol Hardness by about 5 to 8 units, while avoiding the undesirable amounts of yellowness associated with the higher peroxide initiator concentrations previously believed to be required therefor.

Contemplated herein in a preferred exemplificaiton is the presence of a 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenone ultraviolet absorber having high absorbence in the range of 250 nanometers to 450 nanometers. The amount of 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenone ultraviolet energy absorber is an amount sufficient to reduce the ultraviolet radiation induced yellowing of the polyol allyl carbonate polymerizate, but low enough to avoid imparting a color thereto. Generally the amount of 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenone is from about 0.005 moles of the benzophenone to about 0.15 moles of the benzophenone per peroxy bond in the organic peroxide initiator. Higher amounts of benzophenone may impart coloration to the polymerizate, while lower amounts, i.e., less than about 0.01 moles of benzophenone per peroxy bond, do not appear to reduce ultraviolet radiation induced yellowing. An especially preferred range of 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenone, for example 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone, with an aromatic peroxide initiator, for example benzoyl peroxide, in a polyol allyl carbonate , for example diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , is from about 0.01 mole of 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone per mole of benzoyl peroxide to about 0.15 mole of 2hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone per mole of benzoyl peroxide, with a range of about 0.02 to 0.08 moles of 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone per mole of benzoyl peroxide being especially preferred. The 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenones herein contemplated have the empirical formula represented byEMI5.1 where R4 is chosen from the group consisting of C1 to C12 alkyls and C2 to C12 hydroxy alkyls, R5 is chcsen from the group consisting of H and CH3, R21 is chosen from the group consisting of H and OH, R41 is chosen from the group consisting of H, C1 to C12 alkoxy groups, and C2 to C12 alkoxy hydroxide groups, and R51 is chosen from the group consisting of H and CH3. In commercially available 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenones, R4 is commonly CH3, C4H9, C7H15, C8H17, C12H25, or C2H40H, R5 is H, R21 is H, R41 is H, and R is H. Exemplary are 51 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone sold under the names AmericanCyanamid Company CYASORBs UV 9 , and GAF UVINULX M 40 , 2hydroxy 4 heptyloxy benzophenone, sold under the name UNITSAT 247 by Ward, Blenkinsop Co., Ltd., 2 hydroxy 4 octyloxy benzophenone sold under the names American Cyanamid Co. CYASORBe W UV 531 and Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Co.PICCOTM UV 299 , 2 hydroxy4 dodecyloxy benzophenone sold under the name Eastman InhibitorDOBP and DuPont RYLEXTN D , and 2 hydroxy 4 2 hydroxy ethoxy benzophenone sold under the name Eastman Inhibitor HHBP. Other commercial 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy benzophenones are 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy 5 methylbenzophenone, 2,2 dihydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone, 2,2 dihydroxy 4 butoxy benzophenone, 2,2 dihydroxy 4 octyloxy benzophenone, and 2,2 dihydroxy 4,4 dimethoxy benzophenone. In a particularly preferred exemplification the 2 hydroxy4 alkoxy benzophenone has the empirical formula represented byEMI6.1 where R4 is a C1 to 012 alkyl or a C2 to C12 alkyl hydroxy. Examples of polyol allyl carbonates which may be polymerised in accordance with this invention are mono functional allyl carbonates, diol bis allyl carbonates , triol tris allyl carbonates , tetra kis allyl carbonates , and higher polyol allyl carbonates . Diol bis allyl carbonate monomers which may be polymerized by the method of this invention are normally liquid allyl carbonates, and, most commonly, are aliphatic diol bis allyl carbonates i.e., glycol bis allyl carbonate compounds, in which the allyl groups may be substituted at the 2 position with a halogen, notably chlorine or bromine, or a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl group, generally a methyl or ethyl group, and the glycol group may be an alkylene, alkylene ether, alkylene polyether, alkylene carbonate, or alkylene polyether group having from 2 to 10 carbons and oxygens. These diol bis allyl carbonate monomers are represented by the formula EMI7.1 where R7 and Rg are allyl or substituted allyl groups, and R8 is as defined below.R7 and Rg are independently represented by the formula EMI7.2 where R10 may be hydrogen, halogen, or a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl group.Specific examples of R7 and Rg are allyl, 2 chloroallyl 2 bromoallyl, 2 iodoallyl, 2 fluoroallyl, 2 methallyl, 2 ethylallyl, 2 isopropylallyl, 2 n propylallyl, and 2 n butylallyl groups. Most commonly, R7 and Rg are allyl groups, H2C CH CH2 . Such compounds and methods for making them are disclosed in U. S. Patents 2,370,567 and 2,403,113. Specific examples of R8 are alkylene groups e.g. ethylene, trimethylene, methylethylene, tetramethylene, ethylethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene, 2 methylhexamethylene, octamethylene, and decamethylene groups, alkylene ether groups e.g., CH2 O CH2 , CH2CH2 0 CH2CH2 CH2 0 CH2 CH2 , and CH2CH2CH2 0 CH2CH2CH2 , alkylene polyether groups e.g. CH2CH2 0 CH2CH2 0 CH2CH2 0 CH2CH20 CH2CH2 , and CH2 0 CH2groups, alkylene carbonate groups e.g., CH2CH2 0 CO 0 CH2CHz and alkylene carbonate groups e.g., CH2CH2 0 CX2CH2 0 CO 0 CH2CH2 OCH2CH2 groups. Specific examples of diol bis allyl carbonate monomers useful in carrying out the method herein contemplated are ethylene glycol bis 2 chloroallyl carbonate , diethylene glycol bis 2methallyl carbonate , triethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , propylene glycol bis 2 ethylallyl carbonate , 1,3 propanediol bis allyl carbonate , 1,3 butanediol bis allyl carbonate , 1,4 butanediol bis 2 bromoallyl carbonate , dipropylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , trimethylene glycol bis 2 ethylallyl carbonate , and pentamethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate . Commercially important diol bis allyl carbonate monomers which may be polymerized by the method herein contemplated are EMI8.1 Triol tris allyl carbonates which may be polymerized by the method of this invention, either homopolymerized or copolymerized, e.g., with diol bis allyl carbonates , are represented by the formulaEMI8.2 with n equal to 3 where R11 is an organic moiety chosen from the group consisting of moieties derived from polyols and extended polyols, most frequently a triol or extended triol where the hydroxyl groups of the precursor polyol R11 OH n are non vicinal While the functionality indicated above is tris function ality, it is to be understood that in higher polyols n is greater than 2, e.g.., above about 2.2, representing a mixture of diols and higher polyols, to about 8 representing a derivative of trimeric pentaerythritol. By non vicinal 1 it is meant that the hydroxyl groups are not on adjacent carbons. Specific triol precursors useful in preparing the tris allyl carbonate materials useful in this invention are triols with primary or secondary hydroxyl groups. Triols having primary hydroxyl groups are preferred pre cursors. One such class of triols are l,l,l trimethylol alkanes. Also useful are extended trimethylol alkyl tris allyl carbonate monomers e.g. , lactone extended trimethylol alkanes and alkyl oxide extended trimethylol alkanes. By an extended triol is meant the reaction product having terminal hydroxyl groups of the trios and a suitable reactant, e.g., an alkyl oxide or a lac tone. Typical lactone extended trimethylol alkanes are caprolactone extended trimethylol methane, caprolactone extended trimethylol ethane, caprolactone extended trimethylol propane, and caprolactone extended trimethylol butane.Typical alkyl oxide extended triols are ethylene oxide extended tri methylol methane, ethylene oxide extended trimethylol ethane, ethylene oxide extended trimethylol propane, ethylene oxide extended trimethylol butane, propylene oxide extended trimethylol methane, propylene oxide extended trimethylol methane, propylene oxide extended trimethylol ethane, propylene oxide extended trimethylol butane. The preferred polyols meeting these requirements have the general formula R11 OH n where n is greater than 2 up to about 8 and generally is about 3. R11 can be EMI10.1 where RA is H, OH3, CH2CH3, CH2CH2CH3, or CH2CH2CH3, and 11, 12 and 13 are each integers from 0 to 5 and the sum of 11 12 13 is 2 or more and generally from 2 to 8, although values as high as 15 are possible. The value of m depends on the lactone utilized to extend the polyol and is generally4 4 or 5. The chain extending lactone may be for example a delta lactone having the formulaEMI10.2 which can be substituted with hydrogen, metal groups, or ethyl groups. According to a still further exemplification, the chain extending lactone group can be an epsilon lactone having the formula EMI10.3 where R12 is hydrogen, a methyl group, or an ethyl group and whereR12 can be on any of the carbons other than the carbonyl carbon.One exemplary triol is Union Carbide Corporation NIA.Ya PGP 0301 brand epsilon caprolactone extended trimethylol propane. According to a still further exemplification, R11 can beEMI11.1 where RA is as defined previously, 11, 12 and 13 are integers from 0 to 5 and the sum of 11 12 13 is 2 or more and generally from about 2 to 8, although values as high as about 15 are possible, andX is H or CH3. The chain extenders may be ethylene oxide groups as exemplified by Upjon ISONOLs 93 ethylene oxide extended trimethylol propane. Alternatively, the extenders may be propylene oxide groups as in BASF Wyandotte PLURACOL TP brand propoxylated trimethylol propane. According to a still further exemplification, R1l 0H 3 may be an extended glycerol, for example, ethylene oxide extended glycerol having the general formula EMI11.2 or propylene oxide extended glycerol having the formula EMI11.3 or a lactone extended glycerol having the formula EMI12.1 where m and 11, 12, and 13 are as defined above. Typical propoxy lated glycerines are DOW VORANOL 2025 brand propoxylated glycerine having a molecular weight of about 260 grams per gram mole, DOW VORANOL 2070 brand propoxylated glycerine having a molecular weight of about 700 grams per gram mole, and BASF Wyandotte PLURACOL GP730 brand propoxylated glycerine having a molecular weight of about 730 grams per gram mole.
