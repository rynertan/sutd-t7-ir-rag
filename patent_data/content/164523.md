# Tires and wheels from low heat buildup polyurethane compositions.

## Abstract
A prepolymer curable with a hydroxyl or amine func tional curative to form a polyurethane elastomer composition having low heat buildup characteristics is disclosed. Specif ically, the polyurethane prepolymer has terminally reactive isocyanate groups and is prepared by reaction of polymeric diol with a stoichiometric excess of a mixture of the 2,6 and 2,4 isomers of tolylene diisocyanate, said mixture containing from about 50 to about 90 wt of the 2,6 isomer. The invention also relates to a polyurethane elastomer composition comprising the aforementioned prepolymer and a curingly effective amount of a curative selected from the group consisting of aromatic diamines, hydroxy functional compounds, and mixtures thereof, and optionally, from about 0.01 to 1 part of catalyst per hundred parts of prepo lymer. Also disclosed are articles of manufacture produced from the above composition, as well as compositions wherein the mixture contains 40 to 100 wt of the 2,6 isomer.
