## Abstract
A pneumatic dental drill handpiece has a light bulb 40 fastened in its head, so directed that it illuminates the tip of the burr 32 . An electric cell 2 is positioned in a semicylin drical chamber 15 located in the rear part 10 of the handpiece casing the chamber is eccentric to the axis of the casing and is accessible through an opening therein, this opening being closed by a thin sleeve 9 slidable on the rear part. Ducts for admission of air 13 and water 12 extend through a channel 17 in the portion of the casing opposite the opening. Electric contact between the front pole of the cell 2 and one terminal of the bulb 40 is made by a conductor wire 21 passing through the hollow front part 20 , and between the rear pole of the cell and the second terminal of the bulb through the anodized aluminium parts 10 and 20 of the casing. The aluminium parts are conductively connected through non anodized contacting surfaces.
