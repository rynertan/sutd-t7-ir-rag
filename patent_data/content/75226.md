## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A roll formed and drawn sheet metal coupling with sealing gasket, characterized in that it comprises an outer enclosing body 1 formed from deep drawn sheet metal and a threaded inner tube 6 made rigid with said outer body 1 by force fitting a flanged zone 8 thereof into said outer body, between said flanged zone 8 and said outer body 1 there being interposed a resilient or rubber like sealing ring or gasket 9 . 2. A coupling according to Claim 1, characterized in that said outer enclosing body 1 has a hexagonal intermediate zone 2 , a wide outer abutment flange formation 3 , and an annular top inner flange 5 . 3. A coupling according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that said tube 6 has a hexagonal outer flange formation 8 adapted to interfere by forcefitting in the inside of said hexagonal intermediate zone 2 of said outer body 1 , in such a way as to provide a firm connection. 4. A coupling according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that between said annular inner flange 5 of the outer body 1 and said tube 6 hexagonal flange formation 8 , there is interposed said resilient or rubber like ring 9 , said rubberlike ring 9 being squeezed and providing a seal between said two parts upon assembling the coupling. 5. A coupling according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that said tube 6 has a zone thereof 7 roll formed to create a thread for threaded connection to system piping. 6. A coupling according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that said rubber like ring 9 protrudes internally to interfere with a pipe being threaded therein and create a seal therewith. 7. A coupling according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that an additional sealing ring 12 is inserted between said wide outer flange 3 and the body 4 of a tank or pump, prior to welding said wide outer flange to said tank or pump body 4 wherewith it is to be associated. 8. A coupling according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that all of the metal parts which make up said coupling are manufactured by die cutting, drawing, and roll forming from sheet metal. 9. A roll formed and drawn sheet metal coupling with sealing gasket, as herein claimed, described, and illustrated for the objects specified.

## Description
This invention relates to a roll formed and drawn sheet metal coupling with sealing gasket. It is a known fact that outlet and inlet fittings for pumps or tanks comprise threaded unions or couplings, which are variously constructed to enable pipe connections.These known fittings are however structurally rather complex and require a lot of specialized labour both during the making and in the assembling thereof. Accordingly the task of this invention is to provide a sheet metal coupling through simple and low cost manufacturing and assembling procedures. Within this task it is an object of the invention to provide a coupling, which can be sealed hydraulically without resorting to the welding of metal parts. Another object of this invention is to provide a coupling, which incorporates a means of sealing it to a pipe threaded thereinto. According to one aspect of the invention the above task and objects as well as yet other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a rollformed and drawn sheet metal coupling with sealing gasket, characterized in that it comprises an outer enclosing body formed from deep drawn sheet metal and a threaded inner tube made rigid with said outer body by force fitting a flanged zone thereof into said outer body, between said flanged zone and said outer body there being interposed a resilient or rubber like sealing ring or gasket. The invention features will be more clearly understood by making reference to the detailed description which follows of a preferred embodiment thereof, as shown in the accompanying illustrative drawing, where Figure 1 is a top plan view of this coupling and Figure 2 shows an axial section view taken along the line Il Il of Figure 1. With reference to the cited drawing figures, the coupling according to this invention comprises an enclosing outer body 1 formed by deep drawing from sheet metal preferably, stainless steel which is configured to have a hexagonal cross section zone 2, a wide outer abutment flange 3 adapted for welding to a pump body or housing of another kind , and a top inner flange 5 obtained by pinching the material. In the inside of the body 1 there is provided a tube member 6, rolled on the outer surface of a portion 7 thereof, whereby a thread is obtained into which the termination of the pipe to be coupled will be threaded, which tube member 6 has at the top a hexagonal flange formation 8, which flange, by interfering with the inside walls of the hexagonal zone 2, makes the tube 6 rigid with the outer body 1. During the force fitting operation, a ring or gasket 9 of a rubber like or resilient material is also interposed which is blocked between the inner flange 5 and hexagonal flange formation 8, to provide a seal therebetween and protrude internally such as to interfere and seaiinglyengage with the pipe being threaded into the coupling. At its bottom portion, the tube 6 has a necked in area 10 which creates an outer shoulder, on which a diaphragm 11 is brought to bear which allows the insertion of an additional sealing ring 12 prior to welding the coupling to the pump or tank body 4. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that all the component parts of the coupling are manufactured by die cutting and drawing sheet metal without any further finishing process. On assembling, the seals are accomplished, rather than by seam welding the various parts, by merely inserting sealing rings in specially provided seats. Even during the later threading of a pipe into the coupling, no intermediate elements need be provided because a gasket which interferes with the pipe outer wall has been incorporated. Hence, it will be apparent that the invention does achieve all its objects. Of course, the materials and dimensions may be any selected ones to meet individual requirements.
