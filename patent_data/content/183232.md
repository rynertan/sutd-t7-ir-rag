# Semiconductor integrated circuit device with built in memories.

## Abstract
A data processing LSI constructing a microcomputer has an EPROM 2 for changing a program. The EPROM can be accessed directly through the external terminals of the data processing LSI. The EPROM is statically operated when it is written with data by direct access. However, the statically operated EPROM consumes relatively high power. This power consumption by the EPROM is reduced by dynamical ly operating its read circuit 25 , address decoder 22 and so on. For example, the read circuit is constructed of a sense amplifier SA and a latch circuit 34 , and the sense amplifier SA has its operation interrupted after the latch circuit 34 has latched the read data. The address decoder 22 is composed of a load MOSFET Q
