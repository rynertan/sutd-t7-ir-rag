# Method of producing an orifice plate.

## Abstract
A method of producing an orifice plate 10 for use in an ink jet printing system and an orifice plate produced by such method. The method comprises forming a pattern of electri cally insulated areas 16 on that surface of a substrate 14 opposed to a support 12 therefor, electroplating 18 the uninsulated areas of the surface of the substrate 14 opposed to the support, separating the substrate 14 from the support 12 and removing selected areas of the subs trate to produce an orifice plate. The plate is bilaminar suitably with nickel being plated onto copper to form a substantially rigid structure.
