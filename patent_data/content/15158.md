# Control unit for a serial printer.

## Abstract
In a serial printer of the type having a carriage continu ously moved along a printing line and supporting a type member intermittently rotated for selecting the next character being printed, a control unit is provided which performs an algorithm for executing a forecast calculation of the residual time missing in every moment to the type member for posi tioning the character being printed. The same control unit calculates a correspondent speed of the carriage depending on that residual time and on the position reached by the carriage on the printing line. The speed of the carriage is thereby continuously controlled from the preceding to the new printing position for causing the printing of the selected character exactly on the printing position at the maximum speed of the carriage consistent with a good print operation.
