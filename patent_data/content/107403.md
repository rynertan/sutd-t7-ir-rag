# Acrylamide containing emulsion copolymers, their use for thickening and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Copolymers of monomer as follows 1 at least 10 weight percent of one or more of the following monomers methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, acrylic acid, acryloxypropionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, cit raconic acid and or crotonic acid 2 0.5 to 25 weight percent of one or more of the monomers of the formula H₂C CH C O NH R wherein R is alkyl, alkylaryl, and or polycyclic alkyl groups having 8 to 30 carbon atoms 3 optionally one or more of the copolymerizable ethyleni cally unsaturated monomers of the formula H₂C CYZ wherein a Y is H and Z is COOR², C₆H₄H³, CN, Cl, CONH₄, OC O R⁴ or CH CH₂ b Y is C₁ C₄ alkyl and Z is COOR², C₆H₄R⁴, CN, CONH₂, or CH CH or c Y and Z are C1 and R² is C₁ C₈ alkyl or C₂ C₈ hydroxyalkyl or lower alkoxy C₂ C₈ alkyl R³ is H, Cl, Br, or C₁ C₄ alkyl and R⁴ is C₁ C₈ alkyl and 4 zero to 1.0 weight percent of one or more polyethylenically unsaturated monomers, when at least partially neutralised and solubilised by addi tions of alkali are effective thickeners for aqueous systems. Surfactants enhance the thickening pertormance of the partially neutralised copolymers. Typical systems to which this thickening can usefully be applied include paint latices, cosmetics, pigment dispersions, oil well drilling fluids, textile printing pastes. denti frices, hand lotions, liquid detergents and pharmaceuticals.
