## Description
Gel electrophoretic techniques are essential tools for analysing complex mixtures of polypeptides and nucleic acids. Applied to proteins the high resolution of these techniques is also exploited for testing the binding activities of antibodies, lectins and various proteins to specific components of such mixtures. The techniques for such an analysis are called overlay assays. They are preferentially performed on electrophoretograms transferred to immobilizing matrices, such as nitrocellulose or nylon based membranes protein or nucleic acid blots . For proteins, this subject has recently been reviewed by Gershoni and Palade Anal. Biochem. 1983, The methodology of analysing complex mixtures of nucleic acids is described e.g. in Devos et al., J. Mol. Biol., EP A 0,158,746, published October 23, 1985 describes methods of visualizing an agglomerate formed by an acceptor substance and a specific binding agent on an immobilizing matrix or blotting medium by using a colloid metal particle as a marker. According to one method the direct method the specific binding agent is labelled with the marker according to another method the indirect method the marker is linked to a macromolecule that specifically binds said specific binding agent. Thus, the marker, i.e. the colloid metal particle, is always associated to some specific binding agent in this assay. The present invention is concerned with a process for staining proteins and nucleic acids in or on solid supports, characterized in that the stain applied is a suspension of colloidal metal particles and the proteins and nucleic acids are visualized as a coloured signal localized at the binding site of the colloidal metal particles to the proteins and nucleic acids or quantitatively determined at this site following art known spectrophotometric procedures, with the proviso that the colloidal metal particles are not bound to a specific binding agent for the protein or nucleic acid to be stained and detected or determined. The invention described hereafter deals with staining of proteins or nucleic acids in or on all kinds of supports. Nucleic acids in this respect comprise both ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acids. The essential point of the present invention is the use as the stain of colloidal metal particles which are adjusted to an optimal pH and concentration. The term colloidal metal particles used in this connection is meant to include dispersions of particles, preferably sols, consisting of a metal, a metal compound or nuclei coated with a metal or metal compound. Colloidal metal particles can be prepared following art known procedures, such as have been described for preparing suspensions or sols of gold, silver, platinum or iron hydroxide and the like. The invention is based on the surprising finding that optimally concentrated and pH adjusted colloidal metal particles bind with high affinity and selectivity to the proteins and nucleic acids and produce a clearly contrasted colour characteristic for the colloidal metal particles used. Optionally, the signal can be modified and or enhanced by further physical development or by transforming the colloidal metal into a metal ion and subsequently by art known colour identification methods of metal ions. For example, Fe³ ions of colloidal iron hydroxide form stable complexes with for example ferrocyanide salt complexes e.g. K₄Fe CN ₆, potassium ferrocyanide , which complexes are strongly coloured. Examples of colloidal metal particles that will bind to proteins and nucleic acids when adjusted to the optimal pH and concentration are the metals platinum, gold, silver and copper, and the metal compounds, silver iodide, silver bromide, copper hydrous oxide, iron oxide, iron hydroxide or hydrous oxide, aluminium hydroxide or hydrous oxide, chromium hydroxide or hydrous oxide, vanadium oxide, arsenic sulfide, manganese hydroxide, lead sulfide, mercury sulfide, barium sulfate and titanium dioxide. Colloids consisting of nuclei, coated with the above mentioned metals or metal compounds can also be used. The particles have similar properties as the metal or metal compound colloids, but size, density and metal content can be optimally combined. In general, all colloidal metal particles or metal compounds which can be adjusted to the optimal pH for protein binding and which give a colour intensity in protein staining, sufficient to be observed by the naked eye, can be used. Preferably, the sensitivities are equal or superior to those obtained with the metals gold and silver. For the staining of proteins, particularly good results are obtained with gold, silver and iron hydroxide colloids. Colloidal iron hydroxide has proven particularly useful for the staining of nucleic acids. The particle size of the colloidal metal or metal compound particles is preferably comprised between 1 to 100 nm. The appropriate concentration of the colloidal metal particles is one that gives full colour saturation within practical incubation times from a few minutes to one day . It can be obtained by choosing the proper concentrations of the raw materials with which they are prepared, or by dilution or concentration by art known methods. The supports in or on which proteins and nucleic acids can be stained according to the present invention can be of various kinds and comprise, for example, gels, in particular those employed for protein and nucleic acid separation by chromatography, electrophoresis or used as supports for any of the art known immunochemical procedures such as immunodiffusion, radioimmunodiffusion, immuno electrophoresis, counter immuno electrophoresis or immunofixation and immobilizing matrices used as supports for overlay techniques for proteins or nucleic acids e.g. hybridization techniques . Examples of such gels on which the staining method according to the invention can he successfully applied include, for example, agarose and cellulose acetate gels. Immobilizing matrices are meant to include any kind of polymeric material on which proteins or nucleic acids can be immobilized, in particular materials onto which proteins or nucleic acids are transferred from separation media by a process generally referred to as blotting. Examples of such matrices are nitrocellulose, nylon e.g. a polyhexamethylene adipamine , cellulose acetate and various modified cellulose acetates like diazobenzyloxymethyl DBM or diazophenylthioether DPT modified cellulose paper. It is advantageous to wash the supports before the staining procedure. This washing is intended to remove adherent interfering materials like, for example, polyacrylamide gel particles and residual SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate , if SDS PAGE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been used first . In comparison with existing staining techniques, the method according to the invention is distinctly superior, particularly in view of its substantially higher sensitivity. As a result, it can be used to detect proteins and nucleic acids in extremely low amounts, which in many circumstances is a highly desirable objective. As mentioned above, such high sensitivity is essential for the adequate staining of protein blots, but it has great advantages too in connection with the direct visualization of proteins or nucleic acids in or on other supports, in particular gels, like, for example, separation media, e.g. electrophoretograms. In this respect, the invention makes it possible to visualise protein separations of samples with a very low protein content, for example, certain biological liquids like cerebrospinal fluid CSF . CSF contain only very low amounts of protein and with the usual analytical and diagnostic techniques, concentration of the fluid, prior to carrying out electrophoretic protein analysis is needed and hence, relatively large samples are needed. A limited amount only can be obtained from one puncture and because of the trauma to the patient and because of the effort and skill demanded in obtaining good specimens, every measure which will reduce the volume needed for analysis is considered a definite advantage, making the technique, more than at present, available for routing analysis and diagnosis. The fact that preliminary concentration or enrichment of the sample can be avoided is an important improvement, facilitating diagnostic methods applied to various fluids like serum and urine. Consequently, the method according to the invention provides a considerable improvement of the existing techniques for the diagnosis of a number of metabolic disturbances and diseases, such as, for example, the detection of brain tumors by CSF analysis and myeloma by analysing urine samples. Hence, the present invention is one with great utility, particularly in clinical diagnosis. The result of the staining operation can be used for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Qualitative evalulation is usually done by mere visual inspection. Quantitative measurements are usually carried out with spectroscopic techniques such as reflectometry or densitometry. When using a densitometric technique, it may be necessary to make the support first transparant by treatment with appropriate solvents, e.g. xylene. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are not intended to limit the scope thereof. Staining of a concentration range of proteinaceous molecular weight markers transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with colloidal gold particles. Staining of molecular weight markers tranferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with colloidal silver particles. Staining of molecular weight markers transferred to a Zeta probe membrane with colloidal iron hydroxide particles. Staining of molecular weight markers transferred to a zeta probe membrane with colloid gold particles. Staining of molecular weight markers transferred to a Zeta probe membrane with colloidal iron hydroxide particles, followed by hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid and transformation to turnbull s blue with potassium ferrocyanide K₄Fe CN ₆ . Staining of proteins in cellulose acetate membranes Cellogel was stored in 30 methanol and dried before use. The membrane was washed in electrophoresis buffer containing 1.34 g Veronal and 10.3 g Veronal sodium per 1000 ml pH 8.6 . Duplicate gels were stained with either amido black or a colloidal gold stain identical with the one described in Example I. With amido black, the usual protein staining pattern was obtained. In the 1 100 diluted sample, only a weak staining of the albumin band could be detected. With the gold stain, the protein bands stained purplish red. In the 1 100 diluted sample, all the major protein bands were still visible. After drying, the bands turned black. It appeared that the gold stain is at least 50 times more sensitive than amido black. Nucleic acids DNA or RNA are applied directly onto the filters dot blot or can be transferred after separation in agarose gels, using the Southern Southern E., Methods in Enzymology, It has been shown that this staining of nucleic acids, prior to hybridization does not interfere with the subsequent hybridization results.
