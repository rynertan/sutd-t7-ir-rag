# MANUFACTURING MASTIC ASPHALT

## Abstract
In an installation for manufacturing mastic asphalt, bitu men from a hopper 10 is kept warm so that it remains suffi ciently fluid to enable it to be easily handled and is supplied to a primary mixer 16 . Powdered limestone filler from a hopper 14 is heated by means of heaters 18 and is added, together with unheated grit from a hopper 12 , to the mixer 16 , via a weighing hopper 20 . The constituent materials are mixed without further heat input and are then discharged into a sec ondary mixer 24 where further mixing occurs. The mixer 24 incorporates passages for the circulation of a heat exchange medium which contacts the asphalt to cool it to a temperature suitable for moulding. The heat extracted from the asphalt is returned to the heaters 18 and re used for heating the filler for asphalt produced subsequently. Asphalt is discharged from the secondary mixer 24 into a plurality of moulds 52 through a pneumatically actuated gate 34 . The gate 34 is operated by a control system incorporating a micro processor. Each mould 52 is weighed after filling and a signal indicative of the weight of the mould is fed to the micro processor. The time for which the gate 34 is opened is varied by the microprocessor in response to the measured weight of the mould so as to render the weight of the asphalt blocks pro duced as consistent as possible. Consequently, the blocks produced are of substantially uniform size and can be formed, after unmoulding, into a self supporting stack. The filled moulds 52 are conveyed through a cooling tower 50 in which they pass through an array of spray nozzles arranged to spray water onto the moulds 52 so that at least some of the water impinging on the moulds 52 initially forms steam and thereby cools the asphalt. Inside the cooling tower 50 the moulds 52 are conveyed along a vertical zig zag path so as to fit.
