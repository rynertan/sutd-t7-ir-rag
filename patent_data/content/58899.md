# A process and apparatus for electromagnetic casting of multiple strands having individual head control.

## Abstract
A multi strand apparatus and process for casting molten material into at least two ingots C of desired shape. Structure 16, 16 is provided for receiving and electromagnetically forming the molten material into in gots C of desired shape. Each of the receiving and forming structures includes an inductor 16, 16 for applying an electromagnetic force field to the molten material. When the inductor 16, 16 is in operation, it is spaced from the molten material by a gap d extend ing from the surface of the molten material to the op posing surface of the inductor 16, 16 . The improvement comprises a device 40 for distributing a common al ternating current to the inductors 16, 16 to generate the magnetic fields. A device 20 is provided for mini mizing variations in the gaps d during operation of the casting apparatus. A feedback control is operatively as sociated with the minimizing variation device 20 re gulating the distribution device 40 to generate substan tially constant alternating current whereby changes in the force field generated by one of the inductors 16, 16 does not substantially effect the force field generated by another of the inductors 16, 16 .
