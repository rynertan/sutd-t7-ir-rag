## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of the Invention Method of Feeding a Predetermined Amount of powder, Apparatus therefor and Package Ued thereinBackground of the InventionField of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of feeding a predetermined amount of powder, an apparatus therefor and a package used therein. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for precisely feeding a predetermined amount of powder, an apparatus therefor and a package used therein, which is employable preferably in the automatic supply, package and weighing of powder.Description of the Related Art According to the evolution of the automatization of the working in the laboratories and factories, the development of automatic systems of feeding and weighing of powder has become an important subject to attain. That is, there are many kinds of powder which have various types and different physical properties It is, however, very difficult to feed or weigh with precise accuracy the powder and thus there has not yet been established an automatic system therefor. For example, in the field of dyeing technology where more than thousand kinds of dyes are usde, contamination of other dyes in a slight amound adversely, in sometime, fatally affects the resulting dye product. In order to avoid the contamination, some apparatus are put for exclusive use to a certain ktnds of powder materials. As mention above, however, there are too many kinds of powder materials to apply such exclusively used system to all the powder materials in the dye industries. Then, automatic feeding and weighing systems are used exclusively for specific kinds of powder materials. Further, when the exclusively used systems are intended to use for other kinds of powder materials, the systems must be washed and cleaned.Such cleaning is time consuming and troublesome. Moreover, the weighing of powder cannot be conducted automatically with precise accuracy by means of the apparatus of the prior art and therefore such a precise weighing of powder has been conducted manually. In the dyeing factory, the weighing is not conducted for each dye powder but for a mixture containing more than two kins of dye powders. Thus the weighing must be conducted with a great accuracy. The weighing of the dye powder material has been conducted, in general, manually with a container which is top opened. Such a weighing operation involves a problem that the dye powder in the container absorbs moisture, resulting in a difference of concentration in the dye material in the same container. The feeding or weighing of pesAer3 zits a top opened container further makes a dust of powder which adversely affects the resulting product and contaminates the working environment. For this sake, the powder materials have been treated not to make a dust, that is, to ductless powder.These dustless powders, however, present generally a high stickiness and are difficult to feed smoothly with the typical powder feeder, such as a screw type feeder or vibration type feeder, Thus, such a sticky powder material has been handled manually for the accurate weighing. Further, most of dyes are composed of various kinds of dye materials and further contain Glauberw4 salt or salt cake and dispersing agent for adjusting the concentration thereof. When such dye powders are fed by the vibrationtype feeder or other type of feeder, they tend to be classified to groups of powders of the ame physical property due to the difference of the specific density or particle size. Thus, it happens that dye material having a different concentration or composition would be supplied at each feeding or weighing chance. On the other hand, when the powder material is fed by the screw type feeder, they tend to agglomerate due to a high abrasion with the screw surface and the absorption of moisture. Thus, a smooth and uniform feeding becomes difficult, so that the feeding cannot be conducted automatically with accuracy. There have been other problems in the operations of feeding, weighing or packaging of dye materials in the factory. That is, such operations include to drop the powder in a container, so that powder of a low specific density tends to make a dust. Thus, in the factory, the dust must be absorbed by a vacuum system not to contaminate other powder materials. But, such absorption cannot be conducted perfectly and the lose of the dye materials due to the absorption is not negligible, Accordingly the automatic weighing of the packaged powder material has not been fully applied to the dye materials. Further, since the dye material is generally voluminous and the apparent density thereof is low, it is necessary to use a large package to pack it. moreover, in order to prevent the variation of the concentration due to the vibration of the powder during the transport and the absorption of mixture during the stockage, the dye material is usually packed in a compacted state in a double bag of which the inner bag is made of polyethylene. The automatic feeding, weighing and packaging oe powder into an opened bag or container involve many problems.Further, a small sized package for powder has not been developed. The fed or weighed dye material should be added gradually into hot water to resolve completely. If a great amount of dye material is added suddenly into hot watery it tends to agglomerate together and remain parrially unsolved. Thus, the dye material shculd bb eddoT little by little at a constant rate for a long time in order to resolve completely. In the case of preparation of an intermediate of the dye product, the powder material must be sdded at a constant rate to a reactive solution in a closed environment. Further, in the case of synthesizing a dye from powder materials such as powder of sodium carbonate, it is important to feed little by little powder materials to a reactive solution, while adjusting pS of the solution. The above matters concern not only the dye industries but also other technical fields in which powders of nonorganic compounds such as anhydrous sodium sulfate, and powder of organic compounds such as intermediate of dye, dispersing agent and fiber based adhesive are handled. A resolution of these problems is required for advancing the automatization in the laboratory and factory. Summary of the Invention It is therefore an object of the present invention to resolve the above mentioned problems and to provide a method for feeding powder in a constant amount, which enables the automatization of the feeding, weighing and packaging of various kinds of powders.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments of th Inyention As mentioned above, according to the present invention, powder is incorporated into a tubular member and fed in the pseudo agglomerated state from the tubular member. Hy handling the powder in the pseudo agglomerated state in the tubular member, the powder can be isolated from the other kinds of powders, 80 that contamination of the powder with other powder is perfectly prevented. Further, it is not necessary to equip feeding or weighing apparatus or systems for exclusive use. Since the powder is packed in a tubular member or cylinder in the pseudo agglomerated state, it does not make a dust nor absorb moisture. Such characteristics is preferable for maintaining cleanly the working environment in the factrory. Further, the package for powder according to the present invention contains the powder in the pseudo agglomerated state, that is, in the compacted state, and therefore it is small sized with respect to the amount of.the powder contained therein. Moreover, the packed powder does not undergo the classification of particles due to the. variation in the specific density and particle size, etc.during the transportation or handling thereof. Further, the powder presents a certain degree cf stickiness and thereforee it is readily transformed to the pseudo agglomerated state. Thus the powder can be easily made in the agglomerated state, so that the feeding or weighing thereof can be conducted rapd iw ana with precise accuracy. Further, the feeding or weighing operation of powder can be easily automized by means of the powder feeding apparatus according to the present invention. For example, a plurality of the powder feeding apparatus, each of which is composed of a tubular member equipped with a piston therein and containing a powder in the pseudo agglomerated state, are arranged so as to move in series. On the other hand, a weighing site composed of a weighing means and a driving means such as a step motor is disposed along the travelling line of the powder feeding apparatus for conducting the feeding or weighing of the powder with the powder feeding apparatus reached thereat. By controlling with a computer the operation of the weighing means, step motor and the travelling of the powder feeding apparatus, it is easily for the those skilled in the art to automize the feeding or weighing operation of the powder. Now the present invention will be explained by way ofExamples, which should be construed as an illustration of the invention and not to restrict the scope of the invention.Example 1 Now referring to Figs. I to 4, a powder feeding apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained. As shown in Fig. 1, the powder feeding apparatus comprises a tubular member 1 of a cOnstafft section and a piston 2 hermetically and slidably movable in the tubular member 1. The tubular member 1 may present a section of any form such as a rectangular section, but it preferably presents a circular section. The piston 2 is connected to a handle 4 through a piston rod 3. The piston 2 may be moved manually or driven by an appropriate means such As a step motor not shown in the drawings . Powder P is contained in the tubular member 1. Tn this example, the powder P has been compacted by advancing the piston 2 to present a pseudo agglomerated state. The pseudo agglomerated state of powder can be obtained by mounting a cap 5 on the top opening of the tubular member 1 and pressing the powder P against the cap 5 by the piston 2,Otherwise, powder may be charge into the tubular member 1 in the pseudo agglomerated state The cap 5 is then removed from the tubular member 1 to expose a cutting means 6 which is mounted on the top portion of the tubular member 1. The cutting means 6 in the example shown in Figs. 1 and 2 comprises a net which is extended across the top opening of the tubular member. Then, as shown in Fig. 2, the piston 2 is forced to move in the direction F to extrude the compacted powder P out of the tubular member 1, The pseudo agglomerated powderP is forced to move through the mesh of the net 6 and cut off to the powdery state. The thus cut off powder is dropped into a container 7 on a weighing means 8. Thus, it is possible to feed a predetermined amount of powder by advancing the piston 2 in accordance with the weight measured by the weighing means 8. As readily understood, since the powder does not move on an inclined plane during the feeding thereof, the powder does not undergo the classification of particles due to the difference in the particle size or specific density, etc,Further, it is possible to feed a very small amount of powder by adjusting minutely the advancement of the piston 2. Now referring to Figs. 3 and 4, it will be explained how to incorporate the powder P in the tubular member 1. Fig. 3 shows how to charge the tubular member with the powder P from a bottle 9. As shown in Fig. 3, first, the top portion of the tubular member 1 is inserted into the powder P contained in the bottle 9. At this stage, the piston 2 is in the fully advanced position. That is, it is positioned near the top portion of the tubular member 1. Then, the piston 2 is retracted, that is, the piston is moved gradually in the direction F to thereby depressurize the inside of the tubular member 1 and thus absorb the powder P therein.Then, the powder cutting means 6 and the cap 5 are mounted on the top portion af the tubular member and then it may be transferred to the feeding site. Fig, 4 shows another way how to charge the tubular member 1 with the powder P. n Tig. 4, the tubular member 1 has been charged with the powder, for example, by the method shown in Fig. 3, and then the powder has been pressed against the cap 5 by means of the piston 2 to form a pseudo agglomerated body P of powder. Then, the cap 5 is removed from the tubular member 1 which is then connected to another tubular member 1 similar thereto. The connection is preferably effected by threading these tubular member with each other. As shown in Fig. 4, the pistons 2 and 2 are moved to the direction F with respect to the tubular members 1 and 1 . That is, the pseudo agglomerated powder P in the tubular member 1 is forced to move therefrom and absorbed into the tubular member 1 . After the compacted powder P is completely transferred to the tubular member 1 , the tubular members 1 and 1 are detached from each other. Then, the cutting means 6 may be mounted on the top portion of the tubular member I , with which the feeding can be conducted as shown in Fig. 2. Example 2 Referring to Figs. 5 to 7, the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. Fig. 5 shows a powder feeding apparatus 11 attached to a bottle g containing powder P therein. As shown in Fig. 5, the powder feeding apparatus 11 comprises a connecting member 12 threaded on the top portion of the bottle 9, a body 13 formed integrally with the connecting member 12, a partition member 14 attached in the top horizontal portion of the body 13 t and a piston member 1S movable coaxially in the partition member 14. As explained hereinafter, the body 13 presents at the top portion thereof b semi cylindrical shell. Further, the body 13 has two holes respectively at the both side of the top portion thereof. The partition means 14 and the piston means 15 are inserted through one of these holes into the top portion of the body 13 while a cutting means 16 is mounted on the other hole. Further, a cap 15 is countable on the cutting means 16 to close the hole. Referring Fig. 6, each member of the powder feeding apparatus shown in Fig. 5 will be explained in more detail. As shown in Fig. 6 a , the piston means 15 contains a piston 21 made of an elastic material such as rubber, a piston rod 22 connected at one end thereof with the piston 21, and a grip 23 connected to the other end of the piston rod 22. The piston rod 22 may be made from a plastic material such as Teflon integrally with the grip 23. As shown in Fig. 6 b , the partition member 14 is generally of an elongated form, of which the both end portions 24 and 25 are of a hollow cylindrical form and the center portion 26 presents a semi cylindrical shell. The piston means 15 is inserted axially in the partition member 14 and slidable in the axial direction. The partion member 14 may be inserted into the holes of the top horizontal portion of the body 13 and supported thereby in a horizontal position, As mentioned below, the partition member 54 is rotatable about its axis in the top horizontal portion of the body 13. Fig. 6 c shows the connecting member 12 and the hollow body 13 of the powder feeding apparatus. As shown inFig. 6 c , the vertical section of the body 13 is generally of a trapezoidal form. The top horizontal portion 23 is opened at the both sides and is generally of the form of a semI cylindrical shell. As mentioned above, the cutting means 16 is mounted across the hole at one side of the top horizontal portion 27, while the partition member i4 is inserted through the hole at the other side together with the piston means 15. In more detail, the partition member 14 is inserted through the hole into the top horizontal portion 27 and is supported rotatably by the two holes. The shape of the Center portion 26 of the partition member 14 is complementary to that of the top horiontal portion 27 of the body 13. The partition member 14 is rotatable and thus it takes two positions that is, the semi cylindrical shell of the partition. member 14 is positioned at the same side as that of the top horizontal portion 27 to receive the powder P thereon, when the powder feeding apparatus is turned to an inverted position. On the other hand, it may be rotated at 1800 to take an opposite position to close a cylindrical space together with the top horizontal shell 27. The piston 21 is hermetically slidable through the thus formed cylindrical space. Fig. 7 shows how to use the powder feeding apparatus shown in rigs. 5 and 6. First, the powder feeding apparatus 1 is connected on the top opening of the bottle 9. At this stage, the semicylindrical shell of the partition member 14 is positioned at the same side as that of the top horizontal portion 27, so that, when the powder feeding apparatus 11 is turned to a vertically inverted position, the powder lies on the partition member 14. Then, the powder feeding apparatus 11 is turned to a vertically inverted position together with the bottle 9 and is maintained in position by a supporting means 28. Next, the partition member 14 is rotated about its axis at 1800 to form a cylindrical space in cooperation with the semi cylindrical shell 27 of the body 13, so that powder is isolated in the form of a cylinder. Next, the piston means 15 is connected at the grip 23 to a driving axis 30 of a step motor 29. The driving axis 30 is constructed so as to advance stepwisely. The piston means 15 is advanced by the step motor 29 to extrude the powder out of the cylindrical space formed by the partition member 14 and the top horizontal portion 27 which is now positioned ac the bottom . The compacted powder is forced to move through the mesh of the cutting means 16 to thereby become a powdery state and dropped into a container 7 on the weighing means 8. The powder feeding apparatus of the present example is preferably employed for feeding powder little by little into a solution in a flues, while agitating the solution iri the laboratories.Example 3 Referring Figs. 8 to 10, the third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. Fig. 8 shows a package 31 for containing powder, which is preferably used in conducting the method of the present invention in the factory. Fig. 9 shows. the package 31 in an expanded form. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the package 31 comprises a hollow cylindrical body 32 made, for example, of a hard paper such as a paperboard, a metal ring 34 fitted on the body 32 at one end thereof for reinforcing it, a first and second caps 33 and 35 attached detachably to the ends of the body 32 for closing the both ends thereof. The metal ring 34 is mounted on the body of paper so as to maintain body 32 in the cylindrical fcrm even if the first cap 33 is removed from the package 31. The second cap 35 is in the form of a cup, the peripherical flange portion is extended in the form of a cylinder of which the diameter is substantially the same as that of the body 32. As mentioned below, the second cap 35 can be used as a piston to extrude the powder out of the package 31 in the factory. Fig. 10 shows how to use the package 31 in conducting the powder feeding method according to the present invention. First, powder is incorporated into the package 31 by an appropriate means so that the powde is contained in the package 31 in the pseudo agglomerated state. The thus obtained package of powder may be transported or saled as it is. During the transportation of the package, the powder does not undergo the classification to particles, since the powder is contalned in the pseudo agglomerated state.Further, the package is small sized with respect to the amount of the powder contained therein. Now, the powder feeding method using the package 31 will be explained with reference to Fig. 10. First, the package of powder 31 is mounted on supporting means 36 so as to maintain the same in position. Then, the first cap 33 is detached and a cutting means 37 such as a metal net is attached to the top portion of the package. On the other hand, a driving means 38 is connected to the second cap 35. In the example shown in Fig. 10, the driving means 38 comprises an abutting member 39 for abutting the second cap 35, a connecting rod 40 threaded on the surface thereof, a converting means 42 for converting rotation into rectilinear movement, and a motor equipped with reducing gears not shown . The abutting member 39 is of a dise form which is fitted in the second cap 35 so that it pushes the second cap 35 through the body 32 of the package. On the other hand, the converting means comprises supporting stand 4 having a hole internally threaded with which the externally threaded portion of the connecting rod 40 Is meshed. Thus, when the connecting rod 40 is rotated, it advances rectilinearly together with the abutting member 39 which, in return, pushes the second cap 35 through the body 31 of the package. The powder ls thus extruded out of the package and cut by the cutting means 37 and drops in the container 7 mounted on the weighing means 8, The advancement of the second cap 35 can be adjusted minutely So that the feeding of powder can be also adjusted at precise accuracy. Such a feeding system enables automatization of powder feeding operation in the factory.Example 4 Referring to Figs. 11 to 15, another embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The powder feeding apparatus according to the present embodiment comprises a container 51 for containing therein powder A. The container 51 is provided at the lowest portion of the side wall thereof with an inlet hold 52 on which a cylinder 53 is mounted. The cylinder 53 is adapted to move in the container. The cylinder 53 is open ended and has a sufficient length to extend across the container 51 as shown in Fig. 12, The cylinder 53 may be of any sectional form, but it is preferable to present a circular section. The cylinder 53 is movable rectilinearly in the forward and backward directions through the hole 52 in the container 51. In the most advanced po.ni4iont the cylinder 53 reaches at an opening or hole 54 on the sidewall of the container at the opposite side. In the most retracted position, the top portion of the cylinder ia j nssltioned near the hole 52. The cylinder 53 may be detachable from the container 51. For facilitating the advance of the cylinder 53 through powder A in the container 51, the top portion of the cylinder 53 may be edged or the cylinder 53 may be advanced while being rotated about its axis. The cylinder 53 is equipped with a portion 55 connected with a piston rod 55a. The piston 55 is hermetically slidable on the inner wall of the cylinder 53. Thus, the piston 55 is moved forwardly to compact the powder in the cylinder to thereby control the degree of the compaction of the powder, or to extrude a predetermined amount of the powder B from the outlet hole s4a. In order to obtain a hermetical contact between the piston 55 and the inner wall of the cylinder 53, the piston 55 is made of an elastic material such as natural or synthetic rubber, functional plastic, etc. The powder feeding apparatus is further equipped with a closing plate 56 at the outlet hole 54. Thus, I the outlet hole 54 is normally closed by the plate 56, and is opened by moving the plate 56 upwardly when the feeding is to be effected. The powder feeding apparatus is further equipped with a knife 51 at a position above the outlet hole 54. The knife 57 is provided with an underolade and it may be dropped to cut the extruded pseudo agglomerated powder. The cutting may be conducted by other means, such as a net extended across the outlet hole 54. The cylinder 53 and the piston 55 may be equipped with air escape holes to facilitate the absorption of powder into the cylinder when it receives a powder. The powder feeding apparatus of this example operates as follows 1 First, the outlet hole 54 is closed with the plate 56 and the cylinder 53 ia maintained at the retracted position, as shown in Fig. 11 Then, powder A ia supplied into the container 51 from an inlet not shown in the drawings. 2 Next, the cylinder 53 is forced to advance in the container 51 to a position close to the outlet hole 54 to thereby receive therein the powder A. This advancement of the cylinder 53 may be made while rotating the same. Thus, the powder received in the cylinder 53 is isolated from the powder A in the container 51. Since the powder is somewhat sticky, the powder received in the cylinder 53 is compacted and may be in the pseudo agglomerated state. When the degree of the compaction of the powder B is insufficient to obtain an appropriate psseudo agglomerated state, the powder may be further compacted by advancing the piston 5i by a distance l as shown in Fig. 15. The degree of the compaction of the powderB is determined in function of the distance L between the top portion 53a of the cylinder 53 and the front face of the piston 55, the amount of powder B received in the cylinder 53 and the distance 1 . If these relationship is determined beforehand, the degree of the compression of the powder 3, that is, the degree of the pseudo agglomeration of the powder B may be readily controlled by adjusting the advancement of the piston 55.For this sake it is convenient to provide on the outer surface of the cylinder 53 a scale indicating the distance nl , 3 When a pseudo agglomerated state of the powder B is obtained, the plate 56 ic moved upwardly to open the outlet hole 54 and the piston 55 is further advanced with a predetermined length to extrude a predetermined length of the pseudo agglomerated powder B out of the cylinder 55, as shown in Fig. 13. Since the powder has an appropriate stickiness, it becomes to the pseudoagglomerated state with a low compression and then the configuration thereof is maintained without easily being broken. 4 The cutter is moved downwardly onto the portion of the pseudo agglomerated powder Bwhich is projected out of the cylinder t3. Due to The caFtlry by the knife 57, the falsely bonded sites of çhe powder B are broken so that the original State of the powder is recovered Thus, the cut off powder drops into a container 7 on a weighing means 8. In the powder feeding apparatus shown in Figs. 11 to 14, the advancement of the piston 55 may be controlled in accordance with the measured weighs of the fed powder to automize the feeding operation. In another way of employment of the powder feeding apparatus, the apparatus is positioned in the state shown in Fig. 12, and then the cylinder 53 is retracted and detached from the container 51. The portion of the compacted powder which is projected from the top portion of the cylinder is then cut off to thereby obtain a powder feeding apparatus similar to that shown in Figs. 1 to 4, That is, a powder cutting means 6 and a cap 5 are mounted on the top portion of the cylinder 53 to transport it, and at the feeding site, the cap 5 is removed from the cylinder 53 and then the feeding operation may be conducted in a way similar to that shown in Fig. 2. Further, the piston rod 55a may be threaded to the piston 55 and the threaded hole may operate as an air escape. Moreover, the piston rod 55a is preferably detachable from the piston and it is detached from t3e piston S5 in the case of the transportation thereof. In the following Examples 5 to 10, t will be explained how to incorporate or charge the powder of the pseu o agglomerated state into a cylinder which is subsequently unable as the tubular member of the powder feeding apparatus shown in Fig. 1.Example 5 Referring to Figs. 16 and 17, a further embodiment of the present invention will be explained in order to show how to charge a cylinder with a powder of the pseudo agglomerated state. As shown in the drawings, the apparatus for incorporating powder into a cylinder comprises a container 51, a cylinder 53 and a piston rod 60. These cylinder 53 and R piston rod 60 are detachably mounted on the container 51 at opposite side to each other. These cylinder 53 and piston rod 60 are movable on the bottom surface of the container 51 in the same rectilinear direction. The apparatus further comprises a partition plate 61 at the inlet hole through which the cylinder 53 is inserted into the container, to thereby close the hole. The partition plate 61 is movable vertically. At the upper position of the partition plate 61r the inle hole is opened as Shown in Fig. 17, while, at the lower position, the inlet hole is closed as shown in Fig. 16. The operation of the apparatus is as follows First, the apparatus stands in the state shown in Fig. 16. Then, the partition plate 6 is moves wardly to open the inlet hole so that the powder A can be transferred from the container S1 into the cylinder 53. Then, the piston rod 60 is forced to advance into the container 51 as shown in Fig, 17, so that the powder is pushed towards the cylinder 53 and pressed to some extent to form the pseudoagglomerated state B of powder. After the front portion of the piston rod 60 reaches at the front portion of the cylinder 53, the piston rod 60 is retracted and then the partition plate 61 is moved downwardly to close the inlet hole.Then, the cylinder 53 is detached from the container 51 to obtain a cylinder 53 equipped with a piston 55, which may be used as a powder feeding apparatus shown in Figs. 1 and 2. That is, the cylinder 53 containing therein the pseudo agglomerated powder B may be used as a package of powder as it is, or may be used as a powder feeder with which a predetermined amount of powder may be fed little by little by advancing the piston 55 and cutting the extruded portion of the pseudo agglomerated powder.Example 6 Another embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 18 and 19 to show how to incorporate the powder of the pseudo agglomerated state into a cylinder. In this example, the container 51 is provided at the bottom thereof with an inlet hole through which the powder A may be transferred out ei the cran ainer size apparatus comprises a cylinder 53 equipped wlt i a piston 55 and piston rod 55a, which is detachably mounted to the inlet hole SO as to receive the powder A therein. The apparatus further comprises a partition plate 61 which AS movable to close the inlet hold or to open the same. The operation of the apparatus io as follows First, the apparatus stands in the state shown inFig. 18. Then, the piston 55 is retracted downwardly to depressurize the inside of the cylinder 53, so that the powder A is absorbed into the cylinder 53. The powder is absorbed in the pseudo agglomerated state since the powder is compacted due to the absorption pressure. Thereafter, the partition plate 61 is moved to shut the inlet hole. If necessary, the piSton is advanced to further compact the powder B to enhence the compaction of the powder in order to ensure the pseudo agglomeration of the powder.Then, the cylinder 53 is detached from the container 51. In this example, the cylinder 53 may include a depressurizing means to depressurize the inside of the cylinder 53. Example 7 A further embodiment of the invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 20 and 21 in order to show how to charge a cylinder with a pseudo agglomerated powder. The apparatus shown in Figs. 20 and 21 is similar to that shown in Figs, 16 sng 17, except that t partition plate 16 shown in Figs. 16 and 17 is not equipped. In this example, the powder is charged into the cylinder 53 by pushing the powder towards the cylinder 53 and concurrently absorbing the same into the cylinder. The operation is conducted as follows First, the piston rod 60 is in the retracted position while the piston 55 is in the advanced position. Then, the piston rod 60 is forced to advance in the container 51 to press the powder A towards the cylinde 53, while the piston 55 is retracted to absorb the powder A into the cylinder 53, as shown in Fig. Zo. These two actions are made simultaneously until the front portion of the piston rod 60 reaches at the inlet hole at which the cylinder 53 is mounted, as shown in Fig. 21. Then, the cylinder 53 is detached from the container 51 to provide a powder feeding apparatus similar to that shown in Fig. 1. The amount of the powder B and the degree of the compaction thereof are determined in function of the advancing length L1 oe the piston rod 60 and the retraction length L2 of the piston 55. Accordingly, the formation of the pseudo agglomerated state of the powder B is smoothly attained. Moreover, it is not necessary to dispose an a r escape hole nor depressurising hole for the apparatus ot, this example. According to the method of the present example, the powder can be packed without soiling the outer surface of the cylinder 53. Moreover, the cylinder 5i J y ne used for automatic feeding or weighing of powder.Example 8 Referring to Fig. 22 to 26, a further embodiment of the present invention will be explained to show another way for incorporating a pseudo agglomerated powder into a cylinder. In this example, a pair of cylinders 53, 531 are mounted to the sidewall of the container 51 near the bottom thereof. These cylinders 53 and 53 are directed to an opposite direction to each other. Each of the cylinders 53 and 53 are equipped with pistons 55, 55 and piston rods 5spa, 55a , As shown in Fig. 22, one of the cylinders 53 and 53 is adapted to advance into the container 51 and the other cylinder 53 is detachably connected to the container. Further, the cylinder 53 is of the same length as the distance between the inlet holes at which the cylinders 53 and 53 are mounted respectively, so that, when the cylinder 53 is advanced completely into the container 51, the cylinder 53 becomes contacted and communicated with the cylinder 53 , The operation of this apparatus is as follows At the first stage, the cylinders 53, 53 are in the retracted position and the front portions of the cylinders 53, S3 and the pistons SS, 55 are positioned respectively near the inlet holes.That is, the piston 55 and 55 are completely advanced into the cylinders. Then 1 the cylinder 53 is forced to advance into th6 container to thereby receive the powder A therein, while the piston 55 tnereof and the cylinder 53 and its piston 55 are maintained in position with respect to the container 51, as shown inFig. 22. During the final stage of the advancement of the cylinder 53, the powder A received in the cylinder 53 cannot escape therefrom and therefore It is slightly compacted to form a pseudo agglomerated state B. When the degree of the compaction is not satisfactory, the piston 55 is advanced slightly to further compact the powder, while the piston 55 is fixed in position. Then the fixation of the piston 55 is released and the piston 55 is forced to advance in the cylinder 53 so that the compacted powder B is moved into the cylinder 53 . When the compacted powder B is completely transferred into the cylinder 53 as shown in Fig. 25, the cylinder 53 ia detached from the container 51. Thus the cylinder 53 contains therein the compacted powder B and is usable for the powder feeding method according to the present invention. Moreover, the outer surface of the thus handled cylinder 53 is maintained clean. Although the container 51 shown in Figs. 22 to 25 is equipped with only one pair of cylinders, it may be equipped with a plurality of pairs of cylinders, which are mounted at positions staggered vertically or horizontally with each other pair. In Fig. 6, the container 51 is equipped with two pairs of cylinders 55, 55 staggered, vertically and thus it exerts operation effectivity twice higher than that of the apparatus shown in Figs. 22 to 25.Example 9 A further embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 27 to 29 to show a still another way for incorporating a pseudo agglomerated powder into a cylinder. In this example, a cylinder means 53 is mounted to the side wall near the bottom of the container 51 so as to advance into the container 51. The cylinder means 53 comprises an inner cylinder 81 equipped therein with a piston 55 and a piston rod 55a connected thereto and an outer cylinder 82 mounted telesscopioally on the inner cylinder 81. At the position shown in Fig 27 and 28 where the inner cylinder 81 Is advanced fully into the outer cylinder 82, the gap between the front portions of the inner and outer cylinders 61 and 82 is hermetically sealed by an annular member 62. The operation of this apparatus is as follows First, the cylinder means 53 is mounted at the inlet hole and is forced to advance in the container 51 in which a large amount of powder A is contained, while the gap between the front portions of the tinner and outer çy lim.ders and 82 is sealed by the annular member 62. The powder A s received in the inner cylinder 81, and when the top portion of the cylinder means 53 reaches and contacts with the opposite side wall of the container SI, the received powderA is compacted to some degree to present a pseudo agglomerated state B. When the compaction of the powder B is Insufficient for the subsequent use, the powder 3 ib further compacted by advancing the piston 55. As shown in Fig. 29, the inn. cylinder 81 is then extracted from the outer cylinder 82 which is maintain n position, thereby obtaining a compacted powder B without soiling the outer surface of the inner cylinder 81. The inner cylinder 81 may be extracted from the container 51 together with the outer cylinder 82 and then itIs further extracted from the outer cylinder 82 to obtain the cylinder 81 containing therein the compacted powder B.Example 10 Referring to Figs. 30 to 32, a further embodiment of the present invention will be explained in order to show a still further way for aharging a cylinder with a pseudoagglomerated powder. The container 51 according to this embodiment comprises three separating tubes 63, 64, 65 which are mounted vertically therein and of which the bottcm open ends are respectively connected tc the outlet roles dsposed at the bottom of the container 51. The container 51 Is further equipped with a partition plate e6 which are movable horizontally to close or open the top holes of the separating tubes 63, 64, 65. On the other hand, three cylinders 53 are mounted detachably on the outlet holes at the bottom of the container 51 to be communicated respectively with the separating tubes 63, 64, 65. Each cylinders 53 is equipped therein with a piston 55 and a piston rod 55a connected thereto. The operation of the apparatus is as follows First, the cylinders 53 are attached on the bottom of the container 51 so that they are communicated respectively with the tubes 63, 64, 65, with the pistons 55 being advanced to the upmost position. Then, the partition plate 66 is moved to open the top opening of the tubes 63, 64, 65, so that the powder A is dropped in the tubes 63, 64, 69. After the separating tubes 63, 64r 65 are filled with the powder A, the partition plate 66 is moved to close the top holes of the tubes 63, 64, 65. Each of the pistons 55 is then retracted gradually to absorb the powder A into the cylinder 53. When the power A is absorbed, it is compacted to become the pseudo agglomerated state B, If the compaction of the powder B is insufficient, the piston 53 ig slightly advanced upwardly to further compact the powder B. Then, the cylinders 53 is detached from the container 51 to thereby obtain three cylinders each containing therein a pseudo agglomerated powder B as shown in Fig. 32, These cylinders 53 can be handled without soiling the outer surface thereof with the powder, The apparatus may be equipped with a pressurizing means for absorbing the powder from the cylinders 63, 64, 65 to the cylinders 53. we conducted an experiment with the apparatus shown inFigs. 30 to 32. First, having mounted the separating tubes 63, 64 t 65 inner diameter 1.4 cm, length 6.3 cm to the container 51 as shown in Fig, 30, a dye dispersing agent was fed to the container to a height of 8 cm and the top portion thereof was maintained horizontally, so that the separating tube 63, 64, 65 were completely e edded in the powder.Then, the partition plate 66 was moved to close the inlet holes of the tubes 63, 64, 65, and then the pistons 55 were gradually retracted downwardly to absorb the powder in the cylinders 53. Thereafter, the cylinders 53 were detached from the container 51. All of the powder 3 was extruded from each of cylinders 53 by advancing the piston 55 completely and the extruded powder was . weighed. The measured weight for each of the three cylinders 53 was 7.02g, 7.02g, 6.98g. Thus, it is ascertalned that powder can be charged into the cylinder 53 with precise accuracy by means of the apparatus shown in Figs. 30 to 1, Example 11 Now referring to Figs, 33 to 36, a powder feeding apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The powder feeding apparatus of the present example comprises a container 51 having on the side wall near the bottom thereof a pair of holes which are positioned symmetrically with respect to the center of the bottom of the container 51. An annular flange 52a is provided on one of the holes through which a piston 55 in the cylindrical form is inserted. On the other hand, a cylinder 53 is attached on the other hole to be communicated with the inside of the container 51. The piston 55 is connected to a handle through a piston rod SSa and has a length longer than tne distance between the two hole. The piston 55 is movable in the same direction as the longitudinal axis of the cylinder 53 so that it may be advanced beyond the hole at the opposite side and partially inserted into the cylinder 53. As shown in the drawings, the apparatus is further equipped with a cutting means 57 at the front hole of the cylinder 53. Although a knife 57 having a blade at the lower portion is illustrated in Figs. 33 to 36, the cutting means may be composed of a net extended across the front hole of the cylinder 53. The knife 57 is movable downwardly to cut off the pseudo agglomerated powder B. The operation of the powder feeding apparatus of this example is as follows At first, the apparatus stands as shown in Fig. 33.That is, the piston 55 is maintained at the retracted position. The container 51 contains a powder A therein. Then the piston 55 is forced to advance in the container to a position near the hole of the opposite side to thereby push the powder A into the cylinder 53 as shown in Fig, 34. The piston 55 is further advanced into the cylinder 53 so that the powder is separated from that contained in the container 51 and is compacted to a certain degree to present a pseudo agglomerated state B. The pseudoagglomerated powder 3 is extruded out of the cylinder 53 by further advancing the piston 55 as shown in Fig. 35. Then, the pseudo agglomerated powder B extruded from the outlet hole 53a is cut by the cutting means 57 to drop in the container 7 on the weighing means 8. In order to facilitate the formation of the pseudo agglomerated state, the inner diameter of the cylinder 53 may be made gradually smaller towards the outlet hole 53a. The cylinder 53 may be detachable from the container and closed dt the bottom, it may be used as a package for containing therein a powder in the pseudo agglomerated state. For such use, a package shown in Figs. B and 9 may be preferably used as the cylinder 53. Now, the method for feeding powder will be explained by way of experiment to show the technical advantage of the present invention. Experiment 1 The apparatus shown in Fig. 11 was used. The cylinder 53 was of 1.S cm in the inner diameter and 9,0 om in the length. The cylinder was provided with a scale on the outer surface thereof to facilitate the adjustment of the advancement of the piston 55. The cylinder was made of polypropylene resin and the piston 55 was of isopropylene rubber. On the other hand, the container 51 was of 4.2 cm in the inner diameter and 8.0 cm in the height. A dye dispersing agent of formalin condensate of naphtbalenesulfonlc acid was fed into the container 51 to a height of 4.0 cm. The distance L between the front portion of the cylinder 53 and the front face of the piston 55 was set at 3.5 Cm. The cylinder 53 was forced to advance in the powder up to contact the side wall of the opposite side, while maintaining the distance L at 3.5 Cm. Then, the piston 55 was advanced slightly to further compact the powder in the cylinder 53. T he cylinder 53 was then extracted from the container 51 and the portion of the pseudo agglomerated powder extruded from the top portion of the cylinder was out off so that the top portion of the compacted powder was meshed with the front portion of the cylinder 53. Then, all of the pseudo agglomerated powder contained in the cylinder 53 was weighed by feeding out the powder into the container 7 a5 shown in Fig. 2. such an operation was repeated five times and the measured weights are shown in the Table 1. Table 1 1st measurement 4.34 g 2nd measurement 4.33 g 3rd measurement 4.25 g 4th measurement 4.34 g 5th measurement 4.24 g As readily understood for the result shown in Table 1, powder can be separated from the container with preoise accuracy according to the present invention. The mean weight of the measurement is 4.30 g with a precision of 1.2 . Experiment 2 A powder of 4.35 g was separated and contained in the cylinder 53 by the method as explained in Experiment 1, The front portion of the cylined 53 was closed by mounting a cap of polypropylene resin thereon and left for a week at room temperature 15 to 3O0C . The powder was then weighed as shown in Fig. 2. Such an experimen was repeated three times. In each time, variation in the weight and the absorption of moisture have not been observed. Thus, it is understood that the cylinder 53 can be used as a good package of the powder because of its sealing property and the compaction of the powder. The apparent density of the dye dispersing agent used in Experiment I was 0.597. On the other hand, the inner volume of the cylinder 53 used in Experiment 1 was roc 4 x 1,42 x 3.5 5.39 cm3. Thus, the cylinder 53 can contain 3,22 g of the powder in the non compacted state. InExperiments 1 and 2, however, the cylinder could contain the powder in an amount 1.35 times higher than the above. Thus, a smaller sivea package can be provided according to the present invention.Experiment 3 4.3S g of the powder B was packed in the cylinder 53 and fed out by advancing the piston 55 by 0.5 cm at each time. The thus extruded powder was cut off and weighed as shown in Fig. 2. The weight W1 of the powder remaining in the cylinder and the weight w2 of the powder fed out in each advancement of 0.5 cm of the piston 55 were measured. The result is shown in Table 2. In Table 2, L Indicates the distance between the top portion of the cylinder and the front face of the piston. Tatla2 L cm W1 g W2 g 3.5 4.35 3.0 3.50 0.85 2.5 2.70 0.80 2,0 2.00 0.70 1,5 1.40 0.60 1.0 0.87 0.53 0.5 0.40 0.47 O less than 0.01 0.35 to 0.40 The result shown Table 2 is also represented inFig. 37, Such an experiment was repeated several times and the same result was obtained. That is, there is a certain relationship between the distance L and the weight w2 for a certain kind of powder. Thus, if such a relationship is determined beforehand, the feeding of the powder can be automatically conducted with precise accuracy.Experiment 4 Using the relationship shown in Fig. 37, 3.00g of the dye dispersing agent was fed with high precision. The piston 55 was advanced from L U 3.5 cm to t 1.7 cm to extrude the powder B and the extruded powder was cut off, The advancement of piston of this time took five seconds. The cut cff powder was weighed by an electronic weighing machine saled with a mark LIBROREO H 200 by SHfMAZU CORPORATION. The measured weight was 2.650 g. The piston 55 was further advanced to L I 1.6 cm and the extruded powder was cut off and measured. The total weight of the fed out powder was 2.86 g. The piston 55 was further advanced to L 1.5 cm and the extruded powder was cut off two times to adjust minutely the amount of the fed out powder. The total weight of the powder fed out with the above operations was 3.002 g. These feeding operations took 12 seconds and the error was only 0.002 g. Although these experiments were conducted with a dye dispersing agent of formal in condensate of naphthalenesulfonic acid, the same result could be obtained with other kinds of powder, such as a dye dispersing agent saled with a trademark of SUMICARON RED S 2GF by BUMITOMO CHEMICAL Co., Ltd. and commercially available anhydrous sodium sulfate powder.
