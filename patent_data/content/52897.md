# A sized multifilament yarn of an aromatic polyamide, a yarn package, a woven fabric and a process for making said yarn.

## Abstract
A multifilament yarn of an aromatic polyamide, in particular poly p phenylene terephthalamide, having a tenacity of at least 15 cN dtex and an initial modulus of at least 400 cN dtex is provided with a water soluble size, the filaments of the yarn having a cohesion corresponding to a Manra number not higher than 40. The yarn is made by subjecting a non sized yarn having a moisture content which is lower than its equilibrium moisture content, while under a tension of at most 0,25 cN dtex, to a continuous wetting treatment with an aqueous solution of a size and subse quently winding the treated yarn into a yarn package. The yarn package contains a single continuous length of the sized yarn. The sized yarn is suitable as warp and weft yarn in the weaving industry.
