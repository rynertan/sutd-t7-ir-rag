# Creep compensated weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A digital scale compensated for creep by first obtaining and storing a mathematical representation of creep as a func tion of time for the particular scale. The current creep state of the scale is continually calculated, stored and used to correct the current weight indication for creep. The current creep state is obtained by calculating the increment of creep since the previous determination of creep state and combining it with the stored previous creep state.
