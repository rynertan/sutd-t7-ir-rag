## Description
Method of Manufacturinq Double Skin, Polyurethane Foam CoreBuildinq PanelsThe invention relates to the manufacture of double skin, polyurethane foam core building panels The principal use of such panels is in roofs and sidewalls of buildings.Double skin, polyurethane foam core panels are described inCanada patents 918,873 899,588 and copending application 116,743 filed June 25, 1971.Double skin panels having polyurethane foam therebetween in which glass fibers are homogeneously dispersed have been described in UIS. patent 3,981,654.In the manufacture of double sin, polyurethane foam core panels of the type with which the present invention is concerned, a first skin receives a supply of foam forming ingredients on its upper surface the second skin is positioned in fixed juxtaposition to the first skin the foam forming ingredients are allowed to rise from the first skin toward the inner surface of the second skin When the foam forming ingredients first make contact with the inner surface of the second skin, adhesion occurs. Thereafter the continuously rising polyurethane foam expands outwardly toward the perimeter of the two fixed skins in addition to continuing to rise from the first skin upwardly toward the second skin.The outward migration of the foam forming ingredients toward the perimeter of the two skins, after initial contact with the upper skin has occurred, creates stresses in the foam core which result in a dense layer of poorly structured polyurethane foam in the region adjacent to the second skin. In some circumstances, the poor struc ture is not significant. However when the double skin, polyurethane foam core building panels are installed with a cold exterior surface and a warm or hot interior surface for example during the construction of a building which is not closed in blisters can form on the surface of the second skin.The principal object of this invention is to provide a method for manufacturing double skin, polyurethane foam building panels which do not develop poorly structured foam in the region adjacent to the rise to skin.The object is accomplished by applying to the interior surface of the second skin heroin referred to as the rise to skin a preformed pad of continuous filament glass fiber. The polyurethane foam forming ingredients are applied to the inner surface of the first skin herein referred to as the rise from skin . The foam forming ingredients expand and move toward the rise to skin but encounter the preformed pad of continuous filament glass fibers before they encounter the surface of the rise to skin. The rising foam forming ingredients are thus intercepted and migrate toward the perimeter of the panel before they are significantly stressed in the upper direction against the rise to skin.As a result of this process, the product double skin, polyurethane foam core building panels do not develop the poorly structured foam in the region adjacent to the rise to skin. In drawings which illustrate embc ents of the invention,FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of a typical assembly line for manufacturing double skin, polyurethane foam core panels.FIGURES 2, 3, 4 are sectional views of a building panel taken along the lines 2 2, 3 3 and 4 4 respectively of FIGURE 1.FIGURE 5 is a perspective illustration of a pad of con tinuous filament glass fibers useful in the practice of the present invention.FIGURE 1 illustrates a typical installation for manufacturing double skin, polyurethane foam core panels. A continuous conveyor means such as a conveyor belt 10 delivers panel components from the entry end 11 toward the discharge end 12 at which finished panels are recovered. A typical panel includes a bottom skin 13 and a top skin 14. Each of the skins 13, 14 is equipped with some form of marginal elements 15, 16, 17, 18 which serve partially to enclose the polyurethane foam and serve as means for interconnecting assembled panels. For the purposes of the present invention, the lip means 15, 16, 17, 18 are illustrated as simple upstanding flanges. Initially, as shown in FIGURE 2, the two skins 13, 14 are assembled in a juxtaposed relationship. It will be observed that a pad 19 of continuous filament glass fiber has been applied to the under surface of the upper skin 14.As the panel components advance from left to right in FIGURE 1, a supply of polyurethane foam forming ingredients 20 is deposited on the inner surface of the bottom skin 13 which is referred to as a rise from skin. The foam forming ingredients 20 are in a foaming condition and rise upwardly away from the rise from skin 13 toward the inner surface of the skin 14 referred to as the rise to skin . The pad 19 of continuous filament glass fiber is secured to the rise to skin 14.Referring once again to FIGURE 1 it will be observed that the two skins 13, 14 are brought together into their final geometrical relationship and are retained in that final geometrical relationship by means of applied pressure indicated by the arrows 21 of FIGURE 1. While the pressure is applied and maintained against the skins 13, 14, the foam forming ingredients 20 expand to fill all of the space between the two skins 13, 14. The foam is prevented from squirting out between the lip means 15, 17 and lip means 16, 18 by appropriate means not shown which may be a closely fitting barrier strip or molding surface.After the foaming is essentially completed, the resulting panel in FIGURE 4 includes the foamed polyurethane core 20 and, in the region of the rise to skin 14, includes a homogeneous composition wherein the foam entirely fills the interstices of the pad 19 of continuous filament glass fibers and also adheres to the rise to skin 14. The cotinuous filament glass fiber material, illustrated inFIGURE 5, is commercially available from various suppliers for use as a filter media in air filters.A particularly useful form of the continuous filament glass fiber pad 19 has a density of about 168 grams per cubic foot. The nominal fiber diameter is 38 microns. The material is available in rolls as a continuous blanket thick by 24 wide. The binder which is employed by the glass fiber pad manufacturer is a urrea formaldehyde resin.While the product is known in the trade as continuous filament fiber, obviously it is not manufactured of a single continuous filament but of many long filaments which are randomly interwoven. The continuous filament pad is distinguishable from the pads of glass fibers which are fabricated from chopped lengths of ,lass fibers by the nearly continuous length of the Ã¬naividual filaments.In the practice of the present invention, the pad 19 of continuous filament glass fiber can have a thickness of 0.1 to 1.0 inch. A preferred thickness is approximately 1 4 inch.The pad 19 of continuous filament glass fiber may be adhered to the under surface of the panel 14 by means of dots of suitable adhesive or by means of strips of adhesive tape or in any manner which will maintain the pad in proximity to the rise to skin. Complete pad to surface adhesion is not required.Moreover it is not necessary that the pad 19 extend over the entire exposed rise to skin. However, a major portion including the central portion of the rise to skin should be covered with the pad.While the present invention has been illustrated in connection with a semicontinuous process for producing individual building panels, nevertheless the principle can Ee adapted to the production of a continuous panel wherein the two facing sheets are drawn from coiled stock and shaped into continuous double skin panels, for example, as disclosed in Canada patent 1,018,443.While the present invention has been described in connection with an assembly process of FIGURE 1 wherein the skins are shown horizontal, there are some panel fabricating processes wherein the opposed skins are inclined at an angle during formation and foam rising. The present invention is equally adaptable to such inclined panel assembly processes. Comparative ExamplesFour commercial building panels were produced in a commercial building panel line, each having a length of 10 feet and a width of 30 inches. The panels were 2 inches thick skinto skin and had a polyurethane foam composition which generates a 2.15 pounds per cubic foot free rise density.Note Inasmuch as the polyurethane foam is allowed to rise between facing sheets, the actual core density is greater than the free rise density of the ingredients.Panels 1, 2, and 3 each had a one inch thick pad of continuous filament glass fiber pad adhered to the under surface of the rise to skin by means of spots of hot melt glue applied from a hot glue gun.Panel 4 was fabricated in the same line, at the same time as panels 1, 2, 3 but did not include the pad of continuous filament glass fiber. Each of panels was tested for shear modulus The results of the shear modulus test are Panel Shear Modulus psi 1 717 2 675 3 775 4 435It will be observed that the three panels 1, 2, 3 fabricated in accordance with the present invention exhibited superior shear modulus when compared to the otherwise similar building panel which did not include the pad of continuous filament glass fiber. The shear modulus is determined by conducting a chamber method shear test ASTM E 72 to determine actual centerspan deflection of a panel. The deflection 6 is EMI7.1 wherein W is the uniform load pounds per square foot L is the span feet E is Young s modulus for the skins psi I is the moment of inertia of the metal skins, per foot of width inches4 Ac is the cross sectional area of the foam core, per foot of width inches2 Gc is the shear modulus psi .It will be observed that an increase in the shear modulus Gc will reduce the deflection of the resulting panel for a fixed load. Hence increased shear modulus is a desirable property in a foam core building panel.
