# CIRCUIT BREAKER ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A multiple pole circuit breaker in which the multiple poles of each circuit breaker are mechanically related to a single operating point. Their single operating points are pivotally related to a first common pivot point, which is fixed in relation to a common frame which supports both circuit breakers. Their single operating pivot points are additionally pivotally related to a second common pivot point. A guide arrangement, fixed to the common frame, guides the second common pivot point in a predetermined rectilinear path when actuated by an operating mechanism which includes a shaft arranged to extend through a transformer tank wall to a master operating handle.
