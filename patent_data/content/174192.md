## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING HEAT RESISTANT MILK PROTEIN HAVING GOOD PROCESSABILITY AND OR ACID AND BASE RESISTANCE AND A FOOD PRODUCT CONTAINING SUCH PROTEIN The present invention relates to a process for preparing a heat resistant milk protein having good processability and or acid and base resistance.More particularly. it relates to a process for preparing a milk protein which has enough heat resistance to prevent the heat softening properties of caesin which is a main component of milk protein as well as such good processability that it can readily be made into a desired shape. and hence. is useful as a raw material for food. and the present invention also enables the production of a milk protein which is resistant to acids and bases and is useful as a raw material for food and as or in a food additive. Unlike a heat curdling protein such as globulin, albumin or the like, casein which is a main component of a milk protein has heat softening properties. Due of such properties, it is extremely difficult to produce a food product such as, for example. an artificial meat product containing casein or milk protein as a main component thereof and having a texture which can be subjected to heat cooking because its texture is liable to be spoiled by heating. Accordingly, various methods have been heretofore proposed to modify the heat softening properties of casein. For example. a method in which milk protein is formed into fibers and boiled in a salt bath or treated with a compound having an aldehyde group to give resistance to heat softening Schmandk et al, Die Nahrung, 20, 10. 911 914 1976 or Japanese PatentPublication No. 26381 1981 , and a method in which milk protein is formed into fibers and treated with an aqueous phosphate to give resistance to heat softening Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Nos. 79048 1977 and 79049 1977 are known.However, resistance to heat softening provided by these methods is not always sufficient, and in any case, milk protein is previously fixed in a predetermined shape such as a fibrous form and then the thus shaped protein is treated to give resistance to heat softening.Therefore, the protein cannot be finished in a desired optional shape. Further, a method which comprises treating a solution containing casein with a protease, a phosphate and a multivalent metallic compound to gel the solution and then heating the gel to give heat curdling properties has been also known JapanesePatent Publication No. 32857 1983 . However, since this method provides heat curdling properties to the protein by gelation and heating, the protein cannot be finished in a desired optional shape either. In addition, casein exhibits excellent emulsifying and thickening activities in a system within a neutral pH range or a system containing no salt or containing a salt in a low concentration and.therefore, it is widely employed as a raw material or an additive for food of such systems. However, casein aggregates and precipitates at a pH range of not more than about 4.6 which is the isoelectric point thereof. Further, casein also aggregates in the presence of a large amount of a salt such as e.g.sodium chloride. and salting out of casein occurs.Accordingly. in a system within an acidic pH range of containing a large amount of a salt, the excellent properties and functions of casein are spoiled and it is very difficult to use casein in food of an acidic pH range or food containing a large amount of a salt. The present invention is based upon the findings a when an aqueous solution or dispersion containing case in and an acidic polysaccharide is heated under certain conditions and the resulting heated product is formed into a desired shape and treated with a multivalent metallic compound, the heat softening properties of casein can be readily modified and, in addition. the products can be finished in desired optional shapes and b by subjecting casein and an acidic polysaccharide to a heat treatment under particular conditions, it is possible to obtain casein which is resistant to both acids and bases and can exhibit the excellent properties and functions thereof even in food of an acidic pH range of food containing a large amount of a salt as well as in food of neutral pH range of food containing no salt or only a small amount of salt. The certain conditions noted above for imparting heat resistance and shape retention are a preferred embodiment of the particular conditions noted above in relation to acid base resistance. Thus according to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing a milk protein resistant to acids and bases which comprises subjecting an aqueous solution or dispersion containing casein and 0.5 30 parts by weight the term parts hereinafter means parts by weight of an acidic polysaccharide per 100 parts of casein to heat treatment at pH 7.3 to 10.5 and at a temperature of not less than 700C for 3 minutes or more. In the process of the present invention, the thickening activity of the resulting milk protein can be further improved by carrying out the heat treatment in the presence of calcium ion or magnesium ion. The present invention also permits the provision of a casein having good heat resistance and also enables the preparation of a milk protein which has an excellent processability. Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention an aqueous solution or suspension containing casein and 0.5 20 parts by weight of an acidic polysaccharide per 100 parts of casein may be subjected to heat treatment at pH 7.5 to 10.5 and at a temperature of not less than 70 C for 5 minutes or more, and the resultant material thereafter formed into a desired shape, and then the thus shaped material soaked in an aqueous solution containing a multivalent metallic compound in an amount of 10 mM or more as multivalent metal to provide heat resistance to the casein.Furthermore, the material resulting from the above heat treatment can be readily formed into a desired shape and, by soaking it in an aqueous solution containing a multivalent metallic compound to give shape retention. milk protein can be finished in a desired optional shape such as fibers, membranes, spheres and the like. In order to carry out the process of the present invention, an aqueous solution or dispersion of case in and an acidic polysaccharide is first prepared. The form of casein used may be. e.g. casein sr sodium caseinate. Casein is used by dissolving it with an alkali such as e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia, sodium carbonate, sodium triphosphate, potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide when using an alkali such as calcium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide which is a calcium or magnesium ion source, as described hereinafter, the amount thereof should be 1.4 parts per 100 parts of casein or less to achieve the desired improvement of thickening activity. Sodium caseinate is used by dissolving it in warm water. The amount of casein used is usually 3 or 5 hereinafter means wt or more based on the entire aqueous solution or dispersion to be prepared, generally, 3 30 is preferred. e.g. 5 308. When questions of heat resistance and shape retention are paramount, and casein per se is used, the protein is used by dissolving it in an alkaline solution free from a multivalent cation, for example.in an aqueous solution of an alkali such as e.g.sodium hydroxide. potassium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia. sodium carbonate, sodium triphosphate or potassium carbonate. For the above purposes, the amount of casein used is 5 hereinafter means wt or more based on the entire aqueous solution or dispersion to be prepared, generally. 5 30 is preferred. When it is less than 5 , sufficient shape retention cannot be obtained in the subsequent treatment with a multivalent metal which results in difficulty in handling. The acidic polysaccharide may be. e.g., alginic acid, sodium alginate. alginic acid propylene ester, carrageenin any one of K , A and 1 our furcellaran. Other polysaccharides which may be employed in the invention are gum karaya, gum ghatti, gum tragacanth, xanthan gum, methyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose or low methoxyl pectin. They can be used alone or in a combination thereof. The acidic polysaccharide is used in the ratio of 0.5 30 parts per 100 parts of casein to achieve acid and base resistance. When this ratio of the acidic polysaccharide to casein is either too small or too large, the desired resistance to acids and bases is not to be expected. When heat resistance and shape retention are under consideration, the acidic polysaccharide is used in a ratio of 0.5 20 parts per 100 parts of casein.When this ratio of the acidic polysaccharide is either too small or too large, the desired heat resistance is not expected and, particularly, when it is too large.a problem results in that viscosity is too high. The aqueous solution or dispersion can be prepared by dissolving or dispersing casein and an acidic polysaccharide simultaneously or successively in hot water or the above aqueous alkaline solution according to a conventional manner. Alternatively, it can be prepared by separately dissolving or dispersing casein and an acidic polysaccharide in advance and then mixing them. Optionally, other ingredients, for example. a neutral saccharide such as glucose, sucrose or starch. oils and fats and the like, may be added to this aqueous solution or dispersion. In any event, after forming the aqueous solution or dispersion this is heated at pH 7.3 10.5 and at a temperature of 70 C or higher for 3 minutes or more. For heat resistance and shape retention heating is at pH 7.5 10.5 for 5 minutes or more also at 700C or higher . When an aqueous alkaline solution is employed to dissolve the case in, adjustment of the pH of the solution or dispersion is not always required.However, when adjustment of pH is required, it is carried out with an alkali free from multivalent cations when heat resistance and shape retention is paramount . Although there is no intention to a particular theory, it is believed that, by the heat treatmentcof the present invention, casein and the acidic polysaccharide form a complex and, thereby, the desired resistance to acids and bases is provided.Provided such cations have hitherto been excluded, a desired change in the configuration of the casein results by subsequent treatment with a multivalent metallic compound providing heat resistance to the casein. In order to form a desired complex, the pH of the heat treatment must be, as described above, in the range from 7.3 to 10.5, e.g. 7.5 to 10.5. It is considered that formation of the desired complex is insufficient when the heat treatment is carried out at a pH of lower than 7.3, and the complex becomes unstable due to breakage of disulfide bonds when the heat treatment is carried out at a pH of higher than 10.5. Therefore. it is necessary to carry out the heat treatment in this pH range and at a temperature of 70 C or higher for 3 minutes or more.The upper limit of the heating temperature and the heating time are not specifically limited unless there is any adverse effect on the resulting product. In general, however, the heat treatment is preferably carried out at 70 1300C for up to 90 minutes, e.g. 5 to 90 minutes in view of operational and economic efficiency. In the present invention, when imparting acidand base resistance, when the heat treatment is carried out in the presence of calcium ion or magnesium ion, the thickening activity of casein is further improved. For this purpose, it is preferable to add a calcium ion source or a magnesium ion source prior to or during the heat treatment. As the calcium or magnesium ion source. there can be used e.g.calcuim chloride, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium lactate. calcium hydroxide, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, magnesium citrate and or magnesium lactate. The calcium or magnesium ion source can be used in a ratio of 0.1 to 1.4 parts per 100 parts of casein calculated as calcium or magnesium ion. When this ratio is too high, the thickening activity is rather spoiled. After cooling, the solution or dispersion thus treated per se can be used directly as a milk protein resistant to acids and bases. Alternatively, it can be further subjected to additional processes, such as e.g. concentration or drying, in a conventional manner. When it is desired to impart heat resistance and shape retention, the resultant material from the aforesaid heat treatment is, directly or after cooling, formed into a desired shape and soaked in an aqueous solution containing a multivalent metal. The resultant material from the heat treatment can be formed into a desired shape according to any conventional manner, for example, by extruding it from a extruder having a die or nozzle of a corresponding shape into a particular shape such as e.g. a fiber, membrane or sphere. It has been found that, when 0.5 part or more, preferably 1 20 parts, of a polyglycerin fatty acid ester is added to the material resulting from the heat treatment in this step, sticking of the processed material to apparatus used in this step or in the subsequent step is minimized and, thereby, the yield is improved. As the polyglycerin fatty acid ester, the oleate or stearate ester, wherein the average degree of polymerization of glycerin is 5 or more, is preferred. The multivalent metallic compound may be, e.g., one or more compounds selected from calcium chloride, calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium hydroxide, magnesium chloride. magnesium sulfate, magnesium citrate, magnesium lactate and magnesium hydroxide. The multivalent metallic compound is used by dissolving it in water at a concentration of 10 mM or more as multivalent metal, generally 70 1500 mM. If the concentration of the multivalent metal is too low, the desired heat resistance and shape retention cannot be obtained. The shaped product can be soaked in an aqueous solution containing the multivalent metallic compound according to a conventional manner. When the concentration of the multivalent metal is higher.soaking can be performed at room temperature for only a few seconds to provide sufficient heat resistance and shape retention. Even if the concentration is low, soaking at room temperature for 5 30 minutes is sufficient. Furthermore, the soaking solution may be heated, if necessary. Thus, after soaking, the desired heat resistant milk protein of the present invention, which has excellent processability, can be obtained. The milk protein of the present invention thus obtained can be used directly as it is, or, after subjecting it to additional processes, to produce a food product such as, for example, an artificial meat product having a texture which can be subjected to e.g. heat cooking. The results of tests for the effect of the addition of an acidic polysaccharide and the relation between processing conditions and both heat resistant properties and processability are illustrated hereinafter. Test 1 Effect of addition of acidic polysaccharide 50 ml Portions of warm water are placed in three 200 ml beakers A, B and C . 0.5 g of Carrageenin and 0.5 g of locust bean gum were added respectively to the DeakersA and B, and stirred to effect solution.

The milk protein obtained by the process of the present invention and which has acid and base resistance can be used as a raw material or an additive in acidic foods because it is resistant to acids. Thus, for example1 it can be used as an emulsifier for e.g. sour cream or dressings.Furthermore, since the milk protein obtained by the process of the present invention can produce high viscosity in the presence of calcium ion or magnesium ion without salting out even under a high concentration of sodium chloride, it can be used as a raw material or an additive in food containing a large of a salt. Thus, or example, it can be used as a thickening agent for a sauce or an emulsifyer or gelling agent for ham and sausage containing sodium chloride in concentration as high as 3 to 5 . In addition, it is possible to develop new food products by utilizing the novel properties of the milk protein of the present invention. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof. Example 1 5 kg of f Carrageenin was added to and dissolved in 350 litres of warm water to which was added 100 kg of case in. 72 litres of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide was added to the resulting mixture to dissolve the casein. The pH of the solution was 8.1.The solution was maintained at 800C for 30 minutes, and then it was spray drie to give 93 kg cf the desired milk protein powder. According to a conventional method, a cream of the following formulation was produced by using the resulting milk protein powder. Ingredient Amount Lard 350 gThe above obtained milk protein powder 50 g Starch syrup powder 100 g Water 650 g Homogenizer pressure 150 kg cm2 10 ml of The cream was added to 100 ml of 10 aqueous solution of sodium chloride. After dispersion, it was distributed into tubes. Each tube was heated to 900C and the acareaation of lard was estimated. However, aggregation of lard was not observed. No denaturation of the protein due to sodium chloride was observed either. Furthermore, when the heated dispersion was diluted Sn times with water and the emulsion was subjected to microscopic pbservation, no aggregation of fat spheres was observed and uniform dispersion of fat spheres having diameter of 1 3 microns was observed. Example 2 1 g of Xanthan gum was dissolved in warm water 900 ml to which was added 100 g of sodium caseinate and 2 g of sodium tripolyphasphate to effect solution. The pH was 7.5.The resulting solution was heated to 750C and maintained at this temperature for 5 minutes. Then, the solution was cooled to room temperature to obtain the desired milk protein solution. According to conventional method, a sour cream of the following formulation was produced by using the resulting solution. Ingredient AmountMilk protein solution 600 gButter oil 800 gLactose 100 gWater 480 gPolyglycerin tatty acid ester 20 gYeast extract 0,5 g After pre homogenizing the mixture of these inaredients the mixture was pasteurized at 800C for 5 minutes, homogenized at 50 kg cmê and then placed in a sterilized closed container. After cooling, 1 of a starter of lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus bulgaricus was added and the mixture was subjected to lactic acid fermentation at 370C for 10 hours. When the fermentation mixture reached to pH 4.5, fermentation was ceased by heating to 80 C and the mixture was homogenized at 45 kg cm and cooled to below 100C. The sour cream thus obtained was at pH 4.4 and no aggregation of protein was observed.It was in a good emulsified state and showed excellent form retention. Example 3 0.3 g of Xanthan gum and 1.7 g of H carrageenin was added to 370 ml of warm water and the resulting mixture was heated at 800C to effect solution, after which 2.0 g of calcium chloride dihydrate was ded and dissolved. 100 g of casein was dispersed in the solution and 30 ml of 10 8 aqueous sodium hydroxide was added to dissolve casein. The pH of the solution was 7.6. The solution was heated at 800C for 30 minutes. Then, the solution was divided into two equal portions and sodium chloride was dissolved in one portion in such an amount that the concentration thereof became 5 . Each portion of the solution was cooled to 50C anathe qel strength thereof was measured by using a rheometer.Further, the same procedure was repeated except that calcium chloride was not added and the gel strength of each portion was measured. In addition, as a control, the same procedure was repeated using a sodium caseinate solution of the same concentration. The results are shown in Table9 Table 9 Milk protein solution Gel strength g cmê with NaCl without NaCl Present invention Caul2 680 189 Present invention without Caul2 218 121 Control 60 70 As is seen form Table 9, the milk protein solution of the present invention shows a high gel strength even in the presence of sodium chloride. In Particular, when calcium ion is present, a higher gel strength is obtained. Example 4 To 900 ml of warm water was added 3 g of sodium alginate and 10 a of. FoRtU caseinate to effect solution. 5 g of Sodium tripolyphasphate was added to this solution and reacted by heating at 900C for 5 minutes to obtain the desired milk protein solution. The pH thereof was 8.1. A coffee whitener was produced by adding 240 g of coconut oil melting point 320C , 330 g of Pinedex starch hydrolysate and then 10 g of polyglycerin fatty acid ester to the milk protein solution thus obtained and homogenizing 2 the mixture at 150 kg cm . The coffee whitener was added to coffee pH 5.0 in such a ratio that 15 ml thereof was contained per 250 ml of coffee and the mixture was filled in cans. The cans were sterilized by autoclaving at 1210C for 30 minutes. Next morning, the cans were opened and the contents thereof were tested. As the result, the coffee whitener was uniformly dispersed in coffee and no aggregation of protein and separation of oil were observed. Reference Example 1 The same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated except that the amount of e carrageenin was decreased to 0.2 kg or the heat treatment was carried out at pH 7.0 tc obtain respective milk protein powders. According to the same procedure as in Example 1, a cream was produced by using each milk protein powder thus obtained. When each cream obtained was added to 10 z aqueous sodium chloride solution and heated, fat was aggregated at 400C and the cream was separated into an aqueous layer and an oil layer by further elevation of the temperature. In addition, when the emulsion without heating was subjected to microscopic observation, aggregation of fat spheres was observed. Reference Example 2 The same procedure as in Example 2 was repeated except that the amount of xanthan gum was decreased to 0.3 g, the heat treatment was carried out at pH 7.0 or the heat treatment was carried cut at 650C to obtain respective milk protein solutions. According to the same procedure as in Example 2, the production of a sour cream was tried using each milk protein solution thus obtained. However, it was very difficult to obtain a cream like state due to aggregation of protein. Example 5 0.5 g of l Carrageenin was added te and dissolved in 90 ml of warm water to which was added 10 g of sodium caseinate and the resulting solution was stirred to prepare a solution containing casein and carrageenin. To the solution was added 10 ml of 20 aqueous tripolyphosphoric acid to adjust pH to 8.3. The solution was heated at 60 OC for 30 minutes, and was extruded through a stainless tube having an inner diameter of 0.5 mm into 5 aqueous calcium chloride solution and soaked in the calcium chloride solution for 10 minutes. Then, the soaked product was taken out to give 80 g of a desired string like milk protein of about 0.7 mm diameter. The above string like milk protein retained its shape even after it was boiled in boiling water for 30 minutes and, in addition, it remained very elastic and the boiling water did not become cloudy. Example 6 2 kg of Casein was dispersed in 8 L of warm water to which was added 100 ml of 28 aqueous ammonia to dissolve the casein. Then, 100 of 4 aqueous sodium alginate was added to the solution and pH was adjusted to 7.7 with 30 ml of 10 N sodium hydroxide to prepare a solution containing casein and sodium alginate. The resulting solution was heated at 73 OC for 10 minutes. After heating, 20 g of polyglycerin stearate average polymerization degree of glycerinbe 7 was added and the mixture was completely stirred and extruded through a slit ofC.2 x 50 mm into 100 ml of 10 aqueous calcium chloride to give 9.9 kg of a desired membrane shaped milk protein of 0.2 mm thick and 55 mm wide. After washed with water, the product was boiled in boiling water for 30 minutes, but there was no change in its shape and the boiling water did not become cloudy. The texture of the product after boiling was like sliced boiled beef. Example 7 23 g of Furcellaran was added to 350 g of warm water and the resulting mixture was stirred to effect solution, after which was added 150 g of sodium caseinate which was dissolved to prepare a soltrticn ccntaning casein and furcellaran. The solution was adjusted to pH 10.0 with 5N sodium hydroxide and heated and treated in an autoclave at 1210C for 15 minutes. Then, the product was intermittently extruded through a cylinder of 5 mm diameter to give desired sphere shaped milk protein of 5 mm diameter. The product did not change its shape after being boiled in boiling water for 30 minutes, and further the boiling water did not become cloudy. The texture was like white meat cf chicken. Example 8 0.5 g of K Carrageenin was added te 400 g of warm water and dissolved. Then, 100 g of sodium caseinate was added to the mixture and stirred to effect solution. 170 ml of 10 Aqueous sodium polyphosphate was added to the mixture to adjust pH to 8.0 and the mixture was heated at 80 C for 30 minutes.After heating, 100 g of hydrogenated soybean oil, 2 g of a sucrose fatty acid ester, anda small amount of a yellow coloring agent and a flavor there added to the mixture which was subject to homogenization ata pressure of 150 kg cm2 and extrudedfroma0.2 x 50 mm slit into 5 aqueous calcium chloride to give 630 g of a desired me.mbrane shaped milk protein. When the product was boiled in boiling water, there were no separation of the coloring agent and oil and no change in product shape. The milk protein showed an appearance and texture similar to Yuba skin of boiled soy milk . Example 9 To 400 ml of warm water was added 7 ml of 28 aqueous ammonia and further slowly added a mixture of 100 g of casein and 10 g of carrageenin with stirring to effect solution to obtain a solution of pH 8.5 containing casein and carrageenin. This solution was heated at 800C for 30 minutes and mixed with 50 g of beef paste, a small amount of beef flavor and 50 g of lard dissolved by heating, and the mixture was thoroughly mixed. The mixture was placed in â refrigerator overnight to gel and cut into appropriate size and soaked in 3 aqueous calcium chloride for 30 minutes to give a desired block shaped milk protein. After the products were boiled in boiling water for 30 minutes, a part of oil and beef paste which were not fully emulsified were separated, but there was no cther change. The texture of the products were similar to roast.
