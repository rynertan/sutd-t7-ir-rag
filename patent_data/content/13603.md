# Improved read only memory and method of programming such a memory.

## Abstract
A programmable read only memory PROM includes a first plurality of conductive lines 26 , a second plurality of conductive lines 32 and polycrystalline silicon material 28 therebetween. At the crossing points of the first and second plurality of lines doped regions 30 are provided in the polycrystalline silicon 28 in contact with a second line 32 and which extend at least partially through the material. To provide a diode interconnect at any crossing point, the associated region is irradiated by a laser beam, e.g. at areas 34 spaced from the second lines 32 , to either cause diffusion of dopant atoms to the underlaying conductive line 26 or activate implanted ions, thereby electrically interconnecting the first and second lines through a diode. The PROM is readily fabricated as part of a monolithic integrated circuit or electrical array and can be programmed after completion of the fabrication process.
