## Abstract
An improved peristaltic infusion pump and disposable cassette 20 for use therewith. The cassette includes a hollow conduit arrangement 40 with a section of elastic tubing 42 and adapted to pass intravenous fluids therethrough. The conduit 40 is fixedly mounted in a rigid cassette 20 wherein an intermediate section of the elastic tubing 42 is free to move in a direction perpendicular to the base of the cassette 20 . The infusion pump includes a pump cassette housing designed to properly align and support the cassette and encloses a pump rotor assembly 120 designed to interface with the elastic tube 42 of the cassette 20 so as to generate a peristaltic force in the hollow conduit arrangement.
