# Control circuit.

## Abstract
A system for controlling the temperature at a location which is heated by a heater. The heater is intermittently energized by a source of electrical power in response to control signals from a temperature control circuit. The temperature control circuit includes a comparator amplifier having one input coupled to a sensed temperature signal. The other input to the comparator amplifier is a set point temperature level. The sensed temperature signal is pro duced by a bridge circuit including a temperature sensor at the location which is being heated. The comparator amplifier includes a feedback network to establish a pulse output of a certain frequency when the two inputs are equal. In order to expand the operating band of the comparator amplifier, an a c voltage is introduced superimposed on the set point input. Over the operating band the output pulses from the comparator amplifier are inversely proportional to the sensed temperature signal, and these pulses are used to control the application of electrical power to the heater.
