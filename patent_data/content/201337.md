# Early progressive junction extrusion system.

## Abstract
Apparatus for forming an elastomeric strip formed from at least two elastomeric compounds, for example to use as a pneumatic tire tread strip. Extrusion means advance two or more elastomeric materials 60 under pressure toward a final chamber from which material is extruded between a final die 50 and a roller 70 . A head assembly 30 and a preform die 62, 64 are positioned in serial flow relationship between said extrusion means and said final die, and flow chambers formed within said head assembly and said preform die intercommuni cate said extrusion means with said final chamber. Flow cham bers within the preform die converge to at least one common junction within said preform die to form a single preform die exit chamber wherein a multi material flow of elastomeric materials is established for passage into said final chamber for final extrusion therefrom.
