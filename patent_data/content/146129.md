# An apparatus for recording and reproducing a video signal.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording and reproducing a video signal on a recording medium by frequency modulation and demodulation, the video signal being applied thereto and being obtained therefrom as an analog composite color video signal is disclosed, which includes a circuit 5 for digitally separating the video signal to a first frequency band signal and a second frequency band signal including a color subcarrier, a circuit 6 for converting the frequency band signal to first and second base band signals, a circuit 10 for time compressing at least the first and second base band signals, a circuit 13, 14, 15 for recording and reproducing the first frequency band signal and the time compressed first and second base band signals in an analog mode, a circuit 11 for digitally recombining the reproduced first frequency band signal and the time compressed first and second base band signals, and a circuit 12 for converting the recombined digital video signal to the analog composite color video signal.
