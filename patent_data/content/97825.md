# TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER WITH CONSTANT CURRENT SOURCE

## Abstract
A transistor circuit is used as a signal amplifier which has almost no possibility of oscillation in an IC. The transistor circuit includes a cascade connection of differential ampli fiers. Each of the amplifiers comprises a differential pair of bipolar transistors and an enhancement type MOSFET as a constant current source. The MOSFET of each amplifier is connected in the common source mode, and the drain is connected to the emitters of the differential pair of bipolar transistors. The sources of all the MOSFETS are connected to a common ground line.
