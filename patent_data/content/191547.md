## Description
DescriptionCable That May Be Employed As A Sensor This invention relates to the detection of leaks from liquid containing members. It is known, in order to detect leaks from a liquid containing member, e.g a pipe or a storage container, to make use of an elongate sensor which is secured to the exterior of the member and which undergoes a detectable change when it is contacted by the liquid. The sensor can be capable of undergoing the change at any point along its length or only at selected points. Particularly useful systems for detecting and locating leaks are described inEuropean Patent Publication Nos. 84304502.2, 84308260.3 and 85302559.1. We have found that, in the use of such elongate sensors, false alarms may result from moisture or nuisance wetting of the sensor due to capillary action. At the same time, it is desirable after a true alarm, to quickly and conveniently clear the sensor of residual moisture or nuisance wetting so that the sensor can be restored to an original operating condition and the detection of leaks can begin anew. The present invention substantially mitigates the problems of false alarms due to moisture or nuisance wetting and assists in providing quick restoration of a sensor to its original operating condition, e.g. in less than 1 minute. In one aspect, the invention provides a sensor cable for detecting the presence of an electrically conductive liquid, which cable comprises two elongate conductors, each conductor having an exposed surface which, when the cable is immersed in the liquid, is contacted by the liquid, and an insulating member which contacts each of the conductors and physically separates them in such a way that, when the cable is immersed in the liquid, the conductors become electrically connected by the liquid along a path which is not a straight line. In a second aspect, the invention provides a sensor cable for detecting the presence of an electrically conductive liquid, which cable comprises two elongate conductors, each conductor having an exposed surface which, when the cable is immersed in the liquid, is contacted by the liquid, and a concave insulating member which contacts the conductors and physically separates them in such a way that the conductors become electri cally connected by the liquid when the concavity is filled. In a third aspect, the invention comprises a method for detecting the presence of an electrically conductive liquid, which method comprises the step of placing a sensor cable in an environment which may contain the liquid, the cable comprising two elongate conductors, each conductor having an exposed surface which, when the cable is immersed in the liquid, is contacted by the liquid, and an insulating member which contacts each of the conductors and physically separates them in such a way that the conductors become electrically connected by the liquid along a path which is not a straight line. In a fourth aspect, the invention comprises a method for detecting the presence of an electrically conductive liquid, which method comprises the step of placing a sensor cable in an environment which may contain the liquid, the cable comprising two elongate conductors, each conductor having an exposed surface which, when the cable is immersed in the liquid, is contacted by the liquid, and a concave insulating member which contacts the conductors and physically separates them in such a way that the conductors become electrically connected by the liquid when the concavity is filled. Preferably the conductors cannot be mutually wetted by capillary draw across the insulating member. In some embodiments the conductors are metal conductors coated with a conductive polymer.Preferably, the direction of the path leaving one electrode is at an angle of at least 300, preferably at least 900, especially at least 1600, to the direction of the path leaving the other electrode. The invention can be used to detect leaks from liquid containing members e.g. a pipe or storage container which contains conductive liquid, for example, water. Accordingly, the insulating member preferably is composed of a water impermeable film, for example, a polymeric film, e.g. a polyester film. The insulating member may comprise two polymeric films which are joined along a central portion and between which the conductors are sandwiched along respective edge portions. Preferably, in order to accommodate expansions and or contractions of the cable, the insulating member may be provided with pockets, which pockets secure the conductors to the insulating member, the pockets comprising perforations for enabling the conductors to contact the liquid.
