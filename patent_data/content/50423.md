## Description
Dispense unit for powdered or granular materials The invention relates to a dispense unit ,or powdered or granular materials, primarily but not exclusively for use in a beverage vending machine, of the kind in which an appropriate quantity of powdered or granular material is mixed with hot or cold water as required. Previously known dispense units for powdered or granular materials have been of various kinds, for example, of the kind including a screw conveyor for metering a required quantity of the material during a predetermined number of rotations of the screw.Another kind of dispense unit has included a valve element, sometimes constituted by a metallic ball member, for closing an aperture through which the material can fall freely when the valve member has been moved away from its seating. In this case the correct quantity of material has been dispensed by controlling the period of time during which the valve member has been held away from its seat. hen a metallic ball member has been used as the valve element, the means employed for moving it away from its seating has sometimes been constituted by an electric solenoid which when activated has movec sl e ball member against the farce of a spring. Hzve√ße . all such previously known dispense units have suffered from the disadvantage that a time delay has occured during the dispensing operation. In a beverage vending machine this is a particularly serious drawback, especially in a case where a disposable cup or the like is required to stop at a number of stations for its measures of required ingredients. For example, if a serving of corfee with milk and sugar is required, the disposable cup will be required to stop three times for the required powdered coffee, powdered milk and sugar before a measure of hot water is added. Consequently, it is essential that the dispensing of each ingredient should take place as quickly as possible.Furthermore, such previously known dispense units have tended to dribble after having been shut off which has caused the selected beverages to be contaminated and has also resulted in the vending machine becoming contaminated and unhygienic by stray ingredients. The invention as claimed is intended to remedy the above drawbacks. It solves the problem of how to design a dispense unit for powdered or granular materials in which the function of dispensing a measured quantity of material can be carried out in a bare minimum of time. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that the functions of measuring the required quantity of the material and of actually dispensing the measured quantity of material are separated so that, when the dispense unit is used in a beverage vending machine the operation of the machine is not delayed by any delay in the measuring of the required quantity of powdered or granular ingredient for the beverage required. On the contrary, the operation of the vending machine can proceed at a rate which is dependent on the time taken to actually dispense the measured quantity or quantities of the material or materials concerned. In order tllat the invention may be fully understood and readily carried into effect, the same will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a beverage vending machine embodying the invention Figure 2 is a semi diagrammatic view which illustrates the construction of the dispense units for the powdered or granular materials use in the machine and Figure 3 is a sectional view on the line 3 3 in Figure 2 Referring now in particular to Figure 1 of the drawings, the beverage vending machine there illustrated is provided with a magazine of disposable cups, generally indicated 10, and means generally indicated 12 for feeding a cup from the magazine 10 in increments of movement through successive loading stations in which the required powdered or granular materials are to be placed in the cup, that is to say materials such as a powdered concentrate of the required beverage and possibly powdered milk and or sugar.The means for feeding a cup from a magazine of cups in increments of movement through the successive loading stations in turn are here illustrated to be constituted by an endless band or belt 14 which surrounds a plurality of idler rollers 16 and a drive roller 18, the arrangement being such that the endless band or belt has parallel runs 20 moving in one direction and constituting a track 21. When a disposable cup is released from the magazine 10, by means not shown, the cup can fall between said parallel runs of endless band or belt and by virtue of the usual taper of the cup and the appropriate spacing of said runs of band or belt can jam between them as shown in Figure 2 to be carried to the loading stations in turn.On reaching the end of the track, the disposable cup falls down a chute 42 and arrives at a delivery station 44. Means not shown are provided at said delivery station for the charging of the cup with hot water and of course if one of the beverages which can be selected is a cold fruit drink, for example, the machine will additionaily be provided with means for charging a cup with coLd water where appropriate . A sliding window 46 is shown to give access to the delivery station so that when the cup has been charged with water and the pre selected beverage has been produced the user can rase the window and extract the disposable cup containing his pre selected beverage. Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the means for dispensing the required powdered or granular materials into each cup as it passes along the track defined by the parallel runs of endless band or belt 14 are constituted by respective dispense units 22. Each dispense unit includes a material container 24, and a holding chamber generally indicated 26, the holding chamber being constituted by a rigid open bottomed tube 28 and a length of thin walled flexible tubing 30 a lower end of which is usually clamped shut by a clamp 32.Each dispense unit also includes means for displacing a carefully controlled measure of the material from the material container into said holding chamber, these means being shown in figure 2 to be constituted by a screw conveyor 34, and means for opening the underside of said holding chamber when the material is to be dispensed, said means being constituted by means for releasing the cLap 32 so that the measure of material is du.n ed from the holding chamber. tithe means for releasing the clamp 32 so that the measure of the powdered or granular material concerned is dumped from the holding chamber are shown to be constituted by an electric solenoid 36 which when actuated moves against the force of a spring 38 to displace a strong wire element 40 forming one element of a pair of pincer members which form the claap 32. Control meats not shown are provided whereby a user of the vending machine can select a required beverage by pressing an appropriate push button and can also select the addition of a selected additive, such as sugar and or powdered milk, when required. By the pressing of the appropriate push buttons, the progress along the track 21 of the disposable cup in which the beverage required will be served is pre prograraned. In other words the cup is arranged to stop briefly at each loading station where it is to be charged with a powdered or granular material but carries straight on through those loading stations where the powdered or granular material concerned is not required. Similarly, the operation of the appropriate dispense unit or units is pre programmed by the pressing of the push buttons so that the measure of the appropriate powdered or granular material is dumped into the disposable cus concerned as it halts briefly beneath the selected dispense unit or units.However, the arrangement is such that in each case, although the dumping of the material concerned must wait until the disposable cup has arrived beneath the appropriate dispense unit, the means for displacing the required measure of material from the material container into the holding chamber concerned can cornence as soon as the beverage or additive concerned has been selected by the user. Consequently, at each loading station the disposable cup is arranged to pause for a bare minimum of time, that is to say for only the period required for the material in the holding chamber to be dumped into the cup. The displacing of the required measure of material from the material container into the holding chamber may take a longer period with some materials than with others.For example, cocoa takes a longer period than sugar.Consequently, those materials requiring a relatively longer time to measure out into the holding chambers will be located furthest away from the magazine of disposable cups. It has been found that the invention described above, that is to say the dispense unit in which the functions of measuring the required quantity of the material concerned and of actually dispensing the measured quantity of material are separated, has resulted in a significant saving of time in the serving of the selected beverages in a vending machine in wllich dispense units embodying the invention are emt loyed. It has also been found that a dispense unit embodying the invention shuts off cleanly when the measure of material has been dumped.This is in contrast to previously known dispense units which have frequently suffered from the serious drawback that prolonged dribbling of the material after the flow has supposedly been shut off has caused contamination of the selected beverages with unwanted ingredients and has also resulted in the vending machine hecoming contaminated and unhygienic by stray ingredients. Various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the means for displacing a carefully controlled measure of the material from the material container into the holding caber need not b constituted by a screw conveyor. Any other suitable means could be employed and indeed such means could be different within a single machine to suit the different materials requiring to be dispensed . It will also be understood that the means for releasing the clamp by means of which the lower end of the flexible tubing 30 is normally clamped shut could also be different.
