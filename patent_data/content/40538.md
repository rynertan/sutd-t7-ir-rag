# Recoverable plug for sealing a pipeline.

## Abstract
A plug for sealing abandoned pipelines comprises a clos ure member 1 that is acted upon by a biasing means such as a spring 10 contained within the closure member 1 . The biasing means 10 acts on the closure member 1 in such a way that when the plug is inserted within the pipeline the closure member 1 is caused to change in dimension and close the pipeline. The closure member 1 is preferably made from a recoverable material adapted such that recovery also acts to cause the member 1 to change in dimension to close the pipeline. The closure member 1 is coated with an adhe sive 15 which contacts the inner pipeline wall to form a good seal.
