# Absorption heat pump system.

## Abstract
An absorption heat pump system having a generator 3 , a condenser 4 , an evaporator 1 and an absorber 2 connect ed hermetically to form closed cycles for a refrigerant and an absorbent, comprising a control means 21 disposed in the re frigerant passage 8 leading from said condenser 4 to said evaporator 1 and adapted to continuously controlling the temperature or flow rate of the liquid refrigerant, thereby to stabilize the temperature in said evaporator 1 .
