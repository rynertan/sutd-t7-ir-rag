## Description
PAINT STRIPPER COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to stripper compositions for removing siccative coatings. It particularly relates to stable, non volatile aqueous alkaline strippinq compositions for removing siccative coatings such as paint, shellac, varnish, lacquer and the like from wood and metal substrates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Compositions which are effective in removing siccative coatings from a wide variety of substrates, including wood and metals, are known. They find utility in such diverse operations as furniture stripping and similar applications which may be characterized as home restoration operations, as well as in industrial applications, such as in the automotive industry, when it becomes necessary to remove protective siccative coatings from the component metallic parts. The simplest of the stripping compositions comprises an aqueous alkaline solution which is usually employed at high temperatures usually a rolling boil . This is a relatively slow process in which the alkaline base is consumed and contaminants are formed in the composition. An improvement over the use of simple solutions of alkaline bases at higher temperatures has been obtained by adding to the alkaline solution a wetting agent which accelerates the stripping operation by penetrating or permeating the paint films. Additional improvements can be realized by the use of detergents and emulsifiers which further accelerate the stripping process. Although the aforementioned aqueous alkaline coml,osi tions, which contain wetting agents, detergents and emulsifiers and are employed at elevated temperatures and are often characterized as hot stripper compositions , are qenerally effective in removing most siccative finishes, they are ineffective in removing cathodic electrodeposition paints and are not particularly effective in removing certain paints such as acrylic and vinyl paints. It has previously been found that the addition of furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, mixtures of said alcohols, and alkoxylated furfuryl alcohol to such hot stripper compositions results in compositions that are effective in removing acrylic and vinyl paints as well as cathodic electrodeposition paints. However, problems were encountered in the use of such stripping compositions. For example, furfuryl alcohol and water form an azeotrope, the boiling point of which falls within the operative temperature range for the hot stripper compositions. Thus, with continued use, the activator, i.e.the furfuryl alcohol, is lost as it is boiled off, thus requiring either the preparation of a new bath or the continued replacement of the furfuryl alcohol and water. It has been found that the addition of at least two of the following materials tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and ethoxylated materials of the formula R O CEl2CIl2O nEI wherein R is a furfuryl or tetrahydrofurfuryl radical and n has a value from about 0.5 to 10, to an aqueous alkaline stripping bath will provide compositions having increased stripping effectiveness and prolonged bath life when used at elevated temperatures. Preferably, such compositions contain a sequestering agent to tie up magnesium and calcium ions present in hard water, one or more surfactants or wetting agents, and a composition stabilizing agent. Representative of sequestering agents which can be employed in these compositions are hydroxy carboxylic acids such as gluconic, citric, and tartaric acids, aminopolycarboxylic acids such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid, and various commercial preparations such as Belzak AC, sodium alpha glucoheptonate dihydrate. The particular surfactant or wetting agent employed was not critical and amphoteric, nonionic and or anionic surfactants were employed. Preferred surfactants were Miranol JEM concentrate, manufactured by Miranol Chemical Co. and Sulfonate OA 5, manufactured by Cities Service Co. Additional benefits were realized by the use of a composition stabilizing compound which may be regarded as a secondary solvent miscible with water and functions to provide a more stable solution or emulsion which did not separate on standing. Preferred composition stabilizing compounds included methanol, monoethanolamine, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, n butylamine and mixtures thereof. In the actual practice of using these improved activating compositions, aqueous solutions of the activating compositions were first prepared, and when needed such activatina compositions were added to an alkaline solution having a pI of about 9.5 to about 14 . Suitable bases for preparaing these alkaline solutions were the alkaline hydroxides with sodium hydroxide being preferred because of its low cost compared to the others. Examples of these improved activating compositions and their uses are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,366,002, the 002 patent and the information disclosed in this patent is incorporated herein by reference. The compositions described in the 002 patent have eliminated the azeotrope problem inherent in the use of furfuryl alcohol and are effective in the stripping of alkyd, acrylic and cathodic electrodeposited paints. However, these compositions do not retain their activity as long as desired since the activator composition degrades at the elevated temperatures at which the stripping takes place. This requires either the replenishment of the activating composition in the alkaline stripper or the discarding of the entire stripper composition and the preparation of a new batch. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention provides an activating composition to be added to an alkaline stripping solution, which activating composition will not be degraded and will retain its full activity after weeks of continued use under the conditions of hot stripping siccative coatings.

A preferred ratio of the di and tri isopropanolamines is from about 76 to about 98 by weight of di isopropanolamine and from about 0.5 to about 12 by weight of tri isopropanolamine. A preferred activating composition contains in percent by weight i from about 0.1 to about 10 of N phenyl diethanol amine ii from about 0.1 to about 10 of a mixture of di and tri isopropanolamines iii from about 0.1 to about 10t of teLrabydror ur furyl alcohol iv from about 0.1 to about 204 of a compound of the formula RO CH2CH2O nH wherein R is furfuryl and n is about 0.85 to about 1.08 and v from about 0.1 to about 20 of a compound of the formula R O CH2CH2O nH wherein R is tetra hydrofurfuryl and n is about 3 to about 8. In addition to the essential ingredients a and b described above, the aqueous activating compositions of the invention can contain sequestering agents, surfactants, stabilizing agents, and or coupling agents.

A preferred stabilizing agent is tetra ethylene glycol. The invention will become clearer from the examples which follow. These examples are given by way of illustration and are not to be considered as limiting.

While other alkali hydroxides may be used they are too expensive for heavy commercial use. The aqueous alkaline activated stripping compositions are very effective, the compositions containing more activating composition being more effective i.e. causing more rapid stripping. The times needed to effect 100 stripping at 900OF with different v v percentages of the activating composition of EXAMPLE 1 and a 50t sodium hydroxide solution are as follows v v Concentration 1003 Strippi nq Time 0 25 nin. 5 10.5 min. 102 5.5 min. 20 2.5 min.Activating products now on the market require about 4 to 5 times as long to effect 100 stripping under similar conditions. The aqueous alkaline activated stripping compositions retain their activity during use for significantly longer periods of time than those currently on the market.
