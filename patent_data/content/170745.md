# A cartridge for small arms.

## Abstract
A cartridge for use with a revolver, automatic or sub machine gun has a brass casing. The interior of the casing has a substantially planar bottom wall 11 extending radi ally from its flash hole 7 . A primer pocket 6 in the base 4 communicates through the flash hole with the casing interior 19 within which the powder is ignited. A parabolic curved section 12 extends from the planar bottom wall to a sloped wall section 13 . The slope is in the range from substantially 5 to 15 degrees. The casing wall thus narrows forwardly and terminates in an area 14 of substantially uniform or constant thickness within which the bullet B is frictionally retained. With the parabolic curved section, the relocation of forces due to the discharging gases in substan tially in a line which is parallel with the longitudinal axis of the cartridge. The projectile velocity is thus substantially increased without subjecting the cartridge to undesired ex pansion, cracking or distortion. This increases the firepower while eliminating the jamming problems occasionally in curred during the firing of automatic weapons.
