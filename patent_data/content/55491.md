## Description
BALANCING SYSTEM FOR LASER MACHINING DEVICE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a balancing system for a laser machining device which is small in weight, simple in balance adjustment and excellent in operability. Fig. l a shows one example of a conventional laser machining device, with different balancing mechanisms being shown in Figs. l a l c . In these figures, reference numeral 1 designates a light conducting pipe 2, articulation joints 3, a hand piece 4, a balance weight 5, a balance supporting rod and 6, a spring balance mechanism. A laser beam from a laser source not shown is applied to a light conducting path, for instance, of a multi articul√Öation mirror reflection type, as indicated by the arrow in Fig 1 and is propagated in the light conducting pipes 1. During the propagation, the laser beam is repeatedly reflected by mirrors provided in the articulation joints 2, and propagated to the hand piece 3 to irradiate a workpiece not shown .Heretofore, in order to balance the weight of a multi articulation mirror reflection type light conducting path, for instance in a laser machining device, a weight balance system has been employed in which, as shown in Fig. l a , the weight of the light conducting path is balanced with the balance weight which is provided on the opposite side of the stationary fulcrum from the light conducting pipe 1. Alternatively, a spring balance system has been employed in which, as shown in Fig. l b , the weight is balanced by the repulsive force of the spring balance mechanism 6. Sometimes both the weight and spring balance systems are combined, as shown in Fig. l c . The weight balance system is disadvantageous in that, since the weight of the light conducting path is balanced with the weight only, the weight must be considerably heavy, and accordingly the total weight is large and the inertial moment is considerably large. The spring balance system is also disadvantageous in that a large force is exerted on the spring which balances the weight of the system. It is necessary to loosen the spring in order to perform fine adjustment, and due to the large force of the spring it is rather difficult to adjust the balance finely. In the combined weight and spring balance system, the weight is displaced for fine balance adjustment, and the fine adjustment range is increased by increasing the weight of the balancing weight or by increasing the length of the weight supporting rod.Therefore, the weight and spring balance system as shown in Fig. l c suffers from a drawback that the balance mechanism becomes bulky when the fine adjustment range is increased. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a balancing system for a laser machining device which is small in weight, high in operability and simple in fine balance adjustment. Briefly, the present invention employs a spring balance mechanism in combination with a sliding weight on either the supporting rod or on the light conducting pipe itself. Main balancing is performed by the spring balance mechanism, while fine balance adjustment can be performed by adjusting the small sliding weight along the supporting rod or light conducting pipe. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS This invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. l a l c are explanatory diagrams showing examples of conventional laser machining device balancing mechanism Fig. 2 is an explanatory diagram showing one example of a balancing system for a laser machining device according to this invention and Figs. 3 a and b are sectional views showing a fine adjustment weight employed in the balancing system of the invention. DETArLED BESCRIPrTON OF THE INVENTION Fig. 2 shows one example of a balancing system a laser machining device according to this invention. In Fig.2, those components which have been described with reference to Figs. l a l c are therefore similarly numbered. In Fig.2, reference numeral 7 designates a weight for fine adjustment. In a balance system employed in the laser machining device according to this invention, the weight of the light conducting path is balanced mainly with the spring balance mechanism 6, and the fine adjustment of balance is carried out by the fine adjustment weight 7 which is slidably mounted on the balance supporting rod 5 or on the horizontal light conducting pipe 1. The weight 7 is slidable substantially over the entire length of the balance supporting rod 5 or the horizontal light conducting pipe 1, and it is fixed with a bolt, set screw, or the like at a position where proper balance is obtained. Since the main balance is obtained according to the spring balance system and the fine adjustment is carried out according to the sliding weight balance system, the invention is advantageous in at least the following respects. First, since the balance is obtained mainly according to the spring balance system, the required weight of the sliding weight 7 is small. Consequently, the inertial moment during operation is small, the ease of operability is thus increased and the total weight is small, when compared with the device as shown in Fig. l a . Further, the fine adjustment can be achieved merely by sliding the fine adjustment weight 7. The fine adjustment mechanism, employing only the sliding weight, is not only simple to operate but is also simple in construction.Still further, since the fine adjustment weight is mounted on the long balance supporting rod 5 or horizontal light conducting pipe 1, a wide fine adjustment range can be obtained by a light weight. Figs. 3 a and 3 b are sectional views of the fine adjustment weight in the balancing system according to the invention. In these Figures, reference numerals 5, 7 and 8 designate the aforementioned balance supporting rod, fine adjustment weight and a bolt, respectively. The bolt 8 is tapered, and its end portion is threaded. The fine adjustment weight 7 is secured to the balance supporting rod 5 by tightening the bolt 8. After the bolt 8 has been loosened or unscrewed, the fine adjustment weight 7 can be slid along the rod 5 or the horizontal light conducting pipe until the proper balance is obtained, and then the fine adjustment weight 7 is secured by tightening the bolt 8, thereby achieving a fine balance adjustment. The fine adjustment weight 7 can be readily removed from or mounted on the balance supporting rod 5 or the horizontal light conducting pipe 1 by removing the bolt 8 entirely therefrom. Therefore, the number of weights or the size of a single weight can be readily changed, which contributes to an increase in the fine balance adjustment range. The balancing system for the laser machining device according to the invention is applicable to laser knives and to various other kinds of laser machining device.
