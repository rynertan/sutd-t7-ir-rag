# ROTOR HEAD ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
The invention provides a rotor head assembly 40 adapted for detachable mounting upon an upstanding rotat able electromagnet 18 of a decanting centrifuge 10 , said ro tor head assembly comprising an annular support member 46 and a plurality of magnetically attractable open topped tube carriers 43 pivotally suspended from said support mem ber each tube carrier including a tube holding member 50 and a magnet contacting member 51 said tube holding member and magnet contacting member each having an upper end portion independently and pivotally suspended from said annular support member and being adjustably connected to each other at their lower ends for selectively adjusting the maximum angle therebetween for controlling the discharge of fluid from a centrifuge tube supported by said tube holding member during a decanting operation.
