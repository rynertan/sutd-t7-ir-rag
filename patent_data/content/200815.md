# Mounting shaft to pulley formed of sheet metal.

## Abstract
A one piece sheet metal pulley has a support structure for rigidly affixing the pulley to an end of a rotary shaft. The pulley includes a peripheral surface 12 , a web 14 , and a hub 13 integrally formed of a single metal sheet. A plurality of protrusions 15 are raised from the hub 13 , each protru sion 15 being a portion between two spaced slits bent upwards to hold the shaft end 5 . The bent up portion is contiguous with the sheet metal hub 13 at opposite ends of the slits and is raised axially from the hub 13 inter mediate the ends, the protrusions 15 bearing radially against the shaft 5 adjacent the shaft end. A bolt hole 19 is centrally provided in the hub for inserting an axial bolt 18 through the hub 13 and into the shaft 5 , and a rotation preventing means 19 having an eccentric attachment means on the hub 13 resists relative rotation.
