## Description
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention includes biologically active compositions including water solutions of a biologically active macromolecule and a carbohydrate. We have found that the compositions of the invention provide sustained release of growth hormones when administered parenterally as solutions, dispersions and pastes. The invention relates to compositions for parenteral administration comprising a water soluble or water dispersible carbohydrate polymer, or a mixture of carbohydrate polymers, and a biologically active macromolecule, and water, or a buffered solution, or a pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable solvent. The invention includes a method for administering and maintaining blood levels of biologically active macromolecules comprising parenterally administering compositions of the invention. The invention also includes a method for increasing milk production in dairy cows comprising parenterally administering compositions of the invention to the cows. Biologically active macromolecules of the invention include e.g., growth hormones, somatomedins, growth factors, and other biologically active fragments. These macromolecules include growth hormones for example bovine, ovine, equine, porcine, and human growth hormones. However, other biologically active macromolecules may also be used within the scope of the invention, such as insulin. Carbohydrates, such as dextran and starch, have until now been assumed to be inert regarding their capability to adsorb high molecular weight substances such as proteins.As an example of this it may be mentioned that dextran is used for the preparation of covalently crosslinked spheres Sephadex, Pharmacia AB . These spheres are used for purification and for chemical characterization of proteins where very high demands on low unspecific adsorbtions of the proteins to the matrix are needed. However, as described in this invention, when some carbohydrates are in solution, strong and not previously described interactions between carbohydrates and proteins are obtained. These interactions are very strong, and strong dissociating substances in high concentrations are needed to break the interaction between the carbohydrate and the protein. Polymers preferred for use in the invention include carbohydrate polymers such as the dextrans, dextrins, alginates, starches and fractionated starches, glycogen, pullullan, agarose, cellulose, chitosan, carrageenan, and synthetic biopolymers, as well as gums such as xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, gum arabic, tragacanth gum, and karaya gum, derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof.These carbohydrate polymers, many of which are classified as polysaccharides or oligosaccharides or derivatives thereof, have the desirable properties of being inert to biological systems they are well characterized and nontoxic they are excretable from the body by normal routes and, due to their water solubility and dispersion characteristics, they may readily be administered in aqueous compositions. The term water solubility for these polymers is meant to include the range of colloidal solution and dispersions. Solvents suitable for use in the compositions of this invention include phosphate buffered saline PBS which contains NaH2P04.H20 0.025 Mol , Na2HPO4 0.025 mol , and NaCl 0.15 mol which has been adjusted to pH 7.1 andCarbonate Buffer Saline CBS which contains Na2C03 0.025 mol , NaHC03 0.025 mol , and NaCl 0.15 mol which has been adjusted to pH 9.4 and saline alone in combination with other pharmaceutically and pharmocologically acceptable water miscible solvents. Pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable solvents frequently employed in biological preparations for parenteral administrations include a variety of liquid alcohols, glycols, esters, and amides. As such, these solvents find utility in the compositions of this invention. The invention includes a way of preparing such compositions, including the complex formation of a protein to carbohydrate in a water solution, together with hydrophobic or a hydrophilic substance that may interfere with hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions in the complex. Additionally complex formation may be effected by methods already well known in the literature which describes the derivatization of carbohydrates with various hydrophobic or charged moieties. Examples of hydrophobic derivatives can be mentioned such as cholesterol or Cibachrome blue, or charged groups such as sulfate or amino groups. Hence, it is possible to influence complex formation by the use of various hydrophobic and or hydrophilic substances that influence the hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions in the complex during the formation of the complex.Additionally, stabilizers and preservatives such as acids, esters, organic ammonium halides, sulfides, alcohols, amines, anilides or organomercury compounds at concentrations of up to 0.2 on a weight to volume basis may be added to the compositions of the invention to improve their stability. Preferred stabilizers for compositions of the invention include dehydroacetic acid and salts thereof, the sodium salt being most preferred salicylanilide sorbic acid and salts thereof, the potassium salt being most preferred sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate. By the use of detergents which break hydrophobic interactions, it has now been shown that it is this type of interaction which is dominating for some carbohydrates. A complex has, according to this invention, a size below 50 nanometer, but despite this, a complex bound protein can not be detected with the help of antibodies through an ELISA determination. That polyclonal antibodies are not able to be bound to the protein suggests that the protein is hidden by a carbohydrate. It has now, suprisingly, been shown, that despite above mentioned hiding, the protein still has its biological activity, since after injection in an animal, continuous and uniform dissociation of the complex over ten days is obtained.The dissociation in vivo is obtained with the help of the detergent systems within the body, i.e. systems that influence the hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions in the complex. Alternatively one may, when preparing a complex, add such a substance like a detergent to ease the dissociation of the complex. Preferred compositions of the invention are comprised of soluble carbohydrate polymer to biologically active macromolecule ratios on a weight basis of from 0.25 1.0 to lOO.Q l.O. Soluble carbohydrate polymer to solvent ratio will of course vary depending upon the solubility of the carbohydrate and solvent employed. These preferred compositions having soluble carbohydrate polymer to biologically active macromolecule ratios of from 1.0 1.0 to 100 1 may be administered as aqueous pastes or solutions in water or buffered saline solutions. Higher ratios of water soluble polymer may of course also be employed. The quantity of water or buffered saline solution may vary depending upon the carbohydrate polymer and its solubility characteristics, as may the pH of the buffered saline solution. Aqueous compositions of the invention administered in vivo in a pH range of from about pH 3.0 to pH 10.0 having water to carbohydrate polymer ratios of 0.83 to 1 to 4.0 to I have been effective for administering and maintaining increased levels of biologically active macromolecules in vivo. Especially preferred compositions of the invention are with bovine growth hormone, and water, aqueous buffer solution, or saline include dextrin dextran a heteropolysaccharide of glucose, galactose, mannose, glucuronic acid and fucose Biopolymer PS 87 Lever Brothers Company , as described in United States Patent 4,357,423 and mixtures of xanthan gum with locust bean gum. The invention is further illustrated by the following nonlimiting examples. EXAMPLE 1Preparation of an aqueous bovine growth hormone composition A low viscosity corn dextrin 18g , having the properties of being acidic as a 25 dispersion with a viscosity of 50 centipoise at 250C, and bovine growth hormone 0.18g is admixed with 15 ml of carbonate buffer saline, pH 9.4 Na2C03, 0.025 mol NaHC03 0.025 mol and NaCl 0.15 mol until a homogenous paste is obtained. EXAMPLE 2Evaluation of growth hormone compositions of the invention in dairy cows Nine lactating cows are divided into three groups of three. Throughout the test, all cows are fed the same ration of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and dairy concentrate adequate to produce 25 kg to 30 kg of milk per day.

The result shows that only about 5 of the hormone added could be detected.When the detergent Triton X100 is added, in increments, the more detergent, added, the more hormone could be detected. At a detergent concentration of 4 all the added hormone could be detected, which indicates strong complex formation between the protein and the carbohydrate. The detergent Triton X 100 is used in biochemical work where dissociation of strong hydrophobic interactions is needed. If detergents which do not have this capability e.g. TWEEN 80 is added a corresponding dissociation of the complex is not seen. EXAMPLE 9 A mixture prepared by the procedure of Example 8 is kept in physiological buffer PBS for five days without adding any type of detergent, only 1 of the hormone added can be detected on day five. If now a 4 Triton solution is added one may, as was seen in Example 5 detect 100 of the hormone added. Example 10 If the mixture according to Example 8 is kept for four days but with various and successively higher concentrations of Triton X100, the result is that with a concentration of 0.05 , about 5 of the hormone is dissociated and is detected with the ELISA determination. At a concentration of 0.08 , about 15 of the hormone has been released after five days, at the concentration of 0.25 , about 20 of the hormone is dissociated and at a concentration of 1 about 30 of the hormone has been dissociated from the complex. EXAMPLE 11 If the dextran T500 Pharmacia AB, Uppsala with a concentration of 0.35 g ml is used as the carbohydrate, a similar dissociation as described in Example 9 is seen. EXAMPLE 12 If radioctively labelled hormone, is incorporated as described in Example 8 or 11 and the amount of radioactive material is determined after filtration through a 50 nanometer filter, the result is that 50 of the radioactivity passes through the filter. This indicates that despite half of the hormone passing the filter, only 10 of this fraction can be detected by the ELISA method, which means that 90 of the hormone in this fraction is hidden and can not be reached by the antibodies in the ELISA. The result indicates that the hormone is masqued or hidden for detection, since association between the protein and the antibody can not be obtained. EXAMPLE 13 If the mixture according to Example 8 is injected as a single injection to a hypox rat, which has no production of growth hormone, a continuous growth over seven days is seen.In this case the total amount of hormone injected is 2 mg. If the same amount is injected without complex formation with a carbohydrate, the rat shows a rapid growth during the first 24 hours but after this the rat loses weight.
