## Description
PLASTIC METAL LAMINATES, CABLE SHIELDING OR ARMORING TAPES, AND ELECTRICAL CABLES MADE THEREWITH This invention relates in a general aspect to plastic metal laminates comprising at least one metallic substrate having at least one layer of a thermoplastic polymer directly adhered to at least one surface thereof.In anoTher, more particular aspect, this invention relates I to such laminates in which at least one polymer layer in direct contact with the metallic substrate comprises a a random copolymer of ethylene and an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and bears on its surface opposite said metallic substrate a layer b of a blend of either the same or a different ethylene ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer and at least one different olefin polymer resin and II to cable shielding and or armoring tapes and electrical communications cables prepared from such laminates. In the manufacture and use of various laminated or composite articles involving one or more metallic layers or substrates having one or more layers or coatings of a thermoplastic polymer material adhered thereto, an oftentimes controlling factor or consideration governing their suitability for various end use applications is the degree of adhesion as between the various polymeric and metallic layers in such laminated or composite article. A particular example of an area in which the adhesion between the various layers in a plastic metal composite article is of great concern can be found in U.S. Patent 4,132,857 wherein the need for improved adhesion as between the polyethylene insulation jacketing material and the metal sheath in electrical cable constructions is discussed.More specifically, such patent proposes to improve the adhesion between said polyethylene jacketing material and said metal sheath by using, in place of the more conventionally employed ethylene acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymer adhesive layer, a coextruded dual film laminate comprising 1 a first film layer of an ethylene acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymer or known ionomer salts thereof and 2 a second film layer of either polyethylene, an ethylene acrylyl ester copolymer or an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. While it appears that the above discussed approach of U.S. Patent 4,132,857 may be capable of providing some measure of improved jacketing resin adhesion in certain instances when measured at room temperature, such an improvement in room temperature adhesion performance does not appear to be consistently achieved across the full range of possible jacketing resin second film layer combinations. See, for example, the data summarized in the hereinafter presented working examples. Moreover, it has also been found That even when good room temperature jacketing resin adhesion is obtained e.g., either by the above discussed dual film layer approach of U.S.Patent 4,132,857 or via a monolayer ethylene acrylic or methyacrylic acid copolymer coated metal shielding tape approach , such adhesion value can oftentimes be dramatically less when measured at high and or low adhesion testing temperatures. Thus, in view of the fact that various plastic metal composite articles or laminates can reasonably be expected to be installed and or otherwise used e.g., as electrical communications cables as metal plastic metal laminates for potential use as electrical appliance housings, in heating ducts, in various automotive applications, etc. at temperatures substantially above or below normal room temperature e.g., 230C , it would be highly desirable to provide a means of improving the high and or low temperature adhesion as between metal substrates and olefin polymer outer coating or inner core layers in such plastic metal composite articles or laminates. This invention resides in a plastic metal laminate comprising at least one metallic substrate having directly adhered to at least one surface thereof a first thermoplastic polymer layer of a random copolymer of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer and having adhered to said first polymer layer, on the surface of such first polymer layer opposite said metallic substrate, a second thermoplastic polymer layer comprising a polymer blend of a random copolymer of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and at least one ethylenic olefin polymer resin. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention takes the form of a plastic metal laminate e.g., a plastic metal laminate, a plastic metal plastic laminate, or a metal plastic metal laminate, such as are used as cable shielding and or armoring tapes, etc. comprising at least one metallic substrate having directly adhered to at least one side thereof a first thermoplastic polymer layer of a random copolymer of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer and having adhered to said first polymer layer, on the surface of such polymer layer opposite said metallic substrate, a second thermoplastic polymer layer comprising a polymer blend of a random copolymer of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and at least one ethylenic olefin polymer resin. Further, in another aspect, the present invention takes the form of a more finished plastic metal composite article such as, for example, an electrical cable, a formable and or structural metal plastic metal laminate, etc., which further comprises at least one olefin polymer layer e.g., such as a central core layer in said metal plastic metal laminate or as an outer insulating jacketing resin layer in said electrical cable which is directly adhered to a layer of the aforementioned polymer blend.Thus, in one of These latter instances, an electrical cable is provided having improved high and or low temperature structural integrity which comprises 1 a core including at least one insulated conductor 2 a shield or armor tape surrounding said core, said shield or armor tape being composed of the above defined laminate comprising the metal strip having directly adhered to at least one surface Thereof the random copolymer layer and the polymer blend layer, and 3 an outer plastic jacketing resin surrounding said cable shielding tape and being directly adhered to the indicated polymer blend layer. Similarly, in another of these latter instances, a metal plastic metal laminate is provided which also has improved high and or low temperature structural integrity, said laminate comprising two metallic sheets or substrates sandwiching an inner olefin polymer core layer and having interposed between each of the two major surfaces of the core layer and the adjacent metallic substrates a layer of the hereinbefore described multiple layered thermoplastic adhesive with the polymer blend layers directly adhered to said olefin polymer core layer and with the random copolymer layers being directly adhered to their corresponding adjacent metallic substrate. As used herein, low temperature structural integrity or adhesion is evaluated by measuring the 900 peel strength of the laminate of concern at a testing temperature of 120C Similarly, high temperature structural integrity or adhesion is determined by measuring the 900C peel strength at a testing temperature of 710F. Further, it should be understood that when random copolymers of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid are referred to it is intended to include therewith the known partially or fully neutralized versions thereof which are commonly referred to in the art as ionomers . In addition, it should also be understood that, when improved high and or low temperature adhesion or structural integrity is referred to herein, it is meant that the high and or low temperature a adhesion between the olefin polymer core or surface layer or layers and the metal substrate or substrates of the metal olefin polymer laminate or composite article involved is improved by virtue of the use of the abovedescribed multilayered adhesive system a relative to corresponding adhesion provided by the use of a single layer of a random ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer as the adhesive therein and b relative to the use of a two layered adhesive system e.g., a coextruded two layer film having a random ethylene carboxylic acid metal substrate contacting layer and a different olefin polymer layer contacting the olefin polymer substrate of the laminate or composite involved. Plastic metal laminates or composite articles to which the present invention is applicable include any such laminate or article in which it is desired to adhere one or more metal sheets or substrates to one or more layers or substrates of an olefin polymer not typically exhibiting very good adhesion to such a metallic sheet or substrate.Thus, the present invention is applicable where it is desired to adhere such an olefin polymer as an outer coating layer on one or both sides of a single metal sheet or substrate such as, for example, in the case of a cable shielding and or armoring tape per se or in the case of an olefin polymer jacketed electrical communications cable utilizing one or more metallic shields or armors formed from such a cable shielding tape as well as in the case of other olefin polymer coated metal materials, such as are used, for example, in flexible packaging applications, coated structural or building panel applications and the like.Similarily, the present invention is also applicable where it is desired to adhere two or more metal sheet or substrates to a common olefin polymer sheet, substrate or core layer such as, for example, in the case of structural or formable metal plastic metal composite articles or laminates having a central core layer of the aforementioned type of olefin polymer adhesively bonded to, and sandwiched between, two outer metallic sheets or skins. The metallic substrate e.g., sheets, strips, etc. employed in the practice of the present invention will typically have a thickness of from 0.2 to 25 mils more preferably from 2 to 15 mils and can be composed of a wide variety of metallic materials such as, for example, aluminum, aluminum alloys, alloy clad aluminum, copper, surface modified copper, bronze, steel, tin free steel, tin plate steel, aluminized steel, aluminum clad steel, stainless steel, copper clad stainless steel, copper clad low carbon steel, terne plate steel, galvanized steel, chrome plated or chrome treated steel, lead, magnesium, tin and The like. Such metals can, of course, be surface treated or have conversion coatings on the surface thereof if desired. Particularly preferred metallic substrates for use herein include those composed of chrome chrsme oxide coated steel also commonly referred to in the art as tin free steel , stainless steel, aluminum and copper. Thermoplastic polymers suitable for us a s the metal contacting layer in the practice of the present invention include the known normally solid random copolymers of a major proportion of ethylene with a minor proportion e.g., typically from 1 to 30, preferably from 2 to 20, percent by weight based upon the weight of such copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer.Specific examples of such suitable ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids which term includes mono and polybasic acids, acid anhydrides, and partial esters of polybasic acids, as well as the various metallic salts thereof are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, maleic anhydride, monomethyl maleate, monoethyl maleate, monomethyl fumarate, monoethyl fumarate, tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether acid maleate, or ethylene glycol monophenyl ether acid maleate. The carboxylic acid monomer is preferably selected from a,ss ethylenically unsaturated mono and polycarboxylic acids and acid anhydrides having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule and partial esters of such polycarboxylic acid wherein the acid moiety has at least one carboxylic acid group and the alcohol moiety has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.Such copolymers may consist essentially of ethylene and one or more of such ethylenically unsaturated acid or anhydride comonomers or can also contain small amounts of other monomers copolymerizable with eThylene. Thus, the copolymer can contain other copolymerizable monomers including esters of acrylic acid, methyacrylic acid and the like. Random copolymers of such type and methods of making them are readily known in the art. Especially preferred ethylene ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymers for use as the metal substrate contacting layer in the present invention are the normally solid random copolymers of ethylene with from 2 to 15 weight percent of acrylic, methacrylic or crotonic acid especially acrylic acid such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,520,861 and 3,239,370 and the known ionomer salts thereof. The thickness of the aforementioned ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer metal contacting layer employed in the practice of the present invention is not particularly critical. However, as a general rule, each such layer will have a thickness of from 0.1 to 10 mils and preferably from 0.3 to 2.5 mils. As has been noted, the second required thermoplastic polymer layer employed in the present invention is composed of a blend of 1 a random copolymer of a major portion of ethylene with a minor proportion of at least one ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer and 2 at least one ethylenic olefin polymer material. The ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer component of such blend layer is generally selected from the same class of normally solid random copolymers as have been hereinbefore described for use in the aforementioned metal contacting copolymer layer and, in a given instance, such ethylene carboxylic acid blend layer component can be the same or different from that employed in said metal contacting layer. As a rule, however, it is generally preferable that the ethylene carboxylic acid component of said blend layer have a somewhat smaller portion of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymerized therein than is the case for the ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer employed in said metal contacting layer. Thus, for example, when an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer having an acrylic acid content of 6 percent by weight is employed in the metal contacting layer, it is generally preferred to use an ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer in the blend layer having a smaller amount of carboxylic acid monomer copolymerized therein such as, for example, an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer having an acrylic acid content of about 3 percent by weight. The ethylenic olefin polymer material employed in the aforementioned polymer blend layer can suitably be any normally solid ethylenic olefin polymer which is reasonably compatible with the ethylene unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer component of such blend layer and with the olefin polymer layer to which said blend layer is ultimately to be adhered.However, as a general rule it is typically preferred to use the various known ethylene homopolymers e.g., low, medium and high density polyethylenes , copolymers of a major proportion of ethylene with a minor proportion of known copolymerizable monomers such as higher e.g., C3 to about C12 a olefins, ethylenically unsaturated ester monomers e.g., vinylacetate, ethyl acrylate, etc. and graft modified versions of such homopolymers and copolymers e.g., grafted with acrylic acid, maleic anhydride, etc. as the other olefin polymer component of such polymer blend layer in the practice of the present invention. The relative proportions of the two required polymer components i.e., the random copolymer and the ethylenic olefin polymer material in the aforementioned polymer blend layer can be varied fairly broadly with the random copolymer generally constituting from 5 to 7t weight percent of the subject polymer blend and with the ethylenic olefin polymer component generally constituting from 30 to 95 weight percent of such polymer blends. Preferably, however, The random copolymer is employed in an amount constituting from 20 to 70 especially from 30 to 70 weight percent of the polymer blend layer and the ethylenic polymer component preferably constituting from 30 to 80 especially from 30 to 70 weight percent of the polymer blend. The thickness of the indicated polymer blend layer is not particularly critical to the invention.However, as a general rule, such layer will typically have a thickness of from 0.1 to 10 mils and will preferably have a thickness of from 0.3 to 2.5 mils. In the practice of the present invention, the above described multiple layered adhesive film system can be applied to a metallic substrate in any convenient fashion. Thus, for example, conventional extrusion coating techniques may be employed to apply said adhesive layers to a select metallic substrate and, in such event, application can be accomplished either and more preferably as a single extrusion coating operation using known coextrusion equipment and techniques or as a multiple step operation in which the various polymer layers to be employed are each individually applied in separate extrusion coating operations.Alternatively, conventional film lamination techniques can also be suitably employed to adhere the noted multiple layered adhesive film system to the desired metallic substrate and, in such event, multiple lamination steps applying the desired individual layers as separate monolayer films can be employed or, more preferably, as a single lamination operation using a previously coextruded film of the desired multilayered adhesive system. Naturally, a combination of conventional coextrusion and film lamination technologies can be employed to provide the ultimately desired composite articles in a given instance. Thus, for example, when a metal plastic metal laminate is to be prepared, it may be desirable to first coextrude a composite film having a structure such as multiple layer adhesive olefin polymer core multiple layer adhesive and to thereafter film laminate such composite film to two outer skin layers of the desired metallic sheet material. Olefin polymer materials to which the polymer blend layer s of the above described multiple layered adhesive film system is ultimately to be adhered in the desired composite article or structure e.g., as olefin polymer jacketing resins in electrical cable structures, as olefin polymer core layers in metal plastic metal laminates, and the like include those hereinbefore described for use as the ethylenic olefin polymer component in the polymer blend layer of the subject multiple layered adhesive film system.Preferred olefin polymers for such polymer core, jacketing resin, etc. usage typically include the various ethylene homopolymers and copolymers of a major proportion of ethylene with a minor proportion of higher e.g.,C3 C12 a olefin monomers and vinyl ester monomers such as vinyl acetate and lower alkanol esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid, with the ethylene homopolymers i.e., low, medium or high density polyethylene and the ethylene higher a olefin copolymers being particularly preferred in certain end use applications. As has been previously alluded to, the present invention makes possible the preparation of various metal plastic composite articles or laminates, which are of generally known types such as, for example, olefin polymer jacketed electrical or communications cables structural and or formable metal olefin polymer metal laminates etc. but which have improved structural integrity at high e.g., 71 C and or low e.g., at 120C temperatures relative to their known prior art counterparts.Such composite articles or laminates, when subjected to a 900 peel test in accordance with the standard test procedure ASTM D 1876 as herein described should exhibit a peel strength of greater than 0.89 kg cm preferably greater than 1.79 kg cm and most preferably greater than 2.33 kg cm at a low temperature of 120C after aging, and a peel strength of greater than 1.79 kg cm and preferably 2.33 kg cm of example width at a high temperature of 600C after aging. More specifically, the plastic metal laminate of the invention when utilized with another olefin polymer such as is used, for example, a cable jacket exhibits the above mentioned improved 900 peel strength as between the interfaces between the first random copolymer layer and the other olefin polymer of the cable jacket for example . Such increased peel strength being obtained as opposed to directly adhering the first random copolymer layer of the laminate of the invention as the other olefin polymer layer. The preparation and use of such laminates or composite articles in accordance with the present invention are generally accomplished in the conventional fashion with the beneficial exception that notably improved high and or low temperature structural integrity and or performance characteristics are obtained. The present invention is further illustrated by, but is not to be understood as being in any way limited to, the following detailed examples thereof in which all parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated.Example 1 In this example, a 2.3 mil 58 micron thick two layer adhesive film is laminated to one side of a 6 mil 152 micron thick sheet of electrolytic chrome chrome oxide coated steel ECCS and the resulting laminate is then compression molded to a 75 mil 1.9 mm thick sheet of a telephone cable jacketing resin composition composed of a high molecular weight low density polyethylene having a melt index of 0.45 and a density of 0.932 g cc and containing 2.6 weight percent carbon black to thereby form an ECCS 2 layer adhesive film jacketing resin laminate sample.The resulting laminate sample is then cut into 1 inch 2.54 cm wide, 3 inch 7.62 cm long strips and some of such strips are subjected to 900 peel testing in accordance withASTM D 1876 except that a two inch 5.08 cm per minute crosshead speed is employed, conditioning is for 12 to 48 hours in 50 percent relative humidity air at 730F 230C , the bonded and unbonded lengths of the polymer layer are about 3 inches 7.62 cm each and testing is performed on at least 3 test specimens instead of ten at various temperatures in order to determine the initial adhesion values thereof at such testing temperatures.The remaining 1 inch 2.54 cm wide sample specimens are immersed i.e., aged in water at 1400F 600C for one week, allowed to equilibrate and dry in 50 percent relative humidity, 730F 230C air overnight and then are also subjected to 900 peel testing as described above at various temperatures in order to determine the adhesion value for such aged specimens at the indicated testing temperatures. For testing at other than room temperature, the test specimen is placed in the bottom of an environmental chamber for a minimum of 30 minutes at the test temperature to be employed. The test specimen is then placed in the holding fixture and, after re equilibration for 2 minutes, the peel adhesion is determined. The two layer adhesive film employed in the preparation of the aforementioned laminate samples is a 1 1 layer thickness ratio film in which one layer is composed of a random ethylene acrylic acid EAA copolymer 6 weight percent acrylic acid based upon the copolymer weight and melt index 5.5 and in which the other layer is composed of polymer blend of 1 60 weight percent based on blend weight of a conventional low density polyethylene resin having a melt index of 2 and a density of 0.921 g cc and 2 40 weight percent based on the polymer blend weight of a random ethylene acrylic acid EAA copolymer having an acrylic acid content of 3 weight percent based upon such EAA copolymer and a melt index of 11.0.In the preparation of such samples, the indicated two layer film is laminated by preheating the metal for one minute in a circulating air oven heated to 3000F 1490C and by then pulling the preheated metal sheet and the indicated two layer film the EAA non blend layer being in direct contact with the metal surface through a set of rubber nip rolls. The resulting laminate is then post heated for 1 minute in a circulating air oven heated to 3000F 1490C . In the compression molding operation to form the aforementioned ECCS 2 layer adhesive jacketing resin laminate sample, a platen press is employed, the above described ECCS 2 layer adhesive film laminate is placed in contact with the indicated jacketing resin sheet in such press the blend layer of the adhesive film being in direct contact with the jacketing resin sheet and compression molding is accomplished at 2300C and about 15 psig 105 kg cm2 for three minutes. The resulting laminate is then cooled to room temperature in the platen press, removed from the press and subsequently cut into the aforementioned 1 inch 2.54 cm wide specimens and tested in the manner hereinbefore indicated. For comparison purposes, a similar laminate i.e., Control 1 is prepared and tested in which a single 2.3 mil 58 micron thick monolayer EAA copolymer film composed of a major proportion of ethylene and 6 weight percent acrylic acid content only is employed in place of the above noted two layer adhesive film system. The adhesion testing results for each type of laminate are summarized in Table I below.

From the results in Table I, it is seen that while the Control 1 laminate exhibits very good adhesion values at room temperature, such adhesion values are dramatically reduced when measured at the low i.e., 120C or high i.e., 600C and 710C adhesion testing temperatures In contrast, even though the adhesion values for the Example 1 laminate are somewhat reduced at the elevated test temperatures i.e., relative to the room temperature test values , it is nonetheless still seen that the Example 1 laminate exhibits substantially higher adhesion values at low and high temperature than Control 1 comparative laminate.Example 2 Example 1 is repeated except that another jacketing resin composition composed of a high molecular weight low density polyethylene having a melt index of 0.25, a density of 0.932 g cc and containing 2.6 weight percent carbon black, is employed in place of the jacketing resin composition of Example 1. Three additional laminates i.e., Controls 2A, 2B and 2C are prepared for comparative purposes using the above described jacketing resin but using a different type of adhesive film in place of the two layered adhesive film of Examples 1 and 2 laminate.Specifically, a 2.3 mil 58 micron thick monolayer film of the hereinbefore discussed 6 weight percent acrylic acid AA content EAA random copolymer is employed as the adhesive film layer in the Control 2A laminate. In the Control 2B laminate, the adhesive film employed is a 2.3 mil 58 micron thick 1 1 layer thickness ratio 2 layer film in which the metal contacting layer is composed of the aforementioned 6 weight percent AA content random EAA copolymer and in which the jacketing resin contacting layer is composed of the low density polyethylene resin which was employed as one of the components of the Example 1 and 2 blend layers.In the Control 2C laminate, the adhesive film employed is a 2.3 mil 58 micron thick 1 1 layer thickness ratio 2 layer film in which the metal contacting layer is once again composed of the aforementioned 6 weight percent AA content random EAA copolymer and in which the jacketing resin contacting layer is composed of the 3 weight percent AA content random EAA copolymer which was employed as one of the components of the Example 1 and 2 blend layers. The adhesion value results for the Example 2 laminate and for the various comparative laminates are summarized in Table II below.

As can be seen from the results in Table II, the Example 2 laminate exhibits notably better high and low temperature values than all three of the comparative laminate samples.Example 3 Example 2 is repeated except that the polymer blend layer of the 2 layer adhesive film system i.e., the layer ultimately adhered to the jacketing resin sheet is composed of a blend of a 80 weight percent based on the blend weight of a low pressure process linear low density polyethylene having a melt index of 1.0 and a density of 0.9219 g cc with b 20 weight percent based upon the blend of the 3 weight percent AA content random EAA copolymer component employed in theExample 1 and 2 blend layers. For comparative purposes, another laminate Control 3 is prepared in the same fashion except that the jacketing resin contacting layer of the two layer adhesive film is composed solely of the aforementioned linear low density polyethylene component of the Example 3 blend layer in place of the Example 3 blend layer itself. The adhesion value results for these two laminate samples are summarized in Table III below.

As can be seen from the results in Table III, the laminate of Example 3 employing the two layer adhesive film having the indicated polymer blend jacketing contacting layer exhibits notably better 100F 120C adhesion than does the Control 3 laminate in which the 3 weight percent AA containing EAA polymer component is omitted from the jacketing resin contacting layer.Examples 4 9 Example 2 is again repeated except that the blend layer of the two layer adhesive film of Example 2 is replaced by a series of different blend layers as indicated in Table IV below. In addition, another laminate sample i.e.,Control 4 is prepared for comparative purposes in which the non EAA component of the Example 4 9 blend layers i.e., conventional low density polyethylene having a melt index of 0.7 and a density of 0.921 g cc is used as the sole constituent of a layer. The results of the adhesion evaluations for these various laminate samples are summarized in TableIV below. Also presented again in Table IV for comparative purposes are the results for the Control 2A and Control 2C laminates in which the EAA components of the blend layers of Examples 4 6 and 7 9, respectively1 are employed as the sole constituent of a non blend layer used in place of the blend layers of such examples.

As can be seen from the results in Table IV, the blend layer laminates of Examples 4 9 exhibited better 600C and 71 C adhesion values than is obtained using either of the blend layer components alone. Compare the 600C and 710C values for Examples 4 9 with those of Controls 4 and 2A and compare the 600C and 710C values for Examples 7 9 with those of Controls 4 and 2C.Examples 10 15 Example 2 is again repeated except that the blend layer of the two layer adhesive film of Example 2 is replaced by those indicated in Table V below. In addition, comparative laminate samples i.e., Controls 5 and 6 are prepared and tested in which a non blend layer composed solely of the non EAA component of the Example 10 15 blend layers are employed in place of the blend layers of said examples. The results of the adhesion evaluations for these various laminates are summarized in Table V below along with a restatement of the results for the Control 2C laminate discussed in Example 2.

Compare 710C values for Examples 10 12 relative to those ofControls 5 and 2C and compare the 710C values forExamples 13 15 relative to those of Controls 6 and 2C. Examples 16 23 Example 2 is again repeated except that the blend layers of the two layer adhesive films employed are as indicated in Table VI. In addition, the results for comparative laminate samples are also summarized in Table VI in which non blend layers are employed in place of the blend layers of the examples, said non blend layers being composed solely of the individual components of the blend layers of the examples.
