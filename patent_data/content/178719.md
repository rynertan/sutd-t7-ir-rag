# Optical device.

## Abstract
In an optical device an objective 11 can be moved relative to a frame 1 along its optical axis 13 in parallel guide means 3, 5 by means of an electro magnetic actuating device. The actuating device comprises first actuat ing means 21 connected to the frame and second actuating means 23 connected to the objective 11 and which cooperate with said first actuating means via an air gap 25 . When used as a focussing device in an optical disc player, the reactive forces on the first means may generate mecha nical vibration in the player which can degrade tracking and thereby increase the risk of cross talk between adjacent tracks. To reduce vibration, the first actuating means 21 are arranged in a mount 27 which is supported by a leaf spring shaped damping element 29 which is secured to the frame 1 .
