## Description
This invention relates to the generation of electrical energy by changing the magnitude of magnetic flux in a generator without changing its direction through the use of unique and complementary stator and rotor configurations. By varying the reluctance or permeability of the magnetic circuit, the magnetic flux therein changes with respect to time, thereby generating an electrical current in an associated electrical conductor. The generator of the present invention is based upon the same laws of electromagnetism utilized in con ventional generators, but it is different in its con figuration and mode of operation. Most prior generators are characterized by relative motion between a coil of wire and a magnetic field such that the wire cuts through the lines of force of the magnetic field to generate electricity in the coil. This requires electrical windings on a rotor, the use of slip rings or brushes to accommodate the rotation of the windings, and the maintenance of a rotating electrical connec tion. Some of the problems associated with such a design include the continuous attention required by slip rings or brushes, and the serious operational hazards arising from the continuous arcing and sparking as the rotor contacts move past the stationary brush. Slip rings and brushes also degrade operational efficiency through electric power loss from the electrical resistance of the brush contact, and through mechanical friction loss from the drag of the brushes on the rotor. The presence of windings on the rotor also significantly increases the weight or mass of the rotor, necessitating slower rotational speeds and more energy from the prime mover. Still further, the constant rotation and heating of the coils causes them to fati gue and fail with time. Some prior generators function without slip rings and brushes, but have other inherent limitations not found in the more common generator designs. For example, the inductor alternator varies magnetic path induction by means of a wireless toothed rotor. The field is maintained by electromagnets on the stator, and the armature coils are also mounted on the stator. The inductor alternator has not found widespread acceptance since it is more bulky and less efficient than more tra ditional generator types. More recent solutions to the slip ring brush problem have been found by mounting permanent magnets, rather than electromagnets, on the rotor. This elimina tes the need for rotating electrical connections, saves the electrical power otherwise expended in exciting the field, lessens the amount of internal heat generation, and increases power density. However, such permanent magnet generators are severely limited in application since they have no viable means for controlling voltage output with changes in load. They are further severely limited in rotor speed and size because the magnets do not have great structural strength and cannot withstand high inertial forces. In addition, assembly of large machines entails binding together many small magnets whose fields are in opposition, followed by installation of a large magnetized rotor in an iron based alloy stator. The huge magnetic forces involved in these assembly operations make large scale production and maintenance of such ma chines very difficult time consuming, and costly. Further aspects of prior generators which detract from performance include full reversal of the magnetic field, resulting in hysteresis loss, eddy current loss, and heat production and non uniformity of torque, producing higher harmonics which reduce output quality and efficien cy. At constant demand, non uniform torque results from the discreteness of the field poles and the magnetomotive force they produce. The generator embodying the present invention is capable of incorporating virtually all of the positive characteristics of all previous generator types including but not limited to those discussed herein. Further, it is capable of eliminating or mitigating many of the problems associated with such generator designs. The present invention is directed to a variable magnetic reluctance generator. A known reluctance generator is disclosed in DE A 3420598. According to the present invention, there is pro vided a variable magnetic reluctance generator as defined in claim 1. More particularly, the variable magnetic reluctance generator embodying the invention generally comprising a stator having a plurality of pairs of spaced magnetic poles of opposite polarity. Like polarity poles are adjacent one another to define a gap having all poles of the same polar ity on the same side, and permanent magnet means provide an essentially uniform magnetic field intensity along the length of the gap. The opposite polarity poles are connect ed by a magnetically permeable path that is surrounded by a stator winding. The rotor has alternating segments of high and low magnetic permeability and these segments move through the gap between the opposite polarity poles, which changes the magnetic permeability between them. This causes variations in the magnetic flux in the magnetically permeable path, which induces an electrical current in the surrounding stator winding. Output voltage may be con trolled by auxiliary field coils on the stator which add to, or substract from, the permanent magnet produced flux as the load changes and or by switches on the armature coils which, depending on demand, connect more of fewer coil turns in series with the output terminals. The generator embodying the present invention utilizes stationary permanent magnets, stationary armature windings, stationary auxiliary field control windings, and a rotor with no windings. Motion of the rotor varies the reluctance of the magnetic circuit and produces an altera tion in the magnetic flux passing through the armature. The physical qualities of the generator include no slip rings or brushes and fewer moving parts, which made it more reliable, easier to service, quieter, and eliminates arcing or sparking. Similarly, since it may be smaller and lighter, it is adaptable for applications with limited space, and has an enhanced portability. Its operational characteristics include the use of a smaller prime mover to obtain the same power output, higher efficiency, lower operating costs, higher reliability, lower initial cost, and quieter operation. The unique design permits ready access to the electrical conductors making them easier to cool and service. The conductors are also stationary, making them compatible with gas or liquid cooling. Since the magnetic field is supplied by one or more permanent magnets, the machine embodying the invention is capable of having virtually all of the advantages of perma nent magnet rotor generators, including higher efficiency due in large part to the elimination of the primary field current , brushless rotor, improved power density, and decreased heat production. Because of the unique design, however, it does not have the drawbacks of typical perma nent magnet machines. Higher speeds and larger rotors are possible and ruggedness and reliability are improved be cause the magnets are not mounted on the rotor. Hysteresis and eddy current loss will be less since the flux variation can be approximately half as great. Production and main tenance are more practical since small magnets can be used separately. In addition, more efficient use is made of the magnet material by greater flux squeezing and by multiple path uses of the same magnet. Generators relying upon permanent magnets for excitation and operation may suffer from a drop in voltage as current is drawn out. This problem arises from the inability to control the magnetic field to compensate for the voltage drop. However, the generator embodying the present invention uses permanent magnets and voltage con trol, which also assists in suppressing voltage surges or spikes. The generator embodying the present invention is capable of having all of the advantages of the traditional inductor generator, but will be significantly more effi cient and less bulky. Utilization of the essentially continuous nature of the field pole strength next to the air gap, along with incorporation of the properly shaped and spaced permeable portions on the rotor, can result in more uniform torque and a voltage output virtually free of higher harmonic distortion. Further, armature reaction does not result in localized distortions of the air gap field. Rather, it occurs as a global effect on the entire cross section of the magnetic flux path, and as a result, is easier to analyze, detect, and correct. In addition, the device may be operated as a single phase or poly phase system making it more versatile for sophisticated application, including co generation.

Fig. 10 is a graph representing possible posi tions of the rotor segments as a function of rotation of the rotor and linear position along the rotor axis for the alternate embodiment of Fig. 9. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the variable reluctance generator embodying the present invention generally includes a stator portion 1 and a rotor portion 2. Each of these portions is discussed in detail. Referring to the stator, it includes a plura lity of stator cores 3 arranged together to generally form a toroid. Each stator core is made of highly per meable magnetic material and is generally C shaped, though it may be any shape, to define an opening between opposing core ends 3A, 3B. The cross sectional con figuration of each stator core is shown rectangular but may be varied. Each of the stator core ends has a high strength permanent magnet 6A, 6B, such as, but not limited to, one made of rare earth cobalt or neodymium ferrite, attached thereto and in magnetic circuit therewith. The magnets are oriented to define an annular air gap 7 between their respective opposing pole faces 8A, 8B, with opposite polarity poles facing each other across the gap thereby defining a flux path F through the stator core. The shape, size, number, material, and properties of the magnets as well as their position on the stator core may vary depending on waveform and magnitude of electrical output desired as well as on other design considerations. The pole faces 8A, 8B of the opposing polarity spaced magnets 6A, 6B are aligned with all pole faces being on the circumference of a circle and being copla nar to define a gap 7 having a constant radial distance R from the stator axis 11. Like polarity poles are adjacent one another on the same side of the air gap 7, forming a substantially continuous and smooth pole surface, i.e. a surface without discontinuities around all 360 of the gap length. The surface area of each of the individual pole faces 8A, 8B making up the con tinuous pole surface is substantially the same. A stator winding 5 of electrically conductive wire preferably surrounds each stator core. The ends of the various windings are electrically connected in a predetermined manner, i.e. series, parallel, delta, etc. to provide an electrical output having the desired pha ses, currents, voltages, and waveforms. The number of turns per winding and the nature of the interconnections from winding to winding, if any, may be changed to accommodate the desired electrical output charac teristics. Space limitations do not severely limit the number of turns that can be wound around the cores. This can increase voltage considerably. The peripheral location of the coils on the stator cores makes cooling easier, and this may be enhanced by using the rotating shaft or rotor to convect cooling air across the coils. Likewise, serviceability is improved through easier access to the coils. The rotor portion 2 of the generator comprises a disk 12 mounted for rotation on a shaft 13 that is perpendicular to the disk surface and colinear with the axis 11 of the stator portion 1. The axis of the stator portion coincides with the center of the circle formed by the pole faces 8 of the stator magnets. The disk is made of a material having a low magnetic permeability, such as but not limited to aluminum. Inserts of a material having a high magnetic permeability 14 are disposed in the rotor at a radial distance equal to the radial distance R from the axis of the stator to the air gap 7 as defined by the pairs of spaced magnetic pole faces of opposite polarity. As shown, the inserts extend through the entire width of the disk 12, as measured axially, though they may extend more or less than the width of the disk. The shape of each of the higbly permeable segments 14 and each of the spaces 14A of low magnetic permeability between adjacent highly permeable segments both preferably correspond to the surface area and shape of each of the adjacent pole sur faces that together define the air gap but they may also be of different shape and spacing. The surface portion of each of the high and low permeability magnetic segments of the rotor may or may not be substantially parallel to the pole faces of each of the poles. These surface portions do not have to be planar, nor do the corresponding surface portions of the stator. The rotor shaft is journaled by known means and connected to a prime mover not shown such as a steam turbine, diesel engine, etc., to rotate the rotor disk. As it is rotated, the alternating segments of high and low magnetic permeability 14, 14A move through the length of the air gap 7 between the opposite polarity poles of each pair of opposing magnets 6A, 6B, whilst remaining within this air gap. As the magnetic permeability in the gap changes, the permeance of the flux path F will cyclically alternate between high and low values. Thus, the magnetic flux in each of the individual stator cores 3 will also cyclically alternate between high values when the highly permeable magnetic material is present in the associated gap to low values when the low permeability magnetic material is present in the associated gap. This variation in flux in the stator core generates a voltage in the asso ciated surrounding stator winding 5. Voltage can be controlled by varying a DC current in coil 21 which may be located anywhere along the magnetic flux path. The primary flux from the per manent magnet is then enhanced or reduced sufficiently to raise or lower output voltage amplitude. Alternately, voltage may be controlled by a group of switches not shown connecting a variable number of armature turns 5 directly to the output terminals. The DC voltage or opening and closing of the switches may be controlled using conventional voltage regulation moni tors, control techniques, and circuitry. The rotor may be lightweight, requiring less energy and time during transients to bring it up to operating speed. Frictional and air drag loss are reduced, and higher speeds, and hence higher voltages, are more easily obtained. In addition, proper design of the permeable rotor sections 14 and 14A can produce essentially any desired waveform, virtually free of high harmonic distortion. This improves efficiency and out put energy quality. Further, since the torque require ments may be more constant, voltage and frequency variations should be lessened, further contributing to a higher quality output energy. Unlike conventional generators, the field and the armature are both part of the stator assembly. No current is needed to excite the fields, and no energy is lost from arcing over slip rings or brushes. Distortion and weakening of the primary field by armature reaction is reduced because the coils are not in close proximity to the source of the magnetomotive force. This also results in more uniform torque requirements to drive the rotor, and in a higher quality output. Referring to Fig. 2A, an alternate embodi ment is discloeed that substitutes a single magnet 16 for the two magnets 6A, 6B of Fig. 1 with the magnet remote from the pole face. Magnetically permeable material 17 is connected to and in magnetic circuit with each of the pole faces thereof. The magnetically per meable material defines a gap 18 having typically planar surfaces that are angled with respect to each other. The rotor 19 is as described earlier with alternating segments of high and low magnetic permeability. The high permeability segments 20 may be shaped to correspond to the orientation and surface area of the planar surfaces of the gap 18. The magnet 16 may be located anywhere along the magnetic path including a position next to the air gap 18. The surface of the magnetic material 17 on either side of the air gap need not be planar. Neither do the high permeability segments 20 need to be planar. Further, the surfaces of segments 20 do not have to parallel the air gap surfaces of 17. In addition, any number of magnets may be used in any given flux path F. The remote location of the magnet enhances reliability and minimizes damage to the magnet. Referring to Figs. 3 6, the direction of the magnetomotive force through the stator core as generated by the magnets 6A, 6B is constant, as shown in Fig. 3. As the rotor turns and the alternating segments of high and low magnetic permeability vary the reluctance of the flux path F in each stator core, the magnitude of the flux with respect to time varies, as shown typically in Fig 4. a typical time derivative of the flux with respect to time in each stator core is shown in Fig. 5. Stated otherwise, the magnetic flux is not reversed, so that it varies only between a small positive value and a larger positive value, as reflected by points 22 and 23 on the graph of Fig. 6. This significantly reduces hysteresis and core losses and improves the efficiency of operation. The shape of the waveform representing the change in flux with respect to time way be varied by changing the size and shape of the alternating segments of high and low permeability. Referring now to Figs. 7 and 8, the generator includes a stator portion 31 and a rotor portion 32. The stator portion comprises a series of axially displaced, coaxial, wagon wheel type configurations with stator windings 34 typically surrounding each of the radial spokes betwween a central stator portion 35 and the peripheral stator portion 36. Alternatively, the windings can be on the peripheral stator portions 36 which may be, but are not necessarily, common to all ot the stator arms 33 connecting the peripheral and central stator portions. Pluralities of pairs of axially spaced permanent magnets 37 are in magnetic circuit with the central stator por tions 35 and peripheral stator portions 36. Like polarity poles of each pair are adjacent one another and define a cylinder 37S of like polarity poles, with the opposite polarity poles of the other magnet of each pair forming a second, axially spaced concentric cylinder 37N of like polarity poles. These two concentric cylinders 37S, 37N have a common axis 38 and form spaced opposite polarity poles that define an annular and specifically a cylindrical gap 40 therebetween. The magnetic axis of each magnet is aligned along radii perpendicular to the axis of the rotor. Referring to Fig. 8 and as noted earlier, the stator includes a cylindrical peripheral portion 36 having radially inwardly extending stator arms 33 in magnetic circuit therewith that terminate near the rotor portion 32. Adjacent the rotor, the cylinder 37N of permanent magnets in magnetic circuit with the stator portion is disposed with like polarity poles circum ferentially adjacent one another. The rotor illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 is typi cally, but not necessarily, cylindrical, being mounted on a shaft 41 journaled in bearings 42 that are fixed in casing 43. The rotor has longitudinally oriented peripherally spaced strips 44 of highly permeable magne tic material. The strips are embedded in a rotor of low permeability magnetic material 45, forming alternating bars of high and low magnetic permeability on the rotor surface. The stator and rotor together define a magne tic flux path G as shown in Fig. 7. As the rotor is turned around its axis 38, the segments of high and low magnetic permeability alternate through the length of the cylindrical gap 40. The magnetic flux in the gap cyclically alter nates between high values and low values as noted earlier, inducing a change in the magnetic flux in each of the stator arms 33. Thus, a voltage will be generated in the coils. Voltage control is accomplished as described for Figures 1 and 2 by coils surrounding the flux path G and or by switches not shown for selectively interconnecting coils 34. Referring to Figs. 9 and 10, the variable reluctance generator illustrated therein includes the cylindrical gap as shown in Figs. 7 and 8 together with a rotor having multiple axially displaced tiers, with adjacent tiers sharing magnetic paths. Referring to Fig. 9, the stator configuration is similar to that illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 with the stator windings 51 being wrapped around the peripheral portion 52 rather than the stator arms 53. Each of the axially displaced magnetic poles 54 57 is formed of segments of permanent magnets of like polarity poles, as illustrated at 54. The polarity of pole 55 is opposite that of pole 54, and the polarity of each axially succeeding pole alternates, as illustrated at succeeding poles 54 S , 55 N , 56 S , and 57 N , and as shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9. Each pole has a substantially continuous cylindrical face. The succeeding gaps 58 61 are defined by adjacent, opposite polarity poles. The opposite polarity poles are con nected by the magnetically permeable path of the stator arms 53 and peripheral portion 52. Similar to the variation of Figs. 1 and 2, one, two, or more magnets may be used in any magnetic flux path and they may be of any size, shape, material, or properties. Further, although disks and cylinders have been shown for the rotor configuration, any size or shape of rotor may be used. The size, shape, number and material of the flux path components may also vary. Referring to Figs. 9 and 10, the rotor R is comprised of five successive, axially displaced tiers 60 64 on a common rotor shaft 65 that is journaled in bearings 66 for rotation on the axis 67 of the stator. Each rotor tier is made of highly permeable magnetic material and has a bow tie, dog bone or propeller like cross sectional shape where portions of the material have been removed. Thus, since air has a low magnetic permeability, the rotation of the rotor R pre saints alternating surface segments having high and low magnetic permeability to complete the magnetic flux paths defined by the adjacent, but axially displaced, poles 54 57. Each rotor tier is rotationally displaced by the appropriate number of degrees from an adjacent tier to provide the desired poly phase relationships between each of the flux paths of the generator. The highly permeable rotor surface segments are shown cross hatched in the graph of Fig. 10. The material, dimen sions and relative rotational positions of the rotor segments, as well as the number of segments, may be varied as necessary or desirable to provide the desired generator phase, voltage, current or waveform output. In Figures 9 and 10 each pair of poles shares at least one pole with an adjacent pair of poles, and each of the tiers of the rotor shares a portion of its magnetic path with an adjacent tier so the material requirements in such a design may be reduced. However, the degree of sharing of magnetic paths between tiers and pole pairs may vary. Each tier and or pole may in fact be completely independent. Voltage control may be accomplished by the same means disclosed for Figs. 1, 2, 7, and 8. While par ticular embodiments have been disclosed, it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings. It is, therefore, contemplated that the appended claims cover any such modifications that incorporate those features which constitute the essential features of the present invention.
