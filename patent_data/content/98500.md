# Removal of chlorate from electrolyte cell brine.

## Abstract
A process for removing chlorate ions from a recirculating anolyte brine as typically used in membrane chlor alkali cells is disclosed. In this, a portion of the circulating brine after de chlorination and resaturation with additional alkali metal chlo ride is diverted and treated with a stoichiometric amount of hy drochloric acid to convert substantially all of the chlorate to chlorine gas and chloride ion. When performed in this manner, substantially lower quantities of acid are required as compared to prior art processes and the problems with the generation of ClOâ‚‚ are minimized.
