# Method and apparatus for building a tire.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a tire building apparatus 10 and preferred method for building a tire. The apparatus includes a longitudinally movable carriage 12 , a guideway 20 for the longitudinal movement of the car riage, a headstock 14 mounted on the carriage, a tire assembly drum 11 having an inboard end 29 and an outboard end and a drum support 15 mounted on the carriage. A plurality of operation stations A G are spaced longitudinally along the guideway, and mechanical datum fixedly located at each operation station, are provided to engage mechanical locators secured to the carriage. A bladder is provided selectively to cause engagement of the locators with the mechanical datum at each successive station to locate the tire assembly drum precisely with respect to the operation station. The apparatus further includes means to swing the drum support pivotally be tween an active and passive position, respectively to engage and disengage a bearing assembly with the hub of the drum, a tailstock 142 movable along a guideway 145 and onto the longitudinally movable carriage, grab segments 186 mounted on the tailstock selectively to deposit and remove annular assemblies from the drum, and a stitcher mounted on the carriage.
