# Recovery of acrylic acid.

## Abstract
A process for the separation of acrylic acid from an aqueous mixture of acrylic acid and water, in which a Group III A metal halide salt, preferably aluminium chloride is added to the aqueous mixture in an amount sufficient to form an organic phase containing acrylic acid and an aqueous phase, and the organic phase is separated from the aqueous phase. The aqueous mixture of acrylic acid and water is generally that obtained from the oxidation of propylene or acrolein over an oxidation catalyst, and preferably contains less than 1 by weight of acrolein. The separation is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 25 C to 75 C, more preferably 25 C to 50 C. A recovery of 95 of acrylic acid with a purity of 99 can be obtained with a single stage of preparation using an aluminium chloride salt.
