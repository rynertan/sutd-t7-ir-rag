# Internal combustion engine with bearing beam structure.

## Abstract
An automotive internal combustion engine 10 compris es a cylinder block 12 having a plurality of cylinder bores B and a plurality of bearing bulkheads 18 , and a bearing beam structure 20 secured to the bottom part of the cylinder block and including a plurality of main bearing cap sections 22 each of which associates with each cylinder block bearing bulkhead 18 to rotatably support the journal of a crankshaft, and two beam sections 24A,24B for securely connecting all the bearing cap sections 22 , the two beam sections 24A,24B extending parallel with the axis A of the crank shaft and being located at the opposite side portions, respectively, of each bearing cap section, thereby improving the strength of the main bearing cap sections 22 and the cylinder block bearing bulkheads 18 against the tortional and flexural vibrations to effectively suppress the vibrations of a cylinder block skirt section 16 and an oil pan 25 .
