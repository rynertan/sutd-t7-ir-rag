## Abstract
An improved self locking adjust tongue plate including a sleeve 112 surrounding a lock bar 110 extending in slots 108 provided on side flanges of the tongue. The sleeve spaces the lock bar from the walls of the slots so as to avoid metal to metal contact, which may adversely affect the lock up angles of the adjust tongue.
