# Video display control system.

## Abstract
A video display processor VDP for use with a central processing unit, a video RAM VRAM and a video display unit is capable of writing video image data supplied from an external video device such as a television set into the VRAM. The VDP comprises a first input terminal for receiv ing the external video image data and a second input termi nal for receiving horizontal and vertical synchronization signals from the external video device. The VDP generates address data in accordance with the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals and supplies the address data to the VRAM when processing of the external video image data is designated. The VDP also supplies the received external video image data to the VRAM thereby to write the external video image data into addresses of the VRAM designated by the address data. The external video image data may be either color codes representative of colors of display ele ments of a video image displayed at the external video device or data representative of amplitude levels of an analog video signal outputted from the external video de vice.
