## Description
CONTAINER FOR PRESSURISED LIQUID This invention relates to a container for pressure ised liquid, particularly but not exclusively a carbonated beverage. So called bag in box containers are already well known for still table wine. Such a container consists of a substantially impermeable bag, usually of metalised polyester, disposed within a box of cardboard or similar material, the bag being filled with wine and having a tap projecting through the box material so that the wine can be easily dispensed. The great advantage of such a container over a conventional bottle, carafe or the like is that the bag is made of flexible material so that as liquid is dispensed the bag collapses by a correspondin amount and no air is allowed to enter to cause oxidation of the liquid.Progressive oxidation of a beverage such as wine leads, of course, to the beverage firstly becoming stale and subsequently spoiled. Accordingly the bag in box packaging keeps the product fresh for an extended period. A further advantage of bag in box containers is that they are lighter than inmost conventional containers and are therefore more suitable for transporting liquids and or for holding larger quantities of liquid.The integral tap is also particularly convenient for dispensing the contained liquid and there is no difficulty in the consumer opening the container. It is desirable to extend bag in box packaging to pressurised liquids, particularly carbonated beverages such as beer and soft drinks, so as to achieve, in relation to these liquids, the above nentioned advantages. However, when such liquids are filled into flexible bags within semi rigid casings in the form of boxes, the latter have been found to sag or bulge outwardly because of the pressure within the liquid. This is clearly unsatisfactorily as it lakes the overall container unstable anTh lilcellr to topple over and it is not possible to stack tlie containers for storage or transportation. An object of the present invention is to provide a container based on the bage in box principle of a flexible bag within a serni rigid outer casing which will not sag or bulge or leak outwardly when filled with a pressurised liquid. With this object in view, the present invention provides a container for pressurised liquid comprising a box like casing enclosing a flexible bag which is adapted for reception of liquid and has a tap whereby the liquid may be dispensed from the container characterised in that the flexible bag is also located within a sleeve or tube. Where the sleeve or tube is make of substantially rigid or inelastic material, there is arranged at each end of the sleeve or tube a respective transverse platform having flanges directed towards the respective end of the casing so as to transmit pressure from the sleeve or tube to the respective end of the casing. Preferably, the base of the tap or an outlet member connecting the tap to the bag engages in a slot provided in one of the platforms so as to correctly position the bag within the casing. This also ensures that the tap itself is held securely in an appropriate dispensing position within the casing. Where the sleeve or tube is made of elastic material platforms are not required if the ends of the sleeve or tube are sealed. one end, of course, must be sealed around the base of the tap which projects for dispensation of liquid . Nevertheless one platform will proDaoly be provided for location of the tap as mentioned above, Advantageously, the case is provided with a removable portion defined by perforations in the vicinity of the tap so that prior to purchase of the filled container the tap is tamper proof, yet after purchase access to the tap is easily achieved by tearing away this portion. The bag itself is preferably formed of two layers of material, namely an inner layer of polyethylene and an outer covering of nylon aluminium polysolefin laminate. The latter material has been found to be particularly effective in preventing escape of carbon dioxide from carbonated liquids within the bag, and preventing the ingress of oxygen into the bag. Where one or more platforms are present they may be provided with additional flanges or cross walls to strengthen same and assist transmission of pressure from the sleeve or tube to the casing. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. I is an exploded perspective view of a preferred practical embodiment of the container of invention and Fig. 2 is a vertical cross section, to an enlarged scale, of the container of Fig. 1 when fully assembled. As illustrated, a preferred embodiment of the container of the invention comprises an outer casing in the form of a box, e.g. a printed corrugated box, 10 about 30 cm high and 18 cm by 18 cm in the outer directions. The box 10 has overlapping end flaps 11 and a portion 12 defined by perforations 13 extending over the edge between one of the side walls 14 of the box 1u and one of the flaps 11. Two spaced apart apertures not shown are also provided in the wall opposing the wall 14 for retention of a handle 28 in the form of a plastics strip having expanded end portions 29 located inside the box 10. Arranged within the uox 10 is a spirally wound cardboard tube 15 of substantially equal diameter to the internal dimensions of the box 10. The tube 15 is supported within the box 10 between respective transverse platforms o, 17. The platform 16 fits snugly into the base of the box 1u and is in the form of an inverted plastics tray having perpendicular flanges or a rim 18 directed rowards the end of the box 10. The other platform 17 is also generally in the form of a plastics tray of similar length and width to the box 10. This platform 17 fits on top of the tube 15 and has perpendicular edge flanges, or a rim, 19 directed towards the top end of the box 10 which is formed by the overlapping flaps 11 when they are secured in position.The platform 17 has a number of additional flanges or cross walls 20, also directed rowards tID top of the box 10, which serve to strengthen same and assist transmission of pressure from the tube 15 to the top of the box 10. A slot 21 is provided substantially midway along one edge of the platform 17 and extending partially across one flange 19. This slot is disposed adjacent to the perforated portion 12 of the box 10. Finally, and most importantly, a bag 22 is located within the tube 15. This bag 22 is formed of two inner sheets of linear low density polyethylene and two outer sheets of nylon aluminium linear low density polyethylene laminate bonded together at 23 adjacent their periphery. The bag 22 has a short cylindrlcal outlet member 24 with annular ridges 25 and a tap 26, the base of which also carries annular ridges 27, fits into said outlet member 24. By virtue of the annular ridged 25, the outlet member 24 engages into the slot 21 in the upper platform 17. This ensures that the tap 2b is held in the correct position beneath the perforated portion 12 of the box 10 and that the bag 22 is satisfactorily disposed within the tube 15. It is clear from the drawing that when the container is assembled, the platform 16 and then the tube 1, are placed into the box 10. The bag 22 is then fitted with an appropriate carbonated beverage, e.g. beer, and the tap 26, which is firmly closed, is inserted into the outlet member 24. The outlet member 24 is then slotted into the platform 17 and these are together placed into the box 10 such that the bag 22 lies within the tube 15 and the platform 17 rests on top of same. The flaps 11 are then closed. As mentioned, the portion 12 defined by perforations 13 lies over the tap 26 and ensures that the contents of the box 10 cannot be tampered with prior to sale to the eventual consumer. When the consumer wishes to dispense the carbonated beverage, he she simply tears away the portion 12 to reveal the tap 25 which is readily operated.It is envisaged that the tap 26 will be directed downwardly for dispensing the beverage. The great advantage of the aforesaid container is that by virtue of the tube 1v and the platforms 16, 1l, the sides of the box 10 do not sage or bulge outward due to the pressure in the liquid within the bag 22. The tube lj serves to direct this outward pressure in the longitudinal direction and the platforms 16, 1l, transmit same to the ends of the box 10. The abovedescribed container, which will hold up to 4.5 litres of liquid, has been found to withstand high pressures of 10 to 20 lb sq. in 68.9b to 137,90 kpa . It should be understood that the foregoing is merely illustrative and not limitative of the scope of the invention and many variations are possible.particular, it must be understood that the tube 15 need not be rigid or self supporting and could be provided by a collapsible component which is stored flat prior to assembly. Moreover, the tube 15 may be replaced by a sleeve of elastic material which assists in the collapse of the bag so as to minimuse headspace inside the bag, the only requirement being that the material should encircle the bag and transmit the pressure of the liquid lengthwise of the container.The rigid transverse platforms lo, 17 may be omitted if the elastic sleeve is sealed at both ends. However, it will probably be desirable to retain one platform having a slot for engagement with the bag outlet member so thatthe tap and the bag are held in the correct position. Of course, the materials and dimensions of all the components may differ from those in the particularly described embodiment. For example, the platforms may have any number of additional flanges or cross walls to improve their strength. Also the bag material mayVary. Although it has been found that the nylon aluminium polyethylene laminate is particularly effective in preventing loss of carbon dioxide from the contained liquid, other materials may be used or may be found more suitable for retention of other pressurised liquids. Furthermore, the base of the tap, instead of the bag outlet member, may engage the upper platform, although it is not absolutely essential for either to do so.
