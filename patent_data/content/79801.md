# Tool wear and tool failure monitor system.

## Abstract
In a computerized numerical control CNC or a direct numerical control DNC machine tool, the second derivative as a function of time of the net power applied to the cutting tool is used to detect approaching tool failure, and a statistical representation of such occurrences with a series of tools is used to derive instantaneously the percentage of wear experienced by a new tool in terms of the statistically expected critical level of net power.
