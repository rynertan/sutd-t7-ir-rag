# Transducer for measuring torque and or speed of rotating shaft.

## Abstract
A magnetic transducer 10 fits over and encompasses a rotatable shaft 11 and has a primary or excitation magnetic assembly 14 having a winding arrangement that is ener gized to provide a c excitation for producing an alternating magnetic flux or field, adjacent to and within the shaft, which is modified as the shaft is torsionally stressed when torque is applied thereto. This stressing causes compression and tension in the shaft which alter the shaft permeability and thus vary the magnetic flux pattern in the shaft. A pair of secondary or pick up magnetic assemblies 15, 16 , having secondary windings respond to the modified magnetic field and provide information signals relative to the torque and speed characteristics of the rotating shaft. The size, weight, cost and complexity of the transducer are substantially reduced by constructing the three magnetic assemblies so that the primary and secondary windings are effectively wrapped around the shaft 11 .
