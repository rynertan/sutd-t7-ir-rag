# CHARACTER INPUT APPARATUS

## Abstract
A character input apparatus has a position input device 11 for inputting coordinate values corresponding to a position indicated by contacting an input surface, a recognition pro cessor 42 for analyzing a coordinate value string sequentially input by the position input device 11 to obtain a character code corresponding thereto, and a display device 14 for displaying the character code obtained by the recognition processor 42 . The character input apparatus includes a character size processor 43 for discriminating a distribution range of the coordinate value string to obtain character size data corresponding to the size of the distribution range. A character is displayed on the display device 14 in a character size corresponding to the character size data obtained by the character size processor 43 .
