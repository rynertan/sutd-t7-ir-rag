## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to the manufacture of alkyl silicates mere particularly ethyl silicate.Ethyl silicate finds industrial application as ethyl orthosilicate, tetraethoxysilane as ethyl polysilicate, ethoxypolysiloxanes, also as a mixture of ethyl orthosilicate and ethyl polysilicates. The most readily commercially available product is technical ethyl silicate which is a miuture of ethyl orthosilicate and ethyl polysilicates and contains silicon equivalent to a silica content of approximately 40 .Amongst the important industrial application of ethyl silicate is the binding of refractory powders. Ethyl silicate when hydrolysed forms a hydrolysate which is gellable, usually with the aid of a catalyst, to provids a rigid and coherent gel. Slurries of refractory powder and the gellable hydrolysate can thus be formed to the desired shape either by cavity or pat tern moulding and thereafter set in this shape by gelling cf the hydrolysate. The most widely used method for the prepared tion of ethyl silicate is tile reaction of silicon tetrachioride with ethyl alcohol. This process has the disadvantage that hydrogen chloride is obtained as a by product which has to be removed and thereafter disposed of. The removal of hydrogen chloride requires expensive equipment and detracts from the economy of the manufacturing method and the disposal of hydrogen chloride which constitutes a hazardous waste is at expensive and environmentally undesirable operation. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the manufacture of ethyl silicate which is based on the direct reaction of ethanol with silicon or silicides, i.e. compounds of metallic elements with silicon. sslthough the reactions of the present invention will be described with primary reference to ethanol it should be recognised that they are in principle applicable to other alcohols. The reaction between ethanol and silicon which produces ethyl silicate and hydrogen gas is, in principle, known but has not been effectively commercialised due to difficulties in obtaining economic yields According to the present invention the reaction between ethanol and silicon or a silicide is carried out at a high temperature in a catalytic solution which has sufficient thermal capacity effectively to maintain the temperature aad to catalyse the reaction and to discharge tetraethoxysilane as a vapour together with ethanol vapour and hydrogen gas. The thermal capacity of the catalytic solution can be maintained and indeed increased by stepwise additions of ethanol and silicon or a silicide, then tetraethoxysilane and ethanol are removed as vapour and the sequence repeated. The reaction can be su arised as follows EMI3.1 The invention is based on the recognition that although the reaction between silicon and ethanol is an exothermic reaction the discharge of the vapour products, i.e. the mixture of ethanol and tetraethoxysilane vapours draws from the reaction their latent heat of vapourisation. Also the addition of the reagents can lower the temperature of the system. In order to maintain the high tempera ture necessary for economic realisation of the reaction there has to be sufficient thermal capacity in the catalytic solution to maintain this in spite of the heat withdrawn by the vapourisatlon of the products.It is necessary for the reagents to have sufficient dell time in the solution for the reaction to take place. The necessary thermal capacity can be achieved a by carrying out the reaction at as high a temperature as is practicable. This should at least be at the boiling point of the tetraethoxysilane ethanol mixture. Thus a reaction of temperature of at least 100 C and possibly as high as 1800C is envisaged. 135 170 C is the broad preferred range and 150 165 C the narrower preferred range. b by maintaining a relatively large volume of catalytic solution. Thus there should be at least 500 ml.of catalytic solution for each mole of silicon. The upper limit of the catalytic solution silicon ratio is not so important but 3000 ml mole is a reasonable figure. c by the selection of an appropriate catalytic solution as will bs described. The reaction may be carried out using batches of reagents or may be started batches of reagents and then maintained by continuous additions of ethanol and silicon or silicide to a relatively large volume of the catalytic solution. A preferred expedient is to introduce the reagents below the surface of the solution preferably near the bottom of the reaction vessel. When the reagents are not preheated, on entry they initially lower the temperature of the solution and then commence their catalysed reaction.As the reagents rise through the catalytic solution the reaction proceeds until the mixture of ethanol and products is vaporized with a considerable loss of heat. The large thermal capacity of the volume of the catalytic solution at elevated temperature readily provides that heat. The rate of reaction can be monitored by measuring the rate of evolution of hydrogen. The action of the catalyst in this particular reaction is to form a complex with the reagents, the complex thereafter disassociating, regenerating the catalyst and the reaction products. In principle therefore industrial catalysts which operate in this manner can be used and of such the metal alkoxides are preferred. The solvent for the catalyst must not undergo an irreversible reaction with the catalyst under the relatively extreme reaction conditions and must be able to survive these conditions. The solvent must therefore have a high boiling point and be chemically inert and neutral. Preferred solvents are linear digomers of the following general formula I EMI6.1 where n is 1 or a whole number greater than 1 or cyclic compounds of the general formula II EMI6.2 where n is 3 or a whole number grea ter than 3A is CR3, OR where R is C1 C4 alkyl preferably ethyl, O CH2CH2O m 9, where D is methyl, ethyl or phenyl and m is 1 or 2. Preferably m is 1 and D is ethyl. Preferably all the A groups are the same in each com pound. 3 is the same as A and when A is CR3, B can also be C6H5. When A is OR or O CH2CH2O mD, the solvent may also contain SiA4 and or A3Si O SiA3 species, provided that there is not more than 20 by weight of SiA4 and 4C96 by weight of A3Si O SiA3.When A is CH3, the solvent may also contain not more than 20 by weight of Si OR 4 and or Si O CH2CH2O mD 4 species. When A is CH3 and B is C6R5 the solvent may also contain not more than 60 of Si OR 4 species,R being preferably ethyl. The solvent may also comprise a mixture of com ponents having different A groups and it may also be a mixture of cyclic and linear polymers. Examples of suitable solvents are the methyl polysiloxanes and the methyl phenyl polysiloxanes, which may be linear or cyclic, also the ethoxypoly siloxanes. Tetraethoxysilane and technical ethyl silicate are other suitable solvents one example of the latter is described in British Patent No.647,137.It is important that the reagents should be as dry and pure as possible. Specifically the alcohol should be dried using a molecular sieve. The preferred metal alkoxides are the alkali metal alkoxides particularly those of sodium and potassium. A mixture of sodium alkoxide and potas sium alkoxide is advantageous. The alkali metal alkoxide is preferably derived from ethanol or the alcohol EO CH2CH20 aD. Another possible catalyst is the reaction product of sodium ethoxide and 2 ethoxyethanol. According to a more restricted aspect the present invention provides a method of preparing tetraethoxysilane which comprises preparing the catalytic solution for example by the following steps. 1 Dissolving a metal or metals in an alcohol under an inert atmosphere, for example nitrogens When more than one metal is used they will preferably be added sequentially. 2 Warming the solution produced in 1 preferably under reflux. The warming time should be at least 1.5 hours preferably at least 4 hours. 3 Adding to the metal alkoxide catalyst produced a relatively large volume of high boiling point inert and neutral solvent. 4 Adding to the catalytic solution silicon or a silicide in admixture with liquid dry ethanol. 5 Warming the solution preferably to at least 1100C to initiate the catalysed reaction and 6 Adding further dry liquid ethanol. Steps 4 to 6 can be modified by adding the silicon or metal silicide to the solution of 3 , subsequently warming and thereafter adding the ethanol. For on industrial application steps 1 to 3 can be carried out as a separate process. The ethanol can be introduced as a vapour into the lower part of the reaction vessel. The reaction which may be carried out continu oysly by addition of ethanol and silicon or metal silicida produces an azeotropic mixture of ethanol and tetraethoxysilane vapours which is distilled off. All steps are preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere as is mandatory for step 1 . The product of the process described above is tetraethoxysilane and the present invention also proposes converting the tetraethoxysilane to technical ethyl silicate by controlled hydrolysis and condensation polymerisation thereby increasing the silica equivalent. The preferred technical ethyl silicate contains silicon equivalent to approxinately 400 SiO2 by weight.

No distillate was collected in this cycle, i.e. the reaction was done under total reflux condition. It is necessary to maintain a minimum pot temperature of 14000. Although a minimum pot temperature of 14000 is required, the temperature is preferably in the range 155 1650C. The ethanol addition can be replaced by a mixture of ethanol and tetraethoxysilane. Separation of tetraethoxysilane from reaction Mixture. The separation of tetraethoxysilane from the reaction mixture was carried out by the following procedure. i The preferred pot temperature is 150 C. ii Dry ethanol was added to the reaction mixture at a rate such that a constant head temperature is maintained. iii It is preferable to remove the product as a mixture of tetraethoxysilane and methanol. The product should be removed at a high head temperature 1400C or over to ensure that the distillate is rich in tetraethoxysilane. It is important that only the amount of tetraethoxysilane produced is removed. The ethanol tetraethoxZsilene mixture collected is distilled to separate the ethanol and the tetraethoxysilane. The ethanol recovered can be re used. After the tetraethoxysilane produced has been removed, the sequence of stepwise additions of sili con and ethanol is repeated to continue the product tion of tetraethoxysilane. This in its turn is removed then the sequence of stepwise additions of silicon and ethanol is continued.C Preparation of ethanol nolysilicaçe from tetra ethoxysilane.

The mixture of tetraethoxysilane, anhydrous ethanol and acid solution is heated to reflux tem perature and water added dropwise with stirring over a period of 30 minutes. Refluxing is carried out for 60 minutes when the addition is completed. The ethanol is recovered from the product by distillation under gradual lowering of pressure. Distillation was finished when a pot temperature of 140 C at 100 mm Hg pressure was reached. The amount of ethanol recovered was 180 volumes. This can be used again in the preparation.

Reactions carried out in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Dry ethanol must be used, the procedures for drying are given in example 1. The rate of reaction may be followed by measuring the rate of hydrogen evolution.This is used to control the rate of addition of reac tants to maintain optimum reaction rate. Usually silicon is added in batches and ethanol added dropwise, or a silicon ethanol slurry added, when the observed rate of hydrogen evolution diminishes to a low value. The reaction temperature is maintained as constant as possible. EXAMPLE 23 Preparation of sodium potassium 2 ethoxyethoxide catalyst in the presence of toluene as diluent.

Potassium 19g 0.5mole was introduced in the flask which was flushed thoroughly with dry nitrogen, then 2 ethoxyethanol was added slowly dropwise. All potassium dissolved after addition of 160 ml 2 ethoxyethanol. Then sodium 11.5g 0.5 mole was introduced in the flask followed by the addition of 2 ethoxyethanol. The total volume of 2 ethoxyethanol added was 300 ml.The solution was gently warmed and the toluene then distilled off at 121 0C while the remaining solution was refluxed for 4 hours until evolution of hydrogen ceased.The rate of addition of 2 ethoxyethanol is controlled by the rate of hydrogen evolution. The initial reaction between 2 ethoxyethanol and potassium 15 vigorous but soon subsides. The reaction with sodium is less vigorous. The 2 ethoxyethanol can be added to sodium and potassium metals. All reactions are carried out under dry nitrogen. Unless otherwise stated, this procedure was used to prepare the sodirlm potassium 2 ethoxyethoxide required in the following example. EXAMPLE 24 preparation of ethyl Silicate using sodium potassium 2 ethoxyethoxide catalyst.

The catalytic solution is made by charging to the reaction vessel 45 gallons of tetraethoxysilane, followed by 45 gallons of sodium potassium 2 ethoxyethoxide 1 1 molar ratio of sodium to potassium prepared by the procedure previously described, then by a further 30 gallons of tetraethoxysilane. To this catalytic solution, 5 kg silicon powder and 10 litres of ethanol were added. The mixture was heated until the reactor temperature rose to 140 C. At this stage the distillation head temperature was at ambient temperature. PRODUCTION OF TETRAETHOXYSILANE Dry and pre heated ethanol was added at a rate such that the reactor temperature does not drop below 1400C. Ethanol was added at the required rate until evolution of hydrogen ceases. Then a further 5 g oP silicon was added together wIth more ethanol at the required rate until the evolution of hydrogen ceased. No distillate was collected in this cycle, i.e. reaction is run under total reflux condition. Stepwise addition of silicon and ethanol was continued until 50 kg of silicon had been added.NOTES a It is necessary to maintain a minimum reactor temperature of 140 C. b Although a mininum reactor temperature of 140 0C is required, the temperature is preferably in the range of 155 1650C. c The ethanol addition can be replaced by the addition of a mixture of ethanol and tetraethoxysilane. d Only 5 kg of silicon powder should be added at a time.SEPARATION OF TETRAETHOXYSILANE FROM THE REACTIONMIXTURE The separation of tetraethoxysilane from the reaction mixture has been successfully carried out by the following procedure i Minimum reactor temperature desirable is 150 C. ii Dry ethanol is added to the reaction mixture at a rate such that a constant head temperature is maintained. iii It is preferable to remove the product as a mixture of ethanol and tetraethoxysilane at a high head temperature 1400C or over to ensure that the distillate is rich in tetraethoxysilane. iv It is important that only the amount of tetraethoxysilane produced during the run is removed. The ethanol tetraethoxysilane mixture collected is fractionally distilled to separate the ethanol and the tetraethoxysilane. The ethanol recovered can be re used. After the tetraethoxysilane produced has been removed from the reactor, the sequence of stepwise additions of silicon and ethanol is repeated to continue the production of tetraethoxysilane. This in turn is removed and the sequence of stepwise additions of silicon and ethanol is continued.
