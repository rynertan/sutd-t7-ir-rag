## Description
DESCRIPTIONTITLE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN ALPHA OLEFIN POLYMER This invention relates to an improved process for producing an alpha olefin polymer to be sometimes used to include a copolymer of an alpha olefin also , which comprises polymerizing to be used to denote copolymerization also an alpha olefin or alpha olefins in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid titanium catalyst component and an organoaluminu catalyst component. Nore specifically, this invention relates to a gas phase polymerization process which can afford an alpha olefin polymer by an easy operation in a simple apparatus with a good reproduciblity of quality, and which can be performed smoothly, efficiently and stably while avoiding various operational troubles. In particular, the present invention provides a process for producing an alpha olefin polymer or Co polymer which comprises polymerizing or copolymerizing an alpha olefin or alpha olefins under gas phase polymerization or copolymerization conditions in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid titanium catalyst component and an organoaluminum compound characterized in that said process is carried out under a set of the following parameters A to E A said gas phase polymerization or copolymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound and said organoaluminum compound, said catalyst having been pretreated by polymerizing or copolymerizing not more than about 200 g per gram of said solid titanium catalyst component, of an olefin or olefins in its presence, B said gas phase polymerization or copolymerization is carried out while maintaining the polymerization or copolymerization system in the fluidized state by mechanically stirring it and blowing said olefin in the gaseous state and or a gaseous, easily volatile non polymerizable. hydrocarbon into it, C said olefin in the liquid state and or a liquid, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon is introduced into the polymerization or copolymerization system and while gasifying said olefin and or said hydrocarbon in said system, said gas phase polymerization or copolymerization is carried out, D the unreacted olefin gas and or the easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon gas discharged from the polymerization or copolymerization system is partly or wholly liquefied and recycled as the liquid olefin and or hydrocarbon in C , and E said olefin is blown or introduced into the polymerization or copolymerization system in at least one of B and C . Previously, a slurry polymerization method or a solution polymerization method using an olefin itself or an inert solvent as a reaction medium has been predominantly employed in the polymerization of olefinsThese polymerization methods, however, require many posttreatment operations such as the separation of the resulting polymer from the reaction medium, the drying of the polymer, the recovery of the reaction medium, and the purification of the polymer. In contrast, in a gas phase polymerization method, these post treatment operations could be omitted or simplified. However, it suffers from various troubles in polymerization operation, and it has been difficult to perform the gas phase polymerization smoothly, efficiently and stably to give an olefin polymer with a good reproducibility of quality. In gas phase polymerization of olefins using an old type Ziegler titanium catalyst component such as TiCl3.l 3Al013 or TiOl4, or an old type titanium catalyst component supported on a carrier such as olefin polymer particles, silica particles, alumina particles, titanium oxide particles or calcium carbonate particles, the activity of the catalyst is insufficient, and the catalyst residue in the resulting polymer cannot be reduced to such an extent that makes it possible to omit the de ashing operation. Hence, this gas phase polymerization procedure has the trouble of requiring the deashing treatment, but it has been impossible to provide means capable of removing this trouble satisfactorily.Furthermore, the gas phase polymerization operation is difficult to perform smoothly, efficiently and stably, and the quality reproducibility of the polymer is poor.Thus, despite a number of proposals made about the production of polyolefins by gas phase polymerization, the slurry polymerization method and the solution polymerization method are still in widespread use today. One prior suggestion is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 84184 73 laid open onNovember 9, 1973 corresponding to UoS. Patent No. 3,877,861 . The gas phase polymerization suggested in this Publication is characterized by the fact that propylene is first polymerized in a separate vessel in the presence of a transition metal catalyst component and an organometallic compound in an inert diluent, the amount of propylene being not more than 100 times, preferably not more than 50 times, the weight of the transition metal catalyst component, and then the resulting suspension containing the prepolymerization treated catalyst composed of the transition metal catalyst component and the organometallic compound is fed into a gasphase polymerization zone and the polymerization is continued.This Publication, however, fails to disclose the use of a solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound, and only TiCl3.l 3A1C13 is used in a working example. Purthermore, this prior Publication fails to give any description about the use of mechanical stirring, the introduction of both a gaseous alpha olefin and or a gaseous, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon and a liquid alpha olefin and or a liquid, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon, and the re use of the unreacted alpha olefin gas and or easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon gas discharged from the polymerization system as the liquid alpha olefin and or liquid, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon. Japanese Patent Publication No. 17487 67 published on September 13, 1967 corresponding toBritish Patent No. 1,010,627 discloses a gas phase polymerization process wherein the same suspension as described in the aforesaid prior Publication which contains a prepolymerization treated catalyst is fed into a gas phase polymerization zone and polymerized. ThisPatent Publication discloses that by feeding the suspension together with an inert liquid medium such as propane, butane, pentanes and hexanes, the gas phase polymerization zone or bed is maintained in the fluidized stable by utilizing the abrupt gasification and expansion of the liquid medium. This Patent Publication neither discloses the use of a solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound, and the transition metal catalyst component is limited to a trihalide of Ti and or V. Moreover, this PatentPublication does not describe the re use of the unreacted alpha olefin gas and or the gasified inert liquid medium as the liquid alpha olefin and or inert liquid medium. Japanese Patent Publications Nos. 11489 72 published on April 11, 1972 corresponding to U.S.Patent No. 3,639,377 and Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 7640 75 published on March 27, 1975 disclose that a liquid alpha olefin and a liquid inert medium are fed into the gas phase polymerization system, and the inert liquid medium discharged is recycled for re use. In this suggestion, too, only the use of TiCl3.l 3A1C13 component is disclosed, and no description is made as to the use of a solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound. Japanese Patent Publications nows. 14862 74 published on April 10, 1974 and 30539 77 published on August 9, 1977 also disclose other proposals for gas phase polymerization of alpha olefins. All of these prior suggestions require a deashing treatment, and cannot provide satisfactory means for removing the various troubles associated with the performance of gas ph se polymerization such as the difficulty of performing gas phase polymerization smoothly, efficiently and stably and the poor reproducibility of quality. Accordingly, the slurry polymerization and solution polymerization method still occupy a pre dominant position in this technical field. On the other hand, the solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound is known. The behavior of this catalyst component in gas phase polymerization in the present invention has been unknown and not been elucidated. Accordingly, technical problems in the utilization of this catalyst component in such gas phase polymerization have not been known, and of course, no means for solving such problems has been suggested. The present inventors made investigations about the method of gas phase polymerization of olefin using a highly active titanium catalyst component in order to provide an improved process which can make best of the advantages of the gas phase olefin polymerization process and overcome its disadvantages. As a result, they know that more technical problems must be solved in order to obtain a polymer of high quality by polymerizing olefins in the gaseous phase using a highly active titanium catalyst component continuously over a long period of time. Investigations of the present inventors have shown that troubles, such as the difficulty of forming a uniform mixture of polymer particles in a gas phase polymerization bed, blocking of polymer particles, powderization of the polymer particles by friction between them incident to forced agitation, the adhesion of the polymer to the reactor wall, entrainment of the catalyst components or the resulting polymer, and the need for removal of heat, increase. It has been found that gas phase polymerization of olefins utilizing a highly active titanium catalyst component cannot be virtually performed smoothly, efficiently and stably unless these increased troubles are removed, and the process cannot be operated for 9 long period of time or a polymer of high quality cannot be obtained with a good reproducibility of its quality. The present inventors continued their investigations in order to solve the aforesaid technical problems and to provide an improved process which can afford an olefin polymer of high quality with a good reproducibility of its quality by performing gas phase polymerization of an olefin smoothly, efficiently and stably utilizing a highly active titanium catalyst component. As a result, they have found that such an improved process can be advantageously and easily achieved by using a solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component as the highly active catalyst component and performing gas phase polymerization of an alpha olefin under a set of parameters A to E described herein above. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide an improved process for polymerizating or Co polymerizing olefins in the gaseous phase. The above and other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. The catalyst used in this invention is a highly active catalyst composed of a solid titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium, and an organoaluminum compound. Under the polymerization conditions employed, this catalyst is capable of forming an olefin polymer in an amount of at least 100,000 parts by weight, preferably at least 150,000 parts by weight, more preferably at least 200,000 parts by weight, per part by weight of titanium in the titanium catalyst component.

The solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound can be produced by methods. known per se, for example by a method comprising directly contacting the above exemplified magnesium compound and titanium compound and a method comprising contacting the magnesium compound in a desired sequence with one or more of an electron donor, a halo gensting agent, an organometallic compound, a silicon compound, etc., and then contacting the resulting product with the titanium compound. The mode of contacting may, for example, be mere mixing, contacting involving mechanical pulverization, contacting in the absence of mechanical pulverization, contacting in the presence of an inert diluent, etc. These modes of contacting are widely known, and can be utilized in forming the solid titanium catalyst component for use in this invention. examples of the electron donor which can be used in preparing the highly active catalyst component include oxygen containing electron donors such as water, alcohols, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, acid amides and acid anhydrides and nitrogen containing electron donors such as amnonia, amines, nitriles and isocyanates.

In the gas phase polymerization in accordance with this invention, various additives including hydrogen, electron donors and organic halides may be used in order to control molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, stereospecificity, etc. For improvement of stereospecificity, organic acid esters, above all aromatic carboxylic acid esters, are suitable. The olefin used in the polymerization process of this invention is at least one alpha olefin having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as ethylene, propylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, 4 methyl l pentene, l octene, and l decene. The process of this invention is especially suitable for production of a highly crystalline polymer comprising a major proportion for example, at least 90 mole0 of units derived from ethylene or propylene. The solid halogen containing catalyst component used in the gas phase polymerization of this invention is prepolymerization treated with an olefin as specified in requirement A . The prepolymerization treatment is carried out by polymerizing a small amount of an olefin using the solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound and an organoaluminum catalyst component. Preferably, the prepolymerization is carried out in the liquid phase. An olefin itself or an inert solvent may be used as a reaction medium in the prepolymerization treatment. The prepolymerization treatment, if desired, may be carried out in the presence of hydrogen or an electron donor as in the main polymerization step. The olefin used in the prepolymerization treatment needs not to be the same as an olefin to be polymerized in the main polymerization step.Generally, however, these olefins are the same.Examples of the inert solvent that can be used in the prepolymerization treatment include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, n pentane, iso pentane, nhexane, iso hexane, n heptane, n octane, iso octane, ndodecane and kerosene alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene and halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, ethylene chloride and chlorobenzene.Of these, the aliphatic hydrocarbons, especially those having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, are preferred. In the prepolymerization treatment, the solid titanium catalyst component is used in an amount of generally about 0.001 to about 500 millimoles, preferably about 0.005 to about 200 millimoles, calculated as titanium atom, per liter of the liquid phase. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound is used in such a proportion that the Al Ti atomic ratio becomes from about 0.1 to about 1000, especially from about 0.5 to about 500. The temperature of the prepolymerization treatment is preferably about 300C to about 900This temperature can be varied depending upon the type of the olefin to be pre polymerized.For example, it is about 30 to about 90 C, especially from about 0 to about 70 C, for ethylene from about 30 to about 800 C, especially from about 0 to about 5COC, for propylene from about 30 to about 4000, especially from about 0 to about 300C for l butene and fro about 30 to about 800C, especially from about 0 to about 500r, for methylpentene. The amount of the olefin to be prepolymerized may be very small to obtain the required effect. For example, it may be not more than about 200 g, for example about 0.01 to about 200 g, especially from about 0.1 to about 100 g, per gram of the solid titanium catalyst component, and is preferably adjusted to not more than about 10 by weight, especially not more than about 5 by weight, of the total amount polymerized. In the process of this invention, an alphaolefin is polymerized in the gaseous phase in the presence of a catalyst meeting the aforesaid requirement A in the presence or absence of an easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon. The gas phase polymerization can be performed, for example, at a temperature Bumf, then the flow rate of the gas is maintained at about 0.1 Umf to about 10 Urf, preferably at about 0.5Umf to about 3 bumf. The titanium catalyst component subjected to the prepolymerization treatment can be fed into the reaction bed or into its top portion. In the gas phase polymerization, the titanium catalyst component is used in an amount of generally about 0.0005 to about 1 millimole, preferably about 0.001 to about 0.5 millimole, calculated as titanium atom, per liter of the volume of the reaction zone or bed, and the organoaluminum compound is used in an Al Ti atomic ratio of generally from about 1 to about 2000, preferably from about 10 to about 500. In addition to the catalyst components subjec ted to the prepolymerization treatment, a fresh supply of the organoaluminum compound and optionally additives such as an electron donor may be additionally supplied.The catalyst components may be fed as suspended in an inert solvent or olefin. Hydrogen that can be used to control molecular weight may be fed through any desired part of the polymerization vessel. In the process of this invention, as specified in the requirement C described hereinabove, a liquid olefin and or a liquid, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon is introduced into the reaction system and gasified. Upon gasification, these liquids absorb the heat of polymerization in the polymerization vessel. Furthermore, as specified in the aforesaid requirement D the unreacted olefin gas and or the easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon gas discharged from the reaction system is partly or wholly liquefied, for example in a condenser, and recycled for use as the liquid olefin and or hydrocarbon in C . The polymerization temperature is controlled mainly by the amount of the recycle. The olefin to be polymerized is fed as in B and or C . As shown in the requirement E , the olefin of about 300to about 1300C and a pressure of about 1 to about 100 kg cm2. The easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon as used herein denotes a hydrocarbon which can be easily gasified under the alpha olefin gas phase polymerization conditions and does not polymerize under these polymerization conditions. Preferably, these hydrocar bons are liquefiable at low temperatures and pressures. Typical examples of the hydrocarbons that can be used for this purpose are those having 3 to 6, preferably 3 to 5, carbon atoms such as propane, butane, pentane and cyclopentane. Such an easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon is used mainly for the purpose of removing the heat of polymerization. Furthermore, as specified in the aforesaid reirenent B , the process of this invention is carried out while maintaining the reaction system containingthe alpha olefin polymer particles formed in the aforesaid prepolymerization treatment and the catalyst subjected to the prepolymerization treatment in the fluidized state by mechanically stirring the reaction system and blowing a gaseous alpha olefin and or a gaseous, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon into the system. The mechanical stirring can be performed by using various types of stirrer such as an anchor type stirrer, a screw type stirring and a ribbon type stirrer.The gaseous olefin and or the gaseous, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon are blown into the reaction system from the bottom of the reaction zone or bed.For example, it is conveniently p erformed through an airpermeable partition for forming a fluidized bed, such as a porous plate, in order to disperse these gases uniformly throughout the reaction zone or bed. The flow rate of the gas is preferably maintained at a suitable value in order to facilitate fluidization of the reaction bed, reduce the load of the mechanical stirring and prevent entrainment. Let the minimum speed of fluidization be is blown or introduced into the polymerization system in at least one of B and C . One embodiment of the process of this invention is shown in Figure 1. An olefin is prepolymerized in a prepolymerization tank 1 in the presence of a solid halogen containing titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound and an organoaluminum compound.The product of the pre polymerization is continuously fed into a reaction bed or zone 3 of a gas phase polymerization tank through a pipe 11. An additional supply of the organoaluminum compound is fed to the reaction zone or bed 3 of the tank 2 through a pipe 12. The reaction zone or bed 3 of the gas phase polymerization tank 2 is stirred by a stirrer 4. h gaseous olefin remaining uncondensed at a condenser 6, or a fresh supply of olefin, is fed to the bottom of the polymerization tank through a pipe 13 or a pipe 14. The gaseous olefin reaches the reaction bed through a porous plate 5 to fluidize the reaction bed, and is also used in the polymerization.Hydrogen for molecular weight control is fed into the polymerization tank through a pipe 15. The unreacted olefin gas discharged from the polymerization tank is condensed at the condenser 6 via a pipe 16, conveyed to a drum 7, and passed through a pipe 17, and finally sprayed onto the reaction bed from a spray section 18.The resulting polymer is continuously or intermittently withdrawn from a pipe 19 so that the height of the reac tion bed is maintained constant. The mechanical stirring of the reaction bed is essential in uniformly dispersing the high temperature active catalyst and the liquid olefin or the liquid, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon in the reaction bed. By this operation alone, the rate of mix ing is slow, and the required stirring power is extremely high. Furthermore, friction occurs vigorously between particles or between particles and the wall surface to cause pulverization of the particles. These defects can be markedly remedied by using the mechanical stirring in combination with the fluidization of the reaction bed by blowing a gaseous olefin and or a gaseous, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon trequirement B 3. As a result of gas blowing, the speed of mixing of the highly active catalyst and the liquid olefin or easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon in particles can be increased to about 1.5 to about 2 times and the power required for the mechanical stirring can be decreased to about 1 2 to about 1 10, thus making it possible to perform the polymerization reaction very smoothly.On the other hand, fluidization of the reaction bed by blowing the gaseous olefin or the gaseous, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon results in powder entrainment to an unnegligible degree, and therefore, much care is required regarding the particle size, particle size distribution and shape of the powder. In accordance with this invention, the polymer forming the reaction bed has a narrow particle size distribution and an increased particle diameter by using a titanium catalyst component supported on a magnesium compound which has been subjected to pre polymerization treatment with an olefin. Consequently, entrainment of the titanium catalyst component or polymer is drastically reduced. Since the catalyst used in this invention is highly active, its adhesion to the reactor wall or pipings is vigorous. Rence, care must be exercised in the entrainment of the titanium catalyst component or the polymer. By subjecting the titanium catalyst component to the prepolymerization treatment, the entrainment is drastically reduced, and adhesion of the catalyst to the reactor wall, pipings, etc. and the consequent clogging are obviated. Furthermore, it has been unexpectedly found that the resulting polymer has an increased bulk density and its state of fluidization is further improved, and that localized polymerization is easy to avoid and after the polymerization, the polymer lends itself to easy handling. Moreover, uniform polymerization can be performed because the polymerization temperature can be controlled by introducing the liquid olefin or the liquid, easily volatile non polymerizable hydrocarbon into the reaction system and gasifying it in the reaction bed having a good state of mixing. Nitrogen gas stream may be passed through the polymer powder discharged from the polymerization tank in order to remove the olefin, etc. contained in the powder.If desired, it may be pelletized by an extruder. A small amount of water, an alcohol, etc. may be added at this time in order to deactivate the catalyst completely.A stabilizer, an antioxidant, etc. may also be incorporated. The following Examples illustrate the process of this invention more specifically.Example 1 Preparation of a titanium catalyst conponent Commercially available anhydrous magnesium chloride 30 g , 7.5 ml of ethyl benzoate and 4.5 ml of methylpolysiloxane viscosity 20 c.s at 2500 were contacted for 40 hours in a vibratory ball mill in an atmosphere of nitrogen. Twenty grams of the resulting solid product was suspended in 200 ml of Till4, and con tacted with it at 80 C for 2 hours with stirring. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was decanted, and the supernatant liquid was washed with purified hexane. This operation was repeated until no chlorine was de tected in the hexane used in washing the supernatant liquid. The resulting titanium catalyst component con tained 1.9 k by weight of titanium and 65 by weight of chlorine calculated as atoms. The above operation was repeated several times, and the product was used in the following polymerization. Prepolymerization treatment Propylene in an amount twice the weight of the titanium catalyst component was polymerized in hexane in the presence of 1.5 mmoles liter of the titanium catalyst component, 6 mmoles liter of triethyl aluminum TRA for short , and 2 mmoles liter of methyl p toluate MPT for short . Gas phase polymerization of propylene Propylene was polymerized by using the catalyst subjected to the prepolymerization treatment in accordance with the flow diagram shown in Figure 1. The reaction conditions were temperature 700 C, pressure 18 kg cm2.G, and the reaction volume 30 liters. The feed rate of the titanium catalyst component subjected to the prepolymerization treatment was 1 mmole hour, and TEA and NPT were fed at a rate of 50 mmoles hour and 12 mmoles hour, respectively. The resulting polymer was continuously taken out at a rate of 10 kg hour. An ordinary anchor type stirrer rotating at a speed of 200 rpm was used. The liquid propylene recycled was sprayed from the top of the reactor, and the amount of the liquid propylene recycle was 45 kg hour. The total amount of the feed propylene and the recycle gas was controlled so that a linear velocity of 4 cm sec was maintained in the reactor. As a result, a polymer having a melt index of 0.05 and an n heptane insoluble content of 98 by weight could be formed stably over a long period of time. Table 1 shows the superiority of a set of the three parameters, i.e. the prepolymerization treatment, the mechanical stirring, and the gas feeding, in accord ance with this invention. Specifically, when the pre polymerization treatment is combined with the mechanical stirring, the polymer has a high bulk density and the fluidization of the polymer powder can be greatly im proved. Furthermore, the polymer has an increased average particle diameter, and the operating condition of the gas phase polymerization is very stable. Furthermore, by combining these parameters with the blowing of gases, the gas phase polymerization process in accordance with this invention can be operated stably over long periods of time.
