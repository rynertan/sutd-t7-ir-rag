# PROCESS FOR MAKING A CORN CHIP WITH POTATO CHIP TEXTURE

## Abstract
A process for making a corn chip with potato chip texture is described. The chip has increased mouthmelt, crispness, and lightness like potato chips and it is less hard and gritty than standard corn chips. It also has a distinctive corn flavour. In a preferred process, corn is cooked in water at 140 F 60 C to 212 F 100 C for 30 minutes to 4 hours. The corn hulls are removed, and the corn is comminuted. A starch material is cooked in water until it is adequately hydrated, and then comminuted. The comminuted corn and starch material are mixed together to form a dough having a ratio of corn to starch material of 95 5 to 80 20. The dough is extruded, formed into a sheet, cut into segments, and deep fried to form the finished chip.
