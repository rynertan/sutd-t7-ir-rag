# A programming circuit for a programmable read only memory.

## Abstract
A program circuit for permanently storing data in a programmable read only memory includes at least one switching means 21, 22, 23, 24 for conducting a program current to a selected bit line, a bit decoder 12 connected to the control inputs S0, S1, ..., S15 of the switching means 21,22,23,24 for selecting a bit line in response to the addressing signals input to the bit decoder 12 and a control current supplying means 25 for supplying a control current to the control inputs of the switching means 21, 22, 23, 24 . This arrangement enables a uniform programming current to be delivered to a selected bit line without passing through circuit elements external to the bit line.
