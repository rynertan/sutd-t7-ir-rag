## Description
This invention relates to a method of fabricating an externally crack free injection molded ceramic article of the type as indicated in the pre characterising portion of claim 1. A method of this type is disclosed in Chemical Abstracts, volume 99 1983, page 302, no 144936b . This publication discloses a method of making ceramic articles, said method comprises injection molding of a blend of ceramic powder and a binder so as to form a green body, embedding said body in a setter powder, decreasing the body through heating at a rate of 5 celsius per hour and buring and sintering the decreased body so as to obtain a defect free silicon nitride ceramic article. The binder composition is merely 20 volume percent of the injection molding formulation. Furthermore there is known from DE A 26 33 309 a method of making a green body by injection molding a blend of ceramic powder and a wax, embedding the thus obtained body in a powder which absorbs the binder material and dewaxing the body so that at least 45 weight percent of the wax is removed before the body reached the vaporisation temperature of the wax. Injection molding of ceramics has been described by several authors in the open literature e.g. T.J. Whalen et al., Ceramics for High Performance Application II, Ed. J.J. Burke, E.N. Lenoe, and R.N. Katz, Brook Hill Publishing Co. 1978, pp. 179 189, J.A. Mangels, Ceramics for High Performance Application II, pp. 113 129, G.D. Schnittgrund, SAMPE Quarterly, p. 8 12, July 1981, etc. and in patent literature e.g. M.A. Strivens, U.S. Patent No. 2939199, 1960, I.A. Crossley et al., U.S. Patent No. 3882210, 1975, R.W. Ohnsorg, U.S. Patent No. 4144207, 1979, etc. . Several papers have also been published by GTE authors e.g. C.L. Quackenbush et al., Contractors Coordination Meeting Proceedings, 1981, G. Bandyopadhyay et al., Contractors Coordination Meeting Proceedings, 1983 . The general process routing for injection molding is well known. It includes a compounding which involves mixing the high surface area ceramic with molten organic binder, b injection molding by which the powder binder mix is formed into a given shape in a metallic mold, c binder removal which must be accomplished without disrupting the ceramic structure, and d consolidation of the part by sintering and or by hot isostatic pressing. Significant effort has been made by various researchers to determine the effects of starting powder particle size and size distribution on moldability of powder, and to identify binder systems that allow easy compounding, molding and binder burnout without disruption from the part. Although volumes of patent literature now exist on powder requirements, different binder concepts and binder removal processes, it is generally recognized that injection molding and binder removal from a large, complex cross section part e.g. rotors for turbine engines poses a very difficult task because of internal and external cracking during burnout. An extensive evaluation of the patent literature reveals that in most cases only small cross section less than 1.00cm parts were considered as examples, or that the cross sections and complexities were not revealed. None of these references described fabrication of large, complex cross section silicon nitride parts, specifically fabricated by injection molding and sintering. GTE Laboratories has developed a process routing which is highly successful for fabrication of good quality small cross section injection molded and sintered parts, such as turbine blades and vanes, in large quantities. Since this development, improvements in binder composition K. French et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,456,713 allowed further simplification of molding and binder removal procedures. This process routing however, failed to produce an externally crack free injection molded ceramic article having a large cross section one centimeter or greater e.g. turbine rotor and turbocharger sized test parts . It has been established that the use of a submicron starting powder, such as silicon nitride containing Y₂O₃ and Al₂O₃, and a binder results in certain fundamental difficulties which causes external and internal cracking in large cross section parts. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to Provide a new and improved method of injection molding, binder removal and densifying a ceramic article having a large cross section which is crack free. A process routing capable of making large, complex cross section parts can always be used for fabrication of small parts. The reverse may not always be true. This object is achieved by the method as defined in claim 1. The inventive method can also be used for fabrication of small parts having cross sections less than one cm. Preferred embodiments and further improvements of the method according to the invention are indicated in the sub claims. The cause of cracks in an injection molded ceramic article appears to be due to capillarity driven migration of liquid binder from the interior of the molded part to its surface. It has been established that the use of a submicron starting powder such as processed silicon nitride containing Y₂O₃ and Al₂O₃ and a wax based binder both of which are used for small cross section parts resulted in certain fundamental difficulties which caused external and internal cracking in large cross section parts. The cracking problem increased with increasing part size and part complexity. The fundamental difficulties arise due to migration of liquid binder driven by capillary action from the interior of the part to its surface. The liquid binder often carries fine submicron silicon nitride particles from the bulk to the surface causing a density gradient, shrinkage gradient and cracking. In addition to fine particle migration, the capillary forces exert an outward drag on all particles causing them to start compaction at the part surface. As a result, the surface becomes rigid and prevents part shrinkage. Thus as the binder loss continues, the interior shrinks away from the rigid surface region causing the formation of cracks. If a region of the surface becomes hard before another region e.g. thick vs. thin section, or top vs. bottom section external cracks form. This understanding of binder loss and cracking mechanisms is the basis for the present invention. The concepts pursued in this invention are as follows This invention for the first time, provides a complete process routing for fabrication of a large cross section injection molded silicon nitride part which is crack free. Table I shows the detailed process routing which has successfully produced crack free, internal as well as external, turbocharger sized test parts having cross sectional dimension up to 1.9 cm. Since, at the present time, silicon nitride powder is not available in the desired particle sizes, conventionally processed powder Si₃N₄ 6 wt Y₃O₃ 2 wt Al₂O₃, designated here as AY6, was calcined and remilled to obtain the desired mean particle size. To obtain a ceramic powder such as AY6, having a desired mean particle size of about 2 to about 12 microns, preferably from about 5 to about 10 microns from a conventionally processed ceramic powder having a mean particle size less than one micron, the conventionally processed ceramic powder is calcined followed by comminuting to obtain the desired particle size. In the case of AY6 powder, the calcining temperature was from about 1400 C to about 1800 C followed by milling for about 6 to about 36 hours as illustrated in Table II as powder numbers 2, 3 and 4. Table II summarizes the surface area, mean and median particle sizes as measured by x ray sedigraph and the weight fraction of less than one micron particles in the powder of the calcined and milled AY6 powders, powder numbers 2, 3 and 4, compared to a control AY6 powder which was not calcined. As Table II indicates, the calcining followed by milling of AY6 powder produces the desired mean particle sizes. The calcined and milled AY6 ceramic powder is compounded with about 34 vol to about 42 vol , preferably from about 37 vol to about 40 vol of a wax based binder such as 90 wt paraffin wax Astor Chemical 1865Q , 5 wt of surfactant Fisher oleic acid A 215 , and 5 wt of epoxy thermosetting material Acme 5144 . The compounding is done in a Bramley two bladed dispersion mixer. The mixing chamber is heated to 80 C. Mixing is continued until the material has a creamy, homogenous appearance. About 2 hours of mixing time subsequent to the initial blending of the particulate and binder materials is sufficient. At this point a vacuum is applied and the mixing continued approximately 45 minutes to remove any entrapped air. The resulting mixture has rheological properties comparable to a thermoplastic material with a softening range of 40 to 75 C. It can be pelletized or granulated according to well known techniques to a uniform particle size suitable as a feed material for injection molding apparatus. The molding is accomplished by known injection molding techniques. Injection molding is usually carried out utilizing the transfer method or the direct injection method. In the transfer method a hydraulic press forces the material from a heated storage chamber, by means of a plunger, through sprues or runners, into a mold. In the direct injection method, the heated mixture is forced directly into the mold, through runners and gates, by either a hydraulic plunger or by reciprocating screw equipment. Either method may be utilized. The compounded material was injection molded into turbocharger sized shapes having cross sections up to 1.9 cm utilizing a 30 ton Trubor injection molding machine. Granulated material was loaded into the storage chamber and preheated to the molding temperature. Optimum molding temperature is usually just above the melting point of the binder composition. Where paraffin wax is the major binder component and epoxy is a minor component, the chamber temperature was 70 72 C. The die was maintained at room temperature 24 C . Molding pressure must be sufficient to force the preheated mixture into all areas of the die. A pressure of 20.68 to 68.95 MPa 3,000 to 10,000 psi is adequate for these materials, die and molding conditions. The shot was injected into the die cavity and the pressure held for ½ minute. The pressure was released, the die opened, and the parts removed from the die. The injection molded green turbocharger sized parts were placed in a tray and embedded in a setter powder of calcined AY6 powder having a surface area BET of 0.2m² g. The binder was removed from the molded parts by heating the embedded parts in a non oxidizing environment such as nitrogen up to a temperature of 450 C to completely remove the binder. During initial heating at 10 C hr or greater in which 15 wt to 20 wt of the binder was removed the setter powder formed a thick cake around the part. The cake prevented further binder loss until the temperature was sufficiently high, approximately 400 C up to 450 C, to break down the barrier by the thermal decomposition and vaporization of the binder. Thus, the majority of the binder loss occurred after a temperature of 400 C was obtained and up to 450 C. The temperature of 450 C was then raised to 600 C and the heating was continued at 600 C for up to 20 hours in air to remove the residual binder or carbon from the part. For turbocharger sized test parts about 3 days of thermal treatment was sufficient to completely remove the binder. For larger than turbocharger sized cross section parts, a substantially lower heating rate, as low as 1 C hr may be required or a total thermal treatment of approximately 17 days. The part was then cooled to room temperature. The resulting turbocharger sized part was free of external cracks. Other low surface area powder stable up to 600 C could behave similar to silicon nitride setter powder and thus may be equally effective for burnout, binder removal, purposes. The use of a calcined and milled powder as specified in Table II and a silicon nitride setter powder successfully eliminated external cracks from more than 30 turbocharger sized test parts having cross sections up to 1.9 cm. The binder free turbocharger sized part was then prefired to a temperature up to 1400 C, cooled to room temperature, and cold isostatically pressed, isopressed, in a flexible rubber bag from pressure of 34.47 up to 344.71 MPa 5000 psi up to 50,000 psi . However, the pressures greater than 344.71 MPa 50,000 psi can be used. To prevent sticking of the rubber bag to the part a boron nitride lubricating layer can be used. The alternative process is to isopress the binder free part which is generally fragile and requires careful handling without prefiring. However, prefiring is recommended for a complex part because it provides the strength necessary for handling and isopressing. Instead of using rubber bags which may be cumbersome for a complex cross section part e.g. automotive gas turbine rotor , thin elastomer conformal coatings e.g. commercially available plastisol, PVA, acrylics, or waxes having a thickness equal to or greater than 0.20mm could be used. The thin coatings can be applied by various methods such as dipping, spraying, brushing, etc. After the coated part is isostatically pressed and removed from the press, the thin coating is removed prior to the sintering step. The thin coating has been removed successfully by a burn off cycle to 550 C as well as removal by peeling. The isopressed part can then be sintered in a conventional manner to provide 99 of theoretical density. Table III gives some examples of crack free. turbocharger sized samples fabricated via this process routing. Cracks, internal as well as external, could not be eliminated without the use of an appropriate starting material, a proper setter and an isopressing operation. In the process routing, as shown in Table I, four areas are considered critical for fabrication of large, complex shapes starting powder, binder removal setter powder, prefiring, and isopressing. The concepts that are used in the present invention are believed to be new and novel. The concept of isopressing a molded part which has binder removed burnout with or without prefiring can be used to improve the reliability of all ceramics of any shape and size and prepared by methods other than injection molding e.g. slip casting .
