# Apparatus for mounting a character carrying disc in a printing machine.

## Abstract
The apparatus for mounting a daisy wheel character carry ing disc 70 in a printing machine comprises a frame 22 which is pivoted on a guide 13 of the carriage 12 that is par allel to the platen roller 11 and on which are mounted a selec tor motor 15 with which the character carrying disc is to be coupled, a striker hammer 16 and a pocket 60 into which the character carrying disc is inserted. A manually actuable mecha nism 40 causes the frame 22 , striker hammer 16 and the selector motor 15 to swing away from the platen roller 11 and at the same time causes the pocket 60 to be lifted, thus permitting the character carrying disc 70 to be removed and or inserted from above. Coaxial coupling between the mo tor shaft 76 and the disc 70 and positioning of the disc be tween the platen roller and the striker hammer are effected automatically by manually actuating the mechanism 40 con nected to the frame 22 to swing the frame back again to wards the platen.
