# Electrically conducting material and process of preparing same.

## Abstract
An electrically conducting material including a cyanic group containing material having adsorbed thereby sul phides of copper and an auxiliary metal selected from silver, gold and elements of the platinum group. The cyanic group containing material is in the form of powder or a shaped body such as fibre, film, plate, rod or like and is formed of a synthetic polymer such as polyacrylonitrile or a polyamide having introduced thereinto cyanic groups a naturally occurring polymeric substance such as cotton having introduced thereinto cyanic groups or a low molecu lar compound such as phthalonitrile. The electrically con ducting material may be prepared by treating the cyanic group containing material with a a source of monovalent copper ions, b a source of ions containing the auxiliary metal and c a sulphur containing compound to form sulphides of copper and the auxiliary metal adsorbed by the cyanic group containing material.
