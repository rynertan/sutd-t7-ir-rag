## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONGroup B Streptococcal Capsular PolysaccharidesBackground of the Invention Group B Streptococcus Streptococcus agalactiae has recently been identified as the leading cause of meningitis among neonates and young infants. A conservative estimation C.J. Baker, J. InfectiousDiseases, 136, No. 1, 137 1977 1 indicates that about 12,000 to 15,000 infants will be affected annually. Half of them will die. Those who survive may develop fatal neurological sequelae that often progress too far to be arrested by antibiotic treatments. For this reason, the immunological, preventive approach as embodied in vaccination of Group B streptococcal type specific polysaccharides has evolved as one of the most important aspects for future control of the disease.In addition, antibody specific to type Ia Streptococcus agalactiae has recently been found in the glands of bovine immunized with killed or live vaccine, indicating that Group B streptococcal type specific polysaccharides may be important in vaccination against mastitis in dairy mammals, for example, dairy cattle. Group B streptococcal antigens are generally classified into five serotypes Ia, Ib, Icw II andIII based on capillary precipitin tests with hydrochloric acid extracted antigens and type specific hyperimmune rabbit antisera. Although later studies have shown chemical compositions indicating structures quite different from those reported originally, the same serological classification, i.e., Ia, Ib, Ic, II and III for streptococcal polysaccharides, are still being followed. For example, type specific polysaccharides isolated via HCl treatment of whole organisms was reported to contain rhamnose, glucosamine, and galactose, while type specific polysaccharides prepared by TCA trichloroacetic acid extraction contained an additional antigenic determinant, sialic acid.Furthermore, structural difference may also arise from variation of fermentation conditions. ThusGroup B Streptococcal polysaccharides isolated by identical methods from organisms grown in the presence of excess glucose has been found to contain no rhamnose as previously reported. The present invention is related to novelGroup B streptococcal polysaccharide types Ia Ib II and III, all of which contain galactose, glucosamine, glucose, and sialic acid. They are structurally distinguishable from those reported earlier as a result of variation in fermentation conditions, methods of isolation and purification. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention 1 to provide highly purified antigenicGroup B streptococcal polysaccharide types Ia, Ib, II and III of novel structures 2 to provide a vaccine for neonates or infants against Group B Streptococcus infections, for example, meningitis, containing at least one of the novel Group B streptococcal polysaccharides 3 to provide a method for the prevention of neonatal diseases induced by Group B Streptococcus by vaccination of pregnant women or women of childbearing age 4 to provide a novel method for the isolation and purification of the Group B streptococcal polysaccharides 5 to provide a vaccine containing one or more of the type specific Group B streptococcal polysaccharides for protection against mastitis in dairy mammals 6 to provide a method for protection against Group BStreptococcus infections by passive vaccination of patients with impaired immune system and 7 to provide a method for protection against mastitis in dairy mammals by passive vaccination.Detailed Description of the Invention Antigenic Group B streptococcal polysaccharide types Ia, Ib, II and III have been isolated having the specifications shown below in Table I based on dry weight analysis.

Type 1a is composed of hexose, glucosamine, and sialic acid in the approximate molar ratio 3 1 1, having a molecular weight of about 0.8 x 106 daltons. Type Ib contains the same components in the approximate molar ratio 3 1 1, having a molecular weight of about 0.5 x 106 daltons. Type II contains the same components in the approximate molar ratio 5 1 1, having a molecular weight of about 0.5 x 106 daltons. Type III contains the same components in the approximate molar ratio 3 1 1, having a molecular weight of about 0.15 x 106 daltons. The purified type specific polysaccharides be they type Iat Ib, II or III, are composed of galatose, glucosamine, glucose and sialic acid. Very small amounts of protein, nucleic acid, phosphoru, uronic acid and acetate are also present. The polysaccharides can be isolated from any group B type specific strain, but preferably from the following strains which are on unrestricted deposit in the American Culture Collections ATCC .Type Merck No. ATCC No. Ia MB 4052 31,574 Ib MB 4053 31,575 II MB 4055 31,576III MB 4082 31,577 MB 4316 M 732 31,475 The most preferable strain for type III isM 732. The preparation of antigenic polysaccharides generally comprises 1 inoculating the bacteria into a modified HySoy nutrient medium containing an excess amount of glucose about 2.5 to 5 by weight 2 separating the cell paste from the supernatant after phenolizing the fermentation broth 3 isolating the crude type specific polysaccharide either by chemical precipitation or by precipitation after enzyme digestion and 4 purifying the crude polysaccharides by ammonium or sodium sulfate precipitation types 1a and Ib only followed by, if desired, column chromatography with an appropriate gel material as the stationary phase. The commonly used gel materials includingBio Gel P 300, Sepharose 4B, Sepharose 6B, Whatman s DEAE cellulose DE 52 or the like are found to be satisfactory. Inoculation of the bacteria is accomplished by culturing a Group B Streptococcus type specific strain, for example, MB 4055, type II, ATCC No.31576 in an inoculum medium such as Fluid Thioglycollate Medium FTM . The FTM culture obtained is in turn used to inoculate a second inoculum medium which is free of animal protein and contains the necessary nutrients for the growth of the bacteria.For example, the preferred medium contains about 15 to 25 g per liter Hysoy Humko Sheffield , about 5 to 15 g per liter Amberex 1003 Amber , about 2.5 to 7.5 g per liter sodium chloride or potassium chloride, about 1 to 5 g per liter potassium or sodium phosphate dibasic K2HPO4 or Na2HPO4 , about 0.01 g per liter phenol red and about 10 to 50 g per liter glucose in distilled water at pH 6 to 8, preferably 6.8 to 7.4. After a subsequent 9 liter inoculation, the culture which is assured of its purity according to conventional methods see Example 1, infra , is inoculated for the large scale production fermentation. The production medium is essentially the same as the inoculum medium except that phenol red is displaced with 8 UCON LB 625 solution seeTable II, for definition to prevent foam formation. The more preferable medium is the medium which contains about 20 g per liter HySoy, about 5 g per liter sodium chloride, about 2.5 g per liter potassium phosphate dibasic, about 10 g per literAmberex 1003 and about 25 g per liter about 2.58 by weight glucose in apyrogenic water at pH 6.9 to 7.4. More specifically, the most preferable medium for type III polysaccharide contains the same amount of ingredients as described above. However, a solution of HySoy and Amberex 1003 yeast extract in about 50 ml of distilled water is dialyzed first with a molecular weight cut off at about 12,000 to 14,000 before the resulting dialysate is mixed with other components, diluted to about 750 to 1000 ml with apyrogenic water, and adjusted to pH 7.2 before sterilization. Generally the fermentation is conducted at about 34 to 390C, preferably at 370C, until the fermentation is complete, usually from about 3 hours to about 48 hours. Under optimum conditions, the fermentation is over within 24 hours. After the fermentation is complete, it is stopped by addition of about 0.5 to 2.08 by weight of phenol followed by collection of the cells via centrifugation or filtration, preferably by centrifugation. In most cases, the cell paste is discarded except where enzymatic digestion is used to prepare polysaccharide type Ia or Ib from the cells see Example 2, infra .The preferable method in volves 1 treating the supernatant or filtrate with a strong ionic salt such as calcium chloride, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, or potassium chloride, preferably calcium chloride 2 diluting the solution with a lower alkanol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, or butanol, preferably ethanol 20 to 50 by volume to precipitate most of the inactive impurities such as nucleic acids and 3 precipitating from the supernatant obtained above the desired crude type specific polysaccharide by addition of a water miscible lower alkanol, preferably ethanol 35 to 75 by volume . The most preferable conditions for removal of impurities and precipitation of the crude typespecific polysaccharides including types I Ia, Ib, II and III are as follows Precipitation of Removal of Impurities Crude Polysaccharide 0.1M CaC12 in 40 44 by CaC12 ca. 0.07M in volume aqueous ethanol 44 61 by volume aqueous ethanol Although each crude type specific polysaccharide may be precipitated under substantially similar conditions as shown above, further purifications requires different procedures.Crude types Ia and Ib polysaccharides are further purified by 1 suspension in an appropriate amount of an aqueous solution of an inert salt, for example, about 0.5 to 5 by weight of aqueous sodium acetate or ammonium acetate or the like, preferably 1 by weight aqueous sodium acetate 2 removal of insoluble impurities by centrifugation or filtration and 3 saturation of the supernatant with an inert salt such as sodium sulfate potassium sulfate, or ammonium sulfate, preferably ammonium sulfate, to salt out the semi purified polysaccharide. The semi purified polysaccharide types 1a and Ib are subsequently purified by gel chromatography.Any commonly used gels for chromatography can be used. For example, dextran gels, polyacrylamide gels, agarose gels, macroreticular polystyrene gels, cross linked polymethylmetaacrylate gels,Bio gel p 300 Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, California , and Sepharose commat 4B or 6B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals . The preferred gel for isolating types 1a and Ib is Sepharose 6B or 4B. Generally the semi purified material is extracted with a minimum amount of about 0.5 to 2.5 aqueous sodium acetate, preferably about 1 by weight aqueous sodium acetate. After centrifugation, the clear supernatant is eluted with an aqueous solution of about 0.5 to 2.5 preferably 1 by weight sodium acetate, containing about 0.02 by weight sodium borate, sodium azide or other preservatives. The pH of the eluant is preadjusted to about 7.0. Active fractions determined by the Ouchterlony double immunodifussion technique are combined and the pooled material is concentrated to an appropriate volume at a moderate temperature preferably at 250 C. To obtain the highly purified polysaccharide, the concentrate is first dialyzed against distilled water for about 4 hours.A second dialysis against 0.01 to 0.03 by weight aqueous sodium acetate, preferably 0.02 , is conducted at about 40C for about 10 to 48 hours or until the dialysis is substantially complete. The dialyzed concentrate is freeze dried to afford the purified product. Alternatively, type i or i a b polysaccharide may be purified by the formation of cetavlon hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide complex. Under this procedure, the concentrated, combined active fractions are treated with a sufficient amount of cetavlon to form a gel like precipitate which in turn is dissolved in a minimum volume of 1.0 to 10 by weight, preferably 5 by weight aqueous sodium acetate.About 2 to 4 volumes of water miscible alcohol, preferably 3 volumes of ethanol are added to precipitate the purified polysaccharide. The purified polysaccharide, if desired, may be further purified by 1 dissolution in a buffer solution at pH about 8 to 9, preferably a borate buffer at 8.5, and 2 elution through a cellulosepacked column, for example, a Whatman s DEAE Cellulose DE 52 column. Active fractions are pooled, concentrated and dialyzed. The resulting retentate is freezed dried to afford the final product. As to types II and III, crude polysaccharides are precipitated similarily as types 1a and Ib.However, after the initial precipitation, the crude product is suspended in an appropriate amount of an aqueous solution of an inert salt, for example, about 0.5 to 2.5 by weight aqueous sodium acetate or ammonium acetate, preferably 0.1 aqueous sodium acetate. A sufficient amount of trypsin about 1 mg to 10 mg 100 ml of the suspension is added and the mixture is incubated at about 340C to 380C, preferably at 370C, for about 0.5 to 2 hours or until the digestion is substantially complete. During the incu bation, the pH is maintained at about 8.0 to about 8.5.Semipurified polysaccharides types II and III are subsequently obtained by the calcium chlorideethanol precipitation as described above for types Ia and Ib. For further purification, column chromatography with an agarose gel, for example Sepharose 4B, Sepharose 6B, or Bio gel P 300 is used. The eluate is subsequently treated with calcium chlorideethanol to precipitate the polysaccharide which in turn is dissolved in a minimum amount of basic buffer solution of pH at about 8 to 9, preferably a borate buffer at pH 8.5. The resulting solution is eluted through a cellulose packed column, for example, a column packed with a sufficient amount of wet Whatman s DEAE cellulose DE 52 . Active fractions are pooled and concentrated by evaporation of the solvents followed by dialysis.The dialyzed concentrate is usually freeze dried to afford the purified polysaccharide as a white powder. A vaccine for humans may be prepared by incorporating an effective amount of one or more purified Group B Streptococcus type specific polysaccharides into a suitable physiologically acceptable medium, for example, saline, water, or phosphate buffered saline. The dosage of a monovalent vaccine and frequency of administration vary according to the age and physical condition of a patient and is up to the judgment of the clinician. Usually the dose varies from about 25 Wg to about 250 Wg of the polysaccharide in about 0.2 ml to 1.0 ml sterile saline or the like. Generally, one or two subcutaneous administrations are sufficient to provide adequate protection against Group BStreptococcus infections. In some cases, in the judgment of the clinician, it may be advantageous to prepare a polyvalent vaccine containing an effective amount of two or more selected types of Group B streptococcal type specific polysaccharides, for example, a trivalent vaccine containing types Ia, II and III or a tetravalent vaccine containing types Ia, Ib, II and III. Dosage and administration of a polyvalent vaccine is substantially similar to that of a monovalent vaccine subject to the judgment of the clinician. Generally, the amount of each polysaccharides is from about 25 Wg to 250 Wg per dose. Similar dosages are used in administrating a vaccine against mastitis in dairy mammals especially dairy cattle. However, an adjuvant the role of which is to assure high immune response is usually required. The adjuvant may be any compound or composition selected from the group consisting of aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate for example, ALHYDOGEL CR, , Superfos Export Cho , Copenhagen, Denmark. Alternatively, protection against Group BStreptococcus induced infection can be established by passive vaccination, i.e., by giving preformed antibody or homologous y globulin from another individual of the same or a different species. The preformed antibody or y globulin used for passive vaccination is usually obtained from another individual who was vaccinated actively with the vaccines of the present invention. The following examples illustrate the present invention. EXAMPLE 1FERMENTATION OF STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP B BACTERIA NON DIALYZED MEDIUM Step A Culture Streptococcus Group B type Ia, Ib, II, and III were received by Merck s Rahway Stock Culture Collection RSCC from Dr. R. Lancefield, RockefellerUniversity, New York, New York and were designated as Merck MB 4052, MB 4053, MB 4055 and MB 4082, respectively. The cultures were preserved as lyophilized cultures in the RSCC and have been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection ATCC and thereby assigned ATCC numbers 31574, 31575, 31576 and 31577, respectively. Another TypeIII culture, M 732 ATCC No. 31,475 , which is available on unrestricted deposit with the American TypeCulture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, was designated as Merck MB 4316. Step B Inoculum Development A lyophilized L tube containing one of the cultures type Ia obtained from the RSCC was suspended in 1.0 ml of BBL Fluid Thioglycollate Medium FTM, see Table I, 1, on pg. 17 and 1.0 ml of the resulting suspension was transferred into a test tube containing 9 ml of FTM and incubated at 370C for 6 hours. After incubation the culture was examined microscopically and streaked on YED see Table II, 2 plates to check for purity. Small colonies typical of Group B Streptococcus were observed on the YED plate and numerous streptococcal chains typical ofGroup B Streptococcus were also observed microscopically. Five ml of the FTM culture obtained above was used to inoculate 1 liter of inoculum medium seeTable II, 3 in a 2 liter Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was incubated stationarily for about 9 to 12 hours at 370C and about 4 to 12 hours at 40C. The pH of the fermentation was adjusted periodically by the addition of 12 aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The 1 liter fermentation utilized about 80 to 100 ml of the sodium bicarbonate solution. Before the next inoculation, a sample was 1 applied on a YED plate to check its purity 2 observed microsocpically and 3 examined for precipitin reaction with Group B streptococcal antiserum see Table II, 6 . Small colonies typical of Group BStreptococcus, were viewed on the YED the cells were streptococcal formation when examined microscopically and a single precipitin reaction withGroup B antiserum was observed on the Ouchterlony plates. The culture which was assured of its purity was used to inoculate a 14 liter fermentor MA 114 New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, New Jersey containing 9 liters of inoculation medium see Table II, 4 . The batch was incubated at 370C with mild agitation 100 rpm without aeration. Throughout the cultivation, samples were examined for optical density O.D. and pH values. The final O.D. before inoculating the production stage was about 2.0 to 5.0. The pH was maintained at about 7.0 during fermentation by the periodical addition of 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide.After the final sodium hydroxide addition, the fermentation was terminated total time 3 hrs. . A total of 150 ml of aqueous sodium hydroxide 10 was utilized. Before inoculating the production fermentor, samples again were taken for purity YED , Group B specificity precipitin reaction on Ouchterlony , and microscopic examination. Based upon these examinations, which revealed only streptococcal forms, the production fermentor was inoculated as described in the next step.Step C Production of Fermentation Broth Approximately 10 liters of the culture obtained from Step B was used to inoculate a 250 liter fermentor FM 250, New Brunswick Scientific containing 175 liters of production medium see Table II, 5 .The conditions for growth were 370C, 100 rpm agitation, and no aeration. Throughout the cultivation the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide and samples were taken at 2 hr. intervals for optical density O.D. and pH measurements.When the pH remained constant at about 7.0 without further additions of sodium hydroxide, the fermentation was stopped. Prior to harvesting, the culture was plated onYED, examined microscopically, checked by Gram stain see Table II, 7 , and examined for group specificity by Ouchterlony reaction. There were small colonies on the YED plate the cells were in streptococcal formation when observed under the microscope theGram stain was positive and a single precipitin reaction occurred. These results indicated that the fermentation broth was ready for harvest and inactivation. It was inactivated via addition of phenol 1 by weight . Following substantially the same procedure as described in Example 1, but substituting for the type Ia culture used therein culture type Ib, II, orIII, there was obtained the corresponding type Ib, type II or type III fermentation broth.

EXAMPLE 3PREPARATION OF GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS POLYSACCHARIDETYPE 1a VIA ENZYMATIC DIGESTION OF THE CELL PASTEStep 1 Enzymatic digestion of Cell Paste The wet cell paste 105 g wet weight obtained from the phenolized fermentation broth Example 1 by centrifugation was suspended in 1.6 liters of 0.1 M sodium acetate with a final pH adjustment to 6.5. The resulting suspension was subsequently charged with 0.02 by weight of sodium azide as a preservative. The system underwent lysis with 4,000 azocase in units of Endopeptidase Calgon FormulationNo. 6859 113 005B followed by incubation at 370C for 36 hr.The resulting digest 11.8 liters was stored at 20C. Aliquots were taken 1 for serological studies to confirm the presence of typespecific polysaccharide type 1a by the Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion technique against homologus antisera Merck, Sharp Dohme Research Laboratories and 2 for ethanol fractionation to determine the ethanol ranges which would precipitate the typespecific polysaccharide type 1a with the aid of the serological study described in 1 . It was found that 44 vol vol ethanol would effectively precipitate the type Ia polysaccharide.Step 2 Preparation of Crude Type 1a Polysaccharide The digest from step 1 1.8 liters was treated with an aqueous solution of calcium chloride 1.1 g ml or 0.1 M . Sufficient amount of ethanol was added at room temperature about 20 250C until the bulk solution contained about 44 ethanol by volume. The resulting precipitates which consisted of impurities such as calcium nucleinates and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes Sorvall model RC 2B . The supernatant was then diluted with ethanol to a concentration of 60 vol vol in ethanol in order to precipitate the crude type 1a polysaccharide.After sufficient time was allowed for the resulting flocculent precipitate to settle, most of the supernatant was siphoned off, and the crude product was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The crude type I polysaccharide was suspended with a 200 ml of ethanol in a Waring blender. It was subsequently filtered, washed with 1 x 200 ml of ethanol and 1 x 200 ml of acetone. After drying under vacuum in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride overnight, there was obtained 2.42 g of crude type 1a polysaccharide.Step 3 Purification of Crude Type 1a Polysaccharide by Molecular Sieving Chromatography The crude type a polysaccharide 1 g in about 10 ml of 0.58 sodium acetate pH 6.5 containing 0.02 sodium azide solution A was chromatographed through a column of Bio Gel P 300 Bio Rad Laboratories,Richwood, California with solution A as eluant at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min. The elution was monitored serologically by the Ouchterlony technique. To precipitate the purified product, fractions containing the product were combined and diluted with 3 volumes of isopropyl alcohol.After standing at ambient temperature for about one hour, the supernatant was decanted, and the precipitate was triturated with 200 ml of ethanol in a Waring blender, followed by filtration and subsequent washes with ethanol 100 ml and acetone 100 ml . The wet product was dried in vacuo over anhydrous calcium chloride to give 0.74 g of group B Streptococcus polysaccharide type 1a EXAMPLE 4PREPARATION OF GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS POLYSACCHARIDETYPE 1a FROM THE CELL FREE BROTH VIA CHEMICAL ISOLATIONStep 1 Preparation of Cell Free Fermentation Broth The phenolized fermentation broth containing 1 by weight of phenol from Example 1 was cleared of cells buy centrifugation in a Sharples UltracentrifugeModel T 1 P. The supernatant, 20 liters, was charged with calcium chloride dihydrate CaC12 2H2O to 0.1 M in CaC12 and with denatured ethanol to 44 by volume in ethanol. The alcohol was added in 100 ml lots per minute with adequate stirring at room temperature.The resulting suspension was allowed to stand for 4 hours and subsequently centrifuged in the SharplesUltracentrifuge. The feeding rate of the suspension was adjusted to about 150 ml per minute to assure clarity of the effluent which was substantially free of nucleic acid and other inactive materials.Step 2 Precipitation of Crude Type Specific Polysaccharide The effluent from Step 1 was charged with additional ethanol until it contained 60 by volume ethanol. A flocculent precipitate formed after standing overnight. The crude material was collected by siphoning off most of the clear supernatant followed by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 200C in a Sorvall centrifuge, Model RC 5. The resulting pellet of crude type specific polysaccharide was suspended in 300 ml of 1 by weight aqueous sodium acetate. Usually, it required about 4 hours with mild stirring to achieve complete suspension. Insolubles were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 40C in a Sorvall centrifuge, Model RC 5. The supernatant 325 ml con taining the desired polysaccharide type a was treated with 200 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate 86 saturation with adequate agitation. Since the saltedout material tended to rise to the surface, the entire system was degassed under mild vacuum in order to facilitate the precipitation. After standing overnight at 40C, the precipitated crude polysaccharide type 1a was collected by centrifugation in the usual manner as described above. Step 3 Isolation of Group B Streptococcus polysaccharide Type Ia by Sepharose 6B Chromatography The salted out material from step 2 was extracted with 30 ml of 1 aqueous sodium acetate to give a viscous solution. The remaining turbidity was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 40C. The almost clear supernatant ca. 30 ml was applied to a Sepharose 6B column with a bed volume of 5.6 x 90 cm preequilibrated with the eluant 1 sodium acetate containing 0.02 sodium azide as a preservative, with a pH of 7.3 . Fractions 12.5 ml . were collected with maximal flow rate of ca. 1 ml per minute. The elution was monitored by 1 refractive index changes Waters Associates , and 2 by theOuchterlony double immunodiffusion technique for serological activity. It was found that peak serological activity coincided with a refractive index peak. The serologically active fractions were pooled and was reduced in volume to ca. 30 ml in a hollow fiber device, No. 80, 100 ml beaker, Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Cal. . The ionic strength of the pooled fractions was reduced to less than 0.25 by flushing with apyrogenic water. By backflushing the device with about 70 ml of water, the combined active fractions were efficiently recovered with a total volume of about 100 ml and were used directly in the next step.Step 4 Further Purification of Group B Streptococcus polysaccharide type 1a via Cetavlon Complex Formation The pooled active fractions 100 ml from Step 3 was charged with 300 mg of cetavlon. A glassy gel like precipitate was formed and was collected at once by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. at 40C Sorvall, Model RC 5 . To test for the completeness of the complex formation and to assure that the initially existing ionic strength of foreign ions was not too high, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against a 1 by weight aqueous solution 500 ml of cetavlon. The completeness of the complex formation was indicated by the lack of further complex formation, i.e., the supernatant stayed clear after the test. The complex was suspended in 20 ml of 5 sodium acetate to give a clear, slightly viscous, colorless solution. The desired polysaccharide type 1a was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. A heavy, flocculent precipitate resulted and the supernatant decanted. The precipitate was washed with 250 ml of ethanol to remove any sodium acetate remaining in the precipitate. It was further washed with acetone, and air dried. The resulting powder was transferred into a 100 ml round bottom flask and dissolved in 20 ml of 0.02 sodium acetate. The clear solution was dialyzed against 1 liter of water and the dialyzed concentrate was freeze dried to afford 205 mg of purified Group BStreptococcus polysaccharide, type 1a Following substantially the same procedure ofExample 4 but substituting for the type 1a specific antiserum used therein for the Ouchterlony double immunodiffussion technique for serological activity, the type 1b specific antiserum, there was obtained 5 10 mg liter of broth of purified Group BStreptococcus type Ib polysaccharide. EXAMPLE 5PREPARATION OF PURIFIED GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS POLYSACCHARIDE, TYPE Ib Step 1 Preparation of Cell Free Fermentation Broth At the end of the fermentation cycle, the broth was phenolized to contain 1 by volume of phenol.Cells were subsequently removed by centrifugation in a Sharples supercentrifuge, Model T 1 P, and the supernatant was stored at 40C overnight.Step 2 Precipitation of the crude Group B Streptococcus Polysaccharide, Type 1b The cold supernatant 10 1 from step 1 was charged with calcium chloride dihydrate until its concentration reached 0.1 M. The temperature of the supernatant rose to about 150C due to the exothermic solubilization of the salt. Without cooling, a sufficient amount of ethanol was added with stirring until the resulting mixture contained 60 by volume of ethanol and the precipitation of impurities began. After standing at room temperature for 24 hours, the supernatant was decanted, and the precipitate was collected at 200C by centrifugation for 10 min. at 5,000 rpm.The wet precipitate 280 ml was suspended in 5 volumes 1400 ml of 0.5 by weight aqueous sodium acetate followed by treatment with calcium chloride and ethanol to give a final mixture containing 0.1 mole liter of calcium chloride and 44 by volume ethanol. The ethanol addition was carried out at a rate of 10 ml min. with adequate stirring. After standing for 2 hours at ambient temperature, the precipitate calcium nucleinates was discarded by centrifugation, and the ethanol content of the clear supernatant was adjusted to 60 by volume with additional amount of ethanol. The resulting suspension was allowed to stand overnight to precipitate most of the desired polysaccharide, type Ib. Upon centrifugation, a wet pellet of crude polysaccharide was collected.Step 3 Precipitation of semi purified Polysaccharide with Ammonium Sulfate The pellets were suspended in 300 ml of 1 aqueous sodium acetate. Insoluble were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 40C in a Sorvall centrifuge, model RC 5. The volume of the supernatant was noted and the extract partially saturated 85 saturation with anhydrous ammonium sulfate to salt out the polysaccharide. The suspension was degased in a desicator under vacuum followed by standing at 40C overnight.The precipitated polysaccharide was collected by centrifugation as described above.Step 4 Preparation of Purified Polysaccharide type 1b by Chromatography The precipitates from Step 3 were extracted with 20 ml of 1 aqueous sodium acetate with insolubles removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes and at 40C. The clear supernatant 10 ml was applied to a column of Sepharose 6B 2.6 x 90 cm and developed with 1 aqueous sodium acetate containing 0.02 sodium azide as preservative. Fractions of 12 ml each were collected flow rate ca. 3 fractions min. . The elution was monitored for type Ib polysaccharide by the Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion technique. The serologically active fractions were pooled and concentrated to ca.20 ml by evaporation. The concentrate was dialyzed for 4 hours against 1 liter of distilled water followed by 18 hours against 2 liters of 0.02 by weight aqueous sodium acetate 40C. The dialyzed concentrate was freeze dried to afford 235 mg. of purified groupB Streptococcus polysaccharide, type Ib. EXAMPLE 6PREPARATION OF GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS POLYSACCHARIDETYPE Ia Employing substantially similar procedures as described in Example 5, Steps 1 4, but using type 1a broth and substituting for the antiserum used therein for monitoring polysaccharide type Ib, the appropriate amount of polysaccharide type Ia specific antiserum for detecting the type 1a serologically active fractions, there was prepared 25 mg of purified Group B Streptococcus polysaccharide, type Ia. EXAMPLE 7PREPARATION OF GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS TYPE III POLY SACCHARINE Step 1 Isolation of Crude Group B StreptococcusType III Polysaccharide Employing essentially the same procedures ofExample 4, Steps 1 and 2, there was obtained the crude type III polysaccharide precipitate from the phenolized fermentation broth of Example 1. It was suspended in 200 ml of 1 by weight aqueous sodium acetate pH 8.5 to give a slightly cloudy solution. Five miligrams of highly purified trypsin Wortington Co.,Freehold, N.J. were added followed by incubation at 370C for 1 hr. pH value of the solution was maintained at 8.0 to 8.5 during the incubation period. The resulting digest was cooled to about 0 10 C. Precalculated amount of solid calcium chloride and ethanol were added so as to make the final concentration of the solution 0.1 M in calcium chloride and 61 v v in ethanol. A suspension resulted. It was allowed to stand overnight for complete precipitation.After the clear supernatant was decanted, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation 5 minutes at 5,000 rpm, 200C . Step 2 Purification of Group B Streptococcus Polysaccharide Type III The crude precipitates obtained in step 1 was extracted with 10 ml of 1 aqueous sodium acetate.After centrifugation, the clear supernatant was applied to a 2.6 x 90 cm Sepharose 6B column Pharmacia Co.,Piscataway, N.J. and was eluted with 1 by weight aqueous sodium acetate containing 0.02 by weight of sodium azide, a preservative agent. Twelve milimeter fractions were collected at a flow rate of 3 fractions per hour. The elution was followed by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion techinque against type III specific rabbit antiserum and serologically active fractions were identified and pooled. It was diluted with four volumes of ethanol to precipitate semipurified type III polysaccharide which in turn was centrifuged upon completion of the precipitation. The pellet was successively washed with ethanol and acetone. It was dried under vacuum in the presence of anhydrous calcium chloride to afford 65 mg of semipurified product.Step 3 Final Purification of Group B StreptococcusPolysaccharide Type III by DEAE Cellulose ColumnChromatography The semi purified polysaccharide from step 2 was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.05 M borate buffer pH 8.5 and applied to a 1.0 cm x 30 cm column packed with 20 g of wet Whatman s DEAE cellulose DE 52 preequilibrated with 0.05 M sodium borate at pH 8.5. Under these conditions the type III polysaccharide will associate with the cellulose, while remaining impurities will wash through. For this reason, theDEAE cellulose column was washed with 200 ml of 0.05 M sodium borate .pH 8.5 to remove most of the impurities. Subsequently, the type III polysaccharide associated with the cellulose was eluted with 0.2 M aqueous sodium chloride in 0.05 M sodium borate buffer at pH 8.5. Fractions of 5 ml were collected and the emergence of the type III polysaccharide was monitored by the Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion technique against type III specific antiserum. Active fractions were pooled and were concentrated by evaporation to about 20 ml and the concentrate was dialyzed for 24 hours against 0.02 by weight sodium acetate at 40C.The dialyzed concentrate was freeze dried to give 35 mg of purified Group B Streptocuccus polysaccharide typeIII. Following substantially the same procedure as described in Example 7, but substituting for the type III specific antiserum used therein for monitoring polysaccharide type III, the type Il specific antiserum for detecting the serologically active fractions, there was prepared 230 mg of purified Group BStreptococcus polysaccharide, type II. EXAMPLE 8PREPARATION OF GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS TYPE III POLYSACCHARIDE FROM CELL FREE BROTH OBTAINED FROM FERMENTATION IN DIALYZED MEDIUM Following substantially similar procedures as described in Example 7, Steps 1 to 3, but substituting for the phenolized fermentation broth used therein, the fermentation broth obtained from Example 2, there was prepared 300 mg of purified Group B Streptococcus polysaccharide type III. EXAMPLE 9 VACCINE DOSAGE FORM One tenth gram of the purified polysaccharide type III was suspended in 500 ml of pyrogen free distilled water. The suspension was sterile filtered and packed in vials, 5 ml per vial for 10 doses or 100 Wg per dose. The vaccine so obtained may be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly to expecting mothers or women of child bearing age. EXAMPLE 10 VACCINE DOSAGE FORM Two tenth grams each of the purified polysaccharide types II and III were added with sufficient stirring and under aseptic conditions to 1.5 liters of pyrogenfree saline 0.85 by weight . After the addition, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional 2 to 5 minutes, and sterile filtered. The clear filtrate was distributed into 10 ml vials which were either sealed or tightly stopped under aseptic conditions. Each vial contained 5 ml of the filtered vaccine corresponding to 10 doses about 60 to 65 Wg dose for injection. EXAMPLE 11 POLYVALENT VACCINE A polyvalent vaccine was prepared by adding under aseptic conditions at room temperature the following amounts of capsular polysaccharide to 4 liters of pyrogen free saline 0.85 . The polysac charides were added individually at 15 second intervals while stirring continuously in a blender. After the addition was complete, the stirring was continued for another 2 to 3 minutes.Type Amount gram Ia 1.6005 1b 0.8210 II 0.6005III 1.2400 4.2620 The mixture was subsequently sterile filtered and packaged in vials, 5 ml 10 doses per vial, i.e., about 75 Wg type II to 200 Wg type Ia per dose.

EXAMPLE 12 RELEASE PROTOCOL FOR GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS TYPE Ia POLYSACCHARIDE, PRODUCT 11059 113Step 1 Isolation of First Crude Product Sixty 60 liters of whole, phenolized broth were charged with 885 gm of calcium chloride, dihydrate to 0.1 M. Ethanol denatured was then added to the 44 vol vol level. The suspension was allowed to stand for maximal settling of the cells and other insolubles about 48 hours . The clear supernatant was then transferred into another fractionation vat, with a recovery of 73 liters. Of this volume, 41 liters represent the aqueous phase.On this basis 29 liters of ethanol denatured were added to raise the ethanol level to 60 . Again, the suspension was allowed to stand for maximal settling of the precipitate which contains the desired polysaccharide. The clear supernatant was then pumped off and the precipitae collected by centrifugation Beckman, Model J 21C, in 500 ml cups, for 15 minutes at 6,000 RPM and at 200C . Step 2 Extraction of the Polysaccharide The rubbery pellets were suspended with the aid of a blender in 1800 ml of 1 sodium acetate with pH adjustment to 8 .5 using 2 N sodium hydroxide .The suspension was then cleared by centrifugation as in Step 1, except for 30 minutes at 8,000 RPM .There was a firm pellet, overlaid, however, by a creamy paste, which made it necessary to aspirate off the clear supernatant as decantating was not possible. The total volume was 1,240 ml extract.Step 3 Removal of Proteinaceous Materials with Trypsin The extract from Step 2 was charged with 30 mg trypsin and incubated at 37 C for 90 minutes. The pH was monitored for the range 8.2 8.6 during the incubation period. The digest was then immediately placed in an ice bath. Step 4 Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation of the Polysacchar ide While in an ice bath the digest was charged with ammonium sulfate 750 gm to 86 saturation.The resulting suspension was allowed to stand at 40C overnight to precipitate the polysaccharide. The clear supernatant was removed by aspiration and the salted out material was collected by centrifugation as described in Step 1.Step 5 Chromatography on DEAE Cellulose The ammonium sulfate precipitate from Step 4 was dissolved in 200 ml 1 sodium acetate and exhaustively dialyzed for 48 hours 42 x 12 hours against 10 liters distilled water, followed by 24 hours against 10 liters of 0.05 M borate buffer, pH 8.5 . A light turbidity in the retentate was cleared by centrifugation Sorvall, Model RC 5, in 50 ml cups, at 15,000 RPM for 20 minutes at 40C . The clear supernatant fluid was then applied to a column of DEAE Cellulose, eauilibrated with sodium borate 0.05 M, pH 8.5 , dimensions of 5.0 x 30 cm . The column was then washed with 700 ml borate buffer.Sodium chloride 0.3 M in borate buffer, 800 ml, was then applied to a column to mobilize the adhering polysaccharide. One hundred milliliter 100 ml fractions were collected and separately assayed serologically for their polysaccharide content.Active fractions 2 8 were pooled and the pool treated with 1.5 volumes of ethanol denatured to precipitate the polysaccharide which was recovered after removal of the clear supernatant and by centrifuqation as per Step 1 . Pellet volume was estimated as 10 cm3. Step 6 Recovery of the Polysaccharide as a Cetavlon Complex The precipitate from Step 5 was resuspended in 300 ml triply distilled water to give a clear solution. One hundred milliliters 100 ml of a 3 solution of Cetavlon in water was then added with stirring. The polysaccharide aggregated into a single lump allowing its easy removal.Step 7 Recovery of Product Intermediate 11059 101 The complex from Step 6 was solubilized in 200 ml 15 sodium acetate, at pH 8.0 at 40C. It took several hours to achieve complete solubilization.The solution was finally charged with two volumes of ethanol denatured to precipitate the polysaccharide as its sodium salt. The precipitate was collected, after removal of the clear supernatant, by centrifugation, as per Step 1. The pellet was triturated with about 100 ml ethanol denatured in a blender then collected on a small sintered glass funnel 15 ml, M , washed thereon with 50 ml ethanol and 50 ml acetone, followed by drying in a vacuum desiccator. The product intermediate was called 11059 101, yield 80 5 mg .Step 8 Molecular Sieving on Sepharose 6B and Final Product Recovery Two hundred milligrams 200 mg of 11059 101 were dissolved in 12 ml column buffer 1 sodium acetate and the solution applied to a column ofSepharose 6B 2.6 x 90 cm equilibrated with 1 sodium acetate. Fractions of 12.5 ml were collected and active fractions were identified by theOuchterlony double immunodiffusion method, using a type specific antiserum. Active fractions 14 29 were pooled. The operation was then repeated with a second 200 mg portion of 11059 101. The 2 pools were combined and concentrated in a Bio Rad No. 80 hollow fiber device to 100 ml. The concentrate was treated with 2 volumes of ethanol 200 proof to precipitate the polysaccharide. The precipitate was allowed to settle out and recovered, after removal of the supernatant and by centrifugation as per Step 1.The precipitate was then triturated with 50 ml ethanol 200 proof in a blender and was collected on a small sintered glass funnel 15 ml, M , washed thereon with 50 ml ethanol 200 proof and 50 ml acetone, followed by drying in a vacuum desiccator to constant weight.Final product 11059 113 yield 300 mg . EXAMPLE 13 RELEASE PROTOCOL FOR GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS TYPE Ib POLYSACCHARIDE, PRODUCT 11059 186Step 1 Preparation of Cell Free Fermentation Broth Type Ib broth, phenolized to 1 at termination of the fermentation cycle, was cleared of cells by centrifugation in a Sharples ultracentrifuge,Model T 1P.Step 2 Ultrafiltration Diafiltration of Cell Free Broth Sixty liters 60 liters of the cell free supernatant were pumped through an ultrafiltration hollow fiber device Amicon, Model DC 2 molecular weight cut off of fibers of 50,000 daltons to a final volume of 11.29 liters. Step 3 Isolation of First Crude Product The concentrate was charged with calcium chloride to 0.1 M and subsequently with ethanol denatured 2 BA, T type to 30 by volume. The resulting suspension was centrifuged in a Sharples centrifuge to obtain a clear supernatant 15.13 liters . The ethanol level was then raised to 61 by the addition of 12.06 liters of ethanol denatured .The resulting precipitate was obtained by allowing it to settle out, removing of most of the clear supernatant, and finally by centrifugation Beckman,Model J 21C, 50 ml cups, 15 minutes, 200C, 6,000 RPM Step 4 Isolation of Second Crude Product The first crude was suspended in 1,800 ml of 3 sodium acetate and full solubilization assured by stirring the suspension vigorously overnight at 40C.A serological probe performed on a small aliquot of the suspension indicated that the desired polysaccharide is fractionable with ethanol in the 40 60 range. The total volume of the suspension was 1,980 ml. The suspension was accordingly charged with 1,220 ml ethanol denatured to the 40 level and the alcoholic suspension cleared by centrifugation in theBeckman as described in Step 3. A considerable amount of insoluble materials were removed at 40 ethanol. The clear supernatant was then charged with additional 1,650 ml ethanol denatured to 60 , and the resulting suspension was allowed to stand for 48 hours to let the insolubles settle out. The insolubles second crude were then recovered by removal of most of the supernatant and by centrifugation as already described. Step 5 Isolation of the Polysaccharide as a Cetavlon Complex The wet pellets, ca. 40 cc in volume, were dissolved in 250 ml water to give a clear, but pigmented solution. The solution was then dialyzed for 24 hours to remove traces of sodium acetate. The retentate was then charged with 100 ml of a 5 solution of Cetavlon in water. The resulting suspension was let stand at 40C for 18 20 hours to allow the complexing to go to completion. A small aliquot of the suspension was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant checked for completion of comzplexing by adding more Cetavlon to the clear supernatant. There was no further precipitate. The Cetavlon polysaccharide complex was then collected by centrifugation in a Sorval centrifuge, Model RC 5, in 50 ril cups, for 10 minutes at 15,000 RPM and at 40C. The pellet was not entirely firm, but with a consistency of molasses allowed of the quick decantation of the clear supernatant.Step 6 Recovery of the Third Crude Product The Cetavlon complex was extracted with 200 ml of a 15 solution of sodium acetate at pH 8.0 and the cleared extract by centrifugation charged with 2 volumes of ethanol denatured . A gum formed which settled out overnight, allowing the total decantation of the alcoholic supernatant.Step 7 De Ionization of the Third Crude Product The third crude was taken up in 200 ml 0.05M borate buffer, pH 8.5 and ultrafiltered in anAmicon stirred cell 200 ml capacity, equipped with a 30,000 dalton cut off membrane . To remove traces of sodium acetate the volume was reduced to 50 ml then increased to 200 ml with borate buffer, followed by reduction to 50 ml.Step 8 DEAE Cellulose Fractionation of the Third Crude Product The retentate from Step 7 was applied to a column of DEAE cellulos 5.0 x 30 cm , equilibrated with 0.5 M borate buffer, pH 8.5. The column was washed with 700 ml borate buffer. The wash did not give a precipitate with 1.5 volumes ethanol, nor did it contain any trace of serologically active material in a test with type specific antiserum Ib by theOuchterlony double immunodiffusion method. The column was then washed with 0.25 M sodium chloride in borate buffer and 100 ml fractions collected.Fractions containing serologically active material No. 4 10 were pooled, and the polysaccharide was precipitated with 1.5 volumes of ethanol denatured .After the precipitate had settled out, most of the supernatant was removed by aspiration and the precipitate was finally collected hy centrifugation Sorvall, as described in Step 5 . This material was designated the Fourth Crude.Step 9 Trypsin Digestion of Fourth Crude Product to Obtain the Fifth Crude Product The precipitate from Step 8 was dissolved in 150 of a soluton of 3 sodium acetate and the pH adjusted down to 8 5. A blender was used to sped up the dispersion of the material. Trypsin was added 20 mg 238 units mg , and the system incubated for 90 minutes at 370C. The pH was monitored from time to time, but found unchanged throughout the incubation cycle. The digest was then charged with 1.5 volumes of ethanol denatured and the precipitate collected by centrifugation in a 500 ml cup Beckman centrifuge .The pellet was triturated in a small blender with absolute ethanol, collected on a small sintered glass funnel 15 ml, M , washed thereon with 50 ml absolute ethanol and 50 ml of acetone and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight. A white powder was obtained, product intermediate Fifth Crude 11059 185, with a yield of 741 mg.Step 10 Purificatin with Ammonium Sulfate Product intermediate 11059 185, as shown hySepharose 6B profiling, still carries a considerable amount of contaminant, masking in part the type polysaccharide. It was therefore decided to precipitate the desired polysaccharide with ammonium sulfate, at 86 saturation. The lot of the product intermediate was dissolved in 100 ml triply distilled water, and the solution was charged with enzyme grade ammonium sulfate 61 gm . The resulting suspension was let stand in the cold for 2 hours, and the precipitate was then recovered by centrifugation Sorvall, 15,000 RPM, 50 ml cups, for 15 minutes at 20C Step 11 Molecular Sieving of Ammonium Sulfate Precipitate The pellets from the previous step were dissolved in 12 ml eluant 1 sodium acetate, pH 7.5 .The clear solution, with a pale yellow pigmentation, was then applied to a column ofSepharose 6B, equilibrated with 1 sodium acetate, pH 7.5, dimensions of 2.6 x 90 cm . Fractions of 12.5 ml were collected, and their polysaccharide content monitored serologically by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion technique. Active fractions were pooled.Step 12 Recovery of Final Product, 11059 186 The pool 213 ml from Step 11 was diafiltered and concentrated to 20 ml in a suitableAmicon cell, equipped with a 30,000 M. W. cut off membrane. The concentrate was then charged with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol to precipitate the polysaccharide. This was separated by centrifugation, discarding the supernatant. The pellet was triturated in a small blender with absolute ethanol and the hardened particles collected on a sintered glass funnel. The polysaccharide was washed thereon with 50 ml absolute ethanol and 50 ml acetone and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 24 hours to constant weight. Final Product 11059 186 yield 189 mg . EXAMPLE 14 RELEASE PROTOCOL FOR GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS TYPE II POLYSACCHARIDE, PRODUCT 11059 176Step 1 Isolation of First Crude Product Eighty 80 liters of whole, phenolized broth were charged with 1,170 gm of calcium chloride, dihydrate, to 0.1 M. Ethanol denatured was then added to the 408 level vol vol . The suspension was allowed to stand for rttaximal settling of the cells and other insoluble materials about 48 hours . The clear supernatant was then pumped over into another fractionation vat, with a recovery of 94 liters. The aqueous phase in this system was calculated as 56.4 liters. On this basis, additional 47 liters of ethanol denatured were run in with stirring, to an ethanol level of 60 .Again, the suspension was allowed to stand for maximal settling of the precipitate which contains the desired polysaccharide. The clear supernatant was then aspirated off with the aid of a pump, and the precipitate collected by centrifugation Beckman,Model J 21C, in 500 ml cups, for 15 min. at 6,000 RPM and at 200C . Step 2 Isolation of Second Crude Product The crecìitate from Step 1 was resuspended in 1 sodium acetate 3,000 ml , giving a final volume of 3,340 ml and the suspension charged with calcium chloride to 0.1 M. Based on a serological probe it could be demonstrated that the desired polysaccharide can be fractionated with ethanol in the range of 38 59. Accordingly, the suspension was charged with 2,050 ml of ethanol denatured to the 38 level. The suspension was cleared by centrifugation, as per above, Step 1. Of the total supernatant recovered 4,850 ml 3,010 ml constitute the aqueous phase. The supernatant was then charged with ethanol denatured 2,470 ml to 59 . A floculent precipitate developed and settled out readily. It was allowed to settle out and the clear supernatant was removed by aspiration.The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation, as already described. Step 3 Removal of Proteinaceous Materials with Trypsin The slightly pigmented pellet from Step 2 was dissolved in 500 ml 0.05 M sodium borate, pH 8.5 and the solution was charged with 20 mg trypsin 4,760 unit . The system was incubated at 370C for 90 minutes.Step 4 Chromatography on DEAE Cellulose The trypsin digest from Step 3 was applied to a column of DEAE Cellulose DE 52, Whatman , equilibrated in 0.05 M sodium borate at pH 8.5, dimension 5 x 30 cm . The column was then washed with 700 ml borate buffer. The column was then treated with 800 ml of eluant, containing 0.3 M sodium chloride in borate buffer. Effluent fractions 100 ml were collected and separately assayed serologically for their polysaccharide content, and for precipitability with 1.5 volumes ethanol.
