# Heat shrinkable material and articles.

## Abstract
Heat shrinkable material obtained by a thermoreversible gelation of a solution of a linear poly ethylene having a weight average molecular weight of at least 4 10‚Åµ to form a gel material having virtually the same composition as the solution started from, and b irradiation of said gel material with simultaneous or subsequent stretching at a stretch ratio of at least 15. Specifically claimed are articles, such as fabrics woven from fibres, and tubes or tapes, having an extremely high shrink ratio upon heating.
