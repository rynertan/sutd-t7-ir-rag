# Projection lens system.

## Abstract
A lens system is provided which is suitable for back projecting an enlarged image of a TV cathode ray tube CRT . To achieve a compact cabinet design 1 for such a projection television set, a short projection throw and a wider projection angle are required, together with a wide aperture F 1 for a bright projected picture and with a definition sufficient to resolve 625 line television pictures. The lens system comprises a concave CRT face plate FP and only two lens elements L1, L2, each of positive power and each having one aspheric surface, the powers of the elements being chosen so that 0.4K K₁ 0.60K and 0.75K K₂ 1.05K where K₁ is the power of the element remote from the object surface, K₂ is the power of the element adjacent the object surface and K is the total power of the projection lens.
