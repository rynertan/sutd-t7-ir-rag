# FABRICATION OF DEVICES INCLUDING SELECTIVE FORMATION OF TITANIUM DISILICIDE BY DIRECT REACTION

## Abstract
Titanium 3 is deposited on a silicon substrate 1 and on a patterned layer of silicon dioxide 2 or polysilicon, and the structure is heated so that the titanium 3 in contact with silicon 1 or polysilicon reacts to form titanium disilicide 4 TiSi₂ , while the titanium in contact with silicon dioxide 2 does not interact. The TiSi₂ exhibits a much lower resistivity than silicon or polysilicon. This lower resistivity makes possible further advances in the performance of VLSI devices.
