# Pyrolytic boron nitride article and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A pyrolytic boron nitride article of the invention has uniform structure and has 0.5 or less nodules cmÂ² in average all through the overall surface of the article and 2 or less nodules in any portion of the unit square centimeter on the surface of the article. The pyrolytic boron nitride article is produced by depositing boron nitride through a vapor phase, using a boron halide gas and an ammonia gas as the starting materials. Upon production, the ammonia gas or a gas mixture containing the ammonia gas is not contacted directly with graphite at 300 to 1850 C.
