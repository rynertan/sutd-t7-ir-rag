# RELEASABLE CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A releasable connector for connecting a shackle bolt 22 on a liferaft to the depending end of a davit cable 20 is set in a safe condition for boarding and lowering of the liferaft. In the safe condition, a hook member 24 supports the shackle bolt 22 and is itself locked in its supporting position by a latch member 30 . A coupling spring 36 connected be tween the hook member 24 and the latch member 30 operates to one side of its dead center position to urge the latch member 30 into the locking position. A first downward pull on a lanyard 45 causes a pawl member 39 to engage a tooth 50 on the latch member 30 to move the latch member 30 from its locking position to a drive position in which the coupling spring 36 operates to the other side of its dead center position and urges the latch member 30 into its drive position. When the liferaft takes up a floating position on the water, the load on the shackle bolt 22 is relieved and automatic release of the shackle bolt 22 effected under the action of the coupling spring 36 which turns the hook member 24 out of its supporting position. If the automatic release fails, the lanyard 45 is given a second pull which bring the pawl member 39 , which has returned under spring loading, to engage a second tooth 51 on the latch member 30 and cause the latch member 30 to execute a driving movement in which it displaces the hook member 24 out of its supporting position for release of the shackle bolt 22 . A first pull on the lanyard 45 results only in the cocking of the connector for automatic release and cannot result in manual release. A second pull on the lanyard 45 is required to effect manual release.
