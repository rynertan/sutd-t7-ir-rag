# Recessed head screw.

## Abstract
A modified Phillips type cruciform recess in a screw or the like, which provides a cling fit with a driver by causing deflection of the flutes of the driver against the walls of the slot in the recess, comprises a central socket portion 14 and radially extending slots 16 adapted to receive the flutes of a suitable driving tool. Each slot is defined in part by a bottom surface of sub stantially uniform width which slopes radially inwardly and downwardly along the axis of the screw 10 . The bottom surface joins two opposing surfaces which form the walls of the slot 16 . The pairs of opposite slots 16a, 16b in the cruciform pattern are not symmetrically located relative to a plane including the longitudinal axis of the screw, but are offset laterally in opposite direc tions with respect to such a plane. On insertion of a standard driver into the recess, the flutes of the driver are caused to flex into frictional engagement with the walls of the slots, thereby achieving the desired cling fit.
