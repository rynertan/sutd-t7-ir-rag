# Pattern matching method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a pattern matching method and apparatus, wherein when an object pattern is coated with a master pat tern using pattern matching, an area corresponding to the master pattern size is sequentially extracted from a master sample image for forming the master pattern, each extracted pattern is collated to the other patterns in the image, and an ex tracted pattern, which has the minimum similarity to all the oth er patterns, and, as a result, shows the most distinctive pattern is used for a master pattern. Using the present method and ap paratus, the pattern matching having a higher recognition rate can be performed. Further, using the present pattern matching, an apparatus for positioning the object to be recognized with a higher accuracy can be obtained.
