## Description
Title PROCESS FOR PRODUCIDJG OXYGEN COMTAINING FrYDROCARBOiT COMPOW IDS This invention relates to a process for producing oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms by reacting a gaseous mixture composed of carbon oxide and hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. More specifically, this invention pertains to a process for advantageously producing oxygencontaining hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, particularly ethanol, from the aforesaid gaseous mixture using a catalyst composition comprising metallic rhodium and a certain metallic oxide as a hydrogenation catalyst. In recent years, there has been a worldwide scarcity of oil resources, and it is anticipated that a balance between supply and demand of oils will be aggravated in near future. Naphtha derived from crude oils has become increasingly costly in recent years, and the cost of production of low boiling olefins, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, ethanol, etc., which are the basic products of the petrochemical industry from naphtha, has tended to increase year by year. Accordingly, there has been an increasing need to develop a process for producing these basic raw materials of the petrochemical industry at low cost from a synthesis gas comprising a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Presently, the synthesis gas is produced industrially by steam reforming of naphtha and natural gases, but it is expected that in near future synthesis gases from low cost carbon resources occurring abunduntly throughout the world such as heavy oils, coals and oil sands will go into industrial production. The synthesis gas will therefore be an advantageous raw material both in cost and supply. Extensive investigations have been made heretofore about the production of hydrocarbons or both hydrocarbons and oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds from a gaseous mixture of carbon oxide carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide and hydrogen a synthesis gas process or a modified Fischer Tropsch method . It has been reported, for example, that various oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds and hydrocarbons can be synthesized by reacting a synthesis gas comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a ratio of from 4 1 to 1 4 in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a metal of the iron group or noble metal group at a temperature of 150 to 4500C and a pressure of 1 to about 700 atmospheres F. Fischer, H.Tropsch, Ber., 59,830, 832, 923 1926 , and H. Pichler, Adv. Catalysis, E, 271 1952 . The product obtained by this method is a mixture of oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds and hydrocarbons having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and this method cannot afford industrially useful oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having low carbon numbers selectively and efficiently. As a method for synthesizing oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds and lower olefins from a synthesis gas, the Hydrocol method comprising performing the reaction at 300 to 3500C and 20 to 50 atmospheres using a catalyst composed of iron or cobalt supported on magnesium oxide, thorium oxide, etc. see H. Pichler, Adv. Catalysis IV, 271 1952 , and the Synthol method involving performing the reaction at 300 to 4000C and 70 to 250 atmospheres F.Fischer, H. Tropsch, Brennstoff Chem., 4, 276 1923 , 5, 201, 217 1924 , 2, 97, 299 1926 , 8, 65 1927 have already been known. These methods, however, have poor selectivity.They are advantageous for production of higher olefins, but cannot selectively give olefins having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms which are useful as industrial materials. On the other hand, as regards the use of a rhodium catalyst, a method was suggested which comprises contacting a synthesis gas at atmospheric pressure with a rhodium supported catalyst containing a silica or alumina carrier or a rhodium metal plate to produce methane and not more than 100 of C2 C4 hydrocarbons see 31. A. Vannica,J. Catal., 37, 449 1975 , and B. Sexton, G.A Somorjai, ibid. 46, 167 1977 .Furthermore, about the selective production of oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having low carbon numbers by reaction of a synthetic gas using a rhodium supported catalyst, there were proposed a method which comprises reacting a synthetic gas at 290 to 325 0C and 35 to 350 atmospheres while maintaining theCO H2 ratio at much higher than 1 and the flow rate of the reactant gas at 10311 1 or higher as SV, to produce a mixture of oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having low carbon numbers, especially acetic acid, acetaldehyde and ethanol, in a carbon efficiency, based on the consumed carbon monoxide, of 50 Belgian Patent o. 824822, TD lio. 2503233 and Japanese Laid Open Patent PublicationNo. 80806 76 and a method which comprises reacting a synthesis gas at a flow rate of at least 107 1 under a pressure of 50 to 300 atmospheres using a silica carrier catalyst containing rhodium and iron to produce methanol and ethanol at substantially the same carbon efficiency as in the aforesaid method see Belgian Patent No. 824823, and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 80807 76 .These methods give methanol and ethanol in a substantially equimolar ratio, but cause formation of large amounts of methane or hydrocarbons having 2 or more carbon atoms as by products. At a low CO concentration in the synthesis gas CO H2 1.0 or less , a low pressure 1 to 50 atmospheres or a low flow rate not more than 102 h 1 as SV which are advantageous conditions for economical industrial proce sses by product hydrocarbons tend to increase further in these methods, and the selectivity for industrially useful oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms such as ethanol is drastically reduced. According to an improved method involving use of a catalyst comprising both rhodium and manganese seeJapanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 14706 77 , an increase in the conversion of CO per unit weight of rhodium is noted, but the addition of manganese can scarcely increase the selectivity for the formation of oxygencontaining hydrocarbon compounds. It has been pointed out that the addition of an excessive amount of manganese rather increases formation of hydrocarbons and reduces the selectivity for the formation of the desirable oxygencontaining hydrocarbon compounds. A method has also been known for producing a mixture of methanol and ethanol from a synthesis gas by reacting it at 1 to 50 atmospheres and 150 to 3000 C using a catalyst obtained by supporting a rhodium cluster or platinum cluster on an oxide of at least one metal selected from metals of Groups Ilab, IlIab and IVab of the periodic table of short form see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publications Nos. 41291 79 and 44605 79 . Although the catalyst used in this method is highly active, this method still has various difficulties which have to be overcome. For example, catalyst preparation requires the use of a special and expensive noble metal carbonyl cluster compound as a raw material, and includes operation in an inert atmosphere in vacuum or in an inert gas . The catalyst has a short lifetime under high temperature and high pressure conditions which are required for achieving a high conversion, and there is a limit to the operable temperature range for the catalyst. In view of the prior art techniques discussed above, it has been desired to develop a rhodium containing catalyst which is suitable for selective production of òxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, particularly ethanol, at a high carbon efficiency under relatively mild low pressure reaction conditions. The use of such a rhodium containing catalyst will provide a new technique which supersedes synthesis of methanol from a synthesis gas or production of ethylene from naphtha. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for producing oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms at a high carbon efficiency from a gaseous mixture of carbon oxide and hydrogen using a rhodium containing catalyst which is relatively inexpensive and is easily available. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, especially ethanol, from a gaseous mixture of carbon oxide and hydrogen. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. It has now been found in accordance with this invention that when a catalyst composition consisting basically of A substantially metallic rhodium and B an oxide of a metal to be referred to as a metal dioxide selected from metals of Groups IIa, IIIa, IVa and Va of the periodic table of short form is used in the production of oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds by reacting a gaseous mixture composed of carbon oxide and hydrogen, the carbon efficiency of the oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms is markedly improved, and reaches 50 Z, or more.It has also been found that the catalyst composition used in this invention generally has a wide operating temperature range, and exhibits superior catalytic activity at a wide temperature range of from about 100 to about 4000C, and its catalytic activity lasts for an extended period of time even under high temperature high pressure reaction conditions. According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for producing oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms which comprises reacting a gaseous mixture consisting of carbon oxide and hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, said hydrogenation catalyst being a catalyst composition comprising A substantially metallic rhodium, and 3 an oxide of a metal selected from metals ofGroups IIa, IIIa, IVa and Va of the periodic table of short form. In the present specification and the appended claims, the term oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms denotes hydrocarbons having 1 or 2 carbon atoms and an oxygen atom, such as methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid and acetic acid. The term carbon oxide inclusively represents both carbon monoxide CO and carbon dioxide C02 . In the present invention carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are used either singly or as a mixture. Preferably, the carbon oxide is carbon monoxide. The periodic table of short form , as used in the present application, denotes a periodic table of the type described at page 738 of Encyclopaedia Chimica ,Vol. 5 1951 Kyoritsu Shuppan K.K., Tokyo, Japan.According to this periodic table, Group IIa includes Be, trug, Ca, Sr, Ba and Ra Group IIIa, Sc, Y, lanthanide elements and actinide elements Group IVa, Ti, Zr and Hf and Group Va, V, Nb and Ta. The term carbon efficiency of oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds , as used in this application, denotes the percentage of the oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds in moles based on the consumed carbon oxide calculated for carbon on the carbon basis . The term selectivity for ethanol , as used in this application, denotes the percentage of ethanol based on the resulting oxygen containing hydrocarbon compbunds calculated for carbon, on the carbon basis . The metallic oxide used in the catalyst composition in accordance with this invention is an active catalytic ingredient having the ability to increase synergistically the catalytic activity of metallic rhodium which is a main catalytic ingredient. At the same time, the metal oxide serves as a carrier for metallic rhodium. The catalyst composition preferably consists essentially of metallic rhodium and the aforesaid metal oxide. Examples of the metal oxide include magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, beryllium oxide, lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide, neodymium oxide, yttrium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, thorium oxide, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide and tantalum oxide. Of these, lanthanum oxide, neodymium oxiee, cerium oxide, yttrium oxide, thorium oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, niobium oxide, and tantalum oxide are preferred. Thorium oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, niobium oxide and tantalum oxide are especially preferred. These metal oxides can be used either singly or in combination with each other. In order to support metallic rhodium, the metal oxide may generally be a solid in the form of powder, granule, pellet or lump having a surface area of generally at least 1 m2 g, preferably 10 to 1000 m2 g. Deposition of metallic rhodium on the metal oxide can be effected by any custom ay method so long as substantially all of the rhodium deposited on the metal oxide is metallic. Advantageously, this can be performed using a simple organic or inorganic salt of rhodium.The simple salt of rhodium , as referred to herein, means a compound simply containing mono or di nuclear rhodium element, and is clearly distinct from the cluster compound of rhodium mentioned hereinabove. Specific examples of the simple salt of rhodium include inorganic salts of rhodium such as the chloride, nitrite and carbonate of rhodium, and organic salts of rhodium such as the acetate, oxalate, ethylenediamine complex Rh NH2C2H4NH2 3 Cl3, pyridine complex Rh C4H4DJ 4C13 , acetylacetonato salt, cyclooctadiene complex, dicyclopentadienyl complex, w allyl complex, and allene complex of rhodium. Deposition of metallic rhodium on the metal oxide from these rhodium salts may be performed, for example, by a method which comprises dissolving the rhodium salt in a suitable solvent for example, water, an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or a hydrocarbon such as hexane or benzene , impregnating the metal oxide with the resulting solution, removing the solvent, and then heattreating the impregnated metal oxide in an atmosphere of a reducing gas such as hydrogen gas or synthesis gas under atmospheric ortelevared pressures until substantially all of the impregnated rhodium salt is converted to metallic rhodium for example, at a temperature of about 50 to about 5O00C for about 10 minutes to about 2 days this reducing treatment can be performed in a reactor prior to the performance of the process of this invention or chemically reducing the impregnated metal rhodium salt with a reducing agent such as formaldehyde, hydrazine, metal hydrides e.g., sodium hydride or potassium hydride , metal borohydrides e.g., sodium borohydride , or complex metal hydrides e.g., lithium aluminum hydride . As a result, there can be obtained a catalyst composition in accordance with this invention in which substantially metallic rhodium is supported and combined with the metal oxide. The content of metallic rhodium is not critical, and can be widely varied depending upon the type or shape of the metal oxide used, etc. Generally, it is advantageous that the content of metallic rhodium is about 0.0001 to about 5A, by weight, preferably about 0.01 to about 25 by weight, more preferably about 0.1 to about 1S by weight, based on the weight of the catalyst composition. The catalyst composition consisting essentially of metallic rhodium and the metal oxide so prepared can be directly used in the process of this invention. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that the joint use of the metallic rhodium and metal oxide with silica gives further increased catalytic activity, and a very high selectivity for ethanol. This discovery is surprising in view of the fact that the conjoint use of metallic rhodium and the metal oxide with alumina which is frequently used as a catalyst carrier results in reduced catalytic activity. Accordingly, an especially preferred catalyst composition in accordance with this invention consists essentially of metallic rhodium,the metal oxide and silica. This preferred catalyst composition may comprise silica as a substrate and deposited thereon, metallic rhodium and the metal oxide or an intimate composite of silica and the metal oxide, and metallic rhodium deposited on the composite. In the case of the former type, deposition of metallic rhodium and the metal oxide on silica can be performed by any method known per se. Deposition of metallic rhodium can be performed by the method described hereinabove. On the other hand, deposition of the metal oxide can be performed, for example, by dissolving an inorganic or organic metal compound of a metal of Groups Ila, IIIa, IVa and Va of the periodic table of short form in a suitable solvent for example, water, an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or a hydrocarbon such as hexane or benzene , impregnating the resulting solution in silica in various forms such as a powder, pellet 5 granule or lump, removing the solvent, and then heat treating the impregnated silica in an atmosphere of an oxygen containing gas e.g., air , an inert gas e.g., nitrogen, argon, helium, or carbon dioxide gas , or a reducing gas e.g., hydrogen or synthesis gas depending upon the type of the metal compound used until substantially all of the impregnated metal compound is converted to the corresponding metal oxide for example, heating it at a temperature of about 100 to about 600 C for about 30 minutes to about 2 days . As a result, the metal oxide can be deposited on silica. The inorganic or organic metal compound used in the deposition of the metal oxide includes the chlorides, oxynitrates, nitrates, carbonates, hydroxides, acetates, formates, oxalates, silyl ether salts, acetylacetonate salts, polyhydroxystearates, alkoxides dicyclopentadienyl complexes, 6 allyl complexes, benzyl complexes, and allene complexes of metals of Groups IIa, IIIa, IVa and Va of the periodic table of short form. Specific examples of these inorganic or organic metal compounds are magnesium chloride NgCl2 , magnesium bromide MgBr2 , magnesium nitrate Mg NO3 2 , magnesium hydroxyde Mg OH 2 , magnesium carbonate MgCO3 , magnesium formate Mg HCOO 2 , magnesium oxalate MgC2O4 2H2O , magnesium chlorate Mg ClO4 2 , magnesium methoxide Mg OCH3 2 , magnesium ethoxide Mg OC2H 2 , z z magnesium propoxide Mg OC3H7 2 , magnesium butoxide Mg OC4H9 2 , magnesium methylcarbonate Mg CH3OCOO 2 , calcium chloride CaCl2 , calcium bromide CaBr2 , calcium formate Ca HCOO 2 , calcium oxalate CaC2O4 2H2O , calcium hydroxide CCa OH 2 , calcium ethoxide Ca OC2H5 2 , calcium butoxide Ca OC4H9 2 , beryllium chloride BeCl2 , beryllium ethoxide Be OC2H5 2 , beryllium formate Be t COO 2 , lanthanum chloride LaCl3 3H2O , lanthanum nitrate La NO3 3 6H2O , lanthanum oxalate La2 C2O4 3 nH2O , lanthanum acetate La CH3CO2 2 4i2O , lanthanum acetylacetonate La C5H702 3.H20 , lanthanum carbonate La2 CO3 3 , neodymium chloride NdCl3 3H2O , neodymium bromide NdC13 , neodymium nitrate Nd NO3 3 3H2O , neodymium acetate Nd CG3COO 2 nH2O , neodymium acetylacetonate Nd C51T702 3 H20 , yttrium chloride YCl3 , yttrium chlorate Y ClO3 3 pH2O , yttrium perchlorate Y ClO4 3 9H2O , yttrium carbonate Y2 CO3 3 3H2O , yttrium ammonium carbonate NH4 Y CO3 3 H2O . yttrium formate Y HCOO 3 2H2O , yttrium tartrate Y2 C4H4O5 3 nH2O , yttrium acetylacetonate Y C5H702 3eH20 , cerium chloride CeC13e7H20 , cerium nitrate Ce N03 3 6H20 , cerium acetate Ce CH3CO2 3 H2O , cerium acetylacetonate Ce C5H7O2 3 , cerous ammonium nitrate Ce NO3 2 2 NH4NO3 4H2O , ceric ammonium nitrate Ce NO3 4 2 NH4NO3 nH2O , cerium carbonate Ce2 CO3 38H2O , cerium oxalate Ce2 C2O4 39H2O , zirconium oxynitrate ZrO NO3 2 2H2O , zirconum nitrate Zr NO3 3 6H2O , titanium nitrate Ti N03 3N6H20 , zirconium oxyacetate ZrO CH3COO 3 , titanium oxyacetate TiO CH3COO 3 , zirconium oxychloride ZrOC12 , titanium oxychloride TiOC12 , zirconium tetra chloride ZrCl4 , , titanium tetrachloride TiC14 , zirconium acetate Zr CH3COO 2 , titanium acetate Ti CH3COO 2 , zirconium ethoxide Zr OC2H5 4 , titanium ethoxide Ti OC2H5 4 , zirconium isopropoxide Zr O isoC3H7 4 , titanium isopropoxide Ti O isoC3H7 4 , z , zirconium n propoxide Zr On C3H7 4 , titanium n propoxide Ti On C3H7 4 , zirconium butoxide Zr OC4H9 4 , titanium butoxide Ti OC4H9 4 , dicyclopentadienyl zirconium chloride C5H5 2ZrC12 , dicyclopentadienyl titanium chloride C5H5 TiCl2 , dicarbonyldicyclopentadienyl zirconium D C5H5 2Zr CO 2 , dicarbonyldicyclopentadienyl titanium g C5H5 2Ti CO 2 , zirconium acetylacetonate Zr C5H7O2 4 , titanium acetylacetonate Ti C5H7O2 4 , thorium nitrate Th NO3 4 5H2O, thorium acetylacetonate Th C5H702 4 , thorium chloride ThC14 , thorium acetate Th CH3COO 2 , thorium isopropoxide Th iso C3H7O 4 , thorium n propoxide Th n C3H70 , thorium butoxidd Th C4H90 4 , vanadyl ethoxide VO O C2H5 3 , vanadyl butoxide VO OC4H9 3 , vanadyl methoxide VO OCH3 3 , vanadyl ethoxychloride VO OC2H5 2C1 , vanadyl acetylacetone VO C5H702 3 , niobium propoxide Nb OC3H7 5 , niobium ethoxide Nb OC2H5 5 , niobium butoxide Nb OC4H9 5 , niobium acetylacetonate Nb C5H7O2 3 , vanadocene C5H5 2V , niobucene Nb C5H5 2X2 X C1, CO, H , tantalum ethoxide Ta OC2H5 5 , tantalum butoxide Ta O C4H9 5 , tantalum acetylacetonate Ta C5H702 3 niobium chloride NbCl5 , tantalum chloride TaC15 , 1S allyl vanadium carbonyl complex C3H5 2 V CO 2 , allyl tantalum carbonyl complex t C3H5 2 Ta CO 2 and benzyl zirconium complex Zr CHzC6H5 4 . These metal compounds are generally converted to metal oxides by heat treatment and or photo decomposition in an atmosphere containing an oxygen containing gas, an inert gas or a reducing gas. In what condition the metal oxide is deposited on and combined with silica is not clear. It is assumed however that because of a chemical reaction between the metal compound used as a raw material and the hydroxyl group on the surface of silica, at least a part of the deposited metal oxide is in the form of a fixed oxide in which the metal in the metal compound is chemically bonded to a silicon atom through oxygen. It should be understood therefore that the metal oxide1, as used in this invention, also embraces such a fixed oxide. Deposition of metallic rhodium and deposition of the metal oxide can be performed in various sequences depending upon the depositing conditions. For example, when the deposition of the metal oxide is carried out in an atmosphere containing an oxygen containing gas or an inert gas, it is generally preferred to perform the deposition of the metal oxide first. Thtlhen the deposition of the metal oxide is carried out in an atmosphere of a reducing gas, the deposition of metallic rhodium and the deposition of the metal oxide can be performed simultaneously or sequentially in an optional order. The silica on which to deposit metallic rhodium and the metal oxide may have a surface area of generally at least 10 m2 g, preferably 10 to 1000 m2 g, more preferably 50 to 500 m2 g. It may assume various ordinary forms as a catalyst substrate, such as a powder, granule, pellet, or lump. The preferred catalyst composition may also be in such a form that metallic rhodium is deposited on a composite of silica and the metal oxide. The composite of silica and the metal oxide can be usually produced by preparing an aqueous solution of a water soluble silicon compound and a water soluble metal compound of the type exemplified hereinabove, co precipitating silicon and the metal in the form of hydroxide from the aqueous solution in a customary manner, separating the co precipitate, optionally molding it into such a shape as granule or pellet, and then firing it. Deposition of metallic rhodium on the resulting silica metal composite can be performed by the method described hereinabove. The resulting catalyst composition comprising metallic rhodium, the metal oxide and silica may contain metallic rhodium in a proportion of generally about 0.0001 to about 5z o by weight, preferably about 0.01 to about 25sag by weight, more preferably about C.1 to about 1 by weight, based on the weight of the catalyst composition. The weight ratio of metallic rhodium to the metal oxide is generally from 1 100 to 100 1, preferably from 1 50 to 50 1, more preferably from 1 10 to 10 1, and the weight ratio of the metal oxide to silica is generally from 1000 1 to 1 1000, preferably from 100 1 to 1 100, more preferably from 10 1 to 1 10.The content of silica may be about 0.001 to about 99 by weight, preferably about 0.1 to about 98sic by weight, more preferably about 1 to about 9zXo by weight, based on the weight of the catalyst composition. It has further been found in accordance with this invention that the carbon efficiency of the oxygencontaining hydrocarbon compound having 1 or 2 carbon atom and the selectivity for ethanol can be further improved by incorporating an element selected from niobium, tantalum, chromium, manganese and rhenium as a sub main catalyst ingredient into a catalyst composition consisting of metallic rhodium, an oxide of a metal selected from metals of Groups IIla, IVa and Va of the periodic table of short form, and optionally silica and using the resulting catalyst composition in the reaction of a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon oxide. Thus, according to another aspect of this invention, there is also provided a process for producing oxygen containir,g hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms which comprises reacting a gaseous mixture composed of carbon oxide and hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, said hydrogenation catalyst being a catalyst composition comprising i substantially metallic rhodium, ii an element selected from the group consisting of niobium tantalum, chromium, manganese and rhenium, and iii an oxide of a metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups Illa, IVa and Va of the periodic table of short form, and iv optionally, silica. The catalyst composition used in this process can be prepared in the same way as in the aforesaid catalyst composition except that the metal element selected from niobium, tantalum, chromium, manganese and rhenium is additionally deposited on the metal oxide, or silica, or the silica metal oxide composite. Deposition of such additional metal element on the metal oxide, silica or the silica metal oxide composite can be performed in the same way as in the deposition of metallic rhodium. For example, it can be performed by dissolving an inorganic or organic salt or alkoxide of the metal element in a suitable solvent for example, water, an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or a hydrocarbon such as hexane or benzene , impregnating the resulting solution in the metal oxide, silica or the silica metal oxide composite, removing the solvent, and reducing the impregnated metal salt until substantially all of it is reduced to metallic element as in the case of metallic rhodium. The inorganic or organic salt or alkoxide of the additional metal element that can be used includes, the chlorides, nitrates, carbonates, acetates, oxalates, acetylacetonate salts, dicyclopentadienyl complexes, r allyl complexes, allene complexes and alkoxides of the metals.Specific examples include rhenium chloride ReCl5 , rhenium bromide ReBr5 , rhenium carbonyl Re2 CO 10 , dicyclopentadienyl rhenium hydride C2H5 2 ReH3 , carbonyl dicyclopentadienyl rhenium C5H5 2 Re CO 2 , rhenium nitrate Re NO3 5 6H2O , rhenium acetate Re CH3COO 5 , ammonium rhenate NH4 2Re2O4 , niobium chloride NbCl5 , niobium bromide ThBr5 , dicyclopentadienyl niobium hydride C5H5 2NbH3 , allyl niobium C3H5 4Nb , tantalum chloride TaCl5 , tantalum bromide TaBr5,dicyclopentadienyl tantalum hydride L C5H5 2TaH3 , t allyl tantalum C3H5 4Ta , niobium acetylacetonate Nb C5H7O2 5 , tantalum acetylacetonateCTa C5H7O2 5 , manganese chloride MnCl2 4H2O , manganese acetylacetonate Mn C5H7O2 2 , manganese acetate Mn CH3 COO 2 4H2O , manganese nitrate Mn NO3 2 6H2O , dicyclo pentadienyl manganese C5H5 2Mn , chromium chloride CrCl3, or CrC13 6H20 , chromium nitrate Cr N03 3 9H20 , chromium acetylacetonate Cr C5H702 3 , dicyclopentadienyl chronium Cr C5H5 2 , and allyl chronium C3H5 3Cr . These metal compounds can be used either singly or in combination with each other. Deposition of such a metal element can be performed either before, during or after the deposition of metallic rhodium. The amount of the metal element to be deposited is not critical, and can be varied widely depending upon the type of the metal element,etc. Generally, it is such that the weight ratio of metallic rhodium to the metal element is from 50 1 to 1 50 preferably from 20 1 to 1 20 more preferably from 1 10 to 10 1. The total amount of metallic rhodium and the metal element may be about 0.001 to about 50 by weight, preferably about 0.01 to about 25 by weight, more preferably about 0.1 to about 25V. by weight, based on the weight of the catalyst composition. The reaction of a gaseous mixture of carbon oxide and hydrogen in the presence of the catalyst composition of the various embodiments described hereinabove can be performed in a manner known Per se. For example, the reaction can be performed by feeding the catalyst composition into a suitable catalytic reactor such as a closed circulating reactor, a fixed bed type reactor adapted for flowing of a starting gaseous mixture at atmospheric or elevated pressure a batchwise pressure reactor or a batchwise shaking pressure reactor, and contacting the starting gaseous mixture with the catalyst composition at about 50 to about 450 C and a space velocity of about 10 to about 106 liters liter.hr 1, preferably about 10ê to about 105 liters liter.hr 1, at a temperature of about 100 to about 350 C, and a pressure of about 0.5 to about 350 atmospheres G , preferably about 1 to about 300 atmospheres G . The mole ratio of carbon oxide to hydrogen in the starting gaseous mixture to be fed into the reactor is generally from 20 1 to 1 20, preferably from 1 5 to 5 1, more preferably from 1 2 to 2 1. Thus, according to the process of this invention, oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds having 1 or 2 carbon atoms can be produced with a high carbon efficiency from a gaseous mixture of carbon oxide and hydrogen by using the aforesaid catalyst composition which is easily available commercially and hae excellent catalytic activity and selectivity. The process of this invention gives oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds containing methanol and or ethanol as main ingredients. The mixture of methanol and ethanol formed as main ingredients can be easily separated into the constituents by distillation.Hence, the process of this invention is commercially feasible for production of methanol and ethanol. Moreover, blending of the oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds containing methanol and ethanol as main ingredients with a fuel gas gives fuels which may supersede the present fuels from natural resources and are expected to contribute to saving of petroleum resources. One great advantage of the process of this invention is that ethanol can be produced at a high selectivity when the aforesaid catalyst composition or the aforesaid silica containing catalyst composition further includes a metal element selected from niobium, tantalum, chromium, manganese and rhenium in addition to metallic rhodium. Ethanol can be easily separated from the oxygencontaining hydrocarbon compounds containing a major proportion of ethanol which are obtained by the process of this invention. Hence, the process of this invention is commercially feasible for production of ethanol from a synthesis gas. Moreover, blending off the oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds containing ethanol as a main ingre dient with a fuel gas or gasoline gives fuels which may supersede the present fuels from natural resources and are expected to contribute to saving of petroleum resources.

The impregnated magnesium oxide was evaporated to dryness by a rotary evaporator to afford a yellow powder. The resulting yellow powder was packed into a closed circulating type reactor total capacity 400 ml , heat treated under vacuum at 2000C, and then subjected to reducing treatment in a stream of hydrogen at 350or for 15 hours.After reduction, a gaseous mixture consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen introduced into the reactor and the reaction was started under the conditions shown in Table 1 this reaction will be referred to hereinbelow as a CO H2 reaction . When the activity of the catalyst became steady, the distribution of products of the CO H2 reaction was examined. The results are shown in Table 1.Examples 2 to 10 By the same operation as in Example 1, rhodium was deposited on 20g of titanium oxide powder a product of Merck RG , zirconium oxide powder a product ofNakarai Chemical Co., Ltd. RG , lanthanum oxide powder a product of Kishida Cheic Cheic Chemical Co., Ltd. RG , neodymium oxide powder a product of Wako PureChemical Co., Ltd.

Rg , thorium oxide powder a product of Tokyo ChemicalCo., Ltd. RG , niobium oxide powder a product of WakoPure Chemical Co., Ltd RG , and tantalum oxide powder, respectively, using an aqueous solution of 0.50 g of rhodium chloride trihydrate in 100 cc of distilled water.Using the resulting catalysts, the CO H2 reaction was performed in the same way as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 1. The products in vapor phase were analyzed by gas chromatography using a thermal conducting detector TCD and an active carbon column 1 m, room temperature, and an A1203 dimethylformamide supported in an amount of 58,b by weight column 4 m, room temperature . The oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds trapped by a dry ice acetone trap of the reactor were analyzed by TCD gas chromatography on a Porapak O trademark column 4 m, 2000C and a PEG 1500 column 2m, 800C . Comparative Example 1 In the same way as in the preceding Examples, rhodium was deposited on 20 g of silica WAKOW GEL, 200 mê g, C 200 and alumina Nishio Kogyo K. K., 280 mê g, A 1 , and using the resulting catalyst, theCO H2 reaction was performed in the same way as in the preceding Examples. The results are shown in Table 1.

Rhodium chloride trihydrate 1.2 g was dissolved in 100 ml of methanol to form a crimson solution. The zirconium oxide supported silica pellets were added to the solution, and after dipping, the methanol was evaporated off by a rotary evaporator to obtain a rhodium chloride supported product.Ten gram of the rhodium chloride supported product was packed into a flowing type reactor of Pyrex glass 18 mm in diameter x 500 mm in length . Glass beads were placed on the top and bottom of the catalyst layer. zslhile passing a hydrogen gas 1 atmosphere , the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature. Then, the CO H2 reaction was performed at a total pressure of 1 atmosphere by passing a gaseous mixture of CO and H2 diluted with Re CO H2 He 20 40 20 ml min. through the catalyst layer.At about 150 to 2500C, the amounts of oxygen containing hydrogen compounds and hydrocarbons formed were measured. The resulting oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds consisted of ethanol as a main ingredient, methanol, acetaldehyde, acetic esters, and traces of propanol and butanol. Every one hour, the off gas was bubbled through 50 ml of distilled water condenser , and the resulting oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds were absorbed and trapped. The products were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by an FID gas chromatographic analyzer Shimazu 74 using a Porapak Q column 4 m, 2000C, gas carrier . For calibration, acetone was used as an internal standard. Methane, CO2 and CO were analyzed by an active carbon column 1 m, room temperature .C2 C4 hydrocarbons were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by a TCD gas chromatographic analyzer Shimazu 4B using an alumina diethylformamide supported in an amount of 38eye by weight column. As a result of the overall analysis of the products shown in Table 8, the performance of the present catalyst in the CO I2 reaction at atmospheric pressure was shown by the conversion of CO, the carbon efficiency or selectivity of oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds based on the converted CO and the selectivity for ethanol in the oxygen containing hydrocarbon compoundsExample 26 Rhodium chloride was deposited from its methanol solution on 10 g of silica gel Davison W 57 , and the supported product was subjected to reducing treatment in a hydrogen stream H2e 4040, ml min. at 1 atmosphere. solution of 25 g of zirconium oxynitrate dihydrate in 100 ml of methanol was added to the resulting rhodiumsilica catalyst. The impregnated catalyst was evaporated in a rotary evaporator to remove the solvent. The resulting catalyst was again packed into a flowing type reactor, and subjected to reducing treatment in a stream of hydrogen at 4000C and 1 atmosphere. Using the resulting rhodium zirconia silica catalyst the CO H2 reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in the same way as in Example 22. The results are shown in Table 8.Example 27 A mixture of 1.2 g of rhodium chloride trihydrate and 2.5 g of zirconium oxynitrate dihydrate was dissolved in 100 ml of methanol, and 10 g of silica gel Davison t57 was added to the solution. The impregnated silica gel was dried in a rotary evaporator to remove the methanol. The product was subjected to reducing treatment in hydrogen in the same way as in Example 25 to prepare a rhodium zirconia silica catalyst. Using 10 g of the resulting catalyst, the CO H2 reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure. The results are shown in Table 8.Comparative Example 5 For comparison, a rhodium silica catalyst was prepared by the same operation as in Example 25 except that 1.2 g of rhodium chloride trihydrate was deposited on 10 g of silica gel Davison num 57 from its methanol solution. Using 10 g of the resulting catalyst, the COH2 reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure in the same way as in Example 25. The results are shown inTable 8. It is seen from the results given in Table 8 that the silica supported rhodium catalyst containing zirconium oxide gives a much higher CO conversion and a much higher selectivity for oxygen containing hydrocarbon compounds, especially ethanol, than does the silicasupported rhodium catalyst not containing zirconium oxide.
