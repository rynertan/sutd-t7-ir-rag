## Description
UREA ASSAY AND PROCESS FOR DETERMINATI0N OF UREA FIELD OF HE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the ficld of diagnostic compositions, and more particularly, to diagnostic tests useful in the qualitative and quantitative determination of urea in body fluids, especially blood. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Urea is the major end product of protein metabolism in man and in other mammals. This product is formed in the liver, passes into the blood and is excreted through the kidney into the urine, where it constitutes the major fraction of the organic substances. Elevations of blood urea, referred to as azotemia, almost invariably indicate impairment of renal function. The test for determination of blood urea usually expressed as urea nitrogen in theUnited States is one of the most performed in routine clinical chemistry. Urea concentration in urine is also sometimes measured for determining the urea clearance, which is a measure of the glomerular filtration rate. Methods used in routine clinical chemistry for determining urea in biological fluids can be classified as direct condensation of urea with suitable reagents able to form a measurable chromogen and indirect determination of ammonia as a product of urease action on urea . Among direct methods, the one with diacetylmonoximc, described in R. J. lienry, et aZ Clinical Chemistry I r inciples and Technics, ll arper 4 Row 2nd Edition 1974 , has been widely applied in routine clinical chemistry, both with manual and automated procedures.This method suffers many disadvantages, such as 1 . relative non specificity, since it gives positive reactions with citrulline, allantoin, and other body fluids components 2 . a standard curve or at least a two point calibration must be prepared every day 3 . the color fades rapidly and is photosensitive 4 . the reaction has to be carried out at a relatively high temperature and 5 . the ump leasant odor and irritant fumes of the reagents make it advisable to work ina fume hood. For these reasons, the enzymatic indirect methods .lre generally preferred to the diacetylmonoxime method. Indirect methods are based on enzymatic conversion of urea to ammonia by urease urea amidohydrolase according to the reaction EMI3.1 and subsequent determination of the liberated ammonia with suitable reagent systems R. Richterich, Clinical ChemistryTheor y and Practice , translated from the 2nd German Edition,S. Karger, Basel 1969 and H.U. Bergmeyer, Methods ofEnzymatic Analysis , 2nd English Edition, Vol. 4, VerlagChemie Academic Press, New York 1974 . The chief characteristic of enzymatic methods is the specificity since only urea is hydrolyzed by urease. Among the methods for determination of the enzymati cally liberated ammonia, which is proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample, the one that has achieved the largest popularity in laboratory practice is based on the Berthelot reaction in which ammonia 2 ions react in alkaline medium with phenol and hypochlorite to give the blue dye indophenol.The determination of urea according to this method requires two steps in the first step the sample is incubated at 370C usually from 10 to 20 minutes with urease at the pH most suitable for the enzymatic rcactio i.e. around 6.5 in the second step alkaline solutions of phenol and hypochlorite are added and incubation carried out for developing color, usually at 370 , from 10 to 30 min utes. Another two step method is described by Bergmeyer, supra, which allows determination of ammonium ions derivcd from the enzymatic reaction with urease by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase GlDH according to the reaction 2 oxoglutarate NADH NH4 GlDH L glutamate NAD H2O and measurement of the decrease in the NADH absorbance at 340 or 334, or 366 nanometers nm . Various changes have been made in this method in order to perform it in only onc step, with only one reagent preparation and making use of the kinetic type of analysis. In spite of the improvements this method remains of limited use in routine clinical chemistry owing to the high cost of the reagents and lack oL applicability to automated continous flow analyzers.

Other objects of th e invention will be evident from the following description and claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Present laboratory methods for assaying urea nitrogen in biological fluids suffer many disadvantages, already outlined. In contrast, the method according to the present invention is the only one that joins together the followillg advantageous characteristics applicability to automated analyzers, including continous flow analyzers particularly with the enzyme urease in immobilized form acceptable cost of reagents determination in only one step kinetic anaiyis both as a one point and as a two point or multi poillt determination low number of reagent preparations and specificity. The presence of all these characteristics contomporan eously in this method make it remarkably valuable in l.al ora tory practice, both with manual method and with automated or semi automated instruments. In accordance with the present invention there are provided test means, such as a com ositioll, CL test device, a test kit, a method of making a test device and a process For detection of urea. More particularly, suitable test means are of the type which comprises urease and a reagent cor position comprising acetylacetone and a C1 C4 alkyl aldchyde or the reaction product 3,5 diacetyl 2,6 heptanedione C F the acetylacetone and formaldehyde. The composition can be incorporated with a carrier, such as a matrix or tablet, to provide a test device. The composition can also be combined in a test kit for determining urea which kit comprises, in packaged combination, a container of urease, a container of a reagent composition according to the invention and, optionally, a container of buffer. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMYODIMEN r Although specific terms are used for clarity, these terms refer only to the particular embodiment selected for illustration, and are not intended to limit the scol e of tlie invention. In one embodiment, test means for tile determination of urea in a sample comprise urease and an indicator reagent composition comprising acetylacetone and a C1 C4 alkyl aldehyde. The alkyl aldehyde can preferably be formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. In another embodiment the reaction product resulting from reacting acetylacetone and formaldehyde, which reaction product is 3,5 diacetyl 2,6 heptanedione, can likewise be used as the indicator reagent composition lol the determination. rhe synthesis of 3,5 liacetyL 2,6 heptanedione from acetylacetone and formaldehyde was destrlUed in B.D. Wilson, et al., Belgian Pat. t18,140 and B.. Wilson, J. Org. Chem., 28, 314 320 196j , however this compound was not synthetized for analytical purposes. The composition can be used in solution or in a varicty of conventional dry formats. Whether as a solution or in a dry format, the composition according to the invention is used to detect urea by contacting it with a body fluid specimen such as urine, blood, plasma, or serum. When urea is present in the specimen to be tested a color change is effected thereby. Since a characteristic color reaction takes place depending on the concentration of the urrea to be detected, quantitative determination of the urea is possible. Also provided is a test device incorporating t ie com position of the invention and a single dip method of making such a reagent test device which comprises contacting a carrier, such as a tablet or matrix, with a solution of the composition according to the invention. When this contact is by impregnation with a solution of the composition according to the invention the carrier so contacted is then dried.The solvents used in preparing impregnation solution can include water, physiological solutions, organic solvents or mixtures thereof. The test device is advantageously used by momentarily dipping it in a test sample, or by otherwise introducing a test sample into the carrier, whereby a detectable color change results when urea is present. the test device may be used in the same way when samples of plasma, seruni, or other body fluids are tested. Tiie test device of the invention may be mounted on an elongated support memIr, if desired. The term carrier refers to matrices which are insoluble in and maintain there structural integrity when exposed to physiological or other liquid. Suitable matrices which may be used include paper, cellulose, wood fabrics, gelatin, various organic polymer, such as polypropylene, and other organic materials well known as film formers to those skilled in the art. For convenience, the matrix can he associated with an insoluble support member such as can be made of polystyrene. The term carrier also refers to conventional tableting materials which can be pressed or molded into a convenient physical form. Further in accordance with the invention there is provided a test kit for determining urea in a sample which comprises, in packaged combination, a container of urease, a container of an indicator reagent composition comprising acetylacetone and C1 C4 alkyl aldehyde and, optionally, ct container of buffer. Preferably the alkyl aldehyde is formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. In another embodiment the test kit for determination of urca comprises , in packaged combination, a container of urease, a container of 3,5 diacetyl 2,6 heptanedione and, optionally, a container of buffer.In either of these embodiments the test kit can further comprises a container of urea standard for coin parison with the sample upon reaction with the composition or test device. Additionally, the test kit can be such that at least one of the containers is a cuvette, preferably one which is optically clear and can be used for spectrophoto metric reading of the reaction resultant from contacting the composition with a sample. For solutions containing the composition of the invention certain ranges are preferred. When the assay is performed with the composition in solution, the concentra tion ranges in the final aqueous solution of the ass are as follows. Urease can be used in concentrations givig n activity of from about 5 to about 60 U ml LU is the unit of enzyme activity defined as the amount of activity that transforms 1 umol of urea per minute at 25 C and pH 8.0, according to the assay method of Schlegel and Kaltwasser inH.U. Bergmeyer, Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, 2ntl HanglischEdition, vol. 2, Verlag Chemie Academic Press, New York 1974 depending on the sample volume reagent volume rat io when this ratio is low about 1 125 , the preferred urease concentration is from 18 to 30 U ml when this ratio i s h igli about 1 20 , the preferred urease comcentration is from SU to 50 U ml. The indicator reagent can be acetylacetone and a C alkyl aldehyde or, likewise, it can be 3,5 diacetyl 2,6 heptanedione DHD in both cases the concentratioti is preferably as high as possible within the limits of solo bility if acetylacetone and a C1 C4 alkyl aldehyde are usUd as indicator reagent, the ratio between acetylacetone and the aldehyde is preferably stoichiometric 2 mol acetylacetone l mol aldehyde . A buffer substance can be mcluded with the test means. The buffer substance can be used in concentrations of from about 0.01 to about 1.0 mol l mol liter , preferably from 0.15 to 0.25 mol l, and is are ferably made with phosphate salts.Disodium edetate, in concentrations of from about 0.002 to about 0,008 mol 1, is preferably added. The pH of the solution can be from about 5.0 to about 9.0, preferably from 6.5 to 7.S. The assay can be also performed with the composition ol the invention in dry format. When the carrier is contacted with the composition by impregnating it with a solution of the composition, the concentration ranges iii the aqueous solution for the impregnation are as follows. Teh activity U ml of urease is preferably as high as possible riflljll the limits of solubility. The indicator reagent, the buffer substance and disodium cdctate are used with the sauce con centration ranges described for the assay performed with the composition in solution. A low boiling solvent soluble in water, like methanol, is preferably added in concontrations of from about 20 to about 30 ml dl. The manner of performing the detcrmillatioll of urea with the composition of the invention ill solution can vary depending on whether the determination is manual or auto mated and which type of instrumentation is available. The basic distinction is between A equilibrium methods of analysis and B kinetic methods of analysis. In the equilibrium method the reaction is carried out at about 370C and after a suitable time the absorbance or the solution is read with a spectrophotometer at the suitable wavelength. Since the time for the reaction to reach the equilibrium end point is very long, the assay is preferably performed in concentrated solution, in order to have a sufficient reaction rate and the reading is done at a point of quasi equilibrium. When the reaction approaches the end and the rate is sufficiently low, the solution is diluted at room temperature with the amount of water ncces sary for the absorbance to be into the instrument scale and for the reaction rate to stop completely.Then, the absor bance of the solution is read at room temperature against a reagent blank. The calculation is done in the usual wy by means of a standard. In the one point kinetic method the reaction is carried out at about 37 C and after a predetermined fixed tinkle before equilibrium the absorbance of tlic solution is read with a spectrophotometer at the same temperature at the suitable wavelength against a reagent blank. If the tic at which the absorbance is read is perfectly reproducible, is in automatic analyzers, the absorbance is linear with the analyte concentration. This linearity is valid at ally time during the reaction therefore, the reading can be done at any time, according to the required sensitivity. The calculation is done by means of a standard.With this mothoc it is convenient, particularly if serum or plasma is used js sample, to use a sample volume reagent volume ratio not too high, in order to avoid intereferences from the smaple.Therefore, a long reading time can be necessary to eicIi the required sensitivity. In this case it is convenient to tie automatic analyzers that read the absorbance of the samples one after the other without waiting for the incubation tile between sample and sample for example, continous flow analyzers . In the two point or multi point method the reaction is carried out preferably at about 37 C and the absorbance change of the solution over a predetermined fixed tjlne interval before the equilibrium is measured with a spectro photometer at the same temperature at the suitable wavelength against a reagent blank. If the tinie interval over which the absorbance change is measured is perfectly repro ducible, as in automatic analyzers, the absorbance change is linear with the analyte concentration.This linearity is valid over any time interval during the reaction therefore the measurement can be done over any tire interval, jc cording to the required sensitivity. The calculation is done by means of a standard. With this method interferences from substances present in the sample, absorbing at the reading wavelength, are eliminated even if a high sample volume reagent volume ratio its used. Therefore the required sensitivity can be reached with very low measurement times, and any type of automatic analyzers functioning with the two point or multi point method can be used. In the above described methods of analysis, the absorbance of a solution is measured and this accords with an assay performed with the composition of the invention in solution. When the assay is performed with this composition in dry format and the color develops on an opaque surface, the above described methods can still be used, provided that a suitable instrument measures the reflectance of this surface instead of the absorbance of the solution. Altcrnatively a qualitative or a semi quantitative reading caii he performed visually, preferably with the aid of a suitable color scale. The following examples illustrate preferred eml odimcnts of the invention. Example 1Assay of Urea Nitrogen in Body Fluids with 5,S Diacctyi 2,6 Heptanedione DHD The DHD used in the assay was first synthetized as follows 136 ml acetylacetone and 52 ml formaldehyde 35 both analytical grade reagents were dissolved ill distilled water, made up to 1.0 liter and left stand at room temperature for 6 days yield of DHD about 92 . The contents of DHD was determined by UV analysis with the aid of a standard solution of DHD . The little amount of unreacted formaldehyde was removed by a slight vacuum. The resulting solution proved suitable for the use as all a ily tical reagent without further purification. Reagent preparations used in the urea assay were as follows Reagent 1 Buffer KH2PO4 K2HPO4 0.28 M in distilled water, pH 7, containing 0.2 g dl disodiuni edetate dihydrate analytical grade reagents Reagent 2 Urease, freeze dried powder, 50 U mg from Miles Laboratories, Inc., code 36 615 Reagent 3 The DHD solution above prepared A working solution was prepared as follows Reagent 1 2 150 mg reagent 2 were dissolved in 100 ml reagent 1 stability 3 months at 2 8 C The determination was performed according to the following methods A Kinetic two point method The volumes, in microliters ul , used in the assay volumes could be proportionally modified, when require were as follows lank Sample StandardSample serum, plasma or 50 p1 diluted 1 100 urine Reagent 1 2 600 ul 600 1 600 ulReagent 3 400 ul 400 pl 400 til Standard 20 mg dl urea nitrogen in distilled waterDistilled water 50 pi Only one blank and one standard were carried out for each series of tests. The reaction was carried out at 370C and the absorbance read at 410 nm with an automatic analyzer lst reading after 30 seconds, 2nd reading after 120 seconds from the start . The calculation for serum or plasma samples was done by the following formula Example blank Urea Nitrogen mg dl x 20 Bstandard B blank where AE was the increase of absorbance in the given time interval. An aqueous standard was used since plasma proteins do not significantly interfere. For urine samples tulle results were multiplied by 100. The method was linear up to at least 120 mg dl urea nitrogen in the sample. Recovery tests carried out adding known amounts of urea to a pool of human plasmas gave aii average percent recovery of 99.0 in the range of linearity.Assays of human sera or plasmas carried out in conlpariso with the urease Berthelot method, gave a correlation coefficient r 0.997 in the range of linearity. B Kinetic one point method The volumes used in the assay volumes could he proportionally modified, when required were as follows Blank Sample StandardSample serum, plasma or 20 ul diluted 1 100 urine Reagent 1 2 1.5 ml 1 .5 ml 1.5 mlReagent 3 10. ml 1.0 ml 1. mlStandard 20 mg dl urea nitrogen in distilled water 20 p1Distilled water 20 ul Only one blank and one standard were carried out for each series of tests. The reaction was carried out at 37OC and the absorbance at 410 nm read with an automatic analyzer after 1 minutes from the start. The calculation for serum or plasma samples was done by the following formula Sample EblankUrea nitrogen mg dl x 20 Standard Eblank where E was the absorbance at the given reading time. An aqueous standard was used since plasma proteins do not significantly interefere. For urine samples the results were multiplied by 100. The method was linear up to at least 120 mg dl urea nitrogen in the sample. Recovery tests carried out adding known amounts of urea to a pool of human plasmas gave an average percent recovery of 99.3 in the range of linearity.Assays of human sera or plasmas carried out in comparison with the urease Berthelot method, gave a correlation coefficient r 0.995 in the range of linearity. C Equilibrium method The volumes used in the assay were the same as in the previous method. The reaction was carried out at 37 C and, after 1 1 2 hours, the solution was removed from the incubator and diluted to 10 ml with water and the absorbance read at 410 nm with a spectrophotometer.The calculation was the same as in the previous method. The method was linear up to at least 120 mg .dl urea nitrogen in the sample. Recovery tests carried out adding known amounts of urea to a pool of human plasmas gave an average percent recovery of 98.4 in the range of linearity. Assays of human sera or plasmas carried out in comparison with urease Berthelot method gave a correlation coefficient r 0.986 in the range of linearity. Thus, DHD has been shown to give reliable results in determinating urea nitrogen in both a one step and a two step kinetic assay as well as in the equilibrium method.Results correlated very well with those obtained using the standard Berthelot method and were free of the disadvantages in prior urea assay methods. Example IIAssay of Urea Nitrogen in Body Fluids with Acetylacetone and Formaldehyde Reagent preparations used in the assay were as follows Reagent 1 the same as in Example 1Reagent 2 the same as in Example 1Reagent 3 Acetylacetone analytical grade Reagent 4 Formaldehyde 35 analytical grade Working solutions were prepared as follows Reagent 1 2 the same as in Example 1Reagent 3 4 13.6 ml of reagent 3 and 5.2 ml of reagent 4 were mixed and made up to 10 ml with distilled water. The determination was performed by tlve same methods described in Example 1, using the same assay procedurcs and obtaining similar performances. Linearities were the same, percent recoveries and correlation coefficients were very close to those of Example 1. Example IIITest Device Assay of Urea Nitrogen in Body 4 luids with DHD DHD was first synthetized as follows 100 ml acetylacetone and 39 ml formaldehyde 35 were dissolved in 50 ml ethanol and let stand at room temperature for 3 days. The solvent was removed under vacuum and 63 g DHD were recovered as an oil by distillation b.p. 120 1250C at 0.05 mm Hg . The elemental analysis calculated for C11H1604 was C, 62,26 H, 7.55 and that found was C, 61.21 ll, 7.70.

The devices were then backed with double faced adhesive tape and fixed thereby to plastic handles. The test papers thus obtained were dipped in human serum or plasma and, after 12 minutes at room temperatule, the yellow color obtained was visually compared with a suitable color scale normal values of urea nitrogen did not give significant color response, while values highcr than normal did. The same test papers were dipped human urine and, after 2 minutes at room temperature, the yellow color obtained was visually compared with a suitable coloi scale. Normal values of urea nitrogen did not give significant color response, while values higher than normal did.Neither plasma proteins nor substances present in urine other than urea interfered. Example IVAssay of Urea Nitrogen in Body Fluid with Acetylacetone and Acetaldehyde Reagent preparations used in the assay were as follows Reagent 1 the same as in Example 1Reagent 2 the same as in Example 1Reagent 3 13.6 ml acetylacetone 3.7 ml acetaldehyde both analytical grade reagents made u to 100 ml with distilled water.A working solution was prepared as follows Reagent 1 2 the same as in Example 1The determination was performed according to the kinetic two point method.

The calculation was the same as in Example 1. The method was linear u i to at least 120 mg dl urea nitrogen in the sample. Recovery tests carried out adding known amounts of urea to a pool of human plasmas gave an average percent recovery of 98.8 in the range of linearity. Assays of human sera or plasmas carried out in comparison with the urease Berthelot method, gave a correlation coefficient r 0.992 in the range of linearity. Although the invention has been described with particularly, numerous changes in the details may b resorted to without departing from the scope of the invention.
