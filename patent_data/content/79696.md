# Monoclonal antibodies specific for the human transferrin receptor glycoprotein.

## Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies are produced specific for the cell surface transferrin receptor of human cells. Animals are inoculated with purified human transferrin receptor glyco protein, human hematopoietic cells or fragments thereof, and spleen cells obtained from the animals are fused with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. The hybridomas are cultured as clones, and antibodies obtained from the indi vidual clones are tested for their specificty for human transferrin receptor. Clones which produce antibodies speci fic for the receptor and that interfere with or block transferrin binding are selected for further culturing to produce the antibody, and the antibody is obtained from the culture growth medium or from ascitic fluid of an animal bearing a tumor of the hybridoma. Monoclonal antibodies which block transferrin binding are useful in regulating cell growth and for other therapeutic uses.
