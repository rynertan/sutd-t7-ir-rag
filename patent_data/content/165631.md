# Method of manufacturing a body having an opening tear, the body manufactured, and a metal plate out of which the body is to be manufactured.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a body in which of a folded metal plate having an opening tear terminating in a tongue, overlapping edges are welded together, characterized in that at the opening tear the welding intensity is decreased as such that either solely tin melting occurs so that at the opening tear the edges are linked by melted tin, or welding is interrupted and thereafter a slot formed at the opening tear between the overlapping edges is covered using a sealing material. Further the invention relates to a metal plate having an opening tear formed by two weakening scores extending traverse to its edges and terminating in a tongue, characte rized in that at the opening tear one of the edges is provided with a covering and or oxide layer which has a relatively smaller electrical conductivity, to the body manufactured and to a container comprising same.
