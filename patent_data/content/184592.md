This reaction and the others disclosed as described above produce polymers of random and relatively uncontrollable structure and properties. Among the results may be high susceptibility to heat distortion and lo glass transition temperature. Moreover, the use of an acyl chloride as a orecursor may result in the presence of residual chloride in the polymer, an unacceptable situation for certain utilities for example as electrical insulators . Copending application Serial No. RD 13,32 , filed of even date herewith, disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, discloses and claims novel copolyamideimides free from many of these deficiencies, prepolymer intermediates therefor, and methods for their preparation. It remains of interest, however, to prepare copolyamideiniides havinq such properties from relatively inexpensive startinq materials. A principal object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide novel copolyamideimides. A further object is to orovide copolyamideimides with relatively high glass transition temperatures and resistance to heat distortion. A further object is to provide relatively simple methods for the preparation of copolyamideimides as described above. Other objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. In its broadest sense, the present invention is directed to acid extended copolyamideimides prepared by a method which comprises the steps of 1 reacting, under conditions whereby all water of reaction is removed A at least one diamine having the formula I H2N R1 NH2 wherein R1is a divalent hydrocarbon based radical, with B at least one carboxy anhydride of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R2 is a trivalent hydrocarbon based radical, and C at least one dianhydride of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R3 is a tetravalent hydrocarbon based radical the molar ratio of reagent C to reagent B being at least about 0.25 1 and the ratio of equivalents of reagent A to anhydride equivalents of reagents B and C combined being about 1 1 and subsequently 2 reacting a mixture of 0 the product of step 1, or a functional derivative thereof, and F at least one dicarboxylic acid having the formula IV HOOC R7 COOH, or a functional derivative thereof, wherein R7 is a divalent hydrocarbon based radical containing about 3 12 carbon atoms, with E at leapt one of diisocyanates having the formula V OCN R NCO and diamines having the formula VI RSNH R4 HR6 wherein R4 is a divalent hydrocarbon based or polymeric radical and each of R5 and b6 is independently hydrogen or a lower hydrocarbon based radical. As used herein, the term hydrocarbon based radical denotes a radical free from acetylenic and usually also from ethylenic unsaturation, having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character within the context of this invention. Such radicals include the following 1 Hydrocarbon radicals that is, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic substituted aromatic, aromatic substituted aliphatic and alicyclic radicals, and the like. Such radicals are known to those skilled in the art examples are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, decyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, a naphthyl,B naphthyl and biphenylyl all isomers being included . 2 Substituted hydrocarbon radicals that is, radicals containing non hydrocarbon substituents which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon character of the radical. Those skilled in the art will be aware of suitable substituents examples are halo, alkoxy especially lower alkoxy , carbalkoxy, nitro, cyano and alkyl sulfone. 3 Hetero radicals that is, radicals which, while predominantly hydrocarbon in character within the context of this invention, contain atoms other than carbon present in a chain or ring otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Suitable hetero atoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for example, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and silicon. For the most part, not more than three substituents or hetero atoms will be present for each 10 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon based radical. An exception comprises molecules in which silicon is a hetero atom, which may, for example, contain three hetero atoms for as few as 4 carbon atoms. Reagent A according to this invention is at least one diamine having formula I. The R1 value therein is most often an aromatic hydrocarbon radical containing about 6 20 carbon atoms or a halogenated derivative thereof, an alkylene or cycloalkylene radical containing about 2 20 carbon atoms or a bis alkylenepoly dialkylsiloxane radical. The aromatic hydrocarbon radicals are preferred. Examples of suitable diamines of formula I are ethylenediamine, propylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, heptamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, 2,11 dodecanediamine, 1,12 octadecanediamine, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 4,4 dimethylheptamethylene di amine, 5 methylnonamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2,2 dimethylpropylenediamine, N methyl bis 3 aminoprooyl amine, 3 methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 1 ,2 bis 3 aminopropoxy ethane, bis 3 aminopropyl sulfide, 1,4 cyclohexanediamine, bis 4 aminocyclohexyl methane, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, 2,4diaminotoluene, 2,6 diaminotoluene, m xylylenediamine, p xylylenediamine, benzidine, 3,3 dimethyl benzidine, 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine, 1,6 diaminonaphthalene, 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, 4,4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 2,4 bis amino t butyl toluene, bis p B methylo aminopentyl benzene, 1 ,3 diamino 4 iospropylbenzene, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether and bis 3 aminopropyl tetramethyldisiloxane. Mixtures of these diamines may also be used. Particularly preferred are the aromatic diamines, especially m phenylenediamine and 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane the R1 radical is then eitherEMI5.1 tb preferably SEP 4CH3 SEP orCH SEP 2 tb In reagent B the carboxy anhydride as defined by formula II, R2 is usually a trivalent aliphatic radical containing about 2 20 carbon atoms or, preferably, a trivalent aromatic radical containing about 6 20 carbon atoms. Illustrative carboxy anhydrides are trimellitic anhydride, 5 chlorotrimellitic anhydride, benzene 1,2,3 tricarboxylic acid anhydride and carboxysuccinic anhydride. The preferred carboxy anhydrides are those in which R2 is an aromatic and especially an aromatic hydrocarbon radical. Trimellitic anhydride is most preferred. In reagent C the dianhydride as defined by formulaIII, R3 is a tetravalent radical which is typically analogous to those previously described with reference to R1 and R2.A number of suitable dianhydrides are disclosed in columns 5 6 of U.S. Patent 4,061,622 and in U.S. Patent 4,331,799. The disclosures of both of said patents are incorporated by reference herein. A particularly preferred group of dianh 4 ides of formula III comprises those in which R3 isEMI6.1 wherein R4 is oxygen, sulfur, SO2 , , lower alkylene the word lower as used herein denoting up to 7 carbon atoms or, most desirably, o R5 and R5 is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbonbased radical. is most often a divalent radical derived from benzene or a substituted benzene, biphenyl or a substituted biphenyl, or a diphenylalkane which may contain substituents on one or both aromatic radicals.The following radicals areEMI6.2 tb preferred SEP as SEP R5 SEP R6 tb SEP VII SEP t tb SEP CH, SEP Y SEP Y SEP FH tb SEP VIII tb SEP R6 SEP y SEP yn SEP 6 tb SEP Y SEP 7 tb SEP Ix 75 SEP R tb SEP Y SEP Y tb wherein each R6 is independently hydrogen or methyl, R7 is a straight chain or branched alkylene radical containing 1 5 carbon atoms and is most often the isopropyidene radical, and each Yis independently hydrogen or halogen usually chlorine or bromine .Mixtures of the foregoing formulas are also contemplated. Most preferred is the radical derived from bisphenol A Ei.e., 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane by the removal of both hydroxy groups therefrom, and having fonnula IX wherein R7 is isopropylidene and each Y is hydrogen. Thus, the most preferred dianhydride for use as reagent C is 2,2 bisL4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride, hereinafter referred to as pbisphenol A dianhydride . Step 1 in the method of this invention is ordinarily effected by merely blending reaqentsA, B and C and heating to a temDerature at which said reaction takes place. The reaction with the two anhydrides may be simultaneous i.e., reagents B and C used together or sequential i.e., reagent C added first, followed by reagent B however, simultaneous reaction is usually preferred since no particular advantage results from sequential addition. The reaction temperature is typically within the range of about 100 200 C, and at least partially above about 1600C to insure removal of all water of reaction and complete imidization of any amic acids formed. It is usually advantageous to carry out the reaction in a substantially inert organic diluent. Typical diluents are such aprotic solvents as benzene, toluene, xylene, o dichlorobenzene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sul foxi de or N methylpyrrolidone. A factor in step 1 is the difference in reactivity with reagent A of intramolecular anhvdride nd carboxylic acid moieties. The reaction of a diamine with intramolecular anhydride moieties is strongly favored over that with carboxylic acid moieties. This selectivity insures production of a carboxy terminated prepolymer. It is frequently preferred to include in the reaction mixture a catalytic amount of at least one tertiary amine, which may be aliphatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic. Suitable amines include triethylamine, N methylpiperidine and 4 dimethylaminopyridine. The required amount of tertiary amine is small, typically about 0.05 0.5 by weight based on the total of reagents A, B and C. The molecular weight of the prepolymer intermediate produced in step 1 will depend to a larae extent on the molecular ratio of reaaent C to reagent B in the reaction mixture, with higher molecular weight prepolymers being obtained as the Droportion of reagentC is increased. Molar ratios of at least about 0.25 1 are within the scope of the invention. A ratio of at least 0.5 1 is preferred, since lower ratios will produce a prepolymer in which some molecular species contain moieties derived from reagents A and B only. There does not appear to be any upoer limit to this molar ratio, although a higher value than about 5 1 usually affords no particular advantage. The proportion of reagent A in the reaction mixture is determined so as to produce a carboxy terminated prepolymer.This is effected by using a ratio of equivalents of reagent A to anhydride equivalents of reagents B and C combined of about 1 1, typically about 0.95 1.05 1. The term anhydride equivalent as used herein is based on the number of anhydride groups theoretically present per molecule, with free carboxylic acid groups being disregarded thus, one mole of reagents B and C is one and two anhydride equivalents, respectively. One mole of reagent A is two equivalents thereof, since two amino groups are present per molecule. Under these conditions, only the anhydride groups react with reagent A and the free carboxy groups become the terminal groups in the prepolymer. Structural evidence indicates that the orepolymer intermediates produced in steo 1 have thevformula EMI8.1 wherein R1 3 are as previously defined. In formula, the value of n will theoretically be twice the molar ratio of component C to component B. As said molar ratio varies from 0.25 1 to 5 1, therefore, the average value of n will vary from 0.5 to 10 and is preferably at 19 st 1. The preparation of prepolymers bv steD 1 of the method o, this invention is illustrated by the followinq exainules. All oarts are weight. EXAMPLES 1 6 A mixture of 19.2 grams 0.1 mole of trimellitic anhydride reagent B , bisphenol A dianhydride reagent C , a stoichionetric amount of m phenylenediamine 1PD or ,4 diaminc diphenylmethane MCA reagent A with respect to anhydride eauivalents of reagents B and C, 9.01 part of 4 dimethvlaminoDyridine, 30 parts of N methylpyrrolidone and 47 parts of toluene was slowly heated to 1300C, during which time the mixture became homoaeneous and a toluene water azeotrope began to distill. Heating was continued to approximately lBO0C as water was removed by distillation.The residue was a solution of the desired prepolymer. The reagents, proportions and other pertinent data for Examples 1 6 are given in Table I. TABLE I Mole ratio, Example Amine C B 1 MPD 0.5 2 MPD 0.25 3 MPD 1.0 4 MCA 0.5 5 MDA 1.0 6 MOA 1.5 For the formation of the acid extended nolvamideitides of the invention step 2 , a mixture of the product of steD 1 or a functinncll derivative thereof reagent D and reagent F described hereinaftar is reacted with reagent E which may be a diisocyanate or a diamine. If reagent D is the prepolymer itself, the reaction forming the polyamideimide proceeds most effectively when reagent E is a diisocyanate, and involves the condensation of one carboxylic acid moiety with one isocyanate moiety to form an amide linkage with the elimination of one mole of carbon dioxide. A corresponding carboxylic acid amine reaction is somewhat slow and difficult, so if reagent E is a diamine it is preferred to use as reagent D a functional derivative of the prepolymer such as an acyl halide thereof. For electrical uses of the polyamideimides, however, where the presence of halide ions may be detrimental, and also for the sake of simplicity of production, the reaction between the prepolymer and the diisocyanate is preferred. Frequent reference hereinafter will be made to diisocyanates as reagent E, but it should be understood that diamines may be substituted therefor under appropriate conditions. The diisocyanates and diamines suitable for use as reagent E have formulas V and VI, respectively. In these formulas, R4 may be a divalent hydrocarbon radical similar to R1 in formula I. It may be the same as R1 or different. When reagent D is a diamine, each of R5 and R6 may be hydrogen or a lower hydrocarbon based radical, preferably a hydrocarbon radical and still more preferably a lower alkyl especially methyl . When R5 or R6 is other than hydrogen, the reaction thereof with the acid moiety in the prepolymer will form anN substituted amide linkage. Such linkages are, of course, not formed when reagent E is a diisocyanate. Illustrative diamines suitable for use as reagent E include those recited hereinabove with reference to reagent A, as well as, for example, the corresponding N,N dimethyl compounds.Illustrative diisocyanates are p phenylene diisocyanate, 2,4toluene diisocyanate, 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, xylene diisocyanates, mesitylene diisocyanate, durene diisocyanate, 4 methoxy 1,3phenylene diisocyanate, 4 chloro 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate, 4 i sopropyl 1 ,3 phenylene diisocyanate, the tolidine diisocyanates, dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4 methylenebis phenyl isocyanate , 4,4 methylenebis o tolyl isocyanate , 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylisocyanate , 1 ,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, 4,4 bis isocyanatophenyl ether, 2,4 bis isocyanatophenyl ether, and 4,4 bis isocyanatophenyl sulfone. Mixtures of the foregoing isocyanates are also contemplated.The preferred diisocyanates, from the standpoint of availability, low cost and particular suitability for preparing the polyamideimides of this invention, are 2,4 toluene diisocyanate 2,4 TDI , 2,6 toluene diisocyanate 2,6 TOI , and 4,4 methylenebis phenyl isocyanate MDI . Reagent E may also be an isocyanate or amineterminated polymer, such as a polyamide or polyurethane. In that case, R4 is a polymeric radical and the product is a block copolymer with polyimide and polyamide, polyurethane or similar blocks connected by amide linkages. As previously mentioned, step 2 of the method of this invention is the reaction of a mixture of reagents D and F with reagent E. Reagent F is at least one dicarboxylic acid having formula IV, or a functional derivative thereof whether the free acid or a derivative thereof is used will depend on the structure of reagent D, the same functional groups being present in reagents D and F. The R7 value in formula IV is a divalent hydrocarbon based radical containing about 3 12 carbon atoms such as trimethylene, tetramethylene, hexamethylene, decamethylene, m phenylene, o phenylene, p tolylene, p chlorophenylene or 1 ,4 naphthylene. Alkylene radicals containing 3 6 carbon atoms and aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, especially the latter, are preferred.Most preferably, R7 is at least one of the m and p phenyl ene radicals. In step 2, a mixture of reagents D, E and F is normally heated to a temperature within the range of about 150 225 C until carbon dioxide evolution is complete.The reaction may be effected in a substantially inert organic diluent such as those previously listed with reference to prepolymer formation. In general, molar ratios of reagent F to reagent D may be as high as 2 1 but are preferably up to about 1.5 1.There is no real lower limit for said ratio, but a value less than about 0.1 1 rarely offers any advantage. The most preferred values are from about 0.4 1 to about 1.25 1. The ratio of equivalents of reagents D and F combined to reagent E the equivalent weight of each being half its molecular weight may be varied in accordance with the polymer molecular weight desired. In general, ratios between about 0.5 1 and about 2 1 are contemplated, these being the minimum and maximum values which will produce a product containing at least two prepolymer , acid or diisocyanate derived units. Ratios from about 0.67 1 to about 1.5 1 are preferred since products of higher molecular weight are then obtained. The most preferred ratio is about 1 1.Because the reaction between reagentsD, E and F normally does not proceed to completion, it is frequently advisable to analyze the reaction mixture for free acid groups after the initial reaction with reagent E, and subsequently to add an additional increment thereof effective to reduce the residual acid content to less than about 1 . Most often, no more than about 10 by weight of the original amount of reagent E is required for this purpose.Thus, a ratio of equivalents of reagents D and F combined to reagent E between about 0.9 1 and about 1 1 is especially preferred. It is also contemplated to incorporate in the reaction mixture minor amounts of chain stopping or endcapping reagents, typically monoisocyanates such as phenyl isocyanate, monoamines such as aniline, monocarboxylic acids such as benzoic acid or monoanhydrides such as phthalic anhydride. It is believed that the copolyamideimides of this invention consist essentially of units having the formulaEMI12.1 wherein R1 7 and n are as previously defined, the ratio of units of formula XI to those of formula X being approximately the same as the molar ratio of reagent F to reagentD. Because of some uncertainty regarding tis structure, however, they are also appropriately definel in terms of the method for their preparation. The copolyamideimides of this invention normally have weight average molecular weights from about 30,000 to about 150,000. The intrinsic viscosities thereof, determined in dimethylformamide at 25 C, are in the range of about 0.2 0.9 dl. g. The preparation of acid extended copolyamideimides by step 2 of the method of this invention is illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLES 7 9 To 0.1 equivalent of the prepolymer of Example 1 was added a measured amount of dicarboxylic acid. After all toluene was removed by distillation, the temoerature of the mixture was raised to 150 1900C and a solution of an equivalent amount of 2,4 toluene diisocyanate in 50 ml. of o dichlorobenzene was added over 1 hour. After carbon dioxide evolution was complete, the mixture was titrated to determine the Dresence of free acid and the additional amount of diisocyanate calculated to neutraloze the free acid was added. The solution was cooled, dissolved in dimethylformamide and precipitated by pouring into methanol. The copolyamideimide was removed by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven. The compositional details and properties of the products of Examples 7 9 are given in Table II. Intrinsic viscosities were determined in dimethylformamide at 259C.

They are also useful for application in solution to electrical conductors made of copper, aluminum or the like, particularly wires, as insulating coatings. If desired, additional overcoats of polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformals, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene or the like may be further applied to such insulated conductors.
