# Delivery nozzle for use with a mineral fibre pumping apparatus.

## Abstract
A delivery nozzle 10 for application to pumping apparatus for mineral fibre at least when used as insulation comprises a body member 10 that substantially reduces in cross section between an input part 12 of a first constant cross section, e.g. 50 mm circular, and an exit part 15 of a second constant cross section, e.g. 22 mm circular. The exit part 15 is vented at a cross section less than the first cross section of the body member. The verting 31 comprises a branch 132 , which is directed forwardly and downwardly of the nozzle, and a gate valve 40 capable of adjustably varying the effective orifice of the venting. The venting is arranged substantially parallel to a cut off 30 of an end portion of the nozzle.
