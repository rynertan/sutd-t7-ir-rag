# SOLAR RAY COLLECTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A solar ray collecting device in which solar rays are focused by a lens and guided into an optical fiber and transmitted through the optical conductor onto an adequate desired portion for use in illumination or for others pur poses. A solar ray collecting portion is comprised of a large number of lenses arranged on a same plane and an optical fiber, the light receiving edge of which is precisely posi tioned at the focal position of the respective lenses, a hor izontal hollow shaft for rotatably supporting the solar ray collecting portion, a vertical hollow rotating shaft elongated in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal hollow shaft and supporting the same unitarily. A drive means for rotat ably moving the solar ray collecting portion mounted on the horizontal hollow shaft around the same.
