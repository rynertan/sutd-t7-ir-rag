## Description
ENZYIfATIC INORGANIC PHOSPHATE ASSAY FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the field of test compositions and, more particularly, to test compositions useful for determination of inorganic phosphates in fluids, such as urine or blood serum or plasma . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2 An assay for inorganic phosphates, HP04 2 and H2P04 , is especially useful as a diagnostic tool.For example, serum inorganic phosphate concentration is elevated in healing bone fractures, hypoparathyroidism, Paget s disease, acromegaly, dehydration and is decreased in vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, hyperinsulism, asteaaalacia, hyperparathyroidism and the like. Prior art methods for determining inorganic phosphates Pi in biological fluids can be grouped into two categories chemical and enzymatic methods. All the chemical methods require strongly acidic conditions. The resulting hydrolysis of unstable organic phosphates present in biological fluids causes erroneously high values for inorganic phosphate. Several enzymatic methods for the determination of inorganic phosphate have been proposed. Schulz,D.W. et aZ., 19, AnaZ. Bioch., 300 1967 , proposed an enzymatic method for the determination of inorganic phosphate based on the use of phosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. The reduced form of nicotine adenine dinucleotide NADH is generated. The NADH formed is monitored spectrophotometrically in the ultraviolet region and is directly proportional to the concentration of inorganic phosphate in the sample. Scopes,R.K., 49, AnaZ. Dioenem., 88 1972 proposed the use of an alternative enzymatic route in which phosphate assay is based on the use of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase.The resulting assay also required monitoring of NADH in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. A third enzymatic pathway for the assay of inorganic phosphate was proposed by Misaka et al., inU.S. Patent No. 4,246,342 based on the use of pyruvate oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide generated was monitored in the visual range with a Trinder type indicator system, 4 aminophenazone and a substituted aniline. W. I. Hwang, et aZ., 55, Anal. Biochem., 379 1973 , proposed another enzymatic method for the determination of inorganic phosphate Inosine PiPurine nucleoside phosphori lase EMI2.1 Hypoxanthine i Ribose l phosphate H poxanthine 2H20 202Xanthine oxidaseEMI2.2 CEC 1.2.3.2 Uric acid r 2H202 wherein the uric acid produced is monitored in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum at 290 nanometers nm . This method, however, was not applied to biological samples, where the presence of large amounts of endogenous uric acid would require a sample blank. Plebe R. J., et aZ., 19, Biochem. Genetics 921 1981 utilized the Hwang reaction sequence to visualize gel electrophoresis bands of phosphate generating enzymes, using Nitroblue Tetrazolium as a chromogen. The method was used as a qualitative means of detecting isozymes which liberate inorganic phosphate. Machida, Y. et aZ., 46, Agri. BioZ. Chem., 807 1982 , utilized the Hwang reaction sequence for the assay of inorganic phosphate. When a particular xanthine oxidase obtained from terobacter cloacae was used in the assay, the concentration of Pi could be measured in the visible range by following the production of hydrogen peroxide with a Trinder indicator system, 4 aminoantipyrine and phenol. Machida states that a quantative assay in the visible region could not be accomplished with milk xanthine oxidase.Bovine milk xanthine oxidase is the only commercially available xanthine oxidase source. one of these enzymatic methods provides a sensitive, accurate convenient assay for inorganic phosphate from commercially available materials. SUS ARTY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a sensitive, accurate, reproducible assay for inorganic phosphate.Since the assay utilizes readily available commercial materials and is monitored in the visual range of the spectrum, it is convenient for routine clinical application. A test composition, device and method are disclosed which enable the enzymatic assay of inorganic phosphates in a fluid sample including body fluids, such as urine and blood serum or plasma . The composition comprises inosine, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, xanthine oxidase and a tetrazolium salt. A fuller understanding of the invention will be attained by referring to the following description and claims. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBCD,rETS The assay composition includes ionosine, purinenucleoside phosphorylase, xanthine oxidase and a tetrazolium salt. Additionally, a buffering substance capable of providing a pH in the range of from about 5 to 12, must be present. The buffer can be incorporated into the assay composition or added to the sample prior to assaying for phosphate content. Preferably, the assay composition also includes an electron mediator.Other components, such as stabilizers, surfactants or dispersants can be added without departing from the scope of the invention. The concentration of formazan formed is proportional to the phosphate concentration at any given time, therefore either an end point method or a rate assay method can be used. The measurement of inorganic phosphate is accomplished according to the following sequence of reactions Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase 1 Inosine PiEMI4.1 Ribose l phosphate Hypoxanthine EC 2.4.2.1 xanthine oxidase 2 Hypoxanthine tetrazolium saltEMI4.2 xanthine formazan EC 1.2.3.2 xsnthine oxidase 3 Xanthine tetrazolius saltEMI4.3 uric acid formazan EC 1.2.3.2 All the assay components are commercially available. A particularly preferred xanthine oxidase is that obtained from bovine milk, although any xanthine oxidase can be used. The tetrazolium salt can be either 2,3,5 aromatic substituted derivatives of 1,2,3,4 tetrazole, or ditetrazolium compounds in which two tetrazolium rings are linked by an aromatic grouping. Examples of useful tetrazolium salts are 3 4 ,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl 2,4 diphenyl 2H tetrazolium bromide MTT or Thiazolyl Blue , 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitro phenyl 5 phenyl 2H tetrazolium chloride INT 3,3 3,3 dimethyoxy 4,4 diphenylene bis 2 p nitro phenyl 5 phenyl 2H tetrazolium chloride Nitroblue tetrazolium or NBT and 3,3 dimethoxy 4,4 diphenylene bis 2,5 p nitrophenyl 2H tetrazolium chloride Tetranitroblue tetrazolium or TNBT .The tetrazolium salt, 3 4 ,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl 2,4 diphenyl 2H tetrazolium bromide MTT or Thiazolyl Blue is particularly preferred. Formazan color formation by the tetrazolium salt indicator can be accelerated by the addition of an electron mediator. Phenazine salts, such as phenazine methosulfate and l methoxy phenazine methosulfate, and other compounds, such as 8 dimethyl amino 2,3benzophenoxazine Meldola Blue , 7 amino 3 imino 3Hphenothiazine Thionine or tetramethylamidophenthiazine chloride methylene Blue can be used. A preferred electron mediator is l methoxy phenazine methosulfate.Suitable buffers for incorporation into the assay composition or addition into the sample before assay include Tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane N 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid 3 N morpholino propanesulfonic acid, N,N bis 2hydroxyethyl 2 aminoethanesulfonic acid, Ntris hydroxymethyl methyl 2 aminoethanesulfonic acid, N 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine propanesulfonic acid and diethanolamine. All the above are capable of providing a pH in the range of from about 5 to 12.In a preferred embodiment the pH is within the range of 6.0 to 11.0.

One I.U. is the enzyme activity required to catalyze the conversion of one micro mole of substrate per minute at specified conditions of pH and temperature. For purine nucleoside phosphorylase, the I.U. indicated above is measured for the sub strate inosine at pH 7.4 and 25 C. For xanthine oxidase, the I.U. above is measured for the substrate hypoxanthine at pH 7.6 and 25 C. One International Unit per liter I.U. L is one International Unit of enzyme activity per liter L of stock solution. The composition can be used in aqueous solution form prepared with solvents, such as water, physiological solution, or in mixtures of water and organic solvents, such as methanol. The reagents can be provided in a kit format, e.g. , a series of bottles containing one or more of the above components, either in solution or as a premixed lyophilized powder or as a tablet which can be reconstituted for use as a single working solution. The kit can contain optionally a suitable phosphate standard. Alternatively, the composition can be incorporated into a carrier matrix to provide a dry test device. In either case the assay is performed by contacting a sample containing inorganic phosphate with the assay composition and measuring the color formed by the formazan dye. The color formation is usually measured instrumentally in the visible range, generally between 500 and 600 nanometers, with a colorimeter or visible photometer. Since the color developed at any given time is proportional to the phosphate concentration, either an end point method or a rate assay method can be used. Alternatively, the color formation can be determined with visual reading alone if an appropriate color chart is sup plied, resulting in a semiquantitative assay. The term carrier matrix , as used herein, refers to any means suitable for containing specified amounts of the test composition. Many such materials are known. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,846,247 3,522,928 4,046,513, 4,046,514 FrenchPatent No. 2,170,397 and British Patent Nos. 1,369,139 and 1,340,623 among others. It is, therefore, to be appreciated that in producing a test device of the invention, all such carrier matrix concepts can be employed, as can others. The matrix can include a system which physically entraps any or all of these ingredients, such as polymeric microcapsules which rupture upon contact with an aqueous solution. The presently preferred method of preparing a dry test device, however, is to impregnate a porous carrier matrix, e.g., filter paper, with the composition, followed by affixing of the impregnated matrix to a support member. The impregnation can be accomplished merely by dipping one piece of filter paper into a solution of the composition.Drying can be accomplished by any means which will not deleteriously affect the impregnated composition, usually by means of an air oven. The dried paper can thereafter be cut and mounted on one end of a support member, for example, a rigid or semi rigid polystyrene film strip. Mounting of the paper on the strip can be accomplished through use of a double faced adhesive tape, such as that commercially available from the 3MCo. as DOUBLE STICK commat . The test device is conveniently used by momentarily dipping it in a test sample or by otherwise introducing a test sample into the carrier matrix, whereby a detectable change e.g., color results when inorganic phosphate is present. The following, Examples I and II describe an assay for inorganic phosphate performed using the test composition of the present invention in solution form. Example III illustrates a procedure for preparing a test device. While the examples serve to illustrate the invention, they are not to be interpreted as limiting its scope, which is defined solely by the claims appended hereto. One skilled in the art will be able to make such variations, substitutions and changes in the components of the composition and ingredients and reaction parameters as may seem desirable. EXAMPLE ITest Composition, Solution Form The test composition was prepared in aqueous solution according to the formulation below. The chemicals and enzymes used are commercially available. Since the assay is directed toward a determination of phosphate, all preparations were essentially phosphate free.Test Composition inosine 0.45 mM purine nucleoside phosphorylase 90 I.U. L xanthine oxidase 9 I.U. L 3 4 ,S dimethyl 2 thiazolyl 2 4 diphenyl 2H tetrazolium bromide 0.6 ml l methoxy phenazine methosulfate 30 pM Tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, pH 7.50 150 mMSurfactant Tritons X 100 0.3 w v A series of phosphate standards was prepared. A 2.0 milliliters ml portion of the above test composition was added to a 0.02 ml aliquot of each of the phosphate standards and absorbance measurements taken at 578 nanometers 1 centimeter pathlength after 15 minutes. Absorbance of a reagent blank was subtracted from the test absorbance to give the true absorbance value. The values given were plotted absorbance versus phosphate concentration in milligrams per deciliter to provide a standard curve.Absorbance of the phosphate standards was linear with increasing phosphate concentration see Table I . TABLE I phosphate mg dl absorbance 2.5 0.263 5.0 0.526 7.5 0.785 10.0 1.050 15.5 1.579 Body fluid samples were tested in a similar manner. Sample phosphate concentration was determined by comparing the true sample absorbance values to the standard curve. EXAMPLE IIPercent Recovery of Inorganic Phosphate Added to a Serum Pool When known amounts of phosphate were added to sera, or pools of sera, previously assayed for phosphate, the percent recovery total phosphate found minus phosphate originally found expressed as a percent of phosphate added averaged 100.48 seeTable II . TABLE II Percent Recovery of Inorganic Phosphate Added to a Serum Pool Phosphate added mg dl Percent recovery 1.25 99.5 2.50 100.0 5.00 101.0 8.00 99.0 11.00 102.0 15.00 101.0 average 100.4This recovery demonstrates that the composition of the present invention is capable of quantitative measurement of phosphate in solution. EXAMPLE IIIPreparation of a Test Device A test device for the enzymatic determination of inorganic phosphates is prepared by incorporating the test composition of Example I into a carrier matrix.For example, Whatman No. 17 filter paper can be immersed in a solution containing the test composition and dried at 600C in an air oven. A 2.5 x 2.5 centimeter square of the dried impregnated paper is affixed to a polystyrene strip with double faced adhesive tape to form a test device. The device is conveniently used by momentarily dipping it into a fluid sample or by otherwise introducing the sample into the carrier matrix. A detectable color change results when inorganic phosphate is present. Since the color developed depends on inorganic phosphate concentration, a semiquantitative assay is possible when an appropriate color chart is supplied. A quantitative assay is possible when an appropriate reflectance reading instrument is used. Other formats such as a tablet or reagent matrix can be used to prepare the test device. Obviously, many other modifications and variations of the invention as set forth may be made without departing from the spirit or scope thereof.
