# Foldable stand.

## Abstract
A foldable stand for holding a card or the like for easy viewing. The stand includes a base and a supporting member pivotal with respect to each other. A pivot body carries the pivot pin, and carries a stop pin that extends into the vertex between the base and the supporting member as the members are rotated in opposite directions. The pivot body also carries a trough that is aligned to carry the card or the like when the stop pin is in position to limit the rotation of the base and supporting members.
