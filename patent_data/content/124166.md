# Waveform converter circuit.

## Abstract
A waveform converter circuit for producing an output square waveform, having a unity mark space ratio, from an input sinusoidal waveform which can have a large peak to peak amplitude range and a large d.c. level range. As shown in Figure 5, the circuit comprises a differential ampli fier 12 which receives the input waveform 17 at the input . The output of the amplifier 12 is applied to a D type flip flop 13. The flip flop
