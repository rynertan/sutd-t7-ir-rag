# Telecommunications cable containing optical fibres.

## Abstract
A submarine telecommunications cable includes a plurality of optical fibres in the bore of an orientated plastics strength member. The cable may have an average density of 0.9 to 4.0 and preferably a neutral buoyancy whereby most of the weight of the cable is carried by the sea. This reduces tension in the cable during laying. The bore of a submarine cable is filled with a solid elastomeric embedding medium which occupies the space between the fibres. This gives a void free structure which assumes ambient pressure. The strength member may be made from orientated polyethylene. The cable is preferably buried in the sea bed during use.
