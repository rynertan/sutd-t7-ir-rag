# Coloured anodised finishes.

## Abstract
Aluminium articles having porous anodic oxide films are given an exposure resistant blue colouration by dipping them first in an aqueous solution of a phosphomolybdic acid or a silicomolybdic acid, and then in a solution of a strong reducing agent such as a stannous salt, and finally sealing the porous oxide film. The method is suitable for batch or continuous operation and useful to colour bumpers for passenger cars.
