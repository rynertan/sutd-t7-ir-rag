## Abstract
Process for the preparation of 7 acylamino 3 thio substituted methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1 oxide derivatives by reacting a 7 acylamino 3 bromomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1 oxide derivative with a si lylated thiol of the general formula R S Si CH₃ ₃ I wherein R represents an organic group, preferably a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group, which reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert or ganic solvent at a temperature between 20 and 80 C thereby obtaining the corresponding 7 acylamino 3 R thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1 oxide derivati ves, many of which are valuable intermediates in me thods for the preparation of therapeutically active cepha losporins.
