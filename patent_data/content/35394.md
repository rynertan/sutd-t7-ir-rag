# Apparatus for field flow fractionation.

## Abstract
A long, thin annular belt like channel is shown for use in sedimentation field flow fractionation. This channel, which may be contained in the rotor of a centrifuge, has a generally rectangular cross section and inner and outer walls 22, 23. It has an inlet tube 100 which extends through the inner channel wall 23 and is positioned to introduce particulates 25 including particles and or macromolecules approximately at the radial distance 1 from the outer wall where 1 is the equilibrium distance resulting from the aver age force field exerted on each particulate by the centrifugal force field and by the opposing normal diffusion forces due to Brownian motion. An outlet tube 104 for the channel is similarly located. A modified design tapers the channel at the inlet and or outlet.
