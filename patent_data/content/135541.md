## Description
This invention is in the fields of cell biology and immunology, and particularly relates to a novel immunoassay device and method for the determination of antigenic substances. Antigens on the surface of cells can be detected by their specific reactivity with antibodies in a number of ways. The most commonly employed methods are immunofluorescence staining, radiobinding assays and complement mediated cell lysis. In each method, the reactivity of cells with a particular antibody to a cell surface antigen is determined separately, that is, the cells are incubated separately with each antibody to be tested. For example, in a complement mediated cell lysis assay using microtiter plates, cells are incubated with antibody separately in each well of the microtiter plate. Usually, the microtiter plate is purchased with the desired antibodies frozen in the wells. After cells are added to each well and allowed to interact with antibody, complement is added along with a dye. Cells having antigens to which the antibodies bind are lysed and the lysed cells take up the stain. In this way cells to which antibodies have bound may be determined by visually inspecting the microtiter plate. Frequently the number of individual tests in certain determinations can be very large. For instance, in tissue typing where the cell surface allo antigens encoded by the gene loci of the histocompatibility complex are determined, at least 80 individual tests are required to determine the allotypes of the HLA A, B, C and DR transplantation antigens of a person. Such a large number of determinations entails a great deal of repetitive pipetting. Repetitive pipetting is undesirable because it is time consuming and because it increases the chance of error. Also a large number of determinations generally demand a large amount of sample and reagents which oftentimes are limited in supply because they are difficult or costly to obtain. This invention exploits the phenomenon of immunoadherence to arrive at a simple yet powerful technique for the determination of specific antigenic substances on the surface of cells. In its broadest sense this invention constitutes a novel immunoassay device and method for detecting antigenic substances. The invention is especially useful for determining the presence of particular antigens on the surface of cells, but is not limited to this use alone, as it may be employed for determining antigens in solution as well. The device essentially comprises a pattern or array of minute antibody coated spots on the surface of a support said pattern or array being in a form of dot matrix. Each antibody coated spot is made up of antibodies of a different and distinct specificity. The spots serve as tiny, specific immunoadsorbents of cells. The expression of particular surface antigen by cells may be detected by determining to which antibody coated spot the cells bind. A large number of different antibody coated spots can be assembled on a very small portion of the surface of the support. The invention represents a major simplification of existing immunocytological and immunochemical methodology in that it eliminates the need for repetitive pipetting when a large number of individual tests for different antigens are performed such as in tissue typing. Other significant advantages of the invention are that all tests with antibodies may be performed simultaneously in one location, only a single application of sample is required as opposed to the repetitious pipetting of sample into a large number of separate wells or tubes, and very small amounts of sample and reagents are consumed. Also this invention eliminates the need for costly reagents such as complement which is required, as its name implies, in the complement mediated cytolysis technique. EP A 0117019 describes immunoassay methods useful for detecting soluble and cell surface antigens which methods involve the use of patterns of immunological reactions formed on solid phase surfaces. EP A 0 063 810 discloses devices and kits for immunological analysis wherein antibodies, antigens or immunoglobulins are applied e.g. as an array of dots to a solid porous support which is thereafter treated to prevent non specific binding. Typical samples to be analysed are suitably diluted antisera, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, colostrum, lymphatic fluid, milk, saliva, urine and stools. In contradistinction to EP A 0 063 810 the present invention is directed at an immunoassay device and methods specific to cell surface antigens, and antibody coated spots on the device contain the antibodies at such a density and uniformity that cells bearing the appropriate surface antigen will themselves adhere tightly and uniformly to the appropriate spots such whole cell adsorbing analysis devices are not disclosed in EP A 0 063 810. According to one aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided an immunoassay device comprising a support having a substantially planar surface and having an array of small, discrete, closely spaced antibody coated areas on the planar surface said array being in the form of a dot matrix, the antibodies in each discrete, antibody coated surface area being adsorbed uniformly to the planar surface in sufficient density such that said area is capable, when the cells to be detected bearing a complementary surface antigen are brought into contact therewith, of binding the cells tightly to the said discrete, antibody coated area as a layer of bound cells which is substantially microscopically uniform over essentially all of the said discrete antibody coated area. For example, the invention provides an immunoassay device for tissue typing wherein the substantially planar support surface has an array of anti HLA antibody coated spots thereon, said array being in the form of a dot matrix. The invention also provides a method of producing an immunoassay device as defined in the last preceding paragraph which comprises the steps of According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an immunoassay method which involves using a support having a substantially planar surface and having an array of small, discrete, closely spaced antibody coated areas on the planar surface said array being in the form of a dot matrix, the antibodies in the discrete, antibody coated surface areas being densely and uniformly adsorbed to the planar surface and bringing the cells to be detected bearing a surface antigen into contact with the discrete, antibody coated areas to cause the cells to adhere tightly to a discrete, antibody coated area containing antibodies complementary to the surface antigen as a layer of bound cells which is substantially microscopically uniform over essentially all of that discrete antibody coated area, thereby to permit identification of the said antigen. This immunoassay method can be used for determining the presence of particular antigens on the surface of cells comprising the steps of The immunoassay method can also be used for determining the proportion of cells bearing specific surface differentiation antigens in a mixed population of cells, by Figure 1 shows the binding of mononuclear cells from an individual with allotype HLA A2 to anti HLA A2 antibody spots on glass surface.

Figure 3 shows the binding of thymocytes from AKR J, BALB c, and their F1 to antibody matrixes containing anti Lyt 2.1 and anti Lyt 2.2. Figure 3a shows schematically the arrangements of the two antibodies in the matrix. Coating of antibodies, application of cell samples, and photography were described in the Examples.

Figure 3d is the cell binding result with thymocytes of BALB c. The immunoassay device of this invention comprises a support which has on its surface an array of antibody coated dots spots . The support is a solid substance having a flat, planar surface such as a glass or plastic coverslip. The antibody coated dots form small spots on the surface of the support surrounded by uncoated surface space. The antibodies in the antibody coated spots are conjugated to the surface of the support they may be either covalently or non covalently bound thereto. The most preferred arrangement of the spots on the surface of the support is a rectangular matrix. A matrix arrangement permits any spot to be readily identified by reference to coordinates giving the row and column number of the particular spot. The antibody spots should be closely spaced, thereby minimizing the surface space occupied by the complete arrangement of spots and in turn, minimizing the amount of sample needed. For instance, a 10 spot by 10 spot matrix should occupy about 1 cm² or less of the surface of the support. In accordance with the invention, each spot, or each of certain sets of spots such as the spots in one row or column , is made up of antibodies of single distinct specificity. Each spot, or each set of spots, contains antibodies whose specificity is different from the specificity of antibodies in the other spots. Thus in an 100 spot matrix 100 antibodies of different specificity may be tested. The antibody coated spots serve as minute, specific immunoadsorbents for antigens with which the antibodies react. Antibody coated spots made up of antibodies directed against a particular surface antigen of cells serve as specific immunoadsorbents for cells bearing that surface antigen. The density of antibodies in the antibody coated spots is related to the function of the spots as immunoadsorbents of cells. The density of coated antibodies, either covalently or non covalently conjugated to the surface of the support, must be such that the cells bind tightly to the spots and remain bound during ordinary manipulation of the device in subsequent procedures for detecting cell binding. It is suspected that bridges between the surface antigens of the cells and the antibodies attached to the surface of the support must be numerous in order to achieve tight cell binding. Preferably, however, the density of antibodies should be sufficient to yield, upon contact with an appropriate concentration of cells which have surface antigens that bind to the antibodies, a microscopically uniform layer of bound cells covering the entire antibody coated spot. The formation of such a uniform layer of cells is desirable because it facilitates detection of spots to which cells have attached. The density required to generate a microscopically uniform layer of cells is probably greater than the density minimally sufficient for tight cell binding. The immunoassay device of this invention is produced by applying small volumes of antibody solutions to the surface of the support and allowing the solutions to remain on the support until the antibodies become adsorbed to the surface. If desired, the antibodies may be chemically bound to the surface of the support by employing conventional methods for covalently binding proteins to a solid phase. The solutions of antibodies may be applied to the surface in the form of tiny droplets. The volume of the droplet, of course, determines the size of the antibody coated area. Preferably, the volume should range between 0.005 0.5 µl to yield antibody coated dots with diameters of 0.25 mm 1.0 mm. The droplets should be placed on the surface so as to conform to the desired arrangement of antibody coated spots. The solution can be delivered by micropipet, or by other suitable means. Preferably the applicator should permit application of droplets to the support surface in precise positions to cover uniform areas of substantially the same size. Any means for applying the solutions other than in the form of droplets, as for example, a device that makes direct contact with the surface of the support to transfer the antibody solution thereto, should meet the same requirements. The preferred concentration of antibodies in the solution applied to the surface for coating is about 10 µg ml. It appears this is the optimal concentration for most antibodies. But because the binding of protein is dependent on its proportion in solution as well as its concentration, the solutions of antibodies must also be highly enriched in order to obtain a sufficiently dense antibody coat for the desired cell adherence. Monoclonal antibodies can be obtained in adequately enriched solutions for producing the antibody coated spots. As more monoclonal antibodies against cell surface antigens become available, antibody matrixes for the determination of a wide range of antigens can be devised. Also polyclonal antibodies may be obtained in adequately enriched solutions for the purposes of this invention. After the solutions of various antibodies have been applied to the surface of the support and allowed to remain on the surface for the time necessary for adsorption or binding to occur, the entire surface of the support is flooded with a solution of protein or a solution of serum in order to dilute the unadsorbed antibodies and in order to block uncoated spaces and non specific binding sites on the surrounding surface of the support. This protein solution is left on the surface for about 5 10 minutes. The device is then washed with distilled water and dried. The device may be used immediately, or it may be stored until use. When the device is finished, antigen determinations can be performed in as little as 1 2 hours. Briefly, the method of using the device is as follows. Cells to be tested for the presence of certain surface antigens are placed in suspension in normal saline and applied to the surface of the device so that the cell entirely covers all the antibody coated spots in the matrix. The number of cells needed to cover the entire matrix depends upon the size of the matrix and the type of cell. Generally, however, approximately 2 x 10⁶ cells in a volume of 200 µl are sufficient to cover all antibody spots in a 1 cm² matrix of spots. After the suspension of cells is applied to the surface of the support as above, the cells are allowed to settle to the surface and react with the antibodies in the spots. Next, non adherent cells are removed from the surface. This can be accomplished by washing and agitating the device or by any other suitable method which does not disrupt the adhered cells. The matrix of antibody spots is examined to determine to which spots cells have bound. Cells may be fixed and stained to aid in identifying the spots to which they have adhered. The immunoassay device of this invention can be used not only to determine the presence of a specific antigen on the surface cells, but also to analyze functionally different cell subpopulations that express distinct differentiation antigens. It has been established that an antibody coated solid surface can adsorb quantitatively from a mixed population of cells the cells that bear the specific surface antigen with which the antibody react. The antibody matrix method of this invention could be used to determine the proportion of specific subsets in a mixed population, for example, the proportion of B cells, T cells, and monocytes in the mono nuclear cell population or the proportion of inducer and suppressor T cells in the T cell population. Since the murine monoclonal antibodies that react specifically with all these cells are available, an immunoadherence device and method to accomplish the aforementioned may be developed. Although these tests can now be done with fluorescence flow cytometry where each individual antibody analyzed separately, the antibody matrix method allows multiple determinations to be performed simultaneously. The following examples are intended to illustrate more fully the invention. Various amounts of mouse anti human HLA A2 antibody 10 µg ml , ranging from approximately 0.005 0.5 ul, were applied to small 11 x 22 mm glass cover slips. Amounts larger than 0.05 µl could be measured and delivered. The amount of solution in droplets smaller than 0.05 µl was estimated by the number of droplets per unit volume delivered. For example, if 20 droplets resulted from the delivery of 0.1 µl, the average size of the droplets was 0.005 µl. After the cover slips were prepared as described above, peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from individuals with allotype A2 were applied to the antibody coated areas. After binding, nonadherent cells were washed away adherent cells were fixed with formaldehyde and dried. Cover slips were examined with a regular microscope and photographed with a stereomicroscope. Figure 1 shows the 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm diameter dots at 50 times magnification. The glass surface is microscopically uniform. Table 1 summarizes the cell adsorbing capacity of antibody dots of varying sizes. The cover slips were placed on a heamacytometer and total number of cells were estimated from the number of cells in a unit area and the diameter of the dots. The numbers probably represent the maximal capacity, since almost all space in the dots is filled. The smallest 0.25 mm dots are still easily visible and can contain 1100 cells. These numbers should be within the limits that can be quantitated somehow with automatic analytical instruments. If antibodies of relevant but distinct specificities can be prepared and purified, they can be coated on a small area on a solid phase and used to analyze antigens. The most convenient organization of such antibody dots would appear to be arrays as exemplified in Fig. 2, in which one hundred antibody dots were arranged in a 10 x 10 matrix square. In this example, mouse anti human HLA A2 was the antibody, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an individual with A2 allotype was the cell antigen. Table 2 elucidates the analytical capacity of antibody matrixes. The discussion was based on a matrix area of 1 cm². Assuming all antibodies are available, the typing for the HLA A, B, C, and DR, which have about 80 allotypes altogether, can be performed with one cell sample application. With the 0.25 mm dots, the tests of each individual allotypes can be repeated five times. It is apparent that the analysis of the cell binding results would be facilitated with proper instruments. Table 2 also indicates that each individual antibody matrix may have the capacity equivalent to one or several microtiter plates. Assuming mononuclear cells are 7 µm in diameter some are obviously larger , a square of 1 cm² may be completely covered with 1.5 x 10⁶ cells. In fact, in the present studies 5 x 10⁵ calls in 50 µl and 2 x 10⁶ cells in 100 µl were applied on areas of 0.25 cm² 5 x 5 matrix and 1 cm² 10 x 10 matrix , respectively. Since one ml of blood contains on the average 1 x 10⁶ mononuclear cells, a few ml of blood is enough for a 1 cm² antibody matrix test. The antibody matrix requires only very small amounts of reagents. If an antibody is coated at 10 µg ml concentration, which is optimal for most antibodies, 1 mg antibody can make 200,000 antibody dots of 0.5 mm diameter see Table 3 . Because the binding of a protein to a solid surface is dependent on not only its concentration but also its proportion in the solution, a specific antibody has to be rather enriched to be coated successfully. There are not many such antibodies available yet the present studies use the antibodies that react with the allotypes of mouse T cell surface differentiation antigen Lyt 2 to examine the specificity of cell binding to antibody dots in antibody matrix. Anti Lyt 2.1 and Lyt 2.2 monoclonal antibodies have been developed, and isotypes of the antibodies can be readily isolated from ascites of mice bearing the specific antibody producing hybridomas. Fig. 3a shows schematically how the two antibodies are coated alternately to form 5 x 5 matrixes. The size of the matrixes are 0.5 cm ² and the size of the dots is 0.5 mm in diameter. Thymocytes from AKR Lyt 2.1 , BALB c Lyt 2.2 , and AKR x BALB c F1 Lyt 2.1 and 2.2 were applied on the matrixes on a cover slip. Fig. 3b, 3c, and 3d show that AKR cells bind to only anti Lyt 2.1 spots, BALB c cells bind to only anti Lyt 2.2 spots, and cells of their F1 bind to both spots. The binding is very specific. In a single cell binding assay using 5 x 5 matrix as shown in Fig. 3, the test with anti Lyt 2.1 was repeated thirteen times and the test with anti Lyt 2.2 twelve times. It is contemplated that this invention will be employed in clinical and research laboratories in tests or procedures requiring multiple antigen determinations.
