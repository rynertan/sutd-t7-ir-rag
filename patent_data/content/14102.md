# Thermostat.

## Abstract
A thermostat for insertion into a power supply line by means of terminals 14 and 15. Within the thermostat, a switch including contacts 16 and 20 and a flexible member 22 which can flex about a fulcrum point 24, 26, is actuated according to ambient temperature, by means of a bimetallic disk 32 acting through a pushrod 30. In normal operation, 24 and 26 are held in contact with each other by a further pushrod 36 which is supported on a fusible block 44, in turn supported on a metal plate 42. However, if the thermostat becomes over heated, block 44 melts, removing the support from pushrod 46, and this enables spring 54 to push the resilient element 22 down wards so that it parts from the inner end of terminal 15 at 24, 26. This ensures that in such circumstances the circuit through the thermostat is broken, irrespective of the condition of the contacts 16 and 20 at that time. It can be appreciated that point 24 on resilient element 22 and point 26 on the inner end of ter minal 15 serve as a pair of normally closed electrical contacts in series with the contacts 16 and 20.
