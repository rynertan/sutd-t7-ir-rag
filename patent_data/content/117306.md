# Hydrogen peroxide synthesis.

## Abstract
This invention relates to improvements in palladium carbon catalysts for the production of hydrogen peroxide from a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of an aqueous liquid capable of inhibiting the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The improvement comprises using a catalyst wherein the carbon base is non graphitic and has a surface area greater than 400 mÂ² g and wherein the pal ladium catalyst is prepared by impregnating the carbon base with a soluble palladium compound, drying the thus impregnated carbon base and reducing the palladium com pound with which the carbon base is impregnated to pal ladium with hydrogen at 40 140 C.
