# CIRCUIT FOR APPLYING A VOLTAGE TO A MEMORY CELL MOS CAPACITOR OF A SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
A voltage applying circuit 6 is adapted to a semicon ductor memory device comprising a plurality of memory cells 1 which each include MOS memory capacitors 3 one terminal of each being connected to a common point. The output terminal of said voltage applying circuit is connected to the common point of the MOS capacitor 3 , and a low voltage for normal operation of the MOS capacitor 3 and a screening voltage for distinguishing a memory device, which is higher than that voltage, are selectively applied to the common connection point.
