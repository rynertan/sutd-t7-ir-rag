# Improved process for producing dimensionally stable polyolefin foams using environmentally acceptable blowing agent systems.

## Abstract
The use in conventional polyolefin extrusion foaming pro cesses of a stability control agent e.g., stearamide, EAA copo lymer. etc. in conjunction with certain mixed blowing agent systems, the mixed blowing agent system containing 50 95 weight percent of 1 chloro 1,1 difluoroethane or 1,1 difluoro ethane and 5 50 weight percent of an eventually halogenated hydrocarbon having a normal atmospheric boiling point of from 0 C to 50 C, e.g. ethyl chloride. These compounds have a shorter atmospheric lifetime than the chlorofluorocarbons presently used as blowing agents.
