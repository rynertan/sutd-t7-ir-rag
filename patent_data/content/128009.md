## Description
SYNERGISTIC COMPOSITION COMPRISING GAMMA INTERFERON AND LYMPHOTOXIN, AND ITS PREPARATION.Background The present invention relates to the field of inhibition of tumor cell growth, specifically using cytotoxic and cytolytic agents. In particular, the present invention relates to the combined use of lymphotoxin and gamma interferon in such inhibition. Lymphotoxin has neen inplicated in the regulation of the immune system and has been reported to inhibit tumor cell growth both in vivo see, e.g. Kahn, A. et al. Hematolooy and Oncology, 11 128a 1981 and in vitro see e.g. Gately, M.K. et al. irr nunol., 27 B2 1976 . Under in vitro conditions, it is a more potent inhibitor of tumor cells than of normal ones from the same species see e.g., Evans, C.H. et al. Cancer Res. 35 1035 1975 .Lymphotoxin may be assayed by its cytotoxic and cytolytic effects, as well as its capacity to inhibit cell growth. Earlier studies have been done with relatively impure preparations, however, recently, a preparation of lymphotoxin homogeneous with respect to specified criteria, and with a specific activity of the order of 10 100 million unitslmg was disclosed in U.S. Appl. Serial No.403,671 filed July 30, 1982, incorporated herein by reference, and published as European Patent Application Publication No. 0100641. Gamma interferon IFN y has also been shown to have anti viral and anti tumor activity. Preparation of IFN y by recombinant techniques, and its amino acid sequence were disclosed in U.S. Appl.Serial No. 312,489 filed October 19, 1981 incorporated herein by reference, and published as European Patent Application PublicationNo. 077670, April 27, 1983. Thus, the nature and tumor inhibition activity of both of these compositions is known. It has previously been shown that IFN y exhibits a synergistic effect with a or ss interferon in assays for cell growth inhibition, as disclosed in U.S.Appl. 436,758, filed Oct. 25, 1982,corresponding to the European patent application published underNo. 107,498, and incorporated herein by reference. It has also been shown that leukocyte interferon IFN a is synergistic with lymphotoxin in growth inhibition studies see Williams, T.W. et al., J. Immunol., 130 518 1983 . The present invention is directed to the dramatic synergism in tumor cell inhibition which is observed when combinations of gamma interferon and lymphotoxin are administered to such cells. Summary of the Invention This invention concerns the surprising synergism of lymphotoxin and IFN y in cooperating to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Accordingly in one aspect the invention is directed to a composition of matter comprising human gamma interferon HuIFN y in admixture with human lymphotoxin HLT and to a process for the preparation thereof. In other aspects the invention concerns processes for inhibition of tumor cells using such a mixture, and of treating subject mammals to curb tumor cell growth. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows dose response curves for human lymphotoxin alone, HuIFN alone, and HLT HuIFN y combinations with respect to a standard assay for tumor cell growth. Figure 2 shows the results of a comparison of treating normal cells and tumor cells with HuIFN y and HLT separately and in mixtures.Detailed DescriptionA. Definitions Both lymphotoxin and HuIFN V comprise peptide sequences.Accordingly, such sequences can be found either in un ionized form or as salts. It is recognized that when in pharmaceutical compositions or in solution, the ionization status of such molecules is entirely pH dependent. It is further recognized that such substances can be supplied in preparing compositions or solutions either as unionized materials or as their salts. Accordingly, the terms lymphotoxin or HLT and gamma interferon orc HuIFN y refer to these organic moities regardless of their status with respect to the ionization states of their contained amino and carboxyl groups. Pharmaceutically acceptable refers to preparations which are in such form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredients to be effective, and which contain no additional components which are toxic to the subjects to which the composition would be administered. Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions or excipients refer to compositions or excipients which can reasonably be administered to a subject mammal to provide an effective dose of the active ingredient employed. Compositions containing HulFN y and HLT in synergistically effective amounts refers both to composi ions prepared by pre mixing these active ingredients in vitro and to compositions which result from tandem administration of each of these active ingredients either in solution or in admixture with excipients to a subject mammal. It is clear that the synergistic effectiveness of such compositions is independent of the manner of mixing and of the temporal mode of treatment within at least a relatively short time frame. Synergism in the context of this invention is defined according to the accepted definition disclosed in Goodman, A.et al. The Pharmacoloqical Basis of Therapeutics, MacMillanPublishing Co. Inc., New York 1980 . This is mOt easily seen in terms of the construction of an isobologram which plots the dosage levels required for a specific identical biological response of each of two ingredients along the X and Y axes. While simply additive effects would generate a straight line as one ingredient diminishes and the other increases, synergistic effects can be recognized by the generation of a concave curve, such that only a small increase in one component compensates for a drastic decrease in the amount of the other.B. Demonstration of Growth Inhibition Synergism An isobologram demonstrating the HLT, HuIFN y synergism of the present invention is shown in Figure 1. Also given for comparison are results of individually administered dose levels of these components. in the assay, human lung carcinoma h 549 cells were grown in microtiter wells at a cell density of 5,000 cellsiwell in a 0.2 ml volume and then exposed either to HLT or to HuIFN y or the comDination of tne two for tnree aays. intact cell nuiliDers remaining viere exaininea Dy stalnitig the cells witn crystal violet ana assaying color intensity. As shown in Figure 1A, 60 percent cell growth inhibition was achieved wit approximately 15,000 units of human lymphotoxin.Figure 1B indicates that 60 percent inhibition would require at least 1,500 units of HuIFN y. However, as shown in the isobologram of Fig. lC, the combination of, for example, only 100 200 units ofHuIFN y witn 1,000 units of human lymphotoxin is sufficient to acnieve 60 percent inniDition. This effect is demonstrated to be unique to tumor cells inFigure 2. In that assay, normal cells were grown in the left microtiter plate and human lung fibroblast cells in the right hand microtiter plate to a level of 10,000 cells well in 0.2 ml of medium. HuIFN y, HLT, or a comDination of the two were added as shown and the plates incubatea for 4 days. In the right hand plate, containing tumor cells, wnile some inhibition was achieved with HuIFN y or HLT alone, cell growth was completely eliminated by the combinations of the two components. For example, adaing only 100 units of lympnotoxin to cells treatec with 5,000 units of y interferon completely destroys growth, while eitner treatment alone permits consiserable growth to take place. This effect is absent from tne normal cell plate shown at the left. Accordingly, it is clear that compositions containing bothHuIFN y and HLT are surprisingly effective in inhibition of tumor cell growth, out relatively harmless to normal cells. Such compositions can be administered either by pre mixing the HuIFN z and HLT ingredients, or by in vivo mixing i.e. tanaem administration of each separate active ingreaient. C. Utility and Aaministration Administration of the compositions hereof can be via any of the acceptea modes of administration for agents which exhibit such activity. These methods include oral, parenteral or topical administrations and otherwise systemic forms. Local or intravenous injection is preferred. Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compositions used may be in the form of solid, semi solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspensions, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages.The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceuticals agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. Such excipients may include other proteins, such as, for example, human serum albumin or plasma preparations. For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades or mannitol, lactose starch, or magnesium stearate. Liquid pharmaceutically administerable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. if desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art for example, see Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences,Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, 15th Edition, 1975. The composition or formulation to be auministereo will, in any event contain a quantity of tne active component s in an amount effective to achieve tne aesirea effect in tne subject being treated. The amount of active compound auministerea will, of course, De dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the juagment of the prescribing physician. While extrapolation from in vitro levels to in vivo levels is not completely predictable, it is estimated that a suitable composition for treating a subject mammal with the composition of the invention sufficient to inhibit tumor growth would range from a combination of about 20 units of HuIFN y with 20C units of HLT per kg of body weight to a combination of about 100 units of HulFN y with about 1,000 units of HLT per kg of body weight. However, the invention cannot be restricted to these specific ranges because of the variability in severity of affliction, and the susceptibility of the individual patient as noted above.
