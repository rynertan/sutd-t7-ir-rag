# SYNCHRONOUS POWER RECTIFIER AND APPLICATIONS THEREOF

## Abstract
A synchronous power rectifier of high efficiency incor porates a bipolar power transistor 33 operable by a con trol circuit 80 in a switching mode to rectify the energy from a secondary winding N32 of a power transformer T31 . The synchronous rectifier reduces or eliminates the need of rec tifier diodes, which provides power rectification without the power loss associated with the rectifier diode voltage drops. Moreover, the rectifier switching time is adjustable to ac commodate delayed turn off times of bipolar power devices, as well as the switching signal duration to provide regulation of the output voltage Vo independent of the excitation of the primary of the transformer T31 .
