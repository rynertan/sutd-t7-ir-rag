The compound number of the active ingredient corresponds to the one in Table 1. Formulation Example 1 50 parts of the compound No. 3 or No. 43 as active ingredient, 3 parts of calcium ligninsulfonate, 2 parts of sodium laurylsulfate and 45 parts of synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide are well mixed while being powdered to obtain a wettable powder.Formulation Example 2 2 parts of the compound No. 10 or No. 37, 14 parts of polyoxyethylenestyryl phenyl ether, 6 parts of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 30 parts of xylene and 48 parts of isophorone are well mixed while being powdered to obtain an emulsifiable concentrate.Formulation Example 3 2 parts of the compound No. 9 or No. 27, 1 part of synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide, 2 parts of calcium ligninsulfonate, 30 parts of bentonite and 65 parts of kaolin clay are well mixed while being powdered. The mixture is then kneaded with water, granulated and dried to obtain granules.Formulation Example 4 25 parts of the compound No. 9 or No. 34, 3 parts of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, 3 parts of CMC and 69 parts of water are well mixed and pulverized until the particle size of powders becomes less than 5 microns to obtain a suspension. The organic phosphorous quinoxalinone I thus formulated in any suitable composition form is useful for the pre or post germination control of undesired weeds by means of soil or foliar treatment as well as flood fallowing treatment. These treatments include the application to the soil surface prior or subsequent to planting, and the incorporation into the soil. The foliar treatment may be effected by spraying the herbicidal composition over the top of plants. Otherwise it may be applied directly to weeds if good care is taken to keep the chemical off the crop foliage. The herbicidal composition may be used in mixture or blend of some other herbicide to improve their activity, and in some cases, a synergistic effect can be expected.Further, they may be applied in combination with insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, fungicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, soil improvers, etc. Use as Herbicides The dosage rate of an organic phosphorous quinoxalinone I of this invention as active ingredient in a herbicide may vary depending on prevailing weather conditions, site condition, preparation used, prevailing season, mode of application, soil involved, crop and weed species, etc. Generally, however, the dosage rate ranges for 0.5 200 g, preferably 1 100 g of the active ingredient per are. The herbicidal composition formulated in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate, a wettable powder or a suspension may ordinarily be employed by diluting it with water at a volume of 1 10 liters per are, if necessary, with addition of an adjuvant such as a spreading agent.Examples of the spreading agent include, in addition to the surface active agents as noted above polyoxyethylene resin acid ester, ligninsulfonate, abiethylenic acid salt, dinaphthylmethane disulfonate, paraffin, etc. The herbicidal composition formulated in the form of granule may normally be applied as it is, without dilution.
