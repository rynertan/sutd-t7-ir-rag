# TWO TERMINAL NICAD BATTERY CHARGER WITH BATTERY VOLTAGE AND TEMPERATURE SENSING

## Abstract
Method and apparatus is disclosed for measuring battery temperature and battery voltage during battery charging. The system is designed to charge a battery using two charging ter minals and sensing battery voltage and temperature through the charging terminals. In measuring the temperature of the battery, the battery is electrically isolated from the sensing cir cuit during a portion of the charging cycle where the charging voltage is less than the battery voltage. Should the tempera ture of the battery, as measured, increase to a predetermined upper limit, the charging cycle is switched to a trickle charge on the battery. The battery voltage is measured at the instant when charging voltage exceeds the battery voltage to give a true indication of the recharged potential of the battery. When the sensed battery voltage is at the desired level, charging is switched to trickle charge. The system provides battery tem perature and voltage sensing by the use of two terminal battery construction which is superior to the existing three and four terminal battery charging constructions.
