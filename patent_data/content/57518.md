# Immediate ignition and smokeless burning of waste gases.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 for immediate ignition of waste gases and their smokeless burning which is built into a cylindrical stack 20 , for the flow of waste gases 24 . Near the top of the stack, there is positioned, coaxially, a steam air pipe 28 for supplying a mixture of steam and air. The steam and air are in troduced into the pipe, by means of radial tubes 28A, 28B connected to a circular manifold 14 on the outside of the stack 20 . A circular cover plate or baffle 50 over the steam air pipe 28 is supported by a plurality of broad strips 50 equally spaced circumferentially, around the periphery of the steam air pipe 28 . There are a plurality of radial support arms 68 between the stack 20 and the steam air pipe 28 . These can be made from angle iron of sufficient width, the purpose being to deflect upwardly flow of the annular column of gas 26 , to break it into a plurality of spaced circular segments of gas 26A , the space 67 above the arms 68 protects a stable flame, for instant re ignition of the mixture of gas, air and steam.
