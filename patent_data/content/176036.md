## Description
METHOD OP PRODUCING CEBONACEOUS BODIES The invention relates to a method of producing carbonaceous bodies, in particular electrodes, such as anodes of parallelepipedal, cubic, or cylindrical shape for producing aluminum or steel, by calcining raw shaped bodies containing pyrolyzable substances, in an oxidizing medium within a tunnel type furnace wherein the distillation products, e.g. volatile organics issuing in the temperature range of 2000 to 6000C and gaseous decomposition products or particulates are completely burned off. Carbonaceous bodies are produced, in general, from a mass of petroleum coke, anthracite, carbon black, graphite, or the like, which are added with a binder, such as, for example, tar and or pitch. As shaped bodies of such types are being fired, the binder is coked, thus yielding desired mechanical and electrical characteristics. The description which follows will make specific reference to the method as employed to obtain electrodes for aluminum production, it being understood that the same method may also be applied, with appropriate modifications, to the formation of electrodes for steel production. Anodes for the production of aluminum are mainly calcined, nowadays, in annular open chamber furnaces where they are stacked in layers comprising 6 to 8 anodes. Compared to the annular chamber furnaces of that type, tunnel type furnaces, as disclosed for example in published patents DEMOS 3042708 ant gp Oc 0103130, afford the following advantages improved reproducibility of the calcining conditions, improved hygiene of the work area, and possibility for thermal recovery. Tunnel type furnaces for anodes for the production of aluminum are comprised, in principle, of four zones a pre heating zone temperatures of the carbonaceous bodies up to about 200or , a combustion zone temperatures of the carbonaceous bodies up to about 600or , a firing zone temperature of the carbonaceous bodies of about 1000 12000C , and a cooling zone. In the calcining process with tunnel type furnaces, a number of trucks loaded with raw carbonaceous bodies are pushed into such furnaces at a speed generally in the range of 0.5 to 3 meters per hour. The shaped bodies are preferably contained in muffles placed on the trucks and, preferably, embedded in a powder filler containing carbon for protection against oxidation and deformation. The trucks are pushed through the furnace in conformity with a set temperature pattern, also called firing curve. The temperature pattern, or respectively, the heating rate resulting therefrom, is a decisive process parameter for the production of high quality fired electrodes. Once the firing curve of a tunnel type furnace is set, all the carbonaceous bodies are calcined in the same way, thereby a high degree of reproducibility is achieved. The trucks pushed through the tunnel type furnace may have, for example, a bottom surface measuring 5x4 meters. The trucks may carry one or more layers of the carbonaceous bodies. Calcining carbonaceous bodies in tunnel type furnaces presents a problem which is seldom observed or quite absent with annular chamber furnaces, i.e.the formation of cracks. This is to be attributed to physical and chemical changes occurring in the binders during calcination. There may be found two critical phases which are of decisive import to the formation of cracks and take place at two different temperature ranges the first critical phase is met between the softening temperature of the binder,and about 2000 C, where pitch is employed, in particular between 1300C and 180CC. In this temperature range, pitch becomes liquid. The carbonaceous body has a mechanical structure which weakens and cannot withstand the release of internal stresses. The second critical phase is met in the approximate range of 3500C to 550 C. During this phase, the binder is coked, while releasing at the same time volatile organics in the instance of pitch being used, inter alia also polycyclic aromatics which may be harmful to humans. Also in this case, a weakened mechanical structure of the carbonaceous body exists which can not always withstand expansion and contraction. In U.S. Patent No. US PS 4185055, an attempt is made to explain and describe the cracking phenomenon. The solution is seen in settling an exact g firing carve for a furnace operating in a reducing medium or atmot phere. However, besides the reducing medium requiring purification of the burned gases, and accordingly, raising costs enormously, the fired carbonaceous bodies fail to meet sll the requirements as regards the elimination of cracks. In view of the above situation, the inventors have set for themselves the task of providing a method of manufacturing carbonaceous bodies which can yield crack free shaped bodies at decreased costs and with high reproducibility, and involves no purification of the burned gases. This task is accomplished by a method for the production of carbonaceous bodies, in particular electrodes of parallelepipedic, cubic, or cylindrical shape for the electrolysis of aluminum by calcining raw shaped bodies containing pyrolyzable substances in a tunnel type furnace, characterized in that, at least until the binder within the carbonaceous bodies is fully softened, a weight subdivided homogeneously in conformity with the binder is caused to act on carbonaceous body covering surface s . With parallelepipedic carbonaceous bodies of elongate shape, crack formation can be prevented, according to the invention, by holding the shaped bodies upright at least until the binder has fully softened within the carbonaceous body. 3y virtue of the elongate design of the carbonaceous body, crack formation is prevented by gravity action if the the maximum temperature gradients specified herein below are maintained. In all cases, the longitudinal sides of this carbonaceous body, as set upright, should be much longer than their short sides. During heat application up to about 2000C, the temperature gradient reaches preferably a maximum of 100C per hour, in particular of about 40 to 60C per hour, while the subsequent heating to about 6000C corresponds preferably to a maximum of 500C per hour, in particular of about 200 to 300C per hour. Furthermore, actual tests have shown that where several layers of raw carbonaceous bodies are superimposed on one another, only the top one need be loaded with a special weight. The lower carbonaceous bodies are loaded with the weight of the overlying body, or bodies, which is effective to prevent the insurgence of cracks. While the covering surface of carbonaceous bodies laid in a single layer, or covering surface of the uppernost carbonaceous body in a multiple layer arrangement, may be also loaded with a heavy weight, this is avoided for economical reasons. A lower limit 2 of 70 kgw m has proved adequate. Preferably, however, one would operate with an evenly distributed weight 2 in the range of 100 to 280 kgw m on the covering surfaces of the carbonaceous bodies. In the manufacture of electrodes, preferably, a single layer of raw shaped bodies is placed on the trucks. This is specially advantageous because the exchange of heat during the heating and cooling steps alike, takes place at a fast rate. In principle, the weights may be at least in part removed at a temperature above 2000 C, the decisive phenomena to the formation of cracks occurring below this temperature level. Typical tunnel type furnaces may be designed such that the weights can be removed after the heating zone up to about 2000C . However, the weights may also be removed, without problems, even at á later stage, or may be left there until the calcining process is completed. In practice, tunnel type furnaces are advantageously designed to afford separate implementation of the pre heating furnace. Thus, the plate weights can be removed lon after the trucks loaded with the carbonaceous bodies have left the pre heating tunnel.Variations including pre heating furnaces which utilize the flue gases of a calcining furnace placed at a downstream location afford, in particular, energy savings. The plate weights used in accordance with this invention are expediently formed from a refractory ceramic material resistant to corrosion, and have a thickness, for example, of 2 15 centimeters, preferably of about 10 cm. In an industrial application particularly satisfactory have proved to be materials containing silicon oxide and or aluminum oxide, as well as silicon carbide or compounds thereof.Expediently, the plate weights have the same horizontal surface area as the carbonaceous bodies being calcined. As is usual with prior methods the raw carbonaceous bodies may be covered with a powder filler effective to prevent oxidation, generally containing carbon, e.g. metallurgic coke, petroleum coke, or anthracite. This covering is, in turn, covered with the plate weights. The determining load is calculated from the weights of the plates and the covering. The plate weights may also be placed directly onto the raw carbonaceous body and be then covered with the powder filler. In this case, preferably thin cover plates having a small weight are placed on the covering to restrict combustion of the powder filler.Thus, the load on the carbonaceous bodies would be given by the combined weights of the plate weights, covering, and cover plates. For the implementation of the inventive method, it is of no substantial importance whether the carbonaceous bodies to be calcined are or not packed in a box. If a box is used, the powder filler may be placed into an interspace formed by porous ceramic plates, and the raw carbonaceous bodies may be placed into the box such that they are held away from the powder filler. The plate weights would be placed directly onto the carbonaceous bodies. A cavity would be left between the shaped bodies and the box, laterally and or at the top. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, over the raw shaped bodies there is applied a protection layer containing A1203 and or ski02. In addition to the refractory oxides, this paint comprises, for example, borates and or phosphates and or alkaline salts. The layer is pernotis, up to about 6000C, to the volatile organic distillation products issuing from the binder and to the decomposition, gaseous or particulate, products, but not to the oxidizing medium. In the high temperature range, the protection layer is vitrified and becomes impervious in both directions. Where a protective layer is employed, both a box and the powder filler may be omitted. The invention will be further explained next with reference to the accompanying drawings, the vertical sectional views where of dhow diagrammatically examples from the manufacture of anodes for the aluminum industry modified as follows Figure 1 shows anodes packed in powder filler with plate weights Figure 2 shows anodes with plate weights placed directly thereon Figure 3 shows anodes packed in powder filler, but without plate weights Figure 4 shows two layers of anodes placed the one directly onto the other and packed in powder filler Figure 5 shows anodes with plate weights placed directly thereon, in a small box and Figure 6 shows anodes with plate weights placed directly thereon, in a large box. Figure 1 of the drawings shows a box 10 filled with powder filler 16, wherein the anodes 12 are immersed. Over the powder filler 16, there is arranged a horizontal layer of plate weights 14. The weight load on the covering surface of the carbonaceous bodies 12 varies from 100 to 400 kgw m2, where 30 200 kgw m2 are formed from the powder filler overlying the carbon 2 bodies, and 70 200 kgw m from the plate weights. In Figure 2, the plate weights 14 are shown laid directly on the carbonaceous bodies 12. The powder filler 16 which surrounds the bodies 12 is poured onto the plate weights 14 and covered, in turn, with lightweight ceramic covering plates 18, which prevent entrainment and or combustion of the powder filler 16.The weight load on the covering surfaces of the 2 carbonaceous bodies 12 is 70 280 kgw m2 and has the following composition plate weights 30 150 kgw mê, 2 powder filler 30 100 kgw.mê, and lightweight covering plates 10 30 kgw mê. In the embodiment of Figure 3, the carbonaceous bodies 12 are not introduced into a box but laid onto powder filler spread over a bottom plate 20 having a laterally raised edge 22. The carbonaceous bodies 12 are, in turn, covered with a relatively deep layer of the powder filler 16. The side edge 22 stops the powder filler 16 from falling out of the truck, while permitting of some flowing thereof. The powder filler in protected, in turn, by thin covering plates 18.The weight load of 160 400 kgs m on the covering surface of the carbon bodies 12 is constituted by the following two components powder filler 140 370 kgw mê, and thin covering plates 10 30 kgw mê. As shown in Figure 4, two directly superimposed horizontal layers of carbonaceous bodies 12 are packed in powder filler 16 within a box 10. The plate weights 14 are placed at the top, and no covering plates are required. On the covering surface of the top layer of the carbonaceous bodies 12, there is placed the same weight per unit area as in Figure 1. The bottom layer of the carbonaceous bodies 12 is also loaded with the weight of the top layer. After calcining, both layers of the carbonaceous bodies exhibit the same quality level and are crack free. Figures 5 and 6, differently from the embodiments illustrated thus far, show examples where the carbonaceous bodies 12 are not in direct contact, at least not laterally, with the powder filler 16. Thus, during calcining, the thermal expansion of the carbonaceous bodies 12 is left undisturbed. In a box 10, there are arranged porous supporting walls 24 of a ceramic material which are filled with powder filler 16. On the bodies 12 are placed plate weights 14. At a distance from the plate weights, a ceramic cover 26 carries the powder filler 16, which is protected, in turn, by covering plates 18. In Figure 6 there is shown a box 10 of a larger size which is constructed as shown in Figure 5.In Figure 6 however, on the covering surface of the carbonaceous bodies 12 there acts an additional weight because the covering or floor 26 acta on the plate weights 14 via supporting sectional members 28. A further embodiment, not shown in the drawing, consists of lowering the floor 26 until it is brought to bear directly on the outer sides of the plates 14.In this case, the supports 28 may be omitted, as may the plates 26 from the middle. This invention affords the following advantages the volatile substances from the distillation of tar and or pitch are completely burned because one would operate in an axidizing medium, which eliminates all the hazards of explosion where the carbonaceous bodies are packed with powder fillers, standard formulations may be used for their manufacture e.g. the pitch percentage need not be reduced the expansion of the carbonaceous bodies during the calcining process may be controlled and mechanical stresses only occur to a reduced extent in the finished carbonaceous blocks.
