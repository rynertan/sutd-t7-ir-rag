# Method and apparatus for manufacturing truck bodies.

## Abstract
A machine for manufacturing a unitary glass fibre rein forced body shell includes a carriage 52 which is movable along the mold 300 and a turntable 180 which is mounted on a carriage 54 for rotation about a first axis 174 extend ing in the direction of longitudinal movement of the carriage 52 . An arm 210 is slidably mounted on the turntable 180 for radial movement and a dispenser 240 is located on the arm for dispensing glass fibre reinforced resin onto the sur face of the mold 300 . A guidance system 150 is provided which interconnects the turret 130 and the slidable arm 210 and is operable to cause the arm 210 to reciprocate with respect to the turret 130 in a radial direction to main tain a substantially constant length of trajectory extending between the dispener 240 and the wall of the mold. A drive system is provided for rotatably driving the turret 130 about the axis. The carriage 50 is normally stored on a mo bile end cap 10 which may be moved from one mold to another and serves to close one end of the mold. A canopy 80 is mounted with one end connected to the mold 300 and the other end connected to the dispenser carriage 52 such that as the dispenser carriage moves along the mold, the canopy 80 is deployed to cover the open upper end of the mold to form an enclosed chamber from which fumes may be extracted. The method of forming the required body shell includes the steps of dispensing a coating of glass fibre reinforced resin onto the forming surface of a mold 300 while moving the dispenser 240 along successive longitudinally displaced U shaped paths which traverse the forming surface to form a continuous coating covering the top and side forming walls of the mold cavity. The further step of compacting the coating by applying a compactor 250 to the inner surface of the coating and moving the compactor 250 along the same path as that followed by the dispenser 240 at a point located downstream from the dis penser.
