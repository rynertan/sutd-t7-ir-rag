# Improved process for the manufacture of chloroprene.

## Abstract
An improved process for the catalytic dehydrochlorina tion of 3,4 dichlorobutene 1 with aqueous alkali, wherein the effluent from the dehydrochlorination reactor is separated into phases, and the organic phase is steam stripped at low temperature below about 80 C to recover chloroprene product, while the steam stripper heels are returned to the dehydrochlorination reactor. A small portion of the heels is purged prior to being recycled. Most of the catalyst is recovered and returned to the reaction, but a small amount of make up catalyst is added. Chloroprene made in this process is a valuable monomer which finds use in the manufacture of a broad line of synthetic elastomers of considerable industrial interest.
