# Cis C3 ,C4 carbonate derivatives of oleandomycin Y, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and intermediates therefor.

## Abstract
3 Epioleandomycin Y 3 ,4 carbonate, 4 epioleando mycin Y 3 ,4 carbonate, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them are disclosed. The compounds are antibacterial agents. Also disclosed are certain intermediates therefor, being 2 O acyl derivatives of 8 de spirooxiranyl 8 iodomethyl 8 hydroxy 3 ,4 anhydro 3 deoxyoleandomycin Y, 3 ,4 anhydro 3 deoxyoleandomycin Y, 3 epioleandomycin Y, 4 epioleandomycin Y, 3 epioleando mycin Y 3 ,4 carbonate and 4 epioleandomycin Y 3 ,4 carbonate wherein said acyl group has the formula RCO where R is H, C₁ C₅ alkyl, phenyl or benzyl.
