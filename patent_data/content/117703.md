# ANTENNA CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A free standing antenna formed with an elongated tubular body portion, having one or more sections 12, 14, 16 , and an enlarged base portion 19 at its lower end for mounting there of, and the body portion 12 having a plurality of layers or rein forcing filaments, some of the layers being bundles of longitu dinal filament rovings 20 running lengthwise, and others of the layers being generally circumferential windings 22 of filament rovings, the layers being bonded together by resin material. Electrically conductive elements 30 are embedded in the tubular structure, so as to run from end to end, an annular electrically conductive collar 32 is connected to the conduc tive elements 30 adjacent the lower end of the structure 12 , and a female threaded socket 34 is connected to the collar 32 so as to extend through a wall of the tubular structure 12 for connection from the exterior. At least one layer 36 of woven reinforcing filament cloth material extends up the inte rior of the tubular structure adjacent the lower end, and overlies the interior of the collar 32 , with resin bonding the layer 36 of woven cloth material to the interior of the tubular structure 12 , and to the interior of the collar 32 .
