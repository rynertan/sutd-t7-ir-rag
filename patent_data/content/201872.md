# FLUX WEAKENING REGIME OPERATION OF AN INTERIOR PERMANENT MAGNET SYCHRONOUS MOTOR

## Abstract
The operation of an interior permanent magnet synchro nous motor is extended to the constant horsepower regime by causing the stator current vector to follow the voltage limit ellipse in the counter clockwise direction. The error between commanded stator current and actual stator current is determined to signal a saturation of the inverter and the commanded stator current is modified to reduce the error.
