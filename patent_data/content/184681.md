# Brake control valve.

## Abstract
A control valve 10 for a vehicle fluid pressure braking system includes a housing 12 having an inlet port 20 , an outlet port 18 and an exhaust port 16 . A plunger 28 is movable in the housing 12 to control communication be tween the ports 16, 18, 20 . The plunger 28 is provided with a shoulder 40 which carries a seal 64 which engages with a seating area 26 on the housing 12 to provide a seal controlling communication between the aforementioned ports 16, 18, 20 . The seal 64 includes a circumferentially extending cavity 60 on the plunger 28 in which the body a portion 66 of the seal 64 is received. A pair of beads 68, 70 project from the body portion 66 of the seal 64 in opposite axial directions, so that when the seal 64 is moved into engagement with the seating surface 26 , one of the beads 70 sealingly engages the seating surface 26 , and the axial direction forces generated thereby force the bead 68 on the opposite side of the seal 64 into sealing engagement with a sealing surface 72 on the plunger 28 . When the plunger 28 is moved away from the seating surface 26 , thereby abruptly reducing the pressure level around the plunger 28 , high pressure air which is trapped in the groove 58 receiving the body portion 66 of the seal may escape by deflecting the bead 68 away from the sealing surface 72 on the plunger 28 , thereby preventing the high pressure fluid from forcing the seal from the groove.
