# Apparatus for accessing to common resources by several processors in a multiprocessor system.

## Abstract
In a multiprocessor system comprising several proces sors 1 ,2, 3 interconnected, through a common bus 6 , to a memory unit 4 including common resources, which can be used by the several processor apparatus for accessing the common resources which grant access to a common resource by a processor only if such resource is not used by another processor in the meantime. The busy or free status of each resource is indicated in each resource by a lock bit, which is stored in a predeter mined memory position. Such bit is brought to a first logical level by a TEST SET command issued by a processor which interrogates and accesses the resources and to a sec ond logical level by a RESET TEST SET command when the processor release the resource. To avoid that a processor interrogating certain resources with a TEST SET command, and finding them already busy, goes on holding the common bus and stealing mem ory cycles with subsequent periodic requests, untill the resources are released, any RESET TEST SET command is notified to the several processors and latched thereon. Each processor, which has detected busy resources, before trying to access them again, waits for the reception of a RESET TEST SET signal.

## Description
Apparatus for accessing to common resources by several processors in a multiprocessor systemThis invention relates generally to multiprocessor systems and more particularly to an apparatus for accessing to common resources by se veral independent and asynchronous process s connected to form a system.It is known that system architectures are used to increase multiprocessor system preformances.Such architectures consist of several interconnected processing units which may access to common resources, generally memory resources.For instance, some data or tables stored into a memory can be used and modified by several processors which access to such tables in dif ferent time.It is also known that possibleinteferencesare to be avoided when pro cessorsaccess to such common resources and, particularly, it is to be avoided the access of a processor to a common resource when another processor is using and modifying such resource.It is known in fact that the access to common resources by several processors occurs on the basis of resources handling and occupation cycles which are assigned to the requesting processors according to prearranged priorities, and that the handling of a common resource ge nerally requires several handling and occupation cycles of that rescue ce.It is known that, to avoid such interferences a resource locking and unlocking mechanism is used.For instance preliminary to the access to a common resource, read and verify operations are to be effected and a particular locking information, is to be set within the resource.If the information is present any processor which wants to acceed to such resource is prevented from doing it, by the exception of the one who sets it.If the information is not present a processor which wants to access to such memory first of all presets such information preventing the other processors from accessing to the memory.It can thereafter use the resource without other processors interfering with its operation.When the resource utilization is ended the processor removes the locking information allowing the other processors to access the resources just used.The locking information can be supplied in several ways.In the U.S.A. Patent N. 4004485 a multiprocessor system is described where several memory units can be used or contain common resources which can be used by several processors.Each unit is supplied with a flip flop latching the locking information.According to another known embodiment, the locking information can be stored in predetermined memory positions, for instance at the beginning of memory areas which constitute common resources accessible by several processors.In such a way the memory unit is considered as a set of separate conmon resources, each one provided with its own locking mean.In such type of systems, even if the risk of interferences among processors for the access to common resources is avoided, it is however present the inconvenient of an unuseful occupation of the common chan nels used for information transfer in case a processor wants to access to a locked common resourceIn fact, as the locking information is into the common resource, to eiamin such resource it is however required to access it with a read or an interrogation cycle, thus using and occupying a channel connec ting such resource and the unit in which this resource is included.If the locking information is present the processor will continue to periodically interrogate the resource and will periodically continue to occupy the channel connecting such resource and the unit which includes the resource, at detriment of the other processors which could make use of the. same connecting channel or of the same unit which includes the resource whith different purposes than the access to such resource.The problem is more and more serious in the moder multiprocessor systems where a common bus is used for connection.Such inconvenient is avoided by the apparatus obJect of the present invention.According to the invention each system unit, which can access to system common resources through a common. bus, is supplied with latching means for an information having the meaning of removed lock or locking information reset.Such reset information is latched in all the system units everytime anyone of the locking information is reset.If a unit, which wants to access to common resources, checks that such resources are busy, it will not access the interconnection common bus any more and for the following it will not interrogate the common resource but will wait for a reset signal of the locking information.Only when this signal is received then it access the interconnection common bus and checks if the common resource which has been set free is the same to which it wants to access. If it is not the case it waits a new reset signal of the locking information and so on.It is to be noted that owing to such artifice the further advantage is obtained to make the moment in which the units are informed that a common resource is set free simultaneous for the several units which may want to access contemporaneously to common resources.Consequently, if several units want to access to common resources previously busy, their access requests are presented contemporaneouy and the conflicts among units are resolved by granting the access to only one of such units following predetermined priority criterium.These and other characteristics of the invention will appear more clearly from the following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention made with reference to a multiprocessor system which comprises several processors and a common memory unit interconnected through a common bus.The several processors can exchange information with the memory on the basis of common bus access cycles, granted to them in a mutually exclusive way, according to preordered priority criteria.They further can exchange information among themselves through an in terprocessor notify mechanism which signals that the information to be exchanged is stored in common memory resources.The access to and the liberation of such common resource are a speci fic object of such invention.The following description is made with reference to the attached drawings where Figure 1 shows in block form a multiprocessor system architecture with a common bus.Figure 2 shows in block form the logic architecture of each proces sor. Figure 3 shows the conventional symbol used to evidence J K flip Es2 Figure 4 shows the logic diagram of the dialogue unit included in each processor.Figure 5 shows the memory unit of the system with reference to the priority assgnment logic for accessing the bus and the memo ry.Figure 6 shows in timing diagram the dialogue performed on the bus in case of an operation of access to memory and in case of a no tifying command between processors.Figure 7 shows in schematic diagram the organization of common resour ces located in a memory space.Figure 8 is a flow diagram of the operations carried out by a proces sor for storing a message addressed to another processor in common memory resources and for notifying it of such action.Figure 9 is the flow diagram of the operations carried out by a pro cessor, in answer to a notifying signal, for accessing the common memory resources and reading the message intended for it. Figure 1 shows in block diagram the architecture of the multiprocessor system and the bus interconnecting the several units.The system consists of three units or processors 1, 2 and 3 generally N processors and a working memory 4 to which a memory access control ler GAM 5 is coupled.The different units 1, 2, 3 and GAM 5 are interconnected by means of a common bus system comprising a suitable number of leads.The system bus allows for the information transfer from any processor to the working memory and viceversa.The information transfer can be started by any processor in synchro nous way and involves bus occupation for the time required by the tran sfer the function of GAM 5 is to settle the conflicts among several processors which want to occupe the bus at the same time allowing bus access to one processor at a time according to appropriate priority criteria.An information transfer, in fact, can be made between memory and only a processor each time.According to the invention the common bus allows for direct exchange of notifying signals among several processors without involving the memory.Following such exchanges the notified processors can successively resi in the memory the messages intended for them and previously stored in suitable memory zones.In such way the message exchange among processors is possible without the notified processors have to assume a subordinate status as.to the notifying processors.The system bus comprises a group of leads 6 for the transfer of data addresses commands and possibly check bits, such group totally comprising, for instance, 72 leads 4data bytes, 2 address bytes, 1 command byte and 1 check bit for each byte .Such group of leads 6, named DAC BUS, is bidirectional each unit such as 1, 2, 3 and 4 is coupled to DAC BUS by means of interface circuits which can both receive and transmit signals.In the rest condition the transmitting circuits have a virtually infinite output impedance so the TAC BtJS leads are virtually disconnected from the units.In the work condition the transmitting circuits can apply to the leads one of the two electrical levels corresponding to two logical levels o or 1.In the following, unless otherwise specified, the convention will be adopted in which logical level 1 is a high electrical level and logical level 0 is a low or zero electrical level.Such levels can be detected by all receiving units.Logical transmitting circuits of such kind are known as TRISTATI DRI VERBS and are available on the market so that any related additional information is not essential for understanding the present invention a group of leads 7, 8, 9 for the transfer of signals controlling the signals of. dialogue between processors and memory, such signals being respectively named ENCY, PROCOL, MECOL.These leads couple the several units 1, 2, 3 and 4 with an interconnec tion of the type known as open collector as explained later on such type of interconnection requires the interconnection line be con nected to an appropriate voltage source, through a resistor.In each unit the line is connected to a receiver with relatively high inpeiance in at least a unit such line is connected to an open collector transmitter which can connect said line to ground or virtually disconnect it so as to apply to such line an electrical and logical level 0 or 1, respectively.Clearly it suffices that one of the several transmitter connects the line to ground to obtain the electrical logical level 0 on the whole line and to have it detected by the several receivers. a group of leads 11, 121 13 which individually couple each unit 1, 2 and 3 with GAM 5 through an open collector coupling, such leads are used both to send to CAM 5 bus access request signals, named BURE 1, BURE 2 and BURE 3 respectively and to receive from CAM 5 its consent.For the invention purposes it is evidenced that within DAC 3L S 6 there are two leads 6A and 62 used for the transfer of two commands named PROME and SSRES respectively. Such leads allow for the exchange of a noticing signal among several processors.Figure 2 is a block diagram of the architecture of a processor such as units 1, 2 or 3 of Figure 1. The unit comprises two interface registers for the storing of the received information and of information to be transmitted on the bus, namely DAC 13US 6.A register 14 OUT REG is used as output register for data in output to the DAC lUS and register 17 ISgEG is used as input register fcr data in input from DAC BUS. Register 14 outputs are coupled to the inputs of a TRISTATE transmit ter set 18 whose outputs are coupled to DAC BUS.Register 17 inputs are coupled to the DAC 3US through a set of receivers 20.The processor comprises further a control unit 21, an operating unit 22 a wooing register set 23, an interface dialogue unit 24.The control unit 21 sends a control signal to register 14, through lead 15, to enable the register to store information to be transferred to the DAC 3US. It also sends suitable commands to the operating unit, to the working registers and to the interface dialogue unit 24 receiving in turn signals from it. The communication paths are schematically shown as 200 and 201.The interface registers communicate through suitable, not shown, paths with the working registers and the operating unit.Dialogue unit 24 is connected to system PUS leads already shown inFigure 1 with references 7, 8, 9 and 11 or 12 or 13 . In addition, it enables the transmitter set 18, through a signal on lead 77, and the loading of register 17, through a signal on lead 79.Dialogue unite 24 receives further directly from output of receivers 20, some information present on DAC EUS 6, including the ones present on leads 6A and 6B, through bus 78 and leads78 and 783.A detailed description of the architecture of a processor such as the one of Figure 2 is not essential for the invention understanding as such architecture can be made in several ways even very different each other therefore such description is omitted.A more detailed description of embodiment can be found, for instance, in U.S. Patent n. 3,710,324.On the contrary, for the present invention purposes, the architecture of dialogue and priorit unit 24, contained in each processor, as well ascftheworking memory 4 with particular reference to GAM 5, will be considered in detail.Before going on with the description it is suitable to mention the operation of bistable circuits or J K flip flops, owing to their lar ge use in the following of this description.Figure 3 shows the conventional representation diagram generally used for such flip flop which is available on the market since a long time as an integrated circuit. The J K flip flop is a bistable circuit, provided with a timing clock input, with two direct or set reset asynchronous inputs S, R, with two synchronous or clock conditioned inputs J K, and with two outputsQ and Q.A signal applied to S, R inputs activates the flip flop putting it permanently in one of two possible electrical status, while the signals at the J K inputs activate the flip flop only when the trailing edge of a positive electrical logical pulse is applied to input CK.The following table summarizes the flip flop operation. Inputs Outputs S R CK J K Q Q L H X X X H L H L X X X L H L L X X X H H H H L L L Q QQo H H L H L H L Inputs 0utruts S R CK J K Q Q H H L L H L H H H L H H toggle H H H X x Qo In the table t stands for the logical electrical level 0 present at the corresponding input output.H for a logical electrical level 1.X for an indifference condition. Q and Qo stand for the state of Q and Q outputs before the signals o are applied.For instance, it can be seen that both the two inputs S, R must be at logical level 1 to have the flip flop activated by clock pulse CK L .Later on, for sake of clearness, flip flop J K will be evidenced in the several figures as in Figure 3 without reference letters. Always for sake of clarity, the possible leaving out of any indicate on some inputs, particularly J K inputs, will mean that an appropriate electrical signal 1 or 0 , suitable to obtain the desired behaviour, is permanently applied to such inputs.Figure 4 shows, in detail, a preferred embodiment of a dialogue unit 24 contained in each processor 1, 2 or 3 of Figure 1 and particularly referring to processor 1.The unit 24 has the function to enable both the information exchange between processor 1 and the memory and the exchange of aotify signals among processor 1 and any other processor of the system.In addition such unit is able to receive the notify signal from any of the other processors.Unit 24 comprises a J K flipflop 25 BURE which receives at clock input a microcommand MC, coming from control unit 21 Fig. 2 . The inverted output G of flip flop 25 is connected to the input of an open collector inverter driver 31.The output of inverter driver 31 is connected to the system bus lead 11. Lead 11 is connected to a V voltage source through a resistor 30 and it is coupled with CAM 5 at the other end.Flip flop 25 is normally reset it is therefore clear that its inver ted output is at logical level 1 thus lead 11 PURE 1 is normally at logical level 0.When processor 1 requests access to the bus its control unit produces a pulse command MC, in asynchronous way relative to the system operation though inside the processor the event may occur at a predetermi ned instant of its machine cycle .In such way flip flop 25 is set.Lead 11 rises to logical level 1 and signals to GAM 5 that processor 1 wants to access to the bus signal PURE 1 at 1 . With such signal processor 1 does not access to the bus as the bus may be already enga god by other processors or as other processors may present concurrently their access request to the bus.As explained later on the conflict resolution among requesting proces sors is effected by CAM 5.Going on with unit 24 description it will be noted that lead 11 is cou pled, through receiver inverter 34 and NOT 35, to the clock input of a J K flip flop 36 Flip flop ASCY .This is because in the preferred example of embodiment, lead 11 is used for a bidirectional exchange of signals to minimize the number of PUS leads, as described in Italian Patent Application N. 23037 M78 filed by the same assignee on May 5, 1978.As described in such application and reconsidered later on, CAM 5 answers the requesting processors by dropping the PURE signal on lead 11 to logical level 0 when it has decided to allow such processor to ac ces the PUS. This ca ses flip flop 36 ASCY to be set.It is however clear that the answer to the processor could be sent on a separate lead, other than lead 11.Direct output Q of flip flop 36 is connected to 2 first input of a three input circuit hIMID 37, whose output is connected to the clock input of a J E flip flop 38 Flip flop EXCY .Enabling signals, which will be considered later on, are applied to the other two inputs of NAND 37. They enable the signal transfer from output Q of flip flop 36 to the clock input of flip flop 38 only when the PUS is really free.In fact in the described embodiment the cycle assignment operations can overlap the execution and finishing of the possible previous cycle to minimize the information transfer rate on the PUS.Then, when flip flop 36 ASOT is set, once the execution of the pO8 sible previous cycles is completed, flip flop 38 is set and BUS occupa tion and information transfer starts.The Q output of EXCY is connected to the input of delay line 41 having output taps 42, 43, 44.The signal trailing edge at the Q output of EXCY consequent to the setting of EtCY propagates along such line.Output 42 is connected to the input of a NOT 45.Output 43 and the NOT 45 output are connected to the inputs of a two input NAND gate 46.When the delay line is inactive EXCY reset the outputs 43 and 42 are at logic level 1 and NOT 45 output is at logical level 0.Therefore NAND 46 output is normally at logical level 1.When a trailing edge propagates along line 41 output 42 drops to logical level 0 before output 43. Tis NOT 45 output rises to logical level 1 while output 43 is still at logical level 1 and a pulse at logical level 0 appears at 46 output. The NAND gate 46 46 output is connected both to the reset input of flip flop 36 1iCY and to the reset input of flip flop 25 SEE through lead 47.The output 44 of delay line 41 is connected to the clock input of flip flop 49 FROCO . Therefore with the set of flip flop EXCY, flip flop 36 ASCY and flip flop 25 are reset and immediately afterwards flipflop 49 PROCO is set.The direct output Q of flip flop 49 is connected to the input of an open collector izlverter driver 50 whose output is connected to systemPUS lead 8 to apply PROCOL signal thereto.Lead 8 is connected to a V voltage source through a resistor 51, therefore it is normally at logical level 1 but it goes to logical level 0 when flip flop 49 is set.It is to be noted that if PROCOL was previously at logical level 0, say because flip flop 49 wa already set, say because the corresponding flip flop of any other system processor was already set, flipflop 38 EXCY and 49 PROCO set would have been prevented till PF.O COL would have gone to logical level 1. In fact, lead 8 is connected to the input of an inverter receiver 52 whose output is connected to the input of a NOT 53.The output of NOT 53 is connected to the second input of the already considered NAND 37.Therefore the set of flip flop 38 is conditioned inter alia by the presence of a logical level 1 on lead 8 PROCOL . Flip flops 38 EXCY and 49 PROCO are reset as follows.Line 7 ends in each processor with a receiver inverter 59 and with an open collector AND driver 76.Line 7 is normally held at logical level 1 by GAM 5 and by the seve ral processors, this level being dropped to O near the end of a EUS occupation cycle and rising again to 1 at the cycle end.The output of receiver 59 is connected to the input of a delay line 60 having output taps 61, 62.Intermediate tap 61 is connected to a first input of a two inputsOR 64.Tap 62 is connected to the input of a NOT 63, whose output is connected to the second input of OR 64.The output of OR 64 is connected to the reset input of flip flops 38, 49. When delay line 60 is at rest ENCY at logical level 1 its outputs are at logical level 0, and the output of OR 64 is at logical level 1.When ENCY falls to logical level 0 the rising edge at the receiver 59 output propagates from input to outputs of line 60 and brings output 61 to logical level 1 before output 62 goes to 1.OR 64 output remains at logical level 1.On the contrary when ENCY rises back to logical level 1 it is easy to see that a short pulse at logical level 0 appears at OR 64 output.This pulse is suitably delayed relative to ENCY leading edge, and resets flip flops 38 and 49.It is clear that only a processor at a time will have flip flops such as 38, 49 set but ENCY command is clearly forwarded to all the proces sors.Dialogue unit 24 comprises further some flip flops which describe the status of interface registers and store the occurrence of particular events on the interconnection BUS.These are flipdlops 66, 67, 68, 69.When flip flop 66 is set it indicates that output register 14 has been loaded and it is busy, that is contains information to be transferred on the DAC BUS. This status is accessible to control unit 21 through direct output of flip flop 66 which transmiWs control unit 21 an OZ Z signal indica ting that OUT REG is loaded. When flip flop 67 is set it enables the loading of input register 17 with the information present on DAC PUS through lead 79 connected to its direct output.The same lead 79 is used to indicate to the control unit that input register 17 has been loaded.Direct output Q of flip flop 38 EXCY is connected to K input of flip flop 66, to J input of flip flop 67 and to a first input of anAND gate 74 through lead 75.The clock input of flip flop 66 is connected to the output of a NOT 70 whose input is connected to the output of a receiver inverter 71.The clock input of flip flop 67 is directly connected to the output of receiver inverter 71. The input of receiver 71 is connected to lead 9 on which a 3GECOL signal, normally at logical level 1 is received from GAM 5.Lead 9 is held at logical level 1 by a pull up resistor 72.The set input of flip flop 66 and the reset input of flip flop 67 receive the MC microcommand from control unit 21 this is the same micro command which sets flip flop 25 and enables, through lead 15, the loading of register 14.When the processor wants to access to the BUS it arranges the suitable information loading data, commands, addresses in register 14 and at the same time, sets the two flip flops 25 PURE and 6. When the channel is assigned to the requestin g processor flip flop 38 is set the information stored in register 14 is transferred on DAC PUS through TRISTATE 18 circuits enabled by the output of AND 74 circuit lead 77 In fact AND 74 has its two inputs coupled with the direct outputs of the two flip flops 38 and 66 and it enables TS TE 18 circuits with output 77.On DAC PUS the information is therefore present beginning with the lowering of PROCOL signal till memory 4 answers by lowering .ECO signal thus causing the reset of flip flop 66.Likewise flip flop 67, when reset, causes the loading of register 17 through a signal at level 1 on its direct output connected to lead 79 and indicates that to the control unit.In fact flip flop 67 is set by the rising edge of MECOL signal which occurs when Memory 4 has put on DEC BUS the data to be loaded into register 17. 1 ECO signal is produced by memory circuit block when the information transfer requires a read or write operation of the memory and there fore involves one of the processors and the memory.On the contrary, as it will be shown later on, in case of communication among processors, memory is not involved in the information tran sfer and f OL signal is not produced.It is therefore necessary to arrange a second reset circuit for flipflop 66 considering such possbility. Likewise ENCY signal is normally produced by the memory.In case of communication among processors the memory does not produce any ENCY signal and this one must be produced by the notified processor.Therefore an ENCY signal generation circuit and a second reset circuit for flip flop 66 must be provided in each processor.Such considerations lead to a more detailed description of the proces sor notifying or communication mechanism.When a processor wants to notify information to another processor it previously stores into memory the message to be transferred, using the normal transferring mechanism from processor to memory. Later on such aspect will be considered in detail.Then the processor loads into register 14 a code corresponding to the notified processor name and a control PP.Os E bit at logical level 0 in dicating that the required transfer does not involve the memory.Once the access to DBEWIS has been obtained, such information is available to all the processors connected to the BUS through receiving circuit without register interposition.In each processor a name generator device is arranged.Such device can ba a register or a key set which can be manually prearranged and which allow to apply to a suitable number of leads electrical levels 1 or 0 corresponding to the name of each processor.The code on the BUS is compared, in a comparison network, available in each processor, with the processor name determined by the name ge nerator.For that processor and only for that one, for which its name and the code on the BUS coincide, the comparison network emits a positive comparison signal which, conditioned by the presence of PROME signal at logic level 0, sets a notifying flip flop and causes the generation of the signal ENCY of cycle end. Figure 4 shows that the dialegue logic comprises a group of keys 82 and a comparator circuit 73. The output of the key set is connected to a first input set of a comparator 73 which receives at a second input set, connected to channel 78 through a set 20 of receivers invert ens, the name of the notified processor present on the DAC PUS. The output of comparator 73 is coupled with an input of a two inputAND 81. The second input of AND 81 is connected to lead 78S which receives through a receiver inverter of set 20 the PROIzE signal.When PROME is at logical level 0 and the comparison between the notified name and the processor name matches, the output of AND 81, con nected to the J input of flip flop 68, applies to such input a logical level 1.The set of flip flop 68 is obtained by means of a signal derived fromPROCOL.The output of NOT 53 is coupled with the input of a delay line 83 having a plurality of taps 84, 85.First tap 84 is connected to the input of an inverter 86.The inverter output is connected to an input of a two input NANS, 87.Second tap 85 of the delay line is directly connected to the second input of NAND 87.The set including dealy line 83, NOII 86 and NAND 87 forms a pulse ge nerator. It is easy to see that when a PROCOL signal on lead 8 drops to logical level O a short pulse at logicel evel 0 appears at the output of NANS 87 with a certain delay due to line 83 characteristics.The output of NAND 87 is connected through lead 92, to the clock input of flip flop 68 and set it if the logidLlevel at J input is 1.This occurs to the notified processor PRo at logigl.level 0 and mat ched comparison between notifying code or name and processor name .The output of NAND 87 is further connected, through lead 93 to the input of a NOT 91 whose output is connected to an input of an open collector NAND 76.The output of AND 81 is connected, through lead 94, to a second input of NAND 76. AS already said, NAND 76 output is colmected to lead 7.Therefore, through elements 91 and 76, a notified processor generates a short pulse ENCY at logical level 0 on lead 7 normally held at logical level 1 by a pull up resistor 54.Such pulse reaches all the processors through lead 7.The notifying processor which started the transfer cycle of the notify message receives the pulse through its receiver 59 and resets its flip flops 38 XCY and 49 PROCO . It is to be noted that the output of OR 64 is connected both to the reset input of flip flops 38 and 49 and, through lead 45 and circuitOR 82, to the reset input of flip flop 66.Circuit OR 82 has a second input connected to a IXOT 80 output, whose input in its turn is connected to lead 78A, and a third input connected, through lead 39 to the output 44 of delay line 41.Therefore, when PROBE signal is at logical level 0, the second input ofOR gate 82 is at loghl level 0, the third input of OR gate 82 is at logical level 0 in the notifying processor and the pulse at logiml le vel 0 coming from OR 64 output is transferred to the output of OR ga te 82 and resets flip flop 66.When PROME signal is at logical level 1 the output of NOT 80, at logical level 1, masks the reset pulse applied to flip flop 66 throughOR 82.Indipendently from PROME signal level, output 44 of the delay line 41 masks the reset pulse applied to flip flop 66 in all the processors which did not have access to the PUS during the outstanding cycle.To complete the description of dialogue unit 24, some of its circuits will be mentioned, though they are not directly involved in the infor mation transfer process between processors and memory or in the notification among processors.The circuits in question are two flip flops 69, 88 and some logicalele ments coupled to them.Flip flop 88 5ERE has its clock input connected to the output ofNOT 53 through which it receives PROCOL signal.The K input of flip flop 88 is connected, through lead 783, to the output of a receiver inverterof a group 20 and receives through it a S S signal present on lead 6B.The J input of flip flop 88 is connected to lead 78B through NOT 89. Therefore, if SERVES signal on lead 6B is at log 1evel 1, flip flop 8d is set or maintained in set by the trailing edge of PROCOL signal, while it is reset or maintained in reset if SURFS signal is at logical level 0The direct output Q of flip flop 88 is connected to the J input of flip flop 69.Clock input of flip flop 69 is connected, through lead 90, to the out put of OR gate 64.Therefore, with the reset of flip flop 38, 44, flip flop 69 T is set too if during the same cycle flip flop 88 has been set.Flip flop 69 is reset by a microcommand MP. The function of flip flop 69 will be considered later on.Having described in detail the dialogue handling unit of the several processors it is now useful to describe the system memory unit 4 with particular reference to GAN 5 of such unit. Figure 5 shows such unit.Lead 11 is connected to the input of a receiver inverter circuit 131, lead 12 is connected to the input of a receiver inverter circuit 132 and likewise lead 13 is connected to the input of a receiver inverter circuit 133. The outputs of receivers 131, 132 and 133 are connected, on one side, to corresponding inputs of a NE 133 and, besides, to data inputs D1,D2, D3 of a register 134 respectively.The output of NAND 135 is connected to one input of a two input AND 136. AND 136 receives at its second input, through lead 137, an enabling signal from output Q of a J K flip flop 138.The output of AND gate 136 is connected to a multitapped delay line 139 and to the clock input of register 134, through lead 140.A first output tap of delay line 139 is connected to the input of an inverter or NOT 141 element, whose output is connected to the direct S input of J K flip flop 135. A second output tap of delay line 139 is connected to the input of 2 NOT 142 whose output is connected to Ihe direct wi input of a J K flip flop 143.The direct output Q of flip flop 143 is connected, through lead 144, to the enabling input of three inverter driver NAND gates 145, 146 and 147.The output of such inverters drivers 145, 146 and 147 are connected to leads 11, 12, 13 respectively.The signal input of the three inverter drivers 145, 146, 147 is connected to three outputs Ul, U2, U3 respectively of an exclusion logic matrix or priority network 148.Outputs 01, 02, 03 of register 134 form the inputs of priority network 148.In Figure 5 the priority network comprises three NOT 149, 150, 151 ard two AND 152, 153 with three and two inputs respectively.Output 01 of register 134 is connected, through inverter 151, to output U1 of network 148 and it is applied to the signal input of inverter driver 145.Output 01 is further connected to a first input of the two AND gates 152 and 153.Output 02 of register 134 is connected, through inverter 150, to a se cond input of AND 153 whose output U2 is connected to the signal input of inverter driver 146.Output 02 is further connected to a second input of AND gate 152.At last, output 03 of register 134 is connected, through inverter 149, to a third input of AND gate 152 whose output U3 is connected to the signal input of inverter driver 147.The function of the exclusion logic matrix or priority network 148 is to assign a relative priority to the access requests to DAC PUS recei ved from the several processors through lezÅas 11, 12, 13 ar.d to enable the output from the network of the request with i gter priority in case of several simultaneous requests.The shown priority network assigns, for instance, highest priority to access requests coming from processor I through lead 11, intermeq diate priority to access requests coming from processor 2, through lead 12 and lowest priority to requests coming from processor 32 through lead 13.It can be noted that a signal at logical level 0 on terminal tap 01 is transferred to output U11 where owing to NOT 151 it appears in inverted form say as a signal at logical level 1 without any conditio ning.On the contrary a signal at logicilevel 0 present on terminal 02 is transferred to output U2 only if a signal at logical level 1 is present at the same time on terminal 01 which indicates that an access request with higher priority is not present.Likewise a signal at logical level 0 present on terminal 03 is transfer red to output U3 only is a signal at logical level 1 is present at the same time on both terminals 02 and 01.Taps 01, 02, 03 represent the outputs of the register 134 cells corresponding respectively to inputs, D1, D2, D3 and devoted to store access requests received on leads 11, 12, 13 respectively as infornatxn at logical level 0.The operation of memory interface circuits hitherto described is there fore clear.When a processor, for instance processor 2, wants to access the memc y, it rises the signal present on lead 12 to logical level 1.Therefore the output of receiver inverter 132 falls to logical level 0, and the output of NAND gate 135 rises to logical level 1.If AND gate 136 is enabled because J K flip flop 138 is reset as it will be seen later on, this means that memory cycles are not already in progress logical level 1 is transferred to the output of D ele ment 136 and it activates the loading of register 134 through lead 14Q Logical level 0 present at the output of NAND 132 is loaded into the register together with the logical level present at the output of the other NAND 131 and 133.At the same time the logical lev el 1 present at the output of NAKD 136 is applied to the delay line 139 and propagates along it.When logical level 1 reaches the first tap, the output of NOT 141 falls to logical level 0 and J K flip flop 138 is set.Thus output Q of flip flop 138 falls to logical level 0 and this has the effect of disabling AND gate 136.Therefore possible following access requests are not transferred to the output of AND gate 136 and are not taken in account until flipflop 138 is reset again.When logical level 1, which propagates along delay line 139, reaches the second output tap, flip flop 143 is set too, through NOT 142.Thus, direct output Q of such flip flop rises to logical level 1 enabling AND DRIEER circuits 145, 146, 147.The access request with higher priority among the possible ones previously stored by register 134, if that is the case, has been in the meantime presented to the output of priority network 148 as logical level 1.Supposing that a logical level 1 is present, at output U2, the output of open collector NAiNt DRIVER 146 falls to logical level 0.Therefore logical level 1 present on lead 12 is forced to O as answer and acceptance of the access request.At this point it is to be born in mind that flip flops 138 and 143 are set, that is they have not been put in the initial reset status.However when the processor whose request has been accepted receives the acceptance response, it lowers signal PRGCOL on lead 8 at logical level 0, thus indicating that it really accesses the memory.Logical level 0 present on lead 8 is received by the memory through receiver inverter 154 whose output rises to logical level 1.The output of receiver inverter 154 is onnected, through lead t55 and ALND gate 174, to an input 156 of a memory control logic block 157 and activates it if AND gate 174 is enabled.This block is not shown in detail because it is not essential for un derstanding the invention.Block 157 also receives, through DAC PUS 6, information representative of commands for instance, write read, diagnostic test , of memory addresses and of data to be written in the memory. The DAC 3US, which is bidirectional, will be also used for sending back to the requesting processor, memory state signals and readout data.The DAC PUS is connected, through a receiver inverter set 101 to the inputs of an input register group 102 1 REG . Lead 6A of DC BUS is further connected, through a receiver inverter 175, a NOT 166 and a lead 167, to an enabling disabling input of AND gate 164. Lead 6h transfers the PROME command from the processor which accessed the DAC 13US to the memory.If PRORE is at. logical level 1, gate 164 is enabled and the signal pre sent on lead 155 is transferred to memory block 157 activating it.If PROME is at logical level 0, any activation of the memory block does not occur.Another group of output registers 103 O FEG of logic block 157 has its outputs connected to the inputs of a TRISTME N AND DRIVER group 104 whose outputs are connected to DAC 3US 6.As soon as logical block 157 receives the signal at logical level 1 nn lead 155, it enables the loading of registers 1ç2 and starts the me mory operations defined by se content of such registers.At the same time logical block 157 produces on output lead 105 a level 1, indicating the beginning of a memory cycle.Lead 105 is connected to the input of an inverter driver 106 whose output is connected to PUS lead 9.Therefore, on such lead, signal DIECOL falls to logical level 0 and informs the processor to which access to the bus has been granted that the memory cycle has started and that the information present on DACPUS can be removed.In fact, as already seen with reference to figure 4, signal MECOL atO causes the reset of flip flop 66 and the disabling of driver group 18 Fig. 2 .When the requested operation is completed and, for instance, in case of data read operation, the data are loaded together with other useful information into the register group 103 O REG , logic block 157 enables the driver group 104 to transfer such data and information on DBC BUS and at the same time it lowers again to 0 the signal present on lead 105.Signal btECOL on PUS lead 9 rises again to 1.As already seen, this causes the set of flip flop 67 Figure 4 of the processor to which the cycle has been granted and enable the loat ding of the information present on DAC I3US into register group 17 Figure 2 .The output of receiver inverter 154 is further connected, through inverter 160 to the clock input of flip flop 143.Therefore as soon as PROCOL falls to logical level 0, the output of in verter 160 falls to logical level 0 and flip flop 143 is reset.Consequently the logical level at direct output Q of such fliHflop falls to 0 and NAND DRIVERS 145, 146, 147 are disabled so their outputs are disconnected from ground and resume again the normal reset state. It is to be recalled that elements tis5, 145, 147 are of tne open collector type .At the end of the memory cycle, or preferably some time before, for the reason which will be stated later on, the memory control logic block 157 produces on output lead 161 a cycle end signal at logical vel 1.The signal is applied, through lead 162 and the inverter 163, to the clock input of flip flop 138 and resets it, thus enabling the transfer of new or still pending access requests through AND circuit 136.Signal on lead 161 is further sent through lead 164 to the input of inarerter driver 165 whose output is connected to BUS lead 7.Then signal ENCY on lead 7 falls to logical level 0 and signals to the several processors that the memory cycle in progress is ending.Signal ENCY is held at logical level 0 untill the end of the memory cycle, that is, it rises to 1 when the memory is ready to begin a new cycle.As already described, the reset of flip flop 38, 49 of the dialogue unit in the processor to which the cycle has been assigned occurs withENCY rising again to logical level 1.The previous description shows the operation of the memory circuits and of GÂ J. 5 in case a processor requires an information transfer feai write involving the memory.In this case signal PRONE at logical level 1 will be present among the processor commands sent on the DAC PUS. The operation of GAN 5 is the same in case a processor wants to send a notifying signal to another processor.Even in this case the PUS will be assigned by GAM 5 to the notifying processor following the already seen priority criterium.However, in such case, the signal PROME at logical level 0 is present among the signals sent by the processor through the DAC BUS. Consequently no memory cycle is activated and no generation of signals ECOL and ENCY at logical level 0 occurs from the memory,Instead, as already seen, signal ENCY is produced by the notified pro cessor and the reset function of signal ECO on flip flop 66 is, in this case, obtained from the combined effect of signal ENCY and signalPROME at logical level 0.It is now useful, for a better understanding of the invention, to reconsider as a whole the operation of the infonnation transfer mechanism among the several processors and the memory and the notifying me chanism from a processor to another one.Such description is made with reference to the timing diagram of figure 6.Diagram PURE 1 shows the logical level present on lead 11 at the output of processor 1.Diagram PROCOL shows the logical level present on lead 8. Diagram ENCY shows the logical level present on lead 7.Diagram MECOL shows the logical level present on lead 9.Diagram OUT EN 1 shows the logical level present at the output of AND gate 74 of processor 1 dialogue unit.Diagram DAC PUS shows the DAC BJS state.Diagram PROME shows the state of lead 6A of the DAC BUS. Diagram DR 1 shows the logical level present at the output of flipflop 67 ti g 4 of processor 1.Diagram NOTIFY shows the logical level present at the output of flipflop 68 of a notified processor.The chaining arrows from edge to edge of the various diagrams show the chaining of the events.The case of processor processor 1 which wants to read data in working memory 4 is considered at first. At an initial time t0 processor 1 produces an access request register 14 Figure 2 is loaded and flip flops25 and 66 are set. PURE 1 rises at logical level 1 and spreads along line 11.when BURE 1 is received by GS 5 it activates, through logical gates 131, 135, 136, the loading of register 134, the delay line 139, the set of flip flop 138 and finally the set of flip flop 143 which enables the several outputs of logical gates 145, 146, 147.In case of access requests sent at the same time by several processors, register 134 would contain such different access requests.Priority network 148 recognizes the highest priority access request that is PURE 1 .Therefore the output of inverter driver 145 is grounded and PURE 1 falls to logical level 0.This level 0 spreads along lead 11 and at time t it is received by 3 processor 1, informing such processor that its request is accepted.The fall of PURE 1 to logical level 0, detected by receiver 34, sets flip flop 36 activating the PUS occupation.First flip flop 38 is set, then flip flops 25, 36 are reset and flipflop 49 is set.At a time t4 OUT EN 1 rises to logical level 1 allowing the transfer of information from register 14 onto DASZJS time t . 5Logical level 1 of DAC PUS diagram shows that meaningful information is present of the DAC PUS. Such information may comprise, for instan ce, a memory address and suitable commands among which a read command and a signal PROME at logical level 0 on lead 6A.For better clearness sake the logical level of such signal is separately evidenced as Diagram PROME.With flip flop 49 set, PROCOL falls to logical level 0 time t6 .When GAM 5 receives signal PROCOL at logical level 0, it reset flipflop 143 and, as signal PROME is at logical level 1 and AND gate 164 is enabled it loads register 102 with the information present on DAC 3LS an lowers to logical level C signal COL time t , starting 9 a memory cycle or more generally operations specified by the received information .When processor 1 receives DECAL at logical level 0, flip flop 66 is reset and signal OUT EN 1 time t falls to logical level 0 remo 10 ving the information from DAC BUS time t . 11 In the other processors kECOL produces no effects.Nearabout the memory cycle end, CDI 5 lowers to logical level 0 signal ENCY time t . 12At the same time it resets flip flop 138 Figure 5 and allows the re cognition of pending access requests and the loading of register 134.Such operation occurs before the memory cycle is ended, so that the propagation time of signals in the priority network and associated circuits, and then along leads 11, 12, 13 up to the processors, overlaps the cycle already in progress, so that the selected processor be already prepared to access the BUS without delay since the beginning of the new cycle.Nearabout the memory cycle end, GAM 5 raises again to logical level 1 signal MECOL time t and at the same time it allows the transfer 14 of the information contained into register 103 for instance data read out from memory on the DAC PUS. In processor 1 the new rising of MECOL to logical level 1 causes the set of flip flop 67 with consequent loading of the information present on DAC PUS into register 17.At the memory cycle end GAM 5 raises again ENCY to logical level 1 time t15 and rids DAC PUS of present information.As soon as processor 1 receives the rising edge of ENCY flip flops 38 and 39 are reset and PROCOL rises again to logical level 1 time t16 16 The ENCY rising has effects neither on the other processors nor on flip flop 66 which is already reset.The described dialogue is also use for memory write operations.In such case, besides the memory address, PROME command and write com mand, also the data to be written will be put on DS BUS. The only difference is that in such case the memory does not necessa rily put on DAC PUS a response information at the cycle eri though flip flop 67 is however set.The case of a processor for instance 1 which wants to notify another processor for instance 2 is now considered.In this case too processor 1 produces, at an initial time to an access request to the PUS register 14 Figure 2 is loaded with the suit2 ble information that is processor 2 name and command PROME at suitable logical leveland flip flops 25 and 26 are set.PURE 1 rises to logical level 1 and spreads along line 11. When PURE 1 is received by ZM 5, it activates, through logical elements 131, 135, 136, the loading of register 14, the delay line 139, the set of flipflop 138 and finally the set of flip flop 143 which enables the several outputs of logical elements 145, 146, 147. In case of more access requests present at the same time, register 134 would contain these several access requests.Priority network 148 recognizes the access request with highest priority that is PURE 1 .Therefore the output of inverter driver 145 is grounded and PURE 1 falls to logical level 0.This level 0 spreads along line 11 and at time t18 is received by processor 1 and notifies that its request is accepted.The fall of PURE 1 to logical level 0, detected by receiver 34, set flip flop 36 and activates the BUS occupation.First flip flop 38 is set then flip flop 25 and 36 are reset and flip flop 49 PROCO is set. At a time t CUT iT 1 rises to logical level 1 allowing the informa 19 tion transfer from register 14 to DAC 3US time t19 . 19Logical level 1 of tAC3US indicates that some meaningful binary in format ion is present on DAC BUS.Essentially in this case such information consists in the name of the notified processor processor 2 and in signal PEZOMF at logical level 0 on lead 6A Diagram PROME With the set of flip flop 49, PROCOL falls to logical level 0 time t20 .When GAM 5 receives signal PROCOL at logical level 0 it resets flipflop 143.On the contrary no memory cycle starts because signal PROME at logical level 0 inhibits AND gate 164 Figure 5 .So GAM 5 has completed its own job.The name of notified processor present on DAC BUS is recognized by the comparator circuit of processor 2 corresponding to 73 of Figure 4 , so that a logical level 1 is applied to J input of flip flop NOTI, corresponding to 68 in processor 2, through AND gate corresponding to 81 in processor 2 and enabled by PROIC at logical level 0.Signal PROCOL at logical level 0 is received by all the processors, processor 2 included, and in this last one it sets flip flop NOTI diagram NOTIFP, , time t21 . In this last one it also causes the grounding for a short time of interface lead 7.Therefore ENCY falls to logical level 0 for said time interval t22 22 t23 . With the new rising of ENCY to logical level 1, which is detected by all the processors, processor 1 included, signal OLJT EN 1 t24 is re 24 moved on processor 1 and therefore the meaningful signals are removed from DAC PUS t26 . 26 In addition, always in processor 1, flip flop 66 and flip flop PROCO are reset. PROCOL rises again to logical level 1 t25 . 25 At the end of this WTS occupation cycle, which is completed in a shaft time interval because the activation of a memory cycle is not requested, the notified processor is in a notify state with its flipgflop NOTI set.From now on processor 2 will be able, during its operation and following its own appropriate criteria, to consider the received notify signal at the most suitable time t27 and to reset flip flop NOTI 27 Wime ime t28 Once considered how the dialogue on the system BUS is effected, both in case of information transfer from a processor to a working memory and in case of notifying signal transfer among processors, it is now useful to consider how the intercommunication among processors is obtained.In fact the intercommunication among processor requires, to be effective, that messages with suitable information content can be exchanged among processors.The exchange of a notifying signal is not enough.To this purpose, as shown in Figure 7, the addressable memory space, for example of 64E memory positons each one with a suitable parallelism, for instance 16 or 32 bits plus possible parity control bits , comprises memory zones dedicated to each processor located to start from memory fixed addresses.For instance memory 4 comprises a zone with addresses starting from 16 dedicated to processor 1 and named PRT1, a zone with addresses starting from 32 dedicated to processor 2 and named PRT2, a zone dedi cated to processor 3 and named PRT3.The information contained in each table is, indicatively, the following 10 table word it includes a bit L the eighth in Figure 7 with func tion of access control to the tableSuch bit, if at logical level 1, indicates that a processor is reading and updating the table and that the other processors cannot have access to the same table.Bit L is raised to logical level 1 by the processor which access the table and is lowered to logical level 0 by the same processor.Other bits can be used as control and error correction bits.20 table word it contains status indicator bits. For instance a bit can indicate, when at logical level 1, that a program or a service which must be executed by the notified processor has been queued or arranged in a queue.Another bit can indicate that at least one of the peripherals coupled with a processor has pending a disconnect request.30 table word it contains a QpED E SIZING POINTER of pending pro gramslsenrices, that is the memory position where it is stored the beginning address of the first program or service which must be executed by the processor which the table is dedicated to.40 table word it contains a QUEUE ENDING POINTER of pending pro grams services that is the position memory address immediately following to the one where the last word is stored of the last program ser vice intended for the processor which the table is dedicated to. Other table words may contain other queue pointers, for instance an executed service queue, a queue of services to be cancelled, and o r . The STARTING POINTER and the EUE ENDING POINTER of each pro cessor table, PRTi define as many memory zones Q EuEi, of variable length, which contains, in an orderly seauence or by indirect referen ce from a service to the other, all the programs services intendedior a processor.It is in processor RLi table and in ZJGi that the messages intended for the several processors are completely stored. Fig. 8 shows in flow chart the operations that a processor i executes for storing into memory a message intended for a processor J and consisting for instance in the command to begin a program and to send a notifying signal to it. Starting from an initial condition where a notify operation indica ted with is needed, processor i activates a microprogram which runs as follows.First of all. a TEST SET T command is sent to the memory by an access memory operation which involves the already seen procedure.PRONE signal on the interface will be at logical level 1.T command is accompained on the PUS by the address of first FRTj word processor table the access to which is required and it requests the combined operation of reading the first PPSj word and of rewritting the same word raising locking bit L to logical level 1 if it already was not.Therefore at the beginning of the dialogue a bit L 1 is put as data to be written on DAC PUS. At the memory cycle end, at about the end of the dialogue, the memory put on DAG PUS the information read out and previously contained into the first PRI j word.Such information is examined by processor 1.If bit L is at 0, that means that PRTj was not occuped and that proces sor i has taken access to it, it can therefore go on with its dialo gue with the memory reading the second P2Tj word.The information therein included is examined by processor i and if ne cessary up dated with a new message.If at least a program is present in gUEj, processor i reads the fourth PRTj word obtaining the address of qJEUEj end.At this point it can, by means of subsequent write operations beginning from the received address, add to memory QUEUEj the program instruction for processor j. The last address used, increased by 1, is then wriw ten on the fourth PRTj word.Thus the queue end address is updated. All these operations accur with a dialogue between processor and memory, PRODIE signal is therefore at logical level 1.At this point a signal NOTIFY is sent to processor j putting on DACBUS the name of processor j, NOTIFY signal, at logical level 1 andPROME signal at logical level 0.Flip flop 68 in processor j is therefore set.As microprogram ends, processor i sends a RESET T command to memory.Owing to such command first PRTj word is addressed and bit L is lowered to logical level 0, so leaving PRTj and WEUEj resources free to be used by the other processors.Such command is evidently accompained by PROhIE signal at logical level 1. Such command is further accompained by a SIRES signal at logical level 1.This signal, besides the memory, is received by all the processors con nected to the PUS and, during the dialogue on the BUS, with the fall of PROCOL to logical lovel 0, it sets the flip flop corresponding to 88 of figure 1 in all the processors.At the end of BUS occupation cycle, with ENCY raising again to logical level 1, in all the processors the flip flop T corresponding to 69 of Figure 1 is therefore set.This signals to all the processors that at least some resources prelim sly occuped has been set free.The importance of such artifice is clear.In fact, if a processor i, which wants to access the resources dedica ted to processor j PETj into memory, with a TEST SET operation finds the resources occuped, it must generally try again to access such resources repeating the T command untill it finds that such re sources are free.Each T operation involves a memory access and therefore a PUS occu pat ion which is competitive and prejudicial to the PUS utilization by the other processors.This is avoided by means of the described artifice.Considering again the flow chart of figure 8, it can be seen that, after a first T operation, processor i examines the logical level of bit L.If L 1 no further access attempts are made, but processor i examines the state of its T flip flop.Evidently such operation does not involve the PUS occupation but this one occurs inside the processor.If T is reset tzar O the processor goes on cyclically testing the state path A .If T is set, which occurs when some common resources that is any of the processor table FRT is set free by any one of the processors, flip flop T is set.At this point processor i executes a T operation again path B resetting with microcommand NP its flip flop T . If the resources set free are the ones to which processor i wants to access, the notifying process can be concluded.If the resources set free are not the one to which processor i wants to access L 1 processor i will start again examining the state of its flip flop T8ER untill this one is set again.In this case the operation cycle goes on untill the requested resources are effectively available and involves a reduced number of memory occupation cycles.Once described in the whole the notifying operation among processors and the apparatus which performs it, it is possible to complete such description showing how the notified processor answers to the notify ing signal. Figure 9 shows in flow chart the operations performed by the notified processor.At the beginning of each microprogram to be executed, indicated with first of all each processor examines the state of flip flop NOTLIf NOTI is reset NOTIFY 0 the microprogram must be normally executed path C .If NOTIFY 1 the microprogram jumps to a routin of the notifying signal treatment.Such routine involves 10 a T operation of the memory to the fixed beginning address of the PEE table dedicated to processor j. 2 bit L examination.If L O processor j accesses to the Pçj resources and reads the types of messages addressed to it and defined by the second PRTj word, it decides, on appropriate criterium basis, which type of message have to consider firstly and consequently, it completes the requested information finding entering a queue, for instance QUELJEj. Then it begins the treatment of the received messages up dating or pt ting at zero the teginning end queue pointers and the message type pointers of 20 PRT word. All these operations, which can change from processor to processor and from message to message, are schematized with the TREAT ME SSA S operating block.Finally, if no messages to be trated are still in the dedicated resour ces, it resets its flip flop NOTI by a microcommand MB and by a reset command set its dedicates resources free starting again the execution of the initial microprogram or starting the execution of the programs services it was required to begin.3 If instead L 1 processor j begins to examine the state of its flip flop TE path D untill this one is set T R 1 .At this point processor j tries again an access operation to the dedi cated resources and so on untill the access is obtained.
