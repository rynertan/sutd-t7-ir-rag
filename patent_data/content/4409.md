## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING 1,7 OCTADIENE The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing 1,7 octadiene by hydrodimerizing butadiene in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a tertiary phosphine, formic acid, a base and optionally a solvent. Linear dimerization of butadiene 1,3 butadiene provides a source of C8 unsaturated hydrocarbon intermediates useful for the synthesis of diacids, diesters, diols or diamines. A particularly preferred dimer is 1,7octadiene which has terminal double bonds and allows the production of product having only terminal functional groups. U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,732,328 discloses the preparation of mixtures of octadienes, primarily 1,6octadiene, by reacting butadiene in the presence of a palladium compound, a polar sblvent, a reducing agent and a tertiary phosphine. Trialkyl, mixed alkylaryl or triaryl phosphines are mentioned as useful, specifically noting triphenyl phosphines. U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,823,199 also discloses the preparation of mixtures of octadienes, primarily 1,6octadiene, by reacting butadienes in the presence of palladium metal or a palladium compound, a non polar solvent, a reducing agent and a tertiary phosphine. Tricycloalkyl phosphines are stated as being useful but stated to be equivalent to trialkyl phosphines. U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,341,324 also discloses processes similar to above but uses amine solvents. Tetrahedron Letters No. 2, pp. 163 164 discloses the production of mixtures of octadienes primarily by reacting butadiene in the presence of palladium salts, an organic base, formic acid and a phosphine. No particular phosphine was noted as selectively producing 1,7 octadiene. Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 55 1973 405 407 discloses the use of a triphenyl phosphine zero valent palladium complex catalyst in benzene in the presence of formic acid to dimerize butadiene.Although a 7596 butadiene conversion is reported, only 22 of the product was 1,7octadiene. No phosphine other than the triphenyl phosphine was mentioned. The Applicants have now surprisingly found that high selectivities to 1,7 octadiene are obtained if in the hydrodimerization of 1,3 butadiene, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a tertiary phosphine, formic acid, a base and optionally a solvent, the tertiary phosphine used has the formula R1R2R3P wherein R1 is benzyl or branched alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl having from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms with branching occurring at a carbon atom no more than two carbon atoms removed from the phosphorus atom and R2 and R3 are R1 or independently alkyl, alkenyl or aryl having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. The use of the tertiary phosphine of this invention provides much higher selectivities to 1,7 octadiene than do the phosphines utilized in the prior art. Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with a process for preparing 1,7 octadiene by hydrodimerizing butadiene in the presence of a catalytic amount of palladium, a tertiary phosphine, formic acid, a basa and optionally a solvent,characterized in that the tertiary phosphine has the formula ThR2R3P wherein R1 is a benzyl group or an optionally unsaturated branched alkyl including alkenyl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl group having from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms with branching occurring at a carbon atom no more than two carbon atoms from the phosphorus atom and R2 and R3 are R1 or independently optionally unsaturated alkyl including alkenyl or aryl groups having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. Solvents are not essential to the process of this invention, but a good organic solvent can promote the rate of reaction by a factor of two or more. The non polar solvents disclosed in U.S. PatentSpecification No. 3,823,199 such as paraffinic, cycloparaffinic or aromatic which are useful in the process of this invention. The solvent can be a paraffin or cycloparaffin containing 5 to 16 carboy atoms, such as hexane, dodecane, pentadecane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and the like. Suitable solvents also include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, lower alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, m , p and o xylene, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons including chloro, bromo and iodo substituted, such as chloro benzene and the like. Halogenated lower aliphatic compounds such as chloroform, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride and the like may be used, in particular chloroform is preferred. Further useful solvents are the amine solvents disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 1,341,324. A wide range of amines are useful provided that they are liquid under reaction conditions. Tertiary aminee are preferred to primary and secondary amines. Suitable amine solvents include alkylamines, cycloalkylamines, arylamines and heterocyclic amines such as morpholine, pyridine, piperazine and piperidine. Examples of these classes of amines are the lower alkylamines containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group such as triethylamine mono cyclohexylamine, and N alkyl cyclo hexylamines containing up to 12 carbon atoms aniline and N alkylanilines containing up to 12 carbon atoms and N alkylmorpholines containing up to 12 carbon atoms. The preferred amine solvent is pyridine. Further useful solvents are those of moderate coordinating ability, and which include nitriles such as lower alkyl nitriles, hydrocarbon aromatic nitriles including acetonitrile, benzonitrile and the like, amides including benzamide, acetamide, mono and di substituted amides where the substituent is preferably lower alkyl.Suitable substituted amides include N methyl acetamide, N,N dimethyl acetamide and dimethylformamide. Dialkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide and sulfones such as sulfolane and alkyl substituted sulfolane are satisfactory.Simple ethers such as the Lower alkyl ethers including dimethyl ether, diethylether, and the like function satisfactorily. Hydrocarbon aromatic ethers such as the lower alkyl phenyl ethers may also be used, and include methyl phenyl ether anisole , ethyl phenyl ether phenetole and the like. Cyclic, saturated hydrocarbon ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran and the like are also suitable solvents. Lower alkyl diethers such as dimethoxy ethane, and the like may be used. In addition, the cyclic diethers such as 1,4 dioxane are also suitable as solvents. Simple lower alkyl esters of lower alkanoic acids such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, methyl butyrate, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate and the like are also suitable solvents of moderate coordinating ability. Ketones, including lower aliphatic ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and hydrocarbon aromatic ketones such as acetophenone are also satisfactory solvents. Lower mono and di alkanols such as isopropanol, ethylene glycol and the like may be used if desired. The preferred solvents of moderate coordinating ability include nitriles, formamides, such as dimethylformamide, diWower alkyl ethers, lower alkyl phenyl ethers, simple lower alkyl esters of lower alkanoic acids, ketones and lower alkanols. Particularly useful solvents utilized in this invention include pyridine, benzene, dimethylformamide, chlorobenzene, anisole, ,N dimethyl acetamide, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, benzonitrile, chloroform, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile, diethylether, acetophenone, toluene, ethylene glycol, ethylene carbonate, and sulfolane. The preferred organic solvents will have carbon numbers ranging from 1 to about 20. Particularly desired solvents are those which give two phase systems which allow easy product separation such as, for example, nitromethane, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate. The amount of solvent added should be sufficient to dissolve the catalyst. The formic acid is utilized as a source of hydrogen for the process. It is present in the reaction mixture as a salt of the base promoter utilized. It is thought that dissociation of the formic acid base salt provides a suitable amount of formic acid necessary to provide the required hydrogen. Excess free acid present in the reaction mixture has an inhibitory effect on the reaction. It is desirable that some formic acid, as the salt, be present during the entire course of the reaction. When operating the process batch wise, this can be accomplished by adding a stoidnometric amount of formic acid initially, 1 mole of formic acid for every 2 moles of butadiene, or by continuously or periodically adding additional amounts of formic acid. It is highly desirable, however, that the ratio of base to formic acid present in the reaction medium never be less than 1. The base must be one which can neutralize formic acid according to the reaction HCOOH B , HCOO EB . The base may be either insoluble or soluble in the reaction medium. The base may be organic or inorganic. Suitable organic bases typically have dissociation constants greater than 10 and include tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tributyl amine, dimethylethyl amine, lutidine, tripropyl amine, Nmethyl morpholine. N methyl 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidine, 2,8 dimethylamine naphthalene and the like. Small amounts of water may be present. Suitable inorganic bases include ammonia, the hydroxide bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide ammonium hydroxide the carbonates and bicarbonates such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate and the like the weak bases such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium acetate and the like. When the inorganic bases are utilized, small amounts of water may be present. The mole ratio of base to formic acid should be at least equal to 1. when organic bases are utilized, excess base may be utilized as a solvent or the amine base salt may be used as the solvent. The catalyst used in the process of this invention is palladium or a palladium compound complexed with a phosphine ligand. The palladium may be in any of its possible valence states, e.g. 0, 2, etc. Suitable palladium compounds include the palladium carboxylates, particularly palladium carboxylates derived from alkanoic acids containing up to six carbon atoms such as palladium acetate, complexes such as palladium acetylacetonate, bis benzonitrile palladium II and lithium palladous chloride as well as the palladium halides, nitrates and sulfates such as palladous chloride and palladium nitrate Pd N03 2 OH 2 and palladium sulfate.Suitable palladium phosphine complexes are Pd RfP 2 or Pd R3P 3. The palladium is present in the reaction mixture in catalytic amounts preferably from about 1 to about 10 molar and more preferably from about 10 1 to about 10 molar. The tertiary alkyl phosphines utilized in the process of this invention have the following general formula R1R2R3P wherein R1 is a benzyl or an optionally unsaturated branched alkyl group, having from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms with branching occurmn2 at a carbon atom no more than two carbon atoms from the phosphorus atom and R2 and R3 are R1 or independently are optionally unsaturated alkyl or aryl groups having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. By branched is meant that the and e carbon atoms, relative to the phosphorus atom, of the alkyl group may not both be CR2 linkages. Hydrocarbyl groups are preferred.The alkyl group may be an unsaturated group, such as an alkenyl group or may be substituted by one or more aryl groups i.e. the alkyl group may be an aralkyl group or may be a cycloalkyl group. Illustrative of the R1 moiety are, for unsaturated alkyl, isopropyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, isobutyl, neopentyl, sec pentyl, tert pentyl, 2 methylbutyl, sec hexyl, tert hexyl, 2,2 dimethylpropyl for aralkyl, alpha methylbenzyl, alpha, alpha dimethylbenzyl, alpha methyl alphaethylbenzyl, phenylethyl, phenylisopropyl, phenyl tertbutyl for alkenyl, allyl, crotyl, methallyl 1 methylethenyl, 1 methyl 2 propenyl, 2 methyl 2 propenyl, 1,1 dimethyl 2 propenyl, 1 methyl 3 butenyl and, for cycloalkyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclo pentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and the like. R2 and R3 may also be unsaturated groups such as alkenyl groups illustrative of R2 and R3 are, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, nonyl and decyl for unsaturated alkyl allyl, crotyl and methallyl for alkenyl and phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, ethylphenyl, propylphenyl for aryl. Two or more of the instant phosphines may be used in the same reaction or another phosphine may be replaced by reacting in situ one of the instant phosphines. The mole ratio of tertiary phosphine to palladium is preferably at least 1. Preferably the mole ratio of phosphine to palladium ranges from about 1 1 to about 1 20 and preferably from about 2 1 to about 5 1. The use of the phosphines of the invention provides extremely high selectivities to 1,7 octadiene. The addition of carbon dioxide to the reaction system has been found to increase the extent of butadiene conversion, but does not affect the selectivity. When it is desired to use carbon dioxide to increase the conversion rate, the partial pressure of the C02 in the reaction system may be from about 10 to about 100 psia. Since carbon dioxide is a by product of the process, it is possible to generate sufficient carbon dioxide in situ to enhance the conversion rates. The process can be either continuous or batch. The reaction temperature of the process is not critical, however, it is preferred to maintain the reaction between about O to about 1000C, preferably between about 20 to about 700C. The process is conducted under a sufficient pressure to maintain liquid phase conditions at the reaction temperature. Typically the pressure is autogenous. The process of this invention is particularly useful when applied to a butadienW Isobutene n butenes BB3 stream from an oil pyrolysis unit.These B33 streams are the C4 cut from a thermal cracking unit typically containing 30 40 butadiene, 20 35 isobutene and 20 30 n butenes and many other minor components.
