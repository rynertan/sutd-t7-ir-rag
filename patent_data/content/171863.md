## Description
Briefly, this invention relates to improvements involving the reduction in size of a plug in fuse assembly like that disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,909,767, 3,962,782, 4,099,320, and other patents without diminution of function or quality. While these fuses were originally developed and still have their most important use as automobile fuses, they have other applications. More specifically, the invention relates to a substantial reduction in the size of the fuses disclosed in these patents facilitated by a unique construction thereof to be described. Both the miniaturized fuse of the invention and those disclosed in these patents preferably, but not necessarily, comprise an all fuse metal plug in fuse element formed by stamping the same from a strip of fuse metal. The stamping forms a pair of laterally spaced juxtaposed, parallel terminal blade portions to be received by pressure clip terminals in a mounting panel, current carrying extensions at the inner end portions of the pair of terminal blade portions and a fuse link portion of very small cross sectional area interconnecting the current carrying extensions. The shape, placement and or size and thickness of the fuse link determines the current rating of the fuse. As in the case of most fuses, they are designed to blow quickly under short circuit conditions, or with a minimum desired delay for lower overload current ratings like after .080 seconds for a 350 overload . This time delay before a fuse blows is affected by the mass or volume of the fuse link. It is generally desired to increase this time delay at high overload conditions. Generally, the method of making such a plug in fuse assembly, and as disclosed in said U.S. patents, comprises providing a strip of fuse metal which is progressively blanked or stamped to provide longitudinally spaced, interconnected fuse forming sections or blanks having the desired fuse element configurations as described. The spaced pairs of terminal blades are interconnected by transverse, relatively rigid webs when the fuse links are fragile. The exposed transverse webs interconnecting the pairs of terminal blades add rigidity to the strip and securely maintain the relative positions of the pairs of terminal blades, the current carrying extensions thereof and the more fragile interconnecting fuse link, until a housing or the like is inserted over and secured to each blank. The housing is most advantageously i.e. but not necessarily a single piece molding preferably of transparent material having an opening at one end thereof, preferably its bottom end, which enables the housing to be readily inserted over the end most blank of the strip before it is severed from the rest of the strip, with the terminal blade portions and web positioned outside of the housing. Before the web is removed therefrom, the housing may be staked into apertures in the current carrying extensions of the fuse metal element. The fuse development which is the subject of the above identified patents represents a major advance in the design of automotive fuses because the construction thereof permits the reliable, automated, low cost production thereof, and it greatly reduced the overall size and volume of the fuses in comparison to those used previously for this purpose. With the recent increase in the number of separately fused circuits in automobiles, there has been an increased need further to reduce the size of automotive fuses, to increase the packing density thereof and decrease the space requirements of the fuse mounting blocks into which the fuses are plugged. To this end, the proposed commercial form of the present invention provides a fuse which is much shorter, narrower, and thinner, and so occupies much less volume than the previous fuse designs. The size reduction is facilitated by the unique shape of the all metal plug in fuse element and its unique relationship to the housing applied thereover. Also, while some aspects of the invention do not so require, the preferred form of the invention utilizes a spacing between the confronting edges of the terminal blades which is similar to, preferably slightly greater than, that used in the larger fuses, so that the smaller fuses with narrower terminal blades can replace and be plugged into the same socket terminals as the larger fuses replaced thereby. While the preferred form of the fuses disclosed in the aforesaid patents utilize a single piece housing with an open bottom for receiving the current carrying extensions of the all metal fuse element, the broader aspects of the fuse design covered by the patents referred to encompass a two piece housing used by a licensee under these patents as well as other housing configurations. The licensee s housing is a two piece housing, where the bottom part has an opening in the top thereof into which the terminal blade end of the all metal plug in fuse element is inserted. The opening at the top of this bottom part of the housing assembly is closed by a cover piece placed and attached thereover. However, it was found that the former housing design having an opening at the bottom rather than at the top thereof is especially suitable for the design of a smaller fuse which is the subject of the present invention. In accordance with one of the features of the present invention, in order to reduce the width of the overall fuse design, instead of designing the current carrying extensions of the terminal blades as before, where their vertical outer margins were a vertical in line extension of corresponding margins of the terminal blades for their full height, the vertical outer margins of the current carrying extensions are offset inwardly, to provide an upwardly facing shoulder and clearance spaces thereabove for downward passage of the end walls of a narrow housing open at the bottom thereof. Thus, the end walls of the housing fit within these clearance spaces, and the bottom of the housing can, if desired, rest on these shoulders which can form convenient stop shoulders for limiting downward insertion of the housing over the all metal plug in fuse element. The otuer faces of the housing end walls are substantially in alignment with the outer vertical margins of the terminal blades, unlike the previous design where the housing projected substantially horizontally beyond the vertical margins of the terminal blades. It has to be noted that in GB A 2 090 081 a plug in fuse assembly is disclosed comprising a metal plug in element in a housing. The upwardly extending extensions of the terminals of the fuse element are inwardly offset. The offset is such that an upwardly directed extension or finger on each terminal is provided. Such finger is part of a securing mechanism. Together with notches in the inner part of the housing the fingers secure the terminals against lateral and rearward movement in the housing. The fuses of the invention are desirably positioned in their fuse mounting blocks so that their side faces are in close confronting relationship, where the pair of terminal blades of each fuse are closely spaced in a direction transversely to the positioning line of the fuses where there is little or no space to grasp the side faces of the fuse. Manual removal of a fuse from the fuse block thus makes desirable the provision of overlapping housing portions at least at the opposite ends of the top of each fuse housing. The resulting downwardly facing shoulders or lips at the ends of the fuse housing can be conveniently gripped for removal of the fuse from the fuse block. These lips in the present invention project horizontally from points on the housing substantially vertically aligned with the vertical outer margins of the terminal blades, rather than at points spaced substantially outwardly from these margins, as in the prior design of the larger fuses. It will be recalled that, in the preferred embodiment of the invention the housing is anchored to the all fuse metal plug in element by staking the element into apertures in the current carrying extensions thereof. Previously, these apertures were of an elongated rectangular shape with the long dimension extending parallel to the terminal blades. The present apertures thus interfere with current flow to a minimum degree. It has been found that the sharp corners of these apertures are the cause of occasional cracking of the housing at these points. A specific unique feature of the new fuse design is to round off the corners of the apertures. The apertures are preferably of a vertically elongated oval shape. As previously indicated, these apertures can form undesirable hot spots in the fuse if current must flow between the terminal blades and fuse link through the staking aperture containing portions of the current carrying extensions. Thus, these apertures reduce the cross sectional areas of the fuse metal and form areas of highest resistance where appreciable heat can be generated at abnormally high current levels. This heat can adversely effect the blowing conditions of the fuse, sometimes damage the housing or weaken its connections with the plug in fuse element. In the larger predecessor fuses, these apertures were found to cause this problem at the higher amperage ratings, such as 30 amps, if current was permitted to flow through the apertured portions of the fuse metal plug in element. For this reason, the fuse links of 30 amp fuses were placed below the staking apertures. Because the fuses of the invention which replace these larger fuses are so much smaller than the prior fuses they replaced, the practical upper limit for rated current of the new fuses is expected to be about 20 amps in those cases where current flows through the staking aperture portions of the fuse. The offsets described formed in the current carrying extensions of the miniaturized fuse of the present invention undesirably reduce the cross sectional area of the current carrying extensions of the terminal blades at these points of the fuse. In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the metal lost by the provision of each offset in the current carrying extensions which can cause a hot spot, is recovered, at least in part, by providing laterally inwardly projecting extensions of the inner vertical margins of the current carrying extension involved below them, so that the cross sectional area of the all fuse metal element at this point is satisfactorily large, to minimize the possibility of hot spot problems. In the previous fuse designs, the inner vertical margins of the current carrying extensions had no such laterally inwardly projecting extensions. In addition to the features of the invention which facilitate size reduction just described, another important feature of the invention relates to a uniquely sized, proportioned and positioned fuse link. This unique fuse link provides an increased mass volume of the fuse link to increase the fuse blowing time delay desired at high overload condition. Also, it was found that at least for low current ratings, the new fuse link is a more rigid element which is less likely to sag prior to fuse blowing conditions when the fuse is horizontally oriented. The new fuse link has throughout substantially its entire length an unusually narrow dimension for fuse links which are stamped from a sheet of metal. For example, at the lower current ratings, it preferably has a width of the order of magnitude of a small as about 0.127mm .005 and the thickness thereof is the full thickness of the fuse metal strip from which it is stamped 10.635mm e.g. .025 and so the strip is left unskived. Thus, the fuse link desirably has a width to thickness ratio much less than 1, such as no less than 1 2, and preferably as small as about 1 5 for the lowest current rating. The use of such a narrow filament like fuse link provides a maximum possible median length and volume for the fuse link within the position constraints placed thereon. Thus the curved portions of the fuse link should fall within a given rectangle which defines the closest permissible positioning of the curved portions of the fuse link to the adjacent portions of the housing and terminal blade extensions. As previously indicated, such a small ratio of width to thickness also makes the fuse link less likely to sag relative to a fuse link which is wider than it is thick, for at least the lower current rated fuses, when the fuse is horizontally oriented. However, it was strangely found that this anti sagging advantage did not occur at higher current ratings even though the fuse link is more rigid with the thickness ratios referred to. For the lower current rated fuses, where the overall fuse link resistance must be much higher than it is at higher current levels to effect blowing of the fuse, the larger resistance is best achieved by having a fuse link configuration which is S shaped. The unique S shape of the fuse to be described, combined with the small width to thickness ratios as described, provide a unique fuse link configuration providing both anti sagging properties and increased blowing time delay. The S shaped configuration most advantageously has upper and lower legs thereof which incline upwardly and downwardly respectively away from the points of connection thereof to the central regions of the current carrying extensions of the terminal blades. The angle of inclination is preferably of the order of magnitude of 45 . This contrasts with the almost horizontal upper and lower fuse link legs formed by the S and Z shaped fuse links of other manufacturers and by some of the S shaped links previously made by the assignee of this application. The above and other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon making reference to the specification and claims to follow and the drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a preferred form of the plug in fuse assembly of the invention Fig. 2 is an exploded view of the housing and plug in fuse element of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a top plan view of the plug in fuse assembly of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 shows in solid lines a vertical longitudinal sectional view through the plug in fuse assembly shown in Fig. 3, taken along section line IV IV therein, and pressure clip terminals therebelow designed for receiving the terminal blades of the predecessor fuse Fig. 5 is an enlarged bottom view of the plug in fuse assembly of Fig. 1 Fig. 6 is an enlarged transverse vertical sectional view through the plug in fuse assembly shown in Fig. 4, taken along section line VI VI thereof Fig. 7 is an enlarged vertical transverse sectional view through the center portion of the plug in fuse assembly shown in Fig. 4, taken along section line VII VII thereof Fig. 8 is a fragmentary elevational view showing in solid lines a portion of one current carrying extension and the adjacent portion of the S shaped fuse link of the lowest amperage fuse, and shows in dashed lines the greater width of the fuse link used in the highest amperage fuses Fig. 9 is a view of the smallest and highest amperage fuse links shown in Fig. 8 as viewed at right angles thereto Fig. 10 shows in solid lines the outlines of the all metal plug in fuse element of the fuse assembly of the present invention and in dashed lines the outline of the plug in fuse element of corresponding predecessor larger fuse, for 5 amp rated fuses and Fig. 11 is a view corresponding to that shown in Fig. 9 for 7½ amp rated fuses for the invention and predecessor fuse. Referring now more particularly to Figs. 1 4, there is shown a preferred plug in fuse assembly 2 of the invention. This assembly is made of only two component parts, namely an all metal plug in fuse element 4, which is a single stamping from a strip of fuse metal, and a housing 6 which most advantageously is a single piece synthetic plastic molded part defining a space therein into which portions of the plug in fuse element 4 extend and are secured in any suitable way, but most preferably by a cold staking and ultrasonic welding operation. The plug in fuse element 4 has terminal blade portions 8 8 plated with a highly conductive metal like tin and extending downwardly in spaced parallel juxtaposed relationship from the inner or bottom margin of the housing 6. The ends of the terminal blade portions 8 8 of the plug in fuse element, which are spaced apart as indicated at 12, are most advantageously tapered at 9 9 to form pointed end portions which readily slip into place between the confronting walls of conventional spring clip terminals T1 Fig. 4 . The current rating of the plug in fuse assembly as indicated by indicia 20 on the outer wall 38 of the housing and or by a distinctive housing color. The all metal plug in element 4 may be formed from a partially or completely tin plated strip of fuse metal not shown from which longitudinally spaced interconnected fuse blanks are stamped. prior to the plug in fuse element being severed from the strip, the terminal blade portions 8 8 may be interconnected by a transverse rigidifying web not shown stamped from the strip. The stamping operation also forms the terminal blade portions 8 8 separated by a gap 12. The tapered portions 9 9 of the terminal blade portions 8 8 may be formed by coining dies preferably after the operation which severs the plug in fuse element from the strip. The terminal blade portions 8 8 have current carrying extensions 14 14 which are also preferably tin plated including the outer end portions thereof where checking probe receiving tabs 18 18 are formed. The current carrying extensions project into the aforementioned space formed by the housing 6 where they are contiguous to the front or outer wall of the housing to be described. Especially for low current rated fuses, the current carrying extensions 14 14 are preferably interconnected by an S shaped fuse link portion 20 which is shown much narrower in width than it is thick. Except for this fuse link portion, the size and thickness of the rest of the plug in fuse element is sufficient to form a rigid, self supporting structure, as shown by the drawings. The current carrying capacity of the fuse link portion 20 may be varied by varying its location and its configuration including its width, length and thickness dimensions. As indicated in the introduction hereto, the S shaped fuse link illustrated is a uniquely proportioned fuse link to obtain a large time delay not used in the predecessor design. The current carrying extensions 14 14 join the fuse forming link portion 20 of the plug in fuse element 4 by tapered portions 22 22. All of the various parts of the plug in fuse element are shown substantially in coplanar relation. To anchor the plug in fuse element 4 within the housing 6, oval shaped staking of anchoring apertures 26 26 are formed in the current carrying extensions 14 14 to receive anchoring projections to be described formed in the housing walls. These apertures are elongated in a direction parallel to the terminal blades to minimize the resistance increasing effects thereof. The fuse link portion 20 shown in the drawings terminates in an upper leg 20a joining the left current carrying extension 14 at a point above the staking aperture 26 therein. The fuse link portion 20 has a lower leg 20b which joins the right current carrying extension 14 at a point below the associated staking aperture 26. The unique shape of this fuse link portion 20 will be later described. Thus, current which flows between the fuse link portion 20 and the left terminal blade portion will flow through the apertured portion of the left current carrying extension while current does not do so in the apertured portion of the right current carrying extension 14. The basic configuration of the terminal blade and current carrying extension portions are standardized for the different configurations used in the fuse link portions, so that common mechanical staking and ultrasonic welding equipment can be used for all fuses. In accordance with the preferred form of the present invention as previously described, it is desired that the spacing between the confronting inner edges 8b 8b of the terminal blade portions 8 8 be similar and preferably somewhat larger than that of the much larger predecessor fuses which they were designed to replace, as best shown by Figs. 10 and 11. Thus, Figs. 10 and 11 show in solid lines the fuse 2 of the invention and in dashed lines the outlines of part of the larger fuse which it replaced. Fig. 11 shows both fuse elements as formed by a punch and before assembly into their respective housings. Joining webs between the blades of each are left in place to insure rigidity during assembly, these webs being cut away thereafter along lines L4 and L4 respectively. Since, as there shown, the spacing between the confronting edges 8b 8b of the narrower terminal blade portions 8 8 of the fuse 2 of the present invention are spaced apart about the same, and preferably a somewhat greater distance than the terminal blade portions 8 8 of the larger fuse 2 it replaces, the fuse 2 is pluggable into the same but wider spring clip terminals T1 shown in Fig. 4, made for the larger fuse 2 and, more importantly, will adapt to spring clip terminals of similar inner spacing but of smaller overall width and correspondingly reduced size fuse mounting blocks. The confronting inner edges 8b 8b of the terminal blade portions 8 8 of the fuse 2 merge with inwardly offset vertical inner margins 14b 14b of the current carrying extensions 14 14. The terminal blades 8 8 are preferably of a consistent width up to the point where that portion of the plug in fuse element passes into the housing 6. Maintaining this consistent width over the full length of these exposed terminal blades reduces the electrical resistivity where the fuse engages the external terminals, and increases the thermal conductivity and current carrying capacity of the fuse. The inwardly offset confronting margins 14b 14b of the current carrying extensions 14 14 of the terminal blade portions 8 8 starting immediately above the terminal blade portions are provided to increase the spacing D1 Fig. 8 between the lower loop of the fuse link portion 20 and the left current carrying extension. This increases the width and mechanical strength of the portion of the manufacturing punch used to punch out this portion of the all metal plug in fuse element 2 from the strip of fuse metal, as previously described in the introductory part of this application. It should be appreciated that the punch needed to punch out that portion of the all fuse metal plug in fuse metal element 4 to the left of the fuse link portion 20 shown in Fig. 4 becomes especially weak if the punch becomes unduly narrow at the points thereof spaced substantially from the upper end thereof. For similar reasons, it is desirable to maximize the spacing between the upper loop of the fuse link portion 20 and the inner vertical margin of the upper end of the right current carrying extension 14, that is along the inner vertical margin 14e of the right current carrying extension 14. The upper ends of the offset inner vertical margins 14b 14b of the current carrying extensions 14 14 are shown merging with laterally projecting portions 14c 14c at points horizontally opposite the anchoring apertures 26 26. The laterally projecting portions 14c 14c of the current carrying extensions are absent in the previous fuse for reasons to be explained. As illustrated in Figs. 4, 10 and 11, the current carrying extensions 14 14 within the housing 6 have inwardly offset outer vertical margins 14a 14a forming upwardly facing stop shoulders 14d 14d and clearance spaces for the narrow end walls 34 34 of the housing 6. These end walls in previous fuse designs projected substantially horizontally beyond the vertical outer margins of the current carrying extensions 14 14, as indicated by dashed line 6 in Fig. 4. in the present invention, the outer surfaces of the housing end walls 34 34 are close to or are in substantially vertical alignment with the outer vertical margins 8a 8a of the terminal blade portions 8 8 of the plug in fuse element 4. The laterally projecting portions 14c 14c of the current carrying extensions 14 14 make up for part of the loss of metal caused by the inward offsetting of the outer vertical margins 14a 14a of the current carrying extensions 14 14, so that a desired cross sectional area of fuse metal material is present opposite the staking apertures 26 26 to avoid hot spots. If desired, these inwardly extending portions 14c 14c could be extended inwardly much further than that shown in the drawing if necessary to eliminate unsatisfactory hot spots, and the thickness of the fuse metal could be increased, if desired. Exemplary specifications for a 5 amp rated fuse are as follows It will be recalled that another unique feature of the invention has to do with the design of the S shape fuse link portion 20 of the all fuse metal plug in fuse element 4. To best understand this uniqueness, reference should be made to Fig. 10 which shows the all fuse metal plug in fuse element 4 of the larger predecessor 3 amp fuse the lowest reliable current rated fuse previously sold for automotive purposes and the correspondingly rated all fuse metal plug in fuse element 4 of the preferred form of the fuse of the present invention. It will be noted that the Z shaped fuse link 20 of the predecessor fuse element 4 has straight horizontal upper and lower end portions or legs 20a and 20b joining the current carrying extensions 14 14 near the upper or lower ends thereof, whereas the upper and lower legs 20a and 20b of the preferred fuse link of the present invention incline preferably at an angle of about 45 degrees and join the current carrying extensions 14 14 at points in the central portions thereof near but above and below the left and right staking apertures 26 26 respectively. The fuse link portion 20 has a straight central leg 20e extending at inclined angles corresponding to that of the straight central leg 20e of the predecessor fuse and similar to the angles of inclination of the outer legs 20a and 20b thereof. The overall length of the fuse link portion 20 is thus substantially greater than the overall length of the fuse link portion 20 of the predecessor fuse. As previously indicated, the width of the fuse link portion 20 is exceedingly small, being preferably only a small fraction of the thickness of the metal from which the plug in fuse element 4 is stamped. This has the advantage of providing a fuse link of a maximum overall median length so that for a fuse link of a given overall cross sectional area there is a maximum mass or volume of fuse link material, increasing the time delay characteristics of the fuse. In Fig. 11 there is a dashed rectangular box B1 which defines the outermost extremities of the curved portions of the desired fuse link where there is a minimum acceptable spacing between the knee or curved portions of the fuse link and the adjacent portions of the fuse housing and current carrying extensions 14 l4 . If an S shaped fuse link portion encompassing the same area defined by the box B1 were to have a much greater width than that shown in solid lines for a given fixed overall fuse link cross sectional area, the median length and overall volume of the fuse link material involved would be much less than that of fuse link portion 20, resulting in a smaller time delay before the fuse would blow. The fuse link portion 20 of the 5 amp fuse of Fig. 10 has the same median path length and shape as but a different thickness than that of the fuse link portion 20 of the 7½ amp fuse of Fig. 11. It is noted also that the fuse link portion 20 for the 7½ amp predecessor fuse shown in dashed lines in Fig. 11 has a completely different shape and width than the S shaped fuse link portion 20 of Figs. 10 and 11 and Z shaped fuse link portion 20 of the prior 5 amp fuse shown in Fig. 10. In general, as the current ratings of the fuses of the present invention increase from 5 amps, as best shown in Fig. 8, the distance D1 Fig. 8 between the looped portions 20c and 20d of the fuse link portion 20 of the fuse will decrease. The width of a low amperage fuse such as 5 amps in the example of the invention described is shown in dashed lines in Fig. 8 with a minimum width W1 and that of the highest amperage fuse is shown in solid lines with a maximum width W2, where the distance D1 between the fuse link and current carrying extension is at a minimum. As previously indicated, this minimum distance D1 is limited so that the portion of the punch which forms this portion of the element can be readily made with adequate strength. Such a minimum distance may be, for example, .057 . Fig. 9 shows the minimum and maximum thickness t1 and t2 respectively used for the lowest and highest amperage fuses. Exemplary thickness for t1 and t2 are .004 and .025 , respectively. The straight portions of the upper and lower fuse link legs 20a and 20b are desirably at least about 1 2 the length of the straight intermediate leg 20e thereof. Fig. 10 shows the fuse link segment lengths L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5 for the various contiguous segments of the S shaped fuse link portion illustrated therein. These segment lengths may be .084 , .108 , .173 , .108 and .084 , respectively. While the overall length and time delay characteristics of the fuse link could be increased if the upper and lower legs 20 and 20b of the fuse link portion 20 joined the current carrying extensions at points directly opposite the apertures 26 26, primarily because of the requirements of good tool design practices which would be violated under such circumstances, it was found desirable to shorten somewhat the overall length of the fuse link portion by connecting the upper and lower legs 20a and 20b to these extensions at points respectively above and below the apertures 26 26. The unique S shaped configuration of the present invention also provides a most reliable fuse because it isolates to an optimum degree the central portion of the centermost leg where the fuse blows from the various heat generating portions of the fuse. Thus, the various legs of the preferred fuse link have relatively narrow and long profiles providing the maximum separation thereof. As shown in Fig. 11, this isolation is much greater in the case of the plug in fuse element 4 of the invention than it is for the predecessor plug in fuse element 4 where the outer end portions of the fuse filament 20 are spaced much closer to the center leg thereof. While the housing 6 could be made in separate parts snappable or otherwise secured together to form a single piece at the time the housing is assembled, the housing is most advantageously a single piece integral molded part as shown. Also, it preferably has relatively closely spaced side walls generally indicated by reference numeral 30 32 Figs. 6 7 , the side walls having end portions 30a 32a which are spaced together much more closely than the central or intermediate portions 30b 32b thereof. The side walls 30 32 are interconnected at their end margins by the narrow end walls 34 34 Fig. 5 , and at their outer or top margins by the outer wall 38 Fig. 6 which overhangs the rest of the housing to form downwardly facing shoulders 40 40 at the longitudinal ends of the outer wall 38 and downwardly facing shoulders 40 40 along the longitudinal side margins of the housing 6. Terminal access openings 42 42 are provided in the outer wall 38 adjacent the opposite end portions thereof in alignment with the location of the test probe receiving tabs 18 18 of the plug in fuse element 6. The walls of the terminal access openings 42 42 taper down to an inner dimension which approximates the width of the test probe receiving tabs 18 18 so that test probes can be guided into contact with the tabs 18 18. The tabs 18 18 are preferably peened to further anchor the housing 6 to the plug in fuse element 4. The terminal access openings 42 42 communicate with the aforementioned plug in fuse element receiving space in the housing 4. The portions 44 44 of this space immediately beneath the access opening 42 42 are relatively small because of the close spacing of the side wall portions 30a 32a of the housing at these points, the width of the space portion 44 44 as viewed in Fig. 6 tapering from the bottom open end of the housing upwardly toward the terminal access openings 42 42, reaching a narrow dimension about equal to the thickness of the plug in fuse element 4. At the inner margins of the terminal access openings 42 42 the upper wall 38 is provided with downwardly extending skirts 46 46 Fig. 4 which act as shield walls to prevent spewing fuse metal from gaining entrance to the terminal access openings 42 42. These skirts 46 46 also increase the strength of the upper wall 38 which had to be thinned somewhat in the middle thereof to provide substantial spacing of the housing from the upper loop 20c of the fuse link 20. The fuse link portion 20 of the fuse element 4 is positioned in a relatively wide portion 44 Fig. 7 of the housing interior, to provide for free circulation of air around the center portion of the fuse forming link portion, which is the part thereof which first melts under excessive current flow, so heat does not accumulate which would adversely affect the current at which the fuse will blow. The narrow and wide portions 44 44 and 44 of the space within the housing 6 open onto the bottom of the housing for the full extent thereof through an entry opening 48. The opening 48 permits the housing to be pushed over the end portion of the end blank of the pre stamped and preferably milled strip from which a completed fuse element is punched and immediately following this operation the housing 6 is secured by staking to the end portion or end blank of the strip, as previously indicated. The housing 6 is preferably a molded part made of a transparent synthetic plastic material so that the fuse link portion 20 of the plug in fuse element 4 is readily visible through the housing walls. While the housing interior could be made with resilient projections which snap into the anchoring apertures 26 26 in the plug in fuse element 4, it is preferred to secure the housing in place by forming projections 52 from both sides of the housing 6 by first a mechanical staking operation, which projections enter the anchoring apertures 26 26 of the plug in fuse element 4. The inwardly extending projections 52 formed by the mechanical staking operation where they engage each other in the anchoring apertures or openings 26 are preferably later ultrasonically welded together by ultrasonic welding or the like to provide a more rigid and structurally stable anchoring structure. The depressions 56 left by the staking operation are shown in the side wall 30 in Figs. 1 and 6. As previously indicated, the anchoring apertures 26 26 of the previous fuse design were rectangular in shape. However, to eliminate cracking of the synthetic plastic material in some cases due to the sharp corners of these apertures, it was found most desirable that this aperture be made of a vertically elongated oval shape. it is vertically elongated to minimize the width of the aperture to reduce the cross sectional area of the current carrying extensions 14 14 at this point to a more modest degree. The exemplary embodiments of the fuse assemblies described have thus provided exceedingly compact plug in fuse assemblies which can be readily inserted into and removed from suitable closely spaced spring clip terminal connectors in a mounting panel by manually grasping the shoulders 40 40 at the longitudinal ends of the housing 6 or by a tool which can engage these or the side shoulders 40 40 . It should be understood that numerous modifications may be made in the most preferred form of the invention described without deviating from the broader aspects of the invention. For example, while the invention has its most important application in the fuse having an all metal fuse plug in element, some of the teachings of the invention are also applicable to fuses where fuse metal foil placed over a core of insulation material or where the entire terminal blades are made of a metal other than fuse metal, the fuse link may be a separate element soldered or otherwise connected between the current carrying extensions involved. Also, for convenience of description, the fuse of the invention has been described and claimed with an assumed vertical orientation as shown in the drawings. However, it is to be understood that in use it may be mounted with other orientations, such as a horizontal orientation, which is commonly the case.
