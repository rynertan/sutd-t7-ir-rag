## Description
PROCESS FOR EXPRESSING THE BOVINE GROWTH HORMONE GENE, AND PLASMIDS FOR USE THEREIN The present invention relates to a process for the expression of the bovine growth hormone structural gene. The present invention also relates to novel plasmid vehicles which can be used in the process. Many of the potential benefits envisaged as a result of the application of recombinant DNA technology to medical problems require the insertion, into host organisms, of genes able to direct the biosynthesis of required proteins. In most cases a protein of interest will normally be synthesised in animal cells and not naturally found in yeasts or other lower eukaryotes. Although it has been possible to clone a number of different animal genes containing the information necessary to code for proteins, reports of the expression of these proteins in bacteria and other unicellular organisms is limited. Some which have been expressed in E. coli are the human polypeptide hormone somatostatin see Itakura et al, 1977 Science 198 1056 1063 ,rat proinsulin, and human insulin chains. The inventors succeeded in expressing the chicken ovalbumin gene in E. coli HB101, by fusing this gene near transcriptional and translational initiation regions seeProceedings of National Academy of Sciences 1978 75 593640. They subsequently succeeded in expressing the same gene in yeast, by fusing the gene in the correct orientation relative to a transcriptional initiation region. According to the present invention, using recombinantDNA methodology, described below, the bovine growth hormone bGH structural gene has been fused to a S. cerevisiae transcriptional control region. When a plasmid containing the hybrid gene is introduced into S. cerevisie, a protein identified as bovine growth hormone by immunoreactivity is synthesised. Bovine growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids that is synthesised in the anterior pituitary. The molecular weight of the mature protein is about 22,000 daltons, but it is initially made as a pre growth hormone, with an extra 26 amino acids on the amino terminal end. This tail is normally cleaved during secretion of the hormone.Administration of exogenous bovine growth hormone increases milk production ih cows and may increase meat production.EMI2.1 The drawing depicts the process steps to make the bGH fused yeast plasmid pBGH1.

Nat. Acad. Sci. 76 1035.1039 contains an E.co7i replication origin and ampicillin resistance marker derived from pBR322 so that it carr be maintained in E. coli. In addition , it contains a yeast plasmid replication origin and yeast His3 gene so that it can be maintained in his yeast auxotrophs. The YEp6 plasmid also has a unique Sal I restriction endonuclease site which can be used for cloning foreign DNA. Construction of the YEp6 pLG23 fused plasmid, pBGH1, proceeds as shown in the drawing. The. YEp6 plasmid is cut with Sal I and the resulting linear molecule is. treated, advantageously, with alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5 phosphate groups on the ends of the molecule. The pLG23 plasmid contains nearly all of the bGH mRNA sequence, including all of the information required to code for the amino acid sequence of bGH. This plasmid is cut with Sal I, ligated with the alkaline phosphatase treated, Sal I cut YEp6 and transformed into E.coli. Transformants are selected on ampicillin plates and their plasmid DNA s analyzed. Preparations of the plasmid DNA s are made by growth in E. coli and used to transform S. cerevisiae. His transformants are selected on supplemented minimal media plates under conditions where the His parents can not grow. The transformants are then grown in broth and lysed. The extracts are analyzed for bGH immunoreactivity with an 1251 radioimmunoassay. The following examples are illustrative of the process and products of the subject invention but are not to be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. Example 1 DNA Preparation pLG23 plasmid DNA from NRRL a 12436 is isolated by the salt precipitation technique described by Guerry et al. CGuerry, P.,LeBlanc, D.J. and Falkow, S. 1973 , J. Bact. 116 1064 1066 L broth ELennox, E.S. 1955 , Virology 1 190 206 containing 10 vg ml tetracycline is inoculated with an overnight broth culture of NRRL B 12436. Cultures are shaken vigorously at 370C. until the optical density at 600 nm reaches 0.8 plasmid copy number is then amplified for 18 hours with chloramphenicol 250 vg m79. Cells are washed once in 50 mM TnsHCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, and resuspended in 33 ml of 252 sucrose in TE 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA per liter of culture. Following the addition of 1 mg ml lysozyme, the suspension is incubated on ice for five minutes, followed by addition of 1 3 volume of 0.25 M EDTA, pH 8.0 and another 5 minute incubation on ice.Cells are lysed by addition of 10 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS in 37 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.0, 67 mM EDTA, to a final concentration of 1.3 followed by incubation at 370C. for 30 minutes. Chromosomal DNA is salted out by bringing the NaCI concentration to 1 M followed by cooling at 40C. overnight. SDS and chromosomal DNA are removed by centrifuging at 17,000 x g for 30 minutes at 40C.The resulting supernatant is ethanol precipitated, pelleted, and redissolved in TE. This material is phenol extracted twice, ether extracted, ethanol precipitated, pelleted and resuspended in TE. Plasmid DNA is further purified by cesium chloride ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation. Cesium chloride is dissolved in the DNA solution at a ratio of 1 1 wt. vo7. , followed by addition of 550 lg ml ethidium bromide Gradients are centrifuged for approximately 40 hours at ca. 100,000 x g. Plasmid DNA is removed from the gradient by needle puncture, and the ethidium bromide extracted with Hz0 saturated 1 butanol. DNA is then dialyzed in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, followed by a final ethanol precipitation. Purified plasmid DNA is dissolved in 10 mM TrisHÃ‡l, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA. If ampicillin is substituted for tetracycline in the method described above for preparing pLG23 DNA, the method can also be used to prepare YEp6 DNA and pBGH1 DNA in E. coli. Other plasmid DNA s can be prepared by this method if an appropriate selection i.e., another antibiotic is used to maintain the plasmid in the culture. Also, it is within the skill of those in the art to vary the above conditions to prepare plasmid DNA.Example 2 Restriction Endonuclease Digestions Sal I digestion of YEp6 DNA and pLG23 DNA, prepared as described in Example 1, is done in a reaction mixture containing 6 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mM MgC12, 150 mM Nail, 6 sM mercaptoethanol, 100 ug ml autoclaved gelatin, 80 ag ml DNA and 80 units ml Sal I restriction endonuclease. After incubation for 60 minutes at 370C., the reaction mixture is phenol extracted, ether extracted and ethanol precipitated. It should be realized that the use of another vehicle might require the use of a different restriction endonuclease. It is within the skill of those in the art to vary the concentrations of reagents, substrates and enzymes as well as reaction conditions to obtain the desired cleavages.Example 3 Alkaline Phosohatase Treatment This procedure is carried out essentially as described byUllrich et al. Ullrich, A., Shine, J., Chirgwin, J., Pictet, R.,Tischer, E., Rutter, W.J., and Goodman, H.M. 1977 Science 196 1313 1319 with some minor modifications. Twelve units ml of bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAPF, Worthington in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, are pre incubated at 700C. for 10 minutes. One hundred vg ml ofSal I cut YEp6 DNA, prepared as described in Example 2, is then added and incubation at 700C continues for 15 minutes. The reaction mixture is then phenol extracted three times, ether extracted, and ethanol precipitated. This procedure is optional in the preparation of pBGH1. However, use of the procedure affords a higher ratio of pBGH1 to parental YEp6 plasmid among ampicillin resistant transformants, thereby facilitating the recovery of pBGH1.Example 4 T4 DNA Ligase In order to ligate the pLG23 DNA to the alkaline phosphatase treated YEp6 DNA, prepared as described in Example 3, the reaction mixture contains 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 30 vg ml YEp6 DNA, 6 ug ml Sal I cut pLG23 and 15 units mi of T4 DNA ligase. After incubation for 16 hours at 12.50C., the reaction mixture is ethanol precipitated and the pellet dissolved in TCM 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM Call 2, 10 mM MgC12 . It is within the skill of those in the art to vary the concentrations of reagents, substrates and enzymes, as well as reaction conditions, to obtain the desired ligations.Example 5 Transformation of E. coli One hundred twenty ml. of L broth 1 tryptone, 0.5 yeast extract, 0.5X NaCl are inoculated with an 18 hour culture of HB101NRRL B 11371 and grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Cells are washed tn cold 10 mM MgSO4 and resuspended for 15 minutes in 20 ml chilled 50 mM Caul 2. Bacteria are then concentrated to one tenth of this volume in CaCl2 and mixed 2 1 v v with ligated DNA, prepared as described in Example 4. After chilling the cell DNA mixture for 15 minutes, it is heat shocked at 420C. for 2 minutes, then allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for ten minutes before addition ofL broth 2 1 3 times the volume of the cell DNA suspension.Transformed cells are incubated in broth at 370C. for one hour before inoculating selective media L agar plus 20 vgiml ampicillin with 200 vl per plate. Plates are incubated at 37 C. for 48 hours to allow the growth of transformants. This procedure yields E. coli HB101 pBG rf 1 , NRRL 8 12483. Although the transformation procedure is essential for the amplification of biochemically constructed recombinant DNA molecules, the choice of conditions for such a procedure can be changed by those skilled in the art to achieve the desired purpose. The plasmid DNA is isolated from E. coli HB101 pBGH1 , NRRL 8 12483, by using the procedures of Example 1. The isolated DNA is then transformed into yeast as disclosed in Example 6, infra.Example 6 Transformation of NRRL Y 12484 to NRRL Y 12485 LL20 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae leu hits , NRRL Y 12484 is transformed as follows Twenty ml of log phase culture grown inYEPD broth 1X yeast extract, 2 peptone, 2 glucose to an 00600 of 2.0 3 x 107 cells ml were pelleted and resuspended in 1 10 volume 0.9 M sorbitol, 50 mM KPO4 buffer pH 7.5, 14 mM s merc ptoethanol. Spheroplasts are formed by addition of 1 Glusulase Endo Laboratories and incubation at 300C. for 60 minutes. After washing three times in 1 M sorbitol, spheroplasts are resuspended in 1 100 original culture volume of 1 M sorbitol, 10 SM Tris HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaC12. pBGH1 DNA is added to a final concentration of 20 ug ml. After incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes, 10 volumes of 40 polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 mM tris HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaC12 are added, followed by 10 minutes incubation at room temperature. His trans formants are selected by overlaying minimal agar EO.7 yeast nitrogen base Difco , 2 glucose, 2 agarose, supplemented with 20 vg ml uracil, adenine and tryptophan and 30 vg ml leucine with 0.2 ml cells suspended in 10 ml molten 45 C. regeneration medium minimal medium containing 1 M sorbitol, 2 YEPD and 3 agarose . Plates are incubated at 28 C for 5 6 days. Also, it is within the skill of those in the art to vary the above conditions for yeast transformation.Example 7 Yeast Cell Extract Preparation Yeast cells grown in 100 ml minimal medium at 300C. to stationary phase are pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of 1 glusulase Endo Laboratories in 1 M sorbitol. The cells are then incubated at 300C. for 90 minutes and pelleted at 4,000 rpm in a Sorvall HB 4 rotor for 5 minutes The pelleted spheroplasts are resuspended in extraction buffer containing 1 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Nail. The resuspended spheroplasts are then frozen and thawed three times and the cell debris removed by centrifugation. The final protein concentration as determined by absorbance at 280 and 260 nm is approximately 8 mg ml.Example 8 Radioimmunoassay The assay is performed in 12 x 75 mm disposable polypropylene culture tubes. On day one, 400 vl of PBS phosphate buffered saline 1 BSA bovine serum albumin , 100 ul of standard or sample, and 200 ul of diluted anti bGH serum are added to the tubes. Prior to the assay the antiserum against bGH is diluted 1 400 with 0.05 M EDTA PBS at pH 7.0, and then diluted to the final working concentration 1 25000 with normal guinea pig serum diluted 1 400 with EDTA PBS at pH 7.0. The contents of each tube are mixed and incubated at 40C. for 24 hours. On day two, 100 vl of labeled 125I bGH are added to each tube, the contents are mixed and incubated at 4 C. for an additional 24 hours.On day three, 200 iil of anti guinea pig gamma globulin serium diluted 1 15 with EDTA PBS are added to each tube, contents mixed and incubated at 40C. for an additional 72 hours. On day six, 3 ml of PBS are added to each tube and the tubes are centrifuged at 2500RPM 1800 x g for 30 minutes. The supernatant is decanted and the precipitate counted for one minute in a gamma counter.Example 9 Other Vehicles, Hosts, and Gene Sources Examples of other vehicles which can be used in the invention are any that can replicate within yeast, such as YEp2, YEp4, YRp7, YEp20. Also vectors that can replicate in other lower eukaryotic hosts. Examples of other hosts for the vehicle are any S. cerevisiae derivative or other fungi. It is recognized that these latter hosts would have to be approved by the NIH Guidelines.Examole 10 Purification of bGH The transformed yeast cells of Example 6 are grown in minimal medium EO.7 yeast nitrogen base, 2 glucose, supplemented with 20 mg ml uracil, adenine and tryptophan, and 30 ug ml leucine to early stationary phase, and washed in Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline Gibco .
