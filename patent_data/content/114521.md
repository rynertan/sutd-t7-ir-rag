# Plasma arc process.

## Abstract
In a combination plasma arc torch and nozzle assembly 10 the arc plasma gas composition contains at least 40 oxygen. An oxygen containing reactive gas is passed through a gap 13 between a first 12 and second 14 nozzle body of a nozzle assembly having a first 18 and second 22 arc constricting passageway adapted to constrict the arc plasma. The width X of the gap is of a critical dimension to permit a tungsten electrode E, 17 to be used without suffering from rapid electrode erosion.
