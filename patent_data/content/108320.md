# Method of applying decorative foil.

## Abstract
A desired decorative design on packaging such as tubes is made up of a combination of printed matter and a decorative foil such as a metal, pigmented or textured pattern foil. The method of applying the design involves the steps of first applying the printed matter 39 to the material 38 with an ink treated to prevent adherence of the foil 40 to the printed matter 39 . Thereafter, the foil 40 coated with an adhesive 17 is positioned against the material 38 and heat and or pressure applied so that a foil transfer will occur onto all areas of the material engaged by the foil that are devoid of the printed matter. The foil is applied with a smooth continuous silicone pad 41 . Exact registration is assured and the use of complicated die designs is wholly avoided.
