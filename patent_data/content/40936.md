# DC Motor control system and method of DC motor control.

## Abstract
A d.c. generator 36 is connected in series opposed to the polarity of a d.c. power source 34 supplying a d.c. drive motor 32. The generator 36 is part of a motor generator set, the motor 38 of which is supplied from the power source 34 connected to the drive motor 32. A generator field control means 44 varies the field produced by at least one of the generator field windings 36a in order to change the effective voltage output of the generator 36. When the generator voltage is exactly equal to the d.c. voltage sup ply, no voltage is applied across the drive motor 32. As the field of the generator 36 is reduced, the drive motor 32 is supplied with an increasing voltage until the full voltage of the d.c. power source 34 is supplied when the generator 36 has zero field applied. Additional voltage may be applied across the drive motor 32 by reversing and increasing the reversed field on the generator 36. The drive motor 32 may be made to rotate in the opposite direction from standstill by increasing the generator field so that a reverse voltage is applied across the d.c. motor 32. The system has parti cular application to vehicular drives. Reactive braking is possible, energy extracted from the vehicle 30 by the motor 32 being fed back to the battery 34. The power source can be a.c., the motor 38 then being an a.c. motor and the bat tery 34 a rectifier circuit.
