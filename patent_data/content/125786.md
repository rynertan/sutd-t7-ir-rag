# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A pair of mateable connector parts having terminals 22, 26 mounted in housings 18, 20 includes means 64, 66 for preventing the mating of the connector parts if any one termi nal is not fully inserted into its cavity 22 . Thus, projections 64 are provided on each housing which are normally received within corresponding recesses 66 formed adjacent each terminal receiving cavity 22 in the opposite housing. A flexible wall is disposed between each recess 66 and the adjacent terminal receiving cavity 22 . The flexible wall 44 is movable towards the interior of the recess 66 when the terminal in the adjacent cavity is not fully inserted therein in order to prevent the receipt of the corresponding projec tion 64 in the recess.
