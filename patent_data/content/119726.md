# Valve for an hydraulic ram.

## Abstract
The valving means comprises a spool member 20 slide ably mounted within the ram and having ports 13a and 14a therein adapted to register with co operating ports 13 and 14 in the cylinder wall upon axial movement of the spool member 20 the spool member 20 being formed with a circumferential recess 21 therein which is adapted at substantially all positions of the spool member 20 to be in fluid flow communication with an inlet port 14b and 14c for fluid under pressure, there being formed at the end of the spool member 20 a chamber 30 adapted to be in fluid flow communication with fluid under pressure or with an environment at lower pressure whereby fluid under pressure can act on the end face 31 of the spool member 20 , the effective radial area of the end face 31 of the spool member 20 exposed to the fluid being greater than the difference in effective radial areas of the two radial side walls 27 and 27a of the circumfe rential recess 21 , the effective radial area of that side wall 27 adjacent the end wall 31 of the spool member 20 being greater than the effective radial area of the other side wall 27a of the recess 21 , whereby application of fluid under pressure to the recess 21 is adapted to cause the spool member 20 to move axially with respect to the chamber 30 and application of fluid under pressure to the chamber 30 is adapted to cause the spool member 20 to move axially in the opposite direction.
