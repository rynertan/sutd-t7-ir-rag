## Abstract
With an ultrasonic scanner for coeliac examination, the distal end of the insertion section 18 is provided with a distal end part 20 consisting of a beam scanning section 40 and beam transmitting and receiving section 42 . The beam scanning section 40 comprises a beam mirror 48 set in a beam scanning chamber 46 formed in a casing 44 . A reflec tion plane 50 formed at one end of the beam mirror 48 is inclined at an angle of, for example, 45 to its rotation axis. The beam mirror 48 is rotated by means of a mirror shaft 54 and flexible shaft 24 . The beam transmitting and receiving section 42 comprises a holder 58 in which a vibrator 60 is set. The holder 58 is securely fitted into a receptacle 62 formed in the casing 44 by the threaded engagement of a fitting cap 70 with the receptacle 62 . The vibrator 60 is electrically connected to the insertion body 18 in a detach able state.
