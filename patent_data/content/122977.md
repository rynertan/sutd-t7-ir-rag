# Hydrocarbon treating process having minimum gaseous effluent.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for treating hydrocarbon streams 1 for the purpose of removing mercaptans and also convert ing the remaining mercaptans to disulfldes which remain in the hydrocarbon stream being treated. The hydrocarbons rise through a contacting column 2 countercurrently to a descending stream of an aqueous alkaline solution 3 . A limited amount of an oxygen containing gas 4 is passed into an intermediate point in the column 2 thereby dividing it into an upper sweetening section and a lower extraction section. The flow rate of the oxygen containing stream is preferably low enough that any gas not consumed in the catalytic oxida tion of mercaptans becomes dissolved in the hydrocarbon product stream, and preferably remains dissolved at atmos pheric pressure.
