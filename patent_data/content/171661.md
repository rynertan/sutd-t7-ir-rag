## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD OF PREPARING CATIONIC TERPOLYMERS AND PRODUCT DERIVED THEREFROM This invention relates to high molecular weight soluble terpolymers derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers with pendent amide groups, carboxyl groups and ester groups coPtaining a 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride moiety that are useful as flocculants of high efficacy. These terpolymers may be prepared by reaction between glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride and copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polymers containg the 2 hydroxyproplytrialkylammonium chloride unit are known. They are typically prepared, for example as described in U.S. Patent 3,428,617 by polymerization and copolymerizationof monomers of the type of 2 hydroxy 3 acryloxypropyltrimethylammoniumchloride and, in the case of copolymerization, with various vinyl type monomers. These polymers are used as retention aids in paper manufacturing, as flocculating agents and for the treatment of fibrous materials. It is also known that polymers derived from ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and characterized by the presence of quaternary ammonium groups are flocculant agents and are effective in the dewatering of aqueous suspensions. Polymers of this type are described in U.S. Patent 3,023,162 and are derived by direct polymerization of aminoalkylesters of acrylic acids containing basic tertiary amine groups, their salts or quaternary structures. In order to be effective as flocculant, however, at least 45 of the tertiary amine groups of the polymer must converted to quaternary ammonium gropus by means of a C2 or C3 alkylene oxide. Further, U.S. Patent 3,730,888 discloses flocculants obtained by reaction between a glycidyl tertiary amine and a polymer containing carboxyl groups, where the latter are derived from an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. According to the disclosure of this patent, the glycidyl tertiary amine is used either as the free base or in salt form, and the substituents on the nitrogen atom must contain from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. The polymers are used as papermaking aids. In essence this prior art indicates that 1. polymers containg 2 hydroxyproplytrimethyl ammonium chloride moieties can be obtained by polymerization of 2 hydroxy 3 acrylyloxylpropyltr imethylammonium chloride. 2. polymers derived from ethyleically unsaturated tertiary aminoalkylesters are flocculant agents if more than about 45 of the tertiary amino groups have been converted to quaternary ammonium groups. 3. polymers containing carboxyl groups are capable of reacting via these groups with glycidyl tertiary amines. These polymers are indicated to be effective as flocculants if the substituents on the nitrogen contain from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. None of the known prior art discloses that polymers containing quarternary ammonium groups in addition to carboxyl groups or carboxylate groups are effective flocculants. We have found that a need exists for improved flocculants, derived from acrylamide acrylic acid copolymers, which are effective when they contain amounts as little as 4 to 7 of chain segments containing the 2 hydroxylproply trimethylammonium chloride moiety. Copolymers containing this moiety may be obtained by polymerization of acrylamide in the presence of 2 hydroxy 3 acrylyloxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride or, more advantageously, by reaction of an acrylamide acrylic acid copolymer with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride. The reaction can be conducted in an heterogeneous system entailing the solid copolymer and a solution of the glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride.The discovery of this particular reaction is significant because it constitutes a convenient method for introducing a high concentration of charged centers into a high molecular weight polymer and yields an essentially solid reaction product which appears to dissolve more readily than the starting copolymer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention novel polymeric compositions containing cationic centers are prepared that are highly useful as flocculants and sludge dewatering agents. These water soluble polymers contain segments of acrylamide or methacrylamide, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, and units containing a 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride moiety and yield new and useful polymer flocculant compositions. The novel polymeric water soluble cationic compositions of the invention are obtained by reacting copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid both either substituted or unsubstituted with glycidyltrialkylammoniumchloride preferably with glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride. The reaction may be suitably effected by a heterogeneous reaction entailing the solid acrylamide acrylic acid copolymer and a solution of the glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride. It is accordingly a primary object to provide novel cationic polymer compositions utilizing a convenient method for introducing a high concentration of charged centers into a high molecular weight polymer. A related advantageous object is to obtain an essentially solid polymeric reaction product which appears to dissolve more readily than the starting copolymer. Additional objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description and examples provided hereinafter. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The figure of the drawing illustrates the relative efficiency of the polymeric composition of the invention P1 and P2 through their specific filtration resistance SFR compared to a commercial flocculant CF . DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the invention, novel water soluble polymers containg segments of a acrylamide or methacrylamide, b acrylic acid or methacrylic acide, and c units containing a 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammoniumchloride moiety are provided. These new and useful polymer flocculant compositions are obtained by reacting copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid both either substituted or unsubstituted with glycidyltrialkylammonium chloride preferably with glycidlytrimethylammoniumchloride. I have discovered that quaternary ammonium groups such as the one present in the 2hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride can be introduced into carboxyl groups containing polymers by reaction between such polymers and glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride. Although this reaction appears to proceed without any added catalyst, I have found that the presence of 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammoniumchloride is effective in catalying the reaction. I have also found that in case of the quaternary ammonium groups there is no need for each of the nitrogen substituents to have more than one carbon atom in order to be effective flocculants. Also, quite surprisingly, I have found that high flocculant efficacy was observed for compositions that contained considerably less than 45 of moieties with quaternary ammonium groups and that excellent performance is obtained with compositions derived from acrylamideacrylic acid copolymers that contained as little as 4 7 of chain segments containg the 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammoniumchloride moiety which in all probability may be connected to the polymer backbone via an ester linkage. Since, in addition to this unit, the polymer contains both segments having attached an amide group and segments with a carboxylic acid group, the polymers of this invention are terpolymers. The acrylamide acrylic acid copolymers may be obtained by any known process such as mentioned for instance in Kirk Othmer Encyl. of Chem. Technology, Vol, 10, p. 506 entailing either copolymerization of the corresponding monomers or controlled hydrolysis of either polyacrylamide or polyacrylonitrile. The terpolymer formation may be achieved either by reaction between such copolymers and glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride, or by conducting the polymerization of the comonomer mixture in the presence of glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride at conditions at which reaction between this chloride and carboxyl groups occurs. Alternatively, the terpolymers may also be obtained by reaction between 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammoniumchloride and copolymers of acrylamide and the alkali metal salts of acrylic acid such as sodium acrylate. While the reaction in accordance with the invention may be conducted with the polymer in solution, I have discovered that significant advantages are present in conducting the reaction of the polymer with the glycidyl trimethylammoniumchloride, while the polymer is substantially either in the solid phase or in a gelled state. The advantage of conducting the reaction in the solid or gell phase is particularly notable with high molecular weight polymers wherein amounts of only about 2 percent are tolerable in solution because of the high viscosity of solutions having larger amounts. With such systems, the large amount of water which must be handled oftentimes introduce severe practical problems.Additionally, because of the large amount of solvent water in the system, the efficiency of the glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride suffers i.e.relatively inordinate amounts to effect a suitable reaction. More particularly, in conducting the reaction in the solid phase, the polymer is preferably pretreated by swelling as with a small amount of water, or a suitable swelling agent such as an alcohol or DMSO subsequently, a concentrated solution either of glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride, or, in case of a polymer containing carboxylate units such as derived from sodium acrylate, of 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride is added and mixed therewith to yield the desired reaction product. This operation may also be conducted in the presence of an inert organic liquid, such as an alkane, kerosene, dipentene, terpenes, chlorobenzene, trichloroethane etc., which may function as a dispensing and heat transfer medium. The reaction proceeds effectively and yields substantially uniform products with minimum amounts of reactants to handle. The invention will be further described by the following specific examples. It will be understood, however, that although these examples may describe in detail certain preferred operating conditions of the invention, they are given primarily for purpose of illustration and the invention in its broader aspects is not limited thereto. EXAMPLE 1 Formation of a copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid by hydrolysis of polyacrylamide. 3000g of a 2 aqueous solution of polyacrylamide was mixed with 900g of a 35 aqueous NaOH solution and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. After this time the polymer was precipitated into 15 hydrochloric acid, filtered, washed with diluted HC1, extracted with methanol, and dried. The material contained 6.36tN which corresponds to 9.4 meq. COOH g. EXAMPLE 2 Terpolymer formation by reaction with glycidyl trimethylammonium chloride. 5g of the copolymer of Example 1 was dissolved in 125g of water at 700C. To this solution was added 42g of a solution prepared by dissolving l3.85g of glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride in 28g of water followed by addition of 0.41g of 37 HC1, and allowing to react for 2 hours before adding to the polymer solution. About 2 hours after mixing the two solutions the viscosity of the mixture had increased, stirring was continued for about 20 hours, then 150g of water was added. After cooling to room temperature the polymer was precipitated into methanol, filtered, extracated with methanol, and dried. The recovered polymer P1 contained 7.07 N and 3.1 C1. Based upon these analytical data, the composition of the terpolymer is represented by the general chemicalStructure IEMI7.1 wherein x, y and z have the following values x 0.345 y 0.582 and z 0.072. EXAMPLE 3 Terpolymer formation. The procedure employed inExample 2 was followed except that no HC1 was added to the glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride solution. Addition of HC1 in Example 2 had resulted in the forration of catalytic amounts of 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammoniumchloride . The resulting polymer P2 contained 7.3 N and 1.75 C1 which corresponds toStructure I shown in Example 2 with the following composition proportions x 0.366 y 0.596 z 0.038 EXAMPLE 4 Diluted aqueous solutions of the polymers of Exam ples 2 and 3 were used for the treatment of samples of municipal sludges and were found effective in dewatering such sludges.The efficacy is reflected in the values of the specific filtration resistance SFR and the dependence of these values on polymer dosage. Results of SFR tests are shown in Figure 1 with values of a conventional commercial flocculant CF . The values for polymers P1 and P2 exhibit not only considerably lower resistance to filtration but indicate also less sensitivity with respect to polymer dosage. EXAMPLE 5 9g of an acrylamide acrylic acid copolymer containing 12.64 of nitrogene 5 meq COOH g were dispersed in 270g methanol containing 18g of DMSO. The methanol was then recovered by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The polymer residue was then redispersed in a solution prepared by dissolving 14.09 of glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride epoxide equivlent 6.4 meq g in 250g of methanol. After removal of the methanol under reduced pressure at 250C the remaining solid mixture was heated to 650C for 20 hours. After that time it was extracted with isopropanol and dried in vacuum. The polymeric reaction product contained 48.1 carbn, 10.54 nitrogen, 8.59 chlorine. This composition corresponds according to the structure I to the following mole fractions x 60.1, y 11.46, z 28.5. EXAMPLE 6 The procedure employed was the same as that used inExample 5 except that the polymer glycidyltrimethylammoniumchloride mixture obtained after the removal of the methanol was heated to 650C for 20 hours as a suspension in 270g of n hexane. The polymeric reaction product contained 48.1 carbon, 11.03 nitrogen, and 8.24 chlorine. The corresponding mole fractions are x 63.7, y 9.6, and z 26.7. It will be apparent that various modifications may be effected without departing from the scope of the invention and the several details disclosed as illustrative are not to be construed as placing limitations on the invention except as may be recited in the appended claims.
