# Servo heads.

## Abstract
An arm assembly for a disk drive having a read write head and a servo head on the same Winchester arm as sembly is described. To eliminate the possibility of cross talk from the data head during the write mode, to the servo head, a Mumetal shield 24 is used to surround partially the servo head ferrite core 18 and coil 20 . The servo head is a composite structure having a non conducting body 16 and a thin ferrite core 18 so that the magnetic core volume to be shielded is minimized. In addition, a conducting layer and a ferramic plate is interposed between the data and servo heads to isolate these heads further.
