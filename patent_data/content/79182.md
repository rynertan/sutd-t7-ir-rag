# Improvements in or relating to the production of steel.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for the production of steel comprising the steps of providing a ferrous melt in a container, introducing iron ore into the container and separately introducing carbonaceous material into the melt, blowing an oxidising gas at the upper surface of the melt by means of an overhead lance, and injecting a stirring gas directly into the melt below the upper surface thereof.
