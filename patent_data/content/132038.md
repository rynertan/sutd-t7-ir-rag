## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN SPRAYABLE GERMICIDE MATERIALS This invention relates to sprayable solutions having virucidal and optionally also bactericidal activity on substrates onto which they are sprayed. They are especially, though not exclusively, intended for the disinfection of toilet seats, though they are also suitable for the disinfection of other surfaces that may carry infection. The prevalence of viral diseases such as herpes has become a matter of public concern, and people may be worried about contraction of the disease from toilets used by the public because the herpes II virus has life on an inert substrate of about 4 hours before it dies. It is an object of the invention to provide a sprayable disinfectant formulation that can be carried around and sprayed onto the substrate, and is virustatically or virucidally effective while drying without noticeable residue within an appropriate short time period. Accordingly the invention provides a spray container in which is a virustatically or a virucidally effective spray composition that when sprayed as a fine spray onto an impermeable substrate dries rapidly without visible residue and comprises at least one volatile virucidal material, a volatile odour masking perfume material and a volatile organic solvent. The compositions of the invention will preferably dry to the eye in a period of 30 90 seconds when sprayed onto a non absorbent substrate such as a lavatory seat and notwithstanding this short wet contact time are surprisingly effective against herpes II virus. A sufficient residue of the active constituents remains after drying to provide anti viral protection for up to 4 hours after spraying. Furthermore the compositions of the invention kill or inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Salmonella typhimurium, Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis.Furthermore, because they also include a compatible volatile perfume material the compositions of the invention perfume and freshen the air where they are used. The aldehydes that are incorporated into the above mentioned composition include formaldehyde which is preferred either for use alone or in admixture with a minor proportion of other aldehydes, but there could also be used as active ingredients acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and other volatile n alkyl aldehydes, glutaraldehyde, succinaldehyde, succinic dialdehyde, and other volatile aldehydes with antiviral activity, eg.aldehydes derived from essential oils such as citral.The concentrations of the active ingredients required will depend on the particular materials used. It is preferred, however, that at least two aldehyde materials should be present because they exhibit synergistic antiviral activity O.Thraenhart and E. Kuvert, Zentralbl Bakteriol Orig B Dec.75 161 3 , 209 232 .Formulations containing a major proportion of formaldehyde and a minor proportion of glutaraldehyde are preferred from the standpoints of virucidal effectiveness and volatility. A disinfectant formulation containing formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde is known under the name Tegodor, but that material also contains a quaternary ammonium surfactant that has residual activity. Such a material would not be acceptable for the present purpose because it would leave stains behind, and moreover it is intended to be applied diluted in water. The volatile odour masking material should share the volatility of the remainder of the composition, ie.it should substantially have vanished after 30 90 seconds. Materials that satisfy this criterion include materials having a lemon or lime odour such as lemon balm oil which has also been reported to have anti viral activity, see L.S. Kucera et al, Ann N.Y. Acad. Sci. 130, 474 82 1965 terpeneless lemon oil, citral and essential oils derived from other species of the citrus family. The volatile organic solvent may be methanol or ethanol, n propanol, or isopropanol. Where, as is preferred, the solvent comprises a major proportion of ethanol it may be in admixture with minor amounts of water and with denaturants such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or a bittering agent such as Bitrex denatronium benzoate . Bitrex may be present in denatured ethanol in an amount of about 10 micrograms per millilitre which is too low to leave Ã…a significant residue. The liquid may be filled into the final container of choice using conventional filling equipment and is designed to pe applied to inanimate objects as a fine spray. This can be achieved by means of a pump or aerosol actuator fitted to a glass, metal or plastics container.A lockable actuator for the container is also desirable and it is preferred that the spray should be directional. The invention will now be further described by way of illustration in the following Examples. Example 1A concentrate was made up by mixing together the following materials parts by volume Formaldehyde solution 37 w v 54Glutaraldehyde 25 w v 40Terpeneless lemon oil BPC 2Methylated spirits qsp 100m1 From the above concentrate samples were made up by dilution of the concentrate with the following quantities of methylated spirits Identity ml concentrate l00ml A 10 B 5 C 2.5 D 0.5 E 0.2 F 0.1The above six formulations were filled into a pump action spray bottle and were effective against virus on lavatory seats as described below.Example 2The pH of the above formulations was adjusted to 8 8.5 with imidazole or other compatible alkaline material, after which the formulations were introduced into aerosol spray packs using carbon dioxide as propellant. The packed material exhibited satisfactory storage stability by reason of the carbon dioxide present in the container.But when the contents were sprayed onto a substrate, the sprayed material was alkaline, and effective against virus thereon.Example 3The above mentioned formulations were adjusted to pH 5 and were packed into an aerosol container using dichlorodifluoromethane as propellant.Example 4The following tests were carried out to demonstrate the activity of the formulations of Example 1 a Spraying onto an impermeable surface The virus employed was a locally isolated strain of herpes virus hominis HVH type 2 which was grown in a monolayer culture of MRC 5 cells to a titre of 10 5.5 TCD 50. The MRC cells Flow Laboratories Limited had been grown in Eagles MEM Wellcome Reagents Ltd supplemented by 108 calf serum which was used for all maintenance M.M. . The transport medium employed was Hanks solution with 10 bovine albumen. For the tests, 2Q oz screw copper sterile glass replicate bottles medical flats were rinsed with 1 Tween 20, drained and allowed to dry. Into sets of five of the replicate bottles was placed 0.1 ml of the herpes virus hominis culture of TCD 50. Then sample materials A F either neat or diluted as indicated below were sprayed into each bottle using 4 puffs of a Roger s ENT spray 1 puff was about 0.04 ml of solution . The bottles were left at room temperature for 10 minutes, after which the sprayed surface was swabbed and the swab was placed in a bottle containing 1 ml of transport medium. Control bottles were inoculated with human herpes virus in the same way but were sprayed with sterile saline. They were then after treated as described above. 0.2 ml of transport medium from the bottles under test were introduced into each of five tubes containing 1.0 ml of the culture of MRC 5 cells. After 4 hours the transport medium was replaced with 1.0 ml of fresh maintenance medium. The cells were examined daily for a week for evidence of growth.

EXAMPLE 5 EVALUATION OF THE VIRUCIDAL EFFICACY OF ANTIVIRAL SPRAYS R2 1 013 and LYSOL AGAINST HERPES VIRUS HOMINIS TYPE 2 A recently isolated strain of Herpes virus hominis Herpes simplex virus Type 2 HGV derived from a case of genital herpes, was grown in tissue culture to a titre of 107 ml, and was diluted to 1000 TCD 50 ml in PBS. The virus inoculum was sprayed over 7.5 x 10cm glass slides and over 2.5 cm2 pieces of filter paper. Approximately 0.5 ml of inoculum was used for the slides and 0.1 ml for the papers. The 24 slides and 24 pieces of filter paper were dried and then sprayed for one second with the antiviral material A of Example 1 called AVS and the same number for the same time with Lysol spray. The samples were kept at 180C for various periods 5, 15, 45 and 120 minutes . The glass surfaces were rubbed with cotton swabs moistened in tissue culture growth medium containing 40 calf serum. The swabs were placed in 2 ml of the same medium which after agitation was centrifuged at 50,000g in a Spinco refrigerated ultracentrifuge for two hours.The deposit was reconstituted with tissue culture maintenance medium and inoculated into a series of VeroCell cultures. Six tubes were used for each slide.Cultures were examined daily for two weeks before being declared negative. The filter paper squares were macerated in tissue culture media with 40 calf serum and the resultant fluid was treated as that from the slides. Slides and paper sprayed with virus but not with antiviral sprays were used as controls. A similar experiment was done but this time treating the slides only with antiviral spray before adding HSV. The treated slides were kept in batches of twelve for periods of 5, 15, 45 and 24 hours at 180C. HSV was sprayed on as before and sampling was made after 5, 15 minutes and one hour. Untreated slides were used as controls. Further treatment was as described previously.

However, although all the AVS had disappeared to the eye it was unexpectedly found in this experiment that the effects of the AVS material according to the invention were more persistent than that of Lysol . The second series of experiments showed that virus was effectively killed when the impervious surface had been pretreated for periods up to a day. The AVS appeared to have a more long lasting action than Lysol. These tests were made extremely difficult by the extreme toxicity of Lysol in particular for tissue culture cells. A preliminary experiment showed that when Lysol spray was diluted 1 10 in saline before use it became virtually non virucidal. This did not happen with AVS.

They were sprayed onto an inert surface of plastics material 20 cms square.The surface used for the purposes of the test was a formica laminate and the test area was sprayed in orthogonal directions to produce an even saturated film over the test area. These conditions enable an evaporation rate to be measured, but represent a significantly higher coverage rate than would be expected in normal use.The results obtained were as follows EMI10.1 tb Propellant SEP Amount SEP Drying SEP Still SEP Air tb SEP dispensed SEP time SEP Drying SEP Rate SEP 230C tb Carbon SEP Dioxide SEP 1.4 SEP g SEP 5.5 SEP mins SEP 4mg s tb Hydrocarbon tb propellant tb upright SEP spray SEP 1.2 SEP g SEP 2 SEP mins SEP lOmg s tb Hydrocarbon tb propellant tb inverted SEP spray tb SEP valve SEP i SEP 1.7 SEP g SEP 3.5 SEP mins SEP 9mg s tb In the above tests the inverted spray was carried out using an aerosol container fitted with an appropriately adapted spray valve without dip tube. Such aerosol containers are available commercially. It will be noted that the drying rate obtained with a liquid hydrocarbon propellant was more than twice the comparable rate using carbon dioxide as propellant. The reason is believed to be that the hydrocarbon propellant gives rise to a smaller drop size that enables a continuous liquid film to be developed at lower weights of composition per unit area. Note that the amount dispensed includes both the concentrate and the propellant and the proportion of propellent in the C02 propelled sample was much higher than that in the hydrocarbon propelled sample. The above three samples were sprayed onto the surface again to produce a film that sparingly covered but did not saturate the surface. In each instance drying to the eye occurred in about 1 minute.
