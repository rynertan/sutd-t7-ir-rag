# IMAGE SCANNING READ OUT METHOD

## Abstract
A sheet carrying an image stored therein is scanned by a light beam emitted by a light source. Light which is obtained by the scanning of the sheet and which carries the image is detected by use of a photomultiplier. When the level of output current of the photomultiplier becomes higher than a predetermined standard level, the intensity of the light beam is decreased so that the level of the output current of the photomultiplier does not exceed the predetermined standard level, thereby preventing the photomultiplier from being broken by light of high intensity.
