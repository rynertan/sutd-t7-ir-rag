# Method of and apparatus for monitoring a rotary kiln.

## Abstract
A problem that can occur with a large rotary kiln assembly is that it can move out of position or seals can become defective, making an escape of materials possible. The present invention provides transducers 10, 15 for detecting movement of the rotary kiln itself or part of a seal assembly secured thereto relative to an inlet outlet arrange ment of the kiln assembly or a part of a seal arrangement secured thereto and also means whereby the condition of the seals can be monitored by following changes in the pressure or flow rate of a purge gas. If the rotary kiln 2 should move out of alignment, then corrective action can be taken. If the seals should leak, then they are changed. A record of kiln movement is provided and if movement is excessive, an alarm 20 is sounded.
