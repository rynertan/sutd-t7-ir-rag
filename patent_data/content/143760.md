# ARRANGEMENT FOR A LARGE SURFACE CONTROL PANEL

## Abstract
A large surface control panel 1 is made of wood. At least at parts of its extent in the plane of the panel the control panel exhibits a material thickness of 1.5 6.0 mm. At least said parts the control panel is constructed from three sheets of wood positioned immediately adjacent one to the other, with the adjacent sheets of wood being so arranged that the principal directions of the grain of the wood run cross wise to each other.
