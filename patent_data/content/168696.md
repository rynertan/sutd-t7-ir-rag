# Eddy current distance signal formation apparatus.

## Abstract
A multiplier 15 is connected to one secondary coil 14b of a pair of secondary coils in an eddy current sensor 14 . A difference between two inputs to a differential amplifier 16 is adjusted to be zero when an object 22 to be measured is not present. Thereafter, the sensor 15 is located near a steel plate 22 to be measured, and an output corresponding to a difference between the inputs to the differential amplifier 16 is added by a feedback amplifier 12 to an output from an os cillator 10 , thereby obtaining an eddy current distance signal output eO .
