# Apparatus for measuring film thickness.

## Abstract
An elliptically polarized monochromatic light 1 is obtained from monochromatic light select unit 20 and is reflected at an interface 3 between an objective film 1 and substrate 2 . An extinction wavelength of the reflected light R , when the amount thereof detected at photodetector 40 becomes zero, is detected at control unit 30 and the true thickness of the film 1 is calculated from the detected extinction wavelength.
