# Amplifier arrangement.

## Abstract
A high efficiency class G type amplifier comprises a first transistor T₁ , whose collector is connected to a first supply voltage V₁ via a first diode D₁ and a second transistor T₂ , which is connected in series with said first transistor and which has its collector connected to a second supply voltage V₂ . The series arrangement of a second D₂ , a third D₃ and a fourth diode D₄ is arranged between the bases of the first and the second transistor T₁, T₂ , the fourth diode D₄ being poled in a direction opposite to that of the second D₂ and the third diode D₃ . By means of the series arrangement of a first resistor R₁ and the emitter collector path of a first current source transistor T₄ the second supply voltage V₂ is connected to the anode 4 of the fourth diode D₄ . The junction point 5 between the first resistor R₁ and the current source transistor T₄ is connected to the output 2 of the arrangement by means of a capacitor C₁ . By means of such an arrangement the output 2 can be driven to a voltage substantially equal to the second voltage V₂ .
