# Method for recording and erasing optical information.

## Abstract
A read write optical disk system for performing high density recording, reproduction and erasing of information signals by utilizing reversible structural changes between the crystalline and amorphous states of a chalcogenide glass film or the like and a recording, reproducing and erasing method therefor. Whereby, during the period of recording and erasing, respectively, an exposed film area is first heated beyond its melting point to obtain a random state of its atomic arrangement and the rate of cooling from this melted state is controlled so as to obtain a recorded state or an erased state. This method is realized in the system by arranging a plurality of laser spots C₁, C₂ of different intensities and lengths in proximity to each other on the same track thereby ensuring high quality erasing involving no danger of any incomplete erasure.
