# Apparatus for controlling the frequency of a voltage controlled oscillator.

## Abstract
In an automatic frequency control AFC circuit 10 of a video tape recorder, a charge pump circuit 13, 14 is used to form a control signal for a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 5 included in the AFC circuit by phase comparing 12 a horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC from a video signal with an output of the VCO 5. An AFC identification circuit 24 can be added to the AFC circuit 10 to make locking in of the circuit 10 smooth and fast when the AFC circuit is out of a lock in range.
