# Local annealing treatment for cube on edge grain oriented silicon steel.

## Abstract
A process for improving the core loss of cube on edge grain oriented silicon steel. At some point in its routing after at least one stage of cold rolling and before the final high temperature anneal during which secondary grain growth occurs, the electrical steel is subjected to local annealing across its rolling direction creating bands of enlarged primary grains. These bands of enlarged primary grains regulate the growth of the secondary cube on edge grains in the intermediate unannealed areas of the electrical steel strip during the final high temperature anneal, and are themselves ultimately consumed by the secondary grains, providing a cube on edge grain oriented electrical steel with smaller secondary grains and reduced core loss.
