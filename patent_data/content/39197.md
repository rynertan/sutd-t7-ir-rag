## Description
DISTILLATION APPARATUS This invention relates to an improved process and apparatus for the distillation of liquids containing a salt or other low volatility solute, and in particular for the distillation of sea water to produce fresh water. Distillation is a process for vapourising a liquid and then condensing the vapour. It is useful in separating volatile portions of a mixture from nonvolatile or less volatile components. One field of distillation which is of particular importance is that of obtaining pure water from brackish water or brine. For the purposes of this disclosure, the terms brackish water and brine are used to refer to an unsaturated salt solution including se.a water. It is known from US Patent Specification No 3,340,186 Weyl to provide apparatus for the distillation of a feed of aqueous liquid containing a salt or other low volatility solute in which the feed liquid flows in contact with a porous hydrophobic membrane such that water vapour is permitted to pass through the me mbrane and condenses to form a distillate on the opposite side of the membrane An object of the present invention is to provide an improved dis.tillation apparatus and process.

Fig. 1A is a cross s ectional view of the still of Fig.1 taken along the line 1A 1A thereof.

Fig. 3 is a schematic drawing of the apparatus used in Example 1 hereinbel.ow. Fig. 4 is a schematic. drawing of a two stage membrane still employing the principles of this invention and wherein the latent heat of condensation in the first stage is used to parti.ally preheat the feed in the second stage. Figs. 5, 6 and are schematics of further embodiments of the principles of this invention. The process comprises feeding a liquid containing salt or other low volatility solute to one side of a porous, hydrophobic membrane, maintaining a driving force for evaporation of distill.ate from the feed across the membrane, and collecting the distillate on the other side of the membrane while maintaining both liquid feed and liquid distillate in.intimate contact with the membrane on their respective sides thereo f. By this process, distillation occurs across the microporous membrane by molecular diffusion of distillate vapour from the liquid containing salt.The microporous membrane is made of a sufficiently non wetting matrix material such that both the liquid containing salt and the liquid distillate are repelled and prevented from entering the micropores.Efficient distillation of brackish water or brine to pure water is achieved. The preferred membrane material is expanded, microporous polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE .Multiple stage distillation is also provided. The critical component of all the inventive configurations described herein is the microporous, nonwetting membrane. The non wetting characteristic is practically measured quantitatively as liquid entry pressure. Liquid entry pressure is the lowest. pressure differential across the membrane which is required to force liquid into and through the membrane. For a membrane to be considered non wetting, according to the principles herein, the liquid entry pressure must be a positive value ie the liquid must not be absorbed into the membrane spontaneously. For the purposes of this invention, the liquid entry pressure must be high enough to prevent liquid from entering the pores of the membrane under normal operating conditions and preferably during accidental pressure increases. Liquid entry pressure is a function of pore size of the microporous material, surface energy or surface tension of the liquid, and surface energy of the solid material comprising the matrix of the membrane. Smaller pores, higher liquid surface tensions, and lower solid surface energies all lead to higher liquid entry pressures. For simple microstructure geometries such as a membrane having pores which are straight and cylindrical, the liquid entry pressure can be calcul.ated from a knowledge of the diameter of the largest pore and the surface energies of the liquid and the matrix. However, most microporous membranes have either irregularly shaped pores or an irregular, interconnecting pore space. For these microstructures a direct measurement of liquid entry pressure must be made.From a measurement of liquid entry pressure, a theoretical pore size can be expressed in terms of the diameter of a straight, cylindri cal pore which would have the same liquid entry pressure. For the purposes of this invention, two liquid entry pressures are pertinent the liquid entry pressure of the feed liquid and that of the distillate. The porosity of the membrane is preferred to be high for two reasons. First, more porous membranes generally have a lower thermal conductivity because of the low conductivity of the gases filling the void spaces. It is desired that the thermal conductivity be low so that heat is retarded from being conducted across the membrane.Second, more highly porous membranes generally allow higher rates of diffusion of distillate vapours because of the higher diffusivities through gases as compared to solids. For this same reason, it is necessary that the microporous membrane be of the open pore type rather than of a closed cell type. Although the thermal conductivity for highly porous materials is only fractionally affected by the thermal conductivity of the matrix material., it is still desirable that the matrix material have a low thermal conductivity. The pr eferred material for the hydrophobic porous membrane of this invention is expanded, microporous PTFE.This material. is commercially available from W L Gore BR Associates Inc , Elkton, Maryland, USA. These membranes are available in widths up to 1.5 metres and in various porosities and thicknesses. Typical membranes are about 0.005 inches .075mm thick and have over 80 open pore space. They are excellent thermal insulators and allow a high diffusional flow of water vapour, with rates of about 300 grams o f water vapour per square metre per hour for each mm Hg water vapour pressure difference across them.These membranes are hydrophobic and can withstand over 25 psi water pressure without liquid water penetrating through them. Therefore, they effectively prevent passage of salt water and liquid distillate but allow water vapour to flow through readily. Another suitable porous membrane is microporous polypropylene, commercially available from Celanese Corporation under the trademark Celgard. In addition to high vapour permeability, three other properties of the membrane are believed to be necessary in combination. They are low thermal conductivity high water entry pressure and thinness of membrane. Low thermal conductivity of the membrane reduces loss of heat by conduction so that the heat flux across the membrane is largely that which is carried by the latent heat of the distillate vapour in evaporating and condensing. High water entry pressure allows intimate contact of the distilling and distilled liquid with the membrane, making spacers and stagnant air layers unnecessary so that the diffusion path is short. For the same reason, ie shortening the diffusion path, thin membranes are desirable. The invention also provides devices and processes for distillatioD where the latent heat of condensation can be efficiently used and re used to volatilize additional brackish water. By suitable arr angement of counter current flow of brine and rapid removal of pure water distillate, a continuous latent heat conserving distillation can be carried out with a single layer of a porous hydrophobic membra.ne coupled with a non porous liquid impermeable film, Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of such a device and process.Fresh cool brine 2 enters a chamber 4 through inlet 3 and flows along a thin polyethylene film 6 exiting at outlet 8, passes through a solar or other heater 10, then returns through inlet 12 to chamber 5 and flows in intimate contact with porous hydrophobic membrane 1 rl, and finally the concentrated br ine is discarded at outlet 16. Water vapour flows from the hot brine adjacent the porous hydrophobic film through this film and condenses against the cool polyethylene film 6 so that pure water is collected in the space 18 between the polyethylene film and the hydrophobic membrane. The pure water is withdrawn at. orifice 20.This distillate collector is continuously drained to keep the distillate layer as thin as possible so that the latent heat of condensation is readily transferred to the brine in contact with the polyethylene film. Such drainage may be facilitated by maintaining the brine pressures at higher levels than that in the distillate receptacle 18. Fig. 1A is a schematic diagram of the cross section of the still shown in Fig. 1 taken along the lines 1A. 1A thereof. While cross sectional configuration is not critical to the invention, Fig. 1A showing a circular stil.l cross section is provided for completeness.Therein, brine passes through chamber 4 in contact with nonporous film 6 and enters outlet 8 passing through the heater and entering inlet 12 into chamber 5 flowing in contact with microporous membrane 14. Distillate collects in and is withdrawn from space 18 between thme nonporous film and the microporous membrane. In a completely insulated device, heat is lost primarily in the distillate and in the concentrated brine being withdrawn from the system. The replacement for this heat loss is supplied by the solar or other heater 10. The single microporous layer operates as a continous latent heat conserving Still. At. entrance 12 of the hot brine, the incoming brine has been heated by transfer of sensible heat and latent. heat of condensation through the polyethylene separator film. Due to the heater 10, there is a temperature difference and therefore a substantial water vapour pressure difference across membrane 14 so that vapour flows through the porous membrane 1 4 and condenses in receptacle 18. As the hot brine flows toward exit 16, it cools by evaporation and conduction through the porous film, but the incoming brine adjacent to it in chamber 4 entering at inlet 3 is always cooler so that the distillation process continues.Such membrane 14 is thin and very permeable to water vapour, a substantial flow of water vapour occurs even with small temperature differences and therefore small water vapour.pressure differences. Heat input to maintain temperature differences across the membrane can be by solar radiation, combustion of fossil fuels, heat exchange with proce ss cooling water, nuclear energy, or any other conceivable heat energy source. A two effect embodiment of this invention which advantageously employs the differenc e in temperature of two separate masses of salt water, one at 270C and one at i80C, to produce fresh water i s shown in Fig. 2. The particular temperatures referred to are illustrative only.Warm brine at 270C enters the upper stage 30 at inlet 34, passing through chamber 36. Water vapour evaporates downward in this illustration through porous hydrophobic membrane 38 and condenses in the space 40 formed by the membrane 38 and a polyethylene. film 42. Distillate flows out through an outlet 44. By the time the salt water reaches the outlet 46, it is asmewhat more concentrated and has cooled to about 21 Cv This spent brine is drained away and discarded. The temperature differential across the membrane is maintained by a counter current flow of brine from t he second source which enters at inlet 48 at a temperature of 180C and passes through chamber 50 of upper stage 30.By the time it reaches outlet 52, it has warmed to about 240C. This 240C salt.watzer passes through inlet 54 into stage 32 similar to them one above it. From chamber 56, water vapour passes, through porous hydrophobic membrane 58, condenses in space 60 formed by the membrane 58 and the polyethylene film 62, and is drained out at outlet 64.. The concentrated and cooled brine passes out through outlet 66 at a temperature of 210C and is discarded. The counter current flow of cooling brine enters at inlet 68, passes through chamber 70, and is drained off through outlet 72 at a temperature of 210C. This embodiment of the invention may be utilized to produce fresh water by use of oceanic thermal gradients or gradients between sea water and nearby salt water ponds which are heated by solar energy. If such ponds are covered by an evaporation retarding layer of oil, they can become significantly warmer than sea water. The number of stages practical varies from one to many, depending on the difference in temperatures of the two masses of salt water. Cross sectional configuration in Fig . 2 is again not critical and a separate figure showing cross section has been omitted for brevity. ExamPle 1 Apparatus for carrying out this example is illustrated schematically in Fig. 3. Therein plastic cup 80 wÅas partially filled with an ice water mixture 82, and a .001 inch thick microporous PTFE membrane 84 having approximately 80 open pore space, supplied by W L Gore BR Associates Inc, under the trademark GORE TEX, was heatsealed to the lip of the cup. The cup was weighed then inverted into a 4X sodium chloride in water solution 86 which was maintained a.t 500G by means of an electrical resistance heater 88 and which was circulated by stirrer 90 so as to make temper atures within the solution as uniform as. possible..After a few minutes of contact between the microporous membrane and the salt solution, the cup was re weighed.. The following values were obtained Trial I Trial IIArea of membrane 33.2 cm2 33.2 cm2Time of exposure 3 minutes 2 minutesWeight before 84.35 grams 81.84 grams Weight after 87.37 grams 84.28 gramsWeight gain 3.02 grams 2.44 gramsRate of 437,000 grams 529,000 grams Distillation m2 day m2 day The water ice mixtures 82 were tested following each trial for chloride i on by adding silver nitrate solution.The distillate in each case was pure and uncontaminated. This example is illustrative of the extremely high rates of distillation which are possible when both the heated salt water and the cool distillate are in direct contact with the hydrophobic porous film. Example 2 The utilization of a multiple st age still configuration to utilize the latent heat of condensation was tested by means of the two stage circular membrane still, 5 1 2 in diameter, depicted in Fig. 4. The still is a circular cylindrical assembly of spacing and clamping rings mounted upon a base to effect desired spacing and clamping of the needed membranes. Each such ring had a 5 1 2 I.D.In the still, aluminium ring 102 having a height of 3 8 inch was mounted upon plastic ring 104 having a height of 3 8 inch, in turn mounted upon plastic rings 106 through 112, each having heights of 3 16 inch, the assembly. resting on base plate 114 Cold tap water at a temperature of about 150C was passed below and incontact with base plate 114 at a rate of 570 mi min, entering through inlet 116 and exiting through outlet 118 of base 120. Radiation from a 275 watt sunlamp 100 passed downward as shown through 1 mil thick fluorinated ethylene propylene FEP glazing 122, and t mil thick FEP vapour barrier 124, and a brine layer 126 approximately 3 8 thick of 3.3 salinity.Beneath this brine and 14 cm below the sunlamp, a 44 mil thick GORE TEX microporousPTFE membrane dyed black 128 absorbed the radiation and became heated, thereby heating the brine above it. Water vapour from the brine 126 evaporated downward through theGORE TEX membrane 128. and condensed against cooler FEP film 130, collecting in the pocket 132. Heat from this condensation, as well as some conducted heat, passed through the FEP film 130 and into the brine layer of the second stage 134, also approximately 3 8 thick and of 3.3 salinity.Water vapour from this brine layer 134 then diffused downward t hrough a 44 mil thick GOR.E TEX microporous PTFE membrane. of the second stage 136 as shown and condensed against.lowest FEP film 138, collecting in the space 140. Cold tap water at about 150C was passed through the cavity 142 at a rate of 570 ml min to facilitate the flow of heat through the still. After two hours, the temper atures of the upper brine layer 126 was measured using thermocouple 144 to be 530C, and the lower brine layer 134 had achieved a temperature of 370C , measured by thermocouple 146. The still was disassembled and 47 ml of distillate was recovered from the upper distillate pocket 132 and 30 ml from the lower distillate pocket 140. The distillate when boiled off left no measurable residue, and was thus not contaminated by the salt. A separate measurement was made of the initial rate of temperature increase in the upper brine layer. From the known m ass of brine, it was concl.uded that heat is absorbed under the. above conditions by the upper brine layer at a rate of 18 Kcal per hour. If efficiency is defined as the ratio of energy used to evaporate water to the energy absorbed by the sy stem,. then Efficiency 77 ml x .54 Kcal ml x 100 116 18 K al hr x 2hr where the heat of volatilation and condensation is taken as .54 Kcal ml. Only a still which makes use of the latent heat of condensation can achieve efficiencies greater than 100 . Many improvements could be made on this design. The number of stages, could be increased by using thinner porous membranes and by decreasing the thickness of the brine layers, so that the temperature drop per stage would be decreased. The distillate could be drained off as it is produced, and the brine made to flow in order to prevent excessive salt concentration. Floating embodiments of this invention, whether of single or multiple stages, could utilize the cooling effect of the sea or of sea water ponds to fill the function of the heat sink 142. A single stage membrane still of this type would have application for survival at sea. One such improvement is now described. One requirement of an economically useful desalination device is that it produce a reasonable amount of water per unit area of working surface. For membrane distillation, this can be quantified as the volume of fresh water produced per unit area of membrane per unit time for a given difference in vapour pressure across the membrane. We call this quantity the flC factor11 expressed in gallons of water per day per square foot per torr vapour pressure difference. The productivity per square foot is then expressed as the C factor multiplied by the vapour pressure driving force across the membrane. This driving force is calculated from the bulk fluid temperatures on either side of the membrane and the salinity of the salt water on the warm side.Since only the bulk fluid temperatures are readily measurable and are not identical to the temperatures at the membrane fluid interfaces, the C factor will vary for different devices and for different conditions even though the type of membrane used may be the same. Previous membrane distillation patents have claimed multi stage 11sandwich11 configurations as the most effective design. These devices, however, are not highly productive and achieve only low C fact ors. This is largely due to the poor mixing of the liquids within chambers in such devices, which leads to thermal stratification. For instance, the C factor of the examples of US Patent No 3,340,186 are only about .005 gallons per square foot per day per torr of water vapour pressure difference across the membrane. We shall see below that much higher C factors are possible with the devices of this invention. A second requirement for usefulness where the cost of heat energy is high is that a small amount of heat generates a large amount of fresh water. This is commonly expressed as the performance ratio of the device. The performance ratio of a device is the amount of heat required to evaporate a unit quantity of water divided by the amount required to produce a unit quantity of water with the device. For example, the heat of vapourisation of water is about 565 calories per gram at 550C. A device tha t re uses this heat might have a performance ratio of 20, thus requiring only about 28 calories of heat input per gram of distillate produced. All distillation devices are limited in achieving high performance ratios by the available difference in temperature of the heat source and heat sink.In membrane distillation designs using stacked configurations, the performance ratio is a function of the number of stages which can be interposed between the heat source and heat sink. The poor mixing of salt water in such designs leads to a large temperature drop across each stage. Since the number of stages possible is the available temperature difference divided by the average temperature drop across each stage, it follows that the performace ratio achievable with the stacked configuration cannot be high. High performance ratios can be achieved by the design depicted in Fig. 1 Here the performance ratio is also dependent upon the temperature difference between the hot brine entering the still at 12 and the cold brine entering at 3. However, the temperature difference across the membrane can be as small as 20C without causing productivity to drop to an uneconomical level. It is this small temperature difference across the membrane that accounts for the high performance ratios achieved with the design show in Fig. 1. The salt water in channels 4 and 5 flows relatively quickly in counter current directions and is well mixed within each channel.The good mixing and counter current flow, together with the rapid removal of distillate from the space between the membrane 14 and impermeable sheet 16, make this small temperature drop across.the membrane operationally feasible. It is important that a still of the design depicted in Fig. 1 be well insulated. One way to decrease the need for insulation would be to run a number of stills in parallel so that they share extern l walls. Figure 5 shows how this might be done with three stills. .Numeration is the same as in Fig. 1. The walls 100 and 101 in Fig. 5 can be eliminated, which leads to the embodiment depicted in Fig. 6. Another way to minimize the need f or insulation, increase the packing density of the membrane, and contain the pressure necessary to provide high flow necessary for good mixing is to create a three chambered spiral. as shown in Fig 7. Here again the numeration is the same as in Fig. 1. Since the cold salt water enters at the outside, there is no need for insulation around the perimeter. A still of this. design was built using .0081 half hard aluminium as the impermeable material 6. The salt water flow channels. 4 and 5 were maintained at a thickness of 1 8 by use of 1 81 plastic tubing spacers, and were about 24 feet long. The assembled still was 1211 in diameter and 611 high The top and bottom were potted with epoxy sealant, and urethane foam sealed. behind the outer headers 3, 16 and 20 at 110 and 111. Four percent. sodium chloride solution at a temperature of 118.40C flowed in 3 at a rate of two gallons per minute, spiralled into the center, and exited at 8 at a temperature of 56.5 C. This water was heated externally by a resistance heater to 59.7 C and pumped into 12, whence it spiraled outward through channel 5. .A portion of it evaporated, the distillate condensing and collecting between the membranes 14 and the aluminium sheets 6 and draining out at 20, aided by a 16 Hg vacuum applied at 20. In five minutes, 400 millilitres .10567 gallon of distillate were produced, containing .02 200 ppm sodium chloride. as determined by evaporation. This indicated a small leakage around the seals .The portion of the salt water which did not evaporate exited at 16 at a temperature of 50.6 C. Since the still contained 18.1 square feet o f membrane and the average vapour pressure difference across the membrane weas about 12 mm Hg, the average C factor was 0.137 gallons per ft2 per day per torr. This is 27 times the C factor achieved in US Patent 3,340,186. The performance ratio was 1.85.. Since the rise in temperature from 3 to 8 was 56.5 48.4 8..1 C,. we can expect that had the still been longer and the brine heated so that the rise were 7000, the performance ratio would have been approximately 700C 8.10C x 1.85 16. This is better energ y efficiency than that achieved by any current commercial distillation process. While the invention has been described in detail in connection with certain examples, features and preferred embodiments, the foregoing is deemed. to be illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Since modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled. in the art, the invention is not to be considered as limited to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordin gly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to which fall within the scope of the invention as claimed..
