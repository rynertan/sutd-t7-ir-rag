# Method for producing glass preform for optical fiber.

## Abstract
A method for producing a glass preform for use in the fabrication of an optical fiber, which comprises adding fluorine to a soot preform in an atmosphere comprising a fluorine containing compound at a temperature at which the soot preform is in the porous state and then keeping or insert ing it in an atmosphere containing a fluorine containing com pound at a higher temperature to vitrify it to form a glass preform, from which glass preform, an optical fiber homogeneously containing fluorine is fabricated.
