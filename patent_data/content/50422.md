# Method and apparatus for making modular electrical harnesses including wire holding head.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for making modular elec trical harnesses in which, in a first operating zone. a leading end of a wire 15 extending from a wire supply 16 is terminated in a preselected terminal of a row of terminals in a first connector part 11 further wire 15 is fed from the supple to form a trailing loop 17 and the trailing end of the wire 15 is terminated in a pre selected terminal of a row of terminals in a second connector part 11 in end to end relation with the first connector part 11 and severed from the supply 16 . The connector parts 11, 11 are fed in end to end relation along a path 10 extending through several such operat ing zones progressively to connect all the preselected terminals of the first connector part 11 to all pre selected terminals of the second connector parts 11 by respective wire loops 17, 17 . A wire holding head 14, 14 , in each zone provides an operable loop form ing track 94, 101 .
