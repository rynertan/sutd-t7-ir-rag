# Liquid jet recording head.

## Abstract
A liquid jet recording head has a liquid passage com municated to the discharging outlet of the liquid provided on a substrate surface, said passage being formed by subjecting a layer of a resin composition curable with an active energy ray to a predetermined pattern exposure with the use of said ac tive energy ray to thereby form a cured region of said resin composition and removing the uncured region from said layer, said resin composition comprising the component i shown below and at least one of the components ii and iii shown below i a graft copolymerized polymer comprising a trunk chain composed mainly of structural units derived from at leastone monomer selected from the group consisting of alkyl methacrylates, acrylonitrile and styrene, having gfaft chains composed mainly of structural units derived from at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of A hydroxyl containing acrylic monomers, B amino or alkyla mino containing acrylic monomers, C carboxylic containing acrylic or vinyl monomers, D N vinylpyrrolidone or its deri vatives, E vinylpyridine or its derivetives and F acrylamide derivatives represented by the following general formula I
