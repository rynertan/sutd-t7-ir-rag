## Description
A biologically pure culture of strain FERM P No. 5141,IFO 14093, and a process for producing an intracellular component herefromThe invention relates to a biologically pure culture of strain FERM P No. 5141, IFO 14093, and a process for producing an intracellular component herefrom.Since bacterial cells are smaller in size than yeast or fungal cells, they are difficult to collect from a culture, so they are usually collected by centrifugation rather than by filtration. But the rate of sedimentation of cells in centrifugation is proportional to the square of the cell diameter see Sekiyu Hakko, Petroleum Fermentation, p. 102, 1970, Saiwai Publishing Company , so the recovery of bacterial cells from the fermentation broth is more expensive than recovery of yeast and fungal cells and is very disadvantageous in an industrial operation. According to the estimate by Daniel I.C. Wang, the cost of recovery of bacteria is about 3.8 times the cost of recovery of yeast see Chemical Engineering, Vol. 15, p. 99, 1968 .Therefore, several methods have been proposed for recovery of bacterial cells and among them is flocculation of cells with a flocculant such as ferric chloride, calcium chloride or polymeric flocculant, or modifying the cell protein to an easily collectable form by heating or treatment with a strong acid or base. These techniques are effective when the cell is not the end product, but when the cell per se or the components in the cell are the end product, they are not effective because the flocculant contaminates the product, or the components in the cell are denaturated.Acetate kinase, one example of the endoenzymes, is an enzyme widely used for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate, a source of biological energy, from acetylphosphoric acid and adenosine diphosphate, or for de termination of the acetic acid levels in foods. Acetate kinase is usually obtained as a purified enzyme fromEscherichia coli see Journal of Biological Chemistry, 211, p. 737, 1954, and Methods in Enzymology, 1, p. 591 , but the acetate kinase isolated from Escherichia coli is very unstable and not suitable for use on an industrial scale.Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 25088 77 the term OPI as used herein means a published unexaminedJapanese patent application describes a process for producing a highly heat resistant i.e., heat stable acetate kinase from a thermophiic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus.Polynucleotide phosphorylase is used for synthesis of ribo homopolymers or copolymers of nucleotide, à variety of analog polynucleotides, oligonucleotides having a fixed base arrangement, and for decomposition of RNA. The enzyme also finds much use in the study of the structure and physical properties of nucleic acids. Polynucleotide phosphorylase is conventionally obtained as an extract from Micrococcus luteus see Procedures in Nucleic AcidResearch, Vol. 2, p. 896, 1971 , but the polynucleotide phosphorylase isolated from that microorganism is so labile that it is unsuitable for use even in laboratorysclae research, to say nothing of use on an industrial scale. Seikagaku Biochemistry , Vol. 47, p. 738 1975 describes a method of producing a highly heat stable, heat resistant polynucleotide phosphorylase from a thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus, and NucleicAcids Research, Vol. 3, p. 219 1976 describes a method of producing the same enzyme from a thermophilic bacteriumBacillus stearothermophilus.Maleate dehydrogenase which produces oxaloacetic acid from malic acid using nicotinamide adenine nucleotide as a coenzyme has recently been much in demand as an enzyme for use in clinical diagnosis. This enzyme is usually obtained as a purified extract from animal tissues, say, bovine heart see Methods in Enzymology, Vol.13, p. 99 , but maleate dehydrogenase isolated from animal tissues is labile and isnot easy to handle.Therefore, a supply of a stable maleate dehydrogenase was desired, and the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol.242, p. 1548, 1967 and Biochemical Journal, Vol.177, p. 441, 1979 have described a methode of producing a highly heat stable, heat resistant maleate dehydrogenase from a thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus.Glucokinase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase are used to measure the glucose or hexokinase level in the body fluid, which is an important factor in clinical analysis. They are also used to determine the glucose or fructose level in foods which is also an important parameter to know in the manufacture of invert sugar. However, known glucokinase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase are labile, too see Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 42, pp. 6 39, 1975 ed. by W.A. Wood, and Advances inEnzymology, Vol. 48, pp. 97 191, 1979, ed. by AltonMeister . The only known exception is the glucokinase described in FEBS Letters, Vol. 37, pp. 212 216, 1973 obtained from thermophilic Bacillus stearothermophilus, this enzyme is heat stable and has long storage stability.Pyruvate kinase is found in all living tissues such as animals, plants, yeast and bacteria that metabolize carbohydrates by glycolysis or fermentation. In the living cells, the enzyme catalyzes the reaction of forming adenosine triphosphate and pyruvic acid from phosphoenolpyruvic acid PEP and adenosine diphosphate ADP , so it is used for determination of PEP and ADP.The conventional crystal of pyruvate kinase is available as an isolate from rabbit muscle or swine heart seeMethods in Enzymology, Vol. 1, p. 435, 1955 and Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 234, p. 2428, 1959 , but such pyruvate kinase is so labile that it is not suitable for industrial use. Japanese Patent Application OPI No.9392 78 describes a method of producing a highly heatstable, heat resistant pyruvate kinase from a thermophilic Thermus thermophilus, and Seikagaku Biochemistry ,Vol. 44, p. 649, 1972, describes a method of producing the same enzyme from a thermophilic Bacillus stearothermophilus.To obtain these useful endoenzymes, cultured cells must be first collected by centrifugation or other suitable means before the desired enzyme is extracted from the cells by ultrasonic treatment or physical breaking. The collection of cultured cells is difficult, as was already mentioned, because of the low specific gravity of bacteria. In addition, bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus have a relatively hard membrane which can be broken so slightly that the efficiency in extraction of a desired enzyme is low. For these reasons, it has been difficult to produce these enzymes on an industrial scale.Therefore, one object of the invention is to provide a thermophilic bacterium having an easily settleable cell and an easily breakable cell wall.Another object of the invention is to provide a process for industrial large scale production of a useful enzyme selected from the group consisting of a heat resistant acetate kinase, a heat resistant polynucleotide phosphorylase, heat resistant maleate dehydrogenase, heat resistant glucokinase, heat resistant glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase and heat resistant pyrovate kinase. To achieve these objects, we conducted a screening of naturally occurring microorganisms by Koch s plate culture for example, see William Burrows, Textbook ofMicrobiology, 19th ed, P 21, W.B. Saunders Company, USA in search for a thermophilic bacterium having an easily settleable cell and an easily breakable cell wall. As a result, we found a new strain in manure in Ogura, Uji,Kyoto, Japan. In consideration of its properties, the strain is believed to belong to Bacillus stearothermophilus, but the cell is extremely elongated and is several to several tens of times larger than the cell of known Bacillus stearothermophilus described inBergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology.We have found that the new strain is a thermophilic microorganism that contains various useful enzymes and which has an easily settleable cell and an easily breakable cell wall.Therefore, this invention provides a biologically pure culture of strain UK 788 that belongs to Bacillus stearothermophilus, the cell of which is longer than about 10 microns and which permits easier release of intracellular components than a type culture Bacillus stearothermophilus IAM 11001. The invention also provides a process for producing a useful enzyme by culturing cells of UK 788 and recovering the desired enzyme from the culture.A biologically pure culture of the strain UK 788 of this invention is very advantageous in industrial use because the cultured cells of the strain can easily be collected and are easy to break. According to this invention, a useful enzyme can be obtained efficiently on an industrial scale.Fig. 1 is a micrograph 150 x of the cells of the strain of this invention and a type culture Bacillus stearothermophilus IAM 11001 after culturing on a nutrient agar slant culture at 600C for 24 hours and Fig. 2 is a graph showing the relation between ultrasonic treatment time and protein leak, i.e., a graph showing a degree of a break ing tendency of the bacterial cell.The mycological properties of a biologically pure culture of UK 788 FERM P No. 5141 of Bacillus stearothermophilus are described below. This culture also has been deposited at the IFO Institute on November 10, 1980 and has been assigned the deposition number IFO 14093.For the methods and the compositions of media used in the determination of mycological properties, see theManual of Microbiological Methods, 1957, ed. by Society of American Bacteriologists, McGraw Hill Book Company,Biseibutsu no Bunrui to Dotei Classification andIdentification of Microorganisms , 1975, ed. by TakeharuHasegawa, Tokyo Daigaku Shuppan Kai, and BaichigakuKakuron Study of Culture Media , 1967, by ToshiichiSakazaki, Naya Publishing Company.

We therefore compared the strain of this invention with the following type cultures of Bacillus stearothermophilus, IAM 11001, 11002, 11003, 11004 stored at Institute ofApplied Microbiology, The University of Tokyo and IFO 12550 stored at Institute for Fermentation, Osaka .The new strain UK 788 differed from the type cultures with respect to two or three physiological properties.The biggest difference is in the size of the cell as is clearly seen from Table 1 and Figure 1. Figure 1 is a micrograph 150 x of the cells of new strain UK 788 and type culture IAM 11001 that were subjected to nutrient slant culture at 60 C for 24 hours. In the micrograph, the cell of new strain UK 788 is seen as a much elongated filament, and the cell of the type culture is seen as a dot or short rod. The strain of this invention has a cell much more elongated than the cell of the type culture of Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Bacillus stearothermophilus having a cell comparable to the cell of UK 788 is not described in Bergey s Manual, loc. cit., or any other reports. we therefore concluded that the strain used in this invention is completely new and named it, as indicated above, Bacillus stearothermophilus UK 788 hereinafter, referred to as FERM P No. 5141, IFO 14093 .The strain was a biologically pure culture and was deposited with the Fermentation Research Institute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry at No. 1 3, Higashi 1 Chome, Yatabe Machi, Tsukuba Gun, Ibaragi, Japan onAugust 10, 1979 under a receipt number FERM P No. 5141.The strain has been further deposited at IFO Institute on November 10, 1980 under a receipt No IFO 14093.

The medium can contain a variety of nutrient sources carbon sources include sugars such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, starch hydrolyzate, molasses and sulfite pulp spent liquor, organic acids such as acetic acid and lactic acid, and also alcohols, fats and oils, aliphatic acids, and glycerin that can be assimilated by strain PERMSP No. 5141 nitrogen sources include inorganic or organic materials such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, uric acid, ammonia, nitrate, amino acid, peptone, meat extract and yeast extract inorganic salts such as potassium, sodium, phosphoric acid, zinc, iron, magnesium, manganese, copper, calcium, and cobalt salts.Optionally, traces of metals, corn steep liquor, vitamins, nucleic acid, etc., may also be used. Nutrient sources commonly utilized by bacteria may be used. On a medium containing these nutrient sources, the strain FERM P No. 5141 of this invention is cultured aerobically for from about 2 to 6 hours, generally at from about 20 to 800C, preferably at from 40 to 70 C, and more preferably at from 50 to 636C. Cells containing a heat resistant acetate kinase can be obtained by either batch culture or continuous culture.

An example of such a conventional technique is escribedin Journal ofBiochemistry, Vol. 84, No. 1, pp. 193 203, 1978.

One example of a method of producing a heat resistant pyruvate kinase is described in Seikagaku Biochemistry , Vol. 44 p. 649, 1972. These useful enzyme obtained can be purified by the techniques described above, and the physicochemical properties of the resulting crystals and the mechanism of their actions can be compared with those of the crystals obtained from other strains of Bacillus stearothermophilus the heat resistant acetate kinase obtained according to the present invention has the same properties as the oneS described in Journal of Biochemistry, Vol. 84, No. 1, pp. 193 203, 1978 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 25088 77, the heat resistant polynucleotide phosphrylase obtained according to the present invention has the same properties as the one described in Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 3, p. 219, 1976, the heat resistant maleate dehydrogenase obtained according tp the present invention has the same properties as the one described in Biochemical Journal,Vol. 177, p. 441, 1979 the heat resistant glucokinase obtained according to the present inveniton has the same properties as the one described in HEBE Letters, Vol. 37, p. 212, 1973 and the heat resistant pyruvate kinase obtained according to the present invention has the same properties as the ones described in Seikagaku Biochemistry , Vol. 44, p. 649, 1972 and JapanesePatent Application OPI No. 9392 78. The physicochemical properties of the crystal of the heat resistant glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and the mechanism of its action are specifically described below. The heat resistant glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase according to this invention is a glucose 6 phosphate wherein the maximum residual activity of the enzyme, when treated in a buffer at about 500C for about 15 minutes, can be maintained at about 80 or more, preferably about 90 or more, and more preferably about 100 , based on the original activity. The concentration and pH of the buffer are not limited to particular values, and generally, the concentration is between 5 mM and 500mM, and the H is between 7 and 10.5.For the purposes of this invention, 100 mM tris HCQ buffer pH ca. 9.0 containing 100 mM potassium chloride is preferred.1. Activity The glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes a reaction represented by the following scheme Fexose 6 phosphate coenzyme oxidation type Hexose aldonic acid 6 phosphate coenzyme reduction type In these schemes, the hexose 6 phosphate is a generic term for glucose 6 phosphate, mannose 6 phosphate and galactose6 phosphate, and the hexose.aldonic acid 6 phosphate is a generic term for gluconic acid 6 phosphate, mannoic acid 6 phosphate and galactonic acid 6 phosphate. The coenzyme is either NADP or NAD. 2. Substrate specificity The glucose 6 phosphate has a Nichaelis constant Em value of about 0.16 mM. The reaction rates for a given concentration of substrates mannose 6 phosphate and galactose6 phosphate are about 40 and 20 , respectively, of the rate for glucose 6 phosphate. The Km values for coenzymes NADP and NAD are about 0.016 mM and 1.64 mM, respectively.3. Optimum pH About 9.0 at 3000 4. Stable pH range Little inactivation occurs at a pR of 7.0 to .10.5 even if the enzyme is treated at 400 for 24 hours.5. Temperature range suitable for exhibiting enzyme activity The activity increases with a temperature increase from 25 to 75 C at a pE of 8.9. In most cases, the enzyme is used to catalyze the reaction at 3000. 6. Beat resistance The enzyme is stable against heating at 57 C for 15 minutes.7. Molecular weight Gel chromatography on Sephacryl S 200 showed that the enzyme had a molecular weight of about 230,000. The glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase from yeast or Leuconostoc mesenteroides had a molecular weight of about 100,000 in the same analysis.8. Determination of enzyme activity To a mixture of 2 mM glucose 6 phosphate, 0.5 mM mBD9, and 5 mM magnesium chloride in 50 mM tris HCl buffer pH 8.9 , a suitable amount of glucose 6 pho,sphate dehydrogenase was added1 and the activity of the enzyme was determined on the basis of the increase in the absorbance at 340 nm of RADP reduction type H for a given time. The activity required to increase the absorbance of 1 micromol of RADPH at 340 nm per minute was defined to be one unit.A purified glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase had an activity of about 100 units per mg of purified enzyme at 300cm Since the glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase of this invention is highly heatresistant, it is capable of catalyzing the desired reaction at a temperature between about 5 and 60 C, at which the previously used glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase is inactivated. The activity in that temperature range is even higher. 9. Purity In a disc electrophoresishin .5 a acrylamide at pH 9.4, the purified product of the glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase moved to the positive electrode and gave a single band. In S2S electrophoresis, the enzyme also moved to the positive electrode and gave a single band.10. Compositional analysis The proportions of the amino äcids in the glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase are set forth below Aspartic acid 11.04 , threonine 5.24 ,b, serine 4.56 , glutamic acid 11.86 , proline 3.66 , glycine 6.6 , alanine 7,92 , cystine cysteine 0.62 , valine 6.09 , methionine 1.97 , isoleucine 5.59 , leucine 8.04 , tyrosine 3.72 , phenylalanine 4.8W , lysine 5.28 , histidine 3.40 , arginine 6.56 , tryptophan 2.72 11.Crystalline structure The glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase has yet to be crystallized, so its crystalline structure has not been determined. The cells of FERM P No. 5141 cultured and harvested by the method of this invention are very easy to collect, and the centrifugation time, that was 10 minutes at 8000 G with the known strains of Bacillus stearothermothilus, is reduced to about a fifth thereof. This offers a great merit because it permits so far impractical cell collection by filtration through a filter medium. The cells of the knownBacillus stearothermophilus required 15 minutes of ultrasonic treatment Freozuency 10 KHz, Output 200 W to break, but the collected cells of PERM P No. 5141 can be equaily broken by an ultrasonic treatment that last s for only about 3 minutes under the same conditions.This also presents a significant advantage in the industrialproduction of a useful enzyme. This invention is now described in greater detail by reference to the following examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only and are by no means intended to limit the scope of the invention. Example I and Comparative Example 1 A 500 ml conical flask was charged with 100 ml of a medium prepared by dissolving in one liter of tap water a mixture of 2 g of glucose, 2 g of EE4 2S04, 1 g of yeast extract Difco , 1 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of Na S 4.12E20 and 0.1 g of MgS04 7H20, closed up with a cotton stopper and sterilized with pressurized steam 121 C,latm. for 10 minutes. The medium was cooled to 500C and inoculated with Bacillus stearothermophilus UK 788 FERM P No. 5141 grown on a nutrient agar slant medium of the same formulation as indicated above, and subjected to rotary shake cultivation in a rotary shaker RGR No. 2 type shaker of Takasaki Seisakusho, 180 rpm at 5500. After conducting the rotary shake cultivation for 5 hours, when the growth of cells was observed, the turbidity of the medium was had an absorbance of 1.0 at 660 nm measured by 101 type spectrophotometer produced by Hitachi, Ltd. and the growth of cells entered the last stage of the logarithmic growth phase, the cultivation was stopped and the cells were collected by centrifugation with a centrifuge RS 71 of Tommy Seisakusho for 2 minutes at 8000 G. The yield of cells.collected was determined. One gram of the wet cells was suspended in 20 mZ of 0.1M phosphate buffer pR 7.0 and the protein that leaked from the cells treated with an ultrasonic breaker Model 200 M of Kubota Medical Appliance Supply Corp. was measured. In Comparative Example 1, the procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that Bacillus stearothermorhilus IAM 11001 was used. It was confirmed that the cells of ZE MSP No. 5141 could be recovered from the culture medium by centrifugation more easily than the cells of IAM 11001 the percent recovery of FERM P No. 5141 was 98 and that of IAN 11001 was 426 0, Figure 2 represents the relation between ultrasonic treatment time and protein leak. In the figures, curve A represents Example 1 and curve B represents Comparative Example 1. As is clear from Figure 2,the cells used inExample 1 could be broken and intracellular protein leaked by an ultrasonic treatment required only about a fifth of the period required to break the cells used in Comparative Example 1.The protein leak was determined by the biuret method see Gornall A.G., Journal of Biological Chemistry,Vol. 177, p. 751, 1949 . ExamPle 2 Culture was performed in ten 500 mQ conical flasks using a medium of the same composition as used in Example 1.The liquid cultures were combined, transferred to a 30 liter jar fermentor MSJ U Model of Marubishi Rika Sochi, using a straight impeller turbine that contained 20 liters of a medium of the same composition and which had been sterilized with pressurized steam 1210C l atm., 15 minutes , and subjected to fermentation at 600C and 400 rpm with air supplied at a rate of 20 liters min. Cell growth was soon observed and a drop in pH occurred. The fermentation was continued for another 3 hours while 4N NaOH was used to maintain the pR at 6.5.When the cell growth entered the last stage of the logarithmic growth phase, the culture was stopped and the medium was continuously centrifuged with a centrifuge LAPS 202 of AlphaLaval at 8000 G for 2 minutes, to provide 120 g of wet cells in a yield of 97 o. In the same manner as in Example 1, the relation between the ultrasonic treatment time and intracellular protein leak was examined, anN the relative ratio of protein leaked upon a 3 minute treatment was 904 0, indicating that the strain FERM P No. 5141 had easily settleable cells and an easily breakable cell wall even after bench scale fermentation. ExamPle 3 Twenty grams of the wet cells produced in Example 2 were suspended in 200 m of 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and treated with an ultrasonic breaker for 3.minutes. The.resulting solution containing broken cells were centrifuged at 8000 G for 2 minutes to obtain 202.me of a supernatant free from residual cells. Under cooling at 40C, 1.2 g of protamine sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the nucleic acid precipitate was removed by centrifugation.When ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant until it was 75 saturated, protein was stilted out and recovered by centrifugation. The protein precip,itate was dissolved in 20 m of 0.1M phosphate buffer pR 7.5 , and the solution was desalted by dialysis through a Cellophane membrane against 2 liters of 0.1M phosphate buffer pE 7.5 for 4 hours.The desalted solution was fractionally purified to obtain acetylkinase and ATPase by chromatography on a 1 EAE Cellulose column, chromatography on a kydroxyapatite column, and chromatography on an ultrogel column see Journal of Biochemistry, Vol. 84, No. 1, pp. 193 203, 1978 . As a result, electrophoretically pure acetylkinase 0.82 mg and AEPase 0.32 mg were obtained, confirming that the cells of FERM PNo. 5141 were a good source for the supply of useful endoenzymes.
