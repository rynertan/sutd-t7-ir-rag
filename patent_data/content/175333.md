# ELECTRIC LAMP INCLUDING A CONTAINMENT COATING AS PART THELECTRIC LAMP INCLUDING A CONTAINMENT COATING AS PART THEREOF EREOF

## Abstract
An electric lamp having an envelope, a light source capsule mounted within the envelope and a containment coating. The containment coating, which is disposed sub stantially over the outer envelope, has the capability of pre serving the integrity of the envelope from piercing, due to shard dispersion from the light source capsule, in the un likely event that the capsule should fracture. One example of the coating consists of a fluoropolymer material such as a perfluoroalkoxy resin P.F.A. Teflon . The containment coat ing is resistant to, and exhibits a high degree of tensile strength at, high temperatures and is substantially unaffect ed by ultraviolet radiation.
