# Standard cell LSIs.

## Abstract
The packing density of an logic LSI based on standard cell methodology is increased by partially overlapping two adjoining cells Cell 1, Cell 2 so as to provide them with common terminal regions 21, 22 to be connected to the wirings for supplying power B Pattern information of the cells, including information concerning the standardised terminal region pattern, is registered in the cell library of a CAD system, together with a additional sign which can be displayed by the system to indicate to an operator the region of a cell available for overlap with an adjoining cell during chip design operation using a display.
