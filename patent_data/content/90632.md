# Static type random access memory device.

## Abstract
A static type RAM device in which the amplitude of the data signal stored in a memory cell just after the writing in of data is completed is increased and the stability of the data stored in each memory cell is increased. The RAM device comprises a bit line pulling up means for pulling up the poten tial of a bit line to a voltage which is approximately equal to or larger than the power supply voltage and a word line pulling up means for pulling up the potential of a selected word line to a voltage which is larger than the power supply voltage after the writing in of data is completed.
