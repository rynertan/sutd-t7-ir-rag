# Catalyst and process for polymerising olefins.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for preparing sup ported catalysts for the copolymerisation of ethylene with higher alphaolefins, characterised in that a compound of a transition metal of Groups IV, V and VI of the Periodic Table of Elements, used at its maximum valency, is precipitated on to a support of magnesium chloride and possibly aluminium chloride by a reduction reaction in two stages, employing reducing agents selected for the first stage from among alkylaluminium dihalides, and for the second stage from among organometallic compounds with a higher reducing power than that of the alkylaluminium dihalides. These catalysts are particularly well suited to the copolymerisation in the gas phase of ethylene and higher alpha olefins.
