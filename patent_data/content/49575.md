# Process for the production of vinyl halide polymers.

## Abstract
The polymerization of a monomer component compris ing a vinyl halide, e.g. vinyl chloride, in an aqueous medium in the presence of a free radical generating polymerization initiator is terminated by introducing into the polymerization reaction mixture, when from 70 to 95 of the monomer component has been polymerized, from 0.01 to 0.10 by weight, based on the weight of the monomer component, of a chain terminating agent comprising a dialkylhydroxy phenylalkanoic acid ester of a neopentyl polyhydric alcohol, such as pentaerythritol tetrakis 3 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate .
