## Description
DETERGENT ADDITIVES AND DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to additives for detergent compositions, and to detergent compositions containing them. These compositions are particularly, but not essentially, adapted for fabric washing. The invention relates more particularly to substantially phosphate free detergent compositions. Fabric washing compositions conventionally contain phosphate detergency builders such as sodium tripolyphosphate. In some circumstances it is thought that the use of phosphates in detergent compositions can lead to environmental problems in waste waters. There is therefore a desire to reduce the level of phosphorus, or to eliminate it altogether, in detergent compositions. Water insoluble aluminosilicate ion exchange materials have been suggested as alternative builders to phosphates see, for example, GB 1,473,201 and GB 1,473,202 Henkel .It has been found in practice, however, that these aluminosilicate materials, even in large amounts, tend to be undesirably slow in their exchange of cations, especially at low temperatures, resulting in inferior detergency. It has accordingly been suggested that supplementary water soluble builders should be used in combination with these aluminosilicates to raise the detergency to an acceptable level. These supplementary builders are generally materials that are efficient sequestrant builders in their own right, for example, alkali metal tripolyphosphates, nitrilotriacetates and poly 0 hydroxyacrylates. High levels of these materials are, however, not generally desirable in detergent compositions for cost or environmental reasons. We have now discovered that, surprisingly, the detergency of aluminosilicate built detergent products can be substantially boosted by partially replacing the aluminosilicate by an organic precipitant builder having a divalent anion. Replacement of 15 to 30 of the aluminosilicate by such an organic precipitant builder has been found to give detergency results comparable to those obtainable using combinations of zeolite and sodium tripolyphosphate as builders. It is known that the detergency builder properties of aluminosilicates are enhanced by the addition of watersoluble complexing agents such as sodium tripolyphosphate.This effect has been explained in terms of the so called carrier molecule model see, for example, P Berth,J. Am. Oil Chemists Soc., 55 , 52 53 1978 . The complexing agent is able to take up polvalent water hardness ions notably Ca2 , but also Mg2 from solid surfaces such as the surface of a textile fibre and pass them on to the aluminosilicate ion exchanger after transport through the aqueous medium. The complexing agent forms a chelate complex with the hardness ion which on arrival at the surface of the aluminosilicate dissociates. It is not easy to envisage a similar mechanism with precipitant builders, since these remove hardness ions from the wash liquor by the virtually irreversible formation of a precipitate insoluble calcium or magnesium salt . It is thus surprising that aluminosilicate precipitant combinations can give building properties comparable to those of aluminosilicate complexing agent combinations. Attempts have been made to use the commonest organic precipitant builder, soap, as a supplementary builder for zeolites, but detergency benefits have been obtained only at impractically high builder concentrations 8 g l and above . This is a consequence of the low weight effectiveness of soaps when used as builders since the soap anion is monovalent two moles of soap are consumed by 2 2 each gram ion of Ca or Mg GB 1,545,801 Procter Gamble discloses a spray dried granular detergent composition comprising from 1 to 40 by weight of an organic detergent component from 3 to 25 by weight of a water insoluble crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material of the formula Na12 Al02.SiO2312. x 2 wherein x is an integer of from 20 to 30 from 5 to 35 by weight of a phosphate builder and from 5 to 25 of an alkali metal silicate. The organic detergent component may be inter alia a water soluble salt of a C6 to C20 alpha sulphocarboxylic acid. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a detergent composition comprising a from about 3 to about 90 by weight of one or more detergent active agents, and b from about 10 to about 97 by weight of a detergent additive consisting essentially of i from about 25 to about 97 by weight, based on the detergent additive, of a crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicate cation exchange material, and ii from about 3 to about 75 by weight of an organic precipitant builder having the formula I EMI4.1 wherein R1 is Clo C24 alkyl or alkenyl, or an arylalkyl or alkylaryl group of equivalent chain length X is C, CR2, N or CON R2 is C1 C3 alkylY is hydrogen or a solubilising cation, preferably alkali metal and especially sodium n and m, which may be the same or different, are 0 or integers from 1 to 4 andZ is COOY or S03Y, with the proviso that if the organic precipitant builder is a C6 to C20C sulphocarboxylic acid and the aluminosilicate material is crystalline, the composition contains less than 5 , preferably 3 or less, of inorganic phosphate. The organic precipitant builder is a water soluble material that reacts with Ca2 ions, and preferably also with Mg2 ions, in a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio, to form an insoluble salt. The solubility product of the calcium salt of the organic precipitant builder is preferably less than 10 8. One preferred group of compounds within the general formula I consists of those in which X is CH, n is zero, and m is 0 or 1. Thus, according to a first preferred embodiment of the invention, the organic precipitant builder is a compound of the formula II EMI5.1 wherein R1, Y and Z have the meanings given above, and p is 0 or 1. Especially preferred classes of compounds within the general formula II are the following i substituted malonates of the formula III EMI5.2 and ii substituted succinates of the formula IV EMI5.3 Compounds of the formulae III and IV are described, for example, in GB 1,293,753, GB 1,342,247 and GB 1,342,340 Unilever . Examples of such compounds include disodium dodecyl malonate C12 AKM , disodium hexadecenyl succinate C16 l AKS , and disodium mixed C15 C18 succinate C15 18 AKS . According to a second preferred embodiment of the invention, the organic precipitant builder is a compound of the formula V EMI5.4 or of the formula VI EMI6.1 wherein R1 and Y have the meanings given above and v and w are each 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2. Compounds of the formula V in which v and w are both 1, the N alkyl iminodiacetates, are of especial interest. Compounds of the formula V in which v and w are both 2, the p iminodipropionates, are known amphoteric surfactants, disclosed, for example, in GB 1,296,793 General Mills . These materials are also known as lather promoters in soap bars, a for example, inEP 0 025 242 Procter Gamble , and as anti corrosive agents, for example, in US 2,926,108 General Mills .Compounds of the formula V in which v and w are both 1, the iminodiacetates, have also been disclosed, for example, as scum dispersants in soap products, in US 3,630,927 Monsanto , and as anti corrosive agents, in US 2,368,604 Shell . US 3,981,779 Grace discloses compounds of both formulae V and VI for use as chelant surfactants for decreasing the fouling of metals by aqueous systems. GB 761,384 California Research Corporation discloses detergent compositions containing 10 to 50 by weight of alkylbenzene sulphonate and 5 to 208 by weight of a watersoluble salt of an N C8 C18 alkyl iminodiacetic acid, the latter component acting as a foam promoter. Similarly,GB 761,383 California Research Corporation discloses combinations of alkyl sulphates and N C8 C18 alkyl iminodicarboxylic acids. Other specifications relating to the use of compounds of the formula V in detergent compositions are GB 446,737 and GB 446,813 I G Farben . Compounds analogous to those of formula V but having a shorter alkyl chain C8 or less are known as sequestrant builders, as in GB 1,383,025 Chemische Werke Hills , and as rancidity preventers in soaps and non soap detergents, as in GB 574,504 Unilever . The aluminosilicate cation exchange material is a crystalline or amorphous material having the general formula Cat2 n 0 x Al2O3 SO2 yZH2O wherein Cat is a cation having valency n that is exchangeable with calcium e.g. Na or K x is a number from 0.7 1.5 y is a number from 1.3 4 and z is such that the bound water content is from 10 to 28 by weight. Preferably a crystalline material is used which can be described by the unit cell content Nax AlO2 x SiO2 y zH2O wherein x and y are integers of at least 6, the ratio of x to y being in the range of 1 1 to 1 2 and z is such that the bound water content is from 10 to 28 by weight. The aluminosilicate preferably has a particle size of from 0.1 to 100 micrometres, ideally between 0.1 and 10 micrometres, and an ion exchange capacity of at least 200 mg CaCO3 per gram of aluminosilicate anhydrous basis . In a preferred embodiment the water insoluble aluminosilicate is a crystalline material having the formula described by the unit cell content Na12 A102 12. SiO2 12. 2 wherein z is from 20 to 30, preferably about 27. An example of this material is the commercially available product known as Zeolite type A, which is typically Na2O.A1203.2SiO2. 4.5H2O and is also described by the unit cell content Na12 AlO2 12 SiO2 12 27H2O. The detergent composition of the invention contains from about 10 to about 97 by weight of the specified detergent additive, preferably from about 12 to about 80 , more preferably from about 15 to about 70 , and especially from about 16 to about 67 . Since the detergent additive contains from about 25 to about 97 by weight of aluminosilicate, the aluminosilicate content of the detergent composition can range from about 2.5 to about 94 . An aluminosilicate content of from about 10 to about 60 , especially from about 12 to about 55 , is especially preferred. Similarly, the content of organic precipitant builder can range from about 0.3 to about 73 , a range of from about 1 to about 30 , especially from about 3 to about 17 , being especially preferred. The detergent compositions of the present invention are preferably substantially free of inorganic phosphate.This is highly desirable for the environmental reasons mentioned earlier. Compositions according to the invention containing no inorganic phosphate have been found to exhibit detergency properties comparable to those of sodium tripolyphosphate built products. If desired, however, the compositions may contain inorganic phosphate, but preferably at a level not exceeding 10 based on the whole product. Any phosphate present may, for example, be in the form of alkali metal preferably sodium tripolyphosphate, orthophosphate, pyrophosphate or polymeric phosphate. As previously mentioned, however, the phosphate content must be less than 5 , preferably 3 or less, if the organic precipitant builder is a particularO sulphocarboxylic acid salt. O sulphocarboxylic acid salts of the formula VII EMI9.1 wherein R1 and Y have the meanings given previously, are of interest as organic precipitant builders for use in the present invention, although the previously mentioned malonates and succinates of the formulae III and IV are preferred. Compounds of the formula VII are described, for example, in GB 1,368,736 and GB 1,380,390 Unilever .A typical example is disodium O sulphostearate C18 SFAS . Blends of compounds of different chain lengths, for example, the t sulpho salt of coconut fatty acids coco SFAS , or of tallow fatty acids tallow SFAS , or of blended coconut and tallow fatty acids, may also advantageously be used. In a second aspect, the present invention provides a detergent additive consisting essentially of i from about 25 to about 97 by weight of a crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicate cation exchange material, and ii from about 3 to about 75 by weight of an organic precipitant builder having a polyvalent, preferably divalent, anion, with the proviso that when the aluminosilicate material i is crystalline, the organic precipitant builder is not a water soluble salt of a C6 to C20C sulphocarboxylic acid. The organic precipitant builder constitutes from about 38 to about 75 by weight of the builder mix detergent additive of the invention, preferably from about 10 to about 60 and especially from about 15 to about 30 . The detergent additive of the present invention is an efficient builder system yielding good detergency results when incorporated, with detergent active materials, in a detergent composition. Returning now to the first aspect of the invention, the detergent compositions of the invention may if desired contain further non phosphate builders. The compositions may for example contain organic sequestrant builders in addition to the organic precipitants, for example, as disclosed in our co pending Application of even date CaseC.1303 entitled Detergent additives and detergent compositions containing them . Organic sequestrant builders are water soluble materials which form soluble complexes with calcium, preferably with pKCa greater than 3.0, preferably greater than 4.0 and more preferably greater than 4.5. Some sequestrant builders also form complexes with magnesium, preferably with p g g greater than 4.0. Examples of such materials include alkali metal especially sodium salts of the following acids nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid, polyacrylic acid, poly C hydroxyacrylic acid, carboxymethyloxymalonic acid, carboxmethyloxysuccinic acid, oxydiacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, citric acid, dipicolinic acid and many more. The polyacetal carboxylates disclosed in US 4,144,126 and US 4,146,495 Monsanto and the oxidised polysaccharides disclosed in GB 1,330,121, GB 1,330,122 and GB 1,330, 123 Unilever may also advantageously be used. The detergent composition of the invention necessarily includes from about 3 to about 90 by weight, preferably from about 5 to about 40 by weight, more preferably from about 10 to about 25 by weight, of a synthetic anionic, nonionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compound or mixture thereof. Many suitable detergent active compounds are commercially available and are fully described in the literature, for example in Surface Active Agents andDetergents , Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry andBerch. The preferred detergent compounds which can be used are synthetic anionic and nonionic compounds. The former are usually water soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher aryl radicals.Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher C8 C18 alcohols produced for example from tallow or coconut oil sodium and potassium alkyl Cg C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10 C15 benzene sulphonates sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum sodium coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates and sulphonates sodium and potassium salts of sulphuric acid esters of higher C9 C18 fatty alcohol alkylene oxide, particularly ethylene oxide, reaction products the reaction products of fatty acids such as coconut fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralised with sodium hydroxide sodium and potassium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl taurine alkane monosulphonates such as those derived by reacting alpha olefins C8 C20 with sodium bisulphate and those derived by reacting paraffins with S02 and C12 and then hydrolysing with a base to produce a random sulphonate and olefin sulphonates, which term is used to describe the material made by reacting olefins, particularly C10 C20 alpha olefins, with SO3 and then neutralising and hydrolysing the reaction product. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium Cll Cl5 alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C16 Cl8 alkyl sulphates. Examples of suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used include in particular the reaction products of alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide, with alkyl C6 C22 phenols, generally 5 to 25 EO, ie 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule the condensation products of aliphatic C8 C18 primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 6 to 30 EO, and products made by condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction products of propylene oxide and ethylenediamine. Other so called nonionic detergent compounds include long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides. Mixtures of detergent compounds, for example mixed anionic or mixed anionic and nonionic compounds may be used in the detergent compositions, particularly in the latter case to provide controlled low sudsing properties. This is beneficial for compositions intended for use in suds intolerant automatic washing machines. Anionic and nonionic detergent compounds are advantageously used together in ratios of from 3 1 to 1.5 1. Amounts of amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds can also be used in the compositions of the invention but this is not normally desired due to their relatively high cost. If any amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds are used it is generally in small amounts in compositions based on the much more commonly used synthetic anionic and or nonionic detergent compounds. If desired, the composition of the invention may also include soap. The presence of small amounts of soap is beneficial with respect to lather control and detergency.Soaps which may be used are especially the sodium or less desirably the potassium, salts of C10 C24 fatty acids.Soaps based mainly on the longer chain fatty acids within this range, that is to say, with at least half of the soap having a chain length of C16 or more, are especially preferred. This preferred chain length distribution may be conveniently obtained by using soaps from natural sources such as tallow, palm oil or rapeseed oil, which may be hardened if desired, with lesser amounts of other, shorter chain soaps prepared from nut oils such as coconut oil or palm kernel oil. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the detergent composition also contains a bleach system. The bleach system preferably comprises a peroxy bleach compound which is an inorganic persalt, which is preferably used in conjunction with an activator therefor. The persalt may be, for example, sodium perborate either the monohydrate or the tetrahydrate or sodium percarbonate.The activator makes the bleaching more effective at lower temperatures, ie in the range from ambient temperature to about 60 C, so that such bleach systems are commonly known as low temperature bleach systems and are well known in the art. The inorganic persalt acts to release active oxygen in solution, and the activator is usually an organic compound having one or more reactive acyl residues, which cause the formation of peracids, the latter providing for a more effective bleaching action at lower temperatures than can be obtained by use of the peroxy bleach compound alone. The ratio by weight of the peroxy bleach compound to the activator is generally from about 20 1 to about 1 1, preferably about 15 1 to about 2 1. The detergent composition of the invention preferably contains from about 5 to about 308 by weight of the peroxy bleach compound, and about 0.1 to about 15 by weight of the activator. The total amount of the bleach system ingredients preferably lies within the range of from 5 to 35 by weight, especially from about 6 to about 30 by weight. Typical examples of suitable peroxy bleach compounds are alkali metal perborates, both tetrahydrates and monohydrates, alkali metal percarbonates, persilicates and perphosphates, of which sodium perborate is preferred. Activators for peroxy bleach compounds have been amply described in the literature, including British patents 836,988, 855,735, 907,356, 907,358, 970,950, 1,003,310 and 1,246,339, US patents 3,332,882 and 4,128,494, Canadian patent 844,481 and South African patent 68 6,344. Specific suitable activators include a N diacylated and N,N polyacylated amines, such as N,N,N ,N tetraacetyl methylene diamine and N,N,N ,N tetraacetyl ethylene diamine, N,N diacetylaniline, N,N diacetyl p toluidine 1,3 diacylated hydantoins such as, for example, 1,3 diacetyl 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin and 1,3 dipropionyl hydantoin OC acetoxy N,N1 polyacylmalonamide, for example Q acetoxy N,N diacetylmalonamide b N alkyl N sulphonyl carbonamides, for example the compounds N methyl N mesyl acetamide, N methyl N mesyl benzamide, N methyl N mesyl p nitrobenzamide, and N methyl N mesyl p methoxybenzamide c N acylated cyclic hydrazides, acylated triazones or urazoles, for example monoacetylmaleic acid hydrazide d O,N,N trisubstituted hydroxylamines, such as O benzoyl N,N succinyl hydroxylamine, O acetyl N,N succinyl hydroxylamine, O p methoxybenzoyl N, N succinyl hydroxylamine, O p nitrobenzoyl N, N succinyl hydroxylamine and O,N,N triacetyl hydroxylamine e N,N diacyl sulphurylamides, for example N,N dimethyl N,N diacetyl sulphurylamide and N,N diethyl N,N dipropionyl sulphurylamide f Triacylcyanurates, for example triacetyl cyanurate and tribenzoyl cyanuratet g Carboxylic acid anhydrides, such as benzoic anhydride, m chloro benzoic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, 4 chloro phthalic anhydride h Sugar esters, for example glucose pentaacetate i 1,3 diacyl 4,5 diacyloxy imidazolidine, for example 1, 3 diformyl 4, 5 diacetoxy imidazolidine, 1, 3 diacetyl 4, 5 diacetoxy imidazolidine, 1, 3 diacetyl 4, 5 dipropionyloxy imidazoline j Tetraacetylglycoluril and tetrapropionylglycoluril k Diacylated 2,5 diketopiperazine, such as 1,4 diacetyl 2,5 diketopiperazine, 1,4 dipropionyl 2,5 diketopiperazine and 1,4 dipropionyl 3,6 dimetyl 2,5 diketopiperazine 1 Acylation products of propylenediurea or 2,2 dimethyl propylenediurea 2,4,6,8 tetraaza bicyclo 3,3,1 nonane 3,7 dione or its 9,9 dimethyl derivative , especially the tetraacetyl or the tetrapropionyl propylenediurea or their dimethyl derivatives m Carbonic acid esters, for example the sodium salts of p ethoxycarbonyloxy benzoic acid and p propoxy carbonyloxy benzenesulphonic acid. n t acyloxy N,N polyacyl malonamides, such as SSacetoxy N,N diacetyl malonamide. The N diacylated and N,N polyacylatedamines mentioned under a are of special interest, particularly ,N,N ,N tetra acetyl ethylenediamine TAED . It is preferred to use the activator in granular form, preferably wherein the activator is finely divided as described in our UK Patent Application No. 80 21979.Specifically, it is preferred to have an activator of an average particle size of less than 150 micrometres, which gives significant improvement in bleach efficiency. The sedimentation losses, when using an activator with an average particle size of less than 150 lum, are substantially decreased. Even better bleach performance is obtained if the average particle size of the activator is less than 100 um.However, too small a particle size gives increased decomposition, dust formation and handling problems, and although particle sizes below 100 um can provide for an improved bleaching efficiency, it is desirable that the activator should not have more than 20 by weight of particles with a size of less than 50On the other hand, the activator may have a certain amount of particles of a size greater than 150 um, but it should not contain more than 5 by weight of particles 300 um, and not more than 20 by weight of particles 200 um, preferably l50 um. It is to be understood that these particle sizes refer to the activator present in the granules, and not to the granules themselves.The latter have a particle size, the major part of it ranging from 100 to 2000 um, preferably 250 to 1000 um. Up to 5 by weight of granules with a particle size of1700 um and up to 10 by weight of granules z 250 1um is tolerable. The granules incorporating the activator, preferably in this finely divided form, may be obtained by granulating a suitable carrier material, such as sodium tripolyphosphate and or potassium tripolyphosphate with activator particles of the required size. Other granulation methods, e.g. using organic and or inorganic granulation aids, can also be usefully applied. The granules can be subsequently dried, if required.Basically, any granulation process is applicable, as long as the granule contains the activator, and as long as the other materials present in the granule do not negatively affect the activator. It is particularly preferred to include in the detergent compositions a stabiliser for the bleach system, for example ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate and diethylene triamine pentamethylene phosphonate. These stabilisers can be used in acid or salts form, especially in calcium, magnesium, zinc or aluminium salt form, as described in our UK PatentApplication No 2 048 930. Apart from the components already mentioned, the detergent compositions of the invention can contain any of the conventional additives in the amounts in which such materials are normally employed in fabric washing detergent compositions. Examples of these additives include lather boosters such as alkanolamides, particularly the monoethanolamides derived from palm kernel fatty acids and coconut fatty acids lather depressants such as alkyl phosphates, silicones, or alkyl phosphonic acids incorporated in petroleum jelly, wax or mineral oil anti redeposition agents such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose and cellulose ethers fabric softening agents inorganic salts such as sodium sulphate and sodium carbonate and, usually present in very minor amounts, fluorescent agents, perfumes, enzymes such as proteases and amylases. It may be desirable to include in the composition an amount of an alkali metal silicate, particularly sodium ortho , meta or preferably neutral or alkaline silicate.The presence of such alkali metal silicates at levels of at least about 1 , and preferably from about 5 to about 15 by weight of the composition, is advantageous in decreasing the corrosion of metal parts in washing machines, besides giving processing benefits and generally improved powder properties. The more highly alkaline ortho and meta silicates would normally only be used at lower amounts within this range, in admixture with the neutral or alkaline silicates. The composition of the invention is preferably alkaline, but not too strongly alkaline as this could result in fabric damage and also be hazardous for domestic usage. In practice the composition should desirably give a pH of from about 8.5 to about 11 in use in aqueous wash solution. It is preferred in particular for domestic products to have a pH of from about 9.0 to about 10.5 as lower pH s tend to be less effective for optimum detergency building, and more highly alkaline products can be hazardous if misused. The pH is measured at the lowest normal usage concentration of 0.1 w v of the product in water of 12 H Ca , French permanent hardness, calcium only at 500C so that a satisfactory degree of alkalinity can be assured in use at all normal product concentrations.If necessary, up to 10 by weight of alkali metal carbonate, preferably sodium carbonate, may be included in order to raise the pH and to maintain adequate buffer capacity in the presence of acidic soils. If carbonate or phosphates are present it may be desirable to include in the composition of the invention one or more antideposition agents, to decrease any tendency to form inorganic deposits on washed fabrics. The amount of any such antideposition agent is normally from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight, preferably from about 0.2 to about 1.5 by weight of the composition. The preferred antideposition agents are anionic polyelectrolytes, especially polymeric aliphatic carboxylates, or organic phosphonates. The detergent compositions of the invention should desirably be in free flowing particulate, for example, powdered or granular form, and can be produced by any of the techniques commonly employed in the manufacture of such washing compositions, for example, by slurry making and spray drying processes. It is preferred that the process used to form the compositions should result in a product having a moisture content of not more than about 12 , more preferably from about 4 to about 10 by weight. The detergent compositions of the invention may also be in the form of bars or tablets, or in liquid form. The invention will now be illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. EXAMPLES In the Examples that follow, the detergencies of wash liquors incorporating various builder systems were compared by measuring the reflectance of a clay soiled polyester cotton test cloth before and after washing in theTergotometer. The reflectances were measured using a CarlZeiss Elrepho Reflectrometer and the reflectance increase on washing AR was taken as a measure of detergency. EXAMPLES 1 to 3 In each case a wash liquor was prepared using the ingredients stated below in the concentrations stated below, in 40 FH Ca or 20 FH Ca water. The wash liquor was allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes. Test cloth pieces four pieces per litre, each measuring 76.2 mm x 76.2 mm were then added and a 20 minute wash at 800C, pH 10.0 and 55 r.p.m. agitation was carried out, followed by a rinse in water of the same hardness as that of the water used to prepare the wash liquor.
