# Apparatus for generating constant envelope, angle modulated signals.

## Abstract
First and second bi phase amplitude modulators 20, 22 each modulate a carrier with supplied pulse signals. The pulse signals are representative of information and are interleaved with each other. The pulse duration is selected to cause a suitable amount of pulse overlap. When the modulated car riers are combined 26b in phase quadrature and passed through a surface acoustic wave filter 28 , they form a con stant envelope signal. Appropriate selection of parameters can yield a sinusoidal frequency shift keyed SFSK signal.
