# Improvement in fasteners for diapers.

## Abstract
A diaper fastener strip has a first zone coated with a release material 35 and a coat of adhesive 38 over the release material and a second zone 36 coated only with adhesive 38 . The part of the strip having the second solely adhesive coated zone 36 is adhered tenaciously to the margin of the fluid impermeable outer backing sheet 25 of a diaper. The part of the strip having the first release material plus adhesive coated zone 35 is folded over the diaper margin to contact the adhesive with the margin of the inner fluid permeable sheet 26 of the diaper. When the strip is unfolded the adhesive transfers from the release material in the first zone to said inner sheet margin and becomes exposed for securing the diaper on a body. An alternative strip has said adhesive coated second zone 53 adhered to the backing sheet and two consecutive zones 51, 54 next to it. The first zone 51 most remote from the second zone may have adhesive coated over a release coating so when the first zone 51 is folded over a third zone 54 between the first and second zones and the strip is later peeled back, there will be adhesive transfer to an exposed in said third zone 54 for securing the diaper on a body.
