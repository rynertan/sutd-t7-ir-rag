# Apparatus for bending and tempering glass sheets, especially thin sheets.

## Abstract
Process for bending and tempering glass sheets V , especially thin sheets, characterized in that the glass sheet is submitted to the tempering phase while still being placed, as in the forming phase, on the forming ring 3 integral with a frame 2 which holds the latter, in order to main tain the previously assumed shape unaltered. Apparatus for carrying out said process, which also comprises means provided with vertical rise and fall move ment, both in the forming zone and in the glass sheet dis charge zone, preferably including a coupling device 8 rotating screw with moving screw nut which can sup port the frame 2 with forming ring 3 and the glass sheeet V placed thereupon. The rolls 5, 5a for the horizontal conveying of the glass sheet V provided in the forming and discharge zones, include a central section of constant length B , and two side sections B whose length can be modified according to production requirements. Means 9, 10, 11 are also provided for conveying the frame 2 with integral forming ring 3 in the horizontal direction from the forming zones to the subsequent temper ing and discharge zones, plus other overlying similar means 9 , 10 , 11 designed to return said frame 2 and form ing ring 3 from the discharge zone to the forming zone, and lastly a passageway or chamber 14 suitably formed in the upper nozzle section of the tempering zone, through which may pass the frame 2 and forming ring 3 , as well as their horizontal driving members 9 , 10 , 11 during the return traverse.
