# Waterproof cable and method of production thereof.

## Abstract
In a waterproof optical fiber cable for use in a communica tion system, one or more optical fibers are loosely put in grooves 4 formed along a spacer 2 and a plurality of filled portions 6 are formed in each of said grooves 4 by being filled with dampproof material at predetermined intervals so as to provide a plurality of filled portions 6 and unfilled portions 8 alternately, whereby undesired local bending of the optical fibers can be prevented. Also a method of making the water proof optical fiber cable having such filled portions and unfilled portions is disclosed.
