## Description
Theracutic Compositions and their use in enhancing brain function This invention relates to brain function enhancing compositions. Various drugs are known for the treatment of medical disorders affecting acetylcholine containing neurons in the brain. One such drug, piracetam, has been administered alone and, as is.aescribed in Growdon et al. U.S. Patent No. 9,355,927, in combination with choline, choline salts, or a compound that dissociates to choline, such as an acylglycerophosphocholine, e.g., lecithin, lysolecithin, jor glycerophosphatidyl choline. Piracetam has the following structure EMI1.1 A number of analogs of piracetam are known which, like piracetarn, are capable of enhancing the firing of acetylcholine containing brain neurons in a human, while depleting brain acetylcholine level. One such analog is oxiracetam, having the structure EMI1.2 Oxiracetam is described in itil et al. 1982 Drug Development Research 2, 447. Another piracetam analog is etiracetam, having the structure EMI2.1 Etiracetam is described in British Pat. No. 1,309,692. Another piracetam analog is pramiracetam usually provided in the form of the hydrochloride , having the structure EMI2.2 Pramiracetam is aescribed in British Pat. No. 1,588,082. Another piracetam analog, aniracetam, is described in Foltyn et al. 1983 Drug Res. 33 1 , 865. General formulae including additional effective piracetam analogs are disclosed, e.g., in British Pat.No. 1,588,082. Another drug which has been described in the literature is deanol, described in Harbrich et al 1981 J. Neurochem. 37 2 , 476 T he central cholinergic actions of deanol could result from an increase in the concentration of free choline in blood, which in turn stimulates cholinoceptive neurons in the brain.The relatively long duration of action of deanol several hours in producing an increase in peripheral concentration of choline, as compared with the increase caused by parenteral administration of choline approximately 20 minutes , suggests that treatment of patients with deanol or a combination of choline plus deanol may be preferable to high doses of choline as a means of raising the levels of choline in the body. TAe usefulness of choline as a therapeutic agent is limited by its relatively rapid removal from the body and by its metabolism in the gut to trimethylamine, which leads to an undesirable odor in treated patients. The present results suggest that an inhibitor of choline metabolism in the periphery may be useful when given alone, or in combination with choline, to elicit a central cholinergic effect. In general, the invention features enhancing brain function in a human by administering to the human an effective amount of a piracetam analog capable of enhancing firing of acetylcholine containing brain neurons in a human while depleting the brain acetylcholine level in the human, and an effective amount of a second compound capable of slowing the rate of choline depletion in the human. Preferably the second compound is present in an amount effective to slow choline depletion to a degree sufficient to counteract the acetylcholine depletion caused by the piracetam analog i.e., to prevent the piracetam analog from bringing about a net decrease in brain acetylcholine, In preferred embodiments the piracetam analog is piracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam, etiracetam, or oxiracetam and the second compound is deanol or a compound which dissociates to form deanol, e.g., a salt or ester of deanol, e.g., meclofenoxate or pyrisuccideanol. In other preferred embodiments, the second compound is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, e.g.physostigmine. Two such second compounds can be used together, e.g., deanol and physostigmine can be used together.The advantage of such use is that, for example, when deanol and physostigmine are both used, lower amounts of each can be used, this is particularly advantageous in the case of physostigmine, which is toxic in large doses. The invention provides the brain function enhancement of piracetam analogs without the disadvantages associated with these. Piracetam analogs work by enhancing firing of brain neurons. This firing enhancement can dep lete brain acetylcholine levels, thereby producing, in one re pect, an effect deleterious to brain function. According to the invention, this deleterious effect is counteracted by a compound capable of slowing the rate of choline depletion, e.g., deanol, which inhibits choline metabolism. Other features and avantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description. Description of Preferred EmbodimentsComposition The preferred therapeutic composition contains piracetam and deanol or a compound which dissociates to form deanol. Both piracetam and.deanol are commercially available, as are deanol esters and salts such as meclofenoxate Fr. Pat. M398 and pyrisuccideanol German Pat. No. 2,102,831 . Use The piracetam analog and the second compound can each be administered alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or the active agents and carrier can be combined. For oral administration the phermaceutical compositions can be provided in the form of capsules or tablets, either ordinary or time release. The compositions can also take the form of ingestible liquid, e.g., syrup, or an injectible liquid. The piracetam analog can be administered in an amount between 0.1 and 100 mg kg day. The second compound, e.g. deanol or a compound which dissociates to form deanol, can be administered in an amount between 10 and 2,000 mg kg day. The piracetam analog and second compound, rather than being administered in one therapeutic composition, can be administered simultaneously olr near enough in time to.achieve the desired counteracting effect. When administered to a human e.g., orally, parenterally, intravenously, or by suppository the compositions of the invention can enhance brain function associated with acetylcholine containing brain neurons.
