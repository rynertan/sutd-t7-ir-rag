# Apparatus and methods for rolling and treating steel rod.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are provided for heat treatment of steel rod while being transported in overlapping ring form on a conveyor. In a method of controlled cooling the rod is deposited at high temperature onto a conveyor in spread out ring form and transported along a given path while being cooled by forc ing air against the rod from slots positioned adlacent thereto and extending transversely across said path and controlling the pressure and or volume of air supplied to the individual slots or groups of slots. Apparatus for carrying out such method may comprise a conveyor having mutually spaced driven carriers on which the rings are transported along a given path character ised in that heat resistant elements 46 are arranged beneath the path to define slots 48 which underlie the carriers and ex tend transversely across said path, conduits 40 communicate with said slots, means 32, 42 supply cooling air via said con duits and through said slots for application as concentrated jets directly against the undersides of the rings being transported thereon, and means associated with said conduits for varying the amount of air being supplied through said slots along the lengths thereof.
