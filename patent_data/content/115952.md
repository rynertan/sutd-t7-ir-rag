# Electron beam exposure method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An electron beam exposure system for producing a desired pattern on a workpiece 20 . The pattern is specified by pre determined pattern data. The pattern data is modified with cor rection data. The correction data is obtained from information indicating level variance of the surface of the workpiece 20 due to elastic deformation thereof during the exposure pro cess. With the use of the correction data, the desired pattern is correctly reproduced as intended when the workpiece is nor mally placed and the surface thereof recovers its flatness.
