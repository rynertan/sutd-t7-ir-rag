## Description
Process for carrying out an enzymatic reaction. The invention relates to a process for carrying out an enzymatic reaction in which an enzyme containing aqueous phase is contacted with a solution of a substrate in a water immiscible solvent. It was nown to carry out an enzymatic reaction in a biphasic system, for example from.U.S. Patent Specification 3,926,726. The purpose of the use of a biphasic system is to avoid the disadvantage of the generally low solubility of the substrate and of the product in aqueous medium. According to the above mentioned U.S.Patent Specification the enzyme is incorporated in a buffer to which, if desired, the relative coenzyme may be added as well, and this aqueous phase is dispersed in a water immiscible solvent in which the substrate is dissolved. Substrates used are mainly steroids, but olive oil and butanol have been mentioned as substrates as well. Esters and ethers, hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons have been suggested as organic solvents. In Biotechnology and Bioengineering XVIII, pages 815 826 1975 the conversion of cholesterol to cholest 4 en 3 one by means of whole cells of a Nocardia sp. is described. In this process the substrate was dissolved in an organic, water immiscible solvent carbon tetrachloride , and the micro organisms were suspended in a buffer. Although it is advantageous that the whole cells may be separated after completion of the reaction the enzyme activity is not maintained during long periods of time. In less than three days this activity falls to half the initial value after seven runs.Further disadvantages of the use of whole cells are the introduction of an additional resistance with respect to substance exchange by the cell wall, and the low specificity of the reaction caused by the presence of a variety of enzyme systems in the whole cell. The process according to U.S. Patent Specification 3,926,726 in which the solution of the enzyme system in a buffer is dispersed in the organic solvent has the disadvantage that the enzymes become inactivated rather quickly, especially in systems requiring coenzymes. It was also tried to limit the rapid decrease of the activity by immobilization of the enzymes. Thus, it is suggested in Biotechnology and Bioengineering XXI, pages 39 48 1979 to couple 20ss hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to CNBr activated Sepharose, to suspend the 206 HSDH Sepharose particles in a phosphate buffer containing also NAD , sodium pyruvate and LODE, and to shake this suspension with a solution of testosterone in ethyl acetate.Separate immobilization of the LDH by coupling to Sepharose was suggested as well. Also, 20ss HSDH and ADH have been used. A disadvantage of this method is that it is impossible to immobilize the total enzyme system, but only part thereof, and that, consequently, the components used in the reaction, namely the coenzyme used, have to be added continuously. It was found that the enzymatic reaction in which an enzyme containing aqueous phase is contacted with a solution of a substrate in a water immiscible solvent may be carried out easily and efficiently and, if desired continuously, if the enzyme containing aqueous phase is used in the form of a gel. Preferably, the gel is used in the form of small spheres. The gelling agents used for preparing the gel are the usual agents capable of gellifying an aqueous liquid. Examples of such gellifying agents are gelatin, agar and alginate. As the gel spheres are not exposed to an aqueous system, but to a water immiscible solvent it is not necessary to cross link the gel. This is highly advantageous because, generally, cross linking reactions will cause loss of enzyme activity. In aqueous solutions non cross linked gel spheres cannot be used generally, because they will either swell strongly or will dissolve. Non cross linked gel spheres possess, however, sufficient strength for use in the two phase system described herein.Moreover, all of the substances present in the gel spheres are hydrophilic, so that these will not diffuse to the organic phase even if they are not bonded chemically to the gel.The gel spheres may contain all of the substances necessary for the enzyme system, such as coenzymes, agents for the regeneration of the coenzyme, and buffer substances. However, the agents for the regeneration of the coenzyme may be added to the organic phase as well. The preparation of the enzyme containing gel spheres may be carried out for example as follows The polymer, for example gelatin or agar, is dissolved, in an amount sufficient for the gel formation, in a warm buffer solution the pH of which is in the optimum range for the enzyme system to be used. Generally, a phosphate buffer may be used, but other buffers not affecting the enzyme system, may be used. Further, substances having a stabilizing activity on the enzyme system used, such as albumin nay be added. The white of eggs, for example the white of hen s eggs may be added as well. This exerts a buffering as well as a stabilizing activity. Then the solution of the polymer in the buffer is cooled to a temperature just above the gelling point of the polymer.At this temperature the enzymes and coenzymes which may have been dissolved in a small amount of buffer, are added to the solution. Then the whole solution is poured, with agitation, into the organic solvent to be used in the two phase reaction, the temperature of the organic solvent being the same as that of the solution added. This operation results in a dispersion of small droplets in the organic phase. The dispersion is then cooled with agitation to a temperature below the gelling temperature, for example to 50 C, which results in the formation of gel spheres.Agitation of the spheres during some hours at low temperature hardens the spheres and will prevent sticking. If desired, the spheres may be separated from the dispersion and frozen. The frozen spheres may be stored for long periods of time at a temperature lower than 00 C without substantial loss of enzymatic activity. After thawing the spheres may be used again for the enzymatic reaction. The solvent to be used in the process according to the invention should be immiscible with water or aqueous solutions under the conditions generally used for enzymatic reactions. Preferably, however, the starting materials and the reaction products should be readily soluble in the organic solvent, so as to ensure the lowest possible volume to be processed. Further, the organic solvent should be insoluble in water or have a very low solubility in water because, otherwise, there ts a chance that the enzymes or enzyme systems will be denatured by the presence of the solvent in the aqueous phase. A slight amount of water may be soluble in the organic solvent. It is preferred to saturate the organic solvent with water so as to prevent extraction of water from the gelled aqueous phase.Also, the selection of the organic solvent depends on the possible inactivating influence of the solvent on the activity of the enzyme system. Examples of suitable organic solvents are water immiscible carboxylic alkyl esters, such as butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, amyl acetate, etc. ethers, sud as diethyl ether hydrocarbons, such as n hexane, cyclohexane, benzene or toluene halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride water immiscible alcohols, such as octanol l. The enzymatic reaction according to the invention may be carried out with a variety of substrates and enzyme systems. Of course, the application of the process makes sense only when the substrate and or the end product has have a better solubility in the organic solvent than in water, because only then the advantage of a lower volume is obtained. An important field wherein the process may be used is the field of enzymatic reactions with steroids the water solubility of which is generally low. Examples of such enzymatic reactions are the reduction of cortisone to 208 dihydro cortisone 4 pregnene 17a,20B,21 triol 3,11 dione and the oxidation of cholesterol to cholest 4 en 3 one. The reduction of cortisone to 2013 dihydrocortisone is described, among others, in Biotechnology and Bioengineering XVII, pages 1101 1108 1975 . Cortisone is reduced to 20ss dihydrocortisone 4 pregnene 17a,20 3,21 triol 3,ll dione under the influence of the enzyme 20ss hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 20ss XSDH . At the same time the coenzyme NADH is oxidized to NAD NADH reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide . The reaction proceeds according to the equation 1 Cortisone NADH EMI4.1 20ss dihydrocortisone NAD It would be rather expensive to use the necessary coenzyme NADH only once.This is the reason why the coenzyme is regenerated from NAD by oxidation of ethanol to ethanal under the influence of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase ADH . In this reaction the coenzyme NAD is reduced to NADH according to the equation 2 C2H50H NAD EMI5.1 CH3CH0 NADH H An excess of ethanol is used to shift the equilibrium 2 to the right, and ethanol may be removed from the reaction mixture by physical means for example by extraction with the organic solvent . The oxidation of cholesterol to cholest 4 en 3 one proceeds under the influence of cholesterol oxidase with oxygen air as the oxidation agent. An important advantage of the present process as compared with the use of an aqueous enzyme system dispersed in an organic solvent, such as described in U.S. Patent Specification 3,926,726 is the considerably longer life of the enzymes which, in accordance with the invention, are used in the form of a gelled aqueous solution. Generally, the stability of an enzyme or enzyme system dispersed in an aqueous buffer solution is in the order of a few days when it is in contact with an organic solvent. The half life of the activity of cholesterol oxidase and of 20ss HSDH ASH is in the order of one week. By using the process according to the invention a 10 fold increase of the life of the enzyme system may be obtained easily. When using the gellified enzyme phase the reaction rate will be generally lower than when a dispersed enzyme phase is used, but the total productivity of the enzyme system defined as the total amount of product obtained per unity of enzyme is considerably higher. The decrease of the reaction rate is caused by inhibition of transfer and limitation of diffusion of substrate and product into and from the sphere. These phenomena are highly dependent on various factors such as the dimensions and the solid content of the gel spheres, nature of the stabilization agents used and nature and molecular dimensions of substrate and product. The higher total productivity of the present enzyme system, inspite of the decreased reaction rate, is due to the considerably longer life of the enzyme system. For example, with the system 20ss HSDH ADH an about eight tlmes higher product yield may be ob tained with the process according to the invention than with the same amount of enzyme dispersed in the form of an aqueous solution in the organic solvent. As far as the regeneration of the coenzyme used is concerned the effectivity thereof may be expressed as the maximum number of regeneration cycles, that is to say the number of times the oxidized coenzyme may be converted to the reduced form and back to the oxidized form. For example, a maximum number of regeneration cycles of 50 corresponds with an effectivity yield per regeneration cycle of 95 . For the system 203 HSDH ADH with MADE and NADH as the coenzyme an increase of the maximum number of regeneration cycles by a factor 10 was found when using the gel spheres. As compared with the use of a non gellified aqueous phase, for example according to U.S. Patent Specification 3,926,726, the present process has the advantage that separation of the organic phase from the aqueous phase does not involve specific problems. When aqueous solutions are dispersed in organic solvents it may be difficult to separate the dispersions obtained, especially when proteins or other substances of high molecular weight are present.Regeneration of the enzyme phase then may be difficult in practice.These difficulties do not occur when a gellified aqueous phase is used. Further, an important advantage as compared with the use of a non gellified aqueous phase is that the process may be carried out easily in a continuous way, for example in a packed bed reactor.Example IReduction of cortisone to 20ss dihydrocortisone A gellified enzyme phase was prepared as follows Twenty z gelatin Bloom number 60 was added to 5 ml of eggwhite. This mixture was heated to a temperature of 40 60 C until the gelatin had dissolved. Then the mixture was cooled to a temperature of about 35 C in a few minutes. At this temperature the following was added to the egg white gelatin mixture 15 ul of a 20 flSDH suspension about 2.5 units , 0.5 mg of ADH about 250 units and 5 mg of NAD. Then the entire solution was poured into butyl acetate having a temperature of about 35 C, with stirring. The stirring was continued and the mixture was cooled as rapidly as possible in a few minutes to a temperature of 5 C the mixture was stirred during about two hours at the same temperature. A dispersion of non sticky gel spheres having a diameter of about 1 mm was obtained. The gellified enzyme phase obtained was then added to 50 ml of organic phase prepared by dissolving 50 mg of cortisone and 0.5 ml of ethanol 96 in 50 ml of butyl acetate saturated about 10 ml l with water. The spheres where maintained in suspension by agitation at a temperature of 50 C. The organic phase was replenished every 24 hours and the conversion obtained in 24 hours was determined by analysis of the components of the organic phase removed. The analysis was effected by thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . The results are given in the attached Figure 1 curve 1 . In the above mentioned way also gelatin spheres were prepared starting from 5 ml of 0.05 molar KH2P04 Na2HP04 buffer pH 7 instead of egg white to which 20 of gelatin had been added.These enzyme spheres were also tested in the above mentioned way.The results are given in Figure 1 curve 2 . For comparison an enzyme phase was prepared by dispersing the same amounts of HSDH, ADH, NED as above with 7.5 mg of albumin in 5 ml of 0.05 molar KH2P04 Na2HP04 buffer pH 7 . This enzyme phase was dispersed in 50 ml of the same organic phase. In this test the organic phase was also replenished every 24 hours. The results are also given in Figure 1 curve 3 . The results show that a considerable increase of the life is obtained with the process according to the invention. The above described reaction according to the invention was also carried out in a completely continuous way in a so called packed bed reactor. For this purpose 50 g about 50 ml of gelatin spheres having the following total composition were prepared in the above described way 10 g of gelatin 40 g of egg white neutralized to pH 7 with lactic acid 75 pl of an HSDH suspension about 12.5 units 25 mg of ADH 5 mg of NAD A column having a height of about 15 cm and a diameter of about 2.5 cm was filled with these spheres. A solution of 0.5 g l of cortisone and 10 ml l of ethanol in butyl acetate was passed continuously through the so obtained packed bed reactor at a rate of 3 ml hour. The conversion in the reactor was determined every day by analysis of the components of the product stream. The results are given in Figure 2 as 1 . The results show that the reactor has been active during 130 days, in which period the conversion decreased gradually from 100 to 0 . In this way a total amount of 2320 mg of cortisone was converted which conversion needed only 5 mg of NAD coenzyme . Consequently, as far as the used WAD is concerned, a total number of 860 regeneration cycles was reached. The same test was carried out with calcium alginate based gel spheres. These were prepared as follows 75 ul of an ESDE suspension about 12.5 units 25 mg of ,4DH 5 mg of NAD, and 1 g of sodium alginate were dissolved in 50 g of egg white neutralized to pH 7 with lactic acid at room remperature. This solution was added dropwise to a stirred 0.5 calcium chloride solution and stirring was continued for about 15 minutes. The calcium alginate gel spheres so obtained were separated, rinsed with water and brought into a packed bed reactor. In the way described above for gelatin spheres substrate solution was passed continuously through the reactor. The conversion in the reactor uas also determined every day. The results are given in Figure 2 as 2 . The results show that, as far as the activity is concerned, the performance of the enzyme system in calcium alginate based gel spheres is principally identical with that of a system in gelatin based spheres. Probably, the reason for the lower conversion in calcium alginate is the larger dimensions of the spheres causing a higher substrate transfer resistance.Example IIOxidation of cholesterol to cholest 4 en 5 one Gelatin spheres containing egg white were prepared in accordance with the procedure described in Example I. The following enzymes were added to 5 g of spheres. 2.5 units of cholesterol oxidase 1000 units of catalase. The gellified enzyme phase was added to an organic phase consisting of a solution of 50 mg of cholesterol in 50 ml of toluene, and was kept in suspension by agitation at a temperature of 5 C.Oxygen was continuously passed through the suspension via a capillary. The organic phase was replenished every 24 hours and the conversion obtained in 24 hours was determined by thin layer chromatography and analysis of the components of the organic phase removed. The results are given in Figure 3. Agar based gel spheres 5 solution in phosphate buffer pH 7 were prepared in a way identical with that described in Example I for gelatin spheres. The enzymes cholesterol oxidase and catalase were added to the gel spheres in the same concentration as above, and the conversion of cholesterol to cholestenone with these gel spheres was determined in an identical way. The results are also given in Figure 3. For comparison an enzyme phase was prepared by dispersing the same amounts of cholesterol oxidase and catalase in 5 ml of 0.05 molar KH2P04 Na2HP04 buffer pH 7 . This enzyme phase was dispersed in 50 ml of the same organic phase. In this test the organic phase was also replenished every 24 hours. The results are stated in Figure 3 as well. The results show that a considerable increase of the life is obtained with the gellified system. Example rti Oxidation of testosterone to androst 4 ene 3,17 dioe testosterone NAD EMI10.1 androst 4 ene 3,17 dione NADH H ethanal NADH H EMI10.2 ethanol NAD testosterone ethanalEMI10.3 androst 4 ene 3 ,17 dione ethanol Gelatin spheres containing egg white were prepared according to the procedure described in Example I. The following enzymes were added per 2.5 g of spheres 5 mg of 17 HSDH about 12 units 5 mg of ADH about 2000 units 5 tag of WAD The gellified phase was added to an organic phase consisting of 22.5 ml of a solution of testosterone in water saturated butyl acetate 0.5 g of testosterone per liter of butyl acetate . Also 250 ul of ethanal were added to the organic phase. The gellified enzyme phase was kept in suspension by agitation at a temperature of 5 C.The organic phase was replenished every 24 hours and the conversion obtained in 24 hours was determined by thin layer chromatography and analysis of the components of the organic phase removed. The results are given in Figure 4 curve 1 l. For comparison an enzyme phase was prepared by dispersing the same amounts of 17 HSDH, ADH and NAD in 2.5 ml of 0.05 molar KH2P04 NazHP04 buffer pH 7 . The enzyme phase was dispersed in 22.5 ml of the same organic phase. The organic phase was replenished every 24 hours in this test as well. The results are given inFigure 4 curve 2 . The results show that the gellified system has a considerably longer life and, consequently, a higher productivity than the nongellified system. example IVStorage tests with a gelatin based enzyme preparation The enzyme preparation described in Example and based on gelatin with egg white was subjected to a storage test at various temperatures. The activity of the preparation after storage during a certain period of time and at a certain temperature was determined by measuring, according to Example I, the conversion of cortisone to dihydrocortisone in a batch wise test after 24 hours. The results of these tests are given in Figure 5. Curve 1 relates to the change of the activity with time, expressed as percentage of the initial activity, after storage at 10 C curve 2 represents the same at 5 C, and curve 3 represents the same at 20 C. This shows that a preparation according to the invention can be stored during a long period of time more than one year and, consequently, may be reused.
