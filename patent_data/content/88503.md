# PHOTOGRAMMETRIC COMPUTER AIDED METHOD FOR PLANT CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
Structural details of industrial plants are derived from stereo pair photographs by analysing the structure into basic 3D unit shapes. The information is stored in a data store and may be obtained by interrogation of the store, as a direct print out through a graphics display, or via an inter faced graphic display system, such as PDMS. Plant struc tural designs can be readily modified by altering the basic unit shapes within the data store and or their parameters.
