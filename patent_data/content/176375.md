# Synchronized document feed for electrophotographic imaging copier apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an electrostatic copying machine 10 which includes means for moving a patterned member 26 along the top wall 16 of the copying machine 10 in synchronism with the movement of said rotary electrophotographic member 250 comprising a pair of engaged rollers 316,318 having a nip, the top wall 16 having a window 190 against which the patterned member 26 is adapted to be pressed and moved by said engaged rollers 316, 318 to be progressively illuminated and projected, one of said rollers being coupled to be driven by drive means, means for applying power to said electric motor 50 to start rotation of the rollers 316, 318 and rotary electrophotographic member 250 simul taneously, the engaged rollers 316,318 being disposed at the top of the housing whereby a member 26 may be pressed into said nip while the motor 50 is not energized and neither the electrophotographic member 250 nor the one of said engaged rollers 316, 318 is rotating, at which time the electric motorway 50 may be energized manually causing synchronized movement of the patterned members 26 and the electrophotographic member 250 .
