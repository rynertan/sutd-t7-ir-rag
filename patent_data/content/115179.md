# Virtual memory address translation mechanism with combined hash address table and inverted page table.

## Abstract
A virtual memory address translation mechanism is provided for converting virtual memory addresses provided by a CPU into real memory addresses within page frames in a large hierachial memories wherein the real memory space is substantially smaller than the scope of the virtual memory. The conversion or translation mechanism includes a combined table in the memory which includes a first list covering the respective virtual address of each memory address Inverted Page or IPT and a second list connecting each of a plurality of hashed addresses with a predetermined initial virtual address of a linked group of virtual addresses, each of which when hashed produces the connected hashed address Hashed Addressed Table, HAT . The system also has means for hashing a selected virtual address to produce a hashed address. Also included in apparatus for sequentially searching through the linked group of virtual addresses in the combined table until a selected virtual address is located as well as apparatus responsive to the location of a particular selected virtual address for accessing from the first list, the real memory address of the located virtual address.
