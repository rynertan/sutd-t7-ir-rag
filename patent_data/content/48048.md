# Heat exchanger having a plurality of vertical pipes for upward passage of a first heat exchanging medium.

## Abstract
Heat exchanger having a plurality of vertical pipes for upward passage of a first heat exchanging medium, at least one compartment for passage of a second heat exchanging medium through which compartment said pipes extend, a lower chamber through which said first medium passes a into which said pipes open for admission to the pipes of said first medium, and a flow distribution element adapted to distribute the flow of said first medium in said lower chamber to the pipes. A fluidisable particulate material is in operation, is maintained in a fluidised state in the pipes by the flow of the first medium. The pipes have inlet elements extending downwardly into said lower chamber with their lowermost ends open. Stabilisation openings are provided into said inlet elements above said open lowermost ends thereof. To prevent blocking of the stabilisation openings by dirt, these are separated, outside the inlet elements, from the said open lowermost ends of the inlet elements by at least one screen which allows flow of the first medium to the stabilisation openings.
