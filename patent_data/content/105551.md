# Method for the detinning of painted tinplate waste.

## Abstract
Detinning of tinplate waste is carried out by electrolysis with the waste acting as an anode immersed in an electroly tic bath containing NaOH. When detinning painted tinplate waste, in order to reduce the effect of the paint on the detinning process, the painted tinplate waste is first com pressed, then immersed in an NaOH solution for sufficient time to allow the NaOH to soften the paint, and then the electrolysis is carried out in the same or a different solution, to remove the tin beneath the paint. Preferably the softened paint is not removed from the tinplate.
