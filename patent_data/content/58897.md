# Oxygen sensing element having barrier layer between ceramic substrate and solid electrolyte layer.

## Abstract
An oxygen sensing element having a ceramic sub strate 12 , a layer 22 of an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte such as zirconia containing a stabilizing oxide such as yttria, and a pair of electrode layers 18, 20 formed on one side of the solid electrolyte layer 22 so as to be spaced from each other. To prevent a signi ficant change in the output characteristic of the element caused by diffusion of the stabilizing oxide from the solid electrolyte layer 22 into the ceramic substrate 12 , there is a barrier layer 16 which intervenes be tween the substrate 12 and the solid electrolyte layer 22 at least in a region between the two electrode layers 18, 20 . The barrier layer 16 is formed of a ceramic material such as the above mentioned solid electrolyte or a metal such as platinum, or has a double layer structure consisting of a metal layer in direct con tact with the substrate 12 and an outer layer formed of a ceramic material.
