# A PROCESSOR ARRAY

## Abstract
A processor array comprises a plurality of identical pro cessing elements 18, 28 etc. each capable of combining oper ands to produce results and, after arithmetic operations, carry data. Each element comprises means for selecting the element from which it takes an input, which may be an operand or carry data. This enables the array to be configured in a ver satile manner to form composite processing units. Amongst those possible are a cyclic 10 bit shift register 22, a 9 bit ripple carry adder 20, one bit processing units 28 for bit serial pro cessing, a two bit ripple carry adder 26 and a two element unit 24 whose elements exchange data.
