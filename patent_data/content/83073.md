## Description
Object of this invention are new catalyst components for the polymerization of alpha oleN ins and of mixtures thereof with minor amounts of ethylene and the catalyst obtained therefrom. More particularly, the invention refers to new catalv tic components obtained from emulsions or dispersions in an inert liquid medium or in an inert gaseous phase of a liquid phase comprising compounds or compositions contain ing Ti and Mg compounds, which are immiscible in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and the use of the catalysts obtained therefrom in the polymerization of alpha olefins CH2 CHR in which R is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, particularly propylene, or of mixtures thereof with minor amounts of ethylene. It is known that the coordination catalysts commonly used in the industrial practice are heterogeneous systems obtained by reaction of a transition metal compound gene rally a Ti halide with an organometal compound of the me tals of Groups l III of the Periodic System. The transition metal compound used for the preparation of the catalyst is generally a solid insoluble in the hydrocarbon polymerization medium or is a liquid soluble in said medium. Homogeneous coordination catalysts soluble in the polymerization medium at least before the polymerizatior is started are also known. These systems, however, have not been adopted in the industrial practice because of the fact that the activity thereof, that st tho beginning is also very high, decreased rapidly and this does not allow to obtain high polymer yields. Within the field of heterogeneous catalysts1 supported catalysts have beenadopted in the industrial practice already since some time, which are endowed of so high activity as to allow to avoid the expensive depuration treatments of the polymer from the catalytic residues.These catalysts are generally obtained from a catalytic com ponent comprising a titanium compound supported on a magne sium halide in active form. Catalysts supported on Mg halides endowed of both high activity a stereospecificity that are suitable for the stereoregular polymerization of propylene and simiiar alpha oleflns are also known. These catalysts comprise in general a titanium compound supported on a Mg halide in ac tive form, modified with electron donor compounds. In the modern industrial processes using high yield supported catalysts the requirement is felt of being in po sition to have available catalysts having a controlled morphology and particle size, which be capable to yield a polymer in form of particles which maintain the morphology and the particle size of the catalyst and that, furthermore, be endowed with a high flowability and bulk density A catalyst having these characteristics shows advanta ges not onl during polymerization and makes easier the sub sequent operations of transfer and or treatment of the polymer but can also allow to eliminate the granulation step of the polymer, this operation being one that, as it Sis known, requires large amounts of energy. The methods employed until now for the preparation of catalysts having a controlled morphology and or particle Si ze are based on operations expensive per se, which comprise the preformation of a precursor of the catalytic component in form of particles having a controlled morphology and the subsequent transformation of these particles to obtain the true catalytic component or the precipitation of the cataly tic component in conditions in general very critical, follow ed by the operations of separation, washing and drying of the solid. According to otner methods, precursors of the catalytic component in the melted state are emulsified in an inert immiscible liquid and the emulsion is then subjected to quenching to obtain the solidification of the dispersed liquid phase which is subsequently treated for the transformation thereof in catalytic component. Examples of these methods are described in the applicant s U.S. patent 3,953,414 and Belgian patent 878,347. Coordination catalysts are not known hitherto wherein the component comprising the transition metal compound, con sisting of a liquid immiscible in the conventional solvents used in the polymerization processes, be employed in emulsion and dispersion form in said liquid medium. It has been now unexpectedly found that it is possible to obtain catalysts. suitable to produce crystalline polymers of title alpha olefins and crystalline copol ymers thereof with minor amounts of ethylene, in the form of particles having controlled morphology and or particle size, by carrying out the preparation of the catalytic component comprising the transition metal compound by startin√ß from emulsions or dispersions in an inert liquid medium or in an inert gas phase of a liquid phase comprising compounds or compositions containing Ti and F1g compounds that are immiscible in the normal aliphatic hydrocarbons or comprising a precursor of the catalytic component which is also immiscible in the aliphatic hydrocarbons. The transformation of the above indicated emulsions or dispersions in the catalytic component having controlled morphology andior particle size takes place by reactions which involve the formation of a solid phase comprising a titanium compound supported on a magnesium halide. Preferably and in order to endow the catalyst of a higher stereospecificity, it is worked in conditions wherein the solid phase obtained by transformation of the di spersed liquid phase comprises also an electron donor compound. Electron donor compounds suitable for this purpose are well known in the literature. As example can be cited the compounds described in the applicant s U.S. patents 4,107,414 and 4,107,418. Other examples are described in the applicantls European patent applications 81 106301, 81 106300 and 81 106299. Any reaction that leads tca formation of a solid pha se comprising a titanium compound supported on a magnesium halide is suitable for the transformation of the above dc scribed emulsions or dispersions. Examples of known reactions are those wherein the Ti and Mg components forming the dispersed liquid phase are ma de to react with an Al alkyl compound having formula ALRmXn wherein R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical containing from 1 to 28 carbon atoms X is a halogen m is a number comprised between 1 and 3 n is a number comprised between zero and 2. According to other methods, the Ti and Mg compounds comprising also an Al halide are made to react with compounds such as for example diisoamyl ether, alkyl arylether such as for example anisol that are capable of forming complexes with the Al halide but not with the Mg halide. Al already indicated, any compound or composition com prising Ti and Mg compounds that is immiscible in aliphatic hydrocarbons is suitable for the formation of emulsions or dispersions employable for the preparation of the catalytic components of the invention. Similarly, any precursor of the catalytic components that in the liquid state is immiscible in aliphatic hydrocarbons is suitable for the preparation of the emulsions or dispersions from which to obtain the catalytic component. Examples of compounds or compositions and methods of preparation thereof, that are suitable for obtaining the emulsions and suspensions are as follows. Anhydrous magnesium halide, in particular MgCl2, is made to react with an anhydrous aluminum halide, in particu lar AlC13, in an aromatic hydrocarbon, in particular toluene in the presence of a halogenated hydrocarbon, preferably 1,2 dichloroethane. To the cily liquid thus obtained now immiscible in the same aromatic hydrocarbon a titanium coin pound, in particular TiC14, is added. An oily liquid is obtained that is immiscible ir the common aliphatic hydrocarbons. More particularly, the Mg and Al halides and the aromatic hydrocarbons are made to react at the reflux tempera ture of the aromatic hydrocarbon in the Mg Al toluene molar ratio of 1 3 To this suspension the halogenated hydrocarbon is added in the ratio of about 2 mols per mol of Mg halide and it is heated until an oily liquid is formed. Then the Ti compound is added in a Ti halide Mg halide molar ratio com prised in general between 0.1 1 and 1 1. The oily liquid that is obtained before the addition of the Ti compound is in itself a precursor of the catalytic component that can be emulsified and the emulsion be treated for the transformation to catalytic component. In the above indicated preparation the Al trihalide can be substituted by an alkyl Al dihalide, the toluene by benzene, xylene and by similar aromatic hydrocarbons 1,2 dichloroethane can be substituted by C2H5C1, C3H7Cl, n C4H9Cl, s C4H9Cl, t C4H9Cl, C6H5Cl, CHCl3, C6H5CH2Cl.CH3C12 and by similar alkyl or aryl halides. Another method of preparation consists of dissolving an anhydrous Mg halide in a li tetraalcoholate, in particu lar Ti tetrabutylate and ol making an anhydrous gaseous hydrohalogenic acid to flo iri the solution until separation of an oily phase. According to a modification of the above described method, the hydrohalogenic acid can be replaced by an acryl halide, in particular acetyl chloride. The butyl acetate that is formed is partly removed until formation of an oily liquid. Other compounds suitable for the preparation of the emulsions or suspensions from which the catalytic components of the invention are obtained, can be selected from the com pounds having the formula MgX2 TiXpYq n ED that in the liquid state be immiscible in aliphatic hydro carbons. In the formula X is a halogen atom Y is a OR radical in which R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group con taining from 1 to 18 carbon atoms p is a number from 1 to 4 q is a number from zero to 3 p q 4 n is a number from 3 to 6 ED is an electron donor compound selected in particular from the esters of carboxylic aliphatic or aromatic acids. Examples of these compounds are MgCl2 TiCl4 4Ac Ac CH3COOC2H5 , MgCl2 tiCl2 4 EB EB ethylbenzoate , MgCl2 TiCl2 OC2H5 2 4C2H5OH, MgCl2 TiCl4 5 POCl3. These compounds are prepared according to known me thods, by dissolving tn Mg halide in the ED compound, by adding to the solution the stoichiometric amount of the Ti compounds and by then causing the reaction to take place at reflux. The excess of ED compound is at the end removed by evaporation. The precursors of the catalytic components are selected in general from the adducts of the Mg halides comprising an electron donor compound, in particular an aliphatic, cy cioaliphatic or alkylaryl alcohol. Adducts of this type and the methods of preparation thereof are known in the literature. These adducts are n general solids at room temperature but have a relatively low melting point. The are emulsified, in the liquid state, in an inert liquid the emulsion ic then made to react, according to known methods, with reagents capable of transforming the ad duct in active catalytic component. Examples of transformation reactions to catalytic component are those wherein the adduct is made to react directly with TiCl4 or, before the reaction with TiC14, is made to react with an Al alkyl compound or with halogenated silicon compounds such as SiCl4 and halosilanes. These and other reactions are described in the Belgian patents 857,574 and 878,347. In order to improve the stereospecificity of the catalyst, the reactions are carried out in the presence of an electron donor compound capable of forming adducts with the Mg halide. The emulsifying of the liquid Ti compounds as well as of the precursors can be carried out according to known tech niques. Preferably the transition metal compound is dispersed into an oil of parafinic, napiitiienic, aromatic oi sil co nic type and then subjected to the trar.sformat2or reactions. Examples of these oils are Silicon oil Baysilon M 100 Bayer , vaselin OB 55 ROL , Cortis OB 55 oil Total ,Circosol 2XH oil Sunoco and butre. R 55 oil Shell . In some cases, in particular when the emulsion were unstable in the time, it has been found convenient to prepolymerize small amounts of ethylene or other olefin. The prepolymerization is carried out in general until a few grams of polymer 1 100 g per gram of catalytic component are formed. The obtained prepolymer is then treated with an ether solution in an aromatic hydrocarbon in order to obtain the active catalytic component. In some cases it proved convenient to cause the adsorption of the immiscible liquid phase used for the preparation of the emulsions or dispersions, to take place on a porous inert support having predetermined geometric form andior particle size distribution. The solid is then suspended in an inert liquid medium, that is immiscible with the adsorbed liquid phase and the suspension is then treated for the transformation to the catalytic component. The co catalsts usable with the catalytic components of the invention to obtain the catalysts for the polymerization, according to known methods, of alpha olefins and of mixtures thereof with minor amounts of ethylene comprise hl alkl compounds such as Al trialkyl, hydrides of Al alkyl and, preferably, electron donor compounds which, as it ic known, improve the stereospecificic characteristics of the caralytic system. Examples of Al alkSl compounds are Al tri ethyl, Al triisobutyl, Al tri n butyl.Examples 1 4 1 Preparation of emulsifiable liquid A. Tht emulsifiable liquid employed in all examples 1 4 was prepared in the following conditions and modalities. 44.07 g of anhydrous MgC12, 199 g of anhydrous AlCl3, 640 cc of anhydrous toluene and 80 cc of dehydrated 1,2 dichloroethane were introduced into a flask fitted with stirrer, dropping funnel, reflux condenser and ther niometer, after previously flushing with nitrogen. The suspension was heated to 110 C and maintained at this temperature for 2 hours. The suspension was then cooled to room temperature and filtered 765 cc of a red brow nish oily liquid were obtained. 2 Emulsifying of liquid A. The device for the emulsifying of liquid A comprised a Keller type flask fitted with dropping funnel and thermo meter, in which a turbostirrer turning at a speed of 12,000 r.p.m. was inserted. The control of the temperature was carried out by im mersion of the flask in a methanol dry ice cooling sy stem. Silicon oil Baysilon M 100 of Bayer and n butyl ether were introduced into the flask, after a previous flushing thereof with nitrogen. Then liquid A to which TiC14 was previously added was fed under the highest stirring while cooling simultaneously, within 5 minutes and while maintaining the temperature at the desired va lue. The stirring was continued for another 10 minutes. The data of the preparation are reported in Table 1.3 Heaction with A1 C H and prepolymerization. The whole volume of the emulsion prepared in 2 was trans ferred within the time of about 3 minutes to a flask fitt ed with dropping funnel and thermoregulated, wherein a 500 cc hexane solution containing each time the amount of A1 C2H5 3 TEA equal to the Al Ti ratio reported in Ta ble 1 was previously introduced. The reaction temperatu re is also reported in Table. In the resulting suspension ethylene was flowed for g few minutes in order to remove nitrogen and then the flask was pressurized with ethyle ne at an over pressure of 20 60 mmH , for a time of 30 minutes. A prepolymer was recovercd that was then wash ed with hexane and dried under vacuum at 50 C for 3 hours.4 Polymerization of propylene. The polymerization tests were carried out in a 2.5 liter autoclave fitted witij Sirrer and thermocouple. 1000 cc of an hexane suspensior containing the amounts of Al tri ethyl and phenyltriethoxysilane FES indicated in Table 2 were introduced under nitrogen atmosphere into the autoclave previously heated at 60 OC. The autoclave was then closed, hydrogen was introduced up to a pressure of 0.2 atm., the temperature was ln crease to 70 C and propylene was introduced up to G pressure of 7 atm. The pressure was maintained constant during the polymerization by feeding the monomer conti nuously. After 4 hours the test was interrupted the so lid polymer was separated from the solvent by filtration and then dried under a nitrogen flow at 70 C. In all tests the polymer was present in form of particles hav ing a controlled morphology and particle size. The per formance of the catalyst and other characteristics of the polymer are reported in Table 2. The isotacticity index reported in Table 2 is related to a polymer insoluble in the polymerization medium.
