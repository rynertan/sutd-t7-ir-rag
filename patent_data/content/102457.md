# Device for measuring of concentration.

## Abstract
A device for measuring of the concentration of a low molecular weight compound in a complex medium, which comprises a dialyzer 1 , an enzyme rector 2 and a measuring unit 3 in communication with each other through a channel system. Furthermore, the device comprises a valving means a , which is adapted to alternatingly direct the complex medium and the calibration solution, respectively, to the dialyzer 1 such that it is possible to calibrate the measuring unit at intervals during the proper measurement. The valving means is preferably composed of a valve pan 13 , which is movable between two positions, and a fixed valve part 14 , whereby one end 13a of the movable valve part conveniently is releasably attached to a corres ponding end 14a of the fixed valve part. By simply turning the valving means from its one position to its other it is possible to perform calibration of the measuring unit even during every individual measuring of the low molecular weight compound in the complex medium.
