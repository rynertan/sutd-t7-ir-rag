# Process for preparing linear polyesters, and shaped articles obtained therefrom.

## Abstract
UV stable linear polyesters, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate, contain in their chain copolymerised 2 hydroxy di hydroxyalkoxy benzophenone. The polyesters are useful for making biaxially oriented films. The polyesters can be made by polycondensation in the presence of 2,4,4 trihydroxybenzophenone.
