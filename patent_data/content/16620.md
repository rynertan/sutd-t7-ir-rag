# Electro optical character generator for photocomposing apparatus.

## Abstract
A character generator for use in photocomposing com prises a fibre optic faceplate 23 of which the front face is polished and bevelled at its leading and trailing edges. On the rear surface of the faceplate is a mask which has an array of apertures each aperture encompassing a multiplicity of the fibres. Photo emissive diodes or other illuminators 25 are approximately aligned with the holes in the mask and are disposed for connection to terminals 22 on a printed circuit mounting. The generator is intended for use in the constitu tion of characters by selective illumination of elementary areas. The faceplate is intended to be in close proximity to a film or other radiation sensitive recording medium which is moved relative to the faceplate to build up lines of composi tion.
