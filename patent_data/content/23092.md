# Abnormal condition sensing method and monitor system for use with machine tools.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is an abnormal condition sensing monitor system for use in conjunction with machine tools, such as automatic press apparatus 1 . Means for sensing 6, 7 an abnormal condition of the machine tool 1 is provided in the vicinity of an essential portion of the machine tool 1 . When a signal indicative of abnormal condition is outputted from the sensing means 6, 7 a signal processing circuit 9 is actuated. In response to an output obtained from the signal processing circuit 9 , the operation of the machine tool 1 is halted by means of a control circuit 12 or an alarm device, such as a lamp 13 , is actuated to warn of the abnormal condition of the machine tool 1 . Both the control circuit 12 and the alarm device 13 are connected to the signal processing circuit 9 , and either of these is actuated depending upon a level of the signal obtained from the sensing means 6, 7 .
