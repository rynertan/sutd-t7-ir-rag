# Ultrasonic wave Tomographic Imaging System.

## Abstract
An apparatus for the ultrasonic imaging of faults focuses an acoustic image, located internally of an object 3 , onto an ultrasonic receiving means 23 to produce the image of a desired fault present within the object 3 . The apparatus includes means 110 for transmitting ultra sonic waves in such a manner as to scan the desired fault within the object, thereby assuring that ultrasonic waves will not be transmitted toward such portions of the object as need not be scanned. The apparatus further includes gate means 150 which causes the ultrasonic receiving means 23 to receive the acoustic image corresponding to a scan in accordance with the scanning operation per formed by the ultrasonic wave transmitting means 110 . This eliminates reception of acoustic images other than those of the desired faults to improve the quality of the fault image.
