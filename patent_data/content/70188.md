# An analyzer for distillable materials.

## Abstract
An analyzer for the rapid determination of changes in the volatile composition of a distillable material and which can be used on line and requires no moving parts, comprises means for providing a sample of the material at critical flow conditions, means for isenthalpically flash expanding said sample so as to achieve a temperature difference of at least 5 DEG F across the expansion, means for maintaining the pressure on the downstream side of the expansion at a value which does not vary by more than about 20 , preferably 10 , and means for measuring the temperature of the sample before and after expansion.
