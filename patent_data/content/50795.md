# Method and apparatus for reclaiming metals from metallic scrap material.

## Abstract
Metallic scrap contaminated with combustibles is melted in a reverberatory melting furnace 11 having two communicating wells 20, 21 one being an enclosed sidewell 21 , which is the receiving well for scrap material during melting, and the other being an enclosed main holding well 20 for molten metal. The main well 20 has burner means 17, 18, 19 to provide heat for melting the metal and treating the scrap material. Heat from molten metal flowing between the main well 20 and the sidewell 21 produces exhaust gases by vaporizing the combustibles of the scrap material. An external passage 48 circulates the exhaust gases from the sidewell 21 to the main well 20 for incineration by the main well s burner means 17, 18, 19 . The external passage has an eductor means 50 which draws the exhaust gases from the sidewell 21 and propels them towards the main well 20 .
