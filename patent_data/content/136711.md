A document processing system including a novel control structure having separated supervisory and document func tions. The document functions, including a document buffer 54 and document access control means 60 , are the sole means for accessing documents. The document function routines 42 are selected from a predetermined library of such routines. The system includes a flexible, expandable document structure 32 incorporating information item blocks 86 and indexing blocks related through pointers. A new structure of the bus for conducting the documents and the routines between system memory and workstations is disclosed.
