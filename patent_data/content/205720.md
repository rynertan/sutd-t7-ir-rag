## Description
A CT SCANNER FOR RADIATION TERAPHYThe present invention relates to a method and device of making photon CT images with the patient in the radiation teraphy position by subjecting the patient to the peraphy radiation beam. The photon radiation used for taking the CT images is also used for the teraphy radiation. At first the CT images are taken and are computer processed and then, some minutes later while the patient still is resting on the patient couch, the radiation teraphy is performed. This method is generally known from Med.Phys.9 4 , July Aug 1982, Am. Asoc. Phys. Med.wherein R.G. Siompson et al. in a technical report entitled etA 4 MV CT scanner for radiation teraphy The prototype system. is describing the novel concept referred to above.In the known system a flat fan like photon beam is directed towards the partient and a photon detector array, placed under the patient 5 couch, is providing electrical signals representing the photon transmission along a sectional view of the patient s body. The gantry, which provides the fan like photon beam, is rotated in small steps around the patient s body and for each gantry setting the electrical signals are stored in a computer which out of the date so collected forms a CT image of the sectional view of the patient. The main advantage with this known concept is that no separate diagnostic energy CT scanner is required. Morover, the contrast to the images obtained with the known 4 MV CT scanner is improved, particularly the contrast to body tissue, Also the dose planning is more accurate.Previously the attenuation coefficients of the tissue, taken with diagnostic radiation energy of typically 70 keV has to be extrapolated to those expected to be present at the tereaphy radiation energies, which typically may be in the order of abut 5 MeV. An estrapolation over such a wide range is uncertain.Before the Simpson consept was desired conventinally the teraphy treatment was preceded by an X ray screening performed by a conventional CT scanner in order to localize the tumor volume. Thereafter the patient was moved to the couch of a teraphy apparatus the radiation field of which was set by a collimator on basis of the CT image. Apparently the coordinate system of the teraphy apparatus is different from what of the CT scanner making it difficult to exactly position the teraphy apparatus on the tumor volume. With the Simpson concept such positioning arrows of the tumor volume are obviated.The Simpson CT scanner referred to above have some inherent drawbacks among which the following are apparent The flat, broad fan like beam radiates a slice of the patient s body simultaneously implying that a detector included in the detector ray under the patent s couch further to electrones which pass the volyme immediately above the detector and secondary electrones generated by said volume also will detect secondary electrones generated in the volume surrounding said volume immedately above the said detector.This degrades the resolution of the final CT image. Dynamic radiation treatment of the tumor volume to the desired dose rate is difficult to perform. While rotating the gantry of the treatment apparatus the field collimator must be continuously readjusted to adapt its field to the shape of the tumor volume as seen from the gantry. The radiation is of a specific energy 4 MeV . Should a different energy be used then a different beam flattening filter must be used. Such beam flattening filters further to being large and heavy unevitable absorbs the high energy electrones included in the primary beam from the accelerator.The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for reducing the deficiences inherent in the known Simpson CTscanner, particularly The resolution of the CT image should be improved, dynamic radiation treatment should be possible to perform in an easy way, a spectrum of different radiation energies should be available thereby making it possible to take CT images at a desired beam energy without using beam flattening filters which inevitable absorbs the high energy electrones, that is exactly those electrones which in accordance with the present invention should be used to make the CT images.The above objects of the invention are achieved with a method and device as defined in the accompanying patent claims.A preferred embodiment of the invention should be described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the absorbtion cross section for diferent tissues versus the energy of the photon beam,Fig. 2 is an end view of the apparatus in accordance with the present invention,Fig. 3 schematically shows the electrical signal obtained at the photon detector array for the specific position Fig. 3a of the scanned beam in accordance with the present invention, and for the next following position Fig. 3b of the scanning beam,Fig. 4 is a corresponding electrical signal obtained at the photon detector of the known Simpson device and this figure has been incorporated in order to illustrate the differences between the known device and that of the present invention,Fig. 5 illustrates the format in which position and photon transmission data are stored in the memory of a micro computer, andFig. 6 illustrates a block diagram of the apparatus in accordance with the present invention. In Fig. 1 the absorption curves for bone, muscles and fatty tissues respectively are shown for varying photon energies.When the difference between the attanuation of the radiation in e.g. bone and fatty tissues is large, indicated with vertical double edged arrows, then the contrast of the CT image taken at the indicated radiation energi, is large. The larger the contrast the better the image quality. From Fig. 1 and the left vertical arrow it is apparent why conventional CT scanners are operating with an acceleration voltage of less than about 1 MV. From the right vertical arrow in Fig. 1 it is also apparent that for radiation energies over about 50 MV the contrast is high. The Simpson concept referred to above did take advantage of this fact.Moreover, the dose planning, as suggested by Simpson, was more accurate since the CT image taken with this high energy radiation showed exactly how the organs within the body absorbed the radiation and from this CT image it was possible to compute the real attenuation coefficients of the organs without relying on extrapolation from 70 kV CT images to teraphy radiation energies in the order of 4 MV and above. Such extrapolation is commonly done with the aid of curves similar to that shown in Fig. 1.In Fig. 2 there is shown a principal set up of the apparatus in accordance with the present invention. From a gantry 1 a patient 2 resting on a patient s couch 3 is radiated with a pencil like, well united, beam 4 of photons, some of which 5, penetrates the body and are detected by a detector array 6. A proton beam generated by an accelerator not shown, e.g. a race track microtron, enters the gantry 1 which comprises a pair of scanning electromagnets 7 which are energized by a varuing dc current in order to scan the proton beam in the plane of the drawing between the end of positions shown in broken lines. The scanning system is preferably of the kind described in our U.S. Patent Serial No. 4 442 352. Generally at the scanning centre 8 of the proton beam there is a target 9 of tantal or other metarial known per se which produces photons of generally the same energy as that of the proton beam. Further down in the gantry there is a transmission ion chamber 10 measuring the beam current and a pair of collimator blocks 11 for beam collimation.The beam is pulsed which means it comprises pulses of baout 15 u duration with a repitition frequency of 50 250 MHz. Due to the pulse nature of the beam the detector array is of integrating type, that is rather than counting each photon requiring a very fast responding detector it integrates the number of photons which are detected over a time period. The detector array comprises a linear array of a number ofBitmuthgermante crystals arranged in a side by side relationship and each optically coupled to a photodiod which delivers an electrical signal proportional to the said intergral, which in turn therefor is proportional to the transmission of the radiated body tissue.In Figure 3A there is shown the detector array 6 and its separate detectors xi. In the shown embodiment the physical length of the detector is about 60 cm comprising 128 detectors each made of a crystal Bismuthgermanete allowing for a picture resolution about 5 mm which a beam which is about 2 cm in square. When the beam is at crystal xn at time tn the photon transmission has a value of Tn In Figure 3B the beam has moved to xn 1 at time tn l and the transmission is Tun 1 The transmission values are arranged within a grey scale comprise 16 grey levels 0 corresponding to white and 16 to black. From the above it is clear that the linear array 6 is used as a coordinate system for the beam. For each position xi there is a transmission value Ti which is allocated xi.The position and transmission data for each scan of the beam over the array is recorded in a micro computer which preferably is of the 16 bit type allowing convenient format for storing said data. This format is shown in Figure 5 from which it appears that high oder byte stores the position of the beam while the low order byte stores the corresponding transmission values. After each scan of the beam over the array the gantry is rotated together with the array thrugh a predetermined angel around the patient s couch which is at rest and a new scan is made and new position and transmission data values are recorded. This is repeated for each angular setting of the gantry until finally a completed 3600 rotation of the gantry has been made.The data so collected and recorded is processed in a manner known per se in a frame computer shown at 12 inFigure 6 in order to reconstruct a CT image of the slice of the patient s body just irradiated. Thereafter either the patient s couch or the beam or both are moved a predetermied distance in the longitudinal direction of the couch and a newCT image of the body is taken while rotating the gantry around the patient s body.Instead of assigning a transmission value Ti to each of the positions xi by taking a separate reading at each detector which for example is done by using a multiplexer the output of which is connected to a scan and detector comupter 13 shown inFigure 6 connected to a common output conductor via an A D converter 14, the outputs of each of the detectors in the array one connected to a common conductor connected to said scan and detector computer 13 said common conductor in this case carrying a composite signal of thekind indicated inFigure 4.For reference and for monitoring the incident photon beam a second photon detector 15 is inserted between the target 9 and the transmission ion chamber 10. Should the photon fluence vary during the scanning, the transmission values are correspondingly modified.In accordance with the present invention the energy of the photons should be in the order of 50 Mev in order to produce pair production which gives a significant improvement in the contrast of the CT image.From the quotient of the incident photon fluence to the recorded transmission value the attenuation cofficient is determined for each position xi of the beam. This is made in a separate dose planning computer 16. The tumor is identified either by inspection of the CT images taken by the apparatus in accordance with the present invention or by inspection ofCT images taken by a conventioneal 70 140 kV CT scanner. In both cases the dose is then planned with the aid of the dose planning computer 16.If the dose is planned with the aid of a conventional CTscanner image then the latter image is copied within the frame computer on the photon CT image taken with the apparatus in accordance with the present invention. The resultant image will thus contain for each pixel picture element of the image 1 The position of e ach pixel and therefore the position of the corresponding part of the patient s organ tissue expressed in the coordinate system of the CT scanner in accordance with the present invention and 2 the absorbtion coefficient of the corresponding part of the patient s organ tissue, that is how much of the irradiation beam that is absorbed in different parts of the patent s body.This will improve the dose planning since no extrapolation of the kind referred to above is needed. Moreover, no positioning errors will encounter. The dose planning is a matter of minutes and during this time the patient remains resting at the couch.The radiation may also very easily perform dynamic radiation treatment of the target volume. In Figure 7 the target volume, for example a part of the throat of a patient, is shown at 17.The target volume should be treated with a constant dose rate.The overlying tissue, shown at 18, has varing thickness shown at D1 och D2 respectively .The incident radiation, shown at the vertical arrows, will therefore be absorbed in different rates in the tissue 13 leading to an uneven dose rate in the target volume 17. The broken line 19 indicates the position of the dose maximum should the target 17 be radiated with a constant dose. As appears the maximum dose is situated beneath the target volume 17 when the position D2 is radiated from above. This is unwanted, since you want the dose maximum to lye at the same lavel as in portion D1. To compensate for this a smaller dose should be given in the thinner dissue D2 than in the thicker Dl. By varying the speed of the scanning beam so that it is residing a longer time in the thicker tissue the dose rate in the target volume 17 is made constant over the target volume. For how long the beam should reside for example in the tissue is determined from the compuded absorbation coefficient for the coresponding portion of the thicker tissue and is made under program control from the dose planning computer.
