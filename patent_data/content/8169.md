# Hydrocarbon processing.

## Abstract
Pyrolysis of a hydrocarbon feedstock, for example naphtha, is carried out by subjecting the feedstock to ele vated temperature during passage through a reaction cham ber, which is for example one or more tubes arranged hori zontally or vertically such as a cracking coil. The reaction chamber is disposed within a fluidised bed of hot inert particles which are heated by firing a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel. A heavy fuel oil, for example pyrolysis fuel oil, is the preferred fuel.
