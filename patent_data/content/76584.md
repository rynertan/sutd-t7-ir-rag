# Epoxy compounds.

## Abstract
An epoxy compound includes one or two aromatic rings, one N diglycidyl group per aromatic ring and one or two halogen or halogen containing groups per aromatic ring, the epoxy compound having the general formula When the epoxy compound contains only one aromatic ring the group A may be a polyfluoroalkyl group in which case one or two such groups may be attached to the aromatic ring or a polyfluoroalkoxy group, in which case only one such group is attached to the aromatic ring. When the epoxy compound contains two aromatic rings, the group A may be Cl, Br, or a polyfluoroalkyl group and one or two such groups may be attached to each aromatic ring. The epoxy compounds may be cured to form high molecular weight polymers with improved resistance to moisture.
