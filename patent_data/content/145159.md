# Consumable electrodes for arc melting of zirconium or titanium alloys.

## Abstract
Electrode for consumable arc melting of zirconium and titanium alloys and containing a low melting point alloy constituent. The electrode uses a low resistance spar extend ing substantially the length of the electrode and being substantially free of any unalloyed low melting point alloy constituent. The external member containing unalloyed low melting pont constituent is attached to the spar member in a manner to provide a relatively high resistance through the external member in an axial direction of the electrode. During operation, this minimizes resistance heating of the external member away from the arc and thus premature melting of unalloyed low melting point constituent is generally avoided.
