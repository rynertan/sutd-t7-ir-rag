# Apparatus and process for extruding dough as used in producing crisp breads.

## Abstract
A dough guide is used to preciselv control thickness of an expanding dough extrudate. The extrudate is forced through at least two vertical slots 36,37 in an extrusion head, 35 at relatively high pressure and at a temperature at least equal to the boiling temperature of water. The dough guide has three plates 1,2,5 . A middle plate 5 is fixed between the slots 36,37 . Two movable plates 1,2 are disposed on opposte sides of each slot 36,37 from the middle plate 5 . A threaded rod 7,8 is used to selectively adjust the location of each of the movable plates 1,2 . In alternative embodiments, any number of slots are used, each having two guides adjacent it. Any or all of the guides may be made selectively movable. A product called crisp bread may be made thereby
