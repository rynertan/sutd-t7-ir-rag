## Description
TITLE TETRAETHYLENEGLYCOL DI N HEPTANOATE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyvinyl butyral is widely used in combination with one or more layers of glass to provide a composite which is resistant to shattering. The polyvinyl butyral typically contains a plasticizer to provide a balance of mechanical properties satisfactory for subsequent handling and performance requirements. It has been found that while certain plasticizers perform satisfactorily in combination with polyvinyl butyral, high concentrations of the plasticizer are generally necessary for satisfactory handling characteristics.In addition, many known plasticizers are incompatible wit polyvinyl butyral outside of limited ranges of hydroxyl content. SUB WARY OF THE INVENTION The instant invention provides a new composition which is particuiarly useful as a plasticizer for polyvinyl butyral over a wide range of hydroxyl content in the polyvinyl butyral. Specifically, the present invention provides a new composition, tetraethyleneglycol di n heptanoate of. the formulaEMI1.1 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE The figure is a graphical representation of the compatability of the compositions of the present invention with polyvinyl butyral as compared with known plasticizers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery of a new composition, tetraethyleneglycol di n heptanoate, and its particular suitability as a plasticizer for polyvinyl butyral. The composition has the following formula EMI2.1 This composition can be prepared by bringing into contact tetraethyleneglycol and heptanoic acid.These compounds are believed to react according to te equation EMI2.2 H3 CH2 5C O CH2CH2O 4C CH2 5CH3 2H2OWhile the desired product will generally be obtained in all proportions of the reactants, for maximum purity of the desired tetraethyleneglycol di n heptanoate at least two moles of heptanoic acid should be present for each mole of tetraethyleneglycol. Higher concentrations of the heptanoic acid, for example, up to about 2.5 moles of heptanoic acid for each mole of tetraethyleneglycol, are preferred when no additional catalyst or solvent is used in the reaction. The reaction of heptanoic acid and tetraethyleneglycol can be carried out without a catalyst. However, the rate and ease of reaction are facilitated by the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst can, and the most basic situation, be a minor excess of the heptanoic acid itself. Other catalysts which can be used include a variety of acids, including sulfuric, formic, polyphosphoric, or p toluenesulfonic acid and combinations of such acids. The catalyst, when used, is generally present in an amount to equal to about from 0.01 to 5.0 weight per cent of the total reactants. A solvent in addition to the reactants can be used in the preparation of the tetraethyleneglycol di n heptanoate if desired. The solvent should be inert to the reactants and should preferably form an azeotrope with the water that is formed in the course of the reaction. Particularly satisfactory and convenient are organic solvents such as toluene, xylene, and benzene. The preparation of the compound of the present invention can be carried out at ambient temperatures and pressures. However, to facilitate the reaction and for ease of removal of the water formed in the reaction, the synthesis is preferably carried out at elevated temperatures of about from 50 to 000. Particularly satisfactory is a temperature equivalent to the boiling point of an azeotrope of water with either the heptanoic acid or solvent used in the reaction. The water formed by the reaction of the two components is preferably removed during the course of the reaction to both increase the rate of reaction, drive the reaction to completion and to monitor its progress by measurement of the quantity of water generated. The water is conveniently removed by distillation of the azeotrope of water and acid or solvent. After completion of the reaction, the tetraethyleneglycol di n heptanoate can be recovered as a viscous colorless oil. If desired, residual solvent, water, catalyst or other impurities can be removed by conventional purification techniques, including filtration through anhydrous magnesium sulfate or charcoal or by vacuum distillation. The product as prepared frequently contains minor quantities, for example, up to 10 weight percent of various unreacted glycols such as ethylene, diethylene, triethylene and tetraethylene glycols unreacted heptanoic and alpha metylhexanoic acids as well as the mono and di esters thereof. The tetraethyleneglycol di n heptanoate 4G7 can be incorporated into polyvinyl butyral as a plasticizer using techniques that are usually used for other plasticizers. The polyvinyl butyral and plasticizer are present in quantities which result in a compatible admixture. The qussntities of plasticizer which can be added to any polyvinyl butyral vary according to the residual hydoxyl content of the polyvinyl butyral as illustrated in the Figure. Thus in polyvinyl butyral having a residual hydroxyl content of 20 percent, as much as 49 parts by weight of 4G7 plasticizer can be added per each hundred parts of polyvinyl butyral.However, for polyvinyl butyral resins having 25 weight percent residual hydroxyl content, a maximum of only about 32 parts of 4G7 plasticizer can be added per hundred parts of polyvinyl butyral resin.At or below these maximum quantities or at intermediate points along the line indicating maximum compatible plasticizer level, the quantity of plasticizer can be adjusted to achieve the desired level of polymer sheet characteristics. The plasticized polyvinyl butyral sheeting can be laminated to one or more layers of glass according to the procedures generally used in the art and illustrated, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,293,656, 3,838,091 and 4,107,366. The composition of the instant invention provides outstanding plasticization of polyvinyl butyral. It has been found that the composition is compatible with polyvinyl butyral over a wide range oE hydroxyl contents, and provides sheeting with excellent dimensional stability, tensile strength and stiffness at plasticizer concentrations which are lower then those required, for example using triethyleneglycol di 2 ethylbutyrate 3GH . In addition, if desired, te present compositions can be used in conjunction.with triethyleneglycol di 2 .ethyl butyrate. Although any proportion of the two plasticizers can be used, the beneficial effects of the instant compositions are most apparent in such mixtures when the tetraethyieneglycol di n heptanoate represents at least 10 weight percent of the blend of the two plasticizers. The present invention is further illustrated in the following specific examples, in which parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In these examples, the following procedures and tests were used. Refractive Index of Plasticizer ASTM D1045 with tests run at 25 0C instead of 23 0C. PVA Viscosity ASTM D1343 with a HoepplerBall Drop Viscometer used and a temperature of 20 0C instead of 250C. PVB Residual Hydroxyl Weight Percent asPVA ASTN D1396.

Flow Rate ASItI D1238 using conditions P for some reported values and a temperature of 150 C with the standard orifice and 5000g weight for other values as noted. Pummel Adhesion SAE J1208 Penetration Resistance ANSI Z26.1 using a staircase method to determine mean break height instead of throne level test of Z26.1 as described in U. S. Patent 3,718,516. Edge Stability ANSI Z26.1 with samples tested for four weeks instead of two. Compatibility Test samples are prepare by first blending 50g of dry polyvinyl butyral flake with a plasticizer. in a 0.47 1 bottle on a roll mill for 2 hours. The blend is then compounded in a sigma blade Brabender mixer for 10 minutes at 135 C. The resulting melt blend is pressed into 30 mil 0.76 mm films using a hydraulic press with the following cycle 1 preheat 6 minutes, 1800C, 5 psiy 34.5kPa, gage , 2 mold 1.5 minutes, 1800C and 100 psig, and 3 cool 4 minutes, 20OC anu 100 psig 689kPa, gage . A 2 x 3 inch 5.1 X 7.6 cm film is exposed for 72 hours at 100 relative humidity and 0 0C. The films are blotted between absorbent paper.The paper is then visually examined for evidence of a stain caused by exudation of the plasticizer. A compatible blend exhibits no stain. Accelerated Edge Cloud Edge Stability Test laminates are prepared by placing 30 mil film between two pieces of 12 x 12 x 0.1 inch 30.5 x 30.5 x 0.25 cm glass. An integral laminate is then prepared by using the following heat and pressure cycle 1 1 minute at 2000 then press between nip rolls, 2 3 minutes at 2000C then press again between nip rolls, and 3 9 minutes at 135or and 225 psig 1.55MPa, gage in an oil autoclave. The laminate is immersed in commercial, ammoniacal alcohol glass cleaning solution at 60 0C for 30 days.The laminate is then removed from the solution and the resulting edge cloud is measured bmmediately. After standing at ambient conditions for an additional 30 days, the laminate is reexamined for edge delaminations. Tensile Creep Elongation Test sheeting samples nominally 0.03 inch 0.76 mm thick are conditioned for 4 hours at 68 20F 20.0 1.1 C . The samples are then die cut to 0.75 x 4 inches 1.9 x 10.2 cm , marked and clipped into the test oven at 65 C for 1 hour. A 10 psi 69 kPa load is applied to each specimen and the elongation measured at 30 minutes. The results are calculated by dividing the gage length after testing by the initial gage length and multiplying by 100. Plasticizer Content by Vacuum Distillation Molded or extruded sheeting samples are dried in an oven at 600C for 30 60 minutes and weighed into a test tube. An accurately tared receiver is then attached. The tube is placed in a 285 20C heating block and vacuum 13 Pa minimum is applied. After 45 minutes, tne receiver containing evolved plasticizer is disconnected and weighed. The parts of plasticizer per hundred parts resin is calculated by multiplying the weight of collected plasticizer by 100 ano dividing by the difference between the original sample weight minus the weight plasticizer. EXAMPLE 1 Into a 1000ml three necked flask fitted with a Dean Stark trap, condenser and thermometer was added 286.3g 2.2 moles of heptanoic acid, 185.3g 1.0 mole of tetraethyleneglycol and 100 ml of toluene. To this solution was added 0.2 ml of formic acid and 1.0 ml of sulfuric acid as catalyst. The mixture was heated to reflux and water removed as the toluene water azeotrope. The reaction was continuea until the stoichiometric amount of water was removed. Remaining acid was neutralized by adding sodium bicarbonate. The mixture was then filtered through anhydrous magnesium sulfate and distilled under vacuum, b.p. 199 C 6.6 Pa .
