# CATHODE DRIVEN CROSSED FIELD AMPLIFIER

## Abstract
In a crossed field amplifier tube, an input section of slow wave circuit 24 is part of the cathode electrode 10 . An output section of slow wave circuit 52 is part of the anode electrode 16 . The anode circuit is axially displaced from the cathode circuit in the direction of drift of the electron stream so that a non propagating section 64 of the anode faces at least a part of the propagating cathode circuit.
