# Oriented multilayer heat sealable packaging film and method of forming same.

## Abstract
An oriented multilayer heat sealable film structure comprising a polyolefin film substrate, a layer of a random copolymer of ethylene and propylene, a primer layer on said copolymer layer and a layer of heat sealable vinylidene chloride polymer on said primer layer. The method of pre paring said structure includes aging said structure at a temperature and for a time resulting in increased heat seal strength.
