# Fuel injection timing control system.

## Abstract
A fuel injection timing control system of an internal combustion engine of a compression ignition type including a fuel injection pump 17 driven by a cam 14 connected to the engine, and a valve 31 operative to return a part of the fuel delivered by the fuel injection pump 17 to the fuel source 33 . The advance angle of the cam 14 is set beforehand at a value bigger than those assumed in the range for normal operation, and the real fuel injection timing is modified by actuating the valve 31 according to operating conditions of the engine.
