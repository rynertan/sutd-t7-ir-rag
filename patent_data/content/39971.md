# Process for the preparation of a polymerization catalyst and preparation of ethylene polymer therewith.

## Abstract
An improved supported chromium containing catalyst is prepared by reacting 1 a chromium chelate of a 1,3 diketo compound and 2 a vanadium chelate or a vanadyl chelate of a 1,3 diketo compound, separately or jointly with 3 an organometallic compound of a metal from Group II or III of the periodic system, jointly contacting the resulting reaction pro ducts of 1 and 2 with 3 with an inert inorganic supporting material so as to deposit such reaction products thereon, whereafter the supporting material containing the reaction products is heated in a non reducing atmosphere at a temper ature of between 200 and 1200 C. The 1,3 diketo compounds of 1 and 2 are the same or different, and have the formula
