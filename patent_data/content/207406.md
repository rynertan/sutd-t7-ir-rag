## Description
The present invention relates to a reagent sheet for use in the measurement of γ glutamyl transferase activity in a liquid sample, particularly for use in the analysis of aqueous sample solutions, particularly in the analysis of γ glutamyl transferase activity in body fluids in clinical test. It is very important to measure the activity of γ glutamyl transferase in human body fluids in clinical test. As enzyme activity relating to a cancer of the liver, bile duct or the pancreas, there is frequently done the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase hereinafter referred to sometimes as GGT in body fluids in the diagnosis of said cancer. As the method of measurement of GGT activity, there had been reported a GGT activity measuring method using a synthetic substrate by A. Szewczuk M. Orlowski in 1960 see, Clin. Chem. Acta, 5 680 688, 1980 . Since then, various synthetic compounds for the measurement of GGT activity had been synthesized, systems of conjugation reactions with color forming reactions had been developed, and various methods are widely used at the present time see, Japanese Patent Provisional Publication Nos. 54 1979 133191, 53 1978 111793, 54 1979 132533, 56 1981 148298, 56 1981 148299, 56 1981 164796, 56 1981 23897, 56 1981 92845, 56 1981 158745, 56 1981 169597, 56 1981 30956, 53 1978 147034, 54 1979 28195 and 55 1980 26870 . Most of the aforementioned methods use consecutive reactions in which pH of the reaction system is changed to form a color or there is added a color reagent which has a fear of said reagent itself or an intermediate inhibiting an enzyme reaction. Though there are only a few cases at present, there are synthesized some substrates which allows the enzyme reaction itself to be directly observed, that is, some self developable substrates having velocity method applicability. As the self developable substrates for the measurement of GGT activity, there are known γ glutamyl p nitroanilide developed by M. Orlowski see, Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp., The latter is superior in solubility and used as a substrate for IFCC standard method. Although the former is poor in solubility, it has been early developed and its manufacturing cost is low, so that the substrate has been most studied, its clinical knowledge is rich, and it is widely used presently. In an analytical method using γ glutamyl p nitroanilide as self developable substrate, there is used a surfactant for dissolving said γ glutamyl p nitroanilide which is difficultly soluble. However, it is known that the use of a cationic or anionic surfactant alone inhibits GGT activity. Thus, in conventional analytical methods, there is a serious problem how to dissolve γ glutamyl p nitroanilide without inhibiting GGT activity. As a method for dissolving γ glutamyl p nitroanilide without inhibiting GGT activity, there is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 57 1982 24759 a method in which γ glutamyl p nitroanilide is dissolved in an aqueous solution containing both a cationic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant. Further, Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 55 1980 153600 discloses a freeze dried agent which can be almost instantaneously dissolved in a bufferred test solution at 20 to 25 An analytical method which can be performed with only a small amount of a sample and can be easily operated with high accuracy, has been highly desired by medical persons such as medical doctors in clinical test. Therefore, GGT activity measuring methods using a dry analytical method in place of said conventional wet analytical method have been developed in recent years. In the dry analytical methods, reagents required for detection reaction are preserved in a dry state and the reaction of these reagents with a small quantity of a sample solution is detected to make the measurement. Among the dry analytical methods, there have been developed analytical methods using an integral multilayer analytical element which is easy to handle and the improvements of the element are being made. The integral multilayer analytical element for the measurement of GGT activity comprises a porous spreading layer containing a substrate which is self developable in response to contact with γ glutamyl p nitroanilide, a support layer and optionally other intervening functional layers such as a water absorbing layer prepared by laminating them for integration. The dry analytical methods using such an integral multilayer analytical element was reported by H.G. Curme, et al. Clim. Chem., However, when the activity of γ glutamyl transferase is measured by these dry analytical methods, there are caused other problems in addition to those associated with the conventional wet analytical methods in which γ glutamyl p nitroanilide is poor in solubility and the surfactants inhibits GGT activity. Unlike the wet analytical method, the substrate and other reagents are preserved in dry state in the dry analytical method. Therefore, when the substrate preserved in a dry state is brought into contact with a small amount of water in a liquid sample, the substrate must be readily re dissolved in order to improve the accuracy of the measurement of GGT activity and to make the measurement over a wide range. In US A 4 050 898, the incorporation of a surfactant into a dry type analytical element is described. In WO A 8 400 978, the analysis of GGT in a wet system utilizing a solution of gamma glutamyl p nitroanilide is disclosed. However, no mention is given with respect to a dry type analytical element. EP A 0 022 240 describes an analytical element designed specifically for bilirubin analysis utilizing diazonium salts. EP A 0 159 638 describes a multizone analytical element for the determination of an analyt in an aqueous liquid comprising a registration zone and a porous spreading zone to receive in transport the aqueous liquid. The spreading zone contains a non polymeric quarternary ammonium compound. The present inventors have made studies in the measurement of γ glutamyl transferase activity by the dry analytical method and have now surprisingly found that the cationic surfactant hardly inhibits GGT activity in the dry analytical method, even when the surfactant is used at a concentration at which the surfactant inhibits GGT activity in the conventional wet analytical method. It is an object of the present invention to provide a reagent sheet for the measurement of GGT activity which is free from the problems associated with the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase in the conventional dry analytical method. It is another object of the present invention to provide a reagent sheet for the measurement of GGT activity, which is easy to handle, can be readily operated and makes it possible to easily make the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase in a liquid sample even by unskilled persons such as medical doctors and nurses in clinical test. Accordingly, the present invention provides a reagent sheet for the measurement of activity of gamma glutamyl transferase comprising a porous sheet containing gamma glutamyl p nitroanilide or comprising a porous spreading layer containing gamma glutamyl p nitroanilide, a water absorbing layer and a support layer, characterized in that the porous sheet or porous spreading layer further contains a cationic surfactant of quarternary ammonium salt in an amount ranging from 0.2 g m² to 5 g m² and a hydrophilic polymer. In the reagent sheet for the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase according to the present invention, the porous reagent sheet or the porous spreading layer hereinafter referred to as spreading layer contains γ glutamyl p nitroanilide as a self developable substrate as well as a cationic surfactant of quarternary ammonium salt in an amount in the range of 0.2 to 5g. m². The cationic surfactant of quarternary ammonium salt has an effect of stably dispersing the self developable substrate in the reagent sheet or the spreading layer and uniformly containing it in an amorphous state with a high dissolving rate. Further, the cationic surfactant has an effect of improving the spreadability of a sample on the reagent sheet or the spreading layer. The range of 0.2 to 5 g. m² for the cationic surfactant content of the reagent sheet or the spreading layer is a range within which the cationic surfactant functions effectively and does substantially not inhibit GGT activity. When in the conventional wet analytical method the cationic surfactant is used in such an amount that it functions effectively, it inhibits GGT activity to such an extent that the accuracy of the measurement is seriously affected, while in the dry analytical method using the reagent sheet of the invention, said cationic surfactant functions effectively and substantially does not inhibit GGT activity without requiring any other particular means. The above unique structure of the reagent sheet or the spreading layer makes it possible that the reagent sheet for the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase according to the invention are allowed to conduct measurement over a wide range and can be easily operated with high accuracy. Figure 1 is a graph showing the correlation between the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide used in the Comparison Example and the value of the relative activity of GGT measured in the solution method. The values of the relative activity shown in Figure 1 are calculated by taking as 100 the value of the relative activity where the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is 0.25 g. The porous reagent sheet for the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase according to the invention has preferably a metering effect i.e., metering the spotted liquid sample . The term reagent sheet and spreading layer capable of metering a liquid sample herein used refers to a layer having a function capable of spreading an applied liquid in such a manner that the spread area of the liquid is approximately in proportion to the amount of the liquid when the liquid is applied thereon. When the layer is spreading layer, it also has a function capable of supplying an uniform quantity of the liquid per area to a water absorbing layer described hereinafter. Further, the reagent sheet and the spreading layer of the present invention preferably have spaces which allow γ glutamyl transferase as an analyte to pass therethrough. Therefore, it is preferred to use filter paper, woven fabric, nonwoven fabric, knitted fabric, glass fiber filter, membrane filter or a three dimensional lattice structure composed of a polymer microbead as a material constituting a matrix of the reagent sheet or the spreading layer of the analytical element of the present invention.

Woven fabric or knitted fabric is preferably a fabric from which fat is substantially removed when the yarn or the fabric is prepared. The fabrics are more preferably processed to be hydrophilic to enhance the adhesion to an underlying layer, when the fabric is used as the spreading layer.

The nonionic surfactant having the HLB value may be selected from ethylene oxide adducts i.e., condensation products of polyhydric alcohol ester, polyethylene glycol monoester, polyethylene glycol diester, ethylene oxide adducts condensation products of higher alcohol, ethylene oxide adducts condensation products of alkylphenol, and alkanol amides of higher fatty acid. A combination of two or more surfactants may be used as the nonionic surfactant. HLB value of the surfactant can be adjusted by using said combination of the surfactants including surfactants having HLB value of less than 10 .

Said hydrophilic polymer has an effect of preserving small amount of water in the spotted sample to accelerate the catalytic reaction of analyte enzyme. The enzyme activators which can be incorporated in the reagent sheet or the spreading layer according to the present invention are those serving as an acceptor for γ glutamyl groups to be transferred from the substrate by the action of γ glutamyl transferase. Examples of such γ glutamyl group acceptors include various amino acids and oligopeptides. However, when a sufficient amount of such component serving as an acceptor is contained in a sample solution, it is not necessary to incorporate such an acceptor in the reagent sheet or the spreading layer. Such γ glutamyl group acceptors are described in literatures such as Clinical Chemistry, Vol. 24, No. 6 1978 905 915 by L.M. Shaw. Preferred examples of the γ glutamyl group acceptors include D methionine, L methionine, L glutamine, L leucine, L alanine, L lysine, L cysteine, glycylglycine and glycylglycylglycine, among which glycylglycine is particularly preferred.

Examples of light blocking particles include carbon black, gas black and carbon microbeads. Titanium dioxide fine particles and barium sulfate fine particles are preferred and anatase type titanium dioxide fine particle is most preferred. The self developable substrate, the cationic surfactant, the nonionic surfactant, the hydrophilic polymer, the reagents such as enzyme activator and the buffering agent and the fine light blocking particle can be incorporated in the reagent sheet or the spreading layer by spraying a coating solution containing said ingredients over the reagent sheet or the spreading layer and drying it. When the reagent sheet or the spraying layer is composed of woven fabric, knitted fabric, filter paper, non woven fabric or glass fiber filter paper, the reagent sheet or the spreading layer is immersed in a solution containing said ingredients and dried. When the spreading layer is composed of materials to be laminated, the materials are immersed in said solution and are laminated in a dry or semi dry state on each other for integration. When the spreading layer is to be formed by coating, for instance, the spreading layer is composed of a brush polymer layer or a three dimensional lattice microbead structure, a mixture of a coating solution for the spreading layer and a coating solution containing said ingredients may be coated. These ingredients can be incorporated in the reagent sheet or the spreading layer by using different methods for every ingredient, or by applying separately every ingredient. However, it is desirable that a solution containing both the self developable substrate γ glutamyl p nitroanilide and the cationic surfactant is prepared, so that the cationic surfactant sufficiently reacts with the substrate. The material of the support of the reagent sheet of the invention is preferably a light transmissive, liquid impermeable support. Examples of the liquid impermeable, light transmissive supports include substantially water impermeable transparent supports in the form of a film or sheet made of a polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate of bisphenol A, polystyrene and cellulose esters e.g., cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate etc. .

The reagent sheet for the measurement of the activity of γ glutamyl transferase according to the present invention can be laminated onto the support to integrate them. The support to be laminated onto the reagent sheet is preferably a support which does not transmit light or contains a light reflecting colorant. Such a light non transmitting support or a light reflecting colorant containing support can be easily prepared by incorporating a light reflecting colorant in said polymer, by coating the surface of a transparent support composed of said polymer with a light reflecting colorant, or by sticking a pressure sensitive adhesive tape containing a light reflecting colorant on a support. There may be provided an undercoating layer on the support to enhance the adhesion between the support and a water absorbing layer or the reagent sheet. Instead of providing the undercoating layer, the surface of the support may be activated by a physical or chemical process to enhance the adhesion. There is provided a water absorbing layer on the support optionally, intervened by other layers such as undercoating layer . The water absorbing layer is a layer comprising a hydrophilic binder which is preferably a hydrophilic polymer which absorbs water to swell. The hydrophilic polymer preferably shows swelling ratio ranging from 150 to 2,000 , more preferably from 250 to 1,500 . at 30 The dry thickness of the water absorbing layer is in the range of 1 to 100 µm, preferably 3 to 30 µm. Preferably, the water absorbing layer should be substantially transparent. If desired, a buffering agent may be incorporated in the water absorbing layer. Examples of such buffering agents include conventional buffering agents such as carbonates, borates, phosphates and good s buffering agents. These buffering agents can be chosen by referring to literatures such as Fundamental Experimental Method of Protein Enzyme by T. Horio et al. Nankodo, 1981 written in Japanese. There may be provided a light blocking layer on the water absorbing layer. The light blocking layer is a water permeable layer in which light blocking or light reflecting fine particles are dispersed in small amount of a film forming hydrophilic polymer binder. The light blocking layer may function as light reflecting layer or background layer as well as blocker to the color of an aqueous liquid spotted on the spreading layer, such as the red of hemoglobin in a whole blood sample, when a detectable change a color change or a color development etc. in the water absorbing layer is measured from the side of the transparent support reflection photometry. Examples of light blocking and light reflecting particle include fine titanium dioxide particles rutile type, anatase type or brookite type mean size ranging from 0.1 µm to 1.2 µm , fine barium sulfate particles, fine aluminum particles and their flakes. Examples of light blocking particle include carbon black, gas black and carbon microbeads. Fine titanium dioxide particles and fine barium sulfate particles are preferred, and anatase type titanium dioxide particles are most preferred. Examples of the film forming hydrophilic polymer binder include a weakly hydrophilic polymer such as regenerated cellulose and cellulose acetate as well as the hydrophilic polymer employable in the reaction layer. Most preferred are gelatin, gelatin derivatives and polyacrylamide. Gelatin and gelatin derivatives may be used as a mixture with a known hardening agent cross linking agent . The light blocking layer can be provided in such a manner that an aqueous dispersion containing the light blocking particle and the hydrophilic polymer is coated on the reaction layer and then dried by any of the conventional methods. Instead of the light blocking layer, the light blocking particles may be incorporated into the spreading layer. There may be provided an adhesive layer on the water absorbing layer or optionally added other layer e.g., light blocking layer to enhance the adhesion of the spreading layer. The adhesive layer is preferably constituted by a hydrophilic polymer which can bond the spreading layer to other layer to make all of the layers integrated while the polymer is wetted or swelled with water. Examples of the hydrophilic polymer include the polymers employable in the water absorbing layer. Most preferred are gelatin, gelatin derivatives and polyacrylamide. The dry thickness of the adhesive layer generally ranges from 0.5 µm to 20 µm, preferably from 1 µm to 10 µm. The adhesive layer may be provided on other layers as well as the water absorbing layer. The adhesive layer can be prepared in such a manner that a solution of a hydrophilic polymer and optionally added other agent such as a surfactant is coated on the water absorbing layer or other layer. The reagent sheet of the present invention may optionally contain other functional layers in addition to the above described essential layers. It is preferred from the viewpoint of manufacture, packaging, transportation, preservation and measuring operation that the reagent sheet of the present invention is cut into pieces of about 15 to 30 mm square or a circle of about 15 to 30 mm in diameter and put in a slide frame to provide an analytical slide as disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication Nos. 57 1982 63452 and 54 1979 156079, Japanese Utility Model Provisional Publication Nos. 56 1981 142454 and 58 1983 32350 and Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 58 1983 501144. 5 to 30 µℓ, preferably 8 to 15 µℓ of an aqueous liquid sample is deposited spotted on the reagent sheet or the porous spreading layer of the integral multilayer analytical element of the invention, and if necessary, the reagent sheet or the analytical element is incubated at a substantially constant temperature of 20 to 45 The following examples and comparison example are provided to illustrate the present invention without limiting it thereto. The surface of a transparent polyethylene terephthalate support of 180 µm in thickness was treated to make it hydrophilic. The hydrophilic surface of the support was coated with the coating solution having the following composition and dried to form a water absorbing layer of 15 µm in dry film thickness. The surface of said water absorbing layer was coated with the coating solution having the following composition and dried to form an adhesive layer of 3 µm in dry film thickness. The surface of said adhesive layer was wetted with a 0.4 aqueous solution of nonylphenoxy polyglycidol. A tricot fabric composed of a spun yarn of polyethylene terephthalate 36 gauge, 50 denier, about 230 µm thick was laminated onto said wetted surface under pressure to form a spreading layer. The following substrate coating solution was applied to the spreading layer in a coating amount of 120 mℓ m² and dried. A solution of 2.28 g. of γ glutamyl p nitroanilide dissolved in a solution of 1 mℓ of 2 N hydrochloric acid and 1 mℓ of ethanol was added to the following uniform solution, and pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 8.3 by the addition of 1.3 mℓ of 6 N hydrochloric acid to prepare the substrate coating solution. The surface of the spreading layer was coated with the following titanium dioxide coating solution in a coating amount of 112 mℓ m² and dried. In this way, a reagent sheet the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide content of the spreading layer about 1 g. m² for the measurement of GGT activity according to the present invention was prepared. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide used in the uniform solution was 0.250 g. in place of 0.50 g. to prepare an analytical element cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide content of the spreading layer about 0.5 g. m² for the measurement of GGT activity according to the present invention. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide used in the uniform solution was 1.0 g. in place of 0.50 g. to prepare an analytical element cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide content of the spreading layer about 2 g. m² for the measurement of GGT activity according to the present invention. Each of the reagent sheets obtained by Examples 1 to 3 was cut into a piece 15 mm square and put in a plastic mount disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 57 1982 63452 to prepare a slide for the analysis of GGT. GGT of bovine kidney, which had a GGT activity of 1900 U L from the measurement with RA 1000 a wet process analyzer manufactured by Technicon Co. Ltd., was dissolved in commercial available control serum, and the resulting solution was added to each of the above slides. The resulting control solution was used as a specimen. 10 µℓ of the control solution was applied dropped on each slide, the hole of the deposited side was closed by a pressure sensitive adhesive tape Mylar to prevent water from being evaporated, each slide was heated on a 37 It is apparent from the above results that there are no much fluctuations in GGT activity over a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide content range of 0.5 to 2 g. m². The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that polyacrylamide was omitted from the uniform solution and the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was 0.25 to 2.0 g. to prepare a uniform solution. In a similar manner to that described in Example 1, γ glutamyl p nitroanilide was added to each of the uniform solutions to prepare a substrate solution. 30 µℓ of each substrate solution was put in a cuvette, 10 µℓ of the same control serum as that of Example 3 was added thereto, the cuvette was kept at 37 Figure 1 is a graph showing the correlation between the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide used in the Comparison Example and the value of the relative activity of GGT measured in the solution method. The values of the relative activity shown in Figure 1 are calculated by taking as 100 the value of a relative activity where the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is 0.25 g. It is apparent from Figure 1 that when the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide content is 0.5 g., the ratio of inhibition in the activity of GGT is 30 when the content is 0.75 g., the ratio is 10 and when the content is 1.0 g. or higher, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide inhibits the activity to such an extent that the measurement is practically impossible. Therefore it is also apparent that even when cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is used in an amount which does almost not inhibit the activity in the dry analytical method of the present invention, such an amount is to cause a serious inhibition to the measurement in the solution method. The analytical element was cut into pieces of 15 mm square and each was put into a plastic mount disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 57 1982 63452 to prepare an analytical slide for the analysis of GGT. While heating said slide on a 37 The values of the color density were those calculated from a color density to p nitroaniline conversion formula which was prepared by using an aqueous p nitroaniline solution having a known concentration. The measured and calculated results are shown in Table 3. The values of Table 3 are calculated from the following formula The coefficient γ of correlation is 0.99425 from the results of Table 3. It is apparent from Table 3 that the slides having the analytical element of the invention produce p nitroaniline in well correlation to GGT activity and hence, the analytical element of the present invention is effective in measuring GGT activity. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that an equal amount of each of cationic surfactants given in Table 4 was used in place of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide used in the uniform solution to prepare an analytical element. Slides for the analysis of GGT were prepared therefrom, and it was found that any of the slides was effective in the measurement of GGT activity as in Example 4. A glass fiber filter of 200 µm in thickness was impregnated with the substrate coating solution of Example 1 in a coating amount of 100 mℓ m², and cut into a 1 cm² sheet which was then fixed to a flat plastic plate containing a white pigment incorporated therein to obtain a reagent sheet for the measurement of GGT activity. 10 µℓ of serum was deposited on said reagent sheet. After 10 minutes, the reflection density was measured with Macbeth reflection densitometer and there was detected an yellow color density in proportion to the GGT activity of the deposited solution. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the following titanium dioxide coating solution was used in place of that used in Example 1 to prepare a reagent sheet the spreading layer containing both cationic surfactant and nonionic surfactant for the measurement of GGT activity according to the present invention. The procedure of Example 7 was repeated except that 50 mℓ of 0.5 hydroxylmethyl cellulose was used in place of 50 mℓ of 0.5 hydroxylethyl cellulose used in the titanium dioxide coating solution and each of nonionic surfactants given in Table 5 was used in place of POE 50 nonyl phenyl ether used in the titanium dioxide coating solution to prepare a reagent sheet. Each of the analytical elements obtained by Examples 7 and 8 was cut into a piece 15 mm square and put in a plastic mount disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 57 1982 63452 to prepare a slide for the analysis of GGT. 10 µℓ of each of control solution having protein content of 4 and 12 and GGT activity of 580 U L was deposited dropped on each slide, and the color density thereof was measured after 2 and 5 minutes. The results are shown in Table 6. In Table 6, OD is the difference of values measured after 2 and 5 minutes. It is apparent from the above results that analytical elements using nonionic surfactant in addition to cationic surfactant have the improved spreadability of the spreading layer and that values measured by such elements are almost not interferred by protein content in sample solution.
