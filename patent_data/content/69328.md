# Electromagnetic fuel injection.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic fuel injector for internal combustion engines comprises a yoke 10 containing a coil 14 and cores 15, 29 a cylinder 21 secured to the yoke 10 and therein forming a nozzle 24 , a valve seat 23 , a valve guide bore 22 , and a plurality of fine fuel passages 64 formed between the valve seat 23 and the termination of the valve guide bore 22 a ball valve 26 connected to a plunger 27 with a flange 28 and inserted slidably in said valve guide bore 22 a holder 34 of a dense material mounted at one end on the cylinder 21 with a little gap therebetween and with an O ring 44 being pressed in the radial direction, and secured fluid tightly at the other end to the yoke 10 thereby to define an annular fuel reservoir 40 around the cylinder 21 . A pair of fuel pipes 7 is connected to the holder 34 . Further, a cap 50 is mounted in the front of the holder 34 to jet fuel from the nozzle 24 , whereby fuel is atomized.
