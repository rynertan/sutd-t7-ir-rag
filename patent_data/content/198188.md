# Flow regulator device for pipes made of elastically deformable material.

## Abstract
The flow regulator device 1 comprises an internally threaded plug 6 , a punch 7 , a blade 9 and a body 3 . The body 3 has a substantially parallelepipedal form defin ing a C like cross section and a tower portion 4 ter minating in an externally threaded cylindrical tract 5 , adapted for threadedly engaging the plug 6 . The punch 7 protrudes from the plug 6 and is adapted for acting on the blade 9 . The blade 9 projects internally from the body 3 and is adapted for exerting force on a pipe 2 wherein the flow rate is to be controlled.
