## Description
The present invention relates to dielectric materials and a method by which such dielectric materials are made. The present invention also relates to circuit boards made from said material and a method by which such circuit boards are produced. Generally speaking, a circuit board such as a microwave circuit board comprises two conductive foils having inserted therebetween a material having a predetermined dielectric constant. The microwave circuit boards are then processed to remove portions of the conductive foil to define a circuit pattern. The removal of parts of the foil is usually accomplished by etchants, solvents, or the like. One type of microwave circuit board was disclosed in a paper presented at IEEE NEMA 1975 Electrical Electronics Insulation Conference at Boston, Massachusetts onNovember 11, 1975, EPSILAM 10 A New High Dielectric Constant Conformable Copper Clad Laminate , M. Olyphant, Jr.,D.D. Demeny, and T.E. Nowicki. EPSILAM 10, a product of the 3 M Company, is believed to be a composite of poly tetrafluoroethylene PTFE and dielectric filler, the composite typically having a dielectric constant between 10 and 11 and being clad on both sides by copper foil. In general, prior art microwave circuit boards exhibit numerous disadvantageous properties. For example, prior art microwave circuit boards, and more particularly the dielectric material from which it is made, tend to absorb moisture to an undesirable degree. Thus, when the conductive foil of the microwave circuit boards is removed by etchants or solvents, the underlying dielectric material absorbs moisture in undesirable amounts. The absorption of moisture results in at lesst two serious problems the electrical properties of the circuit board are changed and the circuit board may physically expand, thus straining tolerances which must be observed in microwave circuit design. The prior art circuit boards, when processed to remove portions of the conductive foil to define circuits, tend to undergo strain relief to an undesirable degree.Strain relief is a measurement which quantifies the di mensional changes in the microwave circuit board after it is processed to remove a portion of the conductive foil. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, it is undesirable to have a circuit board which changes in shape substantially when processed to remove a portion of the copper foil. Moreover, prior art microwave circuit boards may tend to have a non uniform dielectric constant throughout any one microwave circuit board. It is believed that this non uniformity of dielectric constant is due, at least in part, to incomplete mixing of the dielectric filler with the PTFE. Thus, in certain portions of the circuit board, there may be an excess of PTFE and insufficient dielectric filler. Furthermore, prior art microwave circuit boards may tend to have a relatively high energy dissipation factor. Another type of microwave circuit board is that made by Rogers Corporation, Rogers, Connecticut, and marketed under the trademark RT Duroid. This product, which comprises PTFE and glass micro fibers, has the desired strain relief properties but does not have a sufficiently high dielectric constant for some applications. The present invention as claimed is intended to provide a dielectric material which is moisture resistant, which has a relatively high and uniform dielectric constant and which has a relatively low dissipation factor at high frequencies, as well as a circuit board made from said dielectric material.A related object of the invention is to provide a method of making said dielectric material and said circuit boards. The dielectric material according to the invention comprises a composite of a polmeric binder, a filler having a high dielectric constant and a microfibrous material.The dielectric material is produced by mixing a dispersion of polymer particles with particular filler material and microfibrous material to form a slurry of polymer particles, filler particles and fiber, agglomerating the polymer particles, the filler particles and the fibers to provide a mass, and shaping said mass to form a dielectric material. e circuit board of the present invention comprises a sheet of dielectric material having a layer of conductive foil adhered to either side of the sheet. In the method of making the microwave circuit boards, the dielectric material is foried and the conductive foil is subsequently adhered to both sides of the dielectric material. in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymer dispersion comprises an anionic dispersion of poly tetrafluoroethylene , the particulate filler comprises titania and the microfibrous material comprises glass micro fibers. The circuit board of the present invention provides for reduced strain relief when the copper foil is removed by etchant or solvent. The microwave circuit board is also particularly moisture resistant. In the microwave circuit board moisture resistance is a particularly important property because the electrical properties of the material will change if the circuit board absorbs moisture. Moreover, the microwave circuit board of the present invention has a relatively high dielectric constant which is uniform throughout the entire circuit board. The microwave circuit board also has a relatively low energy dissipation factor. The microwave circuit board of the present invention comprises a sheet of dielectric material having conductive foil clad to one and usually both sides of the sheet.In the method of making the circuit boards, the dielectric material is produced and, subsequently, the conductive foil, a copper foil by way of example, is adhered to opposite sides of the sheet. In the process of making the dielectric material, a dispersion of polymer particles is selected, the polyme being dispersed by ionic or non ionic surfactants. It is desirable that the polymer have a melting point higher than about 300 0C so that a circuit board made from the polymer is capable of withstanding high environmental and. processing temperatures. The polymer may be selected from the following classes Halogenated hydrocarbons such as poly tetrafluoroethylene PTFE and fluorinated poly etheneco propene , polyolefins, polyacrylates, and substituted vinyl polymers such as polystyrene and poly vinylidene flucridej The polymer dispersion is preferably an aqueous dispersion which is diluted to between about 10 and about 35 weight percent solids, most preferably about twenty weight percent solids. A dielectric filler is added to the polymer dispersion and mixed so as to uniformly distribute the filler in the dispersion. The filler can comprise from about ten weight percent to about sixty five weight percent of the dielectric material. For a dielectric constant of 10.5 using nonpigmentary titania filler, the filler should comprise between about 60 and 65 weight percent of the dielectric material. The filler and the amount of the filler in the dielectric material is selected depending upon the desired electrical properties of the dielectric material.Although it should be understood that the dielectric filler can be selected from any of a number of known dielectric materials, exemplary materials include titania, alumina, zirconia, ground quartz, amorphous or crystalline silica, and ferrite ceramics in powder form. The upper limitation on the weight percent of the filler in the dielectric material is the amount at which the circuit board would exhibit undesirable porosity or impaired strength. The filler material should be used in particle form and the average particle size should be below about 50 micrometers, and, most preferably, between about 1 and 20 micrometers. The preferred filler material is titania. It should also be understood that a mixture of different filler materials may be used. For example, it may be desirable to use a titania filler and modify the magnetic permeability of the resulting circuit board by including ferrite fillers. The filler added may be a mixture of filler and liquid, thereby simplifying handling of the filler and providing intimate mixture of the filler with the polymer dispersion. Microfibers are then added to the polymer and filler slurry and are mixed in the slurry to provide a slurry of polymer, filler, and microfibers. Although it is preferred that the fiber comprise microfibrous glass, the fiber could be made from other compositions, such as fibrous aluminum silicate, fibrous microcrystalline materials such as a potassium titanate whisker material. Examples of other non conductive microfibers include quartz fiber and zirconia fibers. It is preferred that the fibers have an average diameter below about 2 micrometers and preferably have an average diameter of between about 0.1 and 1.0 micrometers.It is preferred that the fibers have, on the average, a relatively short length, preferably below about 3 millimeters. Since many of the fibers provided from conventional sources exceed these desired lengths, the fibers may be broken by any conventional mechanical means, such as grinding the fibers, or pressing the fibers to crush the fibers.The amount of microfibrous material included in the dielectric material should be sufficient to provide desired strain relief and rigidity. In general, it is preferred that the microfibers be added in an amount less than about 10 weight percent of the dielectric material. A particularly preferred source of fiber is a fiber sold by JohnsManville, under the designation 104E, a fiber believed to comprise a low sodium and potassium content borosilicate glass. The fibers may be added in dry form or may be added in a liquid fiber slurry to facilitate handling. It should be understood that the polymer, the filler material, and the fibers may be mixed in any order.However, it is desirable to mix the afore mentioned materials in such a manner to provide uniform distribution of the materials. This is believec to be desirable in order to provide a dielectric material having a relatively uniform dielectric constant, uniforn strain relief and uniform moisture resistance. Although it is envisioned that other liquids may be used in the slurry, it is particularly preferred that the afore mentioned slurry have an aqueous base. Once the slurry is mixed in any conventional manner to a point wherein the fibers, the particles of filler material, and the polymer are intimately and uniformly mixed, the materials in the slurry are agglomerated to provide a dough like mass. In order to agglomerate the mixture of polymer, filler and fibers, a flocculant is added to the mixture.It should be understood that the chemical composition of the flocculant used is dependant upon the polymer chosen and the manner by which the polymer is dispersed The preferred flocculating agent for formulations based on PTFE is poly ethyleneimine , PEl , a commercialy available water soluble polymer having the repeating unitEMI6.1 and available as an aqueous solution. It is understood that aqueous solutions combine with H20 to form a polycationic material with the repeating unitEMI6.2 A large number of other polycationic flocculating agents could also be used. It is believed that these materials flocculate the mixture by attaching to anionic groups on the surfaces of the polymer particles, the fibers, and the fillers.Another type of flocculant that would be effective with ionically stabilized polymer dispersions is the use of hydrolyzable inorganic compounds that form aqueous solutions of polyvalent ions. These function by reducing the ionic double layer repulsion between polymer particles. The liquid is then removed from the agglomerated mass by any given conventional means. A preferred method of removing the liquid from the agglomerated material is to transfer the agglomerated material to a nylon fabric filter bag and allow gravity drainage of the material. By this method there is produced a wet crumbly dough having about 60 weight percent solids. The batch may be then spread thinly in shallow trays and allowed to dry in an oven at a temperature of 100 to 200 C for 16 to 24 hours or at any temperature and time sufficient to remove the liquid from the agglomerated material. The agglomerate or dough comprising the polymer, filler, and microfibers can be directly formed into a desired shape. In the case of an aqueous slurry, it should be understood that the forming of the agglomerate into sheets or other desired shapes is difficult because the agglomerate tends to be sticky and clog extrusion dys or stick to calendering apparatus. In cases where it is difficult to form the desired shapes from the aqueous agglomerate, it is preferred that the agglomerate be dried, and then mixed with a suitable lubricant, the lubricant allowing for forming of the agglomerate by any conventional means such as calendering or paste extrusion. The lubricant can be selected from various conventional lubricants. It is particularly preferred that the lubricant be non toxic as a liquid or a vapor and have a relatively low volatility so that at forming temperatures, the liquid lubricant will not vaporize. However, it should be understood that for particular forming methods, it may be necessary to use a toxic lubricant which may also have a relatively high volatility. The particularly preferred lubricant is dipropylene glycol DPG manufactured by UnionCarbide Corporation. Other types of lubricants includeStoddard solvent, a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons commercially available as a dry cleaning fluid, a liquid polyisobutylene sold by Exxon under the Vistanex trademark and esters such as dioctylphtalate. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymer dispersion is an aqueous dispersion of PTFE particles stabilized by an added nonionic surface active agent. The filler material is a ceramic grade titanium dioxide and the fibers are borosilicate glass fibers, all of which are believed to have a negative charge. A flocculating agent is added to the mixture to agglomerate the filler, the PTFE particles and the fibers.The water is removed from the agglomerate to provide a dried crumb dough. The lubricant Is mixed with the dried crumb dough so as to uniformly disperse the lubricant and to break up the large aggregates of the dough. The mixture of the lubricant and the dough provides a material which is still dry in appearance and in a crumb or fibrous particle form.The material may then be formed by conventional methods, such as, for example, paste extrusion and or calendering.After the dough is formed into the desired shape, the formed shape, whether a sheet or some other shape, is dried in a vented forced air circulation oven for 16 to 24 hours at 200 to 300 C. The dried dielectric material may be cut or trimmed to desired dimensions. Subsequent to formation of the desired dielectric material, conductive plates or foil are adhered to the dielectric material. It is preferred that the conductive plates be made from topper foil having a thickness of between about 3 and about 68 micrometers, most preferably 34 micrometers. The formed sheets and the conductive plates are laminated together using heat and pressure to cause densification of the sheets and adhesion of the sheets to each other and to the conductive plates. The above described process of the present invention provides a unique microwave circuit board. The circuit boards provided by the present invention have various properties that make the microwave circuit board particularly useful. One important aspect of the present invention is the provision of a microwave circuit board wherein strain relief is reduced. As mentioned earlier, strain relief is a measurement of the dimensional changes of the microwave circuit board after a portion of the conductive foil has been removed by an etchant or a solvent. As would be understood by one skilled in the art, it is highly desirable to reduce the dimensional changes of the circuit board because of the high tolerances within which these circuit boards are to be used. Strain relief is measured by determining the dimensional change of a strip specimen due to removal of the conductive foil. Sometimes the change in dimension is retarded by viscoelastic behavior of the composite. It has been found that a brief heat exposure after foil removal accelerates the change in dimension. In the case of PTFE, titania and microfiber glass composites described as the preferred embodiment of this invention as well as other microwave circuit board materials based on PTFE, the following procedure for measuring strain relief is believed to be satisfactory 1. A 25 millimeter strip of the material is cut, taking care to avoid flexing or other mishandling that would impose strains on the specimen. 2. Use a sharp stylus to mark two points on the metal foil, about 300 mm apart, on the same side of the specimen. 3. Condition the specimens for 24 hours in standard laboratory conditions, 230C, 50 R.H. 4. Measure in the same atmosphere the distance between centers of the marks using an optical method capable of 5 micrometer resolution. 5. Mask an area encompassing each mark about 12 millimeters square using a pressure sensitive tape capable of withstanding etching conditions. 6. Chemically etch away the metal foil, except for the masked areas. This can be done with various etchants known to those versed in the art, such as solutions of ferric chloride or ammonium persulphate. Rinse the etched specimen in clean water. 7. Remove the masks. 8. Bake the specimen for one hour at l500C followed by conditioning as in step 3. 9. Measure the distance between centers of the marks. 10. Calculate dimension change as mm change per meter of original length between marks. Another important property of the circuit board provided by the present invention is that the circuit board is moisture resistant. Moisture resistance is measured by weighing specimens of the dielectric material from which the metal foil has been removed by etching followed by washing and drying for 1 hour at 1500C. The weighing is done before and after a water immersion test and the amount of water absorbed is determined. Water immersion is for 48 hours at 500C. It has been found that with the preferred embodiment of this invention, it is possible to fabricate circuit boards that absorb less than about 0.3 weight percent water when subjected to the afore mentioned test. A further important property of the circuit board provided by the method of the present invention is that a circuit board having a relatively high dielectric constant is provided, the dielectric constant being quite uniform throughout the entire circuit board. The dielectric constant is measured for a circuit board having a total thickness of between about 0.2 and 3.0 millimeters, the total thickness including two sheets of copper foil each having a thickness of about 34 micrometers. It has been found that with the described method, it is possible to provide a circuit board having a dielectric constant in the range of about 10 to about 11 and having a uniformity of .25. The dielectric constant is measured at microwave frequencies by employing adaptations of one of the test methods described in American Society of Testing and Materials Standard Methods D 3380 or D 2520. With these as background information we have found that an effective method involves etching two resonator elements of differing lengths with their appropriate probe lines onto a given specimen.The etched specimen together with a matching specimen etched free of foil are clamped between conductive plates to form an assembly containing two stripline resonators. The resonant frequencies in the 8 to 12.5 GHz range and the lengths of these resonators are determined at a clamping stress of 2 70 kg cm . From these data one may then calculate the fring ing correction for the resonator length and the dielectric constant. The calculation is based on the known fact that the propagation velocity of a transverse electrical mode electromagnetic wave through a dielectric medium having a magnetic permeability of unity is related directly to the square root of the inverse of the dielectric constant. Another important property of the circuit board provided by the method of the present invention is that the circuit board has a relatively low energy dissipation factor at high frequencies. At 10 G Hertz, the circuit board usually has a dissipation factor of less than about .005.The dissipation factor is measured as follows The half power width of the resonant frequency peak in the stripline resonator method described before is divided by the resonant frequency to give a dissipation ratio for both metal and dielectric. An estimation value for the metal is calculated and subtracted from the ratio to give dissipation factor of the dielectric material. EXAMPLE 1 The ingredients were slurried as follows 45 liters of tap water were placed in a 20 gallon tank and mixed with 148 grams of microfiber Johns Manville s 104E glass fiber pre crushed by rolling . The water and microfibers were mixed for about ten minutes. The filler containing 2520 grams of solids, a titania filler sold by National Lead ln dustries under the trademark Titanox 3030 was added and was mixed with the microfiber and water mixture for five minutes.A polymer dispersion of PTFE, believed prepared by emulsion polyminzation of TFE in the presence of a perfluoroalkane carboxy salt emulsifying agent and stabilized after polymerization by the addition of about 0.7 nonionic surface active agent poly ethyleneoxy nonyl phenol, sold by ICI under the trademark Fluon AD 704 was added and was mixed for about 10 minutes. The level of water was brought up to 50 liters with additional water. The slurry was mixed for five minutes and then a flocculant was added. The flocculant used in this example was poly ethyleneimine PEI in a oneweight percent solution. Eighty grams of 1 solution was added to the slurry and the slurry was mixed for about 1 2 minutes. Additional flocculant solution was added in small increments until the flocculation resulted in clear water between the flocs.The total amount of flocculant solution added was about 120 grams. The flocculated solids suspended in water were transferred to a nylon fabric filter bag to allow gravity drainage of the water, thereby providing a wet, crumbly dough having approximately 68 solids. The crumb was then spread in a one inch thick layer in shallow trays and dried for 24 hours at 160 0C in a forced air circulation oven. The dried crumb was in the form of small chunks. Thereafter, the dried crumb was mixed with a lubricant. The lubricant used was dipropylene glycol DPG sold by Union Carbide Corporation.DPG is non toxic as a liquid or as a vapor and has a relatively low volatility at room temperature. A blender was used to mix the aggregates of dried crum and uniformly dispurse the lubricant. For 3,900 grams of crub, 688 grams of lubricant was added. The lubricated dough was then formed into sheets.First, the lubricated dough was formed into a billet having dimensions 38 mm diamier by about 40 mm height. The billets were then extrusion pressed at about 844 kg cm2 at a speed of about 76 mm per minute through a 4.8 mm diameter die to produce a ropelike extrudate of about 5 mm diameter. This was then passed through a 2 roll calender with a .25 mm gap setting to produce a ribbon. The X direction is considered parallel to the extrusion and the Y direction perpendicular to the X direction in the plane of the ribbon. These coordinates are discussed in connection with the finished clad panels. Several layers of ribbon were combined in two calendering operations in the X direction and the spacing between the rollers of the calender was 1.14 mm and 0.889 mm respectively. The calender roll force against gap determining stops was set as 6.3 kg cm at the selected gap on the two 203 mm diameter cylinders of the calender. Sheets 325 mm long were cut from the extruded ribbon and were extended by repeated calendering passes in the Y direction to form sheets about 305 mm wide and at least 508 mm long. The sheets were laid in a stack on clean, aluminum trays and dried in a vented forced air circulation oven for 24 hours at 246 C whereafter the sheets were trimmed accurately to an 280 by 457 mm sheet. The sheets were clad with copper foil rolled to a thickness of about 34 micrometers and surface treated for adhesion on one side. The foil was cut to sheet size of 470 by 292 mm. The composite sheets were stacked to attain the desired thickness and assembled between copper foil and stainless steel caul plates to form a layup or laminating package that was then wrapped in an aluminum foil envelope folded and rolled at the edges to exclude air. The package was clamped between cold platens in a laminating press at 2 about 35 kg cm . This pressure was maintained through a heating and cooling procedure that caused the composite to undergo crystalline melt and limited flow to accomplish densification and adhesion of the sheets to adjacent sheets or adjacent foil in the layup. The heating was done by electrical heating elements in the platens controlled thermostatically to maintain a package temperature of 396 0C for 45 minutes.At the end of this period the heating circuits were turned off and the platens and package allowed to cool over an additional 3 to 4 hour period to a temperature below 150 0C at which point the press was opened and the laminated panels were removed from between the plates. The microwave circuit boards were tested for the various properties indicated in Table 1. EXAMPLE 2 A lubricated dough compound was prepared by exactly the same method as in example 1 except that a slight change was made in the proportion of polymer, fiber, and filler so that they were present in 62.8, 3.7 and 33.5 parts by weight respectively. The lubricated dough was then molded into bricks having dimensions of 50 mm by 150 mm by 50 mm height. These were then press extruded through a slit die having a slit opening of about 2.5 mm by 150 mm to produce a ribbon shaped extension which was then calendered one pass in the X direction and cut into 318 mm lengths which were then calendered in the Y direction to produce sheets of about 500 mm lengthY direction by about 300 mm in the X direction. The sheets were then dried and laminated into panels the same as example l except that the claping stress used in the press was about 53 kg cm2 the temperature was about 388 C and the time at temperature was about 225 minutes. Data on typical panels prepared by this example are shown in Table 2. EXAEIPLE 3 A series of formulations were processed to the condition of a wet dough by a procedure similar to that of example 1 except for slight changes in the relative proportions of polymer, filler and fiber as shown in Table 3. Instead of drying the wet dough before processing it into sheets these formulations were formed into sheets by evenly spreading the wet crum onto a carrier sheet of polyester plastic film and passing this through the nip of a two roll calender several times to form a self supporting cohesive sheet which was then peeled from the plastic film and subjected to further calender passes until a suitable sheet of desired thickness and size was obtained. This more difficult procedure was necessary because it was found too difficult to extrude the wet dough into a rope or ribbon. The formed sheets were then dried for sixteen hours at 105 to 204 C in a forced air circulator oven. The dried sheets were assembled with 34 ism thick copper foil and stainless steel caul plates into laminating packages. Laminating was accomplished by the following steps 1. The package was precompressed by subjecting 2 it to a stress of 70 kg cm2 for minute in a press with platens at about 23 C. 2. The package wqas hated and sheets and foil were bonded together by clamping the package at 17.3 kg cm2 in a press with plates already heated to 388 0C. The package was held in this condition for a period of 50 minutes. 3. The package was densified and cooled by rapidly transferring it to a press with platens at about 230C 2 where it was clamped at 34.7 kg cm until the package tem perature was below 150 0C.
