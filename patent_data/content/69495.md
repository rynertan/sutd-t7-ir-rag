# HEAT SHRINKABLE THERMOPLASTIC PACKAGING FILM AND RECEPTACLES FORMED THEREFROM

## Abstract
The invention provides a multi layer, heat shrinkable, thermoplastic packaging film which can be heat sealed to itself to provide strong seals at pasteurizing temperatures. The preferred film has four layers including, in order, a sealing surface layer comprising a blend of propylene ethylene copolymer and butene 1 ethylene copolymer, a layer comprising ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer which may be cross linked to further increase high temperature strength of the film as desired a relatively gas impermeable layer comprising a copolymer of vinylidene chloride and a surface layer of the same blend as the sealing layer. Receptacles such as end seal and side seal bags can be made from the film at a faster rate than with prior art films and these receptacles have the high temperature seal qualities of propylene polymers and the hot water shrink capabilities of ethylene polymers.
