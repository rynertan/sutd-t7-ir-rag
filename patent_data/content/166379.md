# Brazed composite compact implement.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved implement comprising a ce mented carbide supported composite abrasive compact which is brazed to a cemented carbide substrate with a brazing filler metal having a liquidus substantially above 700 C. The composite compact preferably is a composite polycrystalline diamond compact. The brazing filler metal is a brazing alloy having a liquidus not substantially above 1,004 C and which has the following composition, by weight Au 18 39.5 Ni 3.5 14.5 Pd 2.5 10.5 Mn 7.5 9.0 Cu Balance.
