## Description
This invention relates to DNA sequences of the EBV genome coding at least for parts of EBV related antigenic determinants for the diagnosis, prophylassis or therapy of EBV related diseases. Furthermore, it relates to methods of localising and isolating at least a part of the respective DNA sequences. Furthermore the invention relates to recombinant DNA molecules i.e. cloning and expression vectors useful for the production of antigenic determinants of said EBV related antigens after introduction of these vectors into appropriate hosts such as bacteria, yeasts and mammalian cells. Finally this invention relates to methods and compositions or kits, respectively, for a rapid, simple, highly sensitive and highly specific determination of antibodies directed to EBV related antigens. In these tests different antigens of EBV are used to detect specific antibody classes in the patient s serum, directed to these antigens. This detection allows fairly reliable conclusions as to the status of infection of the serum donor such as preinfection, fresh infection, chronic infection, convalescence and neoplastic condition. Furthermore, this invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. vaccines containing said antigens useful for prophylaxis and therapy of EBV related diseases. The herpesviruses Herpetoviridiae are enveloped icosahedral capsids with an overall diameter of 15o nm. The viral genome consists of a double stranded DNA with a molecular weight of approximately 1o⁸ D. Human herpesviruses are Herpes simplex I fever blisters , Herpes simplex II genital herpes , Varicella Zoster chickenpox, shingles , Cytomegalovirus congenital abnormalities, e.g. microcephaly , and Epstein Barr Virus EBV infectious mononucleosis IM , Burkitt s lymphoma BL , nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC Herpesviruses display a remarkable propensity for establishing latent infections which may persist for the life of the host. After the primary infection the virus may remain quiescent, being demonstrable only sporadically or not at all, until it is reactivated by one of several known types of stimulus, such as irradiation or immunosuppression. Such exacerbations of endogenous disease may take the form of a crop of vesicles on the skin in the case of herpes simplex or zoster, or more generalized effects in the case of cytomegalovirus or EBV. The capacity to persist indefinitely as a latent infection enables these viruses to survive in nature for a long time. During the last years, attention has turned to the correlation of human cancer and EBV. EBV causes infectious mononucleosis as a primary disease. Predominantly it affects children or young adults. More than 9o of the average adult population is infected by EBV that persists for lifetime in peripheral B lymphocytes. The virus is lifelong produced in the parotid gland and spread via the oral route. Serology suggests that EBV might be involved in causing two neoplastic diseases of man, African Burkitt s lymphoma BL and nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC . Infectious mononucleosis is a consequence of primary infection by EBV. It is not a life threatening disease if additional risk factors are absent. However, the subjective feeling of sickness, frequently for extended periods in the order of several weeks , and the necessity to avoid physical stress due to the drastically increased risk of spleenic rupture would certainly suggest a control of this disease. The clinical diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is usually derived from a combination of the following parameters Patients with infectious mononucleosis shed EBV in their saliva. Virus shedding does not require special prevention against spreading the disease as epidemics and infection of persons in close contact are rare A.S. Evans, The transmission of EB viral infections. Viral Infections in Oral Medicine. , edited by J. Hooks, G. Jordan, Elsevier North Holland Amsterdam, p. 211 1982 . Virus shedding does not stop with recovery from disease and at least 60 possibly up to 1oo of the adult population shed at least low levels of EBV which is produced lifelong in epithelial cells of the salivary duct of the parotid gland H. Wolf, M. Haus, E. Wilmes, Persistence of Epstein Barr virus in the parotid gland , J. Virol. 51 1984 . About 1 of the infectious mononucleosis cases show complications either already at the onset of the disease or as a late consequence. Most complications are due to autoimmune mechanisms and are in some cases indiscernable from graft versus host disease, a mechanism by which the body might clear itself from the excess of EBV converted proliferating B cells. If the T cell response is insufficient, e.g. due to circumstances like treatment with high doses of Cyclosporin A in combination with corticosteroids or due to AIDS or a certain genetic predisposition as described by Purtilo Duncan s syndrome, X chromosome linked lympho proliferative disease XLP D.T. Purtilo, K. Sakamoto, V. Barnabei, J. Seeley, T. Bechtolg, G. Rogers, J. Yetz, S. Harada and the XLP collaborators Epstein Barr virus induced diseases in boys with the X linked lympho proliferative syndrome XLP . Update on studies of the registry. Am. J. Med. 73, p. 49 1982 , infected B cells may have a chance to escape from host control and grow without limitation as they would do when being cultivated in vitro. The consequences have been described as BL like disease in cases of AIDS patients J.L. Ziegler, R.C. Miner, E. Rosenbaum, E.T. Lennette, E. Shillitoe, C. Casavant, W.L. Drew, L. Mintz, J. Gershor, J. Greenspan, J. Beckstead, K. Yamamoto, Outbreak of Burkitt s like lymphoma in homosexual men. , Lancet 2, p. 631 1982 or as a polyclonal lympho proliferative disease for XLP patients D.T. Purtilo et al., supra or kidney transplant recipients D.W. Hanto, G. Frizzera, D.T. Purtilo, K. Sakamoto, J.L. Sullivan, A.K. Saemundsen, G. Klein, R.L. Simmons, J.S. Najarian, Clinical spectrum of lympho proliferative disorders in renal transplant recipients and evidence for the role of Epstein Barr virus. , Cancer Res. 41, p. 4253 1981 . The positive and fast identification of infectious mononucleosis or acute EBV infection is especially important in cases where a differential diagnosis to leukemia or, in case of transplant recipient, to graft rejection crisis is necessary. In these cases, a false diagnosis may lead to incorrect therapy, which may have serious, even life threatening effects. Infectious mononucleosis seems to be unknown in areas like the Philippines or Malaysia D.S.K. Tan, Absence of infectious mononucleosis among Asians in Malaya. , Med. J. Malaya 21, p. 358 1967 where infection by EBV occurs very early in life. Almost the whole population has antibodies at the age of 2 1o years at the latest. Clinical symptoms seem to be a consequence of juvenile or adult infection. It can be assumed that a vaccine primed organism will be infected without significant clinical symptoms and that the consequences often fatal in the risk groups listed above could be eliminated by a vaccine. The development of Burkitt s lymphoma is linked to chromosomal rearrangements. Not all cases contain EBV genomes in the tumor cells. However, at least in areas with high incidence, 97 of these neoplasias are EBV elated and a control of EBV infection is likely to reduce the risk of developing Burkitt s lymphoma. The other disease where EBV shows a 1oo association is nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC The Biology of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma , UICC technical report series, vol. 71, edited by M.J. Simons and K. Shanmugaratnam, International Union Against Cancer, Geneva, p. 1 1982 . NPC most frequently starts at the fossa of Rosenmueller Recessus pharyngeus at the postnasal space. Frequently patients are hospitalized only after the first typical metastases have developed in the cervical lymph nodes. In some areas of Southern China and amongst Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia, NPC is the most frequent neoplasia of man with an incidence of up to 4o per 1oo,ooo per year. In other parts of the world, like Borneo or Tunesia the incidence is also high. In most other areas, the incidence is around o,2 per 1oo,ooo per year which represents about 4 of ear, nose and throat ENT tumors. The age distribution shows a clear single peak around the age of 4o to 5o in almost all high risk areas. In Borneo and to some extent in Tunesia, a remarkable second peak has, however, been observed at an early age ranging from 5 to 15 years M. J. Simons et al., supra . Environmental factors including traditional Chinese medicine may be responsible for the increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in certain, predominantly Chinese, populations of Southern Asia H. Wolf, Biology of Epstein Barr virus in Immune deficiency and cancer Epstein Barr virus and lymphoproliferative malignancies , ed. D. Purtilo, Plenum Press, p. 233 1984 . There are three possible basic strategies to control neoplasia These goals may be achieved also in multifactorial diseases such as many neoplasias. Incidence of disease may be reduced by eliminating one or more of the essential factors which are not necessarily sufficient by themselves to cause the disease, or by reducing factors which promote the manifestation of neoplastic conditions. The use of the specific virus related antigens of this invention, or antibodies or genetic materials as tools for early diagnosis of virus related tumors, might facilitate the elimination of essential factors. EBV infects B lymphocytes during acute or primary infection mononucleosis . Due to the lack of immune response, a number of cells enter into the lytic cycle and produce a full set of viral antigens which are shed into the blood stream during cytolysis. Against these antigens, specific antibodies will be synthesized by the host s immune system Table A . Probably not all B lymphocytes are capable of supporting a fully lytic infection due to a cellular factor which prevents expression of EBV. These cells are latently carrying EBV genomes for the rest of the host s life. As the immune defense mechanisms of the body remove the lytically infected cells from the circulation, the antibody levels will start to fall during the convalescent phase. After a certain period, anti EA antibodies disappear. However, as mentioned above, EBV is produced in the parotid gland. The viral particles and intracellular virus associated antigens including EA will be shed into the saliva and reach the oropharynx. Here the viral particles bind to the B lymphocytes and are presented to the body as antigens, thus the antibody titer against VCA is maintained. Since EA cannot bind to the lymphocytes it will be degraded by poteases and therefore will not be available to the immunesystem as an antibody inducing antigen. The circulating lymphocytes that are latently infected by EBV contain EBNA. At the end of their life cycle these cells disintegrate and release EBNA into the blood stream. Therefore antibodies to this antigen will persist. Thus, due to the EBV production in the parotid gland and to the release of EBNA from latently infected B cells, sera of convalescents will have low anti VCA and anti EBNA IgG antibody levels see Table A, supra . In addition EA released from rare B lymphocytes which may enter a lytic cycle may be an inferior antigen and may not give rise to antibody levels detectable with the test systems used. In combination with the known sequence of appearance of antibody classes, specifically the early presence of IgM antibodies followed by IgG antibodies, the various antigen classes of primary disease caused by EBV can be utilized for improved diagnostic procedures. However, available test systems which are mainly based on cellular antigens or cell derived antigens have serious limitations. This concerns one sensitivity, especially for detection of IgM antibodies and also unspecific reactions. The first suggestive evidence that Epstein Barr virus might be causally related to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and African Burkitt s Lymphoma was derived from serological data for review see M.A. Epstein, B.G. Achong, The Epstein Barr Virus Springer Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, New York 1979 . Using mainly indirect immunofluorescence on cells producing virus or at least early viral antigens, significantly higher antibody titers to these antigens were found in patients sera. These first tests which detected unspecified immunoglobulin classes against a group of proteins named Early Antigen EA and another group of proteins named Virus Capsid Antigens VCA were helpful for the establishment of a relationship between EBV and these diseases. These tests, however, are of limited value for definite diagnosis of the malignancies from a single serum, and cannot be used for monitoring therapy. The introduction of antigen and antibody class specific tests, specifically the determination of peripheral IgA antibodies for the two antigen families EA and VCA and also the first attempts to subdivide at least the EA family EA, D or R G. Henle, W. Henle and G. Klein, Demonstration of 2 distinct components in the early antigen complex of Epstein Barr Virus infected cells ,Int. J. Cancer 8, p. 272 1971 achieved remarkable improvements of the diagnostic and prognostic value of the tests. In the areas of high risk for NPC, 1 of the adult population has IgA antibodies for EBV Capsid antigen VCA . Three percent of this group has NPC upon clinical examination and, with the exception of terminal cases, there were no anti VCA IgA negative cases detected. Out of the IgA anti VCA positives, about 1 per year developed NPC in a 3 year follow up. A test of this quality, if available as a highly specific automat readable ELISA test, would provide an excellent first step screening for a population of extreme risk. Detection of EB virus IgA VCA antibody is helpful for diagnosis of NPC see table on page 14 , and of special value for the detection of early stages. For example, in Wuzhou City China high risk area for NPC , the frequency of NPC detected by serological mass survey revealed a much higher percentage of patients in stages I 42 and II 48 than otherwise detected in outpatient clinics 1.7 stage I and 30 stage II . The chance of survival is clearly related to the stage at which therapy is begun. The survival rates for stage I are according to Shanghai Tumor Hospital 93 , for stage II 75 , and are very low for more advanced stages. Therefore it is possible to reduce the mortality rate of NPC through early detection and early treatment. IgA antibodies to the early antigen complex of EBV can be detected in 40 to 70 of NPC patients, depending on the method used. These antibodies are virtually absent in the non tumorbearing population. Such test of the tumorbearing individuals should be of great importance for the decision to start therapy, and its value would be even higher if the sensitivity could be enhanced to allow detection of disease in closer to 100 of the tumor patients. The detection rate of NPC among IgA VCA antibody positive individuals is 1.9 and that of IgA EA individuals is 30 40 . These data indicate that the IgA EA antibody test is more specific for the detection of NPC, but not as sensitive as IgA VCA antibody. A number of laboratories have used the continuous determination of IgA antibodies to EA and VCA to monitor the success of therapy and for early detection of relapse with very good success. Four proteins of the viral envelope constituting the so called membrane antigen complex MA have been described L.F. Qualtiere, G.R. Pearson, et. al., supra J. North, A.J. Morgan, M.A. Epstein, Observations on the EB virus envelope and virus determined membrane antigen MA polypeptides , Int. J. Cancer 26, p. 231 1980 . Two of these proteins, i.e. gp 250 and gp 350, are antigentically closely related D.A. Thorley Lawson and K. Geilinger, Monoclonal antibodies against the major glycoprotein gp 250 350 of Epstein Barr virus neutralize infectivity , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 77, p. 5307 1980 . The molecular weight of one component ranges from 200,000 to 250,000 D depending on the cell line where the virus is derived from and the second antigenetically related glycoprotein has a molecular weight of 300,000 350,000 D but is absent in some cell lines. Since these glycoproteins are all related in antigenicity, protein and encoding DNA sequence, they are usually referred to as gp 220 350 or gp 250 350 or simply as gp 250 or gp 350 but meaning the whole family of related glycoproteins see also EP A 151079 . Glycoprotein 250 350 is able to bind to the EBV receptor of human and some primate B lymphocytes and to thus initiate the infection of these cells A. Wells, N. Koide, G. Klein, Two large virion envelope glycoproteins mediate Epstein Barr virus binding to receptor positive cells , J. Virol. 41, p. 286 1982 . Antibodies against these proteins neutralize the infectivity of the virus, which could be demonstrated for human as well as for rabbit antisera and mouse monoclonal antibodies D.A. Thorley Lawson et. al., supra . By the use of monoclonal antibodies it has been shown that blocking of only one antigenic determinant present both in gp 350 and gp 250 was sufficient for virus neutralization. Adsorption of human sera to immobilized gp 350 and gp 250 removed the neutralizing antibodies D.A. Thorley Lawson et. al., supra . Thus, there is convincing evidence that Therefore, this protein as well as its related viral gene product, gp 350 with a molecular weight of 350,000 , are candidates for a possible EBV vaccine A.J. Morgan, M.A. Epstein, J.R. North, Comparative immunogenicity studies on Epstein Barr virus membrane antigen MA gp 34o with novel adjuvants in mice, rabbits and cotton top tamarins , J. Med. Virol. 13, p. 281 1984 . These glycoproteins are expressed on induced EBV producer cell lines and can be easily demonstrated after radioiodination of cell surface proteins L.F. Qualtiere, G.R. Pearson, Epstein Barr virus induced membrane antigens immuno chemical characterization of Triton X 1oo solubilized viral membrane antigens from EBV superinfected Raji cells , Int. J. Cancer 23, p. 808 1979 . IgG antibodies are absent during the acute phase of primary EBV infection, but present for lifetime after convalescence. IgM antibodies are present in the early stage of the disease and absent during convalescence. IgA antibodies against EBV antigens are present almost exclusively in NPC patients and can be detected in sera of at least 58 of these patients even with not very sensitive tests Zeng Yi and Hans Wolf, manuscript in preparation and example 16, infra . The whole gp 25o molecule or parts of its backbone polypeptide chain can be utilized as reagents in preferentially class specific antibody detection tests such as passive hemagglutination, counter gel electrophoresis, radio immunoassays or enzyme linked immuno absorbent assays. Highly specific test antigens allow better signals and detect otherwise unrevealed low antibody levels of clinical significance. The use of singular antigenic sites of the gp 25o instead of the entire gene product may, in some cases, permit a more precise diagnosis of the disease. Prokaryotes most frequently are represented by various strains of E. coli. However, other microbial strains may also be used, such as bacilli, for example Bacillus subtilis, various species of Pseudomonas, or other bacterial strains. In such prokaryotic systems, plasmid vectors which contain replication sites and control sequences derived from a species compatible with the host are used. For example, E. coli is typically transformed using derivatives of pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species by Bolivar, et al., Gene 2, p. 95 1977 . pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance, and these markers can be either retained or destroyed in constructing the desired vector. Commonly used prokaryotic control sequences which are defined herein to include promoters for transcription initation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences, include such commonly used promoters as the beta lactamase penicillinase and lactose lac promoter systems Chang, et. al. Nature 198, p. 1056 1977 and the tryptophan trp promoter system Goeddel, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 8, p. 4057 1980 and the E. coli lipoprotein promoter system. The lambda derived P In addition to bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, such as yeast, may also be used as hosts. Laboratory strains or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Baker s yeast, are most used, although a number of other strains are commonly available. While vectors employing the 2 micron origin of replication are illustrated J.R. Broach, Meth. Enz. 101, p. 307 1983 , other plasmid vectors suitable for yeast expression are known see, for example, Stinchcomb et al., Nature 282, p. 39 1979 Tschempe et al., Gene 10, p.157 1980 and L. Clarke et al., Meth. Enz. 101, p. 300 1983 . Control sequences for yeast vectors include promoters for the synthesis of glycolytic enzymes Hess et. al., J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 7, p. 149 1968 Holland et al., Biochemistry 17, p. 4900 1978 . Additional promoters known in the art include the promoter for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255, p. 2073 1980 , and those for other glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose 6 phosphate isomerase, 3 phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Other promoters, which have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization Holland, supra . Evidence suggests that terminator sequences are desirable at the 3 end of the coding sequences. Such terminators are found in the 3 untranslated region following the coding sequences in yeast derived genes. Many of the vectors illustrated contain control sequences derived from the enolase I gene containing plasmid peno46 M.J. Holland et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256, p. 1385 1981 or the LEU 2 gene obtained from YEp13 J. Broach et al., Gene 8, p. 121 1979 , however, any vector containing a yeast compatible promoter, origin of replication and other control sequences is suitable. It is also, of course, possible to express genes encoding polypeptides in eukaryotic host cell cultures derived from multicellular organisms. See, for example, Cruz and Patterson, editors, Tissue Cultures , Academic Press 1973 . Useful host cell lines include VERO and HeLa cells, and Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells. Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include promoters and control sequences compatible with mammalian cells such as, for example, the commonly used early and late promoters from Simian Virus 40 SV 40 Fiers et al., Nature 273, p. 113 1978 , or other viral promoters such as those derived from polyoma. Adeno virus 2, bovine papiloma virus, or avian sarcoma virusses. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by Axel in U.S. Patent No. 4,399,216 issued August 16, 1983. It now appears also that enhancer regions are important in optimizing expression these are, generally, sequences found frequently upstream of the promoter region. Origins of replication may be obtained, if needed, from viral sources. However, gene integration into the chromosome is a common mechanism for DNA replication in eukaryotes, and hence independently replicating vectors are not required. Plant cells are also now available as hosts, and control sequences compatible with plant cells such as the nopaline synthase promoter and polyadenylation signal sequences A. Depicker et al., J. Mol. Appl. Gen. 1, p. 561 1982 are available. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described by S.N. Cohen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69, p. 2110 1972 is used for prokaryotes or other cells which contain substantial cell wall barriers. Infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens C.H. Shaw et al., Gene 23, p. 315 1983 is used for certain plant cells. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb Virology 52, p. 546 1978 is preferred. Transformations into yeast are carried out according to the method of P. van Solingen et al. J. Bact. 130, p. 946 1977 and C. L. Hsiao et al. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, p. 3829 1979 . Alternatively, the procedure of Klebe, et al. Gene 25, p. 333 1983 can be used. Construction of suitable vectors containing the desired coding and control sequences employs standard ligation and restriction techniques which are well understood in the art. Isolated plasmids, DNA sequences, or synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides are cleaved, tailored and religated in the form desired. Site specific DNA cleavage is performed by treating with the suitable restriction enzyme or enzymes under conditions which are generally understood in the art, and the particulars of which are specified by the manufacturer of these commercially available restriction enzymes. See, e.g., New England Biolabs, Product Catalog. If desired, size separation of the cleaved fragments may be performed by polyacrylamide gel or agarose gel electrophoresis using standard techniques. A general description of size separations is found in Methods in Enzymology 65, p. 499 560 1980 . Restriction cleaved fragments may be blunt ended by treating with the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow in the presence of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates dNTPs . The Klenow fragment fills in at 5 sticky ends but chews back protruding 3 single strands, even though the four dNTPs are present. If desired, selective repair can be performed by supplying only a selected one or more dNTPs within the limitations dictated by the nature of the sticky ends. Treatment under appropriate conditions with S1 nuclease results in hydrolysis of any single stranded portion. Synthetic oligonucleotides may be prepared by the triester method of Matteucci et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, p. 3185 1981 or the diethylphosphoramidite method or Caruthers, described in U.S. Patent No. 4,415,732, issued November 15, 1983. Ligations are performed under standard conditions and temperatures as described below using T4 DNA ligase. In vector constructions employing vector fragments , the vector fragment is commonly treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP in order to remove the 5 phosphate and prevent religation of the vector. BAP digestions are carried out under standard conditions as described below . In the constructions correct ligations for plasmid construction are confirmed by transforming E. coli or other suitable costs with the ligation mixture. Successful transformants are selected by ampicillin, tetracycline or other antibiotic resistance or using other markers depending on the mode of plasmid construction, as is understood in the art. The present invention relates to the production of EBV specific antigenic determinants by recombinant DNA technology and their use in diagnosis, prophylaxis and therapy of EBV related dieseases. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to identify novel Epstein Barr viral antigens, such as p150, p143, p138, p110, p105, p90, p80, p54 G.J. Bayliss, H. Wolf, infra , which are correlated with Epstein Barr virus related diseases like nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC , infectious mononucleosis, and Burkitt s lymphoma see legend to Fig. 1 and Fig. 28 by immunological methods. Another object of this invention is the localization and identification of genomic regions of EBV, for example as it has been cloned from B95 8 cells American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, USA ATCC CRL1612 J. Skare, J.L. Strominger, Cloning and mapping of BamHI endonuclease fragments of the DNA from the transforming B95 8 strain of Epstein Barr Virus , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, p3860 1980 coding for said antigens of diagnostic importance and of relevance for medical purposes. This is achieved by using the hybrid selection method. A further object of the present invention is the subcloning of a genomic region of EBV,for example from existing libraries of EBV, cloned from B95 8 cells which encodes at least a part of useful antigens for medical purposes, such as p138 and p150. This is achieved by joining a subgenomic fragment, e.g. an XhoI fragment, derived from the EBV B95 8 subclone pBR322 BamA, J.Skare et al., supra to the plasmid pUC8 J. Messing, infra Another object of this invention is the production of proteins by expression of the respective genetic information in suitable host cells, such as bacteria e.g. of the genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas or Bacillus , yeasts e.g. of the genera Candida or Saccharomyces animal cells and human cells e.g. Vero cells CHO cells CHO dhfr cells in combination with an appropriate selection system, optionally a plasmid carrying a functional dhfr gene as well as the genetic information for the EBV gene under control of a suitable regulation sequence or lymphoblastoid cell lines . The proteins produced by these host cells contain e.g. p138, p150 or gp250 350 related antigenic determinants epitopes and are, depending on the expression system, synthesized either as a fusion protein or as a non fusion protein. For the production of a fusion protein by bacteria the expression of the genomic subfragments, for example that encoding a part of p138 of EBV B95 8 and introduced into the known plasmid pUC8, was induced e.g. by isopropyl β D thioglactopyranoside IPTG . The respective expression products were identified by immunological methods. Another fusion protein is provided by cleaving subclone pUC635 with EcoRI and BglII and introducing this fragment into the vector plasmid pUC9 U. Rüther, infra . The resulting recombinant plasmid is A further fusion protein is produced by expressing the genetic information of said XhoI p138 encoding fragment of pBR322 BamA in the plasmid pEA305 E. Amann, J. Brosius, M. Ptashne, Vectors bearing a hybrid trp lac promoter useful for regulated expression of cloned genes in E. coli , Gene 25, p. 167 1983 . After putting the p138 related information into a proper reading frame relative to pEA305, the clone Still another fusion protein is provided by cloning a 3.0 kb genomic XhoI fragment containing p138 related genetic information 3 to a hybrid trp lac promoter as described by F. Amann et. al., supra . For this purpose the known plasmid pKK240 11 was used. The resulting clone Still another object of the present invention is to provide fusion proteins, non fusion proteins or oligopeptides which contain only the antigenic determinant protein subregions of viral proteins like p138. For this purpose the determinants of the protein are located by a computer directed analysis, using a computer program developed by us for the Digital Equipment VAX 11 750 computer. A similar program has been used for other problems and another computer by G.H. Cohen, B. Dietzschold, M. Ponce de Leon, D. Long, E. Golub, A. Varrichio. L. Pereira, R.J. Eisenberg, Localization and synthesis of an antigenic determinant of Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D that stimulates the production of neutralizing antibody , J. Virol 49, p. 102 1984 . By cloning the respective fragments into vectors like pUC8 or pUR288 U. Rüther et al., infra plasmids as A further object of the present invention is the expression of polyantigens composed of antigenic determinants of several different EBV serotypes. For that purpose the corresponding DNA fragments are linked and introduced in a suitable vector. The expression products are fusion and non fusion EBV specific polyantigens. Further fusion proteins containing p150 related antigenic determinants were obtained by cloning and expression of the corresponding DNA sequences in pUR plasmids and pUC plasmids. The obtained constructs were the recombinant plasmids pUR290CXH580, pUR290DBX320, pUR292DBB180, pUR290DTT700, pURDTT740, pUR290DTP680, and pUR288DPP320. Another object of the present invention is the construction of new expression vectors, such as Still another object of this invention is the modification of said expression vectors by introducing a DNA sequence coding for three to fifteen Arginine residues and at least one stop codon 3 of the cloning site of said expression vectors and furthermore positioned in an appropriate reading frame. The obtained vector is Thus it is an object of this invention to provide a simple method for isolating proteins useful for diagnosis, prophylaxis and therapy such as EBV p138 or related polypeptides or oligopeptides antigens from the host cell lysate according to the method of H. M. Sassenfeld, S.J. Brewer A polypeptide fusion designed for the purification of recombinant proteins , Bio Technology 2, p. 76 1984 . It is also evident that other established methods for protein purification such as molecular sieving or affinity chromatography on ion exchange columns or columns loaded with specific antibodies to the expressed proteins can be used as additional or alternate purification methods. For the production of non fusion proteins which essentially contain amino acid sequences of the naturally occurring proteins or parts thereof the recombinant plasmids of the present invention may be modified. If an oligonucleotide linker is inserted between the bacterial protein encoding region and the EBV related protein encoding region of the expression vector, the amino acid sequence corresponding to the oligonucleotide linker becomes part ot the expressed fusion protein. After isolation of this fusion protein from the transformants expressing it, it is cleaved either by amino acid sequence specific proteases in the introduced aminoacid linker or, if the amino acid linker comprises peptide bonds sensitive to acid cleavage, by treatment with acids, e.g. formic acid. A further object of this invention is the cloning of genomic regions of EBV coding for particular parts of the specific viral antigen gp 250 and gp 350. This is achieved by joining a subgenomic PstI PstI fragment of the EBV genome from the cell strain B95 8 ATCC CRL 1612 R. Baer et al., infra contained in pBR322 BamL J. Skare et al, supra to the plasmid pUC8 J. Messing et al., infra . The resulting recombinant plasmid is designated as For the production of a fusion protein by bacteria, a genomic subfragment coding for a part of gp 250 and gp 350 of EBV B95 8 was cloned into the vector pUR 290 U. Rüther et al., infra which carries a region of the lacZ gene coding for the enzyme β galactosidase Still another object of the present invention is to provide fusion proteins or non fusion proteins which contain only the antigenic determinant protein subregions of gp 250 and gp 350. For this purpose the antigenic determinants of the proteins were localized by a computer directed analysis using a computer program developed by us for the Digital Equipment VAX 11 750 computer. The respective DNA fragments are then cloned in a conventional expression vector such as pUR β galactosidase U. Rüther, et al., infra . Plasmids obtained were e.g. A further object of the present invention is the expression of polyantigens containing several antigenic determinants of gp 250 and gp 350 located by said computer analysis. For this purpose the corresponding DNA fragments are linked and introduced in a suitable vector. The expression products are fusion and non fusion EBV specific polyantigens. A final object of the present invention is the utilization of either said EBV related proteins or subregions thereof or, if suitable, EBV related DNA fragments or clones, for the production of diagnostic compositions kits useful in clinical diagnosis or scientific research. These tests are based on principles as ELISA Enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay , RIA Radio immuno assay or the indirect hemagglutination assay. Furthermore, the EBV related proteins can be used, e.g. for monitoring vaccination programs, analyzing epidemiological problems, for patients treatment, and for the production of vaccines for prophylaxis and therapy of EBV related diseases, such as mononucleosis, Burkitt s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Vaccines can be manufactured according to conventional methods. Unit doses are filled in vials optionally together with a conventional adjuvant such as aluminium hydroxide. Alternatively the product may be administered in the form of aggregates with liposomes. Patients may be vaccinated with a dose sufficient to stimulate antibody formation and revaccinated after one month and after 6 months. The immunoprecipitated ³⁵S labelled proteins were separated by a SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an X ray film was exposed to the gel. The sources of the different sera used for precipitation are given at the bottom of the respective regions of the autoradiography. The control, designated pool , contains all of the immunoprecipitatable EBV specific proteins. It can be taken from the autoradiography that at least antibodies to p138, p105 and p80 are present in each of the NPC sera and only in some of the other EBV infection specific sera. In analogy, antibodies to p54 are significant for fresh EBV infection infectious mononucleosis as compared to convalescent state. Antibodies to p15o, p143, p11o, p90 are also present in convalescent sera of healthy individuals and can serve as markers for immunity or, in connection with IgM specific tests, for fresh EBV infection or, in connection with IgA, for a specific test for EBV related neoplasia NPC and BL . The BamHI restriction sites of the EBV B95 8 genome are given at the bottom of the figure and the respective restriction fragments are designated by upper and lower case letters. The mRNA s of the proteins localized by hybrid selection to individual BamHI restriction fragments are indicated by numbers and lines. The sequence shown is the respective negative strand. The p138 encoding region starts at nucleotide position 182 and ends at nucleotide position 3565. Restriction sites used for cloning of fragments of this coding region are indicated. The size of the vector pUC8 is 2.7 Kb. The cloning site 3 of the lacUV5 β galactosidase promoter and operator PO contains EcoRI E , BamHI B , SalI S , PstI P , and HindIII H site. The β lactamase gene is indicated by AMP. The 3.o kb and 3.3 kb xhoI fragments of the p138 coding region are inserted into the SalI site of pUC8. The insertion is indicated by an open bar. pUC635 contains the 3.o kb XhoI fragment in a correct reading frame relative to the β galactosidase gene,whereas pUC613o contains the 3.3 kb XhoI fragment in the opposite orientation. Lane 1 of the immunostained Western blot shows the proteins isolated from bacteria transformed with pUC8 and induced with IPTG. The size of the vector pUC9 is 2.7 Kb. The cloning site 3 of the lacUV5 β galactosidase promoter and operator PO contains an EcoRI E , BamHI B , SalI S , PstI P , and HindIII H site. The β lactamase gene is indicated by AMP.

The 2.6 kb BamHI HindIII fragment of pUC924 was inserted into the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of pEA3o5 which are located 3 of the hybrid trp lac promoter tac and the aminoterminal coding region of c₁ λ repressor . The 3.3 kb BamHI HindIII fragment of pUC613o was inserted into the HindIII site of the vector pKK24o 11 using a 345 bp BamHI HindIII fragment of pBR322 as a linker which is indicated by a heavy black line . Thus the p138 encoding fragment is located 3 of the hybrid trp lac promoter tac and an ATG start codon. Computer plot of Chou Fasman calculation of the p138 secondary structure. Additionally, the hydrophobic closed circles and hydrophilic open circles regions are indicated. Antigenic sites can be expected in hydrophilic regions with a β turn. This situation is given in the p6oo region and at the carboxy terminus of the protein. The regions subcloned into the vectors pUC8 and pUR288 are indicated. An enzyme linked immunoassay of proteins electrophoretically transfered from a gel onto nitrocellulose paper Western blot was carried out. In this assay a pool of high titered antiserum was used and after washing, the bound immunoglobulins were visualized by sequential reaction with peroxidase coupled to antibodies against human IgG and diaminobenzidine. The fusion protein from bacteria containing pUCP600 was stably produced and shows a specific antigenic reaction. The upper part shows a Coomassie stained SDS PAGE. The newly detected proteins are marked by a black dot. The lower part shows the corresponding western blot obtained after immunostaining with serum from NPC patients. In comparison to pUCP600 the EBV related protein encoded by pUC601 is about 1.5kD smaller due to the lack of 14 aminoacids 6 aminoacids encoded by the pUC polylinker and 8 from the PstI SstI fragment . The size of the protein encoded by pUCARG601 is further reduced for about 11kD since the read through into the lacZ region of puC is inhibited by stop codons present in the inserted oligonucleotide. In pUCARG1140 the size increases to about 42 kD due to the insertion of the 540bp fragment. The protein is stable in bacterial cells. Lysates of IPTG induced E.coli cells carrying the indicated plasmids were independently separated on a 12 SDS PAGE four times and the proteins were transferred to Nitrocellulose by Western blotting. Lanes 1 pUR288 as negative control lanes 2 pUCARG1140 as a positive control lanes 3 pUR540 lanes 4 pUR600. Two individual NPC sera no. 352 and 354 were incubated with the filters and the bound IgG and IgA antibodies were visualized using peroxidase conjugated anti human IgG and anti human IgA rabbit antibodies. The different locations of the proteins in the Western blots, especially of pUCARG1140, result from different electrophoresis times of the SDS PAGEs. Row 1 and 3 EBV negative sera, row 2 NPC pool serum, row 4 13 individual NPC sera. The dilutions tested are indicated at the bottom left lane IgG right lane IgA. The coding region for the glycoprotein starts at genomic position 92153 and ends at position 89433. The sequence shown is the respective negative strand, beginning with the BamHI site at position 92703. According to the sequence numbering in this figure the gp 350 encoding region is located between position 556 and 3276. A TATAA box in the region of basepair 520 is marked with ..., the probable poly adenylation site at position 3290 with . The splice donor and splice acceptor sites are indicated by for donor and for the acceptor site. A hydrophobic region near the carboxy terminus of the coding region is marked with . Probably this aminoacid sequence serves as an anchor sequence for fixing the protein to the membrane. The size of pUC8 is 2.7 kb. The cloning region 3 of the LacUV5 β galactosidase promoter and operator PO contains an EcoRI E , BamHI B , SalI S , PstI P , and HindIII H site. The 1.9 kb subfragment of the Bam L fragment, indicated by an open bar, was inserted into the PstI site. The reading frame has the same orientation as the lacZ coding part of pUC8 indicated by a heavy black line . The vector pUR290 has a length of 5.2 kb and consists of the β lactamase gene AMP The 1.9 kb insert of pUCLP1.9 was introduced between the BamHI and the HindIII site. Lane 1 and 2 show a coomassie blue stained PAGE of an uninduced lane 1 and an IPTG induced lane 2 pURLP1.9 containing clone. Since there are a lot of bands with different molecular weights, it seems that the main part of the protein is incompletely synthesized. Lane 3 shows a peroxidase DAB stained Western blot with NPC sera. It is demonstrated that all newly expressed proteins are antigenic, except that band according to the size of 116 kD which corresponds to the β galactosidase. The bacterial background bands are due to the high content of antibacterial antibodies in the serum used. A. Coomassie stained gel B. Western blot, treated with NPC serum Computer predicted secondary structure of gp350 comprising the relative values of hydrophilicity dark circles and hydrophobicity grey circles . In the scale given only the loop structures can be seen clearly as line turns of 180 . The coomassie blue stained expression products encoded by plasmids pURLEP600 and pURLXP390 are shown in the upper part pUR288 as control . In the lower part the same probes are shown after immunostaining for demonstrating their reactivity with EBV positive sera.

Furthermore the restriction enzymes used for subcloning, the splice sites, and the inserts of the recombinant expression plasmids constructed according to examples 13 and 15 17 are shown. IPTG induced clones indicated on top were separated after lysis in an 10 SDS PAGE and the proteins were stained with Coomassie blue. As a control pUR288 was applied to show the size of the β galactosidase. All clones produce new proteins larger than the control clone and corresponding to the insert size. The same lysates from clones shown in Fig. 29 were transferred to nitrocellulose and EBV related antigens were visualized by immuno staining see supra . The clone encoding the N terminal part reacts strongly. The p150 encoding region is shown as dark bar. The restricion sites used for subcloning and the resulting pUR clones are also indicated. In order to obtain the desired DNA sequences coding for EBV related antigens of diagnostic significance the following strategy was developed For the immunoprecipitation the EBV producing, MA positive cell line p3HR1, the EBV positive, non producing Raji cell line and the EBV negative cell line BJAB were used. When the cells reached a density of about 1o⁶ ml, they were diluted with an equal volume of fresh medium. For induction of EBV antigens, P3HR1 cultures were treated with 4o ng ml phorbol 12 mystrate 13 acetate modified from zur Hausen et al H. zur Hausen, F.J. O Neill, U.K. Freese, E. Hecker, Persisting oncogenic herpes virus induced by the tumor promotor TPA , Nature 272, p. 373 1978 and 3 mM butyric acid immediately after subculture. For the labelling of the proteins, the cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and resuspended at a density of 2 x 1o⁶ cells ml in methionine free MEM culture medium containing between 5o and 1oo µCi ml ³⁵S methionine. The cells were incubated at 37 C 5 CO₂ for 4 h and subsequently washed with cold Hanks phosphate buffered saline PBS and resuspended in cold IP buffer 1 Triton X 1oo, o.1 SDS o.137 M NaCl 1 mM CaCl₂ 1 mM MgCl₂ 1o glycerol 2o mM Tris HCl pH 9.o o,o1 NaN₃ 1µg ml phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride at a concentration of 5 x 1o⁶ cell ml. Then the cells were disrupted by sonicaton and incubated on ice for 6o min. The extracts clarified by centrifugation at 1oo,ooo x g for 3o min at 4 C. Antibodies to p138, p1o5, p90 and p80 are present in each of the NPC sera and only in some of the other EBV infection specific sera. In analogy antibodies to p54 identical to p58 in G.J. Bayliss et al., supra are significant for fresh EBV infection infectious mononucleosis as compared to convalescent state. Antibodies to p150, p143, p110 are also present in convalescent sera of healthy individuals and can serve as markers for immunity or, in connection with IgM specific tests for fresh EBV infection or, in connection with IgA specific tests, for EBV related neoplasia NPC and BL . The next step was to localize the antigens on the EBV genome. Therefore RNA was prepared by lysing the EBV producing cells described above with 4 M guanidine isothiocyanate and o.5 M 2 mercaptoethanol two days after induction J.M. Chirgwin, A.E. Przybyla, R.J. MacDonald, W.J. Rutter, Isolation of biologically active ribonucleic acid from sources enriched in ribonuclease , Biochemistry 18, p. 5294, 1979 . The lysate was centrifuged for one hour at 20.000 rpm SW 41, Beckmann and the supernatant layered on top of 2 ml CsCl density 1.8 g cm³. After centrifugation for 17 hours at 150.000 g, the RNA pellet was extracted with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. 100 µg total cellular RNA was hybridized for 2.5 hours at 52 C in 65 formamide and 0.4 M NaCl to 16 µg cloned EBV DNA, which was sonicated, denatured and spotted on small nitrocellulose filters. Bound mRNA was eluted by boiling the filters 90 sec in water. The RNA was translated in vitro with a mRNA dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The translation products were immuno precipitated using 5 µl of a pool of human NPC sera for one assay after preincubation with a protein extract from unlabelled EBV negative BJA B cells as previously described G.J. Bayliss, G. Deby, H. Wolf, An immunoprecipitation blocking assay for the analysis of EBV induced antigens , J. Virol. Methods 7, p. 229 1983 . The immune complexes were bound on protein A sepharose, washed, eluted by boiling the beads in electrophoresis sample buffer and loaded onto SDS polyarcrylamid gels. This procedure allowed mapping of a number of viral proteins Fig. 2 relative to the EBV B95 8 genome. The localization of p138, is given in Fig. 2. Using sequence data R. Baer, A.T. Bankier, M.D. Biggin, P.L.Deininger, P.J. Fawell, T. J. Gibson, G. Hatfull, G.S. Hudson, S.C. Satchwell, C. Seguin, P.S. Tuffuel, B. Barrell, DNA sequence and expression of the B95 8 Epstein Barr virus genome , Nature 31o, p. 2o7 1984 , appropriate open reading frames for p138 and p54 were identified Fig. 2 . These open reading frames are completely contained in the right part of the BamA fragment at the right end of the viral genome. According to the sequence data of R. Baer et al., supra , there is a large open reading frame contained in the BamA fragment of EBV B95 8 which is suitable for encoding p138. The nucleotide sequence, the corresponding aminoacid sequence and the respective regulatory elements of the gene of p138 are given in Fig. 3. 50 µg DNA of the plasmid pBR322 BamA J.Skare et al., supra were digested with 50 U XhoI Boehringer for 2 h at 37 C in a total volume of 15o µl containing 15o mM NaCl , 1o mM MgCl₂, 6 mM mercaptoethanol, 6 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.9. 3o µl stop buffer 1o mM Tris HCl, 5o mM EDTA, 6o sucrose, 1 bromphenol blue, pH 7.5 were added, the mixture was put onto a preparative 1 agarose gel in acetate buffer o.o4 M Tris acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.6 , and electrophoresed for 16 h with 4o V at 4 C. As a size marker HindIII digested λ phage DNA Boehringer was used. After staining the gel in Tris acetate buffer with ethidium bromide 0.5 µg ml for 1 h at room temperature RT , the DNA was visualized by UV illumination and the bands corresponding to 3.o and 3.3 kb were excised the 3.o kb XhoI generated fragment is the desired fragment, the 3.3 kb XhoI generated fragment is a partial digest product one XhoI restriction site was not cut . The DNA of the bands was eluted by putting the agarose pieces into dialysis bags, adding 3 volumes of Tris acetate buffer and electrophoresed for 4 h 1oo V, 4 C . Further purification was carried out by a chromatography with Elutip D columns Schleicher Schuell according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer, extraction of the contained ethidium bromide with isoamylalcohol and precipitation of the DNA by adding 2.5 volumes ethanol and incubating overnight at 2o C. The DNA was collected by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor 17.ooo rpm, 2o min and washed with 7o ethanol. After lyophilization the DNA was dissolved in 15 µl TE buffer 1o mM Tris HCL, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 . The DNA concentration of the two isolated fragments was estimated by electrophoresing 1 µl each in parallel with 1oo ng and 1 ug of pUC8 DNA. SalI digested DNA of the vector pUC8 deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen DSM , Göttingen, West Germany, under the accession number DSM 3420 J. Messing, J. Vieira, of double digest restriction fragments , Gene 19, p. 269 1982 was prepared as described before, except that for inhibition of religation of the vector during the following ligase reaction the DNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase o.5 units Boehringer , 3o min at 37 C . In the following, the two purified fragments were each inserted into the cleaved vector SalI and XhoI produce the same cohesive ends, i.e. TGCA . For this purpose for each of the fragments a ligation reaction was carried out with 3oo ng fragment DNA and 1oo ng pUC8 DNA in a total volume of 2o µl ligase buffer 1o mM Tris, 1o mM MgCl₂, 6 mM mercaptoethanol, o.6 mM ATP, pH 7.5 containing 1U T4 DNA ligase Boehringer . After 2o h at 14 C, 80 µl TE buffer and 200 µl competent E.coli JM83 cells ATCC 35607 J. Vieira, J. Messing, The pUC plasmids, an M13mp7 derived system for insertion mutagenesis and sequencing with synthetic universal primers , Gene 19, p. 259 1982 were added. The transformation was done according to the calcium chloride procedure M. Mandel, A. Higa, Calcium dependent bacteriophage DNA infection , J. Mol. Biol. 53, p. 154 197o . Then the cells were mixed with 1.5 ml L broth 5 g yeast extract, 1o g tryptone, 5 g NaCl incubated 1.5 h at 37 C, and finally plated on L broth agar plates 1.5 supplemented with 5o µg ml Ampicillin Sigma and 4o µg ml X gal Boehringer . During this incubation bacteria carrying religated pUC8 molecules yield blue colonies and those which carry recombinant plasmids yield white colonies. For identification of clones that carry the desired recombinant plasmid, twelve white colonies were picked and grown overnight at 37 C in L broth. Aliquots of DNA preparations according to H.C. Birnboim and J. Doly A rapid alkaline extraction procedure for screening recombinant plasmid DNA , Nucl. Acids Res. 7, p. 1513 1979 were digested by BamHI and HindIII and electrophoresed on an agarose gel as described before. Furthermore, for demonstrating the orientation of the integrated fragment, a digest was carried out with BamHI and BglII. Finally the 3.3 kb was checked by a XhoI digest. Plasmid pUC635 carries the 3.0 kb XhoI subfragment of the BamA fragment pBR322 BamA in the proper orientation and the proper reading frame relative to the lac UV5 promoter and is used for the expression of nearly the whole p 138 Fig. 4 . The fusion protein encoded by pUC635 is composed of 12 amino acids of the β galactosidase amino terminus, about 1o2o amino acids of p138, 6o amino acids of the carboxy terminal part of the β galactosidase and another 29 amino acids of a pBR322 encoded region. Plasmid pUC6130 carries the 3.3 kb fragment in the opposite orientation Fig. 4 Since the strain E.coli K12 JM83 is not a β galactosidase repressor overproducer, the fusion protein is constitutively expressed. Therefore the plasmid pUC635 was introduced into the β glactosidase repressor overproducer strain E.coli K12 BMH71 18 DSM 3413 U. Rüther, B.Müller Hill, Easy identification of cDNA clones , EMBO Journal 1o, p. 1791 1983 . Instead of strain E. coli K12 MBH71 18 strain E.coli K12 JM109 DSM 3423 can also be used without essential alteration of the experimental procedure . Besides pUC635 three other plasmids were constructed pUC924, pMF924 and pKK378 Figures 6 to 8 . The insert of pKK378 starts at the same XhoI site and continues up to the third XhoI site located 250bp 3 of the stop codon. This fragment of 3.3kb was generated by an incomplete digest and inserted behind the tac promotor and the start codon of pKK240 11 F.Amann et al., supra . The expression product contains only two bacterial amino acids and its size is smaller then the size of the expression product of pUC635 because the bacterial lacZ part is missing. pUC924 contains the fragment from the Bgl II site to the third Xho I site. puC9 DSM 3421 was used as vector. Since the size of the insert is smaller than in pUC635 and since the stop codon from p138 is used, the molecular weight of the expression product is expected to be smaller than in pUC635 and pKK378. The plasmid pMF924 was constructed from pEA305 E. Amann et al., supra and the same BglII XhoI fragment as in pUC924. pEA305 has a tac promotor followed by the N terminal part of the C1repressor, the resulting fusion protein is expected to be 17kd larger than in pUC924. These constructs were tested for the production of EBV related antigens by inducing the tac and lac promotors with IPTG and separating the proteins on an SDS PAGE. None or only weak new bands could be detected on Coomassie blue stained gels in the regions with the expected sizes. But after a transfer of the proteins onto nitrocellulose and immunostaining with a high titered NPC pool serum and a peroxidase conjugated second anti IgG antibody new EBV specific bands were clearly detectable in all constructs. Fig. 4 All expressed proteins display almost the expected size, but the yield varied over a wide range. The proteins encoded by pUC635 and pMF924, seem to be more stably expressable than the non fusion proteins from pUC924 and pKK378. However, the amount of even the highest expressed protein from pUC635 is too low for a large scale production since in the Coomassie stained gel only a very weak band was visible which may be due to the large size of the eukaryotic protein. The host cells transformed with plasmids pUC635, pUC924, pMF924 and pUK378 were cultivated in L broth supplemented with 50 µg ml Ampicillin to a cell density of D₆₀₀ 0.8. Then, for the induction of the β galactosidase the lactose analogon isopropyl β D thiogalactopyranoside IPTG Sigma was added final concentration 1mM . After a further incubation of 1.5 h at 37 C, 1.5 ml of the culture were centrifuged. The bacteria were resuspended in 2oo µl boiling mix 2 SDS, 5 mercaptoethanol, 3 sucrose, 5o mM Tris HCl, pH 7.o and heated for 1o min at 1oo C. The Western blot was prepared with a current intensity of o.8 A for 3 h in Western blot buffer 72 g glycin, 15 g Tris, 1 l methanol, H₂O dest. ad 5 l . Then the nitrocellulose was saturated with Cohen buffer for 3 h o.1 Ficoll 4oo, 1 polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.6 BSA, o.1 NP4o, o.o5 gelatine, o.17 M H₃BO₃, 28 mM NaOH, 15o mM NaCl, 6 mM NaN₃, pH 8.2 and incubated overnight with 1 5o diluted high titered EBV specific serum from NPC patients. The serum had been preabsorbed to a bacterial protein extract 1 ml 1o⁹ E. coli cells to reduce the bacterial protein generated background. Afterwards unbound IgG was removed by washing the nitrocellulose filter for 5 h in gelatine buffer 5o mM Tris HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 15o mM NaCl, o.25 gelatine, o.5 Triton, o.2 SDS, pH 7.5 . For visualizing the blotted EBV specific proteins rabbit anti human IgG antibodies coupled to peroxidase and diluted 1 200 in TN buffer 154 mM NaCl, 1o mM Tris, pH 7.4 was added. After 2 h at RT, unbound rabbit antibodies were removed by washing with gelatine buffer as described above. Finally the peroxidase reaction was carried out in 1oo ml 5o mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, by adding 5o mg diaminobenzidine Sigma and 4o µl H₂O₂ and incubating 1o min. at RT. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 5. The clone E.coli K12 JM109 pUC 635 was grown at 37 C in 5oo ml L broth supplemented with Ampicillin as described above until the OD Finally 80 mg of the proteins were subjected to a column chromatography Sepharose 2B Cl Pharmacia , length 80 cm, diameter 3 cm with 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris, 0.1 β mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, buffer. 30 µl of each of the collected 4 ml samples were analyzed in a 15 PAGE and the fusion protein containing fractions were pooled. In principle in diagnostic tests only the antigenic determinant subregions of the antigenic protein are needed. Therefore the p138 amino acid sequence was analyzed by a computer programm and the identified subregions of this gene were introduced in suitable vectors. The production of such small proteins has the advantage that these are less vulnerable to rapid changes of antigenicity with decreasing length of the product. Furthermore especially in conjunction with assays for class specific antibodies they will be of diagnostic value. According to the method of P. Chou and G. Fasman Conformational parameters for aminoacids in α helical β sheet and random coil regions calculated from proteins , Biochemistry 13, p. 211 1974 the calculation of the appropriate secondary structure of a protein caused by its aminoacid sequence primary structure is possible. Superimposed on the suggested structure,the program determines the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. Both data sets are combined and a computer graphic is drawn that shows α helical, β sheet, β turning and randomly coiled regions of the secondary structure. Thereby the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are shown as open and closed circles, respectively. An example of such computer graphic is shown for the p138 amino acid sequence in Fig. 9. Based on the assumption that antigenic sites are mainly located in hydrophilic β turns which are located on the surface of the protein, the region between about amino acid 52o and the carboxy terminus of p138 should be antigenic. The corresponding DNA sequence is represented by a PstI fragment of pUC635. Thus pUC635 was cleaved with PstI and all PstI fragments were isolated and introduced into PstI cleaved pUC8, the remaining vector fragment with additional 400 bp up to the first PstI site of the p138 coding sequence was religated all methods as described in example 2 . The resulting recombinant plasmids were designated pUC P400, pUC P380, pUC P600, pUC P210, pUC P750, and pUC P540, respectively. The aminoterminal region of the p138 encoding sequence was cloned by digesting the plasmid pBR322 BamA with PstI and HgiAI and inserting said fragment into PstI cleaved pUC9. J. Messing et al., supra methods as described in example 2 . The resulting recombinant plasmid is designated pUC HP. With the exception of pUC HP in which translation stops at the 3 end of the insertion, in all subclones orientation and reading frames relative to pUC8 are correct. Finally the recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli K12 JM 109 cells. Since pUC subclones example 5 somtimes are not stably expressible in bacteria, because they cannot build up a suitable tertiary structure due to their shortness and therefore can be degraded by proteases to a larger extent than complete proteins we constructed recombinant plasmids encoding large fusion proteins using at least a part of the β galactosidase encoded by pUR288 DSM 3415 U. Rüther et al., supra by cleaving said PstI fragment subclones with BamHI and HindIII, isolating the respective fragments and ligating them into BamHI and HindIII cleaved pUR288 all methods as described in example 2 . The expression was carried out in E.coli K12 JM109. The products were analyzed as described in example 3. After coomassie blue staining of the gel several large fusion proteins of different size were detected, however, after preparation of a Western blot, only the products expressed by pUR6oo and pUR54o showed specific reaction with the IgG antibodies mentioned Fig. 10 . These results are in good agreement with the computer analysis. Additionally the expression of the clones obtained according to example 5 was carried out according to example 3. The products, too, were analyzed as described in example 3. From the coomassie blue stained gel it can be taken that only plasmids pUCP600 and pUCP380 code for a stable fusion protein. The Western blot shows that only pUCP600 derived fusion protein is antigenic Fig. 11 . This fusion protein contains 11 amino acids encoded by the aminoterminal cloning site, a region encoded by about 600 bp of p138 and carboxyterminal amino acids of the lacZ gene. Thus, the recombinant expression plasmids pUR600 and pUR540 as well as pUCP600 can be used for the production of large and small fusion proteins, respectively, containing an antigenic determinant of EBV protein p138. By means of the experiments of example 6 it was shown that the p138 derived protein parts regions are unstable with the exception of the protein encoded by plasmid pUCP600. The second antigenic region from the C terminus of p138 P540, see Fig. 9 is not stably expressible using the recombinant pUC vector pUCP540. For this purpose it was necessary to remove the 5 PstI site of pUCP600 by digesting the plasmid with SstI and HindIII the SstI site is located about 20 bp 3 from the first PstI site . The p138 related SstI HindIII fragment was inserted into SstI HindIII cleaved pUC12 DSM3422 J. Messing, New M13 vectors for cloning , in Methods of Enzymology Vol. 101, Part C., R. Wu, L. Großmann and K. Moldoave eds. , Acad. Press, New York, 1983, 20 78 . Then the resulting recombinant plasmid was digested with EcoRI and PstI. The obtained 600 bp fragment was inserted into plasmid pUC8. The 5 PstI site was now replaced by an SstI site and thus the reading frame is reconstituted at the 3 and the 5 end of the insert Fig. 12a . The resulting recombinant plasmid pUC601 still expresses a stable product Fig. 13 . Between the PstI and HindIII site at the 3 terminus of the EBV encoded sequence a synthetic oligonucleotide obtained according to known methods coding in frame for 5 arginine and 2 stop codons was inserted as shown in Fig. 12b . The resulting plasmid pUCARG601 encodes the P600 region of p138 fused at its C terminus to 5 arginine residues. In a last step the PstI fragment encoding the P540 region of p138 was ligated to the PstI fragment encoding the P600 region of p138 after digestion with PstI. The resulting recombinant plasmid pUCARG1140 encodes a stable protein of about 43kd which contains two antigenic sites of p138 fused in frame. In this fusion protein the protein region P600 stabilizes the protein region P540 Fig. 13 . The arginine residues at the carboxyterminus of the expression product may be used for the purification of the resulting fusion protein as described by Sassenfeld and Brewer supra Fig. 16 . From the plasmid pUCARG1140 a modified version was constructed which lacks 435bp of the p138 encoding region, the C terminal part of the p600 fragment and the N terminal part of the p540 fragment. The main antigenic sites predicted by the computer program are still present. The plasmid was designated as pUCARG680 and its construction was achieved by digesting pUCARG1140 with NcoI cleavage site coresp onds to bp1841 and bp3243 in Fig. 3 . Since the reading frames in the p600 NcoI site and the p540 NcoI site do not fit, the sticky ends were removed with S1 Nuclease. Immunoblots with the fusion proteins encoded by the recombinant plasmids pUCARG1140, pUR540, and pUR600 examples 6 and 7 using individual NPC sera reveal that the immunological reactions differ in various patients Fig. 14 . In this context it has to be understood that said plasmids encode fusion proteins containing the p138 regions P540 P600, P540, and P600, respectively see Fig. 9 . Whereas in NPC serum no.352 the main fraction of the IgG and IgA antibodies is directed to the P540 region, the main fraction in NPC serum no.354 is directed to the P600 region of p138. A representative pool prepared from many sera from NPC patients did not detect additional antigenic sites. The conclusion from this finding is that the antigenic determinants P540 and P600 as encoded by the recombinant plasmids of the present invention are necessary and sufficient to achieve the desired specificity for ELISA tests useful for diagnostic purposes. The purified fusion protein encoded by pUCARG1140 was coated on micro titer plates. Ten individual NPC sera were tested for their IgG and especially for their IgA reactivity. The IgA anti EA titer of these sera was previously determined in conventional immunofluorescence tests. The highest titer found was 1 80. In the ELISA test shown in Fig. 15, two EBV negative, one NPC serum pool and ten individual NPC sera were tested up to a dilution 1 10640. The test was performed according to the usual ELISA protocol. Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase conjugated mouse anti human IgG, i.e. IgA and peroxidase reaction. All NPC sera show a reaction with the coated antigen up to 1 2560 in IgA and no background reaction could be observed in the negative controls. This result indicates that the pUCARG1140 encoded expression product is suitable for the diagnosis and early detection of NPC. The coding region of gp 250 and gp 350 was mapped to the Bam L fragment J. Skare et al., supra of the EBV B95 8 genome. As both polypeptides share identical regions it was supposed that both proteins are encoded by overlapping reading frames M. Hummel, D. Thorley Lawson, E. Kieff, Epstein Barr virus DNA fragment encodes messages for the two major envelope glycoproteins gp 350 300 and gp 220 200 , J. of Virol. 49, p. 413 1984 . The sequence data of Baer et al. supra revealed a large open reading frame including a donor splice site and an acceptor splice site in said Bam L fragment of the virus genome Fig.17 and 18 . It is assumed that gp 350 is the translation product of the unspliced mRNA transcribed from this region and gp 250 is a product of the corresponding spliced mRNA Fig.17 . Since both products are found in the viral capsids it is assumed that a differential splicing of said mRNA in a manner comparable with the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes T. Honjo, Immunoglobulin genes , Ann. Rev. of Immunol.1, p. 499 1983 takes place. During this splicing 630 bp of the mRNA coding for gp 350 are removed to yield the gp 250 coding mRNA Fig. 17 and 27 dotted lines R. Baer et al., supra . Therefore the whole or a part of the reading frame of gp 350 was cloned for finally isolating and producing a gp 350 related product. It should be kept in mind, that not only gp 250 but also gp 350 are highly glycosylated proteins. In contrast, the proteins produced by expression of the recombinant DNA molecules according to the present invention differ from the respective viral proteins normally occuring in nature. If expression is carried out in prokaryotes unmodified proteins are obtained whereas expression in eukaryotes gives proteins with different patterns of glycosylation or else modifications as compared to the natural product. The Bam L fragment was introduced in pBR322, and E. coli K 12 HB 101 was transformed with the recombinant plasmid obtained. J. Skare, et al., supra The contents of the publications of M. Hummel et al. supra , J. R. North et al. J. R. North, A. J. Morgan, J. L. Thompson, M. A. Epstein, Purified Epstein Barr virus M As shown in Fig.17, a 1.9 kb PstI PstI fragment of the Bam L fragment Hummel et al., supra contains the part of the gp 350 coding region beginning at aminoacid position 232 and ending at aminoacid position 825. A large scale preparation of the pBR 322 BamL plasmid DNA was done according to the method published by H.C. Birnboim and J. Doly A rapid alkaline extraction procedure for screening recombinant plasmid DNA , Nucl. Acids Res. 7, p. 1513 1979 . 50µg of this DNA were digested for 2 hours at 37 C with 100 units PstI Boehringer in 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5. The digestion was stopped by addition of 1 5 vol. 50 mM EDTA, 60 sucrose, 2 bromphenolblue. The resulting solution was electrophoretically separated on a 1 agarose gel Seakem, FMC in Tris acetate buffer 0.04 M Tris acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.6 . As a size marker HindIII digested λ phage DNA Boehringer was used. After the electrophoresis at 40 V for 14 hours at room temperature RT , the gel was stained in Tris acetate buffer containing 0.5 µg ml ethidium bromide. The DNA bands in the gel were visualized by UV illumination and the 1.9 kb PstI PstI fragment was isolated as described in example 2. PstI digested DNA of the vector pUC8 was prepared as described before, except that for inhibition of religation of the vector during the following ligase reaction, the DNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase 0.5 units Boehringer , 30 min at 37 C . The concentration of the purified fragments was estimated by electrophoresing 1 µl each in parallel with 100 ng and 500 ng of pUC8 DNA under conditions described above . 400ng of the 1.9 kb PstI PstI fragment and 100 ng of the PstI digested vector DNA were ligated, E.coli K12 JM109 was transformed with the ligated plasmid DNA and positive clones were identified as described in example 2. The obtained clone was designated E. coli K12 JM109 pUCLP1.9 and the resulting recombinant plasmid pUCLP1.9, respectively. For the expression of a stable product of the gp 350 subregion said 1.9 kb PstI PstI fragment was reclon in the vector pUR290 DSM 3417 Fig. 20 U.Rüther et al., infra . The resulting recombinant plasmid is coding for a fusion protein of an aminoterminal region of the β galactosidase, followed by the aminoacids 232 to 825 of gp 350 and aminoacids coded by the cloning site of pUR290 and pBR322 nucleotide residues. The respective aminoacid sequence is given in figure 21. 50 µg DNA of the plasmid pUCLP 1.9 were digested with 100 units BamHI and HindIII and separated on a 1 agarose gel as described above. The resulting 1.9 kb BamHI HindIII fragment that contains only a few more nucleotides than the PstI PstI fragment originally introduced into pUC8 was separated from the other resulting fragments on a 1 agarose gel as described above . Finally it was isolated from the gel as described above and ligated into BamHI HindIII digested DNA of the vector pUR290 U. Rüther, B. Müller Hill Easy identification of cDNA clones , EMBO Journal 1o, p. 1791 1983 according to the methods described above. The next step was the transformation of the β galactosidase repressor protein overproducer strain E. coli K12 JM109 with these recombinant DNA molecules. The transformants were plated and analysed as described above, except that the aliquots of the DNA preparations were digested with BamHI HindIII and EcoRI. The resulting clone, E.coli K12 JM109 pURLP1.9 carries the plasmid pURLP1.9, that is a recombinant of said BamHI HindIII 1.9 kb fragment of the plasmid pUCLP1.9 and the vector pUR290 see Fig. 20 . In an overnight culture E. coli K12 JM109 pURLP1.9 was grown at 37 C in 5ml L broth supplemented with 50 µg ml Ampicillin. The culture was then diluted to an optical density at 560 nm OD₅₆₀ of 0.4, and 4 ml of this bacteria suspension were incubated at 37 C until an OD₅₆₀ of 0.8. The expression of the genetic information carried by plasmid pURLP1.9 was then induced as described in example 3 and finally the proteins were visualized by coomassie blue staining as described in example 3. In comparison with the control experiment, several new proteins, encoded by the plasmid pURLP1.9 and ranging in size from 116 kD to 200 kD, were detected Fig. 22 . The different size of the expression products may be due to incomplete mRNA synthesis or translation. To prove that the new proteins are EBV related products, all the electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, i.e. a Western blot was prepared according to the method described in example 3. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 22. The replacement of the natural carboxyterminal amino acid sequence of the β galactosidase by a gp 350 related amino acid sequence prevents the formation of β galactosidase tetramers. Furthermore the newly expressed fusion protein is present in a high concentration in the bacterial cell. Therefore the fusion protein precipitates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. According to the method described in example 4 the clone E. coli K12 JM109 pURLP1.9 was used for the production of the corresponding fusion protein. The results of the several stages of this purification procedure are shown in Fig. 23. Fig. 24 shows the computer predicted secondary structure of gp350 together with the relative values of hydrophilic dark circles and hydrophobic grey circles areas. β turns or loop structures are indicated as line turns of 180 α helices, β sheet and coil structures are barely discernable in the scale used . Based on the assumption that antigenic sites are mainly located in β turns in an hydrophilic environment, which may be exposes to the surface of the protein, the regions at about aminoacid 50 and aminoacid 740 and 800 830, respectively, are expected to represent antigenic epitopes. The EBV BamHI L fragment which was cloned in pBR322 see J. Skare et al., supra was digested with EcoRI restriction sites at positions 650 and 1284 in the sequence given in Fig. 17 , the resulting 634 bp fragment was eluted from an agarose gel after electrophoresis and ligated to EcoRI linearised pUC19 DSM3425 Yanisch Perron et al. Gene 33, 103 119 1985 . Then, E.coli K12 JM109 was transformed with the ligation products all steps were carried out as described in Example 2 . According to example 2 the recombinant plasmids obtained were tested for the orientation of their insert using suitable restriction enzymes. A recombinant plasmid carrying the insert in the opposite orientation of the reading frame relative to the reading frame of the lacZ gene of the pUC19 plasmid was designated as pUC19LEP600 and used for further cloning pUC19LEP600 was digested with BamHI and PstI the BamHI site is derived from pUC19, the PstI site corresponds to position 1248 in Fig. 17 , the resulting 600bp fragment was inserted into pUR291 DSM3418 Rüther, supra , previously digested with BamHI and PstI. The resulting recombinant plasmid pURLEP600 displayed the following sequence in its linker region at the C terminus of the β galactosidase The expression of the fusion protein from this recombinant plasmid after IPTG induction was carried out as described in example 3. The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 25. From Fig. 25 lower part it can be taken that the expression product obtained is recognized as a moderately antigenic protein by a pool of NPC sera. The region covering the antigenic epitopes near the C terminus which, according to the computer directed analysis, also is expected to be antigenic, was isolated by digesting the plasmid pUCLP1.9 see example 11 with XmnI restriction site at position 2760 in Fig. 17 and HindIII restriction site in the region derived from the pUC plasmid . The purified 386 bp fragment was inserted into pUC19 previously digested with HincII and HindIII. The resulting plasmid which was introduced into E.coli K12 JM109 is pUC19LXP390 The insert of pUC19LXP390 was cut out with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pUR288 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting recombinant plasmid was introduced into E.coli K12 JM109 and was designated as pURLXP390. The sequence in its linker region is as follows After IPTG induction a β galactosidase fusion protein was synthesized by said transformed host. In a Western blot the expression product shows a high reactivity with the NPC sera pool see Fig. 25, lower part . Jilg et al. W.Jilg and H. Wolf, Diagnostic Significance of Antibodies to the Epstein Barr Virus Specific Membrane Antigen gp250 , The Journal of Infectious Diseases, IgA antibodies to the membrane protein gp250 350 and to subfragments thereof are absent in the normal population, but present in 58 of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma patients when measured in a relatively insensitive immunofluorescence assay. These results are similar to the detection rate of IgA antibodies to EBV specific early antigens in comparable testsystems. In analogy the more sensitive ELISA test brings the detection rate close to 100 with only minimal increase of false positive results. Therefore the antigens encoded by the newly constructed recombinant plasmids pURLEP600, pURLXP390, and pURLP1.9, respectively, are valuable substances for the initial diagnosis and the control of a therapy of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. The recombinant plasmid covering the N terminal region of gp250 350, pUC19LEP600 see example 15 , was digested with BamHI and PstI. The EBV derived fragment was isolated and ligated into pUC8, previously digested with the same enzymes. The sequence in the linker region of the resulting clone, pUCLEP600, is the following After induction with IPTG, the fusion protein encoded by pUCLEP600 is quite stable in the bacterial cells and is recognized as an antigen by the NPC sera pool see Fig. 26 . The bacterial fusion part consists of 14 aminoacids at the N terminus and 9 at the C terminus. The value of this protein is its applicability in a vaccine, especially when it is fused with the per se instable second antigenic region from the C terminus as it was determined with the β gal fusion proteins see example 15 . The inserts of the recombinant expression plasmids and cloning plasmids constructed according to examples 11 and 15 to 17 are summarized in Fig. 27. The plasmid pUC19LEP600 see example 15 was digested with PstI and the resulting 600bp fragment was ligated to the PstI linearised plasmid pUCARG601 see example 7 . The gp350 insert was checked to be in the same orientation as the pUCARG601 reading frame and the resulting recombinant plasmid was designated as pUCARG1230. The sequence in the linker region and at the junction sites of the obtained plasmids is the following After induction with IPTG, E.coli K12 JM109 carrying pUCARG1230 expresses a stable and antigenic protein which consists of antigenic regions from two different proteins, namely p138 and gp250 350 see Fig. 26 . Furthermore it can be used as antigen in ELISA tests and also for vaccination. Supernatants from B95 8 cells were used to immortalize human umbilical cord blood cells Lymphocyte fraction from Ficol Hypaque gradient . 0,5 x 10⁶ lymphocytes were seeded per 0,5 ml microtiter plate well and 50 µl of a cell free supernatant of B95 8 cells were added and allowed to adsorb for 2 hours at 37 C. After incubation the virus containing medium was removed, cells were washed with RPMI1640 medium containing 10 fetal calf serum and incubated in 200 µl of the same medium at 37 C in a 5 CO₂ atmosphere. Developing colonies of lymphoblastoid cells were evaluated not sooner than three weeks after the start of the experiment and counted as positive transformation. The neutralizing properties of sera were tested by preincubating for 1 hour under slight agitation aliquotes of the Epstein Barr Virus containing B95 8 cell supernatant with 20 µl of test serum including the respective preimmunization serum as control in a replicate test before the supernatant was allowed to adsorb to the umbilical cord blood lymphocytes. After removing the inoculum from the cells after 2 hours the maintenance medium RPMI1640 supplemented with 10 FCS was supplemented with 5 of the respective sera under test for neutralizing activity. The following results were obtained The coding sequence of the diagnostically relevant protein p 150 Virus capsid antigen VCA see Example 1, Fig. 28D was examined for antigenic sites and subcloned for the expression as β galactosidase fusion proteins. The N terminal region which is expected to encode an antigenic site was obtained by digestion of the Charon 4A phage EB 69 79 G.N. Buell, D. Reisman, C. Kintner, G. Crouse, and B. Sugden, Cloning overlapping DNA fragments from the B95 8 strain of Epstein Barr virus ATCC CRL 1612 reveals a site of homology to the internal repetition , Journal of Virology 40, 977 982 1981 with BamHI and a resulting 1176bp fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pUC12. From a resulting plasmid with the insertion in the proper orientation a 580bp fragment was excised with XhoI SalI. The SalI site derives from the pUC12 linker, the XhoI site is located 33bp upstream from the start of p150. This fragment was inserted into pUC8 digested with SalI SalI and XhoI share the same sticky end sequence . The resulting clones were screened to have the p150 start codon next to the BamHI site. From a proper clone the p150 encoding region was cut out with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pUR290 digested with BamHI and HindIII pUR290CXH580 . The expression of the β Gal p150 fusion protein from this clone is shown in Figure 29. Its ability to react very well with a NPC serum pool can be taken from Figure 30. Further, p150 β gal fusion contructs were obtained accordingly. For example the subclones From Figure 30 the restriction enzyme sites used for subcloning can also be taken. All clones with the exception of pURDBB180 were constructed by subcloning the desired fragments into pUC8 or pUC12 see supra to obtain BamHI and HindIII sites suitable for the cloning to pUR vectors see supra . pUR292DBB180 was derived by insertion of the 180bp BglII BglII fragment see Fig.31 into pUR292 linearized with BamHI. Figures 29 and 30 show their expression and antigenicity. The following deposited plasmids, host bacteria and cell lines were used for the purpose of the present invention. While we have hereinbefore presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our constructions can be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize DNA sequences of the EBV genome coding for EBV related antigens and for producing recombinant DNA molecules. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that other DNA sequences may also be used, which are related to said DNA sequences and which may be derived from other EBV serotypes. The EBV is easily obtainable from known natural sources, e. g. from the saliva of infected patients. It is obvious that for obtaining biologically comparable results other suitable vector hose systems can be used. The invention ist not limited to host vector systems presently available.
