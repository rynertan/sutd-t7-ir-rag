# Process for the preparation of the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid by the reaction of acetone with methyl acrylate. The reactants are reacted in a reaction zone in the presence of both a primary amine and or Schiff base as catalyst, and an acid compound to form a reaction mixture containing the methyl ester. The reaction mixture is distilled to form a distillate containing unconsumed reactants and catalyst and a residual liquid phase containing the methyl ester. The distillate is recycled to the reaction zone, and the methyl ester is recovered from the residual liquid phase by a further distillation. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the reaction mixture is maintained at a level below 20 parts by weight per million, and the distillation of the reaction mixture is carried out at a temperature of less than 195 C, at a pressure of at least atmospheric, and in the presence of an inert solvent having a boiling point of between 80 and 195 C.

## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE METHYL ESTER OF 4 OXOPENTANE 1 CARBOXYLIC ACID The invention relates to a process of preparing the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid by the liquid phase reaction of acetone with methyl acrylate by means of a primary amine and orSchiff base as a catalyst and in the presence of an acid compound. According to this process, which is known from BritishPatent Specification 1,389,510, the reaction mixture obtained upon completion of said reaction is subjected to a first distillation at atmospheric pressure, to remove overhead unconsumed reactants and catalyst. The distillate containing the catalyst and the unconsumed reactants can be re used in the preparation of a further methyl ester, while the residue remaining from the said distillation and containing the methyl ester is subjected to a further distillation at reduced pressure whereby the methyl ester product is recovered in a substantially pure state. In the said known process it was found that the yield of methyl ester could be adversely affected if the catalyst and the unconsumed reactants are distilled off at a temperature higher than 0 195 C, which occurs when atmospheric pressure is used. However the use of reduced pressure to keep the temperature of the reaction 0 mixture below 195 C results in a polymeric substance depositing onto the wall of the reactor and stirrer used when the resulting distillate is recycled to the reaction mixture, which substance impeded continuous operation of the process. By the practice of the present invention both the adverse effect on the yield and the abovementioned deposit of a polymeric substance is inhibited. The process according to the invention for preparing the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane l carboxylic acid by the liquid phase reaction of acetone with methyl acrylate by means of a primary amine and or Schiff base as a catalyst and in the presence of an acid compound, in which the unconsumed reactants and the catalyst are first distilled from the resulting reaction mixture and said methyl ester is recovered from tl remaining residue by a further distillation, is characterized in that the amount of oxygen dissolved in the reaction mixture is maintained at a level below 20 parts by weight per million and the unconsumed reactants and the catalyst are distilled off at a temperature below 195 OC and a pressure not lower than atmospheric in the presence of an inert solvent with a boiling point of between 0 80 and 195 C. Examples of suitable inert solvents are mesityl oxide, mesitylene, toluene, xylenes, decalin, dioxane and cumene. The temperature of the first distillation may be controlled by the amount of inert solvent used. Thus the minimum amount of inert solvent to be added to the reaction mixture when the unconsumed reactants and the catalyst are distilled off is that amount at which the temperature of 195 OC in distillation at atmospheric pressure is just not exceeded.If more than said minimum amount of inert solvent is used, this may lower the maximum temperature during distillation to for example 180 OC. The addition of such an amount that said maximum temperature is reduced further than 160 OC offers no practical advantage. After the unconsumed reactants and the catalyst have been distilled off, the inert solvent can be recovered from the remaining residue by a distillation. The inert solvent used is preferably mesityl oxide, since it is formed as a by product in the process according to the invention by condensation of acetone to diacetone alcohol and subsequent elimination of water, and thus has to be removed in the distillation of the residue that remains upon removal of the unconsumed reactants and the catalyst by distillation and from which the methyl ester is recovered. The mesityl oxide obtained in said further distillation of the residue is substantially pure and is suitable as such for use as the inert solvent. The distillation of the residue to recover the inert solvent and the methyl ester can be effected at reduced pressure without difficulty. The required low oxygen content of the reaction mixture can be achieved by passing an inert gas e.g. nitrogen through the reaction mixture and or the reactants to be fed in or by heating the reactants to be added to the boilingtemperature of the reactant in question. In the process according to the invention various primary amines and or Schiff bases may be used as the catalyst, e.g., methyl amine, ethyl amine, n propyl amine, isopropyl amine, n butyl amine, isobutyl amine, secondary pentyl amine and or the Schiff bases of these amines with acetone. In practice amount of catalyst may be in the range from 0.01 to 0.25 mole of catalyst per mole of methyl acrylate to be converted. In addition to the catalyst, a small amount of an acid or acid compound must be present in the reaction mixture. An amount of between about 0.01 0.5 moles of acid compound per mole of catalyst, for example, would be sufficient. Either organic and inorganic acids are suitable for this purpose, e.g., acetic acid, benzoic acid, adipic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid and sulphuric acid. The amount of acetone used in the process according may be for example from 2 to 15 moles of acetone per mole of methyl acrylate.Larger proportions e.g. 20 moles per mole of methyl acrylate may be used if desired, butt little if any practical advantage is thereby attained. The temperature at which the reaction of acetone with the methyl acrylate is effected may be for example between 750 and 230 OC. The pressure is not critical but should be sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in the liquid phase. The invention will be elucidated in the following example of a continuous type reaction.Example Into a stainless steel 6 litre reactor provided with a stirrer, there was introduced per hour 316 grams of acetone, 479 grams of methyl acrylate, 32 grams of a catalyst mixture comprising 31.0 by weight of isopropyl amine, 8.4 by weight of benzoic acid and 60.6 by weight of acetone, and 2343 grams of a recycling mixture obtained as described below and consisting of 0.1 by weight of isopropyl amine, 88.5 by weight of acetone, 9.6 by weight of methyl acrylate, and 1.8 Olo by weight of isopropylidene isopropyl amine. The reaction mixture is passed successively through two other reactors of the same type. The reaction mixture in the reactors is kept under a nitrogen pressure of about 2000 kPa, while the temperature of the reaction 0 mixture is controlled at about 180 C by heating the reactors. The oxygen content of the acetone used is lowered from 50 p.p.m. to 1.5 p.p.m. by passing through nitrogen that is substantially free of oxygen. In the reactors, the oxygen content of the reaction mixture is about 2 p.p.m. After the reaction mixture has passed the last reactor, it is expanded to atmospheric pressure. 3169 grams of reaction mixture are obtained per hour. The reaction mixture contains 19.5 by weight of the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid, 7.1 by weight of methyl acrylate, and 65.4 by weight of acetone. The conversion of the methyl acrylate amounts to 68 and that of the acetone to 14 . The yield of methyl ester of 4 oxopentane l carboxylic acid is 77 0 calculated to converted methyl acrylate and 74 calculated to converted acetone. The resulting reaction mixture is then fed to a distillation column into which has previously been introduced sufficient of the inert solvent mesityl oxide that the total amount of mesityl oxide in the resulting mixture is about 20 by weight of the amount of methyl ester. The distillation is effected in a thermally insulated sievetray column with an internal diameter of 5 centimeters built up of 25 sieve trays and provided with a reflux cooler, a liquid reflux distributor and a recycle evaporator. The column is fed continuously with 3231 g h of mixture at the eleventh tray from the top. The top 0 pressure is atmospheric, the bottom temperature is 190 C and the reflux ratio is 0.5. The distillate 2358 g h contains 0.1 by weight of isopropyl amine, 87.9 by weight of acetone, 9.6 by weight of methyl acrylate, 1.8. by weight of isopropylideneisopropylamine, and 0.7 by weight of water and is recycled.To prevent accumulation of water in the reactors upon recirculation of the distillate, the reaction water formed by reaction of isopropyl amine with acetone to form isopropylidene isopropylaniine is removed by molecular sieves. The bottom product 873 g h of the distillation column consists of 14.2 70 by weight of mesityl oxide, 70.8 by weight of the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid and 15 ,0 by weight of residue. This bottom product is fed to a second continuously operated distillation column of the same type as the first except that the feed is at the sixteenth tray from the top, and the column is operated at 0 reduced pressure top pressure 20 kPa, bottom temperature 160 C . The reflux ratio is 1 to 2. The distillate 124 g h of this column is substantially pure mesityl oxide. Part of it 50 by weight is recycled to the first distillation column. The bottom product 749 g h , consists mainly of the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid 618 g h and residue 131 g h .This bottom product is fed to a third distillation column of the same type as the first. The column is operated continuously with the feed at the twenty first tray from the top, a reflux ratio of 3, a top 0 pressure of 2.6 kPa and a bottom temperature of between 215 and 220 C.The distillate 616 g h is the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid with a purity of 97 . The bottom product contains 10 to 20 O by weight of the methyl ester of 4 oxopentane 1 carboxylic acid in addition to residue.
