# Improved method of removing lipid inhibitors from lumulus amebocyte lysate.

## Abstract
The improved method of the present invention involves the removal of lipid inhibitors from Limulus amebocyte lysate to increase the sensitivity and quality of the lysate. The method comprises intimately contacting, as by mixing and stirring, ti mulus amebocyte lysate with a selected binary liquid solvent system for a time sufficient to draw water into the solvent sys tem from the lysate and to effectively extract and denature the lipid inhibitors in the lysate. The ability of the binary solvent to draw in water from the lysate and form, in effect, a new tertiary system is the important factor in this methodology. The amount of water drawn into the solvent is controlled by the amount of polar solvent in the solvent system. After this ex traction and denaturation, the lysate is then separated from the solvent system and recovered in purified form of increased sensitivity. After this extraction and denaturation, the lysate is then separated from the solvent system and recovered in puri fied form of increased sensitivity.
