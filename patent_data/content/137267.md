# Thin film magnetic transducer head.

## Abstract
A thin film type magnetic transducer head comprises a magnetic substrate 1 , and a thin film magnetic core 5 formed on the substrate through an effective magnetic gap g at one end of the substrate 1 facing to a magnetic recording medium, the magnetic substrate 1 and the thin film magnetic core 5 forming a magnetic circuit for reproducing of signals on the magnetic medium, wherein a length b between a center of the magnetic gap g and an edge of the magnetic core and a wave length Î»
