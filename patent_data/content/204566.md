## Description
The present invention relates to a vaccine for control of fertility and in particular to a polyvalent vaccine having a multiplicity of determinant antigens in the reproductive system linked to at least one, and preferably more than one, carrier. The present invention is directed to an active immunological approach for control of fertility by antibodies intercepting the action of one or more gonadotropins. The pituitary luteinizing hormone LH and chorionic gonadotropin CG exercise a critical role in the regulation of fertility in primates. The former is important for ovulation and steroidogenesis, the latter for rescue of corpus luteum and maintenance of steroidogenesis up to the time of placental shift. Human chorionic gonadotropin hCG is an early product of trophoblast and is recognized to be essential for the establishment and sustenance of pregnancy. Both active and passive immunological approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in primates for control of fertility. Use was made in such immunizations of Freunds Complete Adjuvant C.F.A. which is unacceptable for eventual human use. The present invention concerns an active polyvalent vaccine which can induce the formation of antibodies in primates effective against both gonadotropins without the use of C.F.A. The vaccine of the present invention leads to the formation of antibodies capable of reacting with the complete hCG molecule consisting of both α and β subunits to produce neutralization of its biological activity as well as diminish, to an extent, the bioactivity of LH. The vaccine produces antibodies devoid of cross reactivity with body tissues and the antibody response is of controlled and reasonably long duration, providing an immunity which is reversible, free from toxicity and contra indications to body functions and also does not cause extra hypersensitivity problems. The anti hCG immunization approach of the present invention is known from earlier work and in particular from the inventor s earlier Canadian Patent No. 1,054,937, issued May 22, 1979 and also Canadian Patent No. 1,057,742 Stevens issued July 3, 1979. However, these two investigators of anti hCG vaccines have used fundamentally different approaches. The present inventor has used the β subunit of the hormone hCG, while Stevens has used the 37 amino acid carboxy terminal peptide CTP of the same sub unit. The modes by which this self protein is rendered immunogenic are also different. The present inventor has utilized a carrier, such as tetanus toxoid, whereas Stevens and co workers initially advocated haptenic modification of the protein although they subsequently opted for the carrier approach. hCG is a glycoproteinic hormone composed of two subunits, α and β. The α subunit is common to three other pituitary hormones, TSH, LH, and FSH. It is the β subunit which confers in each case the hormonal individuality to these hormones. Thus, the use of only the β subunit of hCG as antigen reduces the chances that the antibodies will cross react with the other glycoprotein hormones, in particular TSH and FSH. While the female immune system is normally tolerant to hCG and would not be expected to produce antibodies following injection of the hormone, immunogenicity can be introduced by modifying the molecule either by attaching haptenic groups or by linking it to an immunogenic carrier protein. Thus, in aforementioned Canadian Patent No. 1,054,937 immunization is effected using a vaccine in which β hCG is chemically linked to tetanus toxoid. This vaccine produces antibodies against both the pregnancy hormone hCG as well as tetanus toxoid. However, the efficacy of the vaccine is not adequate for some low responder subjects whose antibody response is too low to prevent pregnancy. The marked variation constitutional variations in response among subjects indicates a need to modify the vaccine so that adequate antibody response is elicited in the majority, if not all, of recipients. The present invention attempts to provide an improved immunogen for eliciting substantially higher anti hCG antibodies in mammalian species, as compared to the β hCG TT vaccine. The use of more than one carrier is further proposed to evoke good antibody response in low responders to a given carrier. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a polyvalent vaccine which comprises the steps of a obtaining at least two separate antigens of the reproductive system, a first being a preparation of β subunit of hCG and a second being a preparation of a sperm antigen or a heterospecies α or β subunit of LH, b obtaining a pure preparation of at least one subject compatible carrier, c conjugating said at least two antigens of step a with said at least one carrier of step b by carrying out at least one step selected from the group consisting of i forming a composite conjugate of said at least two separate antigens linked to the same carrier, ii forming a physical mixture of conjugates of said at least two separate antigens each separately linked to a said carrier, iii associating said at least two separate antigens which are β subunit of hCG and a said hetero α subunit to form an annealed composite which is then conjugated with a said carrier, and, where more than one carrier is present, iv forming a polyvalent conjugate of at least one antigen linked both to at least one sperm antigen and to at least one carrier, and, v forming a conjugate of one of said antigens linked to a said carrier, and, if necessary, d combining two or more conjugate products from steps i to v above. In another aspect the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a polyvalent vaccine using more than one carrier for a mammalian subject having a low antibody response to a single carrier conjugate vaccine which comprises the steps of a obtaining at least two separate antigens of the reproductive system, a first being a preparation of β subunit hCG and a second being a preparation of a sperm antigen or heterospecies α or β subunit of LH, b obtaining a pure preparation of at least two subject compatible carriers, c conjugating said at least two antigens of step a with at least one of said at least two carriers of step b by carrying out at least one step selected from the group consisting of i forming a composite conjugate of said at least two separate antigens linked to the same carrier, ii forming a physical mixture of conjugates of said at least two separate antigens separately linked to at least one of said carriers, iii associating said at least two separate antigens which are β subunit of hCG and a said hetero α subunit of LH to form an annealed composite which is then conjugated with at least one of said carriers, iv forming a polyvalent conjugate of at least one antigen linked both to at least one sperm antigen and to at least one carrier, and, v forming a conjugate of one of said antigens linked to a said carrier, and, if necessary, d combining two or more conjugate products from steps i to v above. In another aspect the present invention provides a polyvalent vaccine which comprises at least two hormone antigens of the reproductive system with the proviso that in the case of homospecies antigens the antigens are specific to the reproductive system, and at least one subject compatible carrier, said polyvalent vaccine being selected from the group consisting of i a composite conjugate of at least two separate antigens linked to the same carrier moiety ii a mixture of conjugates of at least two separate antigens each separately linked to at least one carrier iii an annealed composite of at least two separate antigens which are β subunit of hCG and a heterospecies α subunit conjugated to a carrier, iv a polyvalent conjugate of at least one antigen linked to sperm antigen and to at least one carrier, and, v a mixture of at least two of i to iv . In another aspect the present invention provides a method of birth control employing the polyvalent vaccine which comprises administering said vaccine to a female mammal at a dose and frequency sufficient to prevent pregnancy. Thus, in the present invention increased immunogenicity is achieved, and the constitutional variation or low responder problem is tackled by the provision of a polyvalent vaccine consisting of more than one antigen of the reproductive system linked to more than one carrier which seeks interception or neutralization in more than one manner within the reproductive system. The novel conjugates are formed with at least two antigens linked to more than one carrier s , one of the antigens being β hCG. The new vaccine formed from these novel conjugates can be defined as having a multi valent capability against the reproductive system and a large capability of inducing good antibody response from genetically different individuals. In one of the preferred embodiments, the β subunit of hCG is annealed to a heterospecies α subunit, such as α oLH, and this helps to achieve the optimal configuration for hormonal activity thereby offering the possibility of producing antibodies which recognize that configuration and prevent hormone interaction with the tissue receptors. It is important to use the α subunit of a heterospecies since the α subunit of hCG is common to three other hormones hTSH, hFSH and hLH. Cross reaction with hTSH and hFSH is contra indicated and hence one cannot use the homologous α subunit human for achieving an optimal conformation of hCG for bioactivity. The α subunit, for example from ovine LH, can anneal with β hCG to generate a the optimal confirmation, b increased immunogenicity, c with the further advantage that no cross reaction is produced with hTSH and hFSH. The β subunit of hCG is included in the polyvalent vaccine of the present invention together with a sperm antigen and or a heterospecies β subunit of LH to provide the multiplicity of antigenic determinant so that diverse antibodies are formed to intercept fertility at more than one point. These epitopes can be present in the novel polyvalent vaccine by way of a mixed conjugate in which they are both attached to the same carrier thus forming a mixed conjugate , or can be separately attached to different molecules of the same carrier or indeed different carriers thereby creating a physical mixture of different conjugates. As a further alternative, the two antigens can be conjugated to the carrier. With the annealed composite embodiment a heterospecies α subunit is associated with β hCG. The α subunit may be equine, porcine, ovine, rodent or other hetero mammalian species, other than man. With the mixed conjugate and physical mixture of different conjugate embodiments, the β subunit of a heterospecies is bonded to β hCG. Preferably the β subunit of luteinizing hormone LH of a heterospecies such as equine, porcine, ovine or rodent is used, and more preferably the β subunit of ovine LH. These novel conjugates appear to produce principally LH interaction and secondly counteract CG, while the annealed composite conjugate appears to principally counteract CG while interfering less with LH. The annealed composite can replace β hCG in the mixed conjugate and physical mixture of conjugate embodiments thereby providing a vaccine with increased efficacy. In addition, more than two antigens can be included in the vaccine in order to boost the effect of multiplicity of determinant action in the reproductive system. Thus, a sperm antigen, such as LDHC₄, can be included to counteract sperm and thus prevent conception. It has also been surprisingly discovered, in accordance with the present invention, that the use of a second or more carriers in the polyvalent vaccine produces increased efficacy, this being particularly useful in overcoming the low response to a given carrier as a result of constitutional variation. The use of more than one carrier also has the distinctive advantage of producing immunoprophylactic benefit against more than one health hazard. Particular embodiments of the present invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which All the conjugation methods mentioned above can be used for preparing conjugates of the hormone subunit with the carrier. However, the preferred methods are given below with experimental details. The conjugates obtained by this method when run on S 300 column 85x2.5cm show similar protein profiles when made at different time points and have immunologically same amount of ingredients present. α oLH and β hCG are mixed in a ratio of 2 1 in sodium acetate buffer 0.5M, pH 6.0 containing 10mM sodium azide. The solution containing the subunits is kept under constant mild agitation at room temperature 25 C for 15 18 hours. To monitor the efficiency of annealing an aliquot 10 µl of the mixture is taken at the start and mixed with 1 ml of 40 µM 8 anilino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid, Magnesium salt ANS and fluorescence measured at the following wavelengths The fluorescence is observed exactly in a similar way taking aliquots at 4 hour intervals until it fails to register any increase. Once the fluorescence has stabilized, maximum annealing has been achieved. The annealed material is then passed over a Sephadex G 75 column and the high molecular weight protein peak collected and checked for gonadotropin activity. The elution buffer used is phosphate buffer 0.2M, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 M sodium chloride. Conjugation of the annealed composite to a desired carrier can be carried out by known methods. In particular the annealed product is conjugated to tetanus toxoid using SPDP in the same manner as β hCG. The conjugated material eluted in the void volume of the column. The descending half of the peak showed unresolved components. Some fractions were pooled and rechromatographed on the same column. Rechromatograph of the pooled fraction gave a homogeneous symmetrical peak. In a typical preparation, the material eluted in void volume accounted for about 51 of the total material eluted in all the three peaks. Upon rechromatography, the purified CHB β hCG conjugate recovered was of the order of 36 of the total material. Female bonnet monkeys Macaca radiata of proven fertility carrying either pups or lactating at time of supply were immunized with the conjugates, β hCG TT, β oLH TT, β oLH TT β hCG, β hCG TT β oLH TT, α oLH. β hCG TT all absorbed on alum. Three injections containing 50 µg gonadotropin equivalent at monthly interval were given intramuscularly at two contralateral sites. In the first injection only 1 mg SPLPS was added. Animals with low titers were given a booster injection with the respective antigen on day 145 along with a non toxic metabolizable lipidic emulsion, Leiras basic adjuvant Leira Huhtamaki, Turku, Finland . Adult female rats weighing 200 300 g were also immunized with α oLH. β hCG TT and β hCG TT conjugates 10 µg gonadotropin . The first injection was given with SPLPS after absorbing on alum, the following one with alum only. Sera were collected at intervals and stored at 20 C until used. The hCG binding capacity of the antisera was determined by methods described in Shastri Antibody response was generated in monkeys with β oLH without the use of Freund s complete adjuvant FCA when it was injected as a conjugate with the carrier tetanus toxoid TT . Figure 1 gives the kinetics of response in five bonnet monkeys immunized with 50 µg of β oLH TT adsorbed on alum, 1 mg detoxified non pyrogenic SPLPS was added in the first injection. Three of the five monkeys had peak titers between 200 320 ng ml expressed as hCG binding capacity. The extensive known studies have indicated the virtual identity of the hLH and hCG reactivity of monkey sera immunized with β oLH. Two monkeys were relatively low responders, in which the primary immunization gave rise to optimum titers of 40 60 ng ml. These were given a fourth booster injection on day 145 which increased the titers to 60 ng ml and 900 ng ml respectively. However a considerably improved antibody response was attained when immunization was carried out with β oLH and β hCG tagged to a common carrier, TT, to form a mixed conjugate β oLH TT β hCG. Injections with the same dose of the antigen 50 µg equivalent of gonadotropin gave in three monkeys peak titers between 750 to 1300 ng ml Figure 2 . The response was sustained and above 100 ng ml in two monkeys for nearly a year. Assuming 60 ng ml of anti hCG titers as a cut off point for efficacy, the area under the curves above this threshold for the two formulations is given in Table 1. The cumulative antibody response with the mixed conjugate was about 13 times higher than with β oLH on the same carrier employing a common dose and immunization schedule. The time duration over which this response was manifest was twice as long with β oLH TT β hCG than with β oLH TT. The β hCG TT immunized monkeys Figure 3 following the same dose and time schedule produced after the 3 primary injections, peak titers ranging from 7 500 ng ml, the fourth booster injection raising the titers to 70 800 ng ml. Monkey no. 93 died on day 171 after immunization due to diarrhea. Autopsy did not reveal any pathology associated with immunization. The mixed formulation could consist of the two types of subunits tagged to a common carrier β oLH TT β hCG or as an alternate each one of them could be coupled individually to the carrier and employed as a physical mixture β oLH TT and β hCG TT . Figure 4 summarizes the results of the experiment in which the monkeys received 25 µg each of β oLH TT and β hCG TT. Two of the monkeys 110 and 111 had peak titers of 3200 and 3500 ng ml respectively. The characteristics of the antibodies were similar to those generated by β oLH TT β hCG. Figure 6 gives the antibody titers in a group of five monkeys immunized with α oLH. β hCG TT conjugate. Three of the five monkeys produced high titers of antibodies 1500 ng ml to 5200 ng ml . The antibodies started appearing after the first injection around day 33, reached maxima at 75 days and then declined to a level which was more or less sustained for 5 to 10 months. Using a similar injection schedule and equivalent dose, the antibody response with the known vaccine β hCG TT was distinctly lower Figure 3 . The latent period of antibody titers was 45 days. The titers reached after three primary injections were between 7 500 ng ml with a tendency to decline fairly rapidly necessitating an additional booster injection on day 145. The antibody titers after the fourth injection ranged from 70 ng ml to 800 ng ml. The use of β hCG annealed to α oLH in the conjugate was thus distinctly beneficial in raising the level of immune response, employing non toxic adjuvants. Assuming that the normal threshold for protection against pregnancy be 60 ng ml of hCG binding capacity, the antibody response above this level in good responders and the duration over which it lasts for the two formulation is given in Table 1a. It may be pointed out that fixing the threshold of 60 ng ml is a tentative criteria as most monkeys in the colony under test with various formulations became pregnant at titers below 50 ng ml. There were however a few which required titers above 140 ng ml to remain infertile. The degree of cross reaction of the anti hCG antibodies with monkey chorionic gonadotropin mCG is low and varies from animal to animal depending on the determinants to which the antibodies are raised. α oLH. β hCG TT was also found superior to β hCG TT for induction of anti hCG response in rats Figure 7 . A regimen of two injections was given at 6 weekly intervals. Following the first injection, 5 out of 6 rats immunized with α oLH. β hCG TT had circulating antibodies 6 to 720 ng ml whereas in those immunized with β hCG TT only two had antibodies 2 to 6 ng ml . After the second injection, 5 out of 6 rats immunized with β hCG TT had antibody titers ranging from 3 ng ml to 130 ng ml on day 64. On the other hand in case of α oLH. β hCG TT, 6 out of 6 rats had antibodies in circulation at this time and their titers were from 130 ng ml to 1870 ng ml. The association constant Ka of antibodies for binding with hCG is given in Table 2 for the mixed conjugate formulation and for β oLH TT. Both antigens induced antibodies of high affinities. The cross reactivity of antibodies generated by the two immunogens with various pituitary hormones is given in Table 3. No cross reaction with hFSH and hTSH was observed in either case. Both formulations produced antibodies reacting with hCG and hLH. Some sera generated by β oLH TT cross reacted with hCG and hLH to nearly the same extent, those with β oLH TT β hCG had slightly greater cross reactivity with hCG. Association constant Ka of the antibodies induced by the new composition, α oLH. β hCG TT was from 1x10⁹ to 2x10¹⁰ M ¹ for binding with hCG Table 2a . The presence of α oLH as an associated subunit did not lead to cross reactive antibodies to human thyroid stimulating hormone hTSH and follicle stimulating hormone hFSH Table 3a . The cross reactivity with human leutinizing hormone hLH was of the order of 44 to 80 Table 3a . Recent studies have demonstrated the lack of hazard of antibodies cross reactive with LH after five years of hyper immunization. The cross reactivity with LH was in fact beneficial and contributory to control of fertility. Thau, R.B., Sundaram, K., Thornton, Y.S. and Seidman, L.S. 1979 Fertil. and Steril. , 31, 200 204 Immunized monkeys were mated continuously with males. The antifertility effect of these formulations and titers preventing pregnancy are given in Table 4. However, some animals shown in Table 5 became pregnant when the antibody titers were low. Monkeys 92 and 94 immunized with the β oLH TT β hCG were mated 7 and 5 times respectively with males of proven fertility. Out of these 6 and 3 cycles were confirmed to be ovulatory by progesterone estimations. In the colony, continuous caging of bonnet female monkeys with males results in 70 of animals becoming pregnant in the first month and the remaining 30 in the following month. These immunized monkeys were thus apparently protected from becoming pregnant. The antibody titers during this period ranged from 80 800 ng ml in these monkeys. Monkeys No. 88 and 89 became pregnant when the antibody titers were 35 and 4 ng ml respectively. These observations are consistent with those of others and our own where fertility is observed to be regained in primates at low antibody titers. In β oLH TT immunized animals, monkey No. 106 was mated six times and all the six cycles were ovulatory. She did not conceive. The prevailing antibody titers in this monkey were between 60 200 ng ml. Monkey No. 104 remained protected in three matings carried out during the period when antibody titers were 120 150 ng ml. Monkey No. 105, 107 and 108 became pregnant at time points at which antibody titers were 120, 30 and 10 ng ml respectively. It may be mentioned that the titers described are against hCG, their cross reactivity with the bonnet CG is not known. The cross reactivity of anti hCG antibodies with primate CG is usually of a lower order in baboons it has been described to be between 2 to 10 . The wide variation in primates of the amount of CG produced during pregnancy from animal to animal has also been reported 10 50 IU ml . Immunization with the more immunogenic conjugate α oLH. β hCG TT of the present invention did not lead to l disturbances in reproductive functions in four monkeys out of five which kept ovulating normally. Monkey No. 102 developed anovulatory cycles. It had however low antibody titers indicating that it was not related to immunization. Some control untreated monkeys maintained in captivity also become anovulatory. Two of the monkeys Nos. 96 and 101 , who to begin with were of proven fertility did not become pregnant in spite of repeated matings 6 and 3 respectively with males having sired off spring in the colony. The antibody titers during this period ranged in these monkeys from 400 2600 ng ml. The fertility rate amongst untreated animals in the colony is between 50 75 depending on whether they are mated intermittently day 9 14 of the cycle or mated continuously. Monkey No. 99 became pregnant at 30 ng ml antibody titer. Monkey No. 100 did not become pregnant on mating twice with males of proven fertility, the antibody titer during the period was between 200 360 ng ml. It became pregnant when the antibody titer was 140 ng ml. The titer described is against hCG and not mCG, which could not be determined due to non availability of bonnet monkey CG. All conjugates are well tolerated. No local reaction was noted at the site of injection. Acute and subacute toxicology studies revealed no side effects. No significant abnormality in metabolic and organ functions was observed in the hematological and clinical chemistry parameters determined at an interval of three months over a period of fifteen months. The antibodies were devoid of smooth muscle, parietal cell, thyroid, microsomal, thyroglobulin, antinuclear, anti mitochondrial, anti DNA, C reactive protein, rheumatoid factor and anti islets cell reactivity. In each formulation, 2 to 3 monkeys were relative low responders. Additional booster injections with the same conjugate improved responsiveness to some extent. Figure 1, 2 and 5 . An alternate carrier, cholera toxin B chain was utilized to see whether the responsiveness of such monkeys could be improved. Figure 5 gives the results of two monkeys immunized with the physical mixture of β oLH TT and β hCG TT. The peak titers after primary immunization in the monkey 113 and 112 were 10 ng ml and 45 ng ml respectively. A booster on day 145 with the same conjugate increased the titers to 60 ng ml and 250 ng ml. They were then immunized on day 431 and 479 with β hCG conjugated to cholera toxin B chain which boosted the titers to 1340 ng ml and 2800 ng ml, hCG binding capacity. Similar observations were made for two low responders to β oLH TT. The peak titers after 3 injections in the monkey 107 and 108 were 60 and 40 ng m1. A booster on day 145 with the same conjugate increased the titer to 900 ng ml and 60 ng ml respectively. They were immunized on day 431 and 479 with β hCG conjugated to cholera toxin B chain which boosted the titers to 4000 and 2130 ng ml hCG binding capacity. Monkey No. 99 was a low responder to α oLH. β hCG TT. Being given that the carrier would be mobilizing helper T cell function, it could be hypothesised that the low titer in this animal could be due to its low responsiveness to TT. However when the immunogen was conjugated to an alternate carrier, the B chain of cholera toxin CHB , a boost in the anti hCG response was noted. The animal had a peak titer of 80 ng ml after the first three primary injections, an additional booster with the same carrier raised the antibody titer to 180 ng ml Figure 8 . On immunization with CHB as carrier, the titers reached 1700 ng ml. Similar observations were made for low responders amongst monkeys immunized with β hCG TT Figure 8 . The feasibility of controlling fertility with antibodies generated by β oLH has already been demonstrated in a variety of animal species including the subhuman primates. The procedure adopted however demanded the use of Freund s complete adjuvant CFA . CFA is not permissible for human use. An eventual birth control vaccine based on this antigen would require an approach which can lead to the formation of enough antibodies without the use of CFA. Linkage of β oLH to tetanus toxoid TT has rendered it immunogenic in monkeys with a simple permissible adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide. Detoxified sodium phthalyl derivative of salmonella lipopolysaccharide SPLPS was employed in the first injection only. SPLPS has been used in clinical trials without adverse effects Elin, R.J., Wolff, S.M., McAdam, K.P.W.J., Chedid, L., Audibert, F., Bernard, C. and Oberling, F. Properties of reference hCG, a glycoproteinic hormone is composed of two subunits α and β. The association of the two subunits generates a conformation fitting optimally the receptors on the male and female steroid hormone producing cells. Dissociation leads to a conformation with 400 fold reduced potency of stimulating steroidogenesis even though the β subunit of hCG retains a residual form binding less well to the receptor and stimulating the hormonal response. Ramakrishnan, S., Das, C. and Talwar, G.P. 1978 Biochemical Journal, 176, 599 602 It is thus clear that the biologically effective optimal conformation of the hormone results only on its association with the α subunit. This conformation is important for inducing antibodies with optimal potential of neutralizing the bioactivity of this hormone. The idea of annealing β hCG to α oLH was to generate the conformation optimally fitting into tissue receptors, which hopefully could induce conformational antibodies interfering with the hormone target tissue interaction. Homologous α subunit was not advisable as it would have led to the induction of antibodies cross reactive with hFSH and hTSH, both of which contain a common α subunit. The α subunit of oLH on the other hand did not give cross reactive antibodies to the human hormones. Surprisingly, annealing β hcG to α oLH gives rise to a receptor binding potency two times higher and steroidogenic potency three times higher than the homologous combine of the human hormonal subunits. α oLH.β hCG TT is a distinctively better immunogen than β hCG TT in both rodents and bonnet monkeys. The increment in anti hCG peak titers geometric means by the use of the new conjugate composition was of the order of 18 and 10 fold in rodents and monkeys respectively. This appears to be adequate for protection against pregnancy as judged by the limited fertility studies. The secretion of hCG starts in the preimplantation period as indicated by recent report on The use of mixed carriers is beneficial to evoke good response in those subjects who are poor responders to a given carrier. CHB is a good supplement to TT. Other carriers such as hepatitis B and sporozoite coat protein of Immunization against fertility can also be effected by a polyvalent vaccine which includes a sperm antigen such as LDH C₄ used either as a carrier linked for example to β hCG as shown in Table 6, or used together with a carrier such as tetanus toxoid. Table 6 shows the reduced fertility in female mice when immunized with a vaccine of LDH C₄ linked to β hCG.
