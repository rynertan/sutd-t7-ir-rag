# An instrument for filling an injection syringe.

## Abstract
An instrument for filling an injection syringe of non recurrent or multiple use type to be used in particular by a person with defective vision comprises a body portion 1 permitting securing of a medicament bottle 5 and an injection syringe 6 , so that the needle of the syringe precisely hits and penetrates the cap of the bottle. An axially displaceable dosage rod 2 coacts with the syringe s plunger part 6b so that filling of predetermined dose in the syringe is effected. A finger actuated control knob 3 journalled at the body portion accomplishes via a worm gear 3b, 2b the axial displacement of the dosage rod. The end 2a of the dosage rod may be laterally resilient and possibly provided with a driving dog coacting with the end plate 6c of the plunger part.

## Description
An instrument for filling an injection syringe The present invention concerns an instrument for filling an injection syringe of non recurrent or multiple use type intended for use especially by a person with defective vision. In US patent 3,610,241 there is described a previously known instrument of this kind designated guide and comprising a body portion having means for securing a medicament or drug bottle and a syringe so that the needle of the syringe precisely hits and penetrates the cap of the bottle, and having an axially movable dosage rod which by coaction with the plunger part of the syringe permits drawing in a predetermined volume into the syringe. In this known device the dosage rod proper is directly finger actuated which in practise will involve great risks of false dosage, especially when the syringe is manipulated by a person with defect vision. Further, the known instrument does not permit sufficient exactness in the dosing operation. An object of the present invention is to provide an instrument of the abovementioned kind which by avoiding the drawbacks in instruments previously knwon permits accurate setting of an ordinated dose and reliable filling of the syringe also by a person with defective vision. The instrument according to the invention is substantially characterized by a finger actuated control member which is rotatably journalled at the body portion and via a transmission means effects the displacement of the dosage rod. Due to the fact that the dosage rod in the way mentioned is actuated by a special control member via a transmission means the risk is avoided that the rod shall take an undesired wrong position, for instance by hitting an item when being manupulated. The transmission means may namely contribute to automatically retain the dosage rod in the position set, so that it cannot be shifted therefrom. In addition the control member and the transmission means permit substantially greater exactness when setting the determined dose. In practise it is preferred that the control member consists of a knob rotatable around an axis perpendicular to the axis of the syringe. Such a control knob permits simple and reliable actuation of the dosage rod and may for this purpose have one or several clearly noticeable and or audible markings per revolution which can be accomplished by a ball latch or the like. Further, it is preferred that the control knob via a worm gear actuates the dosage rod. At the same time such a worm gear form a reliable retaining means which secures the dosage rod in the position set. In one embodiment the dosage rod is laterally resilient so that at filling of the syringe it permits transit of the end plate of the syringe 5 plunger part but at the return of the said plunge part springs back while forming a stop for the said end plate. The syringe will then contain correct volume or dose. Alternatively or in addition the end of the dosage rod may be designed as a driving dog engaging the plunger part s end plate and then contribute to the displacement of the rod. In one embodiment the body portion is adapted to permit axial displacement of the bottle relative to the syringe. Then it will be possible to release the bottle from the syringe when the latter is secured on the body portion. Thus, it will be possible to release the bottle from the syringe in order to apply a new bottle without the need of changing the position of the syringe. The invention shall now be more closely described with reference to the accompanying drawing. Figure 1 is a vertical section through an embodiment of an instrument according to the invention, the medicament bottle and the syringe being applied in position. Figure 2 is a plan view of the instrument, however without bottle and syringe. Figure 3 is a front view of the instrument according to Figure 2. Figure 4 is a detail view illustrating a modification of the end of the dosage rod coacting with the plunger part of the syringe. Figure 5, finally, is a detail view illustrating a modification of the end of the instrument which coacts with the bottom of the medicament bottle. Referring to Figures 1 3 an instrument for filling an injection syringe of non current or multiple use type consists of a body portion 1 having at one end a space for positioning a medicament bottle 5 and at the other end a space for positioning an injection syringe 6. To position the medicament bottle the body portion may comprise vertical walls la coacting with the bottom and cap, respectively, of the bottle.Alternatively or in addition the bottle may be secured by providing the bottle space of the body portion with resilient side walls or a separate rear spring not shown forcing the bottle towards the wall la engaging the cap. The injection syringe can be secured correspondingly and, further, by hooks or snap members lb situated at the end of the body portion and engaging a flange 6a on the syringe. To permit correct setting of the medical dose a dosage rod 2 is displaceably movable in a space at the bottom side of the body portion. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1 3 the end 2a of the dosage rod 2 is laterally resilient and adapted to serve as a stop for an endplate 6c at the syringe s plunger part 6b. To displace the dosage rod 2 a fingeractuated control knob 3 is journalled at the body portion so that it is rotatable around an axis perpendicular to the axis of the syringe.To improve the gripping reliability the knob is provided with cuts or indententions 3a. The upper side of the control knob 3 as seen in Figure 1 is provided with a worm 3b coacting with corresponding gears at the bottom side of the dosage rod taking the shape of cuts 2b so that a worm gear is formed. Said worm gear will provide carefully guided displacement of the dosage rod and automatic axial securing thereof in the position set. In addition the control knob 3 is provided with one or more distinctly noticeable or audible markings per revolution, in the illustrated embodiment accomplished by a ball latch 8 or the like. A lock plate for the control knob is denoted 4. The instrument shown in Figures 1 3 shall be used in the following manner 1. The bottle 5 is placed in its space. 2. Ordinated dose is set by means of the knob 3. 3. The syringe 6 and its needle 6e is brought against the body portion, displaced forwardly and locked by means of the hooks lb while at the same time the needle 6e has penetrated the membrane cap 5a of the bottle 5. 4. The plunger part 6b is pulled outwardly and the syringe filled. 5. The plunger part is pushed backwards, whereby the end 2a of the dosage rod 2 acts as a stop for the end plate 6c of the plunger part. In the modified embodiment shown in Figure 4 the end of the dosage rod instead is provided with a driving dog 2d coacting with the end plate 6c. In this embodiment turning of the control knob 3, thus, effects displacement of the plunger part via the worm gear 3b, 2b. Rotation one revolution of the control knob may then accomplish displacement of the dosage rod 2 and, further, the plunger part 6b for instance 4 5 mm. In this embodiment finger actuation of the plunger part proper will then not take place. Figure 5 iluustrates and embodiment adapted to permit axial displacement of the bottle 5 so that replacement thereof is permitted while retaining the syringe in its position and without the risk of damage to the needle. For this purpose the side walls lb of the body portion have two or more recesses le in which an insert member 9 may be secured in selected position. The member 9 has a slot 9a adapted to coact with a front flange 5a on the bottle 5 Figure 1 . The body portion lacks a rear wall. This arrangement will also permit simple adaption to syringes and bottles of different size and type. In both embodiments described above at filling the plunger of the syringe may be pulled beyond the actual dosage position and then be pushed back to engage the dosage rod 2.Then it is ascertained that air possibly drawn into the syringe will be removed.
