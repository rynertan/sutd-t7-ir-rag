# Driving circuit for liquid crystal display.

## Abstract
In a circuit 1, 6, 12, 13, 21 for driving a liquid crystal display element, during a latter half part of an indication renewal period a common electrode is supplied with lower maximum and higher minimum voltages than the maximum and minimum voltages supplied during a first half part of the indication renewal period, in order to enhance response speed of the liquid crystal display element 5 .
