# Expandable tool including a cutting section and a guiding portion or portions.

## Abstract
A rotatable cutting tool 10 includes an ex pandable cutting section 40 and a leading end having an expandable guiding portion or pilot 16 for properly aligning the tool in a bore. The trailing end of the tool may have an expandable guiding portion or pilot 18 for aligning the tool during movement back trough the bore which has been machined. A one piece body 20 of the tool has a helical slot 24 extending axially therethrough and has an inner tapered surface 26 for mounting the tool on a tapered shaft 12 such that movement of the body along the shaft by nuts 34, 36, 38 controls the size of the cutting section and the guiding portion or portions. This expand able tool construction is particularly suitable for abrasion tools and has abrasive particles 22 secured to the cutting section 40 .
