# CATALYST COMPOSITION FOR POLYMERIZING ALPHA OLEFINS

## Abstract
A catalyst composition for polymerizing alpha olefins is prepared by treating a carrier containing OH groups with an or ganomagnesium composition and contacting the thus formed magnesium containing carrier with a solution of at least one tetravalent vanadium compound. The solution may also con tain at least one tetravalent titanium compound in addition to the vanadium compound, thereby producing catalysts contain ing both, vanadium and titanium.
