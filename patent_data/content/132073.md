# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING METALLIC NIOBIUM OR METALLIC TANTALUM

## Abstract
Metallic niobium or metallic tantalum is produced by a process which comprises bringing a fluorine containing com pound of niobium or tantalum A into contact with a gas comprising hydrogen at a temperature of at least 400 C or B into contact with metallic aluminium, metallic magnesium or metallic lead, at a temperature of at least 300 C to convert the fluorine containing compound into the corres ponding metal.
