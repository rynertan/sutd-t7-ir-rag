A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings whereins Figure 1 is a front elevation of a preferred embodiment of a rear view mirror according to the invention, il. tj tiie mirror glass partly broken awev to show internal details of the mirror Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the mirror taken along the line II II of Figure 1, the mirror glass being shown in the normal viewing position P i iirp 3 is an exploded zinctional view of the mirror along the line Il Il of Figure 1, the mirror glass being shown in the anti glare position Figure 4 is an exploded view on an enlarged scale of a ball and socket joint at the rear of the mirror housing coupling a mounting arm to the mirror Figure 5 is a circuit diagram of the electrical assembly of the mirror and Figure 6 is a circuit diagram of an alternative for of electrical assembly for the mirror. Referring to the drawings there is shown a rear view mirror comprising a housing 2 formed as a plastic moulding in two parts, namely a back plate part 4 and a front frame part 6. Located between. the two parts of the housing is a mirror glass 8 movable between a normal viewing position Figure 2 and an anti lare position Figure 3 in which glare from light reflected from the mirror is. reduced. The mirror is pivotable about a pivot 10. An electrical assembly 12 formed as a single unit is mounted within back plate 4. The assembly includes a photosensor 14 which receives ht incident upon the mirror arid transmitted through mirror lass 8. The assembly also includes a solenoid coil 16 which is enersized in response to light incident upon the mirror above a predetermined. intensity, the coil co actinz with a magnetic member i8 carlwied by the mirror class to move the mirror glass from its nonnaL position to an anti glare position when the solenoid is energized. The mirror glass is eld in its normal position in normal operation by means of a return string 20. The mirror is mounted to the motor vehicle by niectns of a mounting arm 22 attached to the rear of the housing 2. Referring now in more detail to the construction of the housing, back plate 4 is in the form of a tray with rear walls 30 Figure 4 tapering to provide a deepen portion at the centre of the tray. Reinforcing ribs 32 are provided for strengthening the tray and the centre of the tray carries three fixing studs 31 to retain the electrical assembly 12. The rear of tiie back plate provide a socket 36 of r ball and socket Joint which serves to receive a ball member 3 of mounting arm 22.Mounting arm 22 is thus held mounted to back plate 4 by means of a universal ball and socket joint. socket 36 is designed to permit various configurations of mounting arms having different size end portions to be mounted to the back plate. Referring to the construction of socket 36 as shown in Figure 4, a boss portion 40 at tulle rear of the back plate has a vertical bore 42 of circular section which coemunicates with a slot 44 in the surface of the boss to permit the mounting arm 8 to extend from the bore 42. The top portion of the bore 2 is tapered as at 46 to permit ball joints of different sizes to make a good fit with the bore. This may occur where a motor vehicle has already installed an appropriate mounting arm.A locking member 48 is provided having a cylindrical portion 50 making a reasonably close fit within bore 42 and having a recessed top portion 52 providing A seat for ball 38. Locking member 48 is locked in position by means of two self tapping screws 54 extending through apertures 56 in wing portions 58 of locking member 48.Wing portions 58 are arranged to fit within recesses 60 of boss 40 and screws 54 extend into the interior of back plate 4 to extend through regist.ring apertures 62 in a reinforcing rib 32. Apertured spring steel clips 64 are mounted over apertures 62 in order to receive screws 5 and to engage the threads thereof so that screws cati be tightened to secure the locking member 48. The top of boss 40 has a ribbed surface 66. mounting arm 22 shown has a flat surface 70 which may be adhesively mounted by means of an adhesive pad to the window of a motor vehicle.Reinforcing ribs 72 are provided on the otter side of surface 70 in order to strengthen the surface and to prevent warping. The front surface of back plate member 4 has at its base an aperture 80 through which part of the electrical assembly, a sensitivity adjustment thumb wheel 82 projects. The front surface of back plate 4 has apertures 84 spaced around the surface which serve in the securing of the front frame 6 to back plate 4. Front frame 6 is generally rectangular in configuration and possesses projecting nodules 86 around its periphery which interengage with recesses 84 in back plate 4 as a snap fit in order to secure together back plate 4 and front frame 6. Front frame 6 has a recessed portion 38 in order to receive mirror glass 8.A further recessed portion 90 extends along the lower edge of the front of back plate 4 and co operates with recess 88 in order to provide a longitudinal U shaped recess. This U shaped recess serves to support the lower ed,e of mirror lass It and to hermit the mirror class to pivot about pivot 10. As an alternative arrangement, recess 38 and recess yO may be shaped to provide a recess circular in section and a cylindrical element may be provided to fit within the recess and to support the mirror .glass Li, the Lower edge of the mirror glass fitting within an axial slot in the cylindrical lo.nt. Mirror glass 8 is of conventional construction.Mirror glass 8 is only partly silvered in the region 100 opposite photosensor 14 by providing a series of transparent line in order to permit incident light to be transmitted through the mirror to photosensor 14. This arrangement provides a collimation effect for light passing through the mirror on to photosensor 14 and this renders the irror more sensitive to light from headlaps of vehicles behind the motor vehicle containing the rear view mirror as compared with other lights for example courtesy lights within the motor car or street lighting. The electrical assembly 12 is formed as a single unit and includes a board 104 upon which the other elements of the assembly are mounted. The board has apertures registering with studs 34 in order to secure the assembly to back plate 4. Locking clips 106 are provided to fit on studs 34.The assembly is powered from a suitable circuit e.g. sidelight circuit energized by the vehicle battery and leads will be fed through the back plate 4 in a suitable manner. Photosensor 14 which may com prise a photodiode is connected sc Figure 5 to a potentiometer in the for of a thuab wh el 82 which reg slates the sensitivity of thc electricÅa assembly, i.e. the thumb wneel 82 predetermines the intensity of light incident upon the photosensor 14 at which the electrical assembly will be actuated to move the mirror to the antiglare position. The movable contact 106 of thumb wheel 82 is connected by a series resistance 108 and a reverse biased diode 110, connected between resistor 108 and ground, to the base of a transistor 112. The collector circuit of transistor 112 includes solenoid coil 16. A protection diode 114 is connected across solenoid coil 16. Solenoid coil 16 has a centre tapping which is connected to contacts 116. Contacts 116 are closed wtit n glass 8 is moved to the anti glare position and are shown schemitically in Figures 2 and 3. ss can ba seen in Figures 2 and 3 the physical disposition of the electrical assembly is such ttlAt the core of the solenoid 16 is disposed remote from magnetic member 1 in the normal rest position of the mirror.Magnetic member 18 is secured to the rear of mirror glass by means of an adhesive pad 120 and the mirror glass is retained in the rest position by a return spring 20 coupled between an aperture in a depending tine 122 of magnetic momber t8 and a tine 124 of an upstanding member 126. The edge 1 ìS of member 126 remote from board 104 has r recess 130 to receive tine 122 which engages the base of the recess in order to provide said pivot 10 for the mirror. Pads 140 adhesively secured to the mirror glass are arranged to engage reinforcing rib as at 142 in order to provide a buffer when mirror glass 8 moves to th anti glare position. In operation of the rear view mirror light from headlamps of r vehicle approaching the motor vehicle in which the rear view mirror is mounted may cause light to be incident upon the rear view iirror and this light will be transmitted to the photosensor 14.If the intensity of the light is above r level determined by the setting of potentiometer 82, sufficient current will be generated in resistor 1o8 to switch transistor 110 from its normal non conductive state to a fully conduct ive state. This causes energizing current to flow in the solenoid 16, which creates an electromagnetic field to attract magnetic member 18 and to thus love mirror glass 8 about pivot 10 to the anti glare position Figure 3 in which the amount of light reflected from the mirror glass to the driver of the vehicle is reduced.Now the amount of current required to flow in the solenoid coil to move the mirror to the anti glare position i8 considerably more than that required to hold the mirror in the anti glare position. Accordingly when mirror glass 8 moves to the anti glare position, contacts 116 are closed which has the effect of shorting out part of coil 16 and thus causing a reduced current flow in the solenoid.This current flow is sufficient to hold the mirror glass in the anti glare position for as long as light above the predetermined intensity shiner on the mirror glass.Reduction of the current flow through the solenoid coil permits a longer life expectancy for the components of the circuit assembly. In the alternativ form of electrical assembly shown in Figure 6, part similar to those of Figure 5 are indicated by similar reference numerals. Transistor 112 serves to amplify the current generated in resistor to8 and a main switching transistor 150 is coupled to the collector circuit of transistor 110 via resistors 152, 154 and diode 156. Coil 16 is connected in the collector circuit of transistor 150 together with a series resistor 158. Contets 116 which are closed in the normal position of mirror glass 8 are connected across resistor 158. This alternative form has a higher sensitivity to incident light by virtue of the amplification provided by transis tor 110. When the coil 16 is energized to move mirror glass to the anti glare position, contacts 116 are opened so that resistor 158 is switched into coil 16 in order to reduce current flow through coil 16 and provide a holding current.
