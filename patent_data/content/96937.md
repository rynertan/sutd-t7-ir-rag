# Method of preventing overloading of the central controller of a telecommunication system and arrangement for performing the method.

## Abstract
In telecommunication systems in which tasks are per formed collectively and centralized by the processor of the central controler, the problem is encountered that this central control may be overloaded. The method in accordance with the invention has for its object to prevent this by rapidly detecting an imminent overload. The number of tasks for example calls being processed and the number of idle jobs which were per formed are taken as a measure of the load. On the basis of the continuously actualized value of the maximum number of tasks which can be handled it is determined at each new task for ex ample a call from a subscriber whether the maximum calls in the process of being set up determined for that period is not exceeded.
