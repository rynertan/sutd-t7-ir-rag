## Description
This invention pertains to waste containment garments such as disposable briefs for incontinent adults, and diapers. More specifically, it pertains to such garments having structural features which render them highly resistant to leakage even when free liquid i.e., unabsorbed liquid is present in the garment. U. S. Patent Re. 26,151 which reissued January 31, 1967 Originally No. 3,180,335, dated April 27, 1965 to Robert C. Duncan discloses a Disposable Diaper having inwardly folded side flaps, and means to fasten the ends of the inwardly folded edges of the side flaps in position over the face of the absorbent pad of the diaper. This patent further recites It is important that the flaps be unsecured in the crotch area so as to permit them to properly function as previously discussed. U. S. Patent 3,860,003 which issued January 14, 1975 to Kenneth Barclay Buell, the inventor herein, discloses Contractable Side Portions For Disposable Diapers. Such diapers have outwardly extending side flaps, and elastic members whereby effective elastic side flaps are formed on the integral diaper and the side flaps being compliant and forming effective seals about an infant s leg. U. S. Patent 4,490,148 which issued December 25, 1984 to Bo Beckestrom discloses a Protector Against Incontinence Or Diaper that has inwardly folded side flaps that are fixed at their ends to the bottom layer, and which side flaps have elasticized free edges. The Beckstrom patent follows the Duncan teaching that such side flaps be unsecured in the crotch area. Indeed, Beckstrom positions the points of fastening the ends of the side flaps to beyond the waistband edges of the absorbent core, and fastens them to underlying portions of the bottom layer i.e., the backsheet. See also US A 4 326.528 whose disclosure corresponds to the pre characterizing part of claim 1. While some of the problems of providing leakage resistant waste containment garments have been at least partially ameliorated by garments disclosed in the background patents, none has solved the problems in the manner of or to the extent of the present invention. For example and not by way of intending to limit the present invention, the present invention has addressed the problem of inversion or outwardly folding of inwardly turned side flaps due to frictional engagement with skin areas of the person on whom the garment is being applied during application of background art type garments on adult incontinents particularly bedridden adult incontinents. Accordingly, among other things, the present invention provides a waste containment garment which comprises side edge leakage guard gutters, and means for substantially obviating their inversion during application and use of the garment. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a disposable waste containment garment comprising a body member having a rear waistband region, a front waistband region, and a crotch region therebetween and which body member comprises a liquid permeable topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, an absorbent core disposed intermediate said topsheet and said backsheet, and two inwardly facing, longitudinally extending, liquid impermeable side edge leakage guard gutters having proximal and distal edges, said gutters being disposed adjacent the longitudinal side edges of said body member, said gutters comprising means for being longitudinally elasticized adjacent said distal edges, wherein said gutters are flexible and extend into the waistband regions of said garment, said garment further comprising securement means arranged so as, in use, to apply laterally directed tension to portions of the proximal edges of said gutters disposed in said waistband regions, said garment also comprising means for substantially obviating inversion of said gutters during application and use of said garment, and being sized and configured with respect to said user to enable said distal edges to contact torso areas of said user throughout the lengths of said distal edges and to substantially preclude said distal edges from encircling the thighs of said user. In one preferred aspect of the invention the means for substantially obviating inversion of the gutters comprises means for securing closed, end portions of the gutters disposed in the waistband regions of the garment and for securing closed only sufficiently long lengths of the gutters in the crotch region of the garment to substantially obviate inversion under normal forces encountered when applying the garment to a user, and leaving the remainder length portions of the gutters freely openable that is, without securing the distal edges of such remainder lengths of the gutters to underlying structure of the garment. In one aspect of the invention only a short length of each gutter adjacent its distal edge is secured to underlying structure in the central crotch portion of the garment i.e., in the vicinity of the lateral centerline of the absorbent core. In another aspect of the invention only a short length of each gutter adjacent its distal edge that is spaced intermediate the central crotch portion and the rear waistband region is secured to underlying structure. And, in a third aspect of the invention, such short lengths in both the central crotch portion and the latter secured portion are secured closed, in addition to the ends of the gutters being closed, while leaving the remainder lengths of the gutters freely openable. Preferably, all of the ends of the gutters are secured closed at about the elevation of where, when the garment is secured on a seated user, the upper portions of the user s thighs intersect the torso of the user most preferably closed about edge portions of the absorbent core albeit it is not intended to thereby preclude suitable closure by securing the ends of the gutters closed by securing portions of the gutter to adjacent portions of other garment structure such as the backsheet or topsheet. While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter regarded as forming the present invention, it is believed the invention will be better understood from the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which identical features in the several views are identically designated and in which An exemplary disposable waste containment garment embodiment of the invention is designated incontinent brief 20 in Figure 1, and is shown therein to comprise a body member 22 two stub belts 23 and 24 which extend laterally outwardly from the front waistband region 25 of body member 22 and which stub belts 23 and 24 are opposite end portions of a front half belt 26 two stub belts 28 and 29 which extend laterally outwardly from the rear waistband region 30 of body member 22 and which stub belts 28 and 29 are opposite end portions of a rear half belt 31 and four tape tab fasteners designated 33 through 36, two each of which are disposed on distal edges 38 and 39 of stub belts 28 and 29, respectively i.e., fasteners 33 and 34 adjacent the ends of distal edge 38 of stub belt 28, and fasteners 35 and 36 adjacent the ends of distal edge 39 of stub belt 29 . As further shown in Figure 1, body member 22 comprises a topsheet 40 a backsheet 41 an absorbent core 42 that is enveloped in tissue paper 43 and disposed intermediate topsheet 40 and backsheet 41 and two longitudinally extending side edge leakage guard gutters 45 and 46 having distal edges 48 and proximal edges 71. The distal edges 48 are shown to be gathered or contracted by elastic means not shown in Figure 1. Portions of backsheet 41, and tissue paper 43 are visible through a hole torn in topsheet 40 along tear line 44 and a portion of absorbent core 42, including its rear edge 47, is also visible through that hole because a portion of the tissue paper 43 is also torn away along tear line 44a. Additionally, in the embodiment shown in Figure 1, four surface areas of the gutters which are disposed adjacent their distal edges are secured to underlying structure i.e., the topsheet two of these are designated central gutter closure zones 51 and 52 which are located in the central crotch region of the garment and the other two are designated rear quarter gutter closure zones 53 and 54 which are disposed about midway between zones 51 and 52, respectively, and the closed ends of the gutters disposed in the rear waistband region of the garment. Basically, without intending to limit the present invention by a brief explanation, the present invention is a waste containment garment that, when provided in adult sizes that are commonly referred to as adult incontinent briefs, are especially useful and leakage resistant when applied to bedridden users. This is so because they have relatively narrow body members that are fitted with inwardly facing side edge leakage guard gutters having elasticized distal edges. When the garment is properly fitted and secured on a user, the elasticized distal edges of the gutters run through the groin areas, and diverge upwardly over both the abdomen and the hips lower back of the user. Additionally, when properly fitted and sized, the proximal edges 71 also lie across hip back and abdominal areas rather than encircling the thighs of the user or overlapping about the sides of the user. The elasticized edges are also precluded by the size and configuration of the body member from encircling the thighs of the user or overlapping around the sides of the user. Importantly, short lengths of the distal edges of the gutters are secured to underlying structure to obviate their inversion during application and use of the garment. In a preferred embodiment, such securement is adjacent the central crotch region of the absorbent core and, more preferably, further comprises an additional area of such securement in the rear hip regions of the user. Friction between the inwardly turned side flaps or gutters and skin areas of users acts to cause such flaps or gutters to be inverted i.e., folded outwardly when such garments are being applied to users, and particularly when being applied to bedridden patients by attendants. The present invention substantially obviates such inversion by securing minor length portions of such gutters closed while leaving the remainder length portions freely openable. Such a garment is highly leakage resistant particularly for bedridden users lying on their sides because the freely openable portions of the gutters act to collect and hold free unabsorbed liquid until it is absorbed into the absorbent core of the garment such liquid usually being at elevations below the adjacent portions of the distal edges of the downside gutter. Accordingly, such a garment can be loosely fitted on a bedridden user for comfort, and still be highly leakage resistant because its elasticized edges do not normally have to function as hydraulic seals. For this reason, such garments are also particularly useful and comfortable when applied to very thin eg, emaciated users who sometimes have concave body areas which areas are spanned by but not contacted by portions of the elasticized edges regardless of the degree of tension. Referring now to Figure 2, incontinent brief 20 of Figure 1 is shown in the flat out, uncontracted state with its topsheet 40 facing the viewer. In this view, the edge of the absorbent core is indicated by a dashed line and designated 55 and a thick portion of the absorbent core is indicated by another dashed line and designated 57. Additionally, in order to clearly show the construction of brief 20, portions of the topsheet 40, the top layer of tissue paper 43, the absorbent core 42, and the back layer of tissue paper 43 are torn away along tear lines 61, 62, 63 and 64, respectively and gutter forming side edge portions of backsheet 41 are torn away along tear lines 65 through 70. Also, two strands 74 of elastic are disposed along each side of the brief, which strands have only their ends adhesively secured between two folded layers of backsheet 41 adjacent the ends of the absorbent core. In addition, each end of each gutter is sealed closed for a length Y by securing the gutter forming edge portion of backsheet 41 to the underlying area of topsheet 40 and each end of each gutter is secured closed for about a length X about an edge portion of the absorbent core 42 with portions of the top layer of tissue paper 43 and topsheet 40 disposed therebetween. Such gutter end sealing and closure are effected by adhesive areas designated 76, portions of two of which are shown exposed and spackled in Figure 2. Two additional areas of adhesive are shown along the right side of brief 20, Figure 2, and are designated 77 and 78. Identical adhesive areas are also provided on the left side of the brief. Adhesive areas 77 and 78 are provided to secure short lengths of the gutters closed to form gutter closure zones 51 through 54, Figure 1. The lengths of the gutters which are not secured closed i.e., the ends and the gutter closure zones are deemed to be freely openable gutter portions. Still referring to Figure 2 the portion of the brief having a length L Absorbent core 42, Figure 3, of brief 20, Figure 1, is somewhat hourglass shaped, has a width designated W Figure 7 is a fragmentary sectional view along section line 7 7 of Figure 2 and shows with exaggerated thicknesses and in enlarged scale that core 42 is enveloped in a full wrap of tissue paper 43 that topsheet 40 substantially covers the entirety of core 42 and has its edge secured to an adjacent area of backsheet 41 that backsheet 41 is U folded about the edge of the wrapped core to overlie the topsheet 40, and that an edge portion of backsheet 41 is U folded back on itself to enclose strands 74 of elastic in a tunnel that is sealed by adhesive 79. The juxtaposed areas of the topsheet 40 and the backsheet 41 are adhesively secured together by adhesive 80 and the ends of the strands 74 of elastic are secured in the backsheet formed tunnel by adhesive 81. Additionally, a portion of the rear half belt 31 is shown secured to backsheet 41 so that stub belt 29 extends laterally outwardly from edge 71. Figure 8 is a fragmentary, longitudinal sectional view taken along section line 8 8 of Figure 2 which shows with exaggerated thicknesses and in enlarged scale the construction of brief 20 along a side edge portion thereof. As stated herebefore, all of the plies over length W Figure 9 is a fragmentary sectional view along section line 9 9 of Figure 2 and shows with exaggerated thicknesses and in enlarged scale the edge gutter construction of body member 22 in the central crotch region where the gutter forming portion of backsheet 41 is secured to the topsheet 40 by adhesive 77. As previously stated, the strands 74 of elastic are preferably not secured to the adjacent areas of the backsheet through this zone. In this view, it is clear that adhesive 77 is spaced a distance FE from distal edge 48. Figure 10 is a fragmentary sectional view along section line 10 10 of Figure 2 and shows with exaggerated thicknesses and in enlarged scale the edge gutter construction of body member 22 in a freely openable span of gutter i.e., a span wherein the portion of the backsheet 41 that overlies the topsheet 40 is not secured thereto. Figure 9a, 10a and 11a are fragmentary lateral sectional views which depict an incontinent brief 20, Figure 1, as it might be shaped when applied to a user, albeit thicknesses of some of the components have been exaggerated for clarity. In particular, Figure 9a depicts gutter 46 facing upward i.e., cupped downward and oriented as it would be with the distal edge 48 of the gutter disposed along the left groin of the user, and the outside surface of the gutter extending downward along the inner thigh of the user and with the absorbent core portion spanning the perineum of the user. In a similar vein, Figure 10a depicts a lateral section disposed rearward from the section of Figure 9a, and shows the gutter 46 standing substantially open ready to catch and contain free i.e., unabsorbed liquid until it can be wicked into and absorbed into adjacent portions of the absorbent core 42. Additionally, this view clearly shows that the gutter would so contain free liquid whether the user was disposed on his or her side, or erect as when seated or standing. This view also clearly shows that the gutter 46 is partially lined by wicking material i.e., the plies of tissue paper 43 which are disposed between the liquid pervious topsheet 40 and the liquid impervious backsheet 41. Such wicking material lining extends throughout the lengths of the gutters and, therefore, the gutters are said to be coherently lined with liquid wicking material. Figure 11a depicts the lateral section of brief 20 in the lower left back portion of a user. In this view, it is clear that lateral tension in the stub belt applies lateral tension to the proximal edge 71 of gutter 46 and that gutter 46 is substantially open with its distal edge 48 disposed inboard from proximal edge 71. As stated hereinabove, this geometry provides effective leakage protection even for users who are lying on their sides by providing reservoirs to catch and contain free liquid until it is absorbed into core 42. An exemplary medium size embodiment of brief 20 that is well suited for users having waist or hip sizes in the range of from twenty six inches 66 cm to forty six inches 117 cm , but more preferably in the range of from twenty eight inches 71 cm to forty four inches 112 cm , is manually constructed as follows albeit it is not intended to thereby limit the present invention. The backsheet 41 is made from a sheet of polyethylene having a thickness of 0.025 mm one mil , and which is seventeen inches wide by thirty one inches long 43 cm by 79 cm . With the backsheet restrained in the flat out position, strands 74 of elastic are stretched about one hundred twenty five percent, and then only their ends are adhered to the backsheet four inches 10 cm from each end. They are spaced so that the strands 74 nearest the side edges are spaced one and one eighth inches 3 cm therefrom and the inboard strands 74 are spaced three eighths of an inch 1 cm center to center therefrom. Then, longitudinal edge portions one inch wide 2.5 cm are U folded up and inwardly over the elastic strands 74 and the distal edge portions of those longitudinal edge portions are secured throughout their lengths to subjacent areas of the backsheet. The longitudinal edges formed by these U folds ultimately become the distal edges 48 of the gutters 45 and 46, as previously designated. The backsheet is then ready to have the absorbent core assembly joined with it. The absorbent core assembly comprises an absorbent core 42 that is fully enveloped and sealed within tissue paper 43. The plan form of the envelope of tissue paper is preferably rectangular albeit the core 42 preferably is hourglass shape as shown in the figures. The absorbent core assembly has a width of eleven inches 28 cm and length of twenty seven inches 69 cm . It is secured to the backsheet with adhesive or double sided tape or the like so that its ends are two inches 5 cm from each end of the backsheet, and with equal width side edge portions i.e., gutter forming portions of the backsheet 41 exposed on each side. The absorbent core assembly is then covered by the topsheet which has a length equal to the length of the backsheet, and a width of twelve inches 30.5 cm . Its edge portions which extend beyond the edges of the absorbent core assembly are then secured to underlying areas of the backsheet. The gutter forming edge portions of the backsheet are then U folded along the longitudinal edges of the absorbent core assembly and secured by adhesive in areas 76, Figure 2, in each corner, and the adhesive areas 77 and 78 adjacent each distal edge 48 as previously described. The longitudinal edges formed by these last U folds are alternatively designated longitudinal side edges or proximal edges 71. This completes the assembly of the body member 22 of brief 20. The body member 22 of brief 20 is then turned over and the half belts 26 and 31 are secured thereto in the positions indicated in the drawings. In the exemplary embodiment, the half belts are two ply laminates an outer lamina of polyethylene film such as used for the backsheet 41 and an inner lamina of nonwoven polypropylene. Both half belts have a lateral dimension of twenty five inches 63.5 cm and the front half belt 26 and the rear half belt 31 have longitudinal lengths i.e., the heights of the front and rear waistband regions, respectively of six inches 15 cm and eight inches 20 cm , respectively. The factory bond ends of adhesive tape tab fasteners 35 through 38 are secured to the four corners of the back half belt 31 as shown in Figures 1 and 2 to complete the assembly of brief 20. While the construction of the exemplary brief 20 has been described as comprising laminated half belts, four discrete stub belts could obviously be utilized, and they could be made entirely from air permeable material to be breathable. However, it is not intended to limit the present invention to construction having four stub belts. Additionally, while the above described construction provides gutters having widths W The brief 20, is applied to a user for example a bedridden person by positioning the rear waistband region 30 under the person s back, and drawing the remainder between the person s legs so that the front waistband region 25 is positioned across the front of the person. The user s bond ends of the tape fasteners are then secured preferably to outwardly facing areas of the front stub belts 23 and 24. In this manner, attachment tension in the stub belts is positively applied to the proximal edges 71 of the portions of the gutters disposed in the waistband regions of the brief. This, acts in conjunction with the elasticized distal edges 48 of the gutters to provide the gutter dispositions and functions described hereinbefore. When so applied, the distal edges of the gutters extend through the groin regions, and up the lower back and the abdomen of the user and the proximal edges also lie on the lower back and abdomen of the user. Neither the proximal nor the distal edges encircle the thighs of the user or extend in overlapping relation around the sides of the user. When such a garment is fitted on a user, the thickness of the region 57 of absorbent core 42, and the fact that the elastic strands 74 are only secured at their ends and extend through tunnels along the distal edges of the gutters, induces folding of the garment along the lateral end edges of region 57 and gathers the portions of the gutter disposed outboard therefrom much more so than adjacent the central crotch region. This is depicted in Figure 1 by depicting highly gathered portions of the distal edges 72 as being scalloped while not so scalloping the lesser gathered portions. This provides a high degree of elongation contraction where it is most needed, i.e., in the lower rear hip regions of the wearer when the user s geometry changes significantly as the user sits, walks, etc.
