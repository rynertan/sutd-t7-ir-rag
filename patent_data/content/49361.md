# Flyback power supply.

## Abstract
The specification describes a flyback power supply with secondary circuit damping during primary charging. This reduces the induced or reflected oscillations into the primary circuit and superimposition onto the primary current so that the latter becomes a monotonically increasing function, permitting and facilitating feedback control. The power transistor 14 is connected in series with the primary winding of a flyback transformer. The transistor 14 is alternately switched on and off by a drive circuit 15 which receives a feedback signal from the output circuit. This circuit comprises the secondary winding, diode D1, and capacitor C1 supplying the load and has the parasitic stray capacitance Cs. The damping circuit comprising resistor Rd and diode Sd damps oscillatory currents during the charging cycle.
