## Description
This invention relates to an extractor designed to increase and regulate natural ventilation in industrial and or agricultural buildings, such as industrial machining sheds, livestock breeding farms, greenhouses and the like. It is known that such buildings produce heat and harmful gases or fumes which must be continuously eliminated by means of a suitable air changing system. For obvious economic reasons, this problem is normally solved using ventilation systems with natural air circulation, which are simply called static extractors . Only in particularly difficult cases, or in the presence of poison gases, use is made of ventilation systems with forced air circulation, equipped with appropriate ventilating fans. It should however be remembered that such fans even apart from the costs always cause localized air draughts which are harmful in some cases for instance, in greenhouses , and for the health of the environment. The afore specified static extractors are usually installed at the top of a building either on the summit of the roof or on the highest part of the side walls for sucking stale air from the same. The intake of fresh air is instead guaranteed by a number of flap doors, or other similar openings, installed in the lower part of the building. These extractors must simultaneously satisfy two fundamental and contrasting requirements, that is, on one hand they must prevent external atmospheric agents from propagating inside the building and, on the other hand, they must guarantee the outlet of an air stream which is extremely even and the flow of which varies according to requirements. For what concerns the first problem, while it is relatively simple to prevent the inlet of water and snow, it is instead very difficult to prevent the access of wind, unless greatly reducing the free outlet sections of the extractor, thereby reducing the flow of outgoing air. On the other hand, it is particularly important to prevent the incoming wind from causing a reversal of the flow of outgoing air, and a consequent inlet of cold air from the top of the building, rather than from the openings provided for this purpose in the lower part of the building itself. In fact particularly in the winter season, when the flow of outgoing air is reduced to a minimum as will be better explained herein after the cold air eventually coming in from the top draws along with it the masses of stale rising air, recycling them with no possibility of control and hampering the regular change thereof. Furthermore, it causes undesired air draughts and an uncontrollable increase of the amount of heat required for keeping the environment in the desired conditions of temperature. For what concerns the second problem, namely the control of the flow of fresh air coming out of the extractor, it should be noted first of all that it must be possible to vary said flow between a minimum value, typical of the winter season, and a maximum value which is instead typical of the summer season. The minimum winter value is determined by the requirement to remove the least possible amount of heat in order to maintain a high difference between the indoor and outdoor temperature, while guaranteeing the dilution of the polluting gases circulating in the air and, at the same time, ensuring healthy environmental conditions. The maximum summer value is instead determined by the need to remove as much as possible of the heat produced within the building, in order to ensure the smallest difference between indoor and outdoor temperature for instance, 4 or 5 C . It should at once be noted that the ratio between maximum and minimum flow is quite considerable and it can reach values of fifty or more. Different types of static extractors have been proposed up to date, which have given preference to the solution of either of the aforementioned problems, while only one extractor has been proposed, apt to successfully overcome both problems, but the spreading of which has been impeded by the exceedingly high cost thereof. We shall now briefly examine the main static extractors of known type. Perhaps the most widely known and spread static extractor now on the market is the Robertson extractor. This is characterized by a metal device generally mounted on the summit of the roof, having an elliptical cross section, open on top, and being provided inside with an overturned V shaped bent tile surface apt to prevent the inlet of inclement atmosheric agents and to discharge them sideways. This extractor, though being fairly economic, presents however a number of drawbacks, such as the following The original Robertson extractor has been the object of several modifications and improvements, which have given rise to a number of improved extractors, among which we can recall the extractors object of the U.S. Patents No. 3,107,598 and No. 3,182,580 and of the German Patent No. 2,156,189. In these extractors, an attempt has been made to eliminate the drawbacks present in the Robertson extractor, particularly for what concerns the inlet of wind in the extractor itself. This result has been achieved, both by dividing the free outflow section into several sub sections and by providing closing means which should operate in the winter season, or in bad weather conditions, as disclosed for example in GB A 2034879 The partial results obtained with these extractors are however not compensated by the weight and bulk, still very high, as well as by the further complexity deriving from the provision of the new devices. Moreover, the operation of the closing means in reply to unforeseeable events, such as are determined by atmospheric agents particularly wind , can only be done manually, with all the inconveniences deriving therefrom, both from the economical point of view and from the point of view of the results obtained. The British Patent No. 678,032 describes an extractor which has excellent characteristics for what concerns the impenetrability to atmospheric agents, particularly wind. This is obtained, however, thanks to a particularly tortuous and narrow path of the flow of outgoing air, whereby this apparatus is fit only for applications which require a scarce flow of extraction air, or it has to be used in combination with motor driven ventilators. Another type of extractor is described in the Swiss Patent No. 371.879. In this case, the device has a fairly light and simple structure and its free sections are wide enough to allow even high outflow rates of the stale air. Nonetheless, the devices provided therein for preventing the inlet of rain are scarcely efficient and, furthermore, the access to winds blowing crosswise is prevented only by closing all the openings, thereby renouncing to the extracting action. It can finally be said that the heretofore considered extractors, though varying in their achievements which involve different structural problems and hence different costs, still have in common the following drawbacks As already mentioned, there is also a type of static extractor which has successfully solved the aforespecified problems. This extractor is commonly known as the Mueller or Modified Mueller extractor and it consists of a double layer of suitably shaped and spaced blades, as described in the Italian Patent No. 883.144 This last type of extractor has the characteristic of preventing the inlet of wind, no matter what direction it blows from, while it takes advantage of the depression caused by the wind to a further extent in the leeward side of the building in order to accomplish a particularly efficient extraction. However, since this extractor as, obviously, also all the previous ones must clearly be dimensioned according to the maximum summer flow the flow reduction in tile winter season is in fact obtained by gradually closing the flap doors provided in the lower part of the building , and it is furthermore provided with a relatively low specific outflow surface, of relatively high unitary cost, it involves installation costs which are too heavy to allow its proper spreading on the market. The object of the present invention is to overcome the afore specified drawbacks by providing a device which with a structure involving very limited costs and having characteristics of size and weight such as to present no problems of stability during installation allows to adjustably increase the air flow during the summer season, as related to the minimal flow required in the winter season, while preventing the inlet of cold air in any weather conditions. The invention thus relates to an extractor designed to increase and regulate natural ventilation in industrial buildings, of the type installed on the outside of openings provided in the roof or walls of such buildings and comprising at least one controlled flow section, consisting of a static extractor of the type comprising a first outer set of elongated elements having a cross section profile with simple or preferably double outward concavity, said elements being arranged one beside the other, at a distance such as to form between them air passage channels with a convergent section, and a second inner set of similar elements, each arranged behind said air passage channels, said extractor being apt to let through a minimum predetermined flow of stale air torwards the outside of the building, characterised in that, in combination with said controlled flow section, it comprises According to a main characteristic of the present invention, the controlled flow section is constituted by a Mueller or Modified Mueller extractor, as stated heretofore. According to further characteristics of the invention, said dividing means consist of rectangular blades of fiberglass reinforced plastic, and said closing and or regulating means consist of the same blades pivoting on their own axis, or of flap doors pivoting on the edge of said openings and forming a rabbet against the ends of said free flow section. The invention will anyhow be described in detail, hereinafter, with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate some non limiting embodiments thereof, and in which Fig. 1 is a schematic axonometric view of a portion of the extractor according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a schematic cross section view of the same extractor Fig. 3 is a schematic cross section view of an extractor of the Robertson type Fig. 4 is the same view of fig. 2, showing the direction of the fluid stream of a wind blowing crosswise and hitting the extractor Fig. 5 is the same view of fig. 3, showing the direction of the fluid stream of a wind blowing crosswise and hitting the extractor Figs. 6, 7 and 8 are schematic section views of different embodiments of the extractor according to the present invention, installed on a roof, wherein the controlled flow section is constituted by an extractor of the Mueller type Fig. 9 is a schematic section view of the extractor according to the present invention, applied on a wall, wherein the controlled flow section is constituted by an extractor of the Mueller type and Figs. 10 and 11 are two graphs illustrating the operation of the extractor in two practical applications. With reference to figure 1, the extractor according to the present invention is installed on the outside of an opening 1 provided on a roof 2, and it consists of two free flow sections 3 and of three controlled flow sections 4 and 4 . The area of the free flow sections 3, added to the product of the area of the controlled flow sections multiplied by the relative specific surface over which the air flows, is approximately equal to the area of the opening 1. Said controlled flow sections can be divided into The free flow sections 3 are in turn divided into sub sections 6 by a set of parallel rectangular blades 5, positioned longitudinally. These blades are arranged in such a way as to be included into a line enveloping the whole extractor, while ending onto said line, and they are positioned at an angle of between 45 and 80 in respect of the horizontal line. The blades 5 are fixed one to the other and to the sec tions 4 by any suitable means not shown . It should be noted that sections 4 only rest to a slight extent with their lower edge onto the roof 2, to allow the drainage of rainwater which, through the sub sections 6, falls onto that part of the roof 2 situated inside the extractor see figure 2 . The air flow through the free flow sections 3 can be interrupted, in an adjustable way, by a pair of tilting flaps 7, pivoted onto the edge 8 of the roof portion 2 extending inside the extractor. The flaps 7 are dimensioned so as to form a rabbet against the ends of the controlled flow section 4. Alternatively, the air flow through the free flow sections 3 may be regulated and or interrupted by the same blades 5, pivoting on their own axis and caused to rotate by any known means. Figures 2 and 3 compare the dimensions of a Robertson extractor with those of an extractor according to the present invention, showing the same width of the opening provided on the roof of the building to be ventilated it should be here mentioned that the size of the opening must be in proportion to the maximum air flow required . As clearly shown in said figures, for an opening of size L , the Robertson extractor has a width of about 2.2 L and a height of about 1.3 L, while the extractor according to the present invention while being slightly narrower than the Robertson extractor 2 L has a height ranging between L 2 and L 3, thus considerably lower. This makes the extractor according to the invention far superior to other known extractors, as to mechanical stability under the action of wind, and it allows, on one hand, to avoid costly operations of static reinforcement of the roof and, on the other hand, to make the whole device of plastic material, for instance fiberglass reinforced plastic, with further reduction of costs and with great advantages as to the weight of the device and the easy mounting thereof. Figures 4 and 5 show, respectively, the direction followed by the fluid stream over the extractor according to the invention and over a Robertson extractor. It can easily be seen that in the Robertson extractor, owing to the larger size of the openings, the wind is likely to penetrate in the leeward side, as largely demonstrated in practical applications where snowflakes were found to have actually entered the building. Whereas, in the extractor according to the present invention, the position of the blades 5 included into the line enveloping the whole extractor and variably inclined in respect of said line but positioned in the same quadrant thereof the quadrant being formed by a horizontal line and by a vertical line favours the regular reforming of the fluid stream furthermore, the possible turbulence caused by the limited dimensions of the sub sections 6, occurs at the mouth of said sub sections in the form of micro whirls, which in turn determine an air pressure drop, such as to prevent almost entirely the inlet of wind. The extraction effect, as in the Robertson extractor, evidently takes place on the windward side, where a Venturi effect depression is created. Figures 6, 7, 9 and 9 show different embodiments of the extractor according to the present invention, wherein some of the controlled flow sections and or part of the roofings or walls figure 9 comprise Mueller extractors. These sections are marked in the figures with the letter M . In all such embodiments, the surface covered by the Mueller extractor is related in size to a flow value ranging between the minimum winter value and a value twice to three times higher, while the flow required during the summer season i.e. up to 50 or more times higher than the minimum flow value is obtained through the free flow sections 3 of the extractor according to the invention, placed gradually in communication with the opening 1 thanks to the already seen adjustment means. It is quite evident that the heretofore described and illustrated extractor ensures great economy of use, without reducing the quality of the ventilation. In fact, during the winter season when the difference in density between the outgoing hot air masses and the outdoor cold air masses is greatest, whereby the danger of any cold air draughts entering the building is higher owing to the strong disturbance which they create in the air circulation, the free flow sections 3 are completely cut off from the opening 1 via the flaps 7 or, alternatively, they are closed off by the blades 5, rotated up to overlapping. Thus only the Mueller extractor remains in operation, with its excellent heretofore specified characteristics. As the outside temperature gradually increases and the need for a greater flow of fresh air thus grows, the flaps 7 will be gradually opened or, alternatively, the blades 5 rotated, giving rise to an additional flow through the free flow sections 3. It is worth while noting that, during the summer season, any reversals of the air flow or any cold air which may return from the freeflow sections 3, are far less dangerous due to the far smaller difference in density between hot and cold air and, moreover, due to the fact that any cold air draughts entering through the free flow sections 3, would be immediately re expelled by the powerful flow going out from the adjacent section constituted by the Mueller extractor. This means that in every season it is possible to keep the environment in the desired physical conditions, and the level of the polluting gases can be perfectly controlled, thanks to the fact that the system prevents them from being recycled. It should finally be noted that, since the Mueller extractor can be made of materials which are at least partly transparent to light, the extractor according to the present invention can also act as skylight. The last two figures of the drawings show two graphs relating to the fresh air flow ordinates in function of the outside tempera ture abscisses . The abscisses also include the corresponding indoor temperature values Ti and the surface areas of the extractors used Sex . The temperatures are in C, the surface areas in m² and the flow rates in m³ h 10 As can be seen from the graphs, only the Mueller extractors are used up to an outside temperature of approximately 10 12 C X point then, starting from this temperature value, the free flow sections 3 are gradually set to work. The maximum flow for which the Mueller extractors have to be dimensioned is, in this case, only twice or three times the minimum winter flow, instead of being up to 50 or more times greater, as would have been required using the previous technique.
