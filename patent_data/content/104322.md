# A dual differential interferometer.

## Abstract
A dual two beam differential interferometer that mea sures both the amplitude and orientation of propagating, broadband surface acoustic waves 32 . Four beams 16,17,21,22 are focused on a surface 31 . The four reflected beams 16,17,21,22 are separated into two pairs. The two pairs 16,21,25 are detected to produce two signals X,Y that are used to complete amplitude and orientation.
