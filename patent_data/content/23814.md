# FLUID POWER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A fluid power transmission system comprises a fluid power transmitting unit 12 having a mechanical power input provided by movement of a piston 15 relative to a body portion 14 of the transmitting unit 12 and a fluid power receiving unit 13 having a mechanical power out put provided by movement of a piston 15 relative to a body portion 14 of the receiving unit 13 . The piston 15 divides a space within the body portion 14 of each unit 12, 13 into first 16 and second 17 chambers. The first chambers 16 of the units 12, 13 are interconnected by a liquid and the second chambers 17 of the units 12, 13 are interconnected by a gas. Means are disclosed which compensate for changes in the volume of the liquid interconnection due to tempe rature changes so that a mechanical output from the re ceiving unit 13 is not affected by such volume changes.
