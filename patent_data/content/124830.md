# Self scan gas discharge display panel.

## Abstract
A display panel comprising an array of scan cells formed by an array of row scan anodes and an array of column cathodes, the scan anodes operating with the lower surfaces of the cathodes to provide cathode glow. The panel also includes an array of display cells formed by an array of row display anodes and the same cathodes, the display anodes operating with restricted areas on the top surfaces of the cathodes to provide cathode glow. The rows of display cells are offset from the rows of scan cells so that the glow transfer path and display glow cell are disposed in an optimum loca tion for panel operation and life.
