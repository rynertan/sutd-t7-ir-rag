# Method and apparatus for fabricating devices using reactive ion etching.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for fabricating a device is dis closed, which involves a new reactive ion etching technique. Both a high etch rate and, for example, a high etch selectivity are simultaneously achieved with the inventive reactive ion etching technique by discharging an electrode of the reactive ion etching apparatus in response to a preselected criterion, e.g., a magnitude of a DC bias at said electrode which equals, or exceeds, a preselected value.
