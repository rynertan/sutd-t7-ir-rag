## Description
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for washing and drying small animals such as pet or laboratory animals. Particularly, it pertains to an apparatus by which the small animals can be washed and dried automatically and hygienically without using human hands. Small animals, such as dogs or cats, are generally washed by using showers or putting the animals into a bath, and brushing by human hands. However, the animals are not accustomed to water whether it is cold or warm, and so they often struggle during the procedure. Moreover, the coat of said small animals is covered by an aciculum that prevents the penetration of water through the aciculum to the fine soft hair. Therefore, even though the aciculum can be washed by water, the water can not reach and wash the inner fine soft hair. As a result, manual work such as brushing and scrubbing by human hands is required to wash the animals thoroughly. Therefore, washing is diffucult, and human clothing is soiled. Further, when the small animal is washed in a bathroom, hair fallen out from the animal clogs the drain. After the washing prodecure, the coat of the animal must be rubbed with dry cloth, and in addition sometimes dried by a drier. Therefore, the washing of the small animal is burdensome. The document FR A 2 396 504 shows a washing tub having at least one jet water output disposed at an upper part of the inner side walls, and a drain part disposed at the bottom, a footing board installed at a lower part of the tub and vertically adjustable, a movable lid disposed on the opening of the tub, said movable lid having a notch du type à guillotine , see page 2 or a similar passage through which the head of an animal is stuck, and a top panel disposed on this passage, said top panel having a notch, or similar, which is opposite to the notch formed to the movable lid in a manner to constitute the opening for the head of the animal. However, with the apparatus according to FR A 2 396 504, the animal s body is not soaked in the water, but only showered with the water. Therefore, though the outer aciculum of the animal can be washed, the fine soft hair underlying the aciculum will not be washed without human hands washing. It is necessary to brush or scrub since the showered water does not reach the fine soft hair. Accordingly, brushing or scrubbing by human hands through the openings of the apparatus according to the cited reference is indispensable for sufficiently washing the animal to the inner fine soft hair. The present invention is intended to obtain a small animal washing and drying apparatus whereby almost all necessary functions for washing small animals are satisfied, and small animal can be washed regardless of their shoulder height and, even if they struggle, washing water is not scattered out of the washing tub. The apparatus for washing and drying small animal of the present invention comprises, Description of the sub claims is to be found in the following description of the drawings. A first embodiment of the invention is described with reference to Figs. 1 3. In the present invention, a washing tub 2 is installed in an outer case 1, and a footing board 14, e.g. a lattice board, a wire net or punched metal, is disposed at the lower part of the washing tub 2 in such manner that it can be shifted to various level positions in a range from middle to bottom part of the washing tub 2. Plural jet water outlet ports 15a and warm air outlet ports 16 are disposed at the upper part of the inner side of the washing tub 2. The jet water outlet ports 15 are connected to a water supply pressure pump 19, and the warm air outlets 16 are connected to a heating device 23. A drain 26 having a detachable filter is disposed at the bottom part of the washing tub 2. A movable lid 9 for covering the opening of the washing tub 2 is disposed to the upper part of the washing tub 2. A notch 12 is disposed to an end of the movable lid 9. A futher notch 4 is disposed to an end of a top panel 3 located under the movable lid 9, and a head opening port 4a, through which the head of the small animal is stuck out, is formed by both of the notches 4 and 12. In case that the small animal, e.g. a dog or a cat is to be washed, the level of the footing board 14 is adjusted according to the shoulder height of the small animal. The level of cold or warm water in the tub 2, if necessary, with cleansing agent, is regulated by letting in water into the washing tub 2. Thereafter, the small animal is put into the washing tub 2, thereby soaking the small animal s body except the head and the neck. The movable lid 9 is put on the opening part of the washing tub 2. At this time, the head of the small animal is stuck out from the head opening 4a. Spacing between neck of the small animal and the head opening 4a is rather small. Therefore, even if the small animal is struggling, washing water will not be spilled out of the washing tub 2. By operating the water supply pressure pump 19, a water jet is made to eject from the jet water current output ports 15. Thus the water in the washing tub 2 is stirred and the water jet will wash the hair of the small animal. A current may be made only by circulating the water in the washing tub 2, or by supplying fresh water continuously without the circulation of water, depending on situation. Waste water in the washing tub 2 is drained through the drain 26, when the washing is finished. But, there is no danger that the drain is clogged by loose hair of the small animal, since a filter is disposed to the drain 26.

Another cross valve is provided at a connection part of the water supply pipe 21 and the branch water supply pipe 21. The above mentioned valves may be of manual operation type. Furthermore, it is possible and more convenient to use magnetic valves linked with the switches 5, 6 and 7 in a manner to be controlled thereby. In the following, operation of the abovementioned construction is explained with reference to FIGs. 1 to 6. A drain hose 34 is hung to drain hose hanger 39,, and a connector 20a of the water inlet 20 is connected with a faucet. At this time the above mentioned valves 41, 42 and 43 are respectively set up in the states of FIG. 4. That is, the water supply pipe 21 is connected with the branch water supply pipe 21a, and further a drain tank 32 is connected with the circulation pipe 40 which is connected with the water supply pressure pump 19. Under the above mentioned state, water is supplied to the washing tub 2 from the faucet, through the water supply pump 19, the valve 43 and the branch water supply pump 21, valve 43 and the branch water supply pipe 21a by pushing the water supply switch 6. In this case, water is filled not only in the washing tub 2, but also in the drain tank FIG. 5A . It is desirable that the water level is kept at nearly upper edge of the upper drain port 30. Having finished the water supplying, a small animal is put in the washing tub 2 with its head sticking up through the notch 4 of top panel 3. By sliding the movable lid 9, size of the head opening 4a formed by notches 4 and 12 of the top panel 3 and movable lid 9 is adjusted corresponding to the neck size of the small animal. The movable lid 9 can be fixed by screwing the lock nut 13. The valve 43 is closed by turning off the water supply switch 6. Thereby, a connection between the water supply pipe 21 and the branch water supply pipe 21a is cut. Consequently, water supply is cut off. By turning on the washing switch 5, the water supply pump 19 is operated and pressurized water is supplied to the jet water current output pipe 15b through the main water supply pipe 18 and pressurized water supply pipe 17. Thus, jet water current is supplied to the washing tub 2 through the jet water current output port 15a. The water in the washing tub 2 is slirred and mixed with cleansing agent. The washing water reaches aciculum and the fine soft hair underlying the aciculum and skin is thereby washed, too. The washing water is circulated by the water supply pressure pump 19 through a circulation passage from the main water supply pipe 18, through the pressurized water supply pipe 17, the jet water current output pipe 15b, the jet water current output port 15a, the washing tub 2, the drain tank 32, the main drain pipe 33 and the valve 41 to the water circulation pipe 40 FIG. 5B . After finishing the washing of the small animal, the operation of the water supply pressure pump 19 is stopped by turning off the washing switch 5. The drain tank 32 is connected with the main drain pipe 33 by switching the valve 41. A drain hose 34 is taken off from the drain hose hanger 39. Waste water in the washing tub 2 and the drain tank is drained from the drain hose 34 through the drain pipe 27 and main drain pipe 33 FIG. 5C . Fallen out hair or the like in the waste water is filtrated by a two step filter comprising a rough filter 28 and a fine filter 29. Thereby the waste water can be smoothly drained without clogging the drainage or sewage. When the draining of the water is finished, the drain hose 34 is hanged again to the drain hose hanger 39, as shown in FIG. 5a and the water supply switch 6 is switched to connect the water supply pipe 21 and the branch water supply pipe 21a, and further to connect the drain tank 32 and the circulation water pipe 40.

Next, by turning on the washing switch 5, as shown in FIG. 5B the water supply pressure pump 9 is operated. Thereby, the jet water current is spouted to the washing tub 2 in the same manner as mentioned above, and water in the washing tub 2 is circulated and stirred. Therefore, cleansing agent, bubble and filth which are on the hair of the small animal are washed away. The above mentioned rinse is preferably repeated several times depending on siluation in the same way as mentioned above. And futhermore, rinse agent may be added in the middle of the above mentioned rising. After the rinse and the drainage of water in the washing tub 2 and the drain tank 32 are finished, the heating device 23 is operated by turning on the drying switch 7. Warm air heated by the heater is supplied from respective warm air outlets 17 to the washing tub 2 through the main air supply pipe 24, the distribution pipe 24a and the air pipe 22 and dries the wet hair of the small animal. In the above mentioned embodiment, a continuous rinsing by fresh water happens as following By changing the valves 43, 42 and 41, as shown in FIG. 7, connections of the water supply pipe 21 and the branch water supply pipe 21a, the water circulation pipe 40 and the water supplying pressure pump 19, and of the drain tank 32 and the water circulation pipe 40 are cut off. On the other hand, the water supplying pipe 21, the water supply pressure pump 19, the drain tank 32 and the main drain pipe 33 are respectively connected. The drain hose 34 is put off from the drain hose hanger 39 to prepare the draining of the water. Thereafter, the water supply pressure pump 19 is cleaned. Various kinds of materials, such as wood, plastic, metal or the like can be used for the footing board. If the shape of the footing board guarantees the water passing downwards therethrough, any board such as lattice board, punching board, slatted board can be used for the footing board. Moreover, even wire netting or the like can be used. For material of the main body of the apparatus, metal, plastic and enamelled material or the like can be used. FIG. 8 shows another embodiment of the concrete constitution of water supply and drainage system. The construction of the FIG. 8 is different from the constitution of FIG. 4 where the branch water supplying pipe 21a is divided from the main water supply pipe 18. Further a stop valve 43a is provided in the water supply pipe 21, and a cross valve 42a is provided at a connection part of the branch water supply pipe 21a and the main water supply pipe 18. The water circulation pipe 40 is directly connected to the water supply pressure pump 19 at the part downstream of the valve 43A. In FIG. 8, solid lines show the states of the values of water supplying stage, and drain lines show the washing or rinse stage. And further, the drain line shows the raining water stage. FIG. 9 shows another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, outer shield 50 made of plastic is disposed to the upper part of outer case 1 in a manner to enclose the top part of the outer case 1. The outer shield 50 receives scattered drops of washing water, cleansing agent and hair during the washing of the small animal, and flows them back to the washing tub 2. Therefore, washing water or the like are not scattered out of the apparatus. The outer shield 50 may be covered by outer lid 54 see FIG. 10 . For the outer shield 50, various kind of materials such as plastic, metal or wood can be used. Additionally, a showering device 55 for shampooing the head of the small animal may be provided in the shield 50. FIG. 11 shows a jet water current generation device, where a pulsator 51 is driven by an electric motor 52 through belts 53. It is preferable that one pulsator 51 is disposed on the left side wall of the washing tub 2 the side having the head opening 4a , and one pulsator is disposed in the front and rear wall of the washing tub 2, and one or two pulsators are disposed on the right side wall of the washing tub 2. As mentioned above, in the small animal washing apparatus of the present invention, the small animal is washed and dried automatically in the washing tub 2. Especially, in the present invention, the small animal s body is soaked in the water, and not only aciculum but also fine soft hair can be directly washed and rinsed by the jet water current, and therefore, effects of washing and rinsing of the present invention are more excellent than the conventinal arts wherein animals are washed and rinsed by showered water. Therefore, washing of the small animal does not make trouble, and human clothing and bathroom or the like are not soiled. Further, fallen out hair is not dispersed around the room, and not discharged together with soiled water since they are filtrated by the filter 29 disposed at the drain port 26. Moreover, the apparatus is usable for washing and drying various small animals that are different in their height, since the level or height of the footing board 14 can be adjusted depending on the height of the small animal.
