## Abstract
A record player comprising a deck plate 1 , which carries a turntable 2 , a pick up arm 4 and a pick up arm lifting device 7 which can be moved upwards and down wards. The lifting device 7 comprises an arm support 8 and a lift rod 9 which is integral with said support. The lift rod 9 is guided by a guide element 10 which forms an integral unit with the deck plate. The lift rod 9 comprises a pair of walls 9a, 9b , which make an angle with each other and which cooperate with a pair of guide walls 10a, 10b of the guide element 10 . Between these cooperating walls are damping means which comprise a highly viscous material for damping at least the downward movement of the lifting device 7 . Between the deck plate 1 and the lift rod 9 there is arranged a spring element 16 which exerts on the lift rod 9 there is arranged a spring element 16 which exerts on the lift rod 9 a force F which is directed downwardly towards the line of intersection of the planes of the walls 9a, 9b of the lift rod so as constantly to urge these walls 9a, 9b against the respective guide walls 10a, 10b .
