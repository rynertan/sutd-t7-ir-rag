## Description
The present invention relates to a static semiconductor memory device incorporating redundancy memory cells. In a semiconductor memory device, a large number of memory cells are arranged along rows and columns. The density of defects generated in such a semiconductor memory device during the manufacture thereof is relatively independent of the integration density of the device. Rather, it derives from the semiconductor manufacturing technology. In general, the higher the integration density of the device, the greater the ratio of normal memory cells to defective memory cells. This is one of the advantages of increasing the integration density of a semiconductor memory device. Even if a device includes only one defective memory cell, however, the device cannot be operated normally and, therefore, must be scrapped. As a result, despite the lower ratio of defective memory cells, greater integration density means reduced manufacturing yield. To overcome the problem of defective memory cells, use is made of redundancy redundant memory cells. When a defective memory cell is detected, a redundancy memory cell row or column is selected instead of the memory cell row or column including the defective memory cell. In general, one or two redundancy memory cell rows or columns are usually provided. A problem in the prior art, however, has been that when the defective memory cell has a direct current DC defect, i.e., when the defective memory cell is short circuited, the DC defect itself is not resolved even when a redundancy memory cell row or column is selected. An article by Uchida et al in IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC 17, No. 5, October 1982, pp 804 809, discloses a low power resistive load 64 k bit CMOS RAM having two spare rows of memory cells. Fuse elements are programmed so that a spare decoder selects one of the spare rows instead of a failure row. However, there is no disclosure of the above mentioned problem of a DC defect, and no measure is taken to resolve such a DC defect. An article by Ochii et al in the same journal, pp 798 803, discloses an ultralow power 64 k bit CMOS RAM having spare rows and columns of memory cells. The spare rows or columns are again selected by programming fuses, and in addition, fuses are provided for isolating a failure row electrically by cutting the corresponding power line. However, this necessitates replacing both a failure row and its neighbour by a pair of spare rows so as to complete the power isolation. This is wasteful of spare cell capacity. According to the present invention, there is provided a static semiconductor memory device comprising In an embodiment of the present invention, the potential of a clock signal is applied to loads linked between bit line pairs and a power supply at least during a non selected state stand by state so as to cut off currents flowing through the loads, thereby reducing the load current of bit lines for all memory cells, including a defective memory cell. That is, even when the defective memory cell has a DC defect, power supply currents due to the DC defect are suppressed thereby substantially resolving the DC defect. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, wherein In Fig. 1, which illustrates a prior art static semiconductor memory device, normal static memory cells C Selection of the word lines W₀ , W₁ , ..., W Reference CD₁ designates column decoders, and CD₂ designates a decoder for selecting the redundancy memory cells. The decoder CD₂ is comprised of a resistor R, fuses F Prior to testing of the device of Fig. 1, all the fuses of the decoder CD₂ are in a connected state. Therefore, the gate potentials of the transistors Q In the device of Fig. 1, however, when a direct current DC defect is generated in the interior of a memory cell, the defect itself is not resolved. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the memory cell C₀₀ is comprised of resistors R₁ and R₂ , driver transistors Q₁ and Q₂ , and transfer transistors Q₃ and Q₄. Therefore, when a DC defect is generated so as to short circuit the bit line B₀ or In Fig. 1, note, the power supply voltage V As shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, the above mentioned clock signal pulse signal ø is obtained as an inversion signal of a chip select signal Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C are also timing diagrams for explaining the generation of the clock signal ø of Fig. 3. The clock signal ø as shown in Fig. 6C becomes high for a definite short time period only after the chip select signal The clock signal ø as shown in Fig. 6C can be obtained by a pulse generating circuit PG of Fig. 7. That is, in Fig. 7, the pulse generating circuit PG comprises a plurality of clock pulse generating circuits PG₀ , PG₁ , ..., PG In Fig. 8, which is a detailed logic circuit diagram of one of the clock pulse generating circuits PG Thus, since the bit line load currents are reduced in duration, the power supply currents flowing through a defective memory cell can be reduced, even when the defective memory cell has a DC defect. Therefore, the DC defect can be substantially resolved. In Fig. 10, which illustrates a semiconductor memory device useful for explaining the present invention, fuses F₁₀, For example, when the memory cell C₀₀ is determined to be defective, in the decoder CD₂ , the fuses F In Fig. 11, which illustrates another semiconductor memory device useful for explaining the present invention, fuses F₂₀ , F₂₁ , ..., F For example, when the memory cell C₀₀ is determined to be defective, in the decoder CD₂ , the fuses F Thus, since the power supply V Note that while the above mentioned embodiments relate to static metal oxide semiconductor MOS memory devices, the invention can be applied in the same way to other memory devices, such as static bipolar transistor memory devices.
