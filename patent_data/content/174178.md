# Optical fluid level indicator.

## Abstract
A local display of a fluid level is provided in connection with a fibre optic illuminating system in which a side by side, bi colour light from a source 12, 13, 16 is passed through the fluid in a transparent level gauge 11 . Diverging light passing from the level gauge, refracted in response to the fluid and the material of the gauge is masked and one colour is passed to a focusing lens 18 which focuses the one colour light on an input end 21 of a fibre optic cable 22 and allows peripheral light rays 19 to be passed to a local readout 30 in a plane above or below the focusing lens 18 .
