# Photosensor devices and optical pick ups.

## Abstract
A photosensor device 38 and an optical pick up device 50 incorporating the photosensor device 38 are advan tageously used in an optical compact disc player of the type where the optical pick up device 50 is driven along a path at an acute tilt angle ρ relative to the sides of a rectangular casing 40 . The photosensor device 38 has a plurality of photosensitive elements 3E, etc. aligned in a first direction and a plurality of terminal leads 9 extending parallel to each other and perpendicular to a second direction so that the photosensor 38 may be mounted on a circuit board in a conventional configuration to save space. Within the optical pick up device 50 , the photosensitive elements 3E, etc. are aligned at a mounting angle ϑ which is a function of the tilt angle ρ so that the three optical beams are received thereon in the proper orientation.
