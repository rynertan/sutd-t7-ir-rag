## Abstract
First and second arms 42, 44 are supported, rotatable to each other and in the shape of X, by a shaft 46 . The lower end of the first arm 42 is on the side of a scan gantry 90 and rotatably supported on a base 30 by means of a rotation fulcrum 48 . The lower end of the second arm 44 and upper ends of the first and second arms 42, 44 are supported by base and frame rails 32, 72 through move ment fulcrums 60a, 60b, 60C to be rotatable in relation to and movable along the rails. A tension spring 56 is stretched between the second arm 44 and a mounting frame 70 to urge the mounting frame toward the scan gantry 90 . Stoppers 76, 78 are arranged in the frame rails 72 to prevent the movement fulcrums 60b, 60c of the first and second arms from moving from their predetermined positions in the direction of their separating from the scan gantry. The first arms are rotated and erected by a hydraulic cylinder 36 . The mounting frame 70 is lifted along an arc whose center is the rotation fulcrum, with the first arms 42 contacting the first stoppers 78 , and then vertically lifted, with the second arms 44 contacting the second stoppers 76 .
