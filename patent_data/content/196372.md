# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR CALCINING GYPSUM

## Abstract
An apparatus and process for calcining gypsum is diclosed which utilizes a flash furnace for rapidly calcining fine particulate gypsum while the material is suspended in a stream of hot gas. The method and apparatus utilize a two stage suspension preheater 2 for utilizing waste gases from the calcining furnace 3 for preheating raw material to be calcined and a two stage suspension cooler 4 for cooling hot calcined gypsum which is discharged from the calcining furnace 3 . Spent cooling gas is supplied to the preheater 2 for use in preheating the fresh gypsum to be calcined. The invention also contemplates recirculating a portion of the gypsum discharged from the furnace back to the furnace for further calcination. Hot product may be discharged directly from the furnace.
