# Electroencephalographic system for the quantitative description of patient brain states.

## Abstract
A method and system for the quantitative description of human abnormal brain states, for example, to distinguish cerebral death from a barbiturate induced deep coma, includes an electroencephalograph EEG system utilizing scalp electrodes 10 and amplifiers 11, 12. A computer based system controls a multimodal stimulator 17 clicks, flashes, etc to provide evoked response data for different sensory systems. The ongoing EEG and averaged response data are processed quantitatively and compared with previously stored normative data, describing brain states in patients free of head trauma, to calculate a set of Z transformations. The Z transormations define Z, the brain state vector BSV , which may be visually displayed, for example, on a cathode ray tube 48. The length, direction and change of BSV over time provide an evaluation of the anatomical location of any damage, the severity of functional impairment and the rate of improve ment or deterioration of the patients s state in order to aid in selection and guidance of treatment.
