# Process for the production of bis N,N dialkylamino alkyl ethers and the use of said ethers.

## Abstract
Bis N,N dialkylamino alkyl ethers are produced by reacting a N,N dialkylamino alkanol over a heterogeneous solid acid catalyst. The N,N dialkylamino alkanol can optionally be accompanied by an inert carrier. The resulting bis ethers are useful as catalysts in the production of polyurethanes, especially cellular polyurethanes.
