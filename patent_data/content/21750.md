# Production of spherically shaped material made of chitin derivative.

## Abstract
Previous problems associated with processing acylated de N acetylated chitin into a desired shape can be overcome by contacting an aqueous solution of a de N acetylated chitin or a salt thereof with a liquid containing an organic acid anhydride and a suspending agent in such a manner as to produce materials in the desired shape having an outer surface layer of the acylated de N acetylated chitin. The interior of the materials may comprise the de N acetylated chitin or its salt or may consist entirely or almost entirely of the acylated product. The material may be spherical or in the form of fibres. The acylated outer surface is insoluble in water, acids, alkaline solutions and organic solvents. The materials can be employed as an adsorbent, for example to separate materials on a column, or as a base material on which an enzyme, antibody or antigen is immobilized.
