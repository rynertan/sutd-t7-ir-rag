# Phase detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A phase detecting apparatus comprises a first PLL and a second PLL having a response time shorter than the re sponse time of the first PLL. An AC voltage signal produced by the first PLL which is in phase with the detected AC volt age except until the expiration of the response time of the first PLL after an abrupt change in the phase of the detected AC voltage is normally applied to the second PLL. Until ex piration of the response time of the first PLL after rising of the detected AC voltage to a certain level, the detected AC voltage is applied, in place of the AC voltage signal produc ed by the first PLL, to the second PLL. The second PLL pro vides a digital signal indicative of the phase of the detected AC voltage.
