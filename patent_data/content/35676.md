## Description
Improved Peanut Products and Methods for Making SameBackground for the InventionMy invention relates to improved peanut products and new processes for making such products. More specifically, my invention relates to water soluble, odorless and tasteless peanut products and processes for making such products.Protein is a vital builder of the human body. However, conventional sources of protein such as meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products are being severely strained by the population explosion. It is well known that peanuts the term peanuts as used herein includes equivalent nut meats even if commonly referred to by different names are high in nutritive value, especially in protein.It is highly desirable to obtain peanut products which are odorless and tasteless because the impurities and inherent odor of peanuts are often objectionable in many applications.In addition, it is also often desirable to have a watersoluble product. Peanuts, even after they are pulverized, are not naturally water soluble and so additional processing is required to obtain a water soluble product.Akihiro Matsunaga invented processes for making peanut flour which are the subjects of United States Patent Nos.3,829,589 and 3,901,983. Matsunaga s basic process may be very briefly summarized as follows washing blanched, skinned peanuts in a saline bath rinsing them precooking them rinsing again pressure cooking grinding and then spray drying. Naturally, further details and additional steps are involved and the aforementioned patents should be consulted if further information is desired. Other examples of ti peanut processing art are to be found in United States Patent Nos. 4,113,889 Baxley , 4,025,658 Pominski et al , 3,928,635 Ohta et al , 3,800,056 Mitchell , and 617,266 Watson .These and other prior processes involved inefficiencies and problems I sought to avoid. For example, some of these processes require the use of spray dryers in the final step of making the flour.Because of the fairly high fat content of peanuts there is from time to time the threat of serious fires developing in the spray dryers. In addition, in order for typical spray dryers to operate properly, the peanut material fed into them must havea minimum water to solid ratio of about 65 to 35 by weight, and more often higher.However, the cooking steps preceding the drying steps of, for example Matsunaga s processes, are more efficiently conducted with a lower amount of water because one wishes to cook the peanuts and not expend energy on heating water instead. Therefor, in practicing these processes one is often forced to add water after cooking and prior to spray drying only to have that water removed during drying, which seemed to me to be an inefficiency to somehow be avoided.Although water soluble, odorless and tasteless peanut flour may be produced by prior art methods, flour is sometimes an inconvenient form for many applications. For example, flour and other powdery products are rather unappetizing to eat by themselves. In addition, flour and the like are messy to handle when one wishes to use it directly as an animal feed.Summary of the InventionMy method of processing peanuts has the advantages of improved energy efficiency and safety. The difficulties inherent in spray drying are avoided. In addition, because of water recycling, there is less waste of the inherent nutritional value of the peanuts. Peanut products of my invention include products in appetizing and convenient forms. In addition, they enjoy long shelf lives.My method of processing peanuts features the making of a mash by grinding a mixture of water and peanuts which have been pretreated to remove tannin, odor and impurities, the partial dewatering of the mash to form a dough, the dividing of the dough into pieces, and the drying of the pieces.Preferably, water removed during the partial dewatering step is recycled for use in the pretreating of peanuts. The partial dewatering step yields a dough with sufficient moisture such that the product can retain its shape after the dividing and drying steps are completed. Provision is made for the addition of starch at different points in the process in order to obtain a product with improved shelf life, and also for the removal of peanut oil in order to obtain a product with reduced fat content. Color of the product is controlled during the drying step as well as during blanching of peanuts. The product of the process can be further ground into flour.The product of my invention includes a water soluble peanut product in the form of nonpowdery pieces which contain enough water to hold their shapes. This product is made from unreconstituted peanut dough, that is, it is made from peanuts which have never been reduced to a flour like form.Brief Description of the DrawingsFigure 1 is a block diagram showing a preferred embodiment of the process according to my invention.Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsThe initial steps of the process according to my invention are preferably similar to the initial steps of Matsulaga s method of making peanut flour described in United StatesPatent No. 3,829,589, which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably the initial steps of my process are as follows gently parching shelled peanuts at a temperature of 500C to 900C for 3 to 6 minutes and then removing the skins soaking the skinned peanuts in a saline solution for approximately 30 seconds to 5 minutes at a temperature of 0 0 about 20 C to 50 C preheating the peanuts in water at a temperature of about 700C to 1000C for 1 to 5 minutes washing the peanuts in water and then pressure cooking in water at a temperature of about 1200C for 15 to 30 minutes.It will be noted that the preheating time of 1 to 5 minutes according to my invention is substantially less than the 15 to 45 minutes suggested in the aforementioned patent toMatsunaga. After these initial steps one has a mixture of water and pretreated peanuts. For convenience, peanuts which have gone through all these or equivalent steps are hereinafter referred to as pretreated peanuts. The purpose of this pretreatment is to remove tannin, odor and other impurities. Peanuts which have gone through the first two steps that is, the parching and saline soaking steps are for convenience referred to as partially preprocessed peanuts. It should be appreciated that although in its preferred embodiments my invention involves peanuts which have been pretreated as already described, my invention includes the use of pretreated peanuts which have been pretreated by any other method which substantially removes the tannin, odor, and impurities of the peanuts. Furthermore, the pretreated peanuts must be mixed with water in order that the material eventually be at.the level of moisture specified below for the peanut dough. During pressure cooking a large amount of water, typically at least about one to one and one half times as much water as peanuts by weight, is used and most of this water is absorbed by the peanuts. In addition, efficient operation of a grinder generally requires an even greater amount of water than is necessary for the peanut dough.From this point on my process differs substantially fromMatsunaga s process. In Matsunaga s process the mixture of water and pretreated peanuts is compressed and pulverized to micronized form so as to be able to pass through a 300 mesh screen. In my process the mixture of water and pretreated peanuts is then ground to form a mash however, particles of the mash need not be, although they may be, so small as to pass through a 300 mesh screen.Referring now to Figure 1, the process according to my invention proceeds by feeding the mixture of water and pretreated peanuts into a grinder 1 where the mixture is ground into a mash. Additional water may be added during the grinding step in order to facilitate the grinding and also to raise the moisture level of the resulting mash. Optionnally, one may add high grade starch, such as corn starch or potato starch, during this grinding step. The purpose of the added starch is to lengthen the shelf life of the final product.The mash is removed from the grinder 1 and sent to a dewatering device 2 where the mash is turned into a dough.This dewatering device may consist o a mechanical device such as a centrifugal machine or, less preferably, a simple mechanical press. Optionally, the mash is sent to a predryer 3 after the dewatering device 2. This predryer may consist of any suitable form of heating device such as an oven. One also has the option of not using any mechanical dewatering device at all, and instead only using a heattype dryer. No matter what sort of dewatering device or dryer is used during this partial dewatering step, the object is to turn the mash which contains too ntuch water into a dough which can retain its shape after subsequent dividing and drying steps described below.The preferred water content of the dough at the end of this partial dewatering step is in the range of about 20 50 water by weight and more preferably in the range of about 25 35 . If the water content is much too high, the dough will be runny and will not form into pieces. If the water content is somewhat too high, the pieces made during the subsequent dividing step will stick to each other while drying.Optionally, the water removed during the partial dewatering step is recycled back to a pressure cooker for use in the earlier pretreating steps for subsequent peanuts. This water is useful because of its high protein content. It can be appreciated that at least part of the partial dewatering step preferably be done by mechanical means because it is easy to reclaim the high protein water from a mechanical dewaterer, whereas a condenser or other additional devices would be required to recover the water removed by a heating type of drying device.The dough made during the partial dewatering step is next fed into a divider 4 where the step of dividing the dough into pieces takes place. It should be understood that the dividing step may be effected by an assortment of means, including various extrusion devices. One device suitable for this dividing step is a granulator having a pair of opposing rollers. One roller has a smooth surface. The other roller has a series of grooves. Preferably, the rollers are in contact with each other. The peanut mash having a proper water content passes between these two rollers where it is divided into a series of strands. These strands fall onto a moving conveyor belt, breaking into small irregular pieces in the process.Optionally, the rollers of the granulator itself are heated so as to raise the temperature of the dough to a temperature in the range of preferably about 650 0 to 120 C during the dividing step. This helps to speed up the drying of the pieces of dough. After the grinding step and before the dividing that is, before, during or after the partial dewatering step, preferably, just before dewatering one has the option of removing some or substantially all of the peanut oil. This can be accomplished, for example, by using centrifugal separating techniques, which are preferable to techniques which involve mechanically squeezing the oil out. One utilizes this additional deoiling step in order to obtain a low or no fat final product. It also yields peanut oil as an additional product of the process. The dough made with such lesser amounts of peanut oil preferably has a somewhat higher water content than dough that has nob been deoiled, all other conditions remaining essentially the same.After the dividing step one once again has the option of adding high grade or other types of starch to the pieces of dough. For example, the pieces may be covered with a thin shell of starch. As stated earlier, this added starch helps to lengthen the shelf life of the final product.The pieces of dough are then sent to a dryer 5. Preferably, the dryer is an oven in which the pieces of dough are carried through a predetermined temperature range in which the initial temperatures are higher than the terminal temperatures. Most preferably the initial temperature is about 1500C and the final temperature of the oven is about 500C.The time spent in the oven during this drying step is preferably in the range of about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temperature range and speed of the dryer. For example, the dryer may comprise an oven containing a conveyor belt which carries the pieces of dough past a series of radiant heaters. The intitial radiant heaters are at a higher thermointensity than the later ones. The temperature range is controlled by varying the intensity of the heating elements, the speed of the conveyor, and the length of the oven. By varying the temperature in the oven and the time spent in the oven, the color of the final product may be varied from between a creamy white to a dark brown depending on the final application desired.The dividing and drying steps can take place in the same device. For example, the strands of divided peanut dough can fall directly into a rotary type dryer or a fluid bed type dryer rather than be carried from the divider to the dryer.The product of the foregoing process is water soluble, odorless and tasteless. Preferably the water content of the final product is in the range of about 3 to 6 by weight.Preferably, the final product contains about 5 10 starch by weight, although the added starch is not always necessary.The final product is not in a form of a flour or powder, rather in much larger pieces. The size of the pieces may be varied from rather small granules to larger irregularly or regularly shaped pellets. The pieces do not fall apart because they contain a sufficient amount of water to maintain their shape, in other words the pieces have a shapesustaining effective amount of water. Thus, they are more appetizing for consumption because they can be chewed, whereas trying to eat dust like substances like flour is un appetizing. In addition, pellet like forms of the product are especially useful in animal feed or additions to animal feed because they can be more easily handled than powdery forms of products. It should be further appreciated that the product obtaind from the final drying step in my process is made from unreconstituted peanut dough. By unreconstituted Imean th the dough is not formed by first turning the peanuts ins,, flour and then adding water . Instead, the need of making flour is entirely avoided. Indeed, it has been my zxi,eri ence that a product made from reconstituted peanut dough that is, dough made by mixing peanut flour and water can have an unpleasant flavor which makes it undesirable for human consumption.If one desires a flour like consistency in the final product, the pieces obtained from the final drying step can be further ground into finer granules or even into powder.It should be appreciated that even where the final product desired is a flour like substance, the method according to my invention is superior to prior art processes. For example, water need not be added prior to the drying step in order to operate spray dryers. In addition, the fire hazard during the handling is substantially reduced. Furthermore, some or all of the water removed during the partial dewatering step of my invention may be recycled for use in the earlier cooking step. Thus the high protein content of this water is not wasted.The invention may be summarized as follows 1.
