# Apparatus for holding boxes in attachment of same to separable slide fastener chain with box pin and insertion pin.

## Abstract
A box holder 25 vertically movably mounted on a frame 26 is reciprocably movable between a box attaching position and a box receiving position. The box holder 25 includes a recess for receiving a box 20 and a clamp finger 32 for retaining the box 20 in the recess 31 . The clamp finger 32 is pivotably mounted on a slide block 34 vertically movably disposed in a recessed portion 30 defined in the box holder adjacent to the recess. The box holder 25 further includes a cam 38 facing the recessed portion 30 and a cam folower 37 provided on the clamp finger 32 . Upon vertical movement of the slide block 34 , the cam follower 37 is brought into engagement with the cam 38 to cause the clamp finger 32 to angularly move toward and away from the recess 31 , thereby releasably retaining the box 20 in the recess. The box holder 25 thus constructed is compact in structure and reliable in operation.
