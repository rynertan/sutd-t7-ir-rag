## Abstract
Light guiding plates 14b, 14c integral with a transpa rent plate 14 of a dial board 12 are each formed with a light reflecting surface 30, 32 which is such construc ted that the light entering the light guiding plate 14b, 14c is reflected by the light reflecting surface 30, 32 for focussing of the light in the vicinity of an opening 18 of the dial board 12 through which a spindle 20 of a movement passes. Light is reflected by boundary sur faces 18a, 18b of the opening 18 into the hub section of a transparent pointer 22 carried by the spindle 20 . The hub section of the pointer 22 has a reflecting sur face 22a to reflect the light towards the end of the poin ter 22 .
