# Interpolating filter arrangement with irrational ratio between the input and the output sampling frequencies.

## Abstract
Interpolating time discrete filter arrangement for in creasing the sampling frequency of a time discrete signal from f Herein the function h v represents the impulse response of a FIR filter and v a continuous variable in the interval x v x.
