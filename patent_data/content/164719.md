## Description
Proteases or peptidases have a wide range of activities, functions and specificities The naturally occurring human α₁ antitrypsin has a methionine at the active site for inhibition of many serine proteases, particularly elastase. Oxidation of the methionine to the sulfoxide substantially inactivates the inhibitory activity towards most serine proteases, but not human chymotrypsin. The ability to inhibit an enzyme, either reversibly or irreversibly, has a wide variety of applications. For therapeutic purposes, the ability to protect a host from the degradative effects of elastase can provide protection from the diseases indicated above. In Partial nucleotide sequences of α₁ antitrypsin have been reported by Kurachi EP A 0 155 188 describes α₁ antitrypsin mutants produced in bacteria and yeast wherein the active methionine is replaced with alanine, valine, glycine, phenylalanine, arginine or lysine. McRae Novel polypeptide serine protease inhibitors are provided, demonstrating enhanced storage and oxidative stability with high levels of inhibition. Efficient production of the inhibitors is obtained in yeast, particularly hybrid yeast strains, where the polypeptide inhibitors may be isolated, purified and employed in a variety of ways. Novel DNA constructs are provided for expression of novel serine peptidase inhibitors which find use in The polypeptide products of the subject invention may be glycosylated or non glycosylated, usually non glycosylated and are available using hybrid constructs involving combining DNA sequences from diverse sources. Hybrid polypeptides may be prepared which will generally range from about 350 to 500 amino acids. These polypeptides will, except for the modification of the methionine residue, retain the α₁ antitrypsin sequence for an oligopeptide sequence of at least about 10 amino acids, usually at least about 40 amino acids, and more usually at least about 80 amino acids, which sequence includes the active site of α₁ antitrypsin and at least five amino acids flanking both sides of the active site. Where using the numbering of α₁ antitrypsin as indicated in the Experimental, this will involve amino acids 290 to 394, more usually 310 to 390 and particularly 340 to 380. The non α₁ antitrypsin residues may be employed for immunogenic purposes, for modifying the characteristic of the inhibitory properties, or to provide a plurality of activities. Fragments may also find use, particularly fragments involving at least about 20 amino acids, more usually at least about 30 amino acids, and preferably at least about 50 amino acids, and not more than about 200 amino acids where the fragments include the active site and for the most part the naturally occurring amino acids on each side of the active site, generally at least about ten amino acids on each side, more usually at least about 15 amino acids on each side, where the amino acids do not differ by more than ten number percent, more usually by not more than about five number percent from the wild type sequence provided in the Experimental section. It should be understood that to the extent that naturally occurring alleles have been already isolated or may be isolated in the future, those sites in α₁ antitrypsin where allelic variation is observed may also be varied in the subject polypeptides. Particularly, the residues of the sequence in the Experimental differing from those residues described by Carrell The DNA and polypeptide sequences of particular interest are set forth in the Experimental section, where the modified active site is indicated. The substitution at the active site will be an oxidative resistant L amino acid of from three to six carbon atoms, preferably of from four to five carbon atoms, where the side chain may be hydrocarbon or hydroxy substituted hydrocarbon, preferably hydrocarbon, including alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, and threonine, particularly valine. The DNA constructs which are employed will usually involve an extrachromosomal element having a replication system recognized by at least one unicellular microorganism, such as a bacterium, e.g., The replication system may be obtained from either plasmids or viruses and may be derived from such plasmids as ColE1, e.g., pBR322, R plasmid, e.g., pRK290, 2µm plasmid, pJDB219, YEp4, YEp24, etc. Many of the replication systems are generally available and have been extensively described in the literature. Usually the replication system will be available in combination with from zero to three, more usually from one to three genetic markers, structural genes which allow for selection of the host containing the replication system and marker, which combination will be referred to as a vector. The markers may allow for selection in one or more hosts or different markers may be used for the different hosts. The markers conveniently include biocide resistance, e.g., antibiotic resistance to streptomycin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, tunicamycin, kanamycin, etc. heavy metals, e.g., mercury and copper toxins, e.g., colicin immunity prototrophy in an auxotrophic host, e.g., uracil, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, etc. In addition, there will be transcriptional and translational initiation and termination regulatory sequences. These sequences may be available from a wide variety of genes, where the untranslated upstream and downstream domains or regions may be employed as a source for the necessary regulatory sequences. Of particular interest is the use of yeast as a host, where various transcriptional initiation regions may be employed, such as the transcriptional initiation regions of yeast glycolytic enzymes, e.g., glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, phosphoglucoisomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerokinase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, or the like acid phosphatase galactokinase heat shock proteins metallothionein etc. The regions will generally range from about 200 to 1000bp, more usually about 200 to 600bp, and may extend into the coding region of the particular structural gene associated with the transcriptional initiation region. To that extent, the 5 terminus of the peptidase inhibitor structural gene may include from zero to ten, more usually from zero to five, conveniently one to three codons of the structural gene associated with the regulatory region. Since the first codon will be the methionine initiation codon, the difference between the subject peptidase inhibitors and the wild type peptidase inhibitors will involve the substitution of the first codon for methionine or presence of one or more codons, usually not more than about five, inserted between the methionine initiation codon and the second codon of the wild type peptidase inhibitor α₁ antitrypsin. The transcriptional initiation region will normally include the sequences necessary for translational initiation as well. Thus, by employing the region involving transcriptional initiation, one also provides for translational initiation and expression. The transcriptional initiation region can be selected or modified, so as to be constitutive or regulated. Thus, one can choose a promoter which provides for constitutive transcription of the structural gene. Alternatively, one can select a promoter or modify a promoter to provide for induced or controlled expression of the structural gene. The promoter region of yeast glycolytic enzymes structural genes, as well as other structural genes, appears to be divided into two domains, one domain proximal to the structural gene which involves the binding of RNA polymerase and initiation of transcription, and a second domain distal to the structural gene which provides for enhanced efficiency of transcription and or regulation. Therefore, by modifying the nucleotides beginning at about from about 300 to 500 nucleotides upstream from the initiation of the structural gene and extending at least to 200 nucleotides and usually 300 nucleotides or more in the upstream direction, one can modify the manner of expression. Thus, one can introduce at this site, sequences associated with regulation, such as the regulatory regions for such structural genes as GAL1, PHO5, or GAL10 or one can use temperature sensitive regulatory regions, which regions may include the RNA polymerase binding domain. With these regions, one would employ a host which had the associated mechanism for regulation of the particular region. The termination region will be at least about 200 nucleotides and may be 300 or more and can be conveniently derived from the same structural gene as the promoter or a different structural gene. It is found that the termination region and initiation regions should be balanced, since strong promoters appear to require strong terminators for efficacy. Therefore, for the most part, terminators will be chosen from structural genes which have similar levels of expression in the host as the structural gene associated with the transcriptional initiation region. Where a cassette is available providing for transcriptional initiation and termination and one or more restriction sites intermediate the two regions, the subject structural genes may be inserted downstream from the transcriptional and translational initiation region, so as to be under the regulatory control of this domain, and followed by the termination region. Alternatively, one can join the various fragments to provide a construct comprising the transcriptional and translational initiation region, the structural gene having its initiation codon, and the transcriptional and translational termination region, which may then be introduced into an appropriate site of a vector having the appropriate replication system s and markers. In order to provide for the modified polypeptides of the subject invention, a variety of techniques may be employed for providing the varied codons necessary for producing the modified polypeptide. One technique is Instead of using The final construct will include from one to two replication systems of different unicellular microorganisms, e.g., bacterial and yeast from zero to three markers, preferably from one to two markers, at least one common marker or one marker for each host for each replication system, and a cassette comprising a transcriptional initiation regulatory domain, followed downstream in the direction of transcription by the structural gene encoding for the modified serine peptidase inhibitor, followed by an appropriate termination system. This construct may then be used for introduction into an appropriate host, e.g., yeast. A suitable yeast host may be obtained by crossing different strains of Of particular interest as the host is a cross between two strains, employing the common fermenting strain In addition to the other functional sequences, as noted above, one or more genetic markers may be employed for selection and maintenance of the yeast strain. These markers may provide for protection from a biocide, e.g., antibiotic, toxin, or heavy metal provide prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, e.g., the amino acid Various techniques are available for transforming the host with the DNA construct, where spheroplasts may be employed with polyethylene glycol precipitated DNA, conjugation, transfection, transduction, or the like. See, for example, Hinnen The modified yeast host is then grown in an appropriate nutrient medium to provide for expression of the desired polypeptide. Conventional rich nutrient media may be used or any other medium in which yeast can be satisfactorily grown, lacking the appropriate metabolite s . For induced expression, the host will be grown to high density under conditions where expression of the polypeptide is not induced and when the desired cell density is achieved, the conditions will be changed to induce expression. For constitutive expression, the host will be grown in a rich medium to ensure efficient production of the desired polypeptide. After sufficient time for the polypeptide to be produced, the cells may be isolated, lysed by any convenient means, e.g., mechanical shearing or detergent, and the polypeptide of interest isolated and purified by conventional techniques, e.g., chromatography, such as affinity chromatography, electrophoresis, density gradient, crystallization, ultrafiltration, or the like. Where the polypeptide is secreted, the cells may be separated from the supernatant and the supernatant treated as described above. Of particular interest is the use of the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase or pyruvate kinase promoter regions having the RNA polymerase binding site and the transcription initiation site. In conjunction with these promoter regions or proximal domains are desirably used for regulated expression, the GAL4 regulator region or the PHO5 regulator region or a temperature sensitive regulator region. The terminator region may be derived from any convenient structural gene, particularly the glycolytic enzyme genes. While the exemplified construct does not involve the use of a leader sequence allowing for secretion, such a construct could be produced whereby the peptidase inhibitor would be secreted and isolated from the nutrient medium. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,336,336 4,338,397 and 4,411,994. See also U.S. patent application Serial No. 522,909, filed August 12, 1983. By employing the constructions of the subject invention, polypeptides may be produced in amounts usually at least about 1 of total soluble protein, more usually at least 2 of total soluble protein, and frequently at least 5 or higher. Where amounts of about 25 or higher of total soluble protein are attainable, the total soluble protein being the sum of total host and expression product soluble protein. The subject serine peptidase inhibitors are shown to have specific inhibitory activity toward elastase, as well as inhibitory activity toward other serine peptidases. The compositions have a minimum activity as compared to conventional elastase assays where inhibition by human α₁ antitrypsin is being measured of at least 25 , usually at least 35 , and desirably at least 50 of the α₁ antitrypsin Met . The compositions are resistant to oxidation as compared to the naturally occurring active site containing methionine. For use in The subject compositions can be used for affinity chromatography for isolating leukocyte elastase, by binding the subject compositions to an appropriate solid substrate, which may then be used in a column. Samples suspected of containing elastase may then be introduced into the column and eluted. By adding strong nucleophiles e.g., hydroxylamine or hydrazine to the eluting solution, the complex between the elastase and the subject serine peptidase inhibitors may be broken and the elastase eluted. Alternatively, various assays may be devised, whereby conjugating the subject inhibitors with a haptenic ligand of interest, the resulting conjugate may still retain inhibitory activity, which is lost when antibody to the hapten binds to the conjugate. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. All DNA manipulations were done according to standard procedures. See A cDNA library was made from 10µg of polyA RNA isolated from a part of a human liver. Unless otherwise indicated α₁ antitrypsin is from a human source. This library was prepared by oligo dT priming of the first cDNA strand and self priming of the second cDNA strand. The ds cDNA was size fractionated on a Sepharose CL4B column and those molecules greater than 300bp isolated. This fraction was treated with nuclease S1 and tailed with dCTP, using terminal transferase. The tailed cDNA was annealed to pBR322 which had been digested with Two synthetic oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate the alpha 1 antitrypsin α₁ AT cDNA, the first probe corresponding to amino acid residues 344 350 near the C terminus of the protein was used to probe 5,000 colonies and the second probe, corresponding to amino acid residues 23 to 17 1 being the first nucleotide of the first codon of the mature α₁ AT of the signal peptide, was used to probe 25,000 colonies. The probe sequences were taken from the partial nucleotide sequence described by Kurachi The entire sequence of a composite full length cDNA derived from the three plasmids is as follows Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of α₁ AT cDNA. The reactive center met ser at positions 358 359 is boxed. Subscripts to amino acids in parentheses identify differences between the subject protein sequence and those derived from a protein sequencing Carrell The above sequence was determined using the dideoxy sequencing method of Sanger Construction of the full length clone for expression of yeast began with three fragments isolated from cDNA clones 1 a 630bp Approximately two pmoles of fragments 1 and 2 were ligated together and after removal of the ligase, digested with A yeast expression vector was prepared called pPGAP having a polyrestriction site linker between the GAPDH terminator and a truncated GAPDH promoter region. Plasmids pGAP2 and pGAP1 were obtained as follows A yeast gene library was prepared by inserting fragments obtained after partial digestion of total yeast DNA with restriction endonuclease into pBR322 as an and containing 26 to 1bp of the GAPDH promoter and an The resulting pBR322 was digested with Plasmid pPGAP was digested with The plasmids pC1 1GAPATi8 and pC1 1GAPATi9 also referred to herein as pC1 1GAPATi Met were obtained with the orientation of expression clockwise in the former and counterclockwise in the latter, with Assays contained in 1ml 0.1 0.2 human leukocyte elastase HLE 0.1mM MeO Suc Ala Ala Pro Val The above data demonstrate that plasmids having the orientation of the expression cassette in the counterclockwise orientation, the promoter proximal to the long sequence of pBR322, make 10 20 times more α₁ AT than the same cassette in the other orientation. Yeast strain It is evident from the above results, that by employing a robust brewer s yeast The Yeast expression plasmids containing the mutant α₁ antitrypsin gene pC1 1PHO5ATi Val or the wild type α₁ antitrypsin gene pC1 1PHO5ATi Met under control of the PHO5 promoter and GAPDH terminator were constructed. Plasmid pC1 1PHO5ATi Val was constructed as follows. A 360bp Plasmid pC1 1PHO5ATi Met was constructed as follows. The Plasmid pPHO5ATi was obtained as follows. The PHO5 gene was isolated from a yeast genomic library employing an oligonucleotide probe Plasmid pPGAP was constructed as described under construction of pC1 1GAPATi Val and pC1 1GAPATi Met . Plasmid pC1 1 is a derivative of pJDB219 Beggs, The plasmid pC1 1PHO5ATi Val was transformed in Yeast expression plasmids containing the mutant α₁ antitrypsin gene pC1 1GAPATi Val under control of the GAPDH promoter and terminator were constructed. Plasmid pC1 1GAPATi Val was constructed as follows. A 600bp fragment corresponding to the 5 end of the α₁ antitrypsin gene was obtained by digesting pPGAPATi with Plasmid pC1 1GAPATi Val was transformed in A yeast expression plasmid containing a different mutant α₁ antitrypsin gene pC1 1GAPATi Ala Pst under control of the GAPDH promoter and terminator was constructed. The plasmid was prepared essentially as described above for the other mutants, except that a Pst site was first incorporated 5 of Met₃₅₈ in the α₁ antitrypsin gene. The PstI site was added by M13 oligonucleotide site specific mutagenesis utilizing the following sequence as primer This modified sequence was then cloned into pGAP. Thereafter, this plasmid was digested with PstI and SalI, yielding a fragment containing the 5 end of α₁ antitrypsin, the GAP promoter region and 280 bp of pC1 1. This fragment was isolated by gel electrophoresis. Separately, the pC1 1GAPATi Met plasmid was digested with AvaI and the following kinased 40 48 mer containing an alanine codon GCT in place of the methionine codon at equivalent position 358 in the α₁ antitrypsin gene was ligated to it. The linear fragment so produced was subsequently digested with BamH1, yielding a PstI BamH1 fragment containing the 3 end of α₁ antitrypsin as well as the GAP terminator. This fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and along with the other purified fragment was ligated into BamH1 SalI digested pC1 1, yielding pC1 1GAPATi Ala Pst . Yeast extracts were prepared by lysis with glass beads and centrifuged to remove cell debris Valenzuela To determine the anti elastase activities of the mutant Val or wild type Met α₁ antitrypsin, appropriate yeast extracts were incubated with HLE and the synthetic peptide as described previously. Specifically for the assay, extracts were diluted in 50mM Tris pH8, 50mM NaCl. Aliquots were transferred to tubes containing 0.1mM Meo Suc Ala Ala Pro Val To determine if the valine α₁ antitrypsin was oxidation resistant, extracts were treated with N chlorosuccinimide NCS which converts susceptible methionines to their sulphoxides Johnson and Travis, Table 2 and Table 3 show results obtained with wild type Met or mutant Val α₁ antitrypsin using pC1 1PHO5ATi vectors and pC1 1GAPATi vectors, respectively. Similar assays utilizing extracts from yeast transformed with the pC1 1GAPATi Ala Pst plasmid gave comparable results, indicating the retention of activity of the mutant Ala α₁ antitrypsin. It is evident from the above results, that the subject modified polypeptides are effective inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase and strongly complex with the elastase. The subject proteins can therefore find a wide variety of applications. Due to the substantially enhanced resistance to oxidation, as evidenced by the reaction with the N chloro succinimide with retention of activity, the subject compounds can find use in commercial applications, such as affinity chromatography. Furthermore, by virtue of their enhanced stability Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
