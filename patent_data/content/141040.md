# A device with a rolling bearing.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a device with a journal 1 com prising an angular contact raceway for a row of rolling mem bers in a rolling bearing arrangement, e.g. in a conveyor roller. In order to provide a bearing with a good load carrying capacity in a simplified and inexpensive way, the journal is provided with two annular grooves 15, 16 made by a plastic forming operation with a tool which is pressed against the surface of the journal, an annular protrusion 14 with a grea ter circumference than the original circumference of the jour nal being formed between the grooves, the side of the protru sion facing the middle portion of the journal having a surface which, together with one of the grooves, constitutes a race way for rolling members 17 .

## Description
A DEVICE WITH A ROLLING BEARINGThe invention concerns a device with a rolling bearing on a journal comprising an angular contact raceway for a row of rolling elements,In erg, roller conveyors each roller is usually mounted on a journal in two bearings, The roller with the bearings is thereby made of a comparatively large number of parts, which makes the device complicated and expensive. Thus, the shaft is to be provided with two bearing inner rings which have to be mounted and fixed to the journal in a suitable manner, e.g. with locking rings which require grooves in the journal surface. It is known to form raceways by cutting operations directly into the surface of a massive or thick walled journal,Such massive or thick walled journals are often required in order to obtain a sufficient strength for a given diameter.Cutting operations are, however, detrimental to the strength of the journal, and the diameters of the raceways made in this way are always smaller than the diameter of the journal, which limits the load carrying capacity of the bearing.The object of the present invention is to provide a device of the kind specified above, which comprises few parts which can be manufactured and assembled at low cost and in which the bearing has an improved load carrying capacity.This object is obtained by making the device in accordance with the characterizing features stated in claim 1, Suitable embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.A device according to the invention is preferably used for mounting a conveyor roller in bearings, The arrangement can be made in a simple and inexpensive manner with few components, and the bearing can be effectively sealed. The journal which forms a portion of the device can be easily and quickly shaped with a high precision and the shaping operation results in an improved load carrying capacity and strength, Whe following is a detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which figure 1 and figure 2 show axial sections of portions of two embodiments of the invention.Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the invention in an area at one end of the journal. The area at the other end is preferably made in a corresponding way. The device comprises a conventional outer ring 10 provided in a bearing seat in a surrounding element 11, A sealing member 12 is provided outside of the bearing ring. The journal 13 is massive, and an annular protrusion 14 is formed around the Journal, e,g, by pressing a number of rollers shaped with two convex annular portions against and around the journal, whereby two parallel grooves 15,16 are formed in the journal surface. Material of the journal thereby flows together between the grooves and is pressed radially outwards, forming a flange ljke portion, which makes the protrusion 14.The grooves 15,16 constitute a raceway and a counter surface for rolling elements 17 and a sealing member 12, respectively. By the fact that the protrusion 14 has a greater diameter than the journal the raceway in the groove 15 has a greater diameter than a raceway would have if it was made in the usual manner with cutting operations, such as turning and grinding, in the journal surface. The forming operation thus gives to the bearing an improved load carrying capacity. The grooves made in the manner described have a surface finish which makes them suitable as raceways and as sealing surfaces for a rubbing seal w thout further treatment, and the forming operation results in a structure of the journal material which improves hardness and fatigue strength, whereby suitable raceways for rolling bearings are obtained. Figure 2 shows an end portion of Ã…a device according to another embodiment of the invention, According to this embodiment there are two protrusions 18,19 formed in a massive Journal 20 by e.g. pressing with rollers forming three convex annular portions, whereby three grooves 21 22,23 with intermediate protrusions 18,19 are formed in a manner corresponding to what has been described in connection to figure 1. The second protrusion can be used as an abutment for positioning the journal 20 in e.g. a roller stand 24 in which a number of conveyor rollers are arranged.The invention is useful also in other applications than conveyor rollers, e,g. wheels and rollers for transport carriages and trucks and for mounting other rotatable objects in bearings
