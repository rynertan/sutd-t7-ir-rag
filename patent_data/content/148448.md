# ETCHING METHOD

## Abstract
Focused ion beams 4 are implanted in the substrate 2 , and a treatment method in which the etching rate varies with the ion concentration is subsequently applied thereto, whereby it is made possible to produce etching holes 5 hav ing various sectional patterns or even a tunnel shaped etching 51 in the substrate. It is also possible to produce patterns projected on the substrate. The present method is arranged so that the doping and the etching are self aligned with each other, and therefore it is fit for precision work and is very useful for highly integrating a semiconductor device.
