# PROCESS FOR FORMING METALLIC ARTICLES AND CASTINGS USED THEREIN

## Abstract
A process for forming a metalic article such as a fluid actuated ram assembly and particularly a hydraulically actuated ram assembly which includes as an initial step production of a raw casting from a mould. Subsequently one or more transverse parting operations are effected to the casting so as to form components of the article which may subsequently be attached to form the article. Suitably the raw casting is mounted on a lathe for various machining operations to be effected prior to carrying out the parting operations There s also provided a raw casting which has a rear portion having a bifurcated end as well as front portion having a bifurcated end. The raw casting may also include a barrel portion having an internal bore. The rear portion may serve as a precursor for a rear end cap and associated clevis of the hydraulically actuated ram assembly and the front portion may serve as a precursor for the rod clevis of the hydraulically actuated ram assembly which may be screw threadedly attached to a piston rod or piston of the hydraulically actuated ram assembly.
