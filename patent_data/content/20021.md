# Method for the direct electrodeposition of a chromium layer on a metal substrate and a lithographic sheet comprising a metal substrate covered with such an electrodeposited chromium layer.

## Abstract
Electrodeposition of a layer of chromium of selectively constituted crystalline character and grain texture on metal substrates, such as aluminum or steel base lithographic sheet provides improved and directly chromium plated aluminum or steel base lithographic sheet capable of oper atively functioning as a surface plate after exposure of an applied photo sensitive coating thereon. Such chromium layer is disposed in adherent interfacial engagement with the surface of a metal substrate and is compositively con stituted of coalescively agglomerated assemblages of subagglomerated spheroidate particles of generally lobular curvilinear contour characterized by an effective absence of generally planar exterior surfaces and relatively sharp protuberant angles.
