# Variable reluctance actuators having improved constant force control and position sensing features.

## Abstract
A variable reluctance actuator, of either the linear or rotary type, having a moving element 14 operated by a solenoid 10 , is controlled by a signal from a Hall effect sensor 26 which signal is representative of flux density in the magnetic circuit of the actuator. The actuator may be operated in either a constant force control mode, or a position sensing or control mode. Substantially constant force, independent of position of the actuator s movable element 14 , is obtained by varying, rather than stabilizing, the sensed magnetic field during move ment. Position sensing, independent of actuator force, is ob tained by variably controlling the magnitude of the excitation current of the Hall effect sensor 26 in response to the magnitude of the current and Hall sensor output.
