# Long span bridges.

## Abstract
A suspension bridge has a first deck 10 supported from a pair of suspension cables 14 and 15 by hangers 12 and 13 and a second deck 11 independently supported from a pair of suspension cables 18 and 19 by hangers 20 and 21. The two parallel decks are separated by a gap whose width is not less than that of either of the decks and is preferably three or more times the width of a deck. The decks are joined at intervals diagonal shear braces so that the two decks behave essentially as a single rigid body in regard to rotation in the plane of Figure 2. This results in very high aerodynamic damping of both torsional and bending modes of oscillation.
