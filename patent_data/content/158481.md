## Description
HAIR CARE COMPOSITIONS Technical Field The present invention relates to antimicrobial compositions and to their use in hair care. In particular it relates to hair care compositions having improved antidandruff efficacy. Background Dandruff is a widespread problem, some 502 608 of the overall population suffering with dandruff at varying periods of their lives and to varying degrees. Although the cause or causes of dandruff are still not precisely settled, the microorganism Pityrosporum Ovale is strongly implicated in the etiology of to scurf formation process. The use of pyridinethione salts as antidandruff agents in shampoos and hair rinse is well knawn. US A 3,236,733 discloses detergent compositions containing such salts.Other references include US A 2,809,971 and US A 3,723,325. it is also known that certain l hydroxy 2 pyridone derivatives are effective as antimicrobial agents with specific application to dandruff control. G2 A,1,440,975 is relevant in this respect. Both the pyridinethione salts and the l hydroxy 2 pyridones have been clinically proven to reduce the level of dandruff when used regularly over, for example, a four week period. Typically, there is a reduction in mean dandruff grades of about 65 70 after four weeks twice weekly usage.Continued treatment can provide some further marginal improvements but on average, these materials reach a plateau in anti dandruff effectiveness. Improvements in the level of dandruff reduction or in the rate at which dandruff reduction is achieved, would therefore be highly desirable. The present invention is based on the finding that a combination of certain pyridinethiones and hydroxypyridones provide improved antidandruff efficacy when used in hair compositions such as shampoos, cream rinses and the like. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, the present invention provides an antimicrobial composition comprising a mixture of a a water insoluble salt of 1 hydroxy 2 pyridinethione I , and b a hydroxypyridone having the general formula II, or a salt thereof EMI2.1 wherein R is an aliphatic or aranatic moiety hL ing a tr factor of at least 1.3. The compositions of the invention comprise two essential conents, a pyridinethione component I and a hydroxypyridone component II . The pyridinethione component of the present invention can generally be defined as water insoluble salts of l hydroxy 2 pyridinethione which has the following structural formula in tautomeric form, the sulfur being attached to theNo. 2 position in the pyridine ring.EMI2.2 The salts result fran substitution of the hydrogen of one of the tautomeric forms by the appropriate salt cation.Depending, of course, on the valence of the salt cation involved there may be more than one of the pyridinethione rings in the compound. Preferred salts are formed from heavy metals such as zinc, tin, cadmium, magnesium, aluminium and zirconium. The preferred heavy metal is zinc. Other cations such as sodium are also suitable, however. The pyridinethiones generally take the form of water insoluble particles. These can have an individual particle size of at least 1 micraneter. Preferred materials, however, are pyridinethione crystals in the form of predominantLy flat platelets which have a mean sphericity of less than about 0.65, preferably from about 0.20 to about 0.54 and a median particle size of at least about 2 micrometres, the particle size being expressed as the median equivalent diameter of a sphere of equal volume. The upper limit on mean particle size is not critical but generally can range up to about 25 micrometers, measured on the same basis. The median diameters are on a mass basis with 50 of the mass of particles falling on either side of the value given. The diameter of a sphere of equivalent volume for a particle can be determined by a variety of sedimentation techniques which are based on Stokes Law for the settling velocity of a particle in a fluid. Such techniques are described in Stocham, J.D. and Fochtman, E.G., Particle SizeAnalysis, Ann Arbor Science, 1978. An approach for determining the median equivalent spherical diameter based on volume, dv, is shown in EP A 34, 385, Example II. The sphericity of a particle is also described by StocKham and Fochtman at page 113 as dv ds 2, where dv is the diameter of a sphere of equivalent volume, supra, and d5 is the diameter of a sphere of equivalent area. As used herein, however, the mean sphericity is dV dS 2, or the surface area of spheres having equivalent volume distribution divided by the actual surface area of particles as measured. A technique for determining actual surface area is shown in the examples using the technique described by Stockham anFochtman at page 122. From the viewpoint of anti dandruff efficacy, the surface area herein preferably falls in the range fran about 0.5 to about 3.5, more preferably from about 1.0 to about 3.0 m2 g. In preferred embodiments, pyridonethione anti dandruff agents herein are at least partly in agglomerated form, the agglomerate size preferably being such that at least about 20 by weight, more preferably at least about 50 by weight of the pyridonethione is in the form of agglomerates having an equivalent spherical diameter of at least about 5 microns, preferably from about 7 to about 30 microns, mote preferably from about 10 to about 20 microns. Agglomerate size is conveniently measured by sedimentation techniques using a sedigraph 5000, Micrometrics Corp., the agglomerates being predispersed in water under low shear conditions.Agglomeration is preferred from the viewpoint of optimizing overall formulation anti dandruff efficacy. The hydroxypyridone component II of the present composition can generally be described as l hydroxy 4 methyl lH pyridones having an aliphatic or aromatic moiety R at the 6 position thereof, wherein R has a 1r factor of at least 1.3, preferably from 2 to 6, more preferably from 3 to 5.5. The fr factor is a measure of the lipophilicity hydrophilicity of the substituent and is defined in detail in the paper by W. Dittmar, E. Druckrey andH. Urbach, J. Med. Chem. 17 7 , 753 6 1974 and references cited therein. In structural terms, preferred R substituents are selected from linear and branched C3 Cll, preferably C6 Cll alkyl and alkenyl groups, C58 cycloalkyl groups, and aryl groups. In the above, cyclic moieties can also be substituted with one or more alkyl or alkenyl groups up to C4. The R groups can further be substituted with halogen atoms. Of the above, preferred R moieties are cyclohexyl and 2,4,4 trimethyl pentyl, the latter being highly preferred. The above mentioned compounds can be used both in the free form and as salts, for example, salts with organic bases or inorganic cat ions. Low molecular weight alkanolamines are especially preferred organic bases, for example triethanolamine. The pyridinethione hydroxypyridone mixtures specified herein are useful in a variety of hair care compositions as antidandruff aids. The total level of pyridinethione and hydroxypyridone is generally from about 0.1 to about 5 , preferably from about 0.5 to about 3 by weight of composition. The weight ratio of pyridinethione salt to hydroxypyridone is generally from about 10 1 to about 1 10, preferably from about 5 1 to about 1 5. Individually, the pyridinethione salts and hydroxypyridones are each generally present at a level of from about 0.05 to about 3 , preferably from about 0.2 to about 2 by weight of composition. Included among the hair care compositions are shampoos, creme rinses, hair tonics, hair conditioners, hair sprays, lotions and creams and many others. Shampoos are the preferred compositions and components generally found in such compositions are given below. One essential component of the antidandruff shampoos herein is a surfactant. The term surfactant as used herein is intended to denote soap and nonsoap surfactants. The surfactant component usually comprises from about 5 to about 50 by weight of the composition, preferably from about 108 to about 20 .

Many cationic surfactants are known to the art. By way of example, the following may be mentioned dodecyltr imethylammoni um chloride nonylbenzylethyldimethylammonium nitrate tetradecylpyridinium bromide laurylpyridinium chloride cetylpyridinium chloride laurylpyridinium chloride laurylisoquinolium bromide di tallow hydrogenated dimethyl ammonium chloride dilauryldimethylammonium chloride and stearalkonium chloride.Many additional nonsoap surfactants are described inMcCUTCHEON S, DETERGENTS AND EMULSIFIERS, 1979 ANNUAL, published by Allured Publishing Corporation. The above mentioned surfactants can be used alone or in combination in the shampoo ccsitions of the present invention. The compositions of the invention will generally contain a suspending agent. The suspending agent is preferably substantially crystalline in form. Also, preferred suspending agents are nonrpolymeric and non clay in nature, such materials being found to have a deleterious effect on overall anti dandruff efficacy. Accordingly, the compositions herein are preferably substantially free of nonionic and anionic polymeric and clayotype suspending agents. By substantially free it is meant not more than about 20 ppn of these materials. Preferred suspending agents include ethylene glycol and glycerol esters of fatty acids having from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms. Both ethylene glycol mono and distearate are examples of these esters. Other useful suspending agents are alkanolamides of fatty acids having from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms, preferably about 16 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable examples of these agents include stearic mcncethanolamide, stearic diethanolamide, stearic monoisopranolamide, stearic diethanolamide distearate and mixtures thereof. Still other suitable suspending agents are C16 C22 alkyl dimethylamine oxides such as stearyl dimethyl amine oxide and C16 C22 fatty acid amidoalkylamines such as stearamidoethyldi ethylamine. Mixtures of suspending agents are also acceptable, for example, a mixture of glyceryl stearate and stearamidoethyldiethylamine. When present, these suspending agents are at levels of fran about 1 to about 7 , preferably from about 2 to about 6 . These agents may also serve to give pearlescence to the product. The antidandruff sha pocs herein can contain a variety of non essential optional ingredients suitable for rendering such compositions more stable and desirable. Such conventional optional ingredients are well know to those skilled in the art, e.g., pearlescent materials such as bismuth oxychloride, guanine and titanium dioxide coated mica, preservatives such as beneyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and imidazolidinyl urea thickeners and viscosity modifiers such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate and sequestering agents such as disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate. An amide is a preferred optional component present in the shampoo aspect of the present invention. Any of the alkanolamides of fatty acids useful in shampoo ccmp0sitions can be used. Generally, these include mono and diethanolamides of fatty acids having from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms. Preferred compounds include coconut monsethanolamide, lauric or coconut diethenolamide, and mixtures thereof. The arnide is present at a level of from about 2.0 to about 4.0 . It is believed that a more richer lathering, more stable product results when amides of these types are combined with the other components of the invention at hand. Minor ingredients such as perfumes, dyes and coloring agents can also be added to the instant compositions to improve their consumer acceptability. If present, such agents generallyNcomprise from about 0.1 to 2.0 by weight of the coEposition. The shampoos herein are preferably in the form of liquids or creams in which water is the principal diluent. The level of water in the compositions is typically from about 35 to about 90 by weight. Creme rinses, hair tonics and other hair care compositions as well as shampoos can contain the pyridinethione hydroxypyzidone mixtures of the present invention. These compositions can contain a variety of other components including sane of those described above for shampoos. Creme rinses generally contain a cationic surfactant similar to those described above, particularly stearalkonium chloride and ditallow dimethyl anffnorlium chloride at a level of from about 0.1 to about 5 , preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 .Cream rinses can also contain a fatty alcohol such as cetyl alcohol, stearyl aloshol and mixtures thereof at a level of from about 0.5 to about 5 , preferably from about 1.0 to about 3.0 ty weight of composition. The hair care compositions herein have a pH generally in the range from about 3 to about 8. Preferred compositions are acidic however, highly preferred compositions having a pH in the range from about 3.5 to about 6.5, especially from about 4 to about 6. The pH is measured on a 1 solution basis. A preferred EH regulating agent is a ctric acid sodium citrate buffer. Other acidulating agents such as phosphoric acid, succinic acid etc. can also be used, however. Propylene glycol which is frequently added to shampoo compositions as a conditioning aid, has been found to have a generally deleterious effect on overall anti dandruff efficacy for the compositions of the invention. Accordingly, the compositions are preferably substantially free of propylene glycol. By substantially free of is meant less than about 0.1 by weight of this material. A process for preparing the compositions herein comprises preparing a surfactant premix comprising from about 50 to about 538 by weight of final composition of water and from about 2 to about 30 by weight of final composition of surfactant at a temperature in the range from about 710C to 880C, cooling the premix to a temperature in the range fran about 21 C to about 490C, preferably from about 210C to about 46 C, and thereafter adding the pyridinethione and hydroxypyridone antidandruff agents to the cooled premix.Suspending agent, when present, is added to the surfactant premix at the high temperature stage and the premix is maintained after cooling for a sufficient period to achieve substantial crystallization of the suspending agent prior to adding the pyridinethione and hydroxypyridone antidandruff agents. Alternatively, the hydroxypyridone can be added to the surfactant premix at the high temperature stage. The step of adding the pyridinethione is preferably performed under low shear nan turkulent flow conditions.
