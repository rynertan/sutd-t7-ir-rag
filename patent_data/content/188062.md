# Alignment aid for gun muzzle reference system.

## Abstract
An alignment aid for use in installing a reference system of known type which reflects an image of an indicator mark 5 mounted on a gun turret 2 , back into the gun sight 8 via a mirror 6 mounted at the muzzle end 7 of the gun barrel 1 , for comparison with a reference mark 20 on the graticule 10 of the gunsight, thereby to indicate any angular deviation between the muzzle axis and the gunner s line of sight. The alignment aid, which is used in setting the mirror 6 to provide initial coincidence between the indicator mark image 21 and the reference mark 20 , consists of a highly reflective viewing screen 30 attachable to the turret adja cent the indicator mark, and a projection lamp 31 attached to the gun sight so as to protect an image of the reference mark onto the screen, via the telescopic optics of the gunsight and the mirror 6 .
