# VIDEO RECORD DISC AND PLAYBACK APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR IT

## Abstract
A video recording disc for use with programmable play back apparatus, wherein information recorded on the disc includes a video signal and a digital programme instruction sequence for use by the apparatus in sequencing its operating mode in a prescribed fashion. The recorded video signal includes a carrier that is normally modulated by an audio signal, but that, for a limited number of selected tracks on the disc, is modulated by the digital programme instruction sequ ence, whereby the playback apparatus can operate initially to scan the selected tracks to recover the recorded programme instruction sequence after which the operating mode of the apparatus is controllably sequenced in accordance with the recovered instructions.
