# A LINEAR MEASUREMENT APPARATUS

## Abstract
A linear measurement apparatus is in the form of a highly portable and manipulable hand held pen which can be linked by an interface to a computer running a spreadsheet program. The pen comprises a sensing tip in the form of a ball 4 , at one end of a rotary shaft 5 , running along the axis of the pen. The shaft 5 may be driven in rotation, its rotation being detected by a sensor 11, 12, 13 which can provide a count indicative of the amount of rotation of the ball 4 and thus of the length of a line the ball 4 traverses. The line length can be entered in the spreadsheet.
