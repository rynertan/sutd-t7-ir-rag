# VACUUM DEPOSITION APPARATUS

## Abstract
The invention provides vaccum deposition apparatus including a chamber 3 , a vapor source 2 , a deposition substrate 1 opposite to the vapor source 2 and an inlet 6 for a modifying gas, wherein in use the vapor source 2 is heated in the presence of a modifying gas to be deposited onto the substrate, characterized by an electron beam sup plying device 10,40 for emitting an electron beam toward the substrate 1 . The supply of electrons ionizes the gas only near the film surface being deposited thus allowing more even introduction.
