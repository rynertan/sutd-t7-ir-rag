## Description
MOUNTANT SOLUTION DESCRIPTIONThis invention relates to the retarding of immunoflurescence during microscopy. During the past two decades, the phenomenon of fading of fluorescein during excitation has been studied extensively in the course of the development of immunoflurescence methodology. The exposure of fluorescein stained samples to short wave ultra violet excitation, as provided, for example, by high pressure mercury vapour burners in common use, results in very rapid fading of fluorescein staining in tissue samples.The blue light emitted by quartz halogen bulbs produces less rapid fading, but although these lower powered sources are entirely satisfactory with appropriate microscope accessories for viewing gross staining as seen for example with tissue sections in screening tests for auto antibodies, more recent applications of immunofluorescence involving the staining of specific determinants on cell surfaces and the precise location of intracellular components and inclusions requires maximum excitation by more powerful light sources. In consequence, the fading of fluorescein stained has become a major problem and efforts have been redoubled to find means of retarding or eliminating this fading. It has recently been found that the addition of p phenylenediamine PPD to the buffered glycerol used for mounting the stained preparation has a profound effect in retarding fading during subsequent microscopy. p Phenylenediamine, however, is a material that is open to objection in routine use since it is a skin sensitising agent, it is photo sensitive and it undergoes oxidative degradation. According to the present invention, there is provided a mountant composition for use in retarding the fading of preparations stained for immunofluorescence with a fluorochrome which composition comprises one or more of sodium azide, sodium iodide and 1, 4 diazobicylo 12,2,23 octane in a suitable solvent carrier therefor.The solvent carrier may be glycerol phosphate buffered solution The glycerol phosphate buffered solution may comprise 8 to 10 parts glycerol to one part of phosphate buffered solution and preferably has a pH within the range o8 o 9. A further embodiment of the present invention provides a composition comprising a solvent of glycerol phosphate buffered solution in the ratio of 9 1 volume volume at a pH of 8.4 to 8.8 and a proportion of one or more of sodium azide, sodium iodide and 1,4 diazobicylo 2,2,2 octane in a concentration of at least lO 2M. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the standard solution for the mountant composition in accordance with the present invention may comprise 9 parts of glycerol, typically an Analar grade, BDH and one part phosphate buffered solution PBS . The pH is preferably adjusted to match the fluorochrome.In the case of fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC the pH is adjusted to 8.6 by the addition of O.lm NAOH.When the retardant component is sodium azide or sodium iodide it may be dissolved in the PBS before addition to the glycerol. When the retardant component is l,4 diazobicylo 2,2,2 octane DABCO it may be dissolved in the glycerol with gentle heat in a water bath before the addition of PBS.

Anti nuclear StainingThe IF technique employed was based on cyostat sections 6 um of rat liver which were treated with a poo7 √èf ANA positive sera, diluted 1 10, known to give a mixed diffuse and speckled nuclear staining pattern after washing in PBS 0.15M NaCl in 0.01M phosphate pH 7.4 the sections were stained for 30 minutes with anti human Ig FITC conjugate Wellcome Reagents diluted 1 160 and after further washing mounted in glycerol mixtures prepared as described below. Use of multi spout slides enabled replicate series of measurements to be made on previously un exposed test areas.2. Preparation of Mounting FluidsThe standard solution contained 9 parts of glycerol Analar grade, BDH and 1 part PBS. The p was adjusted to 8.6 optimum for FITC fluorescence emission Nairn 1976 by the addition of 0.lM Na0H. Test substances were usually dissolved in the PBS before it was added to the glycerol with the exception of DABCO v.infra which was solubilised directly in the glycerol with gentle heat in a water bath before addition of PBS the addition of aminopiperidine which is basic necessitated adjustment of pH with 0.lM HCl. The following compounds were tested sodium azide Aldrich , soldium iodide Hopkin and Williams polyvinyl alcohol Cytochemical Co. polyvinyl pyrrolidone Sigma , 4 amino 2,2 ,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine Ciba Geigy , indole Koch Light , gramine Aldrich NN dimethylaniline Aldrich , diphenylamine Aldrich , and 1,4 diazobicyclo 2,2,2 octane DABCO Ralph NEmmanuel .3. MicroscopyA Zeiss Photomicroscope II equipped for incident illumination was employed with high pressure mercury burners HBO 100 stablised and HBO 50 unstablised the excitation wavelength transmittted by the primary filter was 450 490 nm and the barrier filter was a long pass LP 520. Measurements were also made using transmitted darkfield illumination with a 100W quartziodine lamp run at 12 volts, Balzer FITC 3 primary filter and Kodak Wratten 12 secondary filter. TheFITC 3 filter was supplemented with Pilkington LP1 red absorbing . All light sources were previously un used.4. Fluorometry a EquipmentThis was basedron the eiss SF microscope photometer and comprised a photomultiplier showing high response at the wavelength of FITC emission R928 Fig 1 attached to the microscope tube head. The latter incorporated a measuring diaphragm. The photomultiplier was connected to a power supply incorporating a 4 digit voltmeter. The opening of the measuring diaphragm corresponded to an area of 10 2 mm2, determined with a haemocytometer and a x16Planachromat objective, which included approximately 20 hepatocytes. Results obtained were therefore not subject to possible variation due to differences in staining intensity of individual nuclei and represent the total light emitted by representative areas of the sections.An apochromatic x40 objective having a high numerical aperture 0.95 was employed in later experiments for comparative purposes as described below.b ProcedureThe gain control of the voltmeter was adjusted to give a reading of about 808 of maximum with the dark current at zero and the stained section in focus.These settings were not altered during a session of comparative measurements. A previously un exposed section was then placed in position with the microscope lamp shutter closed, focussing was checked on opening the shutter, the stage moved to an adjacent field and the voltmeter reading taken simultaneously a timer was started. Readings were taken every 15 seconds for the first minute and at one minute intervals for a total of five minutes. Blank readings were taken in the same way of an unstained section mounted in the same medium as the stained slide.These blank readings were found to be crucial to the study, accounting for as much as 25 of the values obtained on stained sections. The sections employed for blank measurements were washed in parallel with the stained sections as it was found that cryostat sections mounted directly showed approximately twice the luminosity of washed sections. A further source of irrelevant blank values was eliminated by removing the sub stage condenser assembly from the incident microscope as this component was found to enhance readings by back reflection.5. Calculation of ResultsBlank readings showed a very slight decay amounting to a few less than 5 units on the voltmeter scale, mainly in the first 15 seconds exposure these were substracted from the corresponding readings obtained on stained sections which were then expressed as a percentage of the initial reading and plotted against time on linear ordinates. At least two sets of readings were taken using virgin fields for each and means values calculated. Each set of comparisons shown was obtained in a single run.6. Solution Phase StudiesFluorescence spectra were recorded using aPerkin Elmer MPF 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer, at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm. iIrradiation of the solution was performed in a stoppered fluorimeter cell 10 mm x 45 mm containing a small, glass covered, metal bar. The cell was mounted on a magnetic stirrer and light from a 75W high pressure Xenon lamp, at a distance of 25 cm, focussed on to the cell. A semi circular metallic reflector was positioned behind the cell, and the solution was continually stirred throughout the irradiation.A stock solution of the anti human Ig FITC conjugate used in the ANA system was prepared in phosphate buffered saline 0.15M NaCl in 0.01M phosphate pH 7.4 at a concentration of 3mg in 10 ml. 0.5 ml aliquots of this solution were diluted to 5 ml using the appropriate solvent distilled water, deuterium oxide Goss , phosphate buffered saline as above , or glycerol BDH, AR Grade . After thorough mixing, 3 ml of the solution were transferred to a fluorimeter cell and the mixture flushed with either oxygen or argon for 5 minutes and then stoppered.The fluorescence spectrum of the solution was recorded prior to, and on cessation of the illumination period usually 2 1 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes . The fluorescence intensity at 520 nm after each irradiation was calculated as a percentage of the initial fluorescence intensity prior to irradiation.By this method the photo fading of the fluorescence of the FITC conjugate in solution was conveniently monitored. Similar experiments were performed in the presence of DABCO, NaN3 and NaI 0.lM respectively .Readings were adjusted for thermal degradation by subtracting the measurements obtained on control solutions kept in the dark during the irradiation period.The efficiency with which the additives DABCO, NaN3 and NaI quenched the fluorescence of the FITC conjugate in phosphate buffered saline solution was assessed by determining the Stern Volmer quenching constants Cox and Kemp 1971 . This was achieved by diluting 2.5 ml of the stock solution of the FITC conjugate to 25 ml with phosphate buffered saline, then taking 5 ml aliquots of this solution and adding different amounts of the quencer between 0 and 0.25M . 3 ml of the prepared solution was transferred to a fluorimeter cell and the fluorescence spectrum recorded, measuring the intensity of fluorescence at 520 nm. In this way, plots of Io I versus concentration of quencher gave the Stern Volmer quenching constant according to the equation Io 1 Ksv Q where Io Intensity of fluorescence in the absence of quencher. I Intensity of fluorescence in the presence of quencher at a concentration Q .Each Stern Volmer plot was subject to least squares analysis by computer. A microsecond flash photolysis apparatus AppliedPhotophysics Ltd was used to detect the triplet state of fluorescein Lindqvist 1960 . The effect of additives such as DABCO, NaN3 and NaI upon the triplet states was monitored at 550nm.RESULTS 1. Fading in Standard Buffered GlycerolA comparison of the rates of fading obtained with the three light sources at low magnification x16 is shown in Figure 2. The more potent HBO 100 burner induced a slightly more rapid fading by incident illumination than the HBO 50 and the Q1 lamp employed in the transmitted light system was intermediate. 2. Retardation by PPD 2 Addition of the amine at a concentration of 10 2M resulted in a much slower decay with overlapping of the curves during the first two minutes Figure 3 .3. Effects of Sodium Azide, Sodium Iodide and DABCOPreliminary tests indicated that these additives did produce retardation, but that a higher concentration than 10 2M was required for this to be at a useful level. The results obtained with a final concentration of 2.sag per cent are shown in Figure 4 for the widely employed HBO 50 incident system. It is evident that at this concentration all the materials have a significant effect.3. Other AdditivesInitially, promising results were obtained with aminopiperidine. However, this substance appeared to be unstable since subsequent findings were inconsistent and further investigation of it was therefore discontinued. Other additives which retarded fading at high concentration were polyvinyl alcohol and less effectively polyvinylpyrrolidone.Their performance is shown in Figure 5. Indole, gramine, NN dimethylalanine and diphenylamine all showed no retardation when screened at a concentration of l02M. 5. Effect of Increased MagnificationSince in practice higher magnification than x16 is usually employed measurements were repeated using the dry x40 apochromat n a 0.95 in the incident light system. When used with the HBO 100 lamp this high performance objective significantly accelerated fading of a section mounted in standard buffered glycerol Figure 6 . When PPD l02M and DABCO 2.5g per cent were re tested at the higher magnification with the more conventional HBO 50 lamp they both showed a reduced but still marked anti fading effect Figure 6 . In further experiments using a x63 planachromat oil immersion objective na. 1.4 with the HBO 100 lamp we recorded a fluorescence half life of 6 seconds in preparations mounted in plain buffered glycerol.6. Solution Phase StudiesSolutions of the FITC conjugate were found to be unstable at room temperature and it was therefore necessary to correct all the measurements made on irradiated solutions to allow for thermal degradation.Irradiation of the FITC conjugate in phosphate buffered saline solution in the presence or absence of oxygen led to bleaching of the fluorescence.Bleaching was slightly faster when oxygen was present Figure 7a . The rate of bleaching was measured for solutions of FITC conjugate in oxygenated distilled water and oxygenated deuterium oxide, and little difference found between the two systems, i.e. there was no solvent isotope effect upon the bleaching process Figure 7b .When the bleaching was studied using glycerol solutions containing buffered FITC conjugate, the bleaching was less rapid and the presence of oxygen had no noticeable effect. DABCO, NaN3 and NaI all e retarded the bleaching process in both the aqueous buffered solution Figures 8a, 8b and in the buffered glycerol solution Figures 9a, 9b .Stern Volmer quenching constants for the quenching of the FITC conjugate in phosphate buffered solution byDABCO, NaN3 and NaI were 3.95 0.24, 2.54 0.34 and 3.77 0.22 respectively.Flash photolysis studies showed that the triplet state of fluorescein is not quenched by DABCO, NaN3 or NaI.Following are examples of mountant compositions in accordance with the present invention.
