# Method for preparing a magnesium halide support for catalysts.

## Abstract
A process for preparing an effective support for the titani um halide component of a coordinate complex catalyst for the polymerization of alphaolefins comprises the steps of a intimately contacting a magnesium or manganese chloride or bromide with a drying agent at an elevated temperature. b milling the magnesium or manganese chloride or bromide so as to activate its surface and c repeat contacting step a and milling step b for two or more cycles, whereby the effective support is produced.
