## Description
PESTICIDAL FORMULATIONS This ins n relates to pesticidal fo lations. in our copending U.K. Patent Application 9539 76 U.S. Serial 812440 we describe an apparatus or the electrostatic spraying of pesticides on to pl s. Electrostatically charged sprays have particl ad vantages. They are attracted to the foliage o plants this helps to ensure that as much as possible o. the spray reaches its Intended target, and as littl as possible is misdirected on to the ground or carved awav by the wind. Moreover, electrostatic forces promote eve coating, and carry spray droplets to the underside of leaves as well as to exposed surface. In spite of these advantages, the electrostatic spraying of crops with liquid formulations has not come into widespread use, for lack of convenient, reliable and cheap apparatus. None, however, the apparatus of aforesaid U.X. PatentApplication 29539 76 is available for the purpose. This patent application discloses the spraying of solutions of various pesticides in organic solvents. The object of the present invention is to provide concentrated formulations of oil insoluble pesticides suitable for spraying by the apparatus described in U.K.Patent Application No. 29539 76 U.S. Serial 812440 , or modifications thereof. According to the present invention we provide a readv for use electrostatically sprayable pesticidal formulation comprising a dispersion of from 1 to 50 of an oil insoluble pesticide in a liquid organic diluent medium, the pesticide having G mean particle size n tne range of about 1 to 30 microns and the formulation having a resistivity at 200C in the range 1 x 106 to 1 x 1010 ohm centimetres and a viscosity at 200C cf 1 to 50 centistokes. By the term pesticide we mean an insecticide, acaricide, herbicide, defoliant, plant fungicide, plant bactericide or plant anti viral agent and we also include within the term similar chemiv which are applied to plants, such as plant growth regulators. By the term 11oil insoluble , we mean soluble in the organic diluent medium used in the formulation to an extent of less than 2 by weight at 200C.Examples of suitable oil insoluble pesticides for use in the invention are copper salts, zineb, maneb, mancozeb, captafol, captan, diclobentrazol and like substituted triazoles fungicides carbaryl, menazon insecticides 2,4 D acid,MCP acid, simazine, atrazine, paraquat salts or complexes, glyphosate, 2 amino 4 methylphosphinobutyrylalanylalanine herbicides gibberellic acid, l 4 chlorophenyl 4,4 dimethyl 2 l,2,4 triazol l yl pentan 3 ol plant growth regulators . The foregoing are generally substantially nsoluble in most organic diluent media suitable for use in the invention. Dispersions according to the invention may contain more than one pesticide a second pesticide need not necessarily be oil insoluble. The pesticide to be used in the invention may be reduce to the required particle size by dry milling or wet milling. If wet milling is used, it may be milled in the presence of part or all of the organic diluent used in the final formulation. Dry milling may be followed by dispersion of the active ingredient in the organic diluent in a high speed mixer. We find that dispersions according to the invention are readily sprayed at satisfactory rates using the apparat Js of U.K. Patent Application Ne 29539 76 .S. Serial 812440 and will give a range of mean spray droplet sizes of from about 50 to about 200 microns in diameter, according to the strength of the electrostatic field applied to them the stronger the field the smaller the droplets , flow rate through the apparatus and other operating conditions. The resistivity of dispersions according to the invention is cn 7eniently measured by measuring the resistance of a cell of standard dimensions containing the dispersion held at z temperature of 200C, using, for example, a Keithley electrometer. It is preferred that the resistivity of the dispersions be in the range 107 to 109 ohm centimetres. The viscosity of dispersions according to the invention is conveniently measured by timing the flow of a measured quantity of the dispersion through a hole of known size as is done, for example, in the Redwood viscometer . It is preferred that the viscosity of the dispersions is in the range 2 to 25 centistokes. The resistivity and viscosity of the dispersions depend primarily on the properties of the diluents used to make them, though they are also affected by the nature and amount of the dispersed pesticide. One way of obtaining the desired properties is to mix diluents having various resistivities and viscosities.High boiling hydrocarbon diluents, e.g. paraffins, kerosene, are convenient and relatively cheap, but usually have low viscosities e.g. of the order of 3 centistokes and high resistivities e.g. of the order of 101l ohm centimetres . To bring down the resistivity of these materials, they may be mixed with polar diluents such as alcohols and in particular ketonic diluents.These have lower resistivities but are also usually not viscous enough for example, the useful diluent cyclohexanone has a resistivity of about 2 x 106 ohm crntimetres, but a viscosity of cnly about 3 centistokes.However the viscosity cf the dispersion may be increased by addition of more viscous oil soluble diluents, for example polybutenes e.g. Hyvis Trademark and long chain chlorinated hydrocarbon products such as Cereclor Trademark C42 or C48. The latter has a high resistivity, greater than 1010 ohm centimetres, and a high viscosity, of the order of 100 centistokes. By suitable adjustment of the proportions of three diluents such as these, a dispersion of the desired properties can easily be obtained. The resistivity of diluents and dispersions is easily affected by the presence of water or other contaminants. It is not necessary always to use ultra pure materials, but consistent results will only be obtained from materials of consistent composition and formulations which have been made up with the desired properties should thereafter be protected from any further contamination, especially by water. An alternative way of producing a dispersion with the required properties is to make up a diluent mixture or dispersion of the required viscosity but excessive resistivity e.g. from a mixture of hydrocarbons and long chain chlorinated hydrocarbons and then dose this with an antistatic agent to reduce the resistivity to the desired level. A suitable antistatic agent is sold for use as a static charge dissipator with hydrocarbon fuels under the name ASA it consists of a complex mixture of copper and chromium cations with various organic acid anions. Other similar materials, e.g. copper oleates, may also be used. This technique is not generally suitable by itself for producing dispersions having a resistivity below about 108. The pesticidal effects of the compositions of the invention are in certain circumstances better than those of conventional formulations. For example, diclobentrazol formulations according to the invention give better control of wheat rust than conventional highvolume sprays. The following Examples illustrate the invention.
