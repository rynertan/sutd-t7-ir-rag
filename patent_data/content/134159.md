# AN IMPROVED EDGE PROTECTOR WEATHERSTRIP

## Abstract
An edge protector weatherstrip is disclosed having im proved flange retention characteristics and including an elasto mer material 30 such as a polymeric compound secured to a surface or surfaces of the weatherstrip which are adjacent to or engageable with an edge flange 16 when the weatherstrip is assembled thereon. The compound is soft, solid and tacky within a range of temperatures between at least 34 C and 260 C and greatly increases the retention force between the edge flange 16 and weatherstrip 12 and further provides a water barrier to prevent water seepage around the flange 16 .
