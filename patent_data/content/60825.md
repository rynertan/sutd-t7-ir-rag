# Polyvinyl chloride polyblends having improved resistance to elevated temperatures.

## Abstract
Rubber modified copolymers of styrene and maleic anhyd ride can be blended with polyvinyl chloride and optional impact modifiers to produce polyblend compositions with advantageous properties. The polyblend compositions comprise A. from 20 to 80 by weight of polyvinylchloride B. from 80 to 20 by weight of a rubber modified copoly mer of a vinylaromatic monomer, and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride and copolymerizable termonomer, wherein the relative weight proportions of the monomers are 50 to 85 of the vinylaromatic monomer, 15 to 30 of the anhydride and 0 to 20 of the termonomer and wherein the monomers are poly merized in the presence of 6 to 25 by weight of a rubber having a glass transition temperature below 0 C and C. from 0 to 40 by weight of a composition comprising a graft copolymer of from 20 to 40 by weight of a monomer selected from the group comprising methyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile and 80 to 60 by weight of a vinyl aromatic monomer said copolymer being grafted on to from 10 to 60 , based on the weight of the composition of a substrate rubber having a glass transition temperature below 0 C.
