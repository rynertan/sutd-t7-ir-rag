# Modification of a hydrocarbon fuel by dissolving in it a specified copolymer of tert butylstyrene in conjunction with a hydroxylic liquid and an amino compound.

## Abstract
Specified copolymers of tert butylstyrene are dissolved in a liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon fuel, especially an aircraft fuel, by the steps of i blending the finely divided copolymer with a non solvent hydroxylic liquid miscible with the fuel, ii mixing the blend into the fuel so as to give a copolymer concentration of 0.1 1 by weight, and iii dissolving in the fuel so treated an amino compound in an amount of 0.01 0.6 mole per 100g of copolymer present. The copolymers thus dissolved impart to the fuel a resistance towards mist formation when the fuel is subjected to conditions of shock.
