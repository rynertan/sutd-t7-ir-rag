# SELF CLEANING JOINT

## Abstract
A self cleaning joint is disclosed. The joint 15 is disposed in an air flow passage 30 , such as that of a vacuum cleaner power nozzle 10 , and allows an element attached thereto, such as a vacuum cleaner hose to which it is connected, to be pivoted between first and second positions. The joint 15 includes a chamber 20 and a tubular member 22 having a first portion 23 pivotably disposed in the chamber and a second portion 24 protrud ing from the chamber 20 . To prevent abrasion of the joint 15 caused by the accumulation of abrasive particles, the inner walls of the chamber are provided with grooves 34, 35, 36 where any dust which penetrates the joint 15 can collect. The grooves 34, 35, 36 are positioned so that they are cleaned periodically by the flow of air in the passage 30 .
