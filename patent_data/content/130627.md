# Alkaline storage battery.

## Abstract
An alkaline storage battery is described including a po sitive electrode comprising as an active material a cobalt hydroxide base containing from about 15 to about 65 wt nickel hydroxide and a negative electrode comprising zinc or cadmium as an active material the alkaline storage bat tery can be charged rapidly, has a high energy density, and the residual capacity of the battery can be easily measured by detection of the electromotive force of the battery. Resulting charge and discharge characteristics are shown in Figure 1.
