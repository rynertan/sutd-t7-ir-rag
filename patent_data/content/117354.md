Such a machine is described inUnited Kingdom Patent Application No.2,069,142 A.It is an object of this invention to extend the above teaching to more complex machine tools. Summary of the InventionA machine tool according to this invention is characterised in that said tool is one of a plurality of tools each movable between an inoperative position and an operative position relative to the work holder, and further characterised by a support provided adjacent said operative position and relative to which the respective tools are movable when moving between the inoperative and operative positions, and a contactless coupling means arranged between the operative tool and the support for the contactless transmission of said signal. Brief Description of DrawingsPreferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a sectional side elevation of a part of a lathe being a first embodiment of the invention.Fig. 2 is a plan view of Fig.1.Fig. 3 is a system diagram of an electrical system used in the embodiment of Figs.1,2.Fig. 4 is a sectional side elevation of a part of a machining centre being a second embodiment of the invention.Fig. 5 is a section on the line V V in Fig.4.Fig. 6 is a system diagram of an electric system used in the embodiment of Figs.4,5.Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic plan view of a lathe including details similar to those shown in Figs.1 to 3.Description of Preferred EmbodimentsReferring to Figs.1 to 3, a cutting tool 10 has a generally elongate body 11 at one end of which is provided a cutting element 12 secured to a support member 13. The tool 10 is releasably secured to a tool holder or carousel 101. Two piezo electric sensing elements 14 are gripped in position between the member 13 and the body 11 by a screw 15. The elements 14 are in the form of dowels which locate the member 13 on the body 11. A pad 141 is arranged between the member 13 and the body 11 to provide, together with the elements 14, a three point support for the member 13 on the body 11. The elements 14 are each adapted to change state and produce an electrical analogue signal 14A if a force acting on them is varied. The elements 14 are connected to respective amplifiers 16 powered by a battery 17.The amplifier outputs, 16A, are connected by an OR gate 161 in turn connected to a light emitting diode 19 adapted to output a transmission signal or light beam 19A corresponding to the signal 14A.The amplifiers 16, battery 17 and OR gate 161 are housed in a recess 18 in the body 11. The diode 19 is provided on the body 11 in position to transmit the beam 19A to an optical receiver or photo diode 20 provided on a tool holder support or bearing housing 21. The tool 10 is one of an annular array of such tools provided on the carousel 101 and the latter is indexable relative to the bearing housing 21 to bring the tools selectively from an inoperative into an operative position relative to a work piece 25 supported by a work holder or chuck 251. The tool for the time being in the operative position is referred to as the operative tool . Figs.1,2 only show the operative tool.The diodes 19 of the respective tools constitute, together with the diode 20, a contactless coupling system for the transmission of said change of state of the elements 14 from the operative tool 10 to the bearing housing 21. The electrical output of the receiver 20 is connected to a trigger circuit 23 which converts the analogue signal 19A into a pulse signal 23A when a given force on the cutting element 12 is exceeded. The housing 21 and chuck 25 are movable relative to one another in coordinate directions in the usual manner to bring the tool into engagement with the workpiece for effecting a cut or to withdraw the tool from the workpiece when the cut is completed. The signal 23A is produced when the tool 10 attains a predetermined position relative to the work piece, in this case, a position when a light pressure is exerted by the tool on the work piece.The signal 23A is connected to a counter 24 driven by an opto electronic scale not shown and well known per se for determining the relative position of the tool 10 and the work piece 25 during the coordinate movement thereof.The signal 23A is arranged to transmit the instantaneous content of the counter 24 to a register 26 whose content is therefore a measure of the relative position of the tool and the work piece.The machine described is used for measuring the dimensions of the work piece where engaged by the tool. A typical such measuring operation is preferably carried out by bringing the tool slowly into engagement with the work piece while the latter is not rotating.Then, given that the position of the cutting extremity, denoted 121, of the tool is known relative to a datum as by a prior datuming operation , the content of the register at the instant of the signal 14A is a measure of the relevant dimensions of the work piece. The tool must, of course, be halted as nearly as possible instantaneously after such engagement with the work piece. Such halting can readily be effected by the usual control system for effecting said relative movement. However, the measuring operation may also be performed on initiation of a cut, i.e. when the tool is first engaged with the work piece while the latter is rotating, or the operation may be performed on completion of a cut when the tool is disengaged from the rotating work piece and the force on the tool falls to zero. In the latter case an appropriate zero sensing circuit not shown is provided. The signal 14A may also be used for measuring the operating load on the tool, e.g. with a view to preventing overload. In any case, it will be seen that since the sensing elements 14 are situated on the tool in close proximity with the cutting element 12, and since also the amplifier 16 is embodied in the tool, there is a strong yet sensitive response. At the same time, the provision of contactless transmission by means of the optoelectronic coupling 19,20 to the single receiver 20 provides a simple means for transmitting the signal from an array of tools, such as the tool 10, to stationary structure.Referring to Figs.4 to 6, a rotary cutting tool 30 has a cylindrical body 31, provided at one end with a cutter 32 having an annular array of cutting elements 321. At its other end the body 31 has a grooved collar 33 for cooperation with an automatic tool change mechanism, indicated 331, whereby the tool can be inserted into or removed from a tool holder or drive spindle 34 supported for rotation in a tool holder support or head 35, the connection between the tool and the spindle being by means of a taper shank 36 provided at the other end of the body 31. A work piece 37 is supported on a work holder or table 371. The head 35 and the table 371 are movable one relative to the other by coordinate slides 372,373 to effect tool feed, and the spindle is rotatable relative to the head 35 for imparting cutting motion to the tool. The body 31 has provided thereon a sensing element or strain gauge 38 positioned to sense the bending strain on the body 31 due to to engagement between the elements 321 and the work piece. A passive circuit 39 connects the strain gauge 38 to a coil 40 embodied in the free end of a first arm 42 extending radially from the cylindrical body 31. The coil 40 is proximate to a coil 41 mounted on the head 35. The coils 40,41 define a first inductive coupling.The strain gauge 39 comprises four strain responsive resistances 381 arranged symmetrically around the body 31 and connected in a bridge circuit 382 Fig.6 having an output 382A to a coil 384 embodied in the free end of a second arm 421 extending radially from the body 31. The coil 384 is proximate to a coil 385 mounted on the head 35 and constitutes a second inductive coupling therewith.The circuit 39 is engaged by an oscillator 43 mounted on the head 35 and acting through the first coupling 40,41. The output of the bridge circuit 382 is transmitted via the second coupling 384,385 to a trigger circuit 44 adapted to produce a signal 44A responsive to the bridge output 382A exceeding a given magnitude. The signal 44A is used to transfer the instantaneous content of a counter to a register essentially the same as described with reference to the signal 23A of Fig.3. The coils 40, 384 of the respective tools and the coils 41,385 of the head 35 constitute a contactless coupling system for transmission, between the tool 30 and the head 35, of the energising signal 46 as well as of the change of state signal of the gauge 38 signified by the output 382A.In operation, when it is desired to use the tool 30 for measuring the workpiece, the head 35 and the work piece 37 are moved one relative to the other to bring one of the cutting elements 32 into engagement with the work piece. Normally the spindle 34 would not be rotated for the measuring operation. Different elements 321 may be used for engagement with differently orientated surfaces of the work piece. Thus, for example, as indicated in Fig.5, when it is desired to measure the diameter of a bore 47, diametrally opposite elements 32 may be used for engagement with diametrally opposite surfaces of the bore. A change in bending strain due to said engagement is sensed by the bridge circuit 382. It will be clear that the couplings 40,41 and 384,385 are each a means for contactless signal transmission between the tool and the head.The invention is not limited to the piezo electric elements 14 or strain gauge 38 described. Any forcesensitive or strain sensitive means may be provided on the tool to respond to engagement between the tool and the work piece. Further, instead of relying on engagement with the work piece, the invention may provide for the sensing at a distance, e.g. by the break down of a potential between the tool and the work piece when the tool is a short distance therefrom or by the use of an ultrasonic signal between the tool and the work piece.Referring to Fig.7, the lathe, denoted 400, has a tool holder or carousel 401, a work holder or chuck 402, and slides 404,405 along which the carousel 401 is linearly movable for machining a workpiece 406, held in the chuck 402, by means of a tool 407A connected to the carousel 401. The tool 407A is one of a plurality of tools 407 connected to the carousel around the periphery thereof. The linear movement of the carousel 401, more specifically the movement of the tool 407A, is measured by optoelectronic scales 408 only one shown having an output 409 to a computer 410. The measurement is made relative to a datum being a sensor 411 having a fixed position relative to the chuck 402. Before machining, each tool 407 is engaged with the sensor 411 to establish the datum position of the tool in a manner known per se.The carousel 401 is supported for rotational indexing on the slide 404 so that each tool 407 can be moved between an inoperative position IP and an operative position OP relative to the chuck 402, the operative position being that of the tool 407A which is accordingly referred to as the operative tool . Adjacent the operative tool 407A there is provided a support 412 being, in this embodiment, a part of the slide 404. An opto electronic coupling 413 is provided for transmission of a signal 414 between any one operative tool 407A and the support 412 substantially as described with reference to Figs.1 to 3. The signal 414 occurs responsive to engagement of the tool with the workpiece 406 and is transmitted by appropriate cable 415 to the computer 410 there to be related to the output 409 to determine the position of the surface of the workpiece 406 with which the tool 407A was engaged, the surface being selected by program control in a manner known per se. The coupling 413 is protected by a sealed cover 416.
