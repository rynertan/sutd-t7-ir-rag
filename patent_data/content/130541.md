# Flywheel apparatus.

## Abstract
A flywheel apparatus of the invention has a base 12 and a rotor 20 . The rotor 20 is supported by a magnetic bearing 44 . The magnetic bearing 44 has a first annular plate mem ber 46 of a magnetic material, a second annular plate mem ber 56 of magnetic material radially opposing the first annular plate member 46 so as to define a first annular gap 58 , and at least two magnetic circuits M1, M2 formed between the first and second annular plate members 46 and 56 as the first annular 58 is a common magnetic path. The apparatus further includes solenoids 82, 84, 86, 88 for changing, at a plurality of positions along the circumferential direction of the first annular magnetic gap, the density of the magnetic fluxes passing along the common magnetic path.
