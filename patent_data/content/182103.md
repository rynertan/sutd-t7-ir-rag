# Heat radiation control device.

## Abstract
A heat radiation control device in accordance with the present invention has a construction that includes a heat transmitting part 36 which receives heat transfer from a heat source side 12 , a freely expansible and contractible bellows case 20 installed between the heat transmitting part 36 and a frame 26 , having a working fluid sealed in its interior, a heat receiving part 32 on the radiator side 16 arranged to face the heat transmitting part, to which the heat transmitting part is able to make contact by the elonga tion of the bellows case, and a biasing means 42 for biasing the heat transmitting part 36 at a position sepa rated by a fixed distance with respect to the heat receiving part 32 . According to the construction like in the above, since the bellows case expands and contracts under the tem perature variations in the heat transmitting part that re ceives heat transfer from the heat source side, and the heat transmitting part contracts recedes with respect to the heat receiving part on the radiator side, it is possible to control automatically the heat transfer from the heat source side to the radiator side in response to the temperature variations on the heat source side.
