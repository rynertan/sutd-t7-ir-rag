# Transmission integrity arrangement and method.

## Abstract
In a stored program controlled electronic telephone switching system transmission links 108 are provided from a host office 102 , provided with a central processor 100 , to one or more remote offices 111 , each provided with a remote processor 112 . Data and control information are continually passed between the host office 102 and each remote office 111 in a digital time division format. Data integrity is monitored through a cyclic odd and even patterned parity scheme which predetermines the parity of sequential time slots in one direction of transmission and reflects that parity pattern in the return direction of transmis sion between host office and remote offices. The patterned parity scheme detects hardware faults in the interface for the transmission links between host and remote offices on a continuous basis.
