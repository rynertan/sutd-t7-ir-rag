# Process for accurately determining plate positions in steam generators.

## Abstract
A process for using an eddy current probe 25 having two connected coils 37, 39 to locate the edges 16a, 16b of a support plate 13 whicn surrounds a tube 9 of a heat exchanger, comprises the steps of moving the eddy current probe 25 through the interior of the tube 9 in the vicinity of the plate 13 . The rate of change of coil impedance is monitored as a function of the position of the coils 37, 39 along the longitudinal axis of the tube 9 . When the rate of change of current flow through a coil attains its first maximum, the mid plane of the coil is parallel to the bottom edge of the support plate. This process is particularly useful where heat exchanger tubes are selectively expanded to eliminate or reduce unwanted clearances between the tubes and the bores in the support plate through which they extend.
