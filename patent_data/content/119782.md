## Description
TITLE VARIABLE ANGLE PIPE JOINT THIS IE wNTION relates to a variable angle point. An object of the invention is to provide a means whereby two pipes may be connected together with their respective axes inclined to one another at any one of a range of angles. According to the invention there is provided an intermediate pipe joint member for a variable angle pipe joint, which member comprises a hollow element having a spigot like formation at a first end which defines a polar axis, and a socket like formation at its other, second end which also defines a polar axis that is at an angle to the axis of its first end, the spigot like formation being receivable within the socket like formation of a further, similar pipe joint member with the spigotlike formation being relatively rotatable within the socket like formation of the further member, to deter mine the relative orientation of the respective axes thereof. The spigot like formation may define an external cylindrical surface and the socket like formation may define an internal cylindrical surface such that when the spigot like formation is received in the socket like formation, the internal cylindrical surface of the socket like formation engages the external cylindrical surface of the spigot like formation. Further, the spigot like formation may define an external cylindrical surface and an internal cylindrical surface and the socket like formation may define a pair of opposed internal cylindrical surfaces such that when the spigot like formation is received in the socket like formation, the internal cylindrical surfaces of the socket like formation engage the external and internal cylindrical surfaces respectively of the spigot like formation. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the pipe joint member, the spigot like formation may be constituted by a rim portion at the first end there of and the internal cylindrical surfaces of the socket like formation at the second end thereof may define an annular recess complementary to the rim portion. It will be appreciated that the first end of the pipe pint member may define a plurality of spigotlike formations and the second end thereof may define a corresponding number of socket like formations. For example, the first end of the member may comprise the rim portion and at least one other spigot like formation si milar to the rim portion but of smaller diameter and concentric therewith, and then the second end of the member may define a corresponding number of concentric annular recesses. The spigot like formation may taper towards its periphery. Then the internal cylindrical surfaces of the socket like formation may be correspondingly inclined to one another. The spigot like formation may be a push fit into the socket like formation. The pipe joint member may be curved. Further, the axis of the socket like formation and the axis of the spigot like formation may be at an angle of 1350 to one another.
