# DENTAL ALLOY AND PROSTHESIS

## Abstract
A non discoloring palladium based alloy, free of silver or gold, suitable for fusion to dental porcelain compositions consists essentially of 75 85 by weight of Pd, 5 10 by weight of In, 5 10.5 by weight of Sn, up to 7.5 by weight of Co, Cr or Ni and up to 0.25 by weight of Si. Inclusion of 0.2 0.7 by weight of Ru improves the physical and mechanical properties of the alloy.
