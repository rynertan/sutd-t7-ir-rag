## Description
The present invention concerns an electronic device for measuring direct or variable currents, of the type corn prising one or more meters with differentiated outputs, capable of measuring a direct or variable current, repre senting on its turn another physical quantity measured upstream, in particular, even if not exclusively, in scientifical instruments used in the fields of chromatography, gas chromatography, photometry, mass spectrorretry, pNN measure or the like.For the technological applications of the above mentioned type or similar applications, it is necessary to measure currents with wide dynamic range, which can reach values 10 15 5 of about 10 for instance from 10 A to 10 A . To obtain reliable outputs on the whole considered range, meters of different types have been proposed and it has also been considered to place several meters,in series and differently calibrated which provide as many as si multaneous outputs Italian Patent Aplication N. 4792 so 82 of same Applicant . However, these solutions not always have proved to be useful and economical, above all when one wants to obtain a very high subdivision of the range, namely a relatively high number of outputs with increasing capacities according to subsequent ration of relatively reduced value.In this case, according to the known technique, it should be necessary to have a meter for each output, which would make the device unduly compli cated.To overcome said inconvenience, the invention proposes a measuring device of the type above defined wherein the output of at least one of the meters iS subdivided into two or more lines in parallel, at least some of which are provided with amplifiers or attenuators of the signal to provide a series of simultaneous outputs having different capacities.The invention will be now described more in detail with reference to examples of configuration of same, illustrated in the schemes of the attached figures 1 and 2.Referring to figure 1, a direct or variable current to be measured is applied to the terminal 1 of the device, the terminal 2 of which is placed at the common pole.In the case illustrated, in series between the terminals 1 and 2 two meters 3a and 3b are foreseen and they can be of any known type, for instance, but not necessarily, as illustrated in the above mentioned patent application.The outlets 4a and 4b of the two meters 3a and 3b can 3 have a ratio for example of 10 , which means that the 3 sensitivity of the meter 3b is 10 times higher and its 3 capacity 10 times lower than that of the meter 3a. In case one wants to have several outputs, having increasing capacities with lower ratios, for example according to powers of 10, each of the outlets 4a and 4b of the meters 3a and 3b is subdivided into more lines, for example three lines Sa, 6a, 7a and Sb, 6b, 7b rispectively, at least some of which are provided with amplifiers or attenuators of the signal.In the shown case, the output lines Sa and Sb have no amplifier or attenuator of the signal, lines 6a and 6b are provided, for example, with an amplifier 8a and 8b having a gain of 10 each and the lines 7a and 7b are provided with an amplifier 9a and 9b having a gain of 102 each. In this way, six outputs are obtained, from 11 to 15, the sensitivities of which are increasing in succession according to powers of 10, while, obviously, the capacities are decreasing accordingly.The presence of these six simultaneous lines of measure at low impedan ce, progressively saturating with the increase of input current, allows both the commutation of an output meter without causing transient states, and the application of the six lines themselves at the input of a data processor or of an electronic computer, which will automatically identify the most suitable line for the reading or the storage of the signal.Figure 2 illustrates another possible configuration of the concerned device.The reference 3 indicates a current measuring device of the floating type, the terminals 1 and 2 of which are isolated from the common pole. The output line 7 is preceded by an attenuator 4, having again of 0.1 the line 8 is a direct outlet from meter 3 the line 9 is preceded by an amplifier 5, having a gain of 10 finally, the line 10 is preceded by an amplifier 6, having a gain of 100. So it is possible to obtain a series of four lines with progressively increasing gains, in particular of 0.1, 1, 10, 100. What hereinabove described clearly shows that the illustrated configuration can undergo different changes and variations, concerning the number and type of used meters, the number of output lines in parallel, the type of signs amplifiers or attenuators, and finally the gains or the ratios of attenuation established.All these changes and variations must be considered as falling within the scope of the present invention.
