## Description
PRE A ATION OF CAPBOXYPHENYLTHlOPHENYLACETIC ACIDS The present invention relates to the preparation of dibenzo b,f thiepins and their derivatives. More particularly, it is concerned with the preparation of certain carboxyphenylthiophenylacetic acids, which are used as intermediate compounds in the synthesis of such dibenzothiepins, which are prostaglandin antagonists. Examples of prostaglandin antagonists that may be prepared from the intermediate compounds made using the methods of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification US A 4,237,160, IJ.S. Patent Application No.396,452 and European Patent Specification EP A 0011067. In one embodiment of the present invention, dibenzolb,f thiepin and its derivatives are prepared by a process that includes direct carboxylation of an ortho toluyl aryl sulfide to introduce a phenylacetic acid side chain.This transformation generally functions as the crucial step in the synthesis of dibenzo b,f thiepin compounds. Prior syntheses of compounds containing the dibenzo Fb,f thiepin skeleton see, for example, U.S. Patent Specification US A 4,237,160 andM. Rajsner et al., Collection of Czechoslov. Chem. Commun., 42, 3079 3093 1977 suffer from the non availability and or expensive nature of functionalized ortho halo phenylacetic acid derivatives required as starting materials. The preparation of these starting materials is inefficient and multi step. The present invention obviates their use and allows the use of readily available ortho halo toluic acid derivatives in a single high yielding carboxylation step, which replaces the low yielding multi step procedure of the prior art. In the process of the present invention, and unlike in previous methods, the phenylacetic acid side chain is prepared after the diaryl sulfide linkage has been established. This introduces a greater flexibility in the synthesis of the dibenzo b,f thiepin skeleton and permits of the use of less costly and commercially available starting materials. This direct carboxylation approach establishes the phenylacetic acid side chain in a single high yielding step. In one of its embodiments, a process for preparing a compound of the formula I EMI2.1 in which each of R1 and R2, independently of the other, is a hydrogen or halogen i.e. fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or a C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, C1 4 alkylthio, C1 4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 4 alkyl sulfonyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethylthio, cyano, nitro, di C1 4 alkyl amino, carboxy, or phenyl4C1 4 alkyl radical, the phenylalkyl radical optionally having halogen, nitro or C1 4 alkyl substitution in the phenyl ring, comprises treating a dianion of the formula IL EMI2.2 in which R1 and R2 are as defined above, with carbon dioxide in an inert solvent at a temperature of 40 to 0 C, particularly 20 C. The pressure is preferably atmospheric but a higher pressure could be used. The inert solvent is preferably an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane glyme , bis 2 methoxyethyl ether diglyme or ethyl ether, particularly a 20 1 mixture by volume of tetrahydrofuran and 1,3 dimethylimidazolidinone. Each of R1 and R2, independently of the other, is preferably a hydrogen or halogen atom. The aforementioned dianion may be formed from a compound of the formula III EMI3.1 in which R1 and R2 are as defined above, by initially forming a carboxylate salt with a base, for example, sodium hydride, followed by deprotonation.Deprotonation may be accomplished with an alkali metal dialkylamide base for example, lithium diethylamide , an alkylamide base for example, ethyl amide or isopropyl amide , or an alkali metal amide base, for example, lithium or sodium amide . The preferred base is lithium diisopropylamide.The preferred temperature is 40 to 10 C, particularly about 20 C. The pressure is preferably atmospheric, but a higher pressure could be used. The solvent should be inert and is preferably an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane glyme , bis 2 methoxyethyl ether diglyme or ethyl ether, particularly a 20 1 by volume mixture of tetrahydrofuran and 1,3dimethylimidazolidinone. Preferably, the dianion prepared from the compound of Formula III is not isolated and the dianion of Formula II is immediately converted to the desired compound of Formula I. In view of the fact that the carboxylation reaction may be difficult when R1 and R2 are bromine, iodine, alkylthio, alkyl sulfinyl, alkyl sulfonyl or nitro, compounds of Formula II and the compounds of the Formula III from which they are prepared having such substituents are not preferred as starting materials. The process of the present invention is also applicable to compounds in which each of R1 and R2, independently of the other, is amino, C14 alkanoyl, hydroxyl, thio, C1 4 alkylamino, C1 4 hydroxyalkyl, mercapto, and phenyl C1 4 alkyl in which the phenyl ring has an amino or hydroxy substituent. For such compounds, however, these functional groups should be protected prior to the carboxylation reaction. The following reaction scheme showing the synthesis of 2 3 fluorophenylthio 4 carboxyphenylacetic acid, which is an intermediate compound in the production of S 7 fluorodibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxylic acid 5 oxide, illustrates the importance of the process of the present invention EMI4.1 The initial step in the above synthesis involves diazotization and bromination of 3 amino 4 methylbenzoic acid, which proceeds in 95 yield. Reaction of this aryl bromide 1 with m fluorothiophenol produces sulfide 2 in 898 yield. This reaction involves the in situ formation of 3 fluorophenylthiocopper ArSCu with cuprous oxide which subsequently couples with the aryl bromide at 180 1900c. Incorporation of the diaryl sulfide linkage at this early stage in the process results in improved yields and elimination of side reactions compared to the prior process. Use of the readily available aryl bromide t obviates the use of iodide or bromide 3, an economically unattractive intermediate compound in the prior synthesis. EMI5.1 The crucial carboxylation of 2 is accomplished in a single step via its dianion. The dianion is generated by initial formation of the carboxylate salt with sodium hydride with final benzylic deprotonation being accomplished with lithium diisopropylamide at 200C. Treatment with carbon dioxide produces diacid 4 in 92 yield. This direct carboxylation approach establishes the phenylacetic acid side chain in a single highyielding step, thus eliminating the previous three step sequence of benzylic photobromination, cyanide displacement and hydrolysis overall yield 30 40 . Ring closure may be effected by methods disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,237,160. The following reaction scheme shows a similar synthesis of 4 carboxy 2 phenylthiophenylacetic acid 6 which is an intermediate in the preparation of 3 hydroxymethyldibenzo b,f thiepin 5,5dioxide EMI6.1 Reaction of 3 bromo 4 methylbenzoic acid 1 with thiophenol and cuprous oxide in quinoline at 180QC produces 3 phenylthio 4 methylbenzoic acid 5 in 95 96 yield. Generation of the dianion of 5 is accomplished by sequential treatment with sodium hydride and then lithium diisopropylamide in a solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran and 1,3 dimethylimidazolidinone at 200C. Carboxylation at 15 with carbon dioxide at a pressure of one atmosphere produces the diacid 6 in 90 yield. The following Examples are illustrative of the present invention EXAMPLE 1Preparation of 2 3 Fluorophenylthio 4 carboxyphenylacetic acidStep A 3 Bromo 4 methylbenzoic acid A 22 liter 3 necked, round bottom flask, fitted with an overhead stirrer, thermometer, and a 2 liter addition funnel was charged with water 6.4 liters and 3 amino 4 methylbenzoic acid 2.1 kg, 13.89 mole to produce a thick slurry. While cooling the mixture in an ice water bath, concentrated hydrochloric acid 1.76 liters was added over a 5 minute period. The internal temperature rose to 350C during this addition.The mixture was recooled to 30C with an aqueous ethanol dry ice bath and a solution of sodium nitrite 1006 g, 14.58 mole dissolved in water 1.4 liters was added over a 1hour period, maintaining the temperature between 3 and OOC. During the final stages of the addition, gas evolution and consequent foaming were observed.Care should be exercised to maintain the cooling bath temperature at no lower than 100C. Below that temperature significant precipitation of the diazonium salt occurs thereby hampering its transferral from the reaction vessel. Meanwhile, a 30 U.S. gallon 114 liter polypropylene vat, equipped with an overhead stirrer, and a 3 liter jacketed brine cooled addition funnel was charged with 48 hydrobromic acid 19 liters and cuprous bromide 3.52 kg, 24.53 mole and heated to 30 350C in a water bath. The cold diazonium salt solution was transferred in portions to the brine cooled addition funnel to maintain the temperature of the diazonium hydrochloride solution at OOC and added to the vigorously stirred cuprous bromide solution over about 1.5 hours, maintaining a reaction temperature of 35 400C and adding diethyl ether periodically in 100 to 300 ml portions with a total volume of about 800 ml being added, in order to reduce the volume of foam caused by nitrogen evolution.Nitrogen evolution subsided and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The product was recovered from the reaction mixture by suction filtration. The filter cake was sucked completely dry because addition of water to the unfiltered reaction mixture precipitates highly water insoluble copper salts which it is difficult to remove. The filter cake was washed with sufficient water until neutral as tested with alk acid paper and the product was air dried at 7a 750C overnight to provide a tan solid 2811 g, 94.1t , mp 203 2050C Recrystallization of a sample from aqueous ethanol provided cream colored needles, mp 206 207.50C. Analysis of the product prior to recrystallization by HPLC reverse phase, Altex, ultrasphereoctyl, 5 Wm, 25 cm x 4.6 mm I.D., CH3CN H20, 50 50 v v with 0.1 H3PO4, flow rate 2.0 ml minute indicated an impurity retention time 2.0 minutes of 8 10 based on W absorbance at 254 nm . The retention time of the product is 4.2 4.3 minutes. This impurity is believed to be 3 hydroxy 4methyl benzoic acid based upon expected ompetitive side processes. STEP B 3 3 Fluorophenylthio 4 methylbenzoic acid A 22 liter 3 necked round bottom flask, fitted with an overhead stirrer, thermometer and distillation head was placed in a heating mantle and charged with quinoline 6 liters , 3 bromo 4 methylbenzoic acid 2.725 kg, 12.67 mole , m fluorothiophenol 1.70 kg, 13.28 mole and cuprous oxide 958 g, 6.69 mole . Due to its pervasive stench, the m fluorothiophenol was transferred in a fume hood.The reaction of 3 bromo 4 methylbenzoic acid and m fluorothiophenol with quinoline was exothermic causing a temperature rise to 750C. The red slurry was placed under a nitrogen blanket and heated with stirring to 180 1900C over a l hour period collecting the water as it distilled. When the internal temperature reached 1100C, the mixture became very thick and distillation of water commenced. This thickening was caused by the formation and precipitation of m fluorothiophenyl copper. Continued heating slowly redissolved this precipitate with the mixture becoming completely homogeneous at a temperature of 1500C, This temperature range was maintained for 0.5 hour. The progress of the coupling may be conveniently monitored by reverse phase HPLC Altex, ultrasphere octyl, 5 corm, 25 cm x 4.6 mm I.D., 50 50, volume volume, CH3CN H2O with 0.1 H3P04, 2 ml minute . Retention time 3 bromo 4 methylbenzoicacid 4.2 4.3 minute, 3 3 fluorophenylthio 4 methylbenzoic acid 9.7 10.0 minute. The black mixture was allowed to cool to 1100C and then transferred to a stirred solution of 6N hydrochloric acid 28 liters . After stirring overnight, the crude product was collected by suction filtration and washed with 6N hydrochloric acid 19 liters , and then with water until the filtrate was neutral alk acid paper . The filter cake was washed with five l liter portions of isopropanol and air dried overnight at 400C to provide the title compound as a dark tan solid 2785 g, 83,88 mp 154 158 C. Recrystallization of a sample from toluene yielded white needles, mp 162 l630C. Analysis for C14F11FO2S, calculated C 64.ll H 4.20 S 12.22 F 7.24. found C 64.25 H 4.23 S 12.29 F 7.38. Quantitative HPLC assay of this material prior to recrystallization using column conditions as described above in this paragraphs, indicated a product purity of 95 . The isopropanol filtrate was concentrated to dryness, dissolved in acetone 2 liter and treated with charcoal 182 g for 30 minutes. Filtration through Celite and concentration under vacuum provided a dark solid which was crystallized from hot toluene 2 liter to yield a second crop of product as tan needles 305 g, 9.2 mp l40 1440C. Both crops were suitable for use directly in the subsequent transformation. If desired, an alternative procedure may be used to obtain material of higher melting point.This involves azeotropically drying the water washed filter cake with toluene and subsequent crystallization from a minimum volume of hot toluene approximately 200 g liter . When this modification was performed on a reaction involving 1660 g 7.72 mole of 3 bromo 4 methylbenzoic acid a first crop of 1631 g 80.8 , mp 161.5 1630C and a second crop of 124 g 6.18 , mp 158 1610C were obtained for a combined yield of 86.9 .STEP C 2 3 Fluorophenylthio 4 carboxyphenylacetic acid In this step, all glassware was dried via a vacuum purge technique under nitrogen, with all manipulations carried out under an inert atmosphere and the solvents tetrahydrofuran, 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone and diisopropylamine were all dried over 4 Angstrom 400 pm sieves prior to use. A dry, 3 necked, 12 liter round bottom flask, equipped with an overhead stirrer, condenser, calibrated addition funnel, thermometer and nitrogen inlet was charged with sodium hydride 202 g, 50 oil dispersion, 4.12 mole , tetrahydrofuran 300 ml and 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone DMI 525 ml . A slight out gassing and color change occurs upon addition of DMI to the sodium hydride. 3 3 Fluorophenylthio 4 methylbenzoic acid 1050 g, 4.01 mole was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran 2300 ml under nitrogen endothermic and slowly added over 2 hours to the sodium hydride slurry with vigorous stirring. Addition at this rate maintained the internal temperature between 55 600C. Hydrogen evolution subsided and the mixture was allowed to cool slowly.The color of the reaction mixture t this stage may vary from golden yellow to black depending on the quality of the starting sulfide. Meanwhile, a dry 3 necked 22 liter roundbottom flask, equipped with an addition funnel, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and overhead stirrer was charged with tetrahydrofuran 8.0 1 and diisopropylamine 725 ml, 5.17 mole . The source and quality of the THF used here is crucial. Fisher reagent grade tetrahydrofuran provided a clear yellow solution of lithium diisopropylamide. An inferior tetrahydrofuran might produce black colored mixtures of lithium diisopropylamide, unsuitable for use in this reaction. The integrity of the THF diisopropylamine solution may be tested by treating a sample with n butyllithium prior to proceeding with the entire batch. The stirred solution was cooled to 300C in an acetone dry ice bath and n butyllithium 3125 ml, 5.06 mole, 1.62 M in hexane was added over 15 minutes. n Butyllithium is commercially available in 5 U.S. gallon 19 liter steel cylinders from Lithium Corporation ofAmerica and may be conveniently dispensed directly into the calibrated addition funnel immediately prior to its introduction to the reaction vessel. The temperature rose to 100C and a clear yellow solution resulted. The solution was re cooled to 400C and the earlier prepared sulfide solution was added over 15 minutes, producing an opaque mixture. The cooling bath was removed, and the temperature allowed to rise to 200C. On a large scale, the otherwise slow warm up may be hastened by immersing the reaction vessel in cold water.Ca bon dioxide bone dry gas was rapidly bubbled through the reaction mixture with vigorous stirring for 1.5 hours. The opaque mixture decolorized producing a cream colored precipitate. Isopropanol 200 ml was carefully added to consume any excess of sodium hydride or lithium diisopropylamide present, then 1 liter of water was carefully added over about 15 minutes. The reaction mixture darkened and layer separation occured. The mixture was transferred to a large extractor, diluted with an additional 3.5 1 of water and stirred for 15 minutes. The lower aqueous layer was removed and the organic phase washed with 5 aqueous sodium hydroxide 1.6 liters . The total aqueous extracts were combined and acidified with vigorous stirring with concentrated hydrochloric acid approximately 1.5 liters . The product separated as a solid. If oiling occurred, stirring was continued and 4 to 5 liters of hexane was added to induce solidification.After 2 hours of vigorous agitation the mixture was filtered, washed with water and air dried at 400C to give a cream colored powder, 1130 g, 92 , mp 200 2030C. Recrystallization of a sample from aqueous isopropanol produced white needles, mp 207 207.50C.Analysis for C15H11FSO4 calculated C 58.81 H 3.62 S 10,47 F 6.20. found C 58.84 H 3.57 S 10.52 F 6.38. Quantitative HPLC analysis reverse phase,Altex, ultrasphere octyl, 5 microns, 25 cm x 4.6 mmI.D., CH3CN H2O, 40 60 v v with 0.1 H3PO4, 2 ml minute, 254 nm indicated a purity of 87 89 . EXAMPLE 2 4 carboxy 2 phenylthiophenylacetic acidStep A 4 Methyl 3 phenylthiobenzoic acid A 22 liter 3 necked round bottom flask, fitted with an overhead stirrer, thermometer and distillation head was placed in a heating mantle and charged with quinoline 6 liters ,3 bromo 4methylbenzoic acid 2.75 kg, 12.79 mole , thiophenol 1.75 kg 15.22 mole and cuprous oxide 958 g, 6.7 mole . The red slurry was placed under a nitrogen blanket and heated with stirring to 180 2000C over a 1 hour period collecting the water as it distils.This temperature was maintained for 0.5 hours. The mixture was cooled to 1100C and then transferred to a stirred solution of dN hydrochloric acid. After overnight stirring, the product was collected by suction filtration, washed with 6N hydrochloric acid 19 liters and then with water until neutral alk acid paper . The filter cake was washed with isopropanol and dried at 400C in vacuo to yield the title compound as a tan solid 2.97 kg, 95 yield, 918 purity . Step B 4 Carboxy 2 phenylthiophenylacetic acid A dry 3 necked, 12 liter round bottom flask, equipped with an overhead stirrer, condenser, calibrated addition funnel, thermometer and nitrogen inlet was charged with sodium hydride 202 g, 50 oil dispersion, 4.12 mole , tetrahydrofuran 300 ml and 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone DMI 525 ml .3 Phenylthio 4 methylbenzoic acid 980 g, 4.01 mole rsdissolved in tetrahydrofuran 2300 ml under nitrogen endothermic and slowly added over 2 hours to the sodium hydride slurry with vigorous stirring.Addition at this rate maintained the internal temperature between 55 and 600C. Hydrogen evolution subsided and the mixture was allowed to cool slowly. Meanwhile, a dry 3 necked 22 liter roundbottom flask, equipped with an addition funnel, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and overhead stirrer was charged with tetrahydrofuran 8.0 1 and diisopropylamine 725 ml, 5.17 mole . The stirred solution was cooled to 300C and n butyllithium 3125 ml, 5.06 mole, 1.62 M in hexane was added over 15 minutes.The temperature increased to 100C and a clear yellow solution resulted. The solution was re cooled to 400C and the earlier prepared sulfide solution was added over 15 minutes, producing an opaque mixture.The cooling bath was removed and the temperature allowed to rise to 200C and aged for 10 minutes.Carbon dioxide bone dry gas was passed over the surface of the reaction mixture with vigorous stirring for 1.5 hours. The opaque mixture decolorized producing a cream colored precipitate. Isopropanol 200 ml was carefully added to consume any excess of sodium hydride or lithium diisopropylamide present, then 1 liter of water was carefully added over about 15 minutes. The reaction mixture darkened and layer separation occured. The mixture was transferred to a large extractor, diluted with an additional 3.5 1 of water and stirred for 15 minutes. The lower aqueous layer was removed and the organic phase washed with 5 aqueous sodium hydroxide 1.6 liters . The total aqueous extracts were combined and acidified with vigorous stirring with concentrated hydrochloric acid approximately 1.5 liters . The product separated as a solid. If oiling occurs, stirring should be continued and 4 to 5 liters of hexane added to induce solidification. After 2 hours of vigorous agitation, the mixture was filtered, washed with water and air dried at 400C to give a tan to cream colored powder, 1060 g, 92 yield, 92 purity .
