# Method and apparatus for removing flaps from a continuous web of paper.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for removing flaps 4 from a perforated web of paper P by drawing the perforated web over an abrasively surfaced drum 12 rotating in the same direction as the paper is travelling and at a peripheral speed about seven times greater than the speed of the web. The web is passed over the drum such that the flaps are at the leading or downstream edges of the perforations and lie between the paper and the drum. A spring biased pressure yoke 14 holds the perforated web against the drum surface with a predetermined amount of pressure to facilitate abrading the flaps from the web.
