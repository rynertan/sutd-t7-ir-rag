The present invention concerns a dosing device for simply hygienically dispensing the so called premixed be verages. The dosing device of the present invention comprises a housing provided with a discharge opening, a plunger within said housing for stopping the outflow of the beverage from the discharge opening when in rest position. The plunger being at least partially composed of magnetizable material, and a movably positioned magnet, the magnet being magnetically coupled to the plunger in such a way that by an appropriate mechanical displacement of the magnet, the plunger is displaced thereby enabling the outflow of the beverage from the discharge opening by gravity.
