# Stirling engine and stirling engine heater.

## Abstract
In a stirling engine 40 which has an expansion cylinder 42 and a compression cylinder 44 with an expansion piston 46 and a compression piston 48 , respectively, that have a fixed phase difference between them, where the expansion cylinder 42 and the compression cylinder 44 are connected through a heater 58 , a regenerator 52 , and a cooler 50 , a fixed amount of working fluid is sealed in the expansion cylinder 42 and the compression cylinder 44 , and the engine is driven by heating or cooling the working fluid with the heater 58 or the cooler 50 , and the heater 58 for heating the working fluid includes a combustion chamber 62 attached to the expansion cylinder 42 , a burner 98 for jetting a combustible substance into the combustion chamber 62 , a plurality of heat exchanger pipes 66 for forming a plurality of passages for the working fluid to connect through between the expansion cylinder 42 and the regenerator 52 by turning back on themselves, in order to heat the working fluid with the high temperature gas from the burner 98 , and a cylinder head 64 for installing the plurality of heat exchanger pipes 66 , in a concentric configuration with approximately equal distance apart and with an inclination of predetermined angle, on the expansion cylinder 42 , in order to make equal the lengths of the passages for the working fluid between the expansion cylinder 42 and the regenerator 52 .
