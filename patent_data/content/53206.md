# Injection assembly.

## Abstract
A tray B having a number of spaced, individually spaced cavities 16 extending downwardly therein in which tubular containers C are removably disposed that contain biological active liquids D . The containers C have open tops in which resilient stoppers E are sealingly disposed. Each stopper E has a longitudinal bore 38a therein that terminates on the upper end 42 in a projecting bubble. Each bubble may be severed from the stopper E with which it is associated by cutting transversely through the base of the bubble with a sharp sterile instrument such as a razor blade or the like. Immediately upon the bubble being severed, an elongate sterile applicator F is removably and sealingly disposed in the bore 38a associated with that bubble. The applicator includes a handle 44 from which a tapered shank 50 projects to terminate in a flat first 52 end from which a number of spaced needle like projections 54 extend, with the projections being of a length that is the depth that is desired to have same penetrate into the skin. When the applicator F is slidably removed from the bore 38a in a stopper E , a predetermined quantity of the biological active liquid D will adhere. When the projections 54 are forced into the skin of a patient the adhering liquid D is transferred to the patient. The first end 52 of the shank acts 50 as a stop by contact with the skin of the patient. The applicator F assures not only that a predetermined amount of liquid D will be injected into a patient, but limits the depth to which such injection will be made. The applicator F after use is discarded, and a new sterile applicator F is inserted in the bore 38a of a stopper E to seal the liquid D in the container C associated with that stopper E from contact with the ambient atmosphere.

## Description
In the proper testing for allergies it is necessary that predetermined quantities of antigens be injected to predetermined depths below the skin of a patient for the physician to note the reaction to such injections. Although numerous devices have been devised and used in the past for making such injections, none of the prior art devices maintain the biological active liquids in hermetically sealed containers that are removably arranged in an identified relationship on a portable tray and include applicators that assure that a nurse will inject but a predetermined quantity of an antigen or other biological active liquid to a predetermined depth below the skin of a user. A major object of the present assembly is to overcome the operational disadvantages of prior art injection devices by providing a portable assembly of hermetically sealed containers for biological liquids that have applicators removably associated therewith that assure but a predetermined quantity of biological active liquid will be injected under the skin of a patient and to a predetermined depth. Another object of the invention is to provide an assembly that is simple and easy to use, may be fabricated from standard commercially available material, and one that permits the efficient injection of predetermined quantities of biological active liquids to predetermined depths under the skin of a patient by nurses and personnel that have but limited experience and skill in making such injections.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a tray having spaced recessed portions in which containers holding biologically active liquids may be removably disposed FIG. 2 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of one of the containers having a stopper mounted therein, which stopper includes an upwardly projecting bubble FIG. 3 is the same view as shown in FIG. 2 but after the bubble has been severed by a sharp instrument such as a razor blade or the like FIG. 4 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of the container and stopper, with an applicator sealingly and removably mounted in a bore that extends through the stopper FIG. 5 is an enlarged perspective view of the free end of the applicator stamp illustrating a number of projections that extend therefrom and which penetrate the skin of a user to inject biological active liquid thereunder, with the depth that the projections penetrate the skin being limited by the flat free end of the stem which acts as a stop when in contact with the skin of the patient FIG. 6 is a fragmentary side elevational view of the lower portion of the stem illustrating the projections that extend therefrom in spaced relationship FIG. 7 is a fragmentary lo ngitudinal cross sectional view of the stem and illustrating the manner in which the projections penetrate the skin and the lower end of the stem acting as a stop to limit the depth of such penetration and FIG. 8 is a perspective view of one of the applicators enclosed in a sterile envelope prior to the applicator being used The invention A as may best be seen in FIG. 1 includes a tray B that is preferably molded from a commercially available polymerized resin. The tray B includes a flat top 10, a pair of side walls 12 that taper downwardly and outwardly therefrom, and a pair of similarly tapered end walls 14. The top 10 has a number of spaced openings 16 defined therein, with cups 18 extending downwardly from the openings and preferably molded as an integral part of the top 10. Each of the cups 18 defines a downwardly extending recess 20. A number of containers C are provided, each of which holds a quantity of a biologically active liquid, such as an antigen or the like. The containers C may be made from a suitable plastic material, glass or the like, and are preferably transparent to permit the quantity of the biological active liquid D to be visualized therein. Each of the containers C includes a cylindrical side wall 24, as may.best be seen in FITS. 2 4 inclusive, which side wall terminates in a semi spherical bottom 26. Each container C has an upper open end 28, and a circumferentially extending bead 30 that projects outwardly from the upper extremity of the side wall 24. A number of stoppers E are provided, each of which is formed from a resilient material such as plastic or the like. Each stopper E includes a cylindrical side wall 32 that has a number of circumferentially extending, longitudinally spaced sealing ribs 34 projecting therefrom.The side wall 32 terminates on the lower end in a transverse ring shaped web 36, which web has a tube 38 extending upwardly from the inner periphery thereof. Each tube terminates on the upper end in a semi circle bubble 40, with the base 40a of the bubble being flush with the upper surface 42 of the side wall 32. A number of applicators F are provided, each of which is disposed within the interior of a sealed sterile transverse envelope G and is shown in FIG. 8 Each applicator F includes a cylindrical handle 44 that has an belong ate stem 46 projecting from one end thereof, with the stem having a downwardly and inwardly tapering side wall 48 as may be seen in FIG. 4. The stem 46 on the lower end thereof develops into a cylindrical portion 50 of reduced diameter, and the portion 50 terminating in a first transverse end 52. A number of circumferentially spaced pointed projections 54 extend from the flat ends 52. VMen the applicator is moved into pressure contact with the skin 56 of a patient not shown the projection 54 penetrates the skin and extends into the flesh 58 of the patient. When the stoppers E are removably disposed in the upper portion of one of the containers C, the sealing ribs 34 are in pressure sealing engagement with the interior of the side wall 32, and the sealing ribs in cooperation with the bubble 40 preventing entry of forei gn material from the ambient atmosphere into the interior of the containers C to contaminate the biological active liquidD therein. The containers C when in this condition are placed in the tray B as shown in FIG. 1, with the identity of the biological active liquid in each container being indicated on one of the labels 22 most adjacent the container. Prior to the invention A being used, a sharp instrument H such as a razor or a knife is used to sever the bubbles 40 from the stopper E at the base 40a of the bubble as illustrated in FIG. 2. After a bubble 40 has been so severed, an applicator F is removed from the envelope G and the stem 46 thereof slid downwardly in the bore 38a as shown in FIG. 4, and the tapered surface 48 of the stem pressure contacting the interior surface 38a of the tube 38 to seal therewith, and prevent contaminants from the atmosphere moving downwardly through the tube 38. The invention A is used as follows The containers C are sterilized and then partially filled with a biological active liquid D as shown in FIGS.2 and 3. Sterile stpppers E are then inserted in the upper open ends of the containers. The containers C as so filled and stopped are placed in the tray B as shown in FIG.1, with the identity of the biological active liquid being indicated on a label secured to the tray adjacent the cup 18 in which the container C is disposed. When it is desired to start using a particular biological active liquid D, the bubble 40 is severed from the stopper E with a sharp instrument H such as a sterile knife, razor blade or the like. When the bubble 40 is so severed an entrance is provided into the bore 38a of tube 38. A number of applicators F are provided each of which is encased in a sterile envelope G. After a bubble 40 has been severed, an applicator F is taken immediately from an envelope G and extended longitudinally downward into a bore 38a. The stem 46 due to the tapered external surface thereof removably seals with the surface 38a of bore 38. The stem 46 is formed of a polymerized resin that will be set by the biological active liquid D, with a film of the liquid adhering to the projections 54. The liquid adhering to the stem surface 48 will be substantially wiped therefrom by contact with tube 38 as the stem is withdrawn through bore 38a and will flow back into container C. When the applicator F is moved into pressure contact with the skin 56 of a patient, the projections 54 will penetrate the same and transfer the film of biological active liquid D adhering thereto to the flesh 58 underlying the skin. The depth the projections 54 can penetrate the skin is limited due to the flat end surface contacting w w w v o v v the skin 56 and acting as a stop. .After an applicator F has been used for an injection it is discarded, and a fresh sterile applicator is inserted in the bore 38a from which the discarded applicator was removed. The applicators F not only serve in cooperation with stoppers E to seal the biological active liquid D in a container C from contact with the ambient atmosphere, but also serve to inject a predetermined quantity of the liquid to a desired depth under the skin of a patient. The liquid D has been referred to generally as biological active and may be one that contains allergens or other materials which when injected give a reaction or produce a desired result for the physician. The use and operation of the invention has been described previously in detail and need not be repeated.
