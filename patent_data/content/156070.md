# MULTISPECTRAL TARGET

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an infrared target made up of a plurality of infrared radiating modules simulates a military asset. The modules 10 have radiating portions that generate infrared signals matching the thermal cues making up the thermal signature of the asset. The modules which comprise laimiantes of an insulating bottom layer 15 an electrically conductive radiating radiating layer 16 connected to wires or busbars 17, 18 and a top layer 19 are designed so that the radiating portion provides an infrared signal of the desired shape and intensity. Visible graphics cover the modules to depict the asset in visible light. A radar corner reflector simu lates the asset to radar apparatus.
