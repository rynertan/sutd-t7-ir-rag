# Method for reducing oligomeric cyclic ether content of a polymerizate.

## Abstract
The oligomeric cyclic ether content of a tetrahydrofuran , an alkylene oxide , or a tetrahydrofuran alkylene oxide polymerizate can be reduced by bringing the polymerizate into contact with an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon of 6 8 carbon atoms.
