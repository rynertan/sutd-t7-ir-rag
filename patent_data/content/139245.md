# DAISY WHEEL PRINTER

## Abstract
A daisy wheel printer having a platen 70 , a translatable carriage 200, 300 , a pair of parallel support rods 33, 40 for the carriage, a pressure roller control mechanism 72, 122 , and electro mechanical drive mechanisms 57, 90 , for the carriage 200, 300 and the platen 70 has a unitary cast base member 21 incorporating all of the support members 31, 32, 41, 65, 77, 78, 10 required for these elements. The unitary base member 21 also integrally incorporates a support platform 26 for the electrical power components, a separate integral chamber for the electronic control compo nents, and a thermally conductive heat sink 1201 for conduct ing away heat generated by the electrical components. The unitary base member 21 also provides electro magnetic radiation shielding and static discharge protection without the need for additional shielding or ground compo nents. The carriage assembly 200, 300 for the printing ele ment includes a one piece die cast lower support brace 201, 202 , and an upper carriage assembly 300 incorporating the detachable ribbon cartridge drive mechanism and a simple one piece ribbon latching device. The printer further features an easily removable paper defector 110 and an improved pressure roller assembly 140...143 .
