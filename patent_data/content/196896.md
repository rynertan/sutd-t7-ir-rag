The composition is spread on an area of skin having hair, the coating is allowed to dry naturally or by treating with hot air and or by absorbing water into an absorbent sheet pressed onto the film and the film is peeled off with the hairs embedded therein, optionally with use of a presure sensitive adhesive sheet placed on the film.
