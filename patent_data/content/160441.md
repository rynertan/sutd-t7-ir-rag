## Description
DESCRIPTION APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING AND LOCATING INFORMATION ABOUT AN EVENT This invention relates to methods and apparatus for detecting and obtaining information about particularly locating changes in variables.Introduction to the Invention A number of methods have been proposed for use to detect changes in variables along an elongate path, e.g. the occurrence of a leak of water or another liquid or gas , insufficient or excessive pressure, too high or too low a temperature, the presence or absence of light or another form of electromagnetic radiation, or a change in the physical position of a movable member, e.g. a valve in a chemical process plant or a window in a building fitted with a burglar alarm system. Changes of this kind are referred to in this specification by the generic term event . Reference may be made for example to U. S. Patents Nos.1,084,910, 2,581,213, 3,248,646, 3,384,493, 3,800,216, and 3,991,413, U.K. Patent No. 1,481,850 and German Offenlegungschriften Nos. 3,001,150.0 and 3,225,742. The application corresponding to U.S. Serial Nos.509,897 and 599,047, describes an improved method and apparatus for monitoring for the occurrence of an event, and for detecting and obtaining information about the event upon its occurrence i.e. as soon as it occurs or at some time after it has occurred . In that method, upon occurrence of the event, an electrical connection is made between a source member and a locating member of known impedance character istics, the connection s being effective at a first point at which the event takes place or whose location is defined by some other characteristic of the event . A current of known size is then driven through the electrical connection and down the locating member to a second point whose location is known. The voltage drop between the first and second points is measured and the location of the first point can then be determined. The application corresponding to U.S. Serial No.599,048 describes a system which is somewhat similar to that just described, but differs from it in that a the source member is connected to the locating member, so that current can pass through the locating member in the absence of an event, and, b upon occurrence of the event, electrical connection is made between the locating member and the return member. The application corresponding to U.S. Serial Nos.556,740 and 556,829 describes preferred ways of assembling the locating, return and source members in the two methods just described, at least one of the members having a wrapped configuration. In the two methods just described, a key requirement is that a current of known size or magnitude is driven down the locating member. One way of fulfilling this requirement is to provide a current source which outputs a known and constant current. Another way is to monitor a varying current, e.g. by way of an ammeter, so that the current is known at all times. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have now discovered that great benefits can be obtained, in the two systems just described, by providing a reference impedance connected in series with the locating member. When an event takes place, the voltage drop between the first and second points on the locating member, and the voltage drop across the reference impedance, are compared, and the location of the event is determined from that comparison. In this way, variations in the size of the current do not have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the location. This is important even when using a so called constant current source, because such sources can fluctuate in amplitude, e.g. from 4 to 4 of a reference amplitude, particularly at the low currents, e.g. less than 12 milliamps, preferably 1 to 250 microamps, preferably employed in very long systems.When using a constant voltage source, the need for an ammeter is eliminated. In one aspect, the invention provides a method for monitoring for the occurrence of an event, and for detecting and obtaining information about the event upon its occurrence, which method comprises providing a system in which, upon occurrence of the event, 1 electrical connection is made between an electri cally conductive locating member and an electri cally conductive second member the connection to the locating member being effec tive at a first point whose location is defined by at least one characteristic of the event the making of the connection enabling the formation of a test circuit which comprises that part of the locating member between the first point and a second point on the locating member having a known location, and in which an electrical current is transmitted between the first and second points on the locating member that part of the locating member between the first point and the second point being connected in series with a reference impedance which has a known impedance and the current through which has a known relationship with the current through that part of the locating member and the current, the reference impedance and the locating member being such that, by obtaining a ratio between a first voltage drop across the reference impedance and a second voltage drop between the first and second points on the locating member, the spatial relationship between the first and second points can be determined 2 the ratio of the first and second voltage drops is obtained and 3 information concerning the event is obtained from the ratio in step 2 . In another aspect, the invention comprises an apparatus for use in the method described above which comprises 1 an elongate electrically conductive locating member whose impedance from one end to any point on the locating member defines the spatial relationship between that end and that point 2 an elongate electrically conductive second member 3 an event sensitive connection means which, upon occurrence of an event, effects electrical connection between the locating member and the second member, the connection being effective at a first point on the locating member which is defined by at least one characteristic of the event 4 an electrically conductive third member 5 a reference impedance which has a known impedence and which is connected in series with said locating member 6 a power source which, at least when occurrence of an event causes electrical connection to be made between the locating and second members, causes a current to be transmitted i between the first point and a second point which is at one end of the locating member, and ii through said reference impedance 7 a first voltage measuring device for determining a first voltage drop across said reference impedance, 8 a second voltage measuring device for determining a second voltage drop between the first and second points and 9 a divider which provides a ratio between said first and second voltage drops. In another aspect, the present invention provides a device which is suitable for use in a method and apparatus as described above and which comprises 1 three terminals A,B,C 2 a reference impedance which has a known impedance and which is connected between terminals A and C 3 a first voltage measuring device connected across said reference impedance 4 a second voltage measuring device connected across terminals A and B and 5 a divider which provides a ratio between said first and second voltage drops whereby, when 1 terminal A is connected to one end of an elongate electrically conductive locating member whose impedance from one end to any point on the locating member defines the spatial relationship between that end and that point 2 terminal C is connected to a power source, the power source also being connected to an elongate electrically conductive source member which is adjacent the locating member and becomes connected thereto if, but only if, an event takes place, the connection being effective at a first point on the locating member which is defined by at least one characteristic of the event and 3 terminal B is connected to an electrically conductive return member, the return member also being connected to the far end of the locating member, there is obtained an apparatus as defined above in which occurrence of an event effects connection between the source and locating members. The same device can be used in apparatus in which occurrence of an event effects connection between the return and locating members. The term divider is used herein to denote any device which obtains from the measurements of the voltage drops the desired information about the event. The device and apparatus of the invention preferably also contain a display which is activated by the divider when it provides a ratio between the first and second voltage drops. The device can also usefully comprise a fourth terminal D to which, when the device is in use, the power supply and the source member are connected. The device can also contain a component which, when the device is connected to an external power supply, will modify the power in a desired way. The device can also contain a power source, and in this case, the terminal C, when the device is in use, is connected to the source member. The various components of the device can be mounted on a support member and covered by a housing, the terminals being exposed or the housing being removable to expose the terminals for connection. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1 and 2 are schematic circuit diagrams of the method and apparatus of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is particularly useful in the apparatus comprising elongate locating, source and return members hereinafter referred to as a locating assembly over path lengths that extend a considerable distance. For inherently safe systems, a voltage of not more than 24 volts is preferred, with voltages below 10 volts being particularly preferred. This results in very low currents in very long systems, in particular currents at which controlled current sources exhibit substantial variation up to 4 from the fixed current . Thus this invention is of particular value when the current is below 12 milliamps, e.g. 1 to 250 microamps.One may employ the present invention in the same general way as is disclosed in the earlier applications, but with the advantage that elongate location and second members can now have lengths substantially greater e.g. at least 2 times greater, sometimes at least 3 times greater or even at least 5 times greater than the elongate member lengths heretofore disclosed. The invention preferably makes use of two voltage measuring devices, one measuring the first voltage drop V1 across the reference impedance, the other measuring the second voltage drop V2 down the locating member.Alternatively, a single voltage measuring device can be used together with a switch means, to measure sequentially the first and second voltage drops. The switching speed should be faster than any current size variations, so that V1 andV2 are measured at the same current. The invention makes use of a divider for providing a ratio between V1 and V2, and preferably also a display, preferably digital, for displaying the ratio obtained.Conventional dividers, switching means and displays can be used for this purpose. In a preferred embodiment, the currents transmitted between the first and second points and through the reference impedance are the same, and the divider provides a ratio of the function Z V12, where ZR is the magnitude of the reference impedance, and expresses the result, in some convenient units, as the distance d to an event location, since d is proportional to the function. By changing the size of the reference impedance, it is easy to adjust the apparatus for changes in one or more of the following variables 1 the length of the locating member 2 the units in which the distance to the first point is displayed 3 the voltmeters employed and their various scale factors, bearing in mind that full scale deflec tion of the meter preferably corresponds to the full length of the locating member. It is important that the reference impedance has a known, fixed value under the conditions of operation.Accordingly, the reference impedance preferably has a temperature coefficient of impedance which averages less than 0.003 per degree C over the temperature range 0 to 1000c. The reference impedance preferably has resistance and no reactance, the resistance being preferably 0.01 to 100, especially 0.1 to 10, particularly 0.5 to 2 times the resistance of the full length of the locating member. For example the resistance in ohms may be 0.5 to 1.0 times, e.g.0.6 to 0.8 times the length of the system in meters. The devices of the invention can include two or more reference impedances each of impedance, and switching means for selecting one or more of the reference impedances so that, when the device is in use, a reference impedance of the desired size is provided. Referring now to the drawing, Figures 1 and 2 schematically represent preferred embodiments of the present invention. A device 10 includes terminals A, B, C and D. A reference impedance ZR, which may be selected from a set of reference impedances ZRlt ZR2, is connected across terminalsA and C. In Figure 1, first and second conventional voltage measuring devices are connected across terminals A and C, and across terminals A and B respectively. In Figure 2, on the other hand, one voltage measuring device is employed and is connected sequentially across the terminals A and C, andA and B by way of a conventional switch means, shown functinally by way of the dotted lines. In both Figures, the voltage measuring devices are connected to a conventional divider DIV , in turn connected to a conventional display DIS . The device 10 is connected to a location assembly 12 and a power supply 14 a constant current supply in Figure 1 and a constant voltage supply in Figure 2 . Locating memberL having an end point 2 of the location assembly 12 is connected to terminal A and second and third members sourceS and return R are connected to terminals D and B respectively. Also, one lead of the power supply 14 is connected to terminal D, while a second power supply lead is connected to terminal C. The components of the assembly 12 are differently connected in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1 the return and locating members are electrically connected together permanently at the far end and an event E connects the locating member and the source member at the point 1. In Figure 2, on the other hand, the source and locating members are electrically connected together permanently at the far end and an event E connects the locating member and return member at the point 1.
