## Description
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for incinerating waste matter, reducing the volume of material to be disposed of, and treating secondary waste matter by utilizing microwave energy. Due to rapid changes in the patterns of daily life and industrial activity and the material consumption related thereto, the volume of waste material generated by the public and by industry is increasing year by year. Several ways have been proposed for disposing of such waste matter by way of land reclamation and burning, etc. However, depending on the nature of the waste matter in question, the procedures heretofore applied are not totally suitable because of the possibility of pollution with respect to certain materials involved. For instance, the waste matter discharged from nuclear power plants has been stored in tanks provided within the plants because of concern regarding environmental pollution. Such waste matters include spent ion exchange resins granule or powder , spent filtering materials, spent active carbon, filters cellulose, synthetic and precoating material, etc. However, the volume of such waste matter being stored is increasing, and thus, it has been desired that an effective way of disposing of such waste matter be developed. To such end, it has been proposed that microwave energy be utilized in order to directly irradiate the waste matter with microwaves so as to heat and incinerate the waste matter. For example, one of such proposals is disclosed in JP A 253899 1985. However, if such an incinerator as above using microwave energy is employed to incinerate the waste matter referred to above, the following drawbacks are observed. That is From DE A 31 09 513 a method and an apparatus for heat treatment of a material is known. According to this method and apparatus a material to be heat treated is located together with spherical bodies in a container made of microwave reflecting material. Said spherical bodies consist in substance of a material which is transmissive for the microwaves. The material to be treated and the spherical bodies are subjected to the microwaves, while a movement is imparted onto said spherical bodies, so as to heat and treat said material. Accordingly, it has been desired to have an improved method and apparatus of efficiently and satisfactorily disposing of waste matter including high molecule plastics and other waste matter. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus for disposing of waste matter efficiently by utilizing microwave energy. The above object is accomplished according to the present invention by providing a method and an apparatus, respectively, as set forth in claim 1 and claims 4 or 5, respectively. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims. Thus, if the secondary waste matter derived from the incineration such as gas, tar, soot, etc. is to be processed in order to reduce pollution or to keep the discharge duct clean, another furnace is provided for treatment of such secondary waste matter, again by irradiating microwaves, wherein the wall of the furnace is arranged or a bed of material is disposed in the furnace such as to exhibit the ability to absorb microwaves so as to raise the temperature thereof to a degree sufficient to be capable of burning or pyrolysing the secondary waste matter. This second furnace, if it is provided, is coupled to the incinerator in such a manner that it may receive the secondary waste matter therefrom. It will thus be clear that the waste matter is incinerated, burnt or pyrolysed through the presence of materials which are heated by absorbing microwave energy. By using microwave energy in accordance with the present invention, difficulty in disposing of waste matter such as that, in particular, which is discharged from nuclear power plants is solved without causing any serious problem. Further objects, effects and advantages of the present invention will become more clear when the ensuing description is reviewed with reference to the accompanying drawings, a brief explanation of which is summarized below. Referring now to Fig. 1, there is schematically illustrated an incinerator 1 according to the present invention. In this drawing, 2 designates an exhaust opening for gas generated by the incineration, 3 an intake wave guide duct for introducing microwaves, 4 a feeder for supplying waste matter into the incinerator, 5 a hearth plate, 6 a layer consisting of granules exhibiting the ability to absorb microwaves, 7 an agitator, 7 an agitator blade, 8 a shaft for mounting blades 7 , 9 nozzles for supplying air required for incineration, 10, 10 , pipes for air supply and 11 a discharge opening for residue. M₁ is a motor for driving the agitator 7 through the shaft 8 and M₂ is a motor for driving the feeder 4. The granules for the layer 6 are materials which exhibit properties of good absorption of microwaves and good resistance to heat and are selected from materials such as silicone carbide SiC , titanium dioxide TiO₂ , ilmenite, balium titanate BaTiO₃ , ferric oxide Fe₂O₃ , a combination of silicon carbide and silicon nitride SiC Si₃N₄ , zirconium oxide ZrO₂ , calcium oxide CaO and sand, etc. Among these materials, silicon carbide, titanium dioxide, ilmenite, barium titanate and ferric oxide, particularly silicon carbide and titanium dioxide are preferred from the view point of microwave absorption properties. The size of these granules is preferably in the order of 1 to 7 mm and more preferably in the range between 2 mm and 5 mm. The thickness of the layer 6 may vary depending on the size of the agitator 7 but it is generally sufficient if it is 300 mm or more. The agitator 7 is preferably arranged so that the upper ends of the blades 7 become buried to a depth of 1 cm or more below the surface of the layer 6 when the agitator 7 is kept stationary. For the operation of this incinerator 1, the motor M₁ is actuated to drive the agitator 7 and, thence, microwaves are irradiated over the layer 6 through the duct 3 so that the layer 6 of the granules will be heated by absorption of the microwaves. When the temperature of the layer 6 is raised beyond 500 C, air is supplied through nozzles 9 into the incinerator 1 and then the waste matter is supplied by the feeder 4 on the top of the layer 6 so that the waste matter is incinerated in the presence of the heated granules. Because the waste matter is supplied over the granules which have reached a high temperature, waste matter is spread over the granules. In particular, high molecular polymeric items are evenly distributed in a thin layer over the granules whereby the heating rate of these items is rapid and air uniformly supplied from the bottom efficiently contacts these items. Accordingly, in comparison with the prior art, the amount of air needing to be supplied is relatively small and thus the amount of gas generated by the incineration is also relatively small so it is easy to dispose of such generated gas. In cases where further treatment of such generated gas is required, another furnace is provided which will be explained later. The rotational speed of the agitator 7 is preferably in the range of 5 to 20 r.p.m. but this depends on the size of the incinerator. The driving mechanism for the agitator 7 is preferably arranged in the lower part of the incinerator since, if the blade or other elements are exposed over the bed 6, such elements would act to reflect microwaves away from the target area. The blades 7 are mounted on the shaft 8 at such an angle as to reduce resistance against the layer of granules. Such angle may, for example, be less than 30 relative to the vertical axis of the shaft 8 since if such angle is made larger than, for example, 30 , such orientation of the blades will cause reflection of microwaves which is not desirable. The material of the blades is preferably, permeable to the microwaves and ceramics are one of the preferred materials for the blades 7 . The size of the blades may vary depending on the size of the incinerator but in most cases, it is usually about 300 mm in length and about 30 80 mm in width. Also the depth of the bed is preferably around in the order of 300 mm. This also varies depending on the size of the incinerator. With respect to the location of the agitator 7 in the lower portion of the incinerator, there is the further advantage that the construction of the upper portion of the incinerator is made relatively free in design terms and, if necessary, a secondary treating means is easily coupled thereat for processing gaseous secondary waste matter produced by the incineration. In Fig. 2, further details of the agitator 7 are illustrated. The shaft 8 is enclosed in a baffle structure for preventing residue or other foreign materials from entering into a shaft gland seal 16, preventing microwaves from leaking out of the incinerator and providing passage for an inlet port 17 for introducing cooling air. In order to improve the sealing effect, an alternative arrangement for the agitator is shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, a rotary element 18 is attached to the lower end of the shaft and disposed on the hearth 5 so as to be rotated by a generator 19 for producing a rotary magnetic field, the generator being disposed under the hearth 5. The nozzles 9 may be made in several forms suitable for supplying air into the incinerator 1. A porous ceramic pad may be one suitable for such purpose. An examplary way of installing such pad is illustrated in Fig. 4. A suitable number of nozzles or pads 9 are detachably mounted in the hearth 5 so as to uniformly supply air into the incinerator. When the pad 9 become clogged, it is replaced. Clogging may be detected by, for example, variation of the flow rate in the air supply duct 10 . After the incinerating operation is finished, residue may be discharged outwardly together with the microwave absorbing granules through the discharge opening 11 by rotating the agitator blades 7 . The microwave absorbing granules may be returned into the incinerator 1 after being separated from the residue. As touched upon earlier, if secondary waste matter is produced to such an extent as to require further treatment such as, for example, where the amount of exhaust gas containing harmful or combustible constituents, tar and soot, etc. is relatively large, such secondary wastes must be further burnt or pyrolysed and a furnace has been devised for treating such secondary waste matter by utilizing microwave energy. Such furnace may preferably be coupled with the exhaust opening of the incinerator. Such furnace 20 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, 21 designates an inlet opening for receiving gaseous wastes into the furnace 20, 22 a discharge opening, 23 an intake duct for introducing microwaves into the furnace 20, 24 a heat insulating layer, 25 a layer consisting of granules, pieces of plate or lumps of certain materials exhibiting the ability to absorb microwaves, 26 a high temperature furnace chamber, 27 an upper chamber of the furnace and 28 a hearth plate for supporting the layer 25 and provided with a plurality of perforations permitting the passage of the exhaust gas discharged from the incinerator. The materials used for the layer are the same as those discussed in connection with the layer 6 in Fig. 1. The size of the granules for the layer 25 is preferably in the range of about 5 mm to 10 cm and the thickness of the layer 25 is preferably about 100 mm 300 mm. The hearth plate 28 may be made of microwave absorbing material in order to prevent microwaves from leaking through the inlet opening 21. With the irradiation of the microwaves onto the layer 25, the layer is heated to a high temperature and the combustible gas and constituents of the secondary gaseous exhaust received through the intake opening 21 are heated by the layer 25 and satisfactorily burnt in the furnace chamber 26. By controlling microwaves, the layer 25 may be easily heated to a high temperature such as 900 C or more, and it is thus possible to substantially burn tar or the like contained in the exhaust gas from the incineration of waste plastics and to pyrolyse ammonia or cyanogen, etc. contained in the same gas. In Fig. 6, another alternative embodiment of the furnace 30 for treating secondary gaseous waste is schematically shown. In this drawing, 31 designates an inlet opening for introducing gaseous wastes to be processed, 32 an exhaust opening, 33 an intake duct for introducing microwaves, 34 a heat insulating member, 35 a furnace wall made of microwave absorbing material, 36 a hearth plate made of microwave absorbing material and provided with passages for gaseous waste matter, 37 a perforated plate made of heat resistant and microwave permeable material for allowing passage of gas, 38 a high temperature furnace chamber and 39 an upper furnace chamber. Microwaves introduced through the duct 33 pass the perforated plate 37 and are absorbed by the wall 35 and the hearth plate 36 whereby they are heated to a high temperature and, thus, the temperature of the chamber 38 is raised to a high level by heat radiation from the wall 35 and the hearth plate 36. Therefore, gaseous secondary waste matter introduced through the inlet opening 31 into the furnace chamber 38 will be heated by the heat radiation and the combustible gas or other constituents contained therein are burnt due to the presence of oxygen which is also contained in the gaseous waste matter while other gases may be pyrolysed. The gas processed by the furnace is then discharged outwardly from the exhaust opening 32 through the upper furnace chamber 39. The perforated plate 37, which is heat resistant and permeable to microwaves, is provided so as to improve the heating efficiency by radiant heat, though it may be made out of quartz and silicon nitride, etc. or it may be made of a material containing alumina which exhibits a slight degree of absorption of microwaves. Further improvement may be expected by shaping the upper furnace chamber 39 in Fig. 6 in the form shown as 39a in Fig. 7 wherein the portion near the intake duct 33 is given a taper and, with this construction, microwaves are smoothly introduced all over the furnace and reflection of the microwaves from the high temperature furnace chamber is reduced. Also, in a case where it is desired to direct a relatively large amount of microwaves towards the lower part of the high temperature furnace chamber 38 in order to promote burning efficiency by particularly raising the temperature of this part, a metallic cylinder 35a may be arranged at the upper wall portion of this chamber as schematically shown in Fig. 7. The metallic cylinder 35a effectively reflects the microwaves to the lower part of the furnace. In a case where it is desired to couple the incinerator and furnace explained above, such is achieved, for example, by connecting the exhaust opening 2 of the incinerator 1 Fig. 1 with the inlet opening 31 of the furnace 30 Fig. 6 and such combination is schematically illustrated in Fig. 8. As discussed in connection with Fig. 1, the upper portion of the incinerator 1 is made relatively simple due to the location of the agitator, and such coupling is thus achieved quite conveniently. Most of the reference numerals in Fig. 8 are the same as those employed in Figs. 1 and 6 and they indicate the same function as those previously used. Therefore, reference should be made to the explanation given with respect to the same reference numerals in Figs. 1 and 6. In Fig. 8, additional reference numerals are as follows. Actuation of the generators 40 and 41 generates microwaves which are directed to the incinerator 1 and the furnace 30 through the wave guides 42 and 43, respectively. The respective operations of the incinerator 1 and the furnace 30 are the same as that explained hereinbefore. In addition to the above, air is supplied to the wave guides 42 and 43 by air supplying conduits 44 and 45 so that back flow of the exhaust gas is prevented from flowing towards the generators 40 and 41. Members 46 and 47 are arranged in the wave guides 42 and 43 upstream of the inlet ports of air for the wave guides, respectively, with respect to the guiding direction of the microwaves, the members 46 and 47 being made of a material which is permeable to microwaves but impermeable to air. It is to be noted that, in this system illustrated in Fig. 8, air necessary for the process in the furnace 30 is also supplied through the air conduit 44, wave guide 42 and inlet duct 3 into the upper portion of the incinerator 1 and such air is directed upwardly into the furnace 30. With the arrangement shown in Fig. 8, waste matter is effectively and substantially completely processed. Thus, the incinerator 1 serves as a primary processor for incinerating the wastes and the furnace 30 serves as a secondary processor for burning and pyrolysing the gaseous secondary products generated by the incineration in the primary processor so that the gas finally discharged from the exhaust opening 32 is made relatively free from any substances which would be of concern in relation to the problem of pollution. Employing an incinerator corresponding to that shown in Fig. 1 and a furnace corresponding to that shown in Fig. 6, tests were conducted, the data of the incinerator and furnace being given below. Three different categories of waste matter were incinerated. A mixture of granular cation exchange resin strong acid H type and granular anion exchange resin strong basic OH type was prepared in a mixing ratio of 1 1 by volume . In order to simulate the characteristics of normal waste matter, crud material was added to the mixture in a quantity of 0.005 Kg net Fe per kilogram of the dried mixture. The added crud material comprised Fe₃O₄ and Fe₂O₃ in a ratio of 3 2. The above mixture was satisfactorily and continuously incinerated under the following conditions. Air supplied for incineration 14 Nm³ one Kg of dried granular resin A mixture of strong acid powdered resin H type and strong basic powdered resin OH type was prepared in a mixing ratio of 2 1. Other factors were the same as 1 including the addition of crud material. A mixture of waste paper, waste cloth and plastics rubber, polyethylene, vinyl chrolide etc. was prepared in a ratio of 35 35 30 by weight, respectively. In the incineration tests, it was observed that, if the amount of material charged into the incinerator was increased, the incineration temperature remained at over 650 C even if the irradiation of microwaves was stopped due to the self thermal calory produced by the matter incinerated. For instance, ion exchange resin produces about 6500 Kcal Kg when it is incinerated. After burning granular ion exchange resin, it was found that the weight of the resultant residue was reduced to 1 150 to 1 200 of the original weight of the resin. The gas generated by the incineration was processed by the furnace which was installed at the top of the incinerator as schematically shown in Fig. 8. The exhaust gas generated by the test A 1 was processed by the furnace under the conditions summarized below. After passing through the furnace, the composition of the discharged gas became as follows. ppm From the foregoing description, it would have become clear that the present invention provides a method and apparatus for disposing of waste matter satisfactorily by employing microwave energy, which method and apparatus facilitate control of the operation due to the employment of microwaves.
