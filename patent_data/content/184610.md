# SELF ADHESIVE LABELS

## Abstract
The invention discloses self adhesive labels in roll form which are for the high speed application to moving articles. A base web material is coated on one side with release material such as a polymerisable silicone resin, and on only a fraction of the other side with pressure sensitive adhesive, to enhace release of the web during unrolling and to prevent extrusion of the adhesive out of the end of the roll. The web has sprocket holes for controlling the feed of same through an applicator machine which preferably cuts the individual labels from the web leaving a skeletal waste.
