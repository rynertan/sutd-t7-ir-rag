# Improvements in or relating to support and drive members.

## Abstract
A support and driving member comprises an open framework comprising a helical strip 38 supported by a series of support members 39 extending longitudinally of the helical strip and internally thereof. The member may be incorporated in a shower unit that comprises a tubular housing 1 with a longitudinal slot 6 , the driving member 16 being located coaxially within the housing and mounted for rotation about its longitudinal axis. A driving motor 15 housed in an end cap 8 has an output shaft 24 that rotates the member 16 . Mounted on the member 16 for move ment along the latter is a nozzle carrier 5 carrying an air nozzle 41 and a water nozzle that discharge through the slot 6 . The nozzles are connected via flexible supply lines SL within the housing 1 to inlets 34 for treatment fluids.
