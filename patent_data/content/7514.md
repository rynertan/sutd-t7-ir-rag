# Melt processable fluorine containing resin composition.

## Abstract
A melt processabie fluorine containing resin composi tion having an improved thermal stability which comprises A a tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, a chlorotrif luoroethylene homo or co polymer, or a vinylidene fluoride homo or co polymer and B a mixture, as a thermal stabil izer, of a an amine antioxidant, b an organosulfurous com pound and at least one member selected from the group consisting of c carbon black and d metal powder of Group VIII of the Perodic Table. The composition can be advantage ously processed without causing any trouble even at an optimum sintering temperature of the fluorine containing resin. Figure 1 is a graph showing the sintering of such resin compositions under varied temperature and time conditions.
