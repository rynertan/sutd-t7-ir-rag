# Method of making heat curable adhesive coated insulation for transformers.

## Abstract
Flexible resin adhesive coated substrates made by coat ing a sheet material with a wet, heat reactive adhesive resin, containing a monomer and an amount of an ultraviolet radia tion sensitive photoinitiator effective to cause polymerization of monomer in response to ultraviolet radiation, and applying ultraviolet radiation to the adhesive resin coating on the sheet material to polymerize monomer with the application of heat, forming a dry, uncured coating of adhesive bonded to the sheet material.
