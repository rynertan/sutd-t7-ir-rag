# Cochlear implant system for an auditory prosthesis.

## Abstract
A cochlear implant system includes an electrode array 1 comprising multiple platinum ring electrodes in a silastic car rier to be implanted in the cochlea of the ear. A receiver stimulator 3 containing a semiconductor integrated circuit and other components is implanted in the patient adjacent the ear to receive data information and power through tuned coil 5 using an inductive link 6 from a patient wearable external speech processor 7 including an integrated circuit and vari ous components which is configured or mapped to emit data signals from an EPROM programmed to suit each patient electrical stimulation perceptions through testing of the patient and his implanted stimulator electrode using a diag nostic and programming unit 12 connected to the processor by an interface unit 10 . The system allows use of various speech processing strategies including dominant spectral peak and amplitude and compression of voice pitch so as to include voiced sounds, unvoiced glottal sounds and prosodic information.
