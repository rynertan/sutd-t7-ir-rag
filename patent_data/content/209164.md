## Description
The present invention relates generally to a control device which is so arranged that manual control movements give rise to electrical signals that serve to adjust a controlled element, comprising a body part that forms a supporting surface which is intende to support the hand of an operator while the control movements are being carried out, a control stick which extends outward from the supporting surface and comprises two stick parts arranged one after the other in the lengthwise direction of the control stick, of which the inner stick part is fixed to the body part while the outer stick part, upon which the control movements are performed, is movable laterally relative to the inner stick part to and from a neutral position, wherein the stick parts are so arranged that a control movement which is performed on the outer stick part takes place as a swinging about a center or a zone that is located in a cavity in the control stick and within that part of it that is gripped by the operator s hand when it is supported by the supporting surface, and a signal emitting device in operative connection with the outer stick part and the controlled element for generating signals for adjusting the element in dependence upon the control movements. A control device of this type is known from Swedish Patent No. 8203351 5 wherein the center about which the control stick swings is defined by a universal joint which connects the outer stick part with the inner and permits control movements about two swinging axes. The dimensions of the stick are suitable for its being embraced by a hand, and it is evident that the interior space in such a control stick must be small. This makes it difficult to build in a universal joint, which is required to have good strength as well as freedom from loose play. It is almost impossible to provide enough space in the cavity in the stick for a signal emitting device in addition to such a universal joint. One way of solving this structural problem is to dispose the signal emitting devices outside the stick part itself. Such a control device is described in Swedish Patent No. 8203350 7. In this control device stick movements are transferred to the signal emitters by means of a link system which, as is apparent from the drawings, occupies a large space and has a heavy weight. In connection with an aircraft this is not desirable. In addition, there is propably an increased risk of play or binding owing to several links being activated during use. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a control device wherein the complicated and expensive universal joint is replaced by a simpler and more compact device which thus leaves place for the signal emitting device also within the control stick. This object is achieved by means of a control device wherein both stick parts are connected with one another by means of a rod shaped spring element extending centrally through the cavity in the lengthwise direction of the control stick, which defines the neutral position and the above mentioned center or zone of swinging and which, during a swinging movement of the outer stick part away from the neutral position produces, through a corresponding elastic deflection sidewardly, an opposing moment that tends to return the stick portion to the neutral position, and that the signal emitting device is enclosed in the cavity slongside the spring element and arranged to sense the position of the outer stick part relative to the inner stick part. The invention is now more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein A number of application fields can be thought of for the invention. In the drawings there is illustrated an example of an airplane application wherein the control device is employed for maneuvering a radar antenna. Other fields in which a control device of the type that the invention relates to can be used are for example sighting devices, land vehicles, vessels, industrial robots, loaders and digging machines. The control device illustrated in the drawings comprises a body part 1 that can be stationary or movable in an airplane wherein, in the latter case, the control device can be arranged in the airplace cabin as disclosed in Swedish patent No. 8203351 5. The top of the body part forms a supporting surface 2. In the direction outward from the latter there extends a control stick 3 that comprises two parts arranged one after the other in the lengthwise direction of the stick, namely an inner part 4 that is immovably secured to the body part 1 and an outer part 5 that is swingable relative to the inner part. During control movements, that is, when the outer stick part is caused to swing relative to the inner stick part, the supporting surface 2 constitutes support for an operator s hand and thereby provides a reference for precise control movements. The two stick parts are coupled together by means of a rod shaped spring element 6 that extends centrally through a cavity 7 through the stick. The spring element 6 has its one end secured by a transverse rib 9 or the like belonging to the outer movable stick part 5 and has its other end securely clamped in a rib element in the body parts 1 that can be located at approximately the level of the supporting surface 2. In its unloaded condition the spring element defines the neutral position of the control stick, that is, the position that is shown in the drawing. The characteristic of the spring element and thus of the control stick is determined by the magnitude of bowing stiffness of the spring element and also by the location of the point or zone about which the outer stick part swings for control movements. These two parameters are in turn determined by the cross section area and geometry of the element, and also by the variation in cross section along the free length of the element. In these respects the invention aims at a configuration of the control stick which is as good as poissible ergonometrically, and for this it is important that the resistance moment of the spring element 6, considered im the various directions of swinging that may be able to occur, is well balanced to the physiological conditions under which an operator exerts force upon the control stick in his hand. These conditionsd are in fact not equally good in all directions. By reason of this the control device in the preferred embodiments shown in the drawings has a spring element 5 with an elliptical cross section. With respect to the mentioned physiological conditions, the cross section ought to be so oriented that the minor axis of the ellipse and the resistance moment of the spring element that is related to it applied during sideward control movements when a force F acts as in Figs. 2 and 5 and the operator performs a turning of the hand and forearm. In this first degree of freedom of the control stick it is harder for him to exert muscular force than when he bends his hand in a movement forward or backward and the stick is given a force F , see Figs. 1 and 4. In the second degree of freedom the stick should therefore have a larger resistance moment corresponding to the major axis of the ellipse. The spring element 6 can suitably have a constant cross section area long the whole of its free length as the drawing shows. If a maneuvering force is applied in any arbitrary direction perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the stick and at the elevation of the transverse rib 9, the center or zone 8 of swinging of the spring element will be located at one third of the free length from the securement point in the body part 1. Other forms of the spring element are possible as alternatives, for example a conical or pyramidal downwardly increasing cross section area, through which the mentioned center or zone of turning will be located at a different place along the spring element. When the stick is maneuvered it is so grasped by the operator s hand that the two parts of the stick are embraced, whereby at least the little finger surrounds the inner part 4 and the hand is supported against the supporting surface 2. With this the center or zone 8 of swinging of the stick will be located in the middle of the gripping position of the hand. When the stick is taken out of its neutral position the spring element gives rise to stick forces that tend to return the stick to its neutral position. For generation of signals that represent the position of the outer stick in relation to the inner one, a signal emitting element is arranged, according to a charactertistic of the invention, alongside the spring element 6. Various solutions based upon various types of position sensors can thus be employed in the control device. In Figs. 1 3 is shown a solution wherein four strain gauges 10 are mounted on surfaces 11 that are provided for the purpose at the level of t above mentioned center or zone 8 of swinging. In the peripheral direction these surfaces and sensors are aranged pair wise in the directions of the major axis andf the minor axis, respectively, of the spring element, so that two of the sensors react to movements in the one direction forward backward while the other sensor pair senses movements in the other direction sidewardly . the four strain gages consequently produce voltages which show how the stick is swung out from its neutral position in the respective directions and which, after assembly, represent the angular position and the direction that the outer stick part 5 assumes in relation to the inner part 4. The signal is proportional to the position with a good approximation, in every case with the small angles of deflection of about 3 5 that are usually involved in connection with an airplane. In Figs. 4 6 is shown a solution with signal producing devices 15 in the form of two differential transformers 16 of the RVDT rotary variable differential transformer type, which are mounted on the inside of the stationary stick part by means of fill ins 17. The sensors are so mounted that their rotatable elements have their axes of rotation extending through the center or zone 8 of swinging of the spring element. The axes form a 90 angle with one another and, if the spring cross section is elliptical, they should also coincide with the major axis and the minor axis, respectively. The movements of the movable stick part 5 in each degree of freedom are transferred from the securement element 9 by means of a feeler 18 which is formed as a leaf spring and is stiff in a plane transverse to the axis of rotation of the differential transformer but is flexible in the direction transverse ot that plane. In consequence, each feeler 18 faithfully transfers to the differential transformer 16 a movement or motion component in the place just mentioned. Stick movements in the last mentioned direction or components thereof, on the other hand, do not affect the same differential transformer. The signals generated in the control stick are processed in a signal processing unit 12 and by means of a servo unit 13 control a radar antenna 14 in the same direction as the stick deflection in relation to a common reference direction, which in the described application is preferably the longitudinal axis of the airplane, and to an angle that is proportional to the stick deflection. From the foregoing it will be seen that the invention eliminates the disadvantages of known constructions that are pointed out in the introduction, by reason of its freeing the cavity in the stick that would otherwise be occupied by a universal joint or the like, thus providing the possibility for building the signal emitter as well as the spring element into the stick itself. The control device construction according to the invention is thus characterized by great mechanical simplicity and a reliable signal function, even in installations wherein a difficult dynamic environment prevails.
