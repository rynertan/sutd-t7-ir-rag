# A fluidized bed reactor system.

## Abstract
A fluidized bed reactor system comprises a vessel 10 adapted to contain a fluidized bed, a plurality of fluid injector means 24 mounted through the vessel wall 20 for injecting and distributing a fluidizing medium into the lower portion of the vessel, each injector means being made up of an elongated injector having a nozzle end 26 projecting into the vessel. The injector is withdrawably mounted through the vessel wall and has at least one downwardly directed orifice 28 . Shield means 32 are provided which are mounted on the vessel wall above the injector extending along the length of the injector for maintaining an opening in the bed when the injector is withdrawn. The opening is substantially equivalent to the length of the injector. The reactor system further includes fluid supply means 48 in fluid communication with each elongated injector 24 for supplying the fluidizing medium to each nozzle end 26 . When it is required to replace the injector due, for example, to clogging of the orifices or deterioration, the injector is withdrawn from the vessel, replaced or repaired and then inserted into the vessel. The shield means allows for the easy insertion of the injector into the vessel by maintaining an opening in the bed, whether fluidized or non fluidized. The fluidized bed reactor system allows for the replacement or repair of injectors without the necessity for shutting down and or cleaning out the vessel.
