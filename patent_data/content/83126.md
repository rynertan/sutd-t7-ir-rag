# A process of preparing shaped products starting from dispersions containing a coagulable amphoteric high molecular substance.

## Abstract
A process of preparing shaped products starting from dispersions which contain at least one coagulable, amphoteric high molecular substance by passing the dispersion through an extruder into a coagulation bath which may be provided with electrodes whereby the coagulation is effected by a change in pH such that the isoelectric point of the substance is passed and care is taken that the dispersion contains sufficient polyvalent ions to prevent the formation of a barrier during extrusion, followed by coagulation, of the shaped product. The dispersion may also contain a cross linking agent for the high molecular substance. The dispersion fed to the extruder preferably contains collagen, glyoxal and calcium ions. The shaped products are applicable as packaging material, particularly the packaging of sausage mass.
