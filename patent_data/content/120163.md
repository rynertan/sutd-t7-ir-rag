# A.C. power entry module.

## Abstract
An A.C. power entry module 10 for supplying A.C. power via output pins 12 provides A.C. fusing, power on off switching, RFI filtering and selection of voltage. The module can be utilized for both U.S. and European style fusing and a number of different voltage options are available which can be selected merely by changing the position of a circuit board. The module receives a fuse holder 21 which holds a fuse holder board 43 fitted with fuse clamps. The contacts 72,74,76 for engaging the fuses 16,18,19 are mounted such that an operator cannot come into contact with them. European or U.S. style fuses can easily be selected, as alternatives, by inverting the fuse holder board 43.
