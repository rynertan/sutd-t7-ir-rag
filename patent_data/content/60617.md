## Description
FLUOROBENZYL CYCLOPROPANE CARBOXYLATES, THEIR PREPARATION, COMPOSITIONS AND USE AS INSECTICIDES This invention relates to novel cyclopropane derivatives useful as insecticides, to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them and to methods of combatting insect and similar invertebrate pests using them. Certain naturally occurring esters of cyclopropane carboxylic acids have long been known to possess insecticidal properties, but these compounds have been too easily degraded by ultra violet light to be of much use in agriculture. Several groups of synthetic compounds based on cyclopropane carboxylic acids for example those disclosed in British patent specifications nos. 1,243,858 and 1,413,491 have been evaluated in an attempt to discover compounds of sufficient light stability for use as general agricultural insecticides. In particular some chlorobenzyl esters of tetramethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid are described in British Patent Specification No.1178857. but their insecticidal activity towards some important pests of agriculture is not very satisfactory. We have discovered that compounds of this type in which there is at least one fluoro substituent in the benzyl group have improved insecticidal performance. Accordingly the present invention provides fluoro benzyl esters of tetramethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid, and in particular provides compounds of formulaEMI1.1 Wherein n represents an integer from one to four and R represents hydrogen, halo, alkyl of up to four carbon atoms, alkenyl of up to five carbon atoms, benzyl, alkoxy of up to four carbon atoms, alkenyloxy of up to five carbon atoms, alkylthio of up to four carbon atoms, alkane sulphonyl of up to four carbon atoms, amino, acylamino of up to four carbon atoms, alkylamino of up to four carbon atoms, dialkylamino of up to a total of eight carbon atoms,N alkyl acylamino of up to a total of eight carbon atoms, alkoxyalkyl of up to a total of six carbon atoms, aryloxyalkyl of up to a total of nine carbon atoms, alkenyloxyalkyl of up to a total of six carbon atoms, alkylthioalkyl of up to a total of six carbon atoms, alkylaminoalkyl of up to a total of six carbon atoms, or dialkylaminoalkyl of up to a total of ten carbon atoms. Thus R may be, for example, hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, allyl, butenyl, methylbutenyl, benzyl, methoxy, ethoxy, allyloxy, ethylthio, ethanesulphonyl, amino, acetamido, diethylamino,N methylacetamido, methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, propoxymethyl, phenoxymethyl, allyloxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, ethylthiomethyl, or diethylaminomethyl. A first preferred group of compounds is that wherein n is four, especially when R is 4 fluoro, 4 methyl, 4methoxy, 4 methoxymethyl or 4 allyl group. A second preferred group of compounds is that wherein n is one and R represents halo, especially 2 chloro.

Many of the compounds of formula II, particularly those wherein n is four and R is alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy or alkoxyalkyl, or similar groups such as alkylthio, alkylsulphonyl, amino, alkylamino, benzyl, alkylthioalkyl or alkylaminoalkyl, have not previously been described. The compounds of formula II may be prepared by different processes depending upon the nature of the substituents in the benzene ring. Thus for alkyl or alkenyl substituted compounds of formula II where R is alkyl the appropriately substituted alkyl or alkenylfluorobenzene may be carboxylated for example by the use of an organometallic reagent such as alkyl lithium, followed by decomposition of the reaction product with carbon dioxide and subsequent reduction to the alcohol, using an appropriate reducing reagent, for example, lithium aluminium hydride. The alkyl or alkenyl substituted fluorobenzenes used as starting materials in this sequence may be prepared by the alkylation of the appropriate fluorobenzenes using organometallic reagents such as alkyl lithium, and decomposing the reaction products with alkyl or alkenyl halides. Alternatively the fluorobenzenes may be carboxylated first, and the resultant fluorobenzoic acids reduced to the benzyl alcohol which is then alkylated or alkenylated in a protected form for example as the tetrahydropyranyl ether using alkyllithium followed by reaction with an alkyl or alkenyl halide. All of these processes are illustrated in the following scheme. EMI8.1 The compounds of formula II wherein R is alkylthio or alkoxy may be prepared oy displacement of halogen, e.g. fluorine, from an appropriately substituted fluorobenzyl alcohol, or the tetrahydropyranyl ether thereof. The following scheme illustrates the reactions used to prepare a number of compounds of formula II. EMI9.1 Sinilarly the compounds of formula II where R is amino or substituted amino may also be obtained from the corresponding fluorobenzyl alcohol. The following scheme illustrates the reactions involved in preparing some of these compounds.EMI10.1 In an alternative process compounds of formula I where R represents an acylamino group may be obtained by acylation e.g. by reaction with the appropriate acyl chloride of the corresponding compound where R4 is hydrogen. The compounds of formula II wherein R represents an alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl or alkylaminoalkyl group may be obtained by reactions similar to those illustrated in the following Scheme. EMI12.1 The compounds of formula I may be used to combat and control infestations of insect pests and also other invertebrate pests, for example, acarine pests. The insect and acarine pests which may be combatted and controlled by the use of the invention compounds include those pests associated with agriculture which term includes the growing of crops for food and fibre products, horticulture and animal husbandry , forestry, the storage of products of vegetable origin, such as fruit, grain and timber, and also those pests associated with the transmission of diseases of man and animals. In order to apply the compounds to the locus of the pests they are usually formulated into compositions which include in addition to the insecticidally active ingredient or ingredients of formula I suitable inert diluent or carrier materials, and or surface active agents. The compositions may also comprise another pesticidal material, for example another insecticide or acaricide, or a fungicide, or may also comprise a insecticide synergist, such as for example dodecyl imidazole, safroxan, or piperonyl butoxide. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a solid diluent or carrier, for example kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, or talc, or they may be in the form of granules, wherein the active ingredient is absorbed in a porous granular material for example pumice, gypsum or corn cob grits. Granules are particularly useful for combating soil borne insect pests, such as root worms of the genus Diabrotica, cutworms Agrotis spp. and wireworms Agriotis spp. . Preferably, the granules contain from 1 to 2.5 by weight of the active ingredient, which is absorbed onto the granule by, for example, spraying the granules with a solution of the active ingredient in a volatile solvent which is subsequently evaporated from the surface of the granules.Such solutions may contain other ingredients, for example a resin to regulate the rate of release of the active ingredient from the granules, or to help prevent premature disintegration of the granules. Granules may be applied to the soil either in a band between the furrows defining the crop rows, or broadcast, and may if desired be lightly incorporated in the soil, or they may be placed in the furrows themselves at the time of planting the crop.Application of granules at a rate of from 5 to 25 lb acre approximately 5 to 25 Xg ha is usually sufficient to control the pests, and a preferred rate is within the range 8 to 15 lb acre approximately 8 to 15 kg ha based on the active ingredient. Alternatively the compositions may be in the form of liquid preparations to be used as dips or sprays, which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions of the active ingredient in the presence of one or more known wetting agents, dispersing agents or emulsifying agents surface active agents . Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be of the cationic, anionic or non ionic type.Suitable agents of the cationic type include, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Suitable agents of the anionic type include, for example, soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters or sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, or butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates. Suitable agents of the nonionic type include, for example, the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl phenol, nonyl phenol and octyl cresol.Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. The compositions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable solvent, for exanple, a ketonic solvent such as diacetone alcohol, or an aromatic solvent such as trimethylb zene and adding the mixture so obtained to water which may contain one or more known wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents. Other suitable organic solvents are dimethyl formamide, ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and other glycols, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, white oil, methylnaphthalene, xylenes and trichloroethylene, N methyl2 pyrrolidone and tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol THFA . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant such as fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compositions which are to be used in the form of aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient or ingredients, the said concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage, to be capable of dilution with water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogenous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may contain 10 85 by weight of the active ingredient or ingredients. then diluted to form aqueous preparations such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used. For agricultural or horticultural purposes, an aqueous preparation containing between 0.0001 and 0.1 by weight of the active ingredient is particularly useful. In use the compositions are applied to the pests, to the locus of the pests, to the habitat of the pests, or to growing plants liable to infestation by the pests, by any of the known means of applying pesticidal compositions, for example, by dusting or spraying. The compositions of the invention are very toxic to wide varieties of insect and other invertebrate pests, including, for example, the following Aphis fabae aphids Megoura viceae aphids Aedes aegypti mosquitoes Dysdercus fasciatus capsids Musca domestica houseflies Pieris brassicae white butterfly, larvae Plutella maculipennis diamond back month, larvae Phaedon cochleariae mustard beetle Telarius cinnabarinus carmine spider mite Aonidiella spp. scale insects Trialeuroides spp. white flies Blattella germanica cockroaches Spodoptera littoralis cotton leaf worm Chortiocetes terminifera locusts Diabrotica spp. rootworms Agrotis spp. cutworms The compounds of formula I and compositions comprising them have shown themselves to be particularly useful in controlling lepidopteran pests of cotton, for exampleSpodoptera spp. and Heliothis spp. The fumigant properties of the compounds enable them to be used to combat pests which inhabit the soil, for example Diabrotica spp. They are also excellent knock down agents and as such may be used in conjunction with other insecticides to combat public health pests such as flies. They are also very useful in combatting insect and acarine pests which infest domestic animals, such as Lucilia sericata, and ixodid ticks such as Boophilus spp., Ixodes spp., Amblyomma spp., Rhipicephalus spp., and Dermaceutor spp. They are effective in combatting both susceptible and resistant strains of these pests in their adult, larval and intermediate stages oS growth, and may be applied to the infested host animal by topical, oral or parenteral administration. The following Examples illustrate the various aspects of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates the insecticidal properties of compounds of this invention. The activity of the compounds was determined using a variety of insect pests. The compound was used in the form of liquid preparations containing 500, 100, 50 or 25 parts per million p.p.m. by weight of the compound. The preparations were made by dissolving the compound in a mixture of solvents consisting of 4 parts by volume of acetone and 1 part by volume of diacetone alcohol. The solutions were then diluted with water containing 0.01 by weight of a wetting agent sold under the trade name LISSAPOL NX until the liquid preparations contained the required concentration of the compound. Lissapol is aRegistered Trade Mark. The test procedure adopted with regard to each pest was basically the same and comprised supporting a number of the pests on a medium which was usually a host plant or a foodstuff on which the pests feed, and treating either or both the pests and the medium with the preparations. The mortality of the pests was then assessed at periods usually varying from one to three days after the treatment.Details are given in Table II. The results of the tests are given in Table III for each of the compounds at the rate in parts per million given in the second column as a grading of mortality on a scale of 0 9 wherein 0 represents less than 10 mortality 1 from 10 to 19 2 20 to 29 3 30 to 39 4 40 to 49 5 50 to 59 6 60 to 69 7 70 to 79 8 80 to 89 9 90 to100 In Table III the pest organism used is designated by a letter code and the pest species, the support medium or food, and the type and duration of test is given inTable II.
