## Description
This invention relates to an improved process for disrupting cells, and in particular to a process for disrupting cells of a polysaccharide producing microorganism of the genus Pseudomonas. In microbiological processes it is often necessary in the later stages to disrupt the bacterial cells. Especially in the microbial production of polysaccharides for use as viscosifiers in enhanced oil recovery this is a major requirement. Cellular debris and non viable bacteria have to be removed from the polysaccharide containing solution before these solutions can be used in enhanced oil recovery operations. Because it is the presence of these particulate solids in the polysaccharide solution which can present considerable difficulty in field application of the polymer flood when causing plugging of the rock face and injection water filters. In European Patent Application 0078556 in the name of Applicant a process for cell disruption is described which comprises the contacting of an aqueous, cell containing medium with a protease enzyme, wherein the enzymic contact is preceded by contact with a surfactant. Further research efforts on cell disruption has now resulted in the surprising finding that a remarkable improvement especially in the efficiency of the surfactant treatment step is achieved when the cells of microorganisms of the genus Pseudomonas contain one or more RP4 and or RP4 Mu It might be possible that plasmid transposon mutagenesis occurs in the Pseudomonas DNA which means that pieces of DNA from the plasmids integrate in Pseudomonas DNA and in this way activate certain gens which are responsible for rendering the Pseudomonas cells more sensitive to the surfactant. Therefore in this application the description Pseudomonas cells containing one or more RP4 and or RP4 Mu The present process is particularly suitable for disrupting cells of the microorganism The surfactant used in the present process is preferably an anionic surfactant. A preferred one is an alkali metal alkyl sulphate, alkylbenzene sulphonate, sulphated alkanol ethoxylate or a sulphated alkanol, in which the alkyl chain contains at least 8 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable surfactants are sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS , Dobanol 25 3S The present invention further provides a process as hereinbefore described in which after the cells have been contacted with the surfactant they are contacted with an enzyme which is preferably an alkaline protease and which process represents an improvement with regard to the earlier process of that nature as described in the European Patent Application 0078556 as was mentioned before. Suitable alkaline protease are Alcalase , Esperase and Savinase all being from bacterial origin. Incorporation into a microorganism of the genus It is suitable to use process conditions which are the same or similar to those of the process for the production of a polysaccharide as described in European Patent Applicaiton 0040445. Still further the polysaccharide so produced may be used in a process for displacing a fluid through a well and or a permeable subsurface formation communicating with the well, by injecting into the well an aqueous solution which contains the polysaccharide as a viscosifier. The present invention will be further described with reference to the following General description of the Experimental Part and the Examples. Bacteria were grown overnight at 30 C on an orbital incubator at 220 rpm in dYT g l Tryptone, 16 Yeast Extract, 10 NaCl, 5 . Then subcultured into 1 in 20 into fresh medium 50mls in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated for approximately 6 hours. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3,000g x 15 min. and resuspended in fresh dYT. Cultures were incubated at 50 C unless noted for 30 mins, split into 2ml portions and SDS sodium dodecyl sulphate , added to give final percentage shown. Samples were incubated for 30 mins. at room temperature on a rotating incubator. Effect of lysis treatment was measured by absorbance at 600nm compared with untreated controls. Results are expressed as absorbance remaining after treatment. 100 no lysis. Table 1 shows the effect of culture age in case of lysis of the cells of Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11592 containing RP4 plasmids and Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11592 without RP4 plasmids by SDS. All in dYT. The overnight culture was incubated further 22h culture. Table 2 shows the effect of pH change of lysis medium on lysis and the effect of applying or omitting the pretreatment at 50 C for 30 mins. of cells of Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 11592 with and without RP4 plasmids. Table 3 shows the results of an experiment on the lysis of Xanthomonas campestris NCIB 11854 with and without plasmids RP4 and Xanthomonas campestris NCIB 11808 by SDS and Alcalase . The SDS results are for bacteria in dYT and for enzyme Alcalase lysis the bacteria were resuspended in 50mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0. Table 4 shows the results of an experiment on the lysis of
