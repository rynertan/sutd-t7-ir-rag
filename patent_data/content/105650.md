# Process for preparing 9,11 epoxy steroids from 9 alpha substituted 11 hydroxy steroids.

## Abstract
Acyclic amines are used to transform 9α substituted 11β hydroxy 21 acyloxy steroids to the corresponding 9β,11β epoxy 21 acyloxy steroids without removal of the C₁₇ or C₂₁ ester. The acyclic amines are cheaper and easier to prepare than previously disclosed dehydrohalogenating agents which do not produce cleavage of the C₂₁ ester.
