# Poly ester amide capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase derived from p hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,6 dihydroxynaphthalene, carbocyclic dicarboxylic acid, aromatic monomer capable of forming an amide linkage and, optinally, additional aromatic diol.

## Abstract
A melt processable poly ester amide which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase is provided. The poly ester amide of the present invention consists essentially of the re curring units a p oxybenzoyl moiety, b 2,6 dioxynaphthylene moiety, c carbocyclic dicarboxyl moiety, d aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage in the polymer and, op tionally, e p dioxyaryl moiety, in the proportions indicated. Preferably, the aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage is derived from p aminophenol or p phenylenediamine. The resulting poly ester amide exhibits a melting temperature below approximately 400 C, preferably below approximately 350 C. The poly ester amide of the present invention is pref erably formed by a melt polymerisation technique.
