# A tubular positive plate for use in a lead acid storage battery.

## Abstract
A tubular positive electrode for use in a lead acid storage battery includes a grid structure consisting of a top bar 4 , a lug 6 extending upwardly from the top bar, and spines 8 extending downwardly. A plastic grid complement has spaced apart angularly displaceable side portions 28, 30 which register with shaped surfaces of the grid structure when the grid complement snaps around the top bar. Tubes containing active material are forced over the ends of those angularly displaceable side portions. Current flow is forced through the spines and the active material.
