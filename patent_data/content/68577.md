# A method of making socketed pipe fittings of synthetic plastics material by injection moulding, apparatus for carrying out said method, and fitting produced by the method.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus of making socketed pipe fittings of synthetic plastics material by injection mould ing. Prior to starting the injection moulding process a sealing ring 3 is held in somewhat pinched condition with reduced outer diameter at the level of means 2 to be formed on the socket 1 for receiving the sealing ring. During the injection moulding process the sealing ring 3 is held in this condition and is isolated from the moulding cavity. After sufficient, but incomplete cooling of the socket formed, the sealing ring receiving means 2 are partially and temporarily deformed, and the seal ing ring 3 is released to enable it to spring into the partially deformed ring receiving means. Thereafter the ring receiving means 2 reassume their original form, thereby firmly gripping the sealing ring 3 .
