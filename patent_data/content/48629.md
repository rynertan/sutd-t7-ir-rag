# Channel induction furnaces.

## Abstract
A channel induction furnace, particularly for melting aluminium has a pair of U shaped channels 11, 12 extend ing downwardly from the bath 10 . The channels have a radial width, measured outwardly from the axis of the core 13 , which is several times the penetration depth in the molten metal for a current of the energising frequency and the channel section is tapered so that the channel is wider near the core and narrower away from the core. The planes containing the axes of the channels are skewed about an axis of skewing normal to the axis of the core. The large radial width gives a non uniform current distribution resulting in flow patterns across the channel. The tapering provides an unbalanced electromagnetic pressure between the base of the loop and the bath and generates a further flow pattern whilst the skewing produces unidirectional flow through the channel. The combined effect enables high power to be put into the inductor without causing any pinch effect resulting in breaking of the metal path along the channel.
