# Radiation receptor for example for light or heat energy.

## Abstract
A right angle corner reflector 34, 36 reflects different parts of a single incident collimated radiation beam 22, 24, 26, 28 such that a cylindrical region 10 is equally irradiated transversely from four directions 12, 14, 16, 18 . The cylindrical region has an offset position such that ray 40 which strikes the intersection 38 of the corner reflector surfaces is tangent to the side of the cylindrical region. The cylindrical region is spaced from the corner reflector such that one quarter 22 of the radiation incident upon the cylindrical region strikes the region directly, one quarter 24 is first reflected from one of the corner reflector surfaces, one quarter 26 is first reflected from the other corner reflector surface, and one quarter 28 is reflected from first one and then the other corner reflector surface before striking the cylindrical region.
