## Description
Fire alarm systemThe present invention relates to a fire alarm system which is capable of detecting, through a receiver, the operation and the change in output of individual fire detectors among a plurality of fire sensors that are arrayed in parallel along the same lines in the same area.In conventional fire alarm systems, a plurality of fire detectors are connected in parallel across a pair of lines for every area, and the lines are short circuited when a physical phenomenon such as heat or smoke caused by fire has reached a predetermined value to transmit fire signals to the control panel. Therefore, the area where fire has broken out could be indicated only roughly by the control panel. In other words, it is not possible to indicate which fire detector has worked or the change of its output, and it is not possible to indicate the burning condition. Namely it is not possible to suitably control equipment for preventing or expelling the smoke, or to suitably control fire extinguishers.In view of the above mentioned situations, the object of the present invention is to provide a fire alarm system according to which, in case a fire detector has operated, fire signals are transmitted to the control panel like the conventional fire detector, and an address signal which indicates the operated fire detector and the change in output of the detector are transmitted to the control panel, such that the area where fire has broken out, the operated fire detector and the change of its output, are indicated by the control panel.

The out put of the timer circuit 36 is connected to the clear terminal of the counter 29 via OR circuit 37, connected to the reset terminal of the flip flop circuit 31, and is connected to the set terminal of a flip flop circuit 38. The output of the flip flop circuit 38 is connected to the inputs of an AND circuit 39 together with the output of the counter 29, such that the number of pulses in the form of fire detection quantity signals is temporarily stored in a register 40 in a subsequent stage.Further, reference numeral 41 denotes a decoder which converts binary numbers stored in the registers 40 into different values, e.g., which converts binary numbers into decimal numbers, 42 denotes a fire detection quantity indicator circuit which indicates a fire detection quantity depending upon the output of the decoder 41, and which consists of numeral display tubes, 43 denotes a push button switch for restoration, and 44 denotes a reset circuit which consits of resistor R18 to R20, a capacitorC5, and a transistor Tg.The collector of the transistor Tg which produces output is connected to the flip flop circuit 38 and to the reset terminal of the register 33, and is further connected to the clear terminal of the counter 29 and to the reset terminal of the register 40, respectively, viaOR circuits 37 and 45, and another input of the OR circuit 45 is connected to the output of the timer circuit 36.Operation of the circuit will be described below. In Fig. 2, if smoke produced by fire enters into the ion chamber CH2 in the fire detector portion 2 of a fire detector D11 among a multiplicity of fire detectors D11 to Dln connected in parallel across the lines Q1 and Q, the source potential ofFET rises, whereby the comparator 3 operatives at a predetermined value, and the output is sent to the inhibit circuit 4. In this case, other sensors D12 to Dln connected in parallel between the lines Q1 and Q do not operate, the line voltage detector circuit 5 is inoperative, and the inhibit input of the inhibit circuit 4 assumes the low level.Therefore, the output from the fire detector circuit 1 sets the flip flop circuit which works as a latch circuit 6 via inhibit circuit 4, and is further transmitted to the switching circuit 7 and to the delay circuit 8.Responsive to this output, the switching circuit 7 renders the transistor T2 conductive. Therefore, a voltage Vq across the lines Q1 and Q is dropped to a value VF as determined by the Zener diode Z2, as shown in Fig. 4 a , and the thus obtained fire signal is sent to the control panel Re. Accordingly, the voltage drops across the resistor R8 in the fire signal receiver circuit 25 in the receiver Re, whereby the transistor T5 is rendered conductive, the monostable multivibrator M1 in the timer circuit 36 is operated to energize the timer T through OR circuit OR1 and to actuate the relayN so that its operation is maintained by the closure of its contact nl. Consequently, the contact n2 in the alarm indicator circuit 27 is closed to turn the lamp L on.Thus, it is indicated that fire broke out in the area where the detectors D11, D12 to Dln are connected in parallel between the lines Q1 and Q. Further, while the fire signals are being received by the control panel Re, outputs of the latch circuit 6 delayed through the delay circuit 8 drive the non stable multivibrator 11 via inhibit circuit 9 and OR circuit 10, such that pulse outputs are generated. The pulses are counted by the counter 12. When a pulse number 1 is counted, the decoder 13 Operates, whereby the flip flop circuit that works as latch circuit 14 is set, the inhibit input of the inhibit circuit 9 assumes the high level, the non stable multivibrator 11 is stopped through the OR circuit 10, the counter 12 is cleared through the OR circuit 15, and the output is sent to the delay circuit 17. Furthermore, the transistor T3 in the switching circuit 16 operates for a short period of time responsive to a pulse output from the multivibrator 11, and the voltage across the lines Q1 and Q is dropped to VA as shown in Fig. 4 a , such that the address siqnal in the form of a pulse produced by the detector D11 is sent to the receiver Re. In the control panel Re, the transistor T7 in the circuit 26 which receives address signals and fire detection quantity signals, operates responsive to the pulse and is turned on through the contact n3 in the AND circuit 28 where the transistor T8 has already been closed, and a pulse number 1 is counted in the counter 29. In the pulse generator circuit 30, furthermore, the contact n4 in the relay N is switched and the flip flop circuit 31 is set.The value counted by the counter 29 therefore is temporarily stored in the register 33 through AND circuit 32, and 1 is displayed on the numeral display tube of the address indicator circuit 35 through decoder 34, to indicate that the first detector has operated, i.e., to indicate that the fire detector D11 has operated. Thereafter, the timer T which operates after a predetermined period of time has passed produces an output which causes the monostable multivibratorM2 to operate, and the flip flop circuit 31 is reset by the pulse, the counter 29 is cleared through the OR circuit 37, and the flip flop circuit 38 is set. While the address signals are being received by the control panel Re, outputs of the latch circuit 14 delayed by the delay circuit 17 in the fire detector D11 drive the non stable multivibrator 18 so that it will periodically produce pulses having a long pulse width.Responsive to the pulses introduced through the flipflop circuit 19 and the OR circuit 10, the non stable multivibrator 11 and the analog to digital converter 20 are intermittently actuated. The number of pulses generated by the multivibrator 11, i.e., the value counted by the counter 12, and the fire detection quantity of the fire detector portion 2, i.e., the output of the analog to digital converter 20, are compared in the digital coincidence circuit 21 which produces an output when the analog quantity produced by the fire detector portion 2 is in agreement with the value counted by the counter 12. This output resets the flip flop circuit 19 through OR circuit 22, stops the non stable multivibrator 11 through OR circuit 10, and clears the counter 12 through OR circuit 15.Therefore, the non stable multivibrator 11 produces pulses of a number corresponding to the fire detection quantity of the fire detection portion. The flip flop circuit 19 is set responsive to pulses generated successively from the non stable multivibrator 18, to actuate the nonstable multivibrator 11 and the analog to digital converter 20. Being controlled by the digital coincidence circuit 21, therefore, the pulses are continuously produced by the nonstable multivibrator 11 in a number corresponding to the fire detection quantity of that time. Responsive to the thus produced pulses, the transistor T3 in the switching circuit 16 operates for short periods of time, such that the voltage across the lines Q1 and Q is dropped to VA twice and then thrice as shown in Fig. 4 a .Thus, fire detection quantity signals are sent to the receiver to indicate that the output of the fire detection portion 2 is increasing, for example, to 2 volts and then 3 volts. In the control panel Re, the transistor T7 in the circuit 26 which receives address signals and fire detection quantity signals, operates responsive to the pulses, whereby the transistor T8 in the AND circuit 28 is intermittently rendered conductive twice, the timer circuit 36 is energized, the counter 29 counts the pulse number 2 , the counted value is temporarily stored in the register 40 through AND circuit 39, and 2 is displayed on the numeral display tube of the detection quantity indicator circuit 42 via decoder 41, to indicate that the output of 2 volts is produced by the fire detection portion 2 in the fire detector D11.The monostable multivibrator M2 is then operated by the output of the timer T which operates after a predetermined time has passed, the counter 29 is cleared through OR circuit 37, and the register 40 is reset through OR circuit 45. The fire detection quantity signals are then received by the receiver circuit 26, and 3 is displayed in the detection quantity indicator circuit 42, to indicate that the output produced by the fire detector D11 has risen to 3 volts. The above operation is performed repetitively, and the fire detection quantity produced by the detector D11 is displayed on the control panel Re with the lapse of time.As for other detectors D12 to Dln connected in parallel across the lines Q1 and Q, the transistor T1 in their circuit 5 for detecting line voltage remains non conductive, the inhibit input of the inhibit circuit 4 assumes the high level, and no output is transmitted from the fire detector circuit 1. Namely the detectors D12 to Dln remain in the inoperative condition.When the fire detector D12 has operated instead of the fire detector Dll, the non stable multivibrator 11 of the detector is stopped by the output of the decoder 12 under the condition in which two pulses are sent. Therefore, two pulses are sent through the switching circuit 16 as shown in Fig.4 b . When the fire detector Dln has operated, n pulses are sent as shown in Fig. 4 c . In the control panel Re, therefore, the pulses are counted by the counter 29, and the address indicator circuit 35 indicates that the second detector or the n th detector has operated. When a fire detectorDnl of other area has operated, a fire signal receiver circuit 25 which is not shown operates to indicate the area where fire has broken out, and the pulse number 1 produced by the detector as an address signal is detected by the circuit which receives address signals and fire detection quantity signals, whereby it is indicated that the first detector has operated. Moreover, the output of the detector is indicated relying upon the fire detection quantity signals that are introduced subsequently.When a button switch 43 for restoring the control panel Re is depressed for a short period of time, the reset circuit 23 in the detector and the reset circuit 44 in the control panel Re operate i.e., the detector and the control panel are restored to normal condition. Although ion chambers are employed as the fire detector portion 2 in the above mentioned embodiment, it is of course allowable to employ a fire detector portion of the photoelectric type which detects the light scattered by the smoke or of the thermal type such as thermistors. The invention is constructed and operates as mentioned above.Namely, the invention provides a fire alarm system which is capable of discriminating the operation of a fire detector in an area where a plurality of fire detectors are connected in parallel across the same lines, and which is also capable of detecting the change in the output produced by the detector as a result of the fire.4.
