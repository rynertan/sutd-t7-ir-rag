## Description
POLYPEPTIDE, PROCESS FOR PREPARING IT, MICROORGANISM AND PHARMACEUTICAL USE The invention relates to a novel polypeptide having antitumor activities, and a process for preparing said polypeptide. Specifically, the invention relates to a process for preparing a novel polypeptide having antitumor or tumor necrosis activities by use of the recombinant DNA technique or by purification from the culture of activated human macrophage or human macrophage like cells, and also to a novel polypeptide obtained by the process and antitumor or tumor necrosis preparations containing said polypeptide. Increasing knowledge has been accumulated about the production of trace amounts of biologically important substances, such as interferons IFN , interleukine 2 IL2 , lymphotoxin LT and tumor necrosis factor TNF , from such various components in body fluids, particularly blood, as leukocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages. As a result, many researchers have been making attempts at producing these useful substances either by cultivating cell lines or fused cells capable of producing such substances or by culturing microorganisms or animal cells constructed by the recombinant DNA technology. The existence of a substance having tumor killing activity has been reported in association with the results of in vitro and jii vivo tests. Carswell et al. first reported in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 1X, 3666 3670 1975 the discovery of this substance in the serum of endotoxin injected mice, rats and rabbits, previously sensitized with Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacillus Calmelte Gurin BCG or other immunostimulatory agents.This activity of the serum was named tumor necrosis factor hereunder referred to as TNF . Today, the production ofTNF is considered to derive from activated macrophages in the organism Ruff, M. R. Gifford, G. E. in Lymphokine reports Pick, E., ed. Vol. 2, pp. 235 272, AcademicPress, New York, 1981 , and as a matter of fact, the TNF activity can be obtained in the culture supernatant of BCGor endotoxin treated monocytic cells. TNF causes hemorrhagic necrosis of various tumors with no apparent effect on the host and displays cytocidal and cytostatic activities against several transformed cells those which have differentiated to tumors without affecting normal cells. Because of these features, TNF holds great promise as antitumor agents. Various attempts have been made to obtain human derived substances having TNF activity, and they include efforts to obtain native human TNF by cultivation of human macrophage like cells and those to obtain synthetic humanTNF by culturing microorganisms created by the recombinantDNA technology. As for the recovery of natural human TNF,Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No.30688 1985 discloses a method depending on the treatment of human macrophage like cell lines, HL 60, THP 1 or Mono 1 207 with a variety of inducers. nica, D. et al. Nature, li, 724 729, 1984 and Aggarwal, B. B. et al. J. Biol.Chem., ZÇQ, 2345 2354, 1985 of Genentech, Inc.,California, U.S.A. reported a method of inducing and purifying human TNF from HL 60 cells. Wang, A. M. et al. Science, 228, 149 154, 1985 of Cetus Corp., California,U.S.A. reported another method for inducing and purifying human TNF from HL 60 cells. The method of purifying humanTNF and its physicochemical properties are best described by the above mentioned scientists of Genentch, Inc. According to their reports, native human TNF could be obtained from culture supernatants of the HL 60 promyelocytic leukemia cell induced by 4ss phorbal 12ss myristate 13a acetate PMA after subjecting them to a purification scheme consisting of controlled pore glass beads, DEAE cellulose 53 chromatography, Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography and preparative reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified human TNF had a molecular weight MW of 17,000 as estimated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hereunder SDS PAGE andMW of 45,000 1 6,000 as deduced from high pressure gel permeation chromatography using a TSK G2000 5W column.Based on these data, the authors suggested that human TNF would occur naturally as a dimeric or trimeric polypeptide, and that the molecular weights of 34,000 140,000 previously reported by Matthews, N. Immunology, Ai, 135 142, 1981 and Nissen Meyers, J. Bammerstrom, J. Infect.Immun., lE, 67 73, 1982 may have resulted from differences caused by oligomerization under natural conditions.By chromatofocusing on a Mono P column, the purified humanTNF was found to have an isoelectric point pI of 5.2 5.4. Furthermore, as a result of amino acid sequence analysis, the purified human TNF was found to be a polypeptide having an N terminus beginning with Val Arg Ser Ser. According to the analysis of cDNA clone made from mRNA that was prepared from PMA induced HL 60 cells, the natural mature human TNF monomer was assumed to be a polypeptide having a calculated molecular weight of 17,356 that was composed of 157 amino acids obtained by processing deleting the first N terminal 76 amino acid sequence from a precursor polypeptide consisting of 233 amino acids seeFig. 1 .In view of the results of SDS PAGE and N terminal amino acid sequence of the purified human TNF from HL 60 cells, the natural human TNF does not occur in a heterogeneous state as lymphotoxin or Y interferon both of which occur naturally as polypeptides of various sizes as a consequence of N terminal and C terminal proteolysis, respectively but occurs as a homogeneous monomer. In other words, mature human TNF monomer is a polypeptide that is formed as part of its precursor see Fig. 1 ... Ala GlnAla Val Arg Ser Ser Ser Arg Thr .., and which has been cleaved at the position indicated by the vertical arrow no significant post translational processing such as proteolysis or glycosidation will occur in the HL 60 cell line. Another prior art reference that describes the amino acid sequence of human TNF is Shirai, T., et al., Nature, l12. 803 806, 1985 which reports the production of humanTNF like polypeptide with 155 amino acids by the recombinant DNA technology. Shirai et al. analyzed the DNA sequence of cDNA clone of human TNF but they did not predict the whole amino acid sequence of mature human TNF by determining theN terminal amino acid sequence of naturally occurring humanTNF polypeptide as was done by the scientist group ofGenentech, Inc. Instead, they used as a reference the Nterminal amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF disclosed inUnexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No.19719 1985, and simply estimated that human TNF would be a polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 17,099 that consisted of 155 amino acids with a sequence beginning with Ser Ser Ser Arg Thr Pro. Shirai et al. presumed that the purified human TNF they produced from EL coli would have almost the same or an identical structure to the natural human TNF.Shirai et al. obtained the purified polypeptide from the supernatant cell lysate of a culture of recombinantDNA Es coli by a purification scheme consisting of chromatography on DEAE Sepharose CL 6B column, heating at 60 0C for 30 minutes, chromatography on another DEAE Sepharose CL 6B column, and column chromatography on Sephacryl 8 200. The polypeptide had molecular weights of 45,000 as determined from chromatography on Sephacryl S 200 column, and 17,000 as determined by SDS PAGE. Isoelectric focusing showed that the polypeptide s isoelectric point was 6.0. The inventors succeeded in purifying a novel polypeptide having TNF activities different from the above polypeptide from a culture solution of activated macrophagelike cell U 937 ATCC deposit No. CRL1593 . The polypeptide is different from the polypeptide already reported in the above literatures in terms of not only amino acid sequence but also physical and chemical properties although the amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus is the same . The new polypeptide was expected to be a useful antitumor agent different from conventional agents. Furthermore, the inventors made earnest study so as to prepare a large amount of said novel polypeptide refer to 15N4TNF hereunder in good efficiencies and found that an coli transformed by a plasmid constructed as follows is cultivated to produce SN4TNF. Said plasmid is constructed by joining a promoter derived from an EL coli gene, or a X phage or a T4 phage promoter region, and the ribosome binding or SD sequence with a DNA sequence coding for ssN4TNF at a site upstream of the DNA sequence, also joining a transcription terminator coding for the termination of transcription just downstream of said tN4TNF gene interrupted by a translation termination codon, and inserting the joined DNA sequence into a plasmid derived form pBR322, from which the rop repressor of primer region coding for the replication of the plasmid may be deleted, if desired.

The TNF producing cell used in the present invention was macrophage like cell U 937 American Type CultureCollection, CRL 1593 derived from human histiocytic lymphoma. A substance having TNF activity was induced by adding the usual 4ss phorbol 12B myristte 13a acetate PMA , plus retinoic acid and insulin to a culture broth of U 937. The ability of U 937 to produce TNF is described inCamerson, D. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc., LA, 45 52, 1983.The culture supernatant was concentrated about 100 fold in a hollow fibers. The concentrate was subjected to a purification scheme consisting of chromatography on a dye adsorption affinity carrier combined in a proper order with two or more of column chromatography on anion exchange carrier e.g.DEAE Sepharose , chromatofocusing, column chromatography on hydrophobic carrier e.g. phenyl Sepharose and gel permeation chromatography on, e.g. Sephacryl S 200 . For the records obtained in respective purification steps, see Figs.2 to 6. In analyses by SDS PAGE and silver staining, the purified product exhibited two protein bands corresponding to molecular weights of about 19,000 and 17,000, and the protein corresponding to MW of about 17,000 was the novel polypeptide having TNF activity in accordance with the present invention see Fig. 7 . By gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl 8 200, the polypeptide in native form was found to have a molecular weight of 47,000 i 5,000, and this taken with the results of SDS PAGE suggests that the polypeptide may occur naturally as an oligomer. Chromatofocusing with a purified sample showed that the native polypeptide of the present invention was between 5.2 and 5.3.The sequence of the first 23 N terminal amino acid residues in the predominant polypeptide having a molecular weight of about 17,000 as determined by SDS PAGE was SerArg Thr Pro Ser Asp Lys Pro Val Ala His Val Val Ala Asn ProGln Ala Glu Gly Gln Leu Gln. This N terminal amino acid sequence is the same as that starting at the fifth amino acid from the N terminus of the polypeptide reported inPennica, D. et al. ibid and Wang, A. M. et al. ibid, as consisting of 157 amino acids, and is also the same as the sequence starting at the third amino acid from the N terminus of the polypeptide reported in Shirai, T. et al.ibid, as consisting of 155 amino acids in cDNA clone seeFig. 1 . However, the polypeptide discovered in the present invention is an entirely new type of substance produced by activated macrophage like cells that could not be anticipated from the references listed above and any of the other prior art references. This substance has a TNF activity comparable to or higher than that of the known polypeptide consisting of 157 or 155 amino acids maximum cytocidal activity against the L 929 cell to be defined hereinafter 3.3 x 107 U mg protein, see Table 2 below , as well as high heat and pH stabilities.If it is correct to assume that the polypeptide of the present invention was produced by some proteolytic action exerted in the organism on the precursor protein of the type shown in Fig. 1, the polypeptide of the invention composed of 153 amino acids is potentially more stable than the polypeptide composed of 157 or 155 amino acids. The polypeptide of the present invention has the properties summarized in Table 1 below. In the Examples that follow of present invention, U 937 histiocytic lymphoma cell line was used as the macrophage like cell, but it should be understood that any other macrophage like cells such as HL 60, THP 1 and Mono 1 207 may also be used.

A transformant for producing novel polypeptide ssN4TNF having antitumor activities may be obtained by transforming coli with a plasmid variously improved as described below from plasmid pBR322 PL T4 hTNF ss coli C600 strain into which the plasmid was integrated was deposited by Deposit No. DSM 3175 to the Culture Collection of the DeutscheSammlung von Mikroorgamismen to which was integrated a gene coding for a polypeptide refer to Fig. 1 abbreviated asTNF hereinafter consisting of 157 amino acids and havingTNF activities. First, plasmid pPLT4 N4TNF in which a gene coding forTNF is replaced by a gene coding for N4TNF is constructed by replacing an upstream region of a gene coding for TNF in plasmid pBR322 PL T4 hTNF by a chemically synthesized DNA linker refer to Fig. 8 . The plasmid pBR322 PL T4 hTNF contains a DNA fragment constructed so as to express the TNF gene under the control of PL promoter derived from A phage or a promoter derived from T4 phage. Also, the ribosome binding sequence or Shine Dalgarno sequence or SD sequence used is derived from T4 phage. EL coli transformed by the plasmid also produces tN4TNF, but the plasmid is further improved as follows so as to produce tN4TNF in much better efficiencies.In the invention, a cDNA fragment from mRNA which is produced from an activated human macrophage like cell is used as a AN4TNF gene, but said gene should not be limited to the cDNA fragment and a chemically synthesizedDNA corresponding to the amino acid sequence of tN4TNF may also be used. The inventors disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 253423 84 that if an alien polypeptide is produced in coli, said alien polypeptide may be produced in high yields by joining a transcription terminator just downstream a translation termination codon in a gene coding for said polypeptide. On the basis of the findings, the inventors inserted a terminator derived from an EL coli gene just downstream the translation termination codon of the AN4TNF gene. This terminator was derived from plasmid pIN5T8, and inserted as shown in Fig. 9 a and Fig. 9 b. This plasmid is one in which TrpA terminator of EL coli is inserted downstream of a translation termination codon of an exogenous gene in the plasmid pIN5GIF54, and the construction thereof is disclosed by Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 24187 85.That is, a cutting site with restriction endonuclease SalI is introduced downstream the DN4TNF gene in plasmid pPLT4N4TNF according to the in vitro mutation method byMorinaga, Y. et al. Biotechnology X, 636 639, 1984SalI in Fig. 9 , and a DNA fragment SalI fragment containing trpA terminator of pIN5T8 is inserted at SalI cutting site so as to construct pPLT4DN4TNFST8 in which a transcription terminator is joined at a site just downstream the translation termination codon of the AN4TNF gene. In the process an ampicillin resistant marker Apt on plasmid DN4TNF is changed to a tetracycline resistant marker Tcr .The DN4TNF productivity of EL coli transformed by this plasmid is much greater than that of EL coli transformed by pPLT4 N4TNF. Also, host E. coli to be transformed by the N4TNF expression plasmid using the PLT4 promoter should be E. coli transformed beforehand by a plasmid e.g., pCI857 which is capable of expressing a temperature sensitive repressor gene e.g., CI857 of A phage and also compatible with other plasmids such as pBR322, or bacteria lysogenic to X phage and having the above repressor gene. The reason that the host capable of expressing the temperature sensitive repressor gene or A phage is used is because the PL promoter is operated stably and efficiently to produce the desired polypeptide in high yields.Plasmid pCI857 which bears temperature sensitive repressor gene CI857 of X phage is described in Gene 22, 103 11.3, 1983 Remand, E., Tsao, H. Fiers, W. , and the plasmid has a kanamycin resistant gene integrated and is compatible with a plasmid derived from pBR322. E. coliWA802 and W3110 transformed by this plasmid are represented by WA802 Cl and WA3110 Cl, respectively. Plasmid pPLT4DN4TNFST8 obtained above is considered to express to AN 4TNF gene under the control of PL promoter derived from X phage and a promoter derived from T4 phage.The inventors further carried out elimination of the rop region repressor of primer which has activities inhibiting the synthesis of primer RNA essential to replication of plasmid DNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA vol. 79, pp 6313 6317, 1982 which is considered to control modification of promoter region and the number of copies of plasmid to construct a plasmid for expression SN4TNF in high yields refer to Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 . Modification of expression system under the control both of PL promoter and T4 promoter to that of T4 promoter alone Fig. 10 is carried out in order to generalize the host E. coli and to produce the desired polypeptide constitutively. If PL promoter is used, CI gene which is a repressor of phage should necessarily be present in the host cell. Therefore, restrictions on the host E. coli are reduced by use of T4 promoter alone. Fig. 10 shows plasmid pT4DN4TNFST8 rop constructed from plasmid pPLT4DN4TNF Sall see Fig. 9 a by modification of the promoter region PL T4 T4 , elimination of the rop region and modification of the chemical resistant marker Apr b Tcr , and addition of TrpA terminator.Modification of the promoter region and the drug resistant marker and elimination of the rop region are carried out by eliminating an EcoRI Sall fragment containing the PL promoter region from pPlT4TNF Sall and inserting aSall AhaIII fragment containing a tetracycline resistant gene Tcr of plasmid pBR322 Ball which was derived from pBR322 and constructed by eliminating 622 base pairs betweenBalI and PvuII cutting sites from pBR322. Also, addition of the transcription terminator is carried out by inserting aSalI fragment containing the TrpA terminator of the abovementioned plasmid pIN5T8 into the SalI cutting site at the terminal region of the tN4TNF gene in pPLT4DN4TNF Sall. SL coli transformed by plasmid pT4 AN4 TNFST8 rop thus obtained can produce AN4TNF in high yields.The ribosome binding sequence between the promoter region and the tN4TNF gene in the above plasmids pPLT4DN4TNFST8 and pPLT4DN4TNFST8rop has the SD sequence derived from T4 phage. The promoter region and the SD sequence should not be limited to the above mentioned ones, and any one suitable for the host used may be used. For example, if E. coli is used for the host, a promoter region for the outer cell membrane lipoprotein gene lpp of coli may be used for the promoter region, and chemically synthesized oligonucleotide DNA fragment which is designed so as to be complementary with 3 terminus of 16S ribosome RNA of EL ÇQli may be used for the SD sequence. Fig. 11 shows a process for constructing plasmid pPLT4DN4TNFST8rop which expresses the AN4TNF gene under the control of lpp promoter and the synthesized SD sequence by use of plasmid pIN5T8 already constructed as described above and an EcoRI AvaI linker.In this pIN5T8 plasmid, human y interferon gene GIF is inserted into the plasmid so as to express GIF under the control of lpp promoter and chemically synthesizedSD sequence. First, a small fragment ClaI AvaI containing a region at the 5 terminal region of tN4TNF in pPLT4tN4TNF SalI is eliminated, and a chemically synthesized EcoRI AvaI linker,EMI13.1 is joined. Then EcoRI Sall fragment containing the 1pp promoter, chemically synthesized SD sequence and a TCr gene of pIN5DN4TNFST is introduced so as to construct plasmid pIN5DN4TNFST in which DEN4TNF gene is joined downstream of the lpp promoter and the chemically synthesized SD sequence and a transcription terminator is joined just downstream of the translation termination codon of the tN4TNF gene.AN4TNF may be produced by use of the plasmid, a small fragment PvuII BalI is eliminated from this plasmid to construct plasmid pINSAN4TNFST8 rop . E. coli transformed by the plasmid produces AN4 TNF almost equivalent to that produced by E. coli transformed by plasmids pPLT4tN4TNFST8 and pT4DN4TNFST8rop . Host EL coli W3110, W3110 CI, WA802 or WA802 CI transformed by various types of plasmids described above are cultured in an appropriate medium by shaking culture or aeration agitation culture. The bacterial cells obtained are disrupted by the freeze thawing method by use of lysozyme or by means of a French press, a homogenizer, etc.The extract from the disrupted bacterial cells is subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis abbreviated asSDS PAGE hereinafter and measurements of TNF activities to check the amount of sN4TNF produced see Table 3 and Table 4 . The TNF activities are determined according to a method described in Lymphokines, vol. 2, 235, Academic Press 1981 as will be described later. Also, ssN4TNF contained in the extract from the culture solution of the transformed EX coli strain is purified according to the method described in the present specification, and is then subjected to amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition of ssN4TNF thus obtained by the process of the invention is consistent with the composition expected see Table 6 .Thus, the process of this invention was confirmed to be useful for producing polypeptides from the culture solution described above. The polypeptide purified in the invention is different from the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids shown in Fig. 1 which has already been reported in terms of physical and chemical properties and TNF activities specific activities . The 15 amino acid polypeptides may be obtained by culturing EL M transformed by plasmid pBR322 PL T4 hTNF shown in Fig. 8 followed by purification of the culture bacteria according to a method similar to that described above. The polypeptide produced by this invention has TNF activities higher than those of the polypeptide shown in Fig. 1. The present invention also provides a novel method for TNF purification making use of the ability of the polypeptide described above to be adsorbed on a dye adsorption affinity carrier. Mouse and rabbit TNFs have been known to lack the ability to be adsorbed on Cibachrone Blue 3GA dye adsorption affinity carrier Tamura Ishida, Jpn.J. Cancer Chemother., 11, 1369 1378, 1984 . Since TNF generally has no specificity to species, it may well be predicted that human TNF also lacks the ability to be adsorbed on Cibachrone Blue 3GA dye adsorption affinity carrier. Unexpectedly, however, the present inventors have found that the polypeptide of the present invention havingTNF activity could be adsorbed on this particular carrier and be subsequently eluted by increased salt concentrations or pHs. This fact indicates the possibility of using chromatography on a dye adsorption affinity carrier for the purpose of purifying a polypeptide with TNF activity, and as a matter of fact, this technique proved very effective in purifying the polypeptide of the present invention. No case has been reported of using a dye adsorption affinity carrier in purification of a polypeptide having human TNF activity.Another advantage of performing chromatography on this carrier is that the heat treatment step that may involve the denaturation of the desired polypeptide Shirai et al., ibid, and unexamined Published Japanese Patent ApplicationNo. 19719 1985 . The method of purification in accordance with the present invention may also be used in obtaining a purified substance with TNF activity from a culture of a transformant capable of producing TNF activity substance created by the recombinant DNA technology. In the Examples shown later in this specification,Matrex Blue A Amicon was used as a dye adsorption affinity carrier, but Matrex Red A Amicon and Blue Trisacryl LKB may also be used. As described above, the polypeptide of the present invention can be obtained by purifying a culture supernatant of macrophage like cells. It may also be obtained as described above by culturing microorganism or animal cells that have been transformed by a plasmid or phage vector incorporating DNA coding for this peptide which may be either cDNA prepared from mRNA produced by said macrophagelike cells or a chemically synthesized DNA in such a manner that it can be expressed under the control of a suitable promoter.The polypeptide prepared by the recombinant DNA technology peptide with TNF activity composed of 153 amino AN4 acids AN4TNF is indistinguishable from the polypeptide isolated from the culture of U 937 in terms of molecular weight as estimated for monomeric form by SDS PAGE, isoelectric point as determined by chromatofocusing, in vitro antitumor activity, heat stability, HPLC analysis, reactivity with TNF antibody, affinity for various carriers used in chromatographic purification techniques, pH stability,NH2 terminal amino acid sequence, etc. Said AN4TNF is comparable to or higher than the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids Pennica, D. et al., ibid and Wang, A. M. et al., ibid in terms of in vitro antitumor activity, as well as heat and pH stability. The two TNFs also differ with respect to other properties. The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by reference to working examples.Example1 1. Induction and production of TNF active substance from U 937 Human macrophage like cells 0 937 were cultured in a roller bottle Falcon at 37 C for 2 days using 500 ml of anRPMI 1640 medium GIBCO containing 0.228 sodium hydrogencarbonate NaHCO3 , 60 vg ml of Kanamycin, 0.03 glutamine, 5 of fetal bovine serum GIBCO and 5 of horse serum GIBCO after subjecting said medium to an initial pH of 7.2 7.5 by CO2 charge. Thereafter, the culture was centrifugally washed with RPMI 1640 containing 0.22 NaHCO3, 60 g ml of kanamycin and 0.03 glutamine.About 3 x 109 U 937 cells were suspended in 2.7 liters of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.22 NaHC03 and 0.03 glutamine. An 8 liter spinner flask Bellco was used as an incubator for induction and production of the desired substance having TNF activity. To the suspension of U 937 cells, 300 ml of anRPMI 1640 medium containing 320 nM of PMA, 500 nM of retinoic acid and 300 units of bovine insulin all of them were products of Sigma , as well as 0.22 NaHC03 and 0.03 glutamine was added so that the final concentrations ofU 937 cells, PMA, retinoic acid and bovine insulin were respectively about 1 x 106 ml, 32 nM, 50 nM and 100 U l,OOO ml. After incubation at 370C for 24 hours in the dark at 120 rpm, the culture was centrifuged to provide a supernatant in preparation for the measurement of TNF activity.2. Measurement of TNF activity TNF activity was determined by measuring the in vitro tumor cell killing activity in accordance with the following method which was a modification of the method described byRuff, M. R. and Gifford, G. E. 1981 in Lymphokine Reports Pick, E., ed Vol. 2, pp. 235 272, Academic Press,New York. One tenth of a milliliter of cell suspension inEagle s MEM plus 10 fetal bovine serum, 0.1 NaHCO3 and 0.03 glutamine 6 x 105 L 929 cells in log growth stage per ml which were deposited at ATCC as CCLI and which were subspecies of mouse L cells was added to each of the 96 wells in a flat bottom tissue culture microplate Nunc for 0.1 ml of the supernatant sample that had been serially diluted in the same Eagle s MEM. To each well, ActinomycinD Makor Chemicals had been added to a final concentration of 1 pg ml. The microplate was incubated at 370C for ca. 18 hours in air containing 5 CO2. After incubation, the supernatant was discarded and 0.1 ml of a 0.5 aqueousCrystal Violet solution containing 20 methanol, so as to stain adherent L 929 cells for 15 minutes at room temperature. The stained microplate was thoroughly washed with water.After drying, 0.1 ml of 33 aqueous acetic acid solution was added to extract the dye from the stained cell lysate. The absorbance of the extract at 577 nm was measured with Titertek Multiskan Spectrophotometer. The reciprocal of the dilution for the sample having an absorption corresponding to 50 of the value for the control was used as the TNF activity of the sample and indicated in units ml U ml . At least four measurements were made for each sample and their average was taken.3. purification of substance having TNF activity After concentrating the culture supernatant obtained in Example 1 1 through a hollow fiber HIP 10 20 Amicon , the substance having TNF activity present in the supernatant this substance is hereunder simply referred to as TNF was purified by the following scheme consisting, in sequence, of column chromatography on DEAE Sepharose, chromatofocusing, column chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose and chromatography on dye adsorption affinity carrier. It should however be noted that this is not the only order of the purifying steps that can be used in the present invention.a DEAE Sepharose column chromatoaraphy see Fig. 2 Twenty five liters of the culture supernatant of U937 cells obtained in Example 1 1 was subjected to cyclic concentration to 130 ml and buffer replacement by an ultrafiltration unit DC 3 Amicon using a hollow fiber HIP 10 20. The volume of the final concentrate was 250 ml. The concentrate was loaded onto an anion exchanger,DEAE Sepharose CL 6B Pharmacia, 2.5 cit6 x 16 cm that had been thoroughly equilibrated with 10 mM tris HCl buffer pR 7.4 . After thoroughly washing the column with the same buffer, TNF was eluted with aqueous sodium chloride having a linear concentration gradient of O 0.2 M in the same buffer. Elution patterns of protein and TNF activity are shown in Fig. 2. A single peak of TNF activity was observed in the neighborhood of 0.08 M NaCl.b Chromatofocusina Fig. 3 Eighty ml of the active fraction was dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mM imidazole BC1 buffer pH 7.0 and loaded onto chromatofocusing carrier column PBE 94 Pharmacia, 1.0 x v x 40 cm that had been thoroughly equilibrated with 25 mM imidazole HC1 pH 7.0 . Following adjustment to pH of 4.0 with HC1, TNF was eluted with pH gradient formed by causing a 10 fold diluted polybuffer 74 Pharmacia to flow through the column. The resulting elution patterns are shown in Fig. 3. The TNF activity was eluted as a single peak at pHs in the neighborhood of 5.5 0.3.Since chromatofocusing performed after the purification effected by chromatography on dye adsorption affinity carrier in subsequent step d resulted in elution at pHs of 5.2 5.3, the polypeptide of the present invention was found to have an isoelectric point of 5.2 5.3.c Phenvl SeDharose column chromatograrhv see Fi. 4 Fifty ml of the active fraction was mixed with ammonium sulfate to give a saturated concentration of 20 .The mixture was loaded onto a hydrophobic carrier, PhenylSepharose CL 4B column Pharmacia, 1.0 cmd x 10 cm that had been thoroughly equilibrated with 10 mM tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 plus 208 saturated ammonium sulfate. The adsorbed TNF was eluted by simultaneous density gradients of 20 saturation to 0 of ammonium sulfate and 0 to 50 of ethylene glycol in the same buffer. As shown in Fig. 4, the peak having TNF activity was divided into two fractions.The relative values of TNF activities in the two fractions varied with the amount of protein loaded onto the column, and when each fraction was subjected to another run of chromatography, the TNF activity was again divided into two fractions. Column chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose, SDSPAGE analysis of the two fractions, and amino acid analysis to be described later suggested that these results were not due to the presence of two different types of TNF but probably due to the variance in the interaction between TNF and carrier resin resulting from the difference in the state of TNF molecule at the time of addition of ammonium sulfate.d Chromatoaraphy on dve adsorption affinity carrier see Fig. 5 Matrex Blue A Amicon, 1.0 cm x 7 cm was used as the dye adsorption affinity carrier. Of the two fractions having TNF activity that were obtained in c , the fraction having higher TNF activity hereunder referred to asFraction 1 weighing 75 ml was thoroughly dialyzed against 10 mM tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 and loaded onto the MatrexBlue A column equilibrated with the same buffer, followed byTNF elution with aqueous NaCI having a linear concentration gradient of O 1.2 M in the same buffer. As a result, theTNF activity pattern shown in Fig. 5 was obtained. The same elution pattern was obtained for the fraction having lowerTNF activity hereunder Fraction 2 . These results show the effectiveness of the dye adsorption affinity carrier in TNF purification. The TNF activity, amount of protein and other analytical data obtained in each of the purification steps a to d are summarized in Table 2. The amount of protein was determined by the method of Bradford, M. M. Anal.Biochem. 1X, 248 254, 1976 using coupling with Coomassie brilliant blue G 250.

Measurement of molecular weight see Fig. 6 Five ml of the active fraction obtained in 3 d was loaded onto a gel permeation carrier, Sephacryl S 200 Pharmacia, 2.5 cm6 x 100 cm and the molecular weight of naturally occurring TNF was estimated by comparison with standard proteins. More specifically, the active fraction was loaded onto the Sephacryl S 200 column that had been thoroughly equilibrated with 10 mM tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 and 0.5 M NaC1. The resulting elution pattern for the active pattern is shown in Fig. 6.On the basis of comparison with standard proteins, i.e., bovine serum albumin BSA,MW 67 K , ovalbumin OA, MW 45 K , chymotripsinogen A CHY,MW 25 K and ribonuclease RIB, MW 13.7 K , the polypeptide of the present invention was calculated to have a molecular weight of 47,000 5,000 in native form. As will be described later in this specification, the monomeric form of TNF was found to have a molecular weight of about 17 K partly 19 K by SDS PAGE analysis, so it was assumed that the native form of the polypeptide of the present invention had a subunit structure. Furthermore, two samples, one treated with a reducing agent, 2 mercaptoethanol and the other untreated, exhibited an approximately 17 K protein band by SDS PAGE, and a slice of this band exhibited TNF activity.In view of these two facts, the native form of the polypeptide of the present invention was assumed to be a homo oligomer having no S S crosslink in the subunit structure. The same elution pattern as shown in Fig. 6 was obtained for Fraction 2 after purification with Matrex BlueA. Part of each of Fractions 1 and 2 obtained in 3 d was subjected to SDS PAGE using 138 polyacrylamide gel. Two protein bands were obtained at molecular weights of about 17,000 and about 19,000 see Fig. 7 . It was assumed that the amount of protein corresponding to Mr of ca. 17,000 on the gel in Fig. 7 was about 3 5 times as great as that of protein corresponding to Mr of ca.19,000. The polypeptide of the present invention is the one which corresponds to the molecular weight of ca. 17,000, and from the gel band in Fig. 7, the molecular weight of this protein was calculated to be 17,000 1,500. It was confirmed by the Western blotting method that either of the two proteins 19 K and 17 K cross reacted with any of the antibodies prepared from rabbit sera using as antigens three peptide fragments selected from an amino acid sequence predicted from the TNF cDNA sequence. However, when a protein purified from an EL coli culture that was constructed by the recombinant DNA technology and which was capable of producing the polypeptide composed of 157 amino acids see Fig. 1 as described in Pennica, D. et al., ibid for details of this protein, see Example 2 below was subjected to SDS PAGE using 13 polyacrylamide gel, it was found that the polypeptide of the present invention U 937 TNF in Fig. 7 obviously diffexed from said protein with 157 amino acids Recombinant TNF in Fig. 7 and had a lower molecular weight. Details of the process for preparing the protein made of 157 amino acids using recombinant . coli are given in Example 2 hereunder.5. Determination of NH2 terminal amino acid sequence Fraction 1 obtained in 3 c was purified by column chromatography on Matrex Blue A. The purified fraction was subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography Type LC 6A Shimadzu Seisakusho using MicrobondapackC18 column Waters . The concentrated TNF was freeze dried.Thirty micrograms 1,700 pM of the freeze dried product was supplied to gas phase protein sequencer Model 470 A AppliedBiosystems and the NH2 terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed by th Edman method. The sequence of the first 23 NH2 terminal amino acid residues was 1 5 Ser Arg Thr Pro Ser Asp Lys Pro 10 15 Val Ala His Val Val Ala Asn Pro 20 Gln Ala Glu Gly Gln Leu Gln The same results were obtained for TNF present in Fraction 2 by following the same analytical procedures.6. Heat and nH stabilitv The polypeptide of the present invention was checked for its heat and pH stability by using the hollow fiber concentrate of culture obtained in 3 a protein 0.74 mg ml, TNF ca. 0.68 . As shown in Fig. 15 a, the TNF in the concentrate remained stable up to 65 0C for a period of 30 minutes and was completely inactivated at 85 C. Another sample of the concentrate was dialyzed against adequate amounts of buffer with varying pHs for 14 hours at 40C, and subsequently dialyzed against 10 mM tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 for 1 hour at 4 C. The residual TNF activity data are shown in Fig. 16 a, from which one can see that the TNF in the concentrate remained stable over the pH range of 4.9 10.7.Example 2 1. Construction of a plasmid for producing AN4TNF a Preparation of a AN4TNF expression plasmid bv use of PLT4 promoter refer to Fig. S and Fig. 9 Plasmid pBR322 PL T4 hTNF which was separated from E.coli deposited under No. DSM 3175 was completely digested by use of Aval and HindIII to separate a DNA fragment containing the most part of the TNF gene. On the other hand, pBR322 PL T4 hTNF was decomposed by use of Clal and Hindlil to separate a DNA fragment containing a PLT4 promoter and a ss lactamase gene Apr . Then, a chemically synthesized linker DNA 5 CGATACTACTATGTCTCGAACC 3 by TATGATGATACAGAGCTTGGGGCT 5 means of a 380A DNA synthesizer by Applied Biosystem Co. which had ClaI and AvaI cohesive ends was mixed with both of the DNA fragments, and they were joined by use of T4DNA ligase to construct pPLT4tN4TNF Fig. 8 . Then, a SalI cutting site was introduced just downstream the AN4TNF structural gene termination codon according to in vitro modification shown below in order to add an E. coli Trpa transcription terminator just downstream the AN4TNF structural gene. Namely, in vitro mutation was carried out by use of chemically synthesized in vitro mutation oligonucleotide AB180 36 base oligonucleotide consisting of 5 ATCATTGCCCTGTGAGTCGACCGAACATCCAACCTT 3 and plasmid pPLT4tN4TNF according to the method by Y. Morinaga et al. Morinaga, Y. et al., Biotechnology, 2, 636 639, 1984 Fig. 9 a . That is, pPLT4tN4TNF was completely digested by use of PvuI and PstI to separate DNA fragment I in which 126 base pairs between the PvuI PstI cutting sites are eliminated. On the other hand, the same pPLT4tN4TNF was cleaved by use of Clal and Bindlil to separate DNA fragment II which was free from the TNF gene region about 0.6 kb .DNA fragments I and II qnd 36 base oligonucleotide AB180 were mixed. Denaturation of the doubnle chain DNA was carried out at 100 C and the temperature was slowly lowered to room temperature to carry out double chain formation. At the time, a DNA molecule in which DNA fragments I and II and oligonucleotide AB180 are annealed was formed. To the reaction solution were added d6TP, the Klenow fragment ofDNA polymerase, and T4DNA ligase to fill in the single chain part and to form a complete double chain, ring DNA. E. coliWA802 CI was transformed by use of the reaction solution to obtain an ampicillin resistant clone.Analysis of the plasmid DNA contained in the ampicillin resistant clone revealed that the plasmid is pPLT4 N4TNF SalI which has aSalI cutting site just downstream of the N4TNF structural gene Fig. 9 a . Then, plasmid pPLT4 N4TNFST8, in which a TrpA terminator was introduced just downstream of translation termination codon of the N4TNF gene and a tetracycline resistant gene Tcr was introduced in place of place of the ss lactamase gene Apr , was prepared by used of pPLT4tN4TNF SalI was completely digested by use of AhaIII and SalI to separate a DNA fragment containing the AN4 TNF structural gene and the PLT4 promoter region and having an AhaIII end and a SalI end, and a DNA fragment 2.6 kb having an AhaIII end and a SalI end.Also, a DNA fragment about 0.7 kb containing a TrpA terminator was obtained by digesting pIN5T8 with SalI. The threeDNA fragments were mixed and joined by addition of T4DNA ligase to construct pPLT4tN4TNFST8 Fig. 9 b . b Preparation of expression plasmid pT4 N4TNFST8rop by function of T4 promoter refer to Fig. 10, Plasmid pPLT4 N4TNF SalI refer to Fig. 9 a and Fig.9 b prepared in item a was cleaved by use of EcoRI, and theEcoRI cohesive ends were filled in by use of T4DNA polymerase and 4dNTP. Then, the plasmid was digested by use of SalI to obtain a DNA fragment about 0.6 kb containing the T4 promoter and the AN4 TNF structural gene. Plasmid pIN5T8 was cleaved by use of SalI, and a DNA fragment about 0.7 kb containing a TrpA terminator was obtained. On the other hand, plasmid pBR322 was digested by use of BalI andPvuII, and was joined by use of T4DNA ligase to obtain plasmid pBR322ABalI in which 622 base pairs between the Ball and PvuII cutting sites have been deleted. Plasmid pBR322 BalI was digested by SalI and AhaIII to separate aDNA fragment about 2 kb containing a initiating site for replication.Three types of DNA fragments thus obtained are mixed and joined to each other by use of T4DNA ligase to construct pT4 N4TNFST8rop . c Preparation of expression plasmid pIN5 N4TNFST8rop by function of lyp promoter refer to Fig. 11 Plasmid pPLT4 N4TNF SalI refer to Fig. 9 a and Fig.9 b was completely digested by use of AvaI and SalT to separate a DNA fragment about 0.45 kb containing the most part of the TNF structural gene. On the other hand, pIN5T8 was completely decomposed by use of SalI and EcoRI to obtain a DNA fragment about 2.8 kb containing lpp promoter, a replication initiation site and a portion of the tetracycline resistant gene. Also, pIN5T8 was cleaved by SalI alone to yield a DNA fragment about 0.7 kb containing theTrpA terminator. The three types of DNA fragments obtained above and a chemically synthesized EcoRI AvaI linker DNA fragment 5 AATTCATGTCTCGAACC were mixed and joined with use GTACAGAGCTTGGGGCT 5 of T4DNA ligase to construct pIN5 N4TNFST8. Then, pIN5 N4TNFST8 was digested by BindIII and NdeI to separate aDNA fragment about 1.9 kb containing the lpp promoter, the tN4TNF structural gene and the TrpA terminator. On the other hand, pBR322ABalI refer to Fig. 10 was decomposed byHindIII and NdeI to separate a DNA fragment about 1.6 kb containing the tetracycline resistant gene. The two types of DNA fragments were mixed and joined with T4DNA ligase to pIN5 N4TNFSt8rop 2.Production of N4TNF by use of transformed bacteria Plasmids for producting AN4TNF obtained in Item 1 were introduced into E. coli W3110 and WA802, respectively to yield transformant showing tetracycline resistance. As to pPLT4N4TNFST8, W3110 CI or WA802 CI which had been transformed with plasmid pCI857 which is capable of expressing a temperature sensitive repressor gene CI857 of X phage, is compatible with pBR322 and is capable of being screened by a kanamycin resistant gene as a marker, was used as the host. Examples of N4TNF producing transformant are shown below.a Production of AN4TNF by culture in a flask Transformant WA802 pT4 N4TNFST8rop and W3110 pT4 N4TNFST8rop each were inoculated in an LB medium 1 trypton, 0.58 yeast extract, 0.5 NaCl, pH 7.0 containing 10 g ml of tetracycline, and were cultured at 370C until the latter stage of logarithmic phase of bacterial growth. Two milliliter portion of each of the culture mixture was added to 200 ml of a GC medium 2 glycerin, 3 casamino acid, 0.5 K2HPO4, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.18 MgSO4 7H20, pH 6.5 containing 10 vg ml of tetracycline, and the mixture was cultured in a 1,000 ml Erlenmeyer flask with shaking at 250 rpm at 37 0C for 15 hours. The amount of bacterial cells and the TNF productivity were measured for the culture mixture each. The results are shown in Table 3.OD660 indicates the amount of bacterial cells, and the TNF activities are shown in terms of activities of samples prepared according to the following method. That is, a 0.5 ml portion of the culture mixture was subjected to centrifugation, and the bacterial cells obtained were lysed by suspending them with 0.5 ml of 250 g ml of lysozyme Grade 1 Egg alubmin lysozyme manufactured by Sigma Co. in a PBS solution manufactured by Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd. , reacting the suspension at 0 C for 30 minutes, and repeating three times rapid freezing on an ethanol dry ice bath and thawing at 37 C. The lysed mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was used as a sample for measurement of TNF activities. Also, analysis of the bacterial cells were carried out according to SDS polyacrylamida gel electrophoresis SDSPAGE as follows. That is, a 0.2 ml portion of the culture mixture was subjected to centrifugation to collect the bacterial cells, and the cells obtained by removal of the supernatant were suspended in 0.15 ml of a SDS sample solution 10 glycerin, 5 2 mercapto ethanol, 2.38 SDS, 62.5 mM tris hydrochloric acid, pH 6.8 . The suspension was heated at 1000C for 10 minutes. A portion of the mixture was subjected to electrophoretis separation by 15 SDS PAGE according to a conventional method before protein dyeing with Coomassie Blue. As a result, a band corresponding to AN4TNF protein having a molecular weight of about 17 K was detected. In contrast, the host EL coli which has not been transformed and cultured in a manner similar to that described above showed no band corresponding to the protein of 17 K.

After culture a portion of the culture mixture was sampled, and a crude extract solution was prepared according to the method described in Item 2 a to investigate the TNF activities.The results are shown in Table 4. As seen from the table, each of the transformed bacteria showed high TNF activities. The fact that the same transformed bacteria show the productivities higher than those in Table 3 is probably due to a difference in culture conditions. Also, the culture liquids of the above transformed bacteria were subjected to SDS PAGE according to the method described above Item 2 a l. As a results, a thick protein band was noted at a position of about 17 K molecular weight corresponding to AN4TNF polypeptide, from which it A was recognized that the transformed bacteria produce N4TNF in high yields.Table 4 Production of ssN4TNF by means of a jar fermenterEMI28.1 tb SEP Transformed SEP bacteria SEP OD660 SEP TNF SEP activities tb SEP AN4 SEP tb SEP WA802 CI pPLT4 SEP TNFST8 SEP 22.1 SEP 5.7 SEP x SEP 106 tb SEP WA802 pT4 N4TNFST8rop SEP 18.7 SEP 2.9 SEP x SEP 107 tb SEP W3110 pT4 N4TNFST8rop SEP SEP 22.7 SEP 3.0 SEP x SEP 107 tb 3. Measurements of TNF activities Measurements of TNF activities were carried out as follows according to a slight improvement of the method described in Ruff, M. R. and Gifford, E. G. Lymphokines, Ed. Pick, E. vol 2, 235 272, Academic Press, New York 1981 .That is, 0.1 ml of a 6 x 105 cells ml suspension in the medium below of L 929 cell ATCC entrusted No.CCL 1 which was a substrain of a mouce L cell and was in the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth was added to each hole of a flat bottom type tissue culture microplate with 96 holes manufactured by Nunc Co. each of which contains 0.1 ml of a sample diluted stepwise with an Eagle MEM medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum, 0.1 NaHCO3 and 0.03 glutamine. Actinomycin D manufactured by Makor ChemicalCo. was added beforehand to each hole so that it amounts finally to 1 vg ml. Then, the microplate described above was treated at 370C for about 18 hours in air containing 5 CO2 for culture.After culture, the supernatant was removed, and 0.1 ml of an aqueous 0.5 Crystal Violet solution containing 20 methanol was added to each hole so as to stain the L 929 cells adhering thereto for 15 minutes at room temperature. The stained microplate was washed with water, and 0.1 ml of a 33 acetic acid aqueous solution was added to extract pigments from the stained cells. The absorbance of the extract at 577 nm was measured by aTitertek Multiskan Spectrophotbmeter. The reciprocal of a dilution magnification of the sample showing an absorbance corresponding to 50 of the absorbance of the control was used to represent the TNF activities of the sample in terms of unit ml. At least 4 runs of measurements were carried out for one sample, and the average value was calculated.4. Purification of polypeptide N4TNF The method of purification of polypeptide havingTNF activities was described in Example 1 above. ThisExample 2 describes a process for purifying the polypeptide having TNF activities from cultured bacterial body of WA802 pT4 N4TNFST8rop , E. coli transformed by plasmid pT4 N4TNFSt8rop obtained in Item 1 above. Recombinant E. coli WA802 pT4 N4TNFST8rop was cultivated with shaking in 2 Q of a GC medium 2 glycerin, 3 casamino acid, 0.5 KH2PO4, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.1 MgSO4 7H2O, pH 6.5 containing tetracycline 10 vg ml at 37 C for 14 hours by use of a 3 Q jar fermenter. After collection of bacterial cells by centrifugation, the cells were suspended in a 10 mM tris hydrochloric acid buffer pH 8.0 will be abbreviated as Tris buffer pH 8.0 hereinafter amounting to about 7 times as much as the amount of the wet bacterial cells. The cells were disrupted by use of a Manton Gaulin Laboratory Homogenizer 15M 8TA with cooling.The mixture obtained was subjected to centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 20 minutes. Then, polyethyleneimine PEW manufactured by BASF Co. was added to a concentration of 0.28 to a 700 ml portion of the supernatant, and the mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 minutes to yield 680 ml of a supernatant fraction crude extract . The crude extract had TNF activities of 1.25 x 107 unit ml 7.8 x 106 unit mg protein . Then, ammonium sulfate was added to the crude extract to an 80 saturation, and the mixture was centrifuged to precipitate proteins.The proteins obtained were dissolved in 120 ml of a 10 mMTris buffer pH 8.0 , and, after sufficiently dialyzed against the same buffer, were subjected to anion exchange chromatography with a carrier DEAE Toyopearl 650 C manufactured by Toyo Soda Co. sufficiently equilibrated with the buffer. After sufficiently washing the column with the Tris buffer pH 8.0 , NaCl solution in the Tris buffer pH 8.0 having a linear concentration gradient from 0 mM to 300 mM was used to elute the adsorbed proteins. Fractions having TNF activities were eluted at a NaCl concentration of about 50 mM to 60 mM Fig. 12 .Then, a 100 ml portion of the fractions having TNF activities was diluted with a Trisbuffer pH 7 to make up the total volume to 200 ml, and the solution was subjected to column chromatography using DEAESepharose CL 6B manufactured by Pharmacia Co. equilibrated with the Tris buffer pE 7 . After sufficiently washing with the buffer, a NaCl solution in the Tris buffer pH 7 having a linear concentration gradient from 0 mM to 200 mM was used for elution. As a result, a large porption of the proteins were eluted at a NaC1 concentration of 60 mM to 70 mM Fig. 13 , and fractions having TNF activities were also eluted in the same concentration. Then, a 120 ml portion of the fractions showing TNF activities was subjected. to column chromatography on Matrex Blue A manufactured by AmiconCo. , a dye adsorption affinity carrier, sufficiently equilibrated with the Tris buffer pH 7 .Fractions havingTNF activitires or protein were eluted with the Tris buffer pH 8 . Also, the peak of the protein eluted was in good conformity with the peak of TNF activities Fig. 14 . This indicates that the protein having TNF activities is specifically adsorbed by Matrex Blue A at pH 7.0 and is desorbed at pH 8.0. In contrast, the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids shown in Fig. 1 is adsorbed by the above carrier at both of pH 7.0 and pH 8.0. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the salt concentration, for example, by use of sodium chloride, in the Tris buffer pH 8 for the desorption of the polypeptide from the carrier. The polypeptide purified by column chromatography on the above dye adsorption affinity carrier showed an approximately single band by SDS PAGE. This indicates that the polypeptide has a purity of 95 or more at the stage.The polypeptide having TNF activities obtained above was adsorbed again on DEAE Sepharose CL 6B equilibrated with theTris buffer pH 7 , and was eluted by a solution having a constant pH of 7.0 and having simultaneous linear gradients of the tris hydrochloric acid concentration and the NaCl concentration of from 10 mM to 200 mM and 0 mM to 100 mM, respectively to purify the polypeptide at a purity of 99 or more. The polypeptide was used as the final N4TNF sample.The authentic sample had TNF activities of 2.2 x 107 unit mg of protein on the average, and it could be further purified about 13 times in an about 60 yield from the crude extract.The authentic sample could further be purified by use ofSephacryl 5 200, a gel filtration carrier. The results of purification at each process are shown in Table 5. Also, the SDS PAGE pattern of the fraction having TNF activities from Sephacryl S 200 column chromatography was shown in Fig.21.

Phvsical and chemical properties of the polypeptide Purified a Amino acid composition refer to Table 6 The fraction having TNF activities obtained by DEAESepharose CL 6B coumn chromatography after Matrex Blue A column chromatography in the above item was further purified by a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography Shimadzu Seisakusho Ltd. using a Microbonder pack C18 column manufactured by Waters Co. before amino acid analysis. About 15 ug of a sample was hydrolyzed with 100 p1 of 6N HC1 in a sealed tube under reduced pressure at 11OOC for 24 hours and 72 hours, and the hydrolyzed product was dried under reduced pressure. Then, 200 1 of 0.02N HCl was added to the product to determine the amino acid composition by means of an automatic amino acid analyzer Model 835 50 manufactured by Hitachi Seisakusho Ltd . The ratio of the number of molecules for each amino acid are shown in Table 6 with the number of molecules of leucine Leu as standard 18.0 . The results were close to the theoretical amino acid composition of tN4TNF. In the table, the value for tryptophan Trp is a value determined after hydrolysis in a sealed tube at 110 C for 24 hours with 3 moles of mercaptoethane sulfonic acid, and the value for cysteine Cys is value determined for cysteinic acid after oxidation with performic acid and hydrolysis at 110 0C for 24 hours with 6N HC1. Concerning the presence of methionine Met at the amino terminus in the purified polypeptide, the above amino acid analysis revealed that the purified polypeptide has about 5 formylated or free form of methionine.

The inventors further investigated the TNF activity specific activity of a polypeptide TNF which was purified in a manner similar to that in Item 4 in theExample from cultured bacterial cells of E. coliWA802 pT4TNFST8rop that has an ability to produce a polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids Fig. 1 TNF and was transformed by plasmid pT4TNFST8rop obtained by improvement of plamsid pBR322 PL T4 hTNF DSM 3175 . The results are shown in Table 7.The specific activity of N4TNF was 5.9 10 x 107 unit mg protein, whereas that of the polypeptide consisiting of 157 amino acids was 2.6 6.2 7 A 10 unit mg protein, thus, it was t specific activity higher than that of the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids. Also, a slight difference in the TNF activities of N4TNF in Table 5 and Table 7 will probably be due to errors in measurements. The results of SDS PAGE of both polypeptides purified are shown in Fig. 21. Both showed obviously different patterns. The estimated molecular weight of N4 TNF was about 17,000 1,500 in comparison with the electrophoretic patterns of standard proteins.Table 7 Comparison of bactercidal activities between AN4TNF produced by recombinant R. coli and the polypeptide TNF consisting of 157 amino acidsEMI35.1 tb Experiments SEP Activity SEP Protein SEP Specific SEP activity tb SEP unit ml SEP mg mI SEP unit mg SEP protein tb SEP ssN4TNF SEP 3.0 SEP x SEP 107 SEP SEP 0.39 SEP 10.0 SEP x SEP 107 SEP tb SEP n 4 tb SEP TNF SEP 1.8 SEP x SEP 107 SEP 0.29 SEP 6.2 SEP x SEP 107 tb SEP n 4 tb SEP 1.7 SEP x SEP 107 SEP 0.31 SEP 5.5 SEP x SEP 107 tb SEP n 4 tb SEP N4TNF SEP SEP 1.6 SEP x SEP 107 SEP 0.27 SEP 5.9 SEP x SEP 107 tb SEP n 4 tb II SEP 3.9 SEP x SEP 10 SEP 1.

Before the chromatofocusing, both of the polypeptides were purified by a due adsorption affinity chromatography followed by DEAE Sepharose CL 6B chromatography Item 4 in the Example refer to Fig. 20 . Chromatofocusing was carried out by use of PBE 94 manufactured by Pharmacia Co. , a column for chromatofocusing use, and flowing a 10 fold dilution of Polybuffer 74 manufactured by Pharmacia Co. adjusted at pH 4.0 with hydrochloric acid through the column to make a pH gradient to elute both polypeptides. The results are shown in Fig. 22. AN4TNF was eluted at a pH of 5.4 5.1 5.2 0.2 , whereas the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids were eluted at a pH of 5.7 5.3 5.5 0.2 . Thus, it was noted that the isoelectric points of the two polypeptides are oviously different by chromatofocusing measurements.d thermal and pH stabilities refer to Fig. 15 b and Fia. 16 b The pH and the thermal stabilities were investigated for fractions containing SN4TNF and the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids refer to Fig. 1 . Both polypeptides were purified by a dye adsorption affinity chromatography followed by DEAE Sepharose chromatography Item 4 in the Example Fig. 20 . As to the pH stability, the above samples having the same stabilities were dialyzed against a sufficient amount of buffer adjusted at each pH shown in Fig. 16 b at 40C for 14 hours, and then against a 10 mM tris hydrochloric acid buffer pH 7.5 at 40C for 1 hour to measure the residual activities. The results are shown in Fig. 16 b. As can be seen from the results, the residual activity of AN4TNF was higher than that of the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids at a pH of 11 or more and 4.5 or less. As to the thermostability, the residual activities were observed for the above samples after causing to stand for 30 minutes at each temperature shown in Fig. 15 b. As can be seen from the results, tN4TNF showed residual activities higher than those of the polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids at a temperature of 75 C. Thus, it was revealed that N4TNF is a polypeptide obviously different from and superior to the conventionally known polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids in terms of physical and chemical properties. 6. tN4TNF preparations One mg of AN4TNF of a 99 or more purity obtained inItem 4 above, 50 mg of mannitol and 9 mg of sodium chloride were dissolved in 1 ml of a phosphoric acid buffer pH 7.2 , and the solution was freeze dried to prepared a tN4TNF preparation. The preparation was dissolved in 1 ml of pure water, and the resulting solution was injected intravenously or at the affected part in tumor bearing mice at a dose of 0.2 ml to 1 ml per kg. Also, a preparation containing 1 mg of AN4TNF, 50 mg of mannitol, 9 mg of sodium chloride and 1 mg each of serum albumin or gelatin, and a preparation containing 1 mg of N4TNF, 50 mg of mannitol, 9 mg of sodium chloride, 10 mg of glycine or 0.1 mg of polyethylene glycol 4000 were prepared.Each preparation was formed by freeze drying after dissolution in 1 ml of a phosphoric acid buffer of pH 7.2. The tN4TNF preparations should not be limited to the above compositions, and the pH of the phosphoric acid buffer may be 5.5 9.0, and 1 ml of the phosphoric acid buffer may contain 0.05 5.0 mg of tN4TNF and 8 12 mg of sodium chloride. Reference Examle A culture of E. coli transformant, WA802 pT4TNFST8rOP, constructed by the recombinant DNA technology so as to produce TNF active polypeptide made of 157 amino acids see Fig. 1 was subjected to the same purification steps as shown above, and the polypeptide obtained had TNF activity which was at least 99 pure. Since the purification steps used to obtain this polypeptide were the same as those described above, details thereof are replaced by Figs. 17 to 20 which show the chromatograms obtained in the respective steps. Fig. 17 shows the result of column chromatography onDEAE Sepharose CL 6B performed in the second step of the purification scheme Fig. 18 shows the result of column chromatography on Matrex Blue A performed in the third step Fig. 19 shows the result of subsequent chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose CL 4B and Fig. 20 shows the result of chromatography on Sephacryl 5 200. Two samples of polypeptide having TNF activity were obtained by the above procedures of purification as shown in Fig. 21, SDS PAGE analysis of these samples revealed that they were substantially pure and made of polypeptides with apparently different sizes. The method of purification from the culture of recombinant microorganism described above could also be applied to the purpose of purification from cultures of other recombinant ZA coli strains having the ability to produce polypeptide with TNF activity, as well as to the purification from recombinant EL coli cells cultured on media other than those used in Example 2.
