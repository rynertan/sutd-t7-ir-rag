# A film or skin packaging machine.

## Abstract
A film heating oven for a skin packaging machine. The oven has a metallic housing in which are supported a plurality of elongated heaters in spaced parallel relationship. The heaters are energized by a control system which raises their temperature for heating the film and lowers the temperature during other operations of the machine. The housing includes a reflector for each tube to direct the heat downwardly onto the film and further includes an outer covering of insulation to minimize the escape of heat.
