## Description
DESCRIPTIONTITLE NON ENKEPHALIN LIKE PEPTIDES, THEIR PRODUCTION, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM, AND THEIR MEDICAL AND VETERINARY USE THIS INVENTION rel ates to new peptides exhibiting analgesic activity, to their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their medicinal and veterinary use. Recently, morphine receptor and enkephalin receptor sites have been identified, see for exampleKwen Jen Chang and Pedro Cuatrecasas, The Journal ofBiological Chemistry, vol. 254, No. 8, April 25, 1979, pp 2610 2618. It has been speculated that a good analgesic activity would be exhibited if one could provide compounds which would more strongly bind to the morphine 4 receptor site than to the enkephalin 6 receptor site. We have now discovered new peptides that bind substantially more strongly to the morphine 4 receptor site than to the enkephalin 6 site and also exhibit analgesic activity. Because of the strong binding to the 4 sites, less compound in comparison with enkephalin analogue compounds is needed to achieve analgesic activity. In addition, because of high selectivity to the morphine receptor site the new peptides can be expected to produce less side effects than morphine. The present invention provides a peptide of the general formula I A B C Z R2 n I where n is 0 or 1. A is.Tyr, N alkyl Tyr where the alkyl group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and is preferably methyl or ethyl, or N alkenyl Tyr where the alkenyl group has 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and is preferably allyl, the Tyr in each case having L chirality. B is Pro L , 3,4 dehydro Pro L , 4 hydroxyPro L , Thz L or Pip L . C is Phe L or D , N alkyl Phe L or D , a alkyl Phe L or D , in each of the above the alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbons and is preferably methyl. Z is Pro L or D , Leu L or D , Thz L or D ,Tyr L or D , Pip L or D , Hse L or D , Nva L or 4 hydroxy Pro L or D , Met L or D , Met 02 L or D ,Ile L or D , Nle L or D , Met O L or D , Gly, Abu L or D , Val L or D , Aib, 3,4 dehydro Pro L or cyclo Leu L or D R2 is Gly NH2, OR5, where R5 is an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably methyl or ethyl , or a group NR6R7 where R6 and R7 are the same or different and each is hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms preferably methyl , and, when n is 0, the alcohols resulting from reduction of the peptide A B C Z, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, except that where n is 1 and A is Tyr and B is Pro andC is Pile1 and Z is Pro, R2is not NH2 and except that where n is 0, A is Tyr and B is Pro, and C is Phe, Z is not Pro.In the above L and D define the chirality of the amino acid. In the peptide formula representations used herein for peptides within the definition of formula I the amino terminal amino acid is at the left side of the molecule and is represented by Tyr when the amino group is unsubstituted as is conventional in the art. When the amino group of the tyrosine moiety is substituted, the substitution is indicated in the conventional manner, e.g. N Me Tyr for N methyltyrosine. Also as is conventional in the art, the carboxy terminal amino acid is at the right side of the molecule and is represented by the appropriate amino acid symbol when the carboxy group is unsubstituted, i.e. COOH, or by the appropriate amino acid symbol followed by the appropriate modifying symbols indicating the nature of the substitution for modified carboxy groups, e.g. NH2 indicatesEMI3.1 and ol is CH2OH. In this Specification, the following abbreviations, most of which are well known and are commonly used in peptide chemistry are employed Abu a aminobutyric acid Aib a amino iso butyric acid Ala alanine Gly glycine Hse homoserine Ile isoleucine Leu leucine Met methionine Nle norleucine Nva norvaline Phe phenylalanine Tyr tyrosine Val valineThz isEMI3.2 Pip isEMI4.1 Reference may alsd be made to Biochemistry, 11, 1726 1972 for the definition of the above abbreviations. The most preferred compound for its analgesic activity is Tyr Pro N Me Phe D Pro NH2. Other compounds of the invention having high analgesic activity are Tyr Pro N Me Pile D Pro ol Tyr Thz N Me Phe D Pro NH2 Tyr Pro Phe Thz NH2 Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention include non toxic acid addition salts where n is 1 and include the organic and inorganic acid addition salts1 for example, those prepared from acids such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, sulphonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, glycolic, citric, lactic, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic, nitric, benzoic, ascorbic, p toluenesulphonic, benzenesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, propionic and the like. Preferably, the acid addition salts are those prepared from hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or succinic acid. The above salts are prepared by conventional methods. Where n is 0, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include alkali metal salts1 e.g.Na or K, or ammonium salts. In the above and in this disclosure all references are to the L amino acids and their radicals except in the case of glycine and Aib and unless otherwise indicated. The term ,alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms is intended to include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec. butyl and tert butyl. Examples of other peptides of the invention are Tyr Pro Phe D Leu SH2 Tyr 3, 4 dehydro Pro N Me Phe D Pro NH2 Tyr 4 hydroxy Pro N Me Phe D Pro NH2 Tyr Pip N Me Phe D Pro NH2 Tyr Pro N Me Phe D Pro N Me Tyr Pro N Me Phe D Pro NH2 Tyr Pro N Me Phe Pro NH2 Tyr Pro N Me Phe D Pro Gly NH2 In the acid addition salts of the peptides of this invention, the activity resides in the base and the particular salt is of less importance although for therapeutic purposes it is preferably pharmaceutically acceptable to the recipient. Likewise in the salts of the peptides comprising the peptide as the carboxylated anion together with a cation the identity of the cation is of less importance for therapeutic purposes. The peptides of formula I and their salts and acid addition salts may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art for the preparation of peptide compounds. Thus they may be formed by the sequential coupling of appropriate amino acids using either classical methods of peptide synthesis or solid phase procedures, e.g. using a Schwarz Mann Automatic Synthesizer, or by the initial preparation and subsequent coupling of peptide subunits. Such reaction may be affected by, for example, activating the carboxylic acid group of the ingoing amino acid and protecting the non reacting amino and carboxylic acid groups. Such techniques are standard in the peptide art. Details of suitable activating and protecting masking groups and of suitable reaction conditions both for the coupling reaction and for the removal of of protecting groups giving the minimum of racemisation may be found in the following literature, all of which is incorporated herein by reference hereto, which is given purely by way of exemplification and which is intended to be neither exhaustive nor limiting. a Published United Kingdom Patent Specifications Nos. 1,042,487 1,048,086 and 1,281,383. b Schroder and Luebke, The Peptides Academic Press 1965 . c Bellean and Malek, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 90, 165 1968 d Tilak, Tetrahedron Letters, 849 1970 e Beyerman, Hlv. Chim. Acta., 56, 1729 1973 f Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis W.H. Freeman and Co. 1969 . Depending upon the reaction conditions the peptides of formula I are obtained in the form of the free base or as an acid addition salt or salt thereof.The acid addition salts may be converted into the free bases or salts of other acids, and the bases may be converted into acid addition salts thereof, by techniques well known in the art. Likewise the peptides may be converted to salts thereof, and the salts converted to the peptides or to other salts, by well established techniques. The peptides of formula I , and their salts and acid addition salts may thus be prepared by condensing a reagent III E OH III wherein E is A or A B or A B C or, when n is 1 and R2 is GlyNH2, E may be A B C Z with a reagent IV H Y IV wherein Y is B C Z R2 n or C Z R2 n or z R2 n or GlyNH2 respectively, the reagents III and IV being optionally protected and or activated where and as appropriate followed if necessary and as appropriate by one or both of the steps of deprotection of the product and conversion of the product into the base or a salt or an acid addition salt thereof. It will also be appreciated that other in situ conversions of the peptides of formula I are possible. Thus the peptides wherein R2 is a group NR6R7 may 67Thus the peptides wherein R may be prepared by for example reaction of a peptide alkyl ester wherein R2 is OR5 where R5 is alkyl such as the methyl ester with ammonia or a mono or diamine, as appropriate.The peptide esters may be prepared from the peptide acids is is OR5 where R5is hydrogen by standard esterification procedures and the esters may be converted to the peptide acids by saponification. All these are conventional techniques in the peptide art and reference may be made to the literature referred to hereinabove for details of reaction conditions and of appropriate protection deprotection procedures. Because of their analgesic activity and specificity in attachment to the morphine receptor already mentioned, the peptides of formula I together with their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and acid addition salts may be used in the treatment of mammals in the fields of both human and veterinary medicine in any condition where an analgesic is indicated. Specific indications that may be mentioned, by way of example, include the following The relief of pain analgesia , for example pain arising from spasm of smooth muscle as in renal or biliary colic, pain due to terminal illness such as cancer, pain in the post operative period, and obstetrical pain. The amount of the peptides of formula I and their salts and acid addition salts, that is to say, for use as an analgesic hereafter referred to as the active ingredient will vary with the route of administration and with the nature and required extent of the desired effect, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician or veterinarian. In general, however, for the use as an analgesic the preferred dosage will be in the range 1 to 40 mg per kilogram bodyweight of mammal, e.g.dog, cat, humans, more preferably 1 to 10.0 mg kg, most preferably 1.0 to 4.0 mg kg, given two to three times daily all dosages calculated with reference to the peptide base . For use as an analgesic for human a 3 mg.single dose given two or three times daily is preferred. The active ingredients may be administered by any route appropriate to the effect to be achieved, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical buccal , vaginal and parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intracerebral, i.e. in the brain . It will be appreciated that the preferred route will vary with the effect to be achieved and thus for example in the relief of obstetrical pain administration directly into the spinal cord may be advantageous. While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered as the pure chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical formulation. The formulations, both veterinary and for human use, of the present invention comprise an active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier s must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient patient thereof. Desirably, the formulations should not include oxidising agents and other substances with which peptides are known to be incompatible. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical buccal , vaginal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend upon for example the active ingredient and the condition to be treated. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oil inwater liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion.The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter, while a suitable formulation for nasal administration is nasal drops comprising the active ingredient in aqueous or oily solution. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, creams, pastes or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient, which solutions are preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulations may be conveniently prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering said solution sterile and isotonic with the blood of the recipient. The formulations may be presented in unit or in multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules or vials. Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. It should be understood that in addition to the aforementioned ingredients the formulations of this invention may include one or more additional ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including anti oxidants and the like. Where the formulation, for human or for veterinary use is presented in unit dosage form, for example those unit dosage forms specifically mentioned above, each unit thereof conveniently contains the active ingredient as above defined in an amount in the range 50 mg to 2 g., and preferably 50 to 200 mg all weights calculated with reference to the peptide base . The compounds of this invention preferentially bind to and occupy morphine opiate receptor sites in comparison with their binding to the enkephalin receptor sites. The preferred compounds of this invention are at least 100 times more preferentially bound to morphine receptor sites than to the enkephalin receptor sites. The compounds of this invention may also be radio labelled, e.g. with 125I, 3H etc. in a conventional manner and used in binding affinity assays to determine binding of morphine, enkephalins or other peptide compounds to morphine receptor sites. Thus the compounds of this invention of formula I are also useful as intermediates to prepare radioactive labelled compounds which are useful to scientists engaged in mammalian medical studies. The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention but should not be construed as in any way providing a limitation thereof. All temperatures are in degree Celsius.

EXAMPLE 11 Analqesic Activity The acetate salts of formula I described inExamples 1 to 3 were tested for analgesic activity in the rat tail withdrawal assay. In this test, latencies to withdraw the tail from hot 55 C water are measured 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes after administration of the acetate salts. Latencies of 5 seconds or greater indicate strong analgesic activity and 20 seconds is a maximum response in this test. The peptides were administered intracisternally or intravenously. A. Intracisternal Administration The acetate salt was dissolved in 10 jil of sterile saline and injected intracisternally into the rat brain. 1 The formula I acetates of Examples 1 and 3 were administered at a dose of 10 jig per rat brain.
