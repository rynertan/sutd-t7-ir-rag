# ADSORBENT SHEET MATERIAL

## Abstract
An adsorptive sheet material which comprises a breath able substrate sheet 1 and short fibers 2 of active carbon bonded thereto by electrostatic flocking. The short fibers of active carbon are bonded perpendicular to the substrate at one end only. Because of this structure, they are durable when the substrate is bent. The adsorptive sheet material is superior in breathability, permeability, and flexibility, and is light in weight, while it maintains the adsorptive properties of active carbon fibers.
