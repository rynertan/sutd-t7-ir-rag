# Extendible rocket engine nozzle.

## Abstract
Nozzle extending means for a rocket engine 13 of a space vehicle comprising a doughnut shaped, main inflat able vessel MIV 26 and a doughnut shaped, secondary inflatable vessel SIV 56 located within the central hole in the MIV 26 . An extendible nozzle section ENS 10 with hook means 74 at its front end telescopes around a fixed nozzle section FNS 12 . Radially extending locking arms 14 have hooks 20 at their outer ends which engage a flange 18 at the rear end of the ENS 10 . The locking arms 14 are supported by and move with a rear support plate 29 which is affixed to the rear surface of the MIV 26 . Pressurized gas is used to inflate the MIV 26 thereby pulling the ENS 10 rearward until it is positioned at the rear of the FNS 12 to form a fully extended nozzle. When in this position, the ENS 10 locks to the FNS 12 by means of a hook 74 on the front end of the ENS 10 and a sealing ring 84 on the rear end of the FNS 12 . When the MIV 26 is at or near full extension and pressurization, a pressure sensitive valve 70 opens to permit gas from the MIV 26 to inflate the SIV 26 . Inflation of the SIV 56 moves an associated, notched piston shaft 64 to the rear, moving force transmitting members 38 and the locking arms 14 to which these members 38 are coupled radially outward, thereby disengaging the hooks 22 from the FNS flange 18 so that the nozzle extending means can be jettisoned. Full expansion of the SIV 56 also acts to pull a plurality of anvils 33 , which are attached to tongues 30 in front of the MIV 26 , into contact with pressure drain valves 39 in the front surface of the MIV 26 . This contact opens the valves 39 and allows gas to move from the MIV 26 into the FNS space 92 in front of the MIV 26 . The pressure of the gas ih this space pushed all nozzle extending and deployment com ponents out of the extended nozzle volume.
