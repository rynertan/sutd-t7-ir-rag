# Pneumatic booster.

## Abstract
A pneumatic booster includes a housing 4 , a power piston 4 partitioning the interior of the housing into a front chamber A and a rear chamber B , with the front chamber being connected permanently to a source of a first reference pressure, the rear chamber being selectively communicated with the front chamber and a source of second reference pressure which is higher than the first reference pressure through a valve mechanism, an output shaft 15 receiving the output force from the power piston, and an input shaft 10 receiving an input force for actuating said valve mechanism and receiving a reaction force of the output force. There is provided a device 16, 18 28, 29 between the output shaft 15 and the power piston 4 for changing the reaction force with respect to the output force on the output shaft, a mechanism 23 for rotating the output shaft 15 around the axis thereof, and a device 8 for preventing the rotation of the power piston relative to the housing at least at the non actuated condition of the pneumatic booster.
