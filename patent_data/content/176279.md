## Description
The present invention relates to plastic caps which snap on to the necks of thin walled plastic containers and which are tamper resistant. Thus, in order to withdraw the cap from the neck, it is necessary for the consumer to tear a portion of the skirt off the cap. The remainder of the cap comprises a reclosure cap which may be used repeatedly until the contents of the container are dispensed. The container neck is of a structure which is complementary to the cap, and it is desirable for the combination of cap and container neck to be liquid tight and tamper resistant. Cap and neck constructions of this general type are shown in United States Patent 3,338,446 and, more recently, in United States patent 4,202,455. In each of these, complementary beads on the interior of the outer skirt of the cap snap into grooves on the container neck. In the latter patent, the beads are interrupted. A circumferential scoreline is located in the outer skirt intermediate the beads and a second scoreline extends down from the circumferential scoreline to the bottom edge of the skirt. A tear tab on the bottom of the skirt may be gripped and torn upward, causing the cap to tear on the second scoreline and thence around the circumferential scoreline. To prevent dishonest patrons from prying the cap off by inserting the fingernails under the bottom edge of the cap, a horizontal shoulder is formed on the necks immediately below the bottom edge of the skirt such, for example, as shown in United States Patent 4,438,857. Container necks have also been provided with an outwardly bulging ring which is engaged by automatic filling, capping and loading machinery to lift the filled container and load the same into a box. The shoulder below the bottom edge of the skirt may constitute outward protrusions of the neck of the container separated by narrow gaps distributed around the circumference of the shoulder to inhibit the use of the fingernails or conventional prying instruments to remove the cap from the neck before the outer skirt has been torn away. Further, the bumper ring may be made interrupted rather than continuous, the gaps between the interrupted segments of the bumper ring affording strength resisting tendency of the neck to collapse when pressure is applied to seat the cap on the neck. In order to remove the upper portion of the cap, in its reclosure phase, and also to increase the area available for information such as the name of the seller, a trademark and a listing of the ingredients of the contents of the container, caps have been provided with peripheral flanges. A foil seal may be applied to the lip of the neck of the container and secured thereto by inductive heating or other means. Such a seal may be initially installed in the inside of the cap and held therein prior to application of the cap to the neck by the internal beads of the skirt of the cap. Various flanges have been used on the reclosure cap to permit the user to pry off the reclosure cap however, it is important that the flange not be capable of use to pry the entire cap off the neck prior to tearing of the cap skirt. One prior alternative has been to make the flange flexible, as shown in United States Patent 4,166,552. It is also known from US 4437593 to make the flange having a short vertical edge surface and an underside comprising a slanted portion slanting down inwardly from the edge surface to merge with the exterior of the skirt. According to the present invention there is disclosed a plastic cap for sealing a container neck having a top finish comprising a top disc having a depending skirt, said skirt having first bead means extending around the inside of said skirt spaced downward from said disc, second bead means extending around the inside of said skirt spaced below said first bead means, a first scoreline extending circumferentially around said skirt spaced between said first and second bead means, a second scoreline extending up from the bottom edge of said skirt and merging with said first scoreline, tear means on said bottom edge adjacent said scoreline, whereby by pulling said tear means the bottom of said skirt may be torn off by tearing upward along said second scoreline and then around said first scoreline, said first and second bead means being engageable with third and fourth bead means, respectively, on the exterior of said neck to prevent removal of said cap without tearing off the portion of said skirt below said first scoreline, and including a flange around the top of the exterior of said skirt, said flange assisting in removal of said cap when said portion of said skirt below said first scoreline is torn off, the underside of said flange comprising a slanted portion slanting downwardly inwardly to merge with the exterior of said skirt, characterised by the slanted portion terminating at the upper edge of the flange. An advantage of such a cap is that, in the absence of a short vertical edge surface, there is no surface on the flange which can be gripped in an effort to pull the cap off the container before tearing off the portion of the skirt below the first scoreline. Preferably the cap further comprises a seal disc beneath said top disc inside said skirt and above said first bead means whereby when said cap is applied to said neck said seal disc fits tightly against said top finish and is sealable with said top finish so that access to said neck cannot be obtained without tearing open said seal disc, said first means retaining said seal disc within said cap prior to installation of said cap on said neck. Preferably the seal disc is foil and adheres to said neck finish upon being heated. A further improvement of the invention is achievable when the neck is formed with a shoulder below the bottom edge of the skirt, which shoulder is interrupted so as to inhibit the fingernails or a prying instrument being used to pull the cap off the neck without tearing the neck and providing evidence of tampering. Although an interrupted shoulder of this type has been used heretofore, the use of such a feature with the improved cap and neck structure herein disclosed, including the lengthened skirt, peripheral reclosure cap flanges and cooperating beads and grooves on the cap and neck augment this feature. Additionally, the interrupted bumper ring, although used with other cap and neck structures, is particularly effective with the features of the invention herein disclosed in detail, including, by way of example, the bead structures on the interior of the cap skirt and and the grooves on the container neck, which mate therewith, all of which facilitate seating the cap on the neck without collapsing or crushing the neck. In accordance with present invention, means are provided to inhibit the fingernails from being used to pry the flange upward. In one form of the invention, the underside of the flange is slanted downwardly inwardly at an angle of about 45 Further improvements relate to the shapes of the upper and lower beads on the interior of the cap skirt. Such beads may be made thinner and continuous rather than interrupted and yet achieve the advantages of interrupted beads in that they permit the cap to distort outwardly during the capping procedure without likelihood of collapsing the neck. An advantage of thinner beads which are continuous is that the foil is retained within the cap more effectively and there is little possibility of the container being capped without the seal being in place. Other bead features are described hereinafter. An alternative is the staggering of the bead sections in such manner that the sections of the upper bead overlap the gaps between the bead sections of the lower bead. Alternatively, the sections of the upper and lower beads may be of approximately the same length and approximately in line, rather than staggered. The cap of the present invention may be used with a foil seal liner as heretofore explained. However, alternatively, an inner skirt which seals against the inside of the container neck may be used and many of the features heretofore described are also applicable with caps having such inner skirt construction. The inner skirt prevents use of the invention with a foil closure on the rim of the neck. Such foil seal is particularly useful with containers for pharmaceuticals since they provide an additional indicator of tampering. On the other hand, liquid and some solid products are not so sensitive to tampering and the use of an inner skirt or plug is particularly desirable with such caps and cap container neck combinations. Further a foil seal may be installed in the cap prior to the cap being applied to the container neck and, when the cap is thus applied, comes in intimate contact with the rim of the container neck so that it may be sealed thereto by inductive heating or other means. The use of continuous, or at least longer upper bead sections, more effectively retains the foil seal in place in the interval between its installation and its application to the container neck. The shapes of the top and bottom beads hereinafter described are more effective in preventing crushing or collapsing of the container neck during capping and also permit prying the reclosure cap off the neck with less effort than heretofore. Prying a reclosure cap off may be of importance in the pharmaceutical industry where arthritis or other ailments inhibit the user from removing a prior art reclosure cap. The staggering of the top and bottom bead sections hereinafter described facilitates capping the cap without the danger of collapsing the container neck. The invention may be provided with a lengthening of the skirt of the cap and a lengthening of a vertical wall of the neck so that tight engagement of the interior of the skirt of the neck wall inhibits removal of the cap prior to tearing the skirt thereof by reason of the increased friction. In one embodiment of the invention, the skirt of the cap is elongated and the interior thereof fits with a friction fit against the exterior of an elongated vertical neck surface. This inhibits prying the cap off the container without tearing the neck. Further to prevent prying the cap off the neck, the flange which extends peripherally from the top of the cap is shaped and constructed in such manner that the fingernails cannot be used to pull the cap off prior to the skirt being torn. A shoulder is provided upon which the lower edge of the cap rests. To prevent a prying instrument being inserted under the lower edge of the skirt, the shoulder is made interrupted i.e. , protrusions separated by gaps, the width of the gaps being insufficient to permit the entry of the fingernails or a conventional prying instrument. The shoulder merges into a vertical surface which has a bumper ring series of interrupted protrusions. The bumper ring is used to grip the cap during filling, capping and loading into a container. Interrupting the bumper ring with straight sections gives strength to the neck to resist collapse when force is applied to seat the cap on the neck. Embodiments of the invention will now be disclosed by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings of which In Figures 1 4 is shown one form of container neck with which the present invention may be used. Neck 11, therefore, has a thin inward extending horizontal top flange 12 which terminates in a substantially vertical inner edge 13. Below edge 13 of flange 12 is a substantially horizontally outwardly extending surface 14 which terminates in a top internal groove 16. Below groove 16, the inside wall of the neck 11 slants downwardly outwardly in a surface 17 terminating in a vertical wall 18. Below wall 18 is a second internal groove 21 and below the groove 21 is another vertical wall 23 which terminates in an outwardly downwardly slanted wall 24 which, in turn, terminates in an internal vertical wall 25. The internal structure of the neck 11 is subject to considerable variation. Directing attention next to the exterior of the neck 11, the top corner 26 where flange 12 originates is slightly rounded and merges into top external vertical wall 27. There is a slightly inwardly directed shoulder 28 at the lower edge of wall 27 which continues inward and merges into groove 29 which is of lesser diameter than wall 27. Below groove 29 is a downwardly outwardly slanted wall 31 which comprises the top surface of external locking bead 32. The lower edge of bead 32 comprises a shoulder 33. Below shoulder 33 is a second external vertical wall 34 which is of lesser diameter than groove 29. Below wall 34 is an outward slanted wall 36 which terminates in third external elongated vertical wall 37 which has a diameter greater than wall 27. At the bottom of surface 37 is an interrupted shoulder 41. Said shoulder 41 consists of a plurality of circumferentially spaced protrusions 42, the outer edges 43 of which are rounded, separated by gaps 44. The width of the gaps 44 are insufficient to permit the fingernails or a prying instrument from being inserted under the lower edge 67 of the cap skirt 54 to pry the skirt off prior to tearing thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the protuberances 42 extend outwardly approximately .065 inches 1.65mm and are of a height approximately .037 inches 0.94mm for a shoulder area where the outside diameter of the protuberances is 1.500 inches 38.1mm . Shoulder 41 merges with a short vertical 46, which is provided with interrupted bumper ring 47. As illustrated, there are four circumferentially spaced apart outward bulging bumper ring sections 48 having approximately semicircular cross section inner and outer surfaces. The areas 49 between the outward bulging sections provide strength resisting collapse of the bumper ring during application of pressure during the seating of the cap 51 on the neck 11. The bumper ring 47 is used in certain types of filling, capping and loading equipment whereby grippers lift a container and deposit it in a box pallet. The bumper ring 47 also prevents the grippers from contacting the cap 51 and thus reduce the chance of the cap being pulled off the neck. The shape of the exterior as well as the interior of the neck 11 are subject to variation. Directing attention now to cap 51, again the structure of the cap is subject to variation and in its general principles resembles the commercially highly successful cap of assignee s license. In the preferred embodiment shown in Figure 1, cap 51 has a preferably flat top disc 52 on which a label or printed matter may be applied. The bottom 53 of disc 52 is also preferably flat. Depending from disc 52 is a cap skirt 50 having an external wall 54. In the preferred embodiment of the wall 54, the surface is smooth and substantially vertical and is elongated. The inside surface of the cap skirt 50 has a top internal vertical wall 56. Top locking bead means 57 are provided on the interior of the skirt 50 below the wall 56 positioned to lock under the shoulder 28 in the assembled condition of the cap and the neck. Upper bead means 57 may be continuous see Figure 1A or, as shown in Figure 1, may be interrupted. The interrupted bead sections have substantially horizontal top surfaces 58 and downwardly slanted surfaces 59 which terminates slightly above scoreline 81. Second or lower bead sections 61 may be provided. Again, bead sections may be continuous as shown in the bead 61a in Figure 1A or interrupted as shown in Figure 1. The interrupted bead sections 61 of Figure 1 are longer than the upper sections 57. The top surface 63 is slanted downwardly inwardly at a fairly acute angle. The lower surface 64 slants downwardly outwardly. Below the bead sections 61 is a third vertical wall 66 which extends down to the bottom edge 67 of the skirt 50. At one location along the bottom edge 67 there is a depending tear tab 68 which may have gripper ridges 69 on its interior surface. Skirt wall 66 is elongated and fits tightly against surface 37, the friction between the two inhibiting pulling the cap 51 off the neck 11 until the skirt 50 is torn. The slanted surfaces 59 and 64 facilitate cap 51 sliding over corner 26 and surface 61 without splitting the skirt. In Figure 1 the upper bead 57, as well as the lower bead 61, are shown interrupted, thereby enabling the skirt to expand more readily than if a continuous bead were used. In Figure 1A, however, the beads 57a, 61a are continuous. Thinner continuous beads permit the cap to expand more readily than solid thick continuous beads. The continuous top bead 57a of Figure 1A is particularly advantageous since it tends to retain the foil disc 71 inside the cap during the interval between the time the seal 71 is inserted and the cap is applied to the container neck. This reduces the possibility of a cap being applied without any foil seal therein. Spaced between lower bead means 61 and upper bead means 58 is an internal scoreline 81. Extending upward from the bottom edge 67 of the cap 51 in immediate proximity to the tear tab 68 is a curved or slanted scoreline 82 which merges with the scoreline 81. The scoreline 82 curves upwardly and to the right from the left side of the tab 68. However, the line 82 might also curve upwardly and to the left of the right edge of the tab 68. A thickening 83 of the wall 54 adjacent line 82 prevents tearing off the tab 68, particularly if the user pulls the tab in the wrong direction. A particular feature and advantage of the present invention is that, prior to the cap 51 being applied to the neck 11, a foil sealing disc 71 of a commercially available type is applied to the underside 53 of the top cap disc 52, The bead sections 57 assist in keeping the disc 71 in place prior to the cap being installed. When the cap is installed, as best shown in Figure 2, the seal 71 seats on the flange 12. Rounded outer edge 72 fits over the rounded corner 26. Adhesives or heating means cause the disc 71 to adhere to the flange 12. If an attempt is made to tamper with the contents of the container, such tampering can usually be detected by examination of the condition of the disc 71. As shown in Figure 1, a horizontal peripheral flange 86 projects out from the disc 52 at the upper end of the wall 54. The underside 87 slants upwardly outwardly at an angle of about 45 An additional tamper resistant feature is shown in Figure 2. Thus, the bottom edge 67 of the 50 skirt of the cap fits tightly against the shoulder 41. It is difficult, or impossible, for one to get one s fingernails under the edge 67 to pry the cap off while the skirt is intact. In the region where the tear tab 68 extends down below the lower edge 67, the cap flexes sufficiently so that the tab bends outwardly. It is relatively easy for the patron to grip the tear tab 68 when it extends outwardly away from the container neck. If the tear tab 68 were to lie flat against a vertical surface of the neck, then it would be necessary to pry the tab 68 outward either with the fingernails or an implement. Figures 5 10 are schematic views showing the interior of the cap skirt developed in a flat plane. In Figure 5, both the upper beads and lower beads are interrupted. The upper bead sections 57b are in line with the lower bead sections 61b and both sections are of approximately the same length, although it is preferable that the upper sections 57b be slightly shorter than the lower sections 61b. This construction facilitates stretching of the skirt 50b during capping action. The bead sections are elongated i.e., the upper bead sections 57b are considerably longer than the upper sections 57 of Figure 1. Another feature of Figure 5 is shown by dotted line 91. Although the scoreline 82b may curve upward to the left, alternatively the scoreline 82b may curve upwardly and to the right. Figure 1A shows the modification wherein both the upper bead sections 57a and the lower bead sections 58a, are continuous rather than interrupted as shown in Figures 1 and 5. It is preferable that the thickness of beads 57a and 61a be less than the beads 57 and 61 of Figure 1 to permit expansion of the skirt during the capping operation. Figure 6 shows a structure similar to Figure 5, except that the upper bead consists of a plurality of small upper bead sections 57c grouped with gaps therebetween, which gaps coincide with the gaps between the lower bead sections 61c. Thus, there may be three or more or less short upper bead sections 57c, the total length of which approximates the length of a lower bead section 61c and the gaps 93 between groups of upper bead sections is approximately equal to the gaps 94 between lower bead sections. Figure 7 is a further modification of the structure of Figure 5, wherein, instead of the upper and lower bead sections being in line, as in Figure 5, the upper bead sections 57d are staggered relative to the lower bead sections 61d. The staggering of the sections prevents the cap from splitting if such a tendency develops because a vertical splitting of the cap will be prevented either by the lower bead sections 61d or, if it occurs in the gap between lower bead sections, by the upper bead section 57d immediately thereabove. Figure 8 is a further modification of the structures of Figures 5 and 7 wherein the upper bead 96 is continuous and thin and the lower bead is interrupted in sections separated by gaps. This structure has the advantage of Figure 7 in stopping splitting of the skirt, but has the additional advantage of the uninterrupted upper bead of Figure 1A. Figure 9 shows short interrupted upper bead sections 57f separated by relatively long gaps 93f and short lower bead sections 61f which are somewhat longer than the upper bead section, but comparatively shorter than the lower bead sections of Figures 1 and 5 8. In Figure 9, the upper and lower bead sections 57f, 61f are vertically aligned. In Figure 10, the upper bead sections 57g are shown staggered relative to lower bead sections 61g to achieve the advantage of the staggered sections of Figure 7. In the modifications heretofore illustrated and described, the cap 51 is intended for use with a neck 11 which is closed by a foil or other seal 71, a structure particularly useful in packaging pharmaceuticals, such as tablets. The foil seal 71 may be inspected by the user to determine whether there has been tampering with the contents. However, in many usages, a seal 71 is unnecessary. In such usages, an inner skirt such as that shown in U.S. Patents 3,338,446, 4,202,455 and several other patents of the assignee of this application may be used, the outer wall of the inner skirt 98 sealing against the surfaces 13, 18, and 23 of the inner wall of the container neck 11. Thus, as shown in Figure 11, the cap 51h is similar to the cap of Figure 1, except that the foil seal 71 is eliminated and an inner skirt 98 having an outer surface 99 dimensioned to fit tightly against surfaces 13, 18 and 23 as provided. Preferably, the lower edge 100 of the inner skirt 98 is tapered to facilitate capping. Any of the bead constructions shown in Figures 1, 1A and 5 to 9, inclusive, may be used with a cap having inner skirt 98. In many respects the structures of Figures 1, 1A and 5 to 10 resemble each other and the same reference numerals followed by subscripts a to h, respectively, designate corresponding parts.
