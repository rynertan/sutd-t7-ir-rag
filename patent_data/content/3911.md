# Extraction of thaumatin.

## Abstract
A process for the extraction of thaumatin from the fruit of T. daniellii, comprises the steps of skinning the fruit, drying the pulp and mechanically separating the arils from the remainder of the fruit, powdering or otherwise comminuting the dried aril and extracting the resultant powder with water in the absence of added salts while maintaining the pH in the range 2.0 to 4.5. The drying of the skinned fruit is advantageously a freeze drying process.
