# Electromagnetic pickup cartridge.

## Abstract
A stereophonic electromagnetic pickup cartridge in which each of the right and left channel yokes is formed by folding a thin strip of a magnetic material over itself many times like pleats into a U shape coils 6 are mount ed on the yokes the bases of the yokes are crossed so that the bases of the yokes are respectively disposed along the lines which are crossed by 90 respectively with the axes of the maximum sensitivity of the right and left channels are formed and an armature is disposed at the open ends of the yokes. Mass production at less costs of high quality yokes with minimum eddy current loss becomes possible.
