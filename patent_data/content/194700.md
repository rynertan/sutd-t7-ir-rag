# ALUMINUM ALLOYS

## Abstract
A process for improving the properties of low density aluminum alloys comprises a controlled heat and cooling treatment of a shaped alloy to obtain a product which in the non aged condition has improved fracture toughness with out sacrificing tensile properties. The product is particularly useful for treating forged Al Li Mg alloys.
