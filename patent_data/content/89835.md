An apparatus for combining and weighing out articles includes a base 100 the top surface whereof is quadrangu lar in shape, and a plurality of weighing hoppers 305 provided on the base side by side horizontally along a substantially straight line. Also provided on the base 100 are weighing mechanisms for measuring the weights of articles introduced in corresponding weighing hoppers 305 , a hopper drive mechanism 400 for obtaining a combination of the articles giving a total weight closest to a target weight and for actuating prescribed ones of the weighing hoppers 305 , a chute 307 for receiving articles discharged from each of the weighing hoppers 305 , and a collecting hopper 500 provided for collecting the articles from the chute 307 . At least the weighing hoppers 305 , chute 307 and collecting hopper 500 are disposed at the front of the base 100 . The weighing apparatus is ideal for use in combination with others of the same construction.
