# Ion Source.

## Abstract
An ion source equipped with an ion beam exit slit 7 for extracting ions from plasma generated in feed gas introduced into a discharge chamber 5 , and with a gas inlet or inlets 110 for introducing the feed gas into the discharge chamber 5 in the proximity of the ion beam exit slit 7 . Ion extraction can be made stably without any deposit on the ion beam exit slit 7 even when a boron halide is used as the feed gas. The effect of the ion source can be further enhanced by adding oxygen, hydrogen or gas of an oxygen containing compound to the feed gas, and by using a microwave.
