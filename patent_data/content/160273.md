# Image forming apparatus.

## Abstract
An image forming apparatus comprises a rotatable, drum shaped photosensitive member 7 carrying thereon a latent image responsive to an origianl image, a first develop ing roller 50 adapted to supply a first developing agent 56a to the photosensitive member 7 while rotating, thereby developing the latent image, second developing roller 51 adapted to supply the second developing agent 56a to the photosensitive member 7 while rotating, thereby developing the laten image and a first and second motor assembly 27, 87 for rotating the photosensitive member 7 and selectively rotating the first and second developing rollers 50, 51 to move the photosensitive member 7 relatively to the first developing roller 50 at a first relative speed when the first developing roller 50 is rotated and to move the photosensitive member 7 relative ly to the second developing roller 51 at a second relative speed different from the first relative speed when the second developing roller 51 is rotated.
