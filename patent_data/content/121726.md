# MULTI PORT MEMORY CELL AND SYSTEM

## Abstract
A memory cell for storage arrays, e.g. register stacks, which comprises a plurality of write 28, 29 and read 30, 31, 32 transistors coupled to a single storage cell 35 or its output amplifier 33 , respectively. Each of the write and read transistors is separately selectable by an address decode signal on a respective control line 17A, 18A, 19A, 20A, 21A . Each of the write transistors 28, 29 is connected to an associated write head 12, 13 , and each of the read transistors 30, 31, 32 is connected to a respective read head 14, 15, 16 . Thus, the cell can be written and read within one cycle, and also multiple simultaneous read outs are possible.
