## Description
METHOD FOR SELECTIVE DETERMINATION OF CONJUGATED OR UNCONJUGATED BILIRUBIN In human body fluids such as bile and serum, bilirubin exists in two different forms, these forms commonly being referred to in the clinical literature as conjugated bilirubin, Bc, and unconjugated bilirubin, Bu. The total bilirubin content, BT, represents the sum of Bu and Bc Unconjugated bilirubin has a wellestablished molecular structure and constitutes the predominant portion o the total bilirubin content. For example, in normal human adult serum Bu constitutes about 80 percent Dy weight of the total bilirubin content thereof.The molecular weight of Bu is 584 and its molecular structure is as follows EMI1.1 Bc, believed to represent about 1 to 20 wt percent of the total bilirubin present in normal adult serum, is quite unstable in pure form and extremely difficult to isolate. Extensive study and research effort has been conducted to isolate this bilirubin component and to determine its molecular structure. Be has traditionally been considered to represent the reaction product of Bu esterified with sugar groups. However, owing to its instability, the specific molecular structure of a conjugated form of bilirubin had not been established until quite recently when it was separated from human bile and, for the first time, its molecular structure was determined by the present inventor with the aid of co workers. See paper entitled Human Conjugated Bilirubin Isolation,Biosynthesis And Molecular CharacterizationBy Direct Spectroscopic AnaLyses, T. W. Wu, et al., presented at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry 31st Annual Meeting inNew Orleans, Louisiana, July 15 20, 1979. An abstract of this paper appears in ClinicalChemistry, Vol. 25, No. 6, p. 1137, June, 1979.Even more recently, the present inventor has isolated and identified small amounts of a substance having this same molecular structure in human serum. This conjugated form of bilirubin, which has now been identified in both bile and serum, has been determined to have a molecular weight of 918.2 and a molecular structure as follows EMI2.1 where R1 glucuronic acid and R2 glucuronolactone or R1 glucuronolactor.e and R2 glucuronic acid. The diagnostic significance of bilirubin is well established. For example, an excessive amount of bilirubin within the human body, referred to as jaundice, is recognized as evidence of a variety of disease conditions, particularly diseases of the liver. In addition, in certain pathological conditions, for example, obstructive Jaundice, the small amount of B c normally present in adult human serum becomes elevated to form a larger proportion of the total bilirubin content. Thus, to facilitate early diagnosis of certain disease states, a bilirubin analysis that selectively determines the presence and or concentration of both B0 and Bu, as well as the total bilirubin content of human serum, would be highly useful. Prior to the present invention, to the knowledge of the inventor, no radiometric assay i.e., no assay based on detection of spectral absorption or emission was available for the selective determination of Bc and Bu Various assays are available which provide so called direct and indirect , as well as total bilirubin values.Some authors have claimed that direct bilirubin values can be equated with Bc, while the indirect values correspond to Bu However, as observed by Henry, Cannon, and Winkelman in Clinical Chemistry, Principles And Technics,Harper and Row, p. 1045 1974 , direct bilirubin samples have been found to includeBe components, such as bilirubin diglucuronide, as well as Bu Thus, one cannot simply equate direct or indirect bilirubin values with either the conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin components of a biological liquid. Furthermore, some believe that direct and indirect bilirubin have the same absorption spectra in serum. See Henry et al. referenced above at pp. 1071 and 1072.Based on this view, one would not expect that the different forms of bilirubin could be spectrophotometrically differentiated in a radiometric assay. Prior to the present invention, radiometric assays for bilirubin, such as colorimetric and fluorimetric assays, measured an absorption or emission spectrum of bilirubin or a bilirubin reaction product and determined final bilirubin concentration values essentially on the basis that the total bilirubin present in an unknown sample was predominantely in the form of Bu. For example, a colorimetric assay can be conducted by i detecting the absorbance, A, of an unknown bilirubincontaining sample ii applying Beer s Law III.A C C L where A represents absorbance, C represents molar absorptivity of bilirubin or a bilirubin reaction product, C represents bilirubin concentration in moles liter, and L represents pathlength and iii comparing the detected value of A to a calibration curve based on known amounts of Bu whereby the molar concentration, C, of bilirubin in an unknown sample can be determined.The resultant molar concentration, C, is then converted to an absolute amount, such as mg dl, using the molecular weight of Bu These radiometric assays for bilirubin fail to account for the presence of B c and essentially ignore its contribution to the absorption and or emission spectra of an unknown bilirubin containi.ng sample. To the extent that normal adult serum is composed predominantly of Bu, the foregoing failure poses no real problem. However, in those cases where the concentration of B is elevated 0 so that it represents a larger than normal proportion of the total bilirubin content, the foregoing failure of known radiometric assays for bilirubin leads to serious assay error.Moreover, prior to the present invention, in the absence of molecular weight and spectral absorption and or emission data on Bc, the foregoing radiometric assay errors were difficult, if not impossible, to prevent. Recen tly, U.S. Patent 4,069,C17, British Application 1673 78 and Research Disclosure, Volume 175, Iten 17554November 1978, have described a new colorimetric and a new fluorimetric assay, respectively, for the determination of bilirubin. These new assays employ interactive mordants for bilirubin. The mordanted bilirubin, as described in U.S. 4,069,017, facilitates the colorimetric detection of bilirubin in an aqueous liquid sample owing to the marked increase in the molar extinction coefficient exhibited by the mordanted bilirubin compared to that of free bilirubin and by the shift in absorption peak of the mordanted bilirubin compared to that exhibited by free bilirubin admixed in an aqueous liquid. The mordanted bilirubin, as described in the Research Disclosure article, has also been found to exhibit a marked increase in fluorescence intensity, compared to unmordanted bilirubin, and therefore one can also determine the presence and or concentration of bilirubin fluorimetrically by use of the mordanted bilirubin. The method of the present invention comprises radiometrically detecting the absorption or emission spectra of the aqueous liquid at two or more wavelengths, the respective molar absorption or emission characteristics of both Bu and B0 being known for at least two of these wavelengths, thereby facilitating evaluation of either the Bu or Be content, as well as the BT content, of the liquid. The method of the invention can be carried out using either absorption photometry, e.g., colorimetric detection, or emission photometry, e.g., fluorimetric detection, as an appropriate mode of radiometric detection.However, in the case of emission photometry, the interactive mordants for bilirubin, described in greater detail hereinafter, are required. In the case of absorption photometry, the interactive mordants, although preferred, are not required. In a preferred embodiment, a radiometric method is provided for the selective determination of the Bu and B c components of an aqueous liquid sample by use of an interactive mordant for bilirubin, the mordant having binding sites for bilirubin and comprising at least one moiety having a hydrophobic organic matrix containing a charge bearing cat ionic group. In this embodiment, the interactive mordant, upon mordanting B c and Bu, has been discovered to enhance the molar absorptivities of Bu and Bc, shift the absorption maximum of Bu, and produce fluorescence emission of Bu and Bc, thereby permitting the selective radiometric detection of both Bu and B .In those embodiments of the invention which employ an absorption detection mode, the mordanted B0 and mordanted B exhibit an increase in their molar extinction coefficients compared to those exhibited by unmordanted B u and Bc, and in the case of Bu, the mordantedBu also exhibits a shift in its absorption maximum compared to unmordanted Bu In those embodiments which employ an emission detection mode, each of the mordanted Bu and Bc, upon being subjected to activating radiation effective to excite the mordanted B0 or B exhibits a characteristic detectable fluorescence emission at a wavelength at which neither the unmordanted bilirubin components i.e., Bc and Bu , nor the interactive mordant, otherwise exhibits detectable fluorescence. In a preferred absorption detection mode of the invention, an aqueous liquid sample containing Bu and B0 is contacted with an interactive mordant composition for bilirubin.The method comprises the novel step of spectrophotometrically differentiating the mordanted B0 from the mordanted B by detecting two absorption wavelengths, one wavelength corresponding to an absorption maximum of mordanted B and one wavelength corresponding to an absorption maximum of mordanted Bc, the molar extinction coefficient of both mordanted B0 and B being known at each of the aforemen u tioned maxima.More specifically, this preferred method comprises the following steps a contacting the aqueous liquid with an interactive mordant for bilirubin, the bilirubin mordanted thereby exhibiting a spectrophotometrically detectable absorption spectrum containing the individual absorption bands characteristic of each of the Bu and B c components in the aqueous liquid, and b spectrophotometrically detecting the absorption spectra of the aqueous liquid at two or more wavelengths, one wavelength corresponding to an absorption maximum of mordanted Bu and one wavelength corresponding to an absorption maximum of mordanted Bc, the molar extinction coefficients of both mordanted B c and Bu being known at each of the aforementioned maxima. The assay method of the invention can advantageously provide several different bilirubin assay values. One can directly determine the presence and or concentration of both Bu and Bc. In addition, by adding together the amounts of these two different bilirubin components, one can also obtain a highly quantitative BT assay value. Thus, by interacting a single sample of the aqueous liquid to be assayed with a single amount of the interactive mordant, one can conveniently obtain a quantitative determination of Bu, Bc, and BT. In another embodiment, the analysis method of the invention is accomplished using an emission detection mode, e.g., fluorimetry, together with the interactive mordants described in greater detail hereinafter. This embodiment comprises the following stepsa bringing into contact an interactive mordant and an aqueous liquid containing B0 and Bu b thereafter, or during step a , subjecting the B0 and Bu mordanted thereby to activating radiation effective to excite the mordanted B0 and B and produce a detectable fluorescence emission spectrum containing individual emission bands characteristic of each of the mordanted B and B0 components in the aqueous liquid and c detecting the characteristic emission bands of the mordanted Be and B to provide a determination of the presence and or concentration of either the B0 or Bu, as well as the BT content, of the liquid sample. The method of the invention can be conveniently carried out using either wet chemistry or dry chemistry analytical techniques. Wet chemistry refers to analytical chemical techniques, sometimes termed solution assay techniques, wherein the assay is carried out in a liquid medium and the assay reagent s , which in this case would be the interactive mordant for bilirubin, is employed as a liquid reagent. Dry chemistry , on the other hand, refers to analytical chemical techniques wherein the assay reagent s is contained in a dry test element prepared, for example, by imbibing, impregnating, or coating the reagent s to form an essentially dry reagent zone. Dry chemistry test elements can include dip and read fibrous test strips or non fibrous, mult zone test elements such as the multilayer test elements described in U.S.Patents 3,992,158 and 4,069,017, In a preferred embodiment, the analysis method of the invention is carried out with a dry chemistry analytical element by a bringing into contact an aqueous liquid containing Be and Bu and an analytical element having an essentially dry reagent zone comprising an interactive mordant for bilirubin, the bilirubin mordanted thereby exhibiting an absorption or emission spectrum containing the individual absorption or emission bands characteristic of each of the mordanted Bu and Bc components and b radiometrically detecting the absorption or emission spectrum of the aqueous liquid at two or more wavelengths, the respective molar absorption or emission characteristics of both mordanted Bu and B0 being known for at least two of these wavelengths. In an especially preferred embodiment, the dry chemistry analytical element is a multi zone element comprising a reagent zone and a spreading zone which can effectively distribute and meter the aqueous test sample to the reagent zone. In this embodiment, such multi zone elements can be integral elements wherein the spreading zone and reagent zone are superposed layers in fluid contact with one another under conditions of use. Optionally, these layers can be carried on a suitable support, such as a radiationtransmissive support. The term radiation transmissive refers to zones, supports, and other layers of an element that permit effective passage of electromagnetic radiation used to detect an analytical result produced in the element.Typically, such radiation transmissive zones, supports, and other layers are transmissive of radiation having a wavelength within the region of from 200 to 800 nm, preferably 300 nm to 700 nm. It may also be desirable to have a support that transmits one or more narrow wavelength bands and is opaque to adjacent wavelength bands. This could be accomplished, for example, by impregnating or coating the support with one or more colorants having suitable absorption characteristics. As mentioned above, the lack of information as to B0 has lead to a serious source of assay error in conventional radiometric bilirubin assays. Specifically, as shown in attached Figs. 1 and 2, the absorption spectrum of Bu, whether mordanted or unmordanted, has been found to exhibit significant overlap with the absorption spectrum of mordanted or unmordanted Bc. Accordingly, when, for example, the absorption maximum of Bu at 435 440 nm is detected, a spectral absorption component of B0 is also being detected and must be properly accounted for, otherwise, the assay will be in error.To properly account for the B0 spectral absorption component, for example, at 435 440 nm, one must have information regarding the molecular weight and molar absorption characteristics of B c at this wavelength. The need for information regardingBe can be demonstrated, as follows, for the case of direct radiometric assays based on an absorption detection mode, e.g., colorimetric assays That is, as set forth above, colorimetric assays are based on Beer s law. In the case of bilirubin containing aqueous liquids including both Bc and Bu, the total detected absorbance, AT, at a given wavelength, , necessarily includes the contribution of each of Bu and Bc.Thus,IV AT at 1 A 1 due to Bu A 1 due to Bc which can be rewritten In accordance with Beer s Law asEMI12.1 Because L, the pathlength, is common to all aqueous liquids in a given measuring device, 1. 1VI L K constant, and Bu Bu 1. 1VII K constant.Bc Bc Thus, equation V can be rewritten asEMI12.2 To solve equation VIII to obtain the concentrations of CBu and CBc, one must necessarily know the molar absorption characteristics for each of Bu and B0 to 1 1 determine the constants, K and K.In addition, Bu Bc because equation VIII still contains two unknowns, namely CBu and CBcs to determine CBu and CBc for a given aqueous liquid by detecting AT at a given wavelength, one must necessarily detect AT at two different wavelengths, 1 and 2, thereby providing two simultaneous equations as follows EMI13.1 Equations IX and X can readily be evaluated for exact concentrations of CBu and CBc by detecting AT at two different wavelengths, provided the 1 1 2 2 respective absorption constants K, K, K and KBu Bc Bu Bc are known at each of A1 and .Once the molar concentrations, 0Bu and CBc, are evaluated, the absolute concentration of B and B0 in the aqueous liquid can be evaluated by employing the molecular weight of Bu and B0 as follows XI Bu CBu . Mol WtBu . Vol. of LiquidXII Bc CBc . Mol WtBc . Vol. of Liquid In light of the foregoing discussion, it will be appreciated that the assay method of the present invention can readily be carried out by radiometrically detecting the absorption spectra of an aqueous liquid at two different wavelengths, provided the respective molar absorption characteristics of Bu and B0 are known at the wavelengths and the molecular weights of B and Bc are also known.In a preferred embodiment wherein an interactive mordant for bilirubin is employed, the mordant has been found to enhance the absorptivity of both B and Bc, as described u in detail hereinafter, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the assay method. The pil and temperature conditions under which the present assay can be carried out can vary considerably. In a preferred embodiment, the assay is carried out at a pH range of from 6.8 to 9.5, preferably 6.8 to 7.6, and at a temperature within the range of from 150 to 600C, preferably from 220 to 500 C. In those embodiments of the assay which employ an interactive mordant, one can vary the pH and temperature to values above or below the stated ranges depending upon the particular mordant selected, provided, of course, one does not use a pH or temperature which causes undesired side reactions or significant degradation of bilirubin. To aid in maintaining the pH within the stated range of from 6.8 to 9.5, the bilirubin determination can be carried out in the presence of buffer. Various buffers can be used such as those described by Good inBiochemistry, 5, 1467 1966 . Particularly good results have been obtained using phosphate buffers, such as potassium phosphate. In the method of the invention, bilirubin effectors , or promoters as they are sometimes called, can be added during the assay. These effectors can be employed with or without the use of the interactive mordants. SeeHenry et al, Clinical Chemistry, Principles and Technics at pages 1047 and 1048. A partial listing of representative effectors includes caffeine, sodium benzoate, gum arabic, salicylate, and bile salts. A combiMation of caffeine and sodium benzoate has been found especially useful in the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the present method, the aqueous liquid containingBu and B0 is brought into contact, under the aforementioned ptI and temperature conditions, with an interactive mordant for the B0 and and and the absorption spectrum or emission spectrum of the liquid containing these two different mordanted bilirubin components is detected at at least two wavelengths. The spectrum detected at each wavelength is actually a composite spectrum representing the sum of the individual mordanted B and mordanted Be spectra as discussed above.In this embodiment the molar absorptivity of mordanted Bu and B0 is significantly enhanced, the absorption maximum of mordanted B is shifted, and fluorescence emission of mordanted B and mordanted B0 is produced, thereby facilitating the selective detection of these two bilirubin components. The radiometric detection of the absorption or emission bands characteristic of the mordanted bilirubin components can be carried out by well known absorption or emission detection devices and techniques.The detection of these spectral bands can be carried out at a predetermined time after the aqueous sample is brought into contact with the interactive mordant so that the resultant spectral data can readily be correlated to, for example, a calibration curve based on the spectral data obtained from a series of aqueous liquid controls containing known amounts of B u and B as determined at the u c same or a related predetermined time interval. The absorption and emission bands of the mordanted bilirubin components can vary somewhat depending upon the specific interactive mordant selected. In an absorption detection mode of the invention employing preferred interactive mordant copolymers, as described in detail hereinafter and in Figs.1 and 2, the following spectral absorption bands can be used to selectively detect the presence of mordanted Bu and B0 components An absorption maximum corresponding to the mordanted Be using preferred mordants typically occurs at or about 420 430 nm, while unmordanted Be exhibits a broad absorption maximum from about 420 to 460 nm. UnmordantedBu in the presence of an aqueous liquid at a pH of about 7.4 and a temperature of about 370C typically exhibits a broad absorption band extending from 400 to 470 nm with maximum absorption at or near 435 to 440 nm.An absorption maximum corresponding to the mordanted Bu again using preferred mordants is typically shifted by at least 10 nm from that of the unmordanted form of Bu. Thus, the absorption maximum corresponding to the mordanted B u occurs at or beyond 445 nm, usually at or near 460 nm. To avoid spectral interference from potential interferents which may be present in the aqueous sample, e.g., hemoglobin in the case of serum samples, any of the above noted absorptions can be detected off peak. Such off peak detection can generally be carried out at wavelengths up to 20 nm from the above stated values.Thus, as used herein, detecting at a wavelength at or near an absorption maximum means at the peak wve3.ength 20 nm. In the aforementioned absorption detection mode, the molar extinctIon coefficients of Bu and Bc, upon mordantng, may exhibit at least a 50 percent increase in comparison to the molar extinction coefficient of the same components unmordanted, as measured at the absorption peak of the mordanted component.Thus, as noted above, use of the interactive mordants in the present invention provides a significant enhancement of the absorption maxima of bilirubin, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the assay. In the emission detection mode, after the liquid sample is brought into contact with the interactive mordant, the mordanted bilirubin is subjected to activating radiation effective to excite and produce fluorescence emission of the mordanted bilirubin.Activating radiation effective to produce such fluorescence can vary somewhat depending upon the particular interactive mordant selected for use. In general, useful activating radiation effective to excite the mordantedBu and mordanted B0 corresponds to the characteristic absorption wavelengths of these unmordanted bilirubin components. In a preferred embodiment, excitation radiation at the absorption wavelength of B0 has been found effective to produce fluorescence emission of the mordanted Be at a wavelength within the range of 506 520 nm and excitation radiation at the absorption wavelength of Bu has been found effective to produce fluorescence emission of the mordantedBu at a wavelength within the range of 500510 nm.The peak wavelength of the fluorescence emission of mordanted Bc or Bu may also vary somewhat from the ranges noted hereinabove, depending upon the particular interactive mordant selected. Knowing the fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of the mordanted B0 and Bu, one can determine the concentration of B0 and or Bu present in an unknown bilirubincontaining sample in a manner analogous to that described above for the absorption detection mode. That is, one can excite a sample containing an unknown mixture of.mordanted Be and mordanted Bu at the excitation wavelength of B0 and detect the fluorescence emission of mordanted B0 at 506 520 nm, and then excite the same sample at the excitation wavelength of Bu and measure the fluorescence emission of mordanted B u at 500 510 nm. The measured fluorescence emission, for example, relative fluorescence intensity values, can be converted to percent absorptance fluorescence intensity being proportional to percent absorptance and percent absorptance values can, in turn, be converted to absorbance values percent absorptance being a function of absorbance . Once absorbance values are determined at two wavelengths from the fluorescence intensities measured at the fluorescence emission maxima of mordanted B0 and that of mordanted Bu, the absolute concentration s of B0 and or Bu in the unknown mixture is obtained through use of simultaneous equationsIX and X above. The fluorescence emission characteristics of the product formed by Bu or B0 and the mordants appear to be formed solely by this product. Neither B0 nor Bu alone, nor the mordants alone, exhibit fluorescence emission in the 480 to 520 nm range when subjected to appropriate excitation radiation. The mordants employed in the method of the invention correspond to those described in U.S. Patent 4,069,017. In general, these mordants have multiple binding sites for bilirubin and comprise at least one moiety having a hydrophobic organic matrix and a chargebearing cationic group. Such mordants can be monomeric or polymeric, with especially preferred embodiments of such mordants represented by homopolymers or copolymers containing repeating units having the above defined properties. Materials having these properties and compositions bind both B and B and 0 therefore these materials function as mordants for these bilirubin components. The chargebearing cationic group present in the mordant typically retains its cationic charge in an aqueous environment regardless of pH fluctuations. The charge properties of the cationic group in the interactive mordant are therefore insensitive to variations in pH. Especially preferred polymeric interactive mordants have in their polymer chain monomeric units of Formula XIII below EMI19.1 wherein A represents an organic group and constitutes a portion of a polymer backbone n is O or 1 Q represents a group linking M to A M represents a hydrophobic organic moiety containing a cation, preferably a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium group and represents an acid anion such as a halide ion, for example, chloride or bromide nitrate methosulfate or p toluenesulfonate. In certain especially useful embodiments, represents a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium group having Formulas XIV or XV below EMI20.1 wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 which may be the same or different, represent an aryl, an aralkyl, or an alkaryl group having from 5 to 20 carbon atoms or an alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 10 carbon atoms. Preferably, Q, in Formula XIII represents a hydrocarbon group, preferably an arylene, arylenealkylene, alkylenearylene, arylenebisalkylene, or alkylenebisarylene group. Typically, although not required, Q contains from 5 to 10 carbon atoms. As will be appreciated, A in FormulaXIII above will vary depending upon the particular polymeric backbone selected for use. Especially good results, however, have been obtained when lEepresents an alkylene group. Typically, such alkylene groups contain from 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Copolymers particularly useful as interactive mordant S include copolymers containing recurrlng units having FormulaXIII hereinabove, and, in addition, up to 75 weight percent of additional non interfering repeating units. The term non interfering repeating units is used herein to include units which do not chemically or physically interfere with the above described mordanting of bilirubin.Monomers which provide such non interfering repeating units and which also impart hydrophobicity to the resultant mordant copolymer include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as olefins and substituted olefins and styrene and substituted styrenes alkylacrylates and methacrylates and derivatives thereof and known equivalents for such monomers. In addition if desired, difunctional cross linking groups can be introduced into such copolymers. A partial listing of individual representative interactive mordants useful in the method of the invention include the following materials. In the copolymers, the weight ratio of the two monomers entering into the polymerization reaction is 50 50, except for polymer 6 where it is 49.5 49.5 1. Table Name Structure 1.

The amount of the above descrjbed interactive mordants required in this method of bilirubin analysis can vary. Typically, in any given case, the amount of sucll interactive mordant will depend upon the particular range of bilirubin content, i.e., the dynamic range , over which a specific bilirubin assay is designed to be useful. In preferred embodiments wherein 1 mole cf bilirubin is bound or mordanted to an interactive mordant containing 1 molar equivalent amount of binding site for bilirubin, there should be sufficient interactive mordant to provide at least one molar equivalent of binding site for the maximum number of moles of bilirubin for which that assay is intended. The amount of the mordant required will depend upon the average number of binding sites for bilirubin and, as noted above the dynamic range over which a specific bilirubin assay which employs such mordant is designed to be useful. In a preferred embodiment, wherein a mordant, such as any one of polymeric mordants 1 6 listed above, is employed and wherein such polymeric mordant is prepared from an intermediate copolymer of styrene and vinylbenzyl chloride having an inherent viscosity as measured at 250C in benzene at a concentration of 0.25 g dl of about 0.15 to 0.1, one can employ an amount within the range of from 0.01 to 1.0 g dl of mordant to provide an assay having a dynamic range of 0.1 to 50 mg dl of bilirubin analyte. In general, it is useful to employ an excess amount of mordant in the bilirubin analysis method so that one can accelerate the interaction. When the present bilirubin analysis method is carried cut as a wet chemistry assay, analysis is conveniently performed by introduction of the aqueous liquid to be assayed into a suitable wet reaction zone, such as a radiation transmlssive container.In those embodiments which employ a mordant, an appropriate interactive mordant is also introduced into the reaction zone to contact the aqueous liquid to be assayed. The mordant can be added directly as a dry powder or in the form of a solution or dispersion containing the desired mordant admixed in a non interfering aqueous or organic liquid medium. The use of water is preferred. If desired one or more buffers is also introduced into the reaction zone to facilitate the performance of the assay in the preferred pH range of from 6.8 to 9.5. In the wet chemistry method, a preliminary step of treating the bilirubincontaining liquid test sample to dissociate the bilirubin from various materials to which it may be bound is desirable. For example, where the liquid test sample is serum, a large amount of the bilirubin is bound to serum protein, primarily albumin. Various techniques have been devised in the art and are well known for such dissociation. A review of many of these different procedures can be found, for example, in Winkelman et al, Clinical Chemi.stry Principles and Technics, 2nd Edition 1974 , pages 1042 i079. Following any optional preliminary treatment of the bilirubin containing test sample and bringing the test sample into contact with any optional components such as a mordant and buffer, the assay is carried out, preferably in the dark or under yellow safelight conditions, to avoid light induced degradation of bilirubin. In those embodiments which employ a mordant the assay mixture containing the test sample and mordant is incubated to effect the interaction of mordant and bilirubin. Thereafter, or during this step, the wet reaction zone containing the assay mixture is subjected to a suitable radiometric detection mode as described hereinabove. Where incubation is employed, its time period is quite short, on the order of seconds or minutes, usually within the range of from 1 second to 10 minutes, preferably 30 seconds to 7 minutes. If desired, stirring or mixing of the assay mixture can be carried out during the incubation to facilitate the interaction of the bilirubin and the mordant. Because of handling ease and overall convenience as well as the capability of providing quantitative analytical results, the selective analysis of Bu and Bc by use of a dry chemistry analytical element is especially preferred. Such an element comprises an essentially dry i.e., dry to the touch reagent zone permeable to bilirubin and containing the interactive mordant, if one is employed. An essentially dry spreading zone and or additional zoneb can also be present in the analytical elements. A preferred element of the invention typically comprises at least two distinct zones which are in fluid contact with one another under conditions of use.Fluid contact has reference to the ability of a liquid to pass between distinct zones of an element, even though the zones may be separated by intervening zones or initially spaced apart. Other zones which can be present in the element if desired, include radiation blocking zones, subbing zones, and the like. Further description of radiation blocking zones and the term fluid contact can be found in U.S. Patent 4,069,017. Preferably, although not necessarily, the various zones are present in an element as superposed, contiguous layers. These layers can be carried on a support, preferably a radiation transmissive support. Although preferred analytical elements are composed of superposed, contiguous layers, other elements can be prepared and employed in the method of the invention having different structural arrangements such as an element having two adjacent abutting zones, namely a spreading zone and a reagent zone, both carried on a support if necessary or desired. Such an element is illustrated, for example, in Fig.2 of U.S. Patent 4,069,017. For convenience, the dry chemistry elements employed in the invention will hereinafter be described in terms of a multilayer, integral analytical element wherein the different zones are present as superposed, contiguous layers carried on a radiation tranmissive support. In one preferred embodiment, an integral analytical element employed in the practice of this invention comprises a radiationtransmissive support having thereon, 1 a reagent layer that is permeable to at least bilirubin and which optionally contains an interactive mordant for bilirubin and 2 a spreading layer that is permeable, preferably uniformly permeable, to bilirubin. The reagent layer is interposed between the support and the spreading layer. Preferably, the reagent layer is substantially impermeable to protein materials having a molecular weight substantially greater than that of bilirubin, e.g., albumin and other proteins having a molecular weight in the region of 60,000 dalton units or higher. In a further aspect of the foregoing preferred embodiment, the spreading layer is non fibrous and, desirably, isotropically porous. More preferably, all layers in the element are non fibrous, to enhance quantitative analytical capability. The term non fibrous is used herein with respect to layers and or materials to indicate that such layers or materials do not include fibrous components to a degree that would interfere with sample spreading or with detection of the analytical result by radiometric means. Useful spreading layers can be prepared using a variety of both fibrous and non fibrous components. Especially preferred spreading layers containing non fibrous components are more fully described in U.S.Patent 3,992,158. The thickness of the spreading layer is variable and will depend in part on the intended sample volume, which, for convenience and cleanliness, the spreading layer should be able to absorb, and on the void volume of the layer, which also affects the amount of sample that can be absorbed into the layer.Spreading layers in the range of from 60 microns to 300 microns dry thickness have been found particularly useful. However, thicknesses outside this range are acceptable and may be desirable for particular elements. Reagent layers employed in the dry chemistry elements include a matrix permeable to bilirubin in which the interactive mordant, if one is used, is dissolved or dispersed.However, because many of the interactive mordants are polymeric and may themselves be film forming or otherwise readily coat able as a uniform layer or zone, a separate matrix material is not always required when a mordant is employed. The choice of a matrix material is, of course, variable and dependent on the components such as optional mordant and buffer distributed therein. In any case, the matrix material should be non interfering with respect to any mordant contained therein, i.e., the matrix material should be incapable of itself binding or mordanting to the interactive mordant. Further detail regarding reagent layers useful herein may be found by reference to U.S. Patent 4,069,017. As is the case for the wet chemistry assay for bilirubin, one can also include in the dry chemistry analytical element an appropriate buffer. The buffer can be incorporated in the reagent layer or in one or more of the other layers in an amount effective to impart to the reagent layer, under conditions of use of the element, a pH essentially identical to that employed in a wet chemistry assay. In preparing the integral analytical elements, the layers can be preformed as separate layers which are laminated together prior to use or maintained as separate layers until brought into fluid contact when the element is in use. Detailed description of techniques for the preparation of these dry chemistry test elements can be found in U.S.Patents 3,992,158 and 4,069,017. In the layers of the element, it can be advantageous to incorporate one or more surfactants, e.g. anionic and nonionie surfactants. They can, for example, enhance coat ability of layer formulations and enhance the extent and rate of spreading in spreading layers that are not easily wetted by liquid samples. In particular, it can be desirable to incorporate a relatively large amount cf a surfactant, such as a nonionic surfactant, in the spreading layer to normalize transport of bilirubin contained in an aqueous proteinaceous liquid sample in and through this layer.Such normalization refers to obtaining within the spreading layer an equivalent penetration of the solvent medium and bilirubin contained in various applied samples of aqueous proteinaceous liquids, notwithstanding variations in protein concentration among such samples.In addition, it has been found that because bilirubin is often present in a bound state such as bound to other proteins, e.g., serum albumin, the use of such surfactants in the spreading layer to achieve normalization of bilirubin transport advantageously appears to dissociate bilruin bound to such protein.Preferred amounts of surfactant effective to achieve normalized bilirubin transport are between 1 and 15 by weight based on the dry weight of the layer. Further details regarding this use of surfactants to achieve normalized analyte transport may be found by reference to U.S. Patent 4,050,898. Other optional interlayers may also be present in integral analytical elements employed as dry chemistry test elements used in the inven tion. For instance, a separate interlayer swellable in the solvent or dispersion medium of the liquid sample under analysis can be used. Such a swellable interlayer, preferably radiation transmissive, e.g., a swellable gel layer, can be incorporated between the reagent layer and support of an integral analytical element and could be used to enhance the permeation or spread rate of a bilirubinlcontaining serum sample through the spreading layer into the reagent layer of the element. As another example an interlayer can be incorporated into an analytical element of the invention between the spreading layer and the reagent layer thereof.Such a layer should, of course, be permeable to bilirubin and can be used to incorporate reagent materials that can render various interferents for bilirubin inactive or can be used to filter and thereby remove such interferents. As can be appreciated, dry chemistry analytical elements useful in the present invention can be configured in a variety of forms, including elongated tapes of any desired widths, sheets or smaller chips. Preferred dry chemistry analytical elements are used by applying to the element a sample of liquid under analysis. The applied sample will normally contact the spreading layer prior to the reagent layer and at its surface farthest removed from such reagent layer. After sample application, and desirably after the liquid sample has been taken up by a spreading layer, the element is exposed to any conditioning, such as heating or humidification, that may be desirable to facilitate obtaining the test result. After the analytical result is obtained as a detectable change, it is measured, usually by passing the element through a zone in which suitable apparatus for reflection or transmission colorimetry or spectrofluorimetry is provided. In a colorimetric detection mode, such apparatus would serve to direct a beam of energy, such as light, through the support and the reagent layer. The light would then be reflected, such as from an opacifying agent in the spreading or radiation blocking layer in the element, back to a detecting means or would pass through the element to a detector. In a fluorimetric detection mode, such apparatus would serve to direct a beam of light through the support and the reagent layer to excite the mordanted bilirubin in the reagent layer and stimulate fluorescent emission of light radiation by the mordanted bilirubin. This fluorescence emission would then be reflected, such as from an opacifying agent in the spreading layer of the element, back to a detecting means or would pass through the element to a detector. Various calibration techniques can be used to provide a control for the analysis. As one example, a sample of analyte standard solution can be applied adjacent the area where the drop of sample is placed in order to permit the use of differential measurements in the analysis. The following Examples are presented to further illustrate the practice of the invention. The following procedures and materials were employed in the Examples Procedures 1. Simultaneous equations IX and X hereinabove were employed in the examples below to aid in the determination of the unknown concentrations of Bu and Bc in an aqueous liquid containing them. To use these equations, the following analysis was used Transmission density DT, was assumed to be approximately equal to absorbance, A, for the case of homogeneous thin films and solutions. Therefore, equations IX and X were rewritten as 1. 1.XVI DT at 1 K C K C and Bu Bu Bc Bc 2. 2.XVII DT at 2 K C K C Bu Bu Bc Bc Then, using Al 460 nm and 2 420 nm, equations XVI and XVII were rewritten as 460. 460.XVIII DT at 460 K C K C Bu Bu Bc Bc 420 420 XIX DT at 420 KBu CBu KBc CBcBy algebraic substitution and transformation, equationsXVIII and XIX can be rewritten as EMI35.1 2. In the case of multilayer analytical elements having a reflective layer, certain of the examples reported below measured optical density values in terms of reflection density, DR, rather than transmission density, DT.In these cases, DR values were converted to DT values by the following transformation EMI35.2 The use of the above noted transformation is applicable to the transformation of DR toDT values for the case of a thin film multilayer analytical element such as described below inMaterials, and is similar to the transformation of DR to DT values discussed by Williams andClapper, Multiple internal Reflections inPhotographic Color Prints , J. Opt. Soc. Am., Vol. 43, p. 595 1953 . The use of this transformation is also discussed in Curme et al, Nultilayer Film Elements for ClinicalAnalysis General Concepts , Clinical Chemistry,Vol. 24, p. 1335 at 1340 1978. 3. Aqueous solutions of Bc and described in the examples below were prepared by the method of J. I. Routh as set forth inFundamentals of Clinical Chemistry, Ed N.W. Tietz, W. B. Saunders Company, PhIladelphia, p. 1026 1031 1976 .Materials 1. Unconjugated bilirubin Bu was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. Conjugated bilirubin Bc prepared from bile was obtained by a modified Lucassen procedure Lucassen, The Diazo Reaction ofBilirubin and Bilirubin Diglucuronide ,Doctoral Thesis, University of Utrecht,Netherlands 1961 as described in the Wu et al paper referred to above. Conjugated bilirubin Bc prepared from human serum was obtained using an interactive mordant as follows First, a pool of serum having a high Bc concentration jaundiced sera having a total bilirubin concentration equal to or in excess of 20 mg dl, of which 70 80 appeared as direct bilirubin in a Jendrassik Grof assay was diluted 1 to 5 v v with distilled water under nitrogen.This solution was carefully titrated with mordant 4 of Table I made up to 1 fresh in water containing 510 methanol until the absorbance at 425 nm stopped increasing. With mild excess of mordant 4, the absorbance at 425 nm decreased slightly. The titrated solution appeared turbid and was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 15,000 x g at 0 40C. The yellowish mordanted pellet was gently resuspended in 3 volumes of 0.05 to 0.lN potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to which 1 Na2S203 had been added. To the cloudy suspension was added dropwise a fresh solution of caffeIne and sodium benzoate until the final level of caffeine was approximately 0.lem and that of benzoate 0.2M. Durin this time, the solution was stirred vigorously under nitrogen and in a bath of ice.The solution was allowed to stand for 1 2 hour in the dark and cold 040C , then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was saved. The pellet was washed at least twice with an equal volume of 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, then three to four times with a 1 1 v v mixture of 1M NaCl and n propanol.The washings were pooled with the supernatant from the preceding centrifugation, then stirred under nitrogen and in the dark for 1 2 hour. The solution was freeze dried the resultant powder was resuspended in a minimal amount of water and loaded on a column containingLH 20 gel beads purchased from Pharmacia,Uppsala, Sweden packed with 95 ethanol diluted 1 1 v v with O.lM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The same solvent mixture served as the eluting medium. The yellow eluted fractions were pooled, rechromatographed on a fresh column as before, and immediately freeze dried. The resulting brownish yellow powder contained concentrated Bc having a purity of about 85 based on quantitative NMR nuclear magnetic resonance and gravimetric analysis. 2. Human sera used in the following examples were supplied by local hospitals.Serum samples, if not used immediately, were kept frozen at 250C in the dark. If not used in one week, the samples were not used at all. Samples were not reused after thawing. 3. The mordants used were mordants 4 and 6 of Table I. 4. The thin film multilayer analytical element used in certain of the examples below had the following structure and composition Reflecting g m2 Spreading Layer TiO, 50.0 CafBeine 2.69 Sodium Benzoate 4.035 Octylphenoxypolyethoxy 1.4 ethanol surfactant Polyoxyethylene oleyl 0.9 ether surfactantSubbing Layer Poly N isopropylacrylamide 0.387Mordant Layer Mordant 1.72 Deionized gelatin 8.608 N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl 3.5 glycine buffer, 0.2M pH 8.0Support Layer Poly ethylene terephthalate 5. Other chemicals noted in the examples below were obtained from EastmanOrganic Chemicals, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N. Y. Unless otherwise specified, the chemicals used were reagent grade.Example 1 Determination of Molar Absorption Characteristics of Mordanted B and B0 in Multilayer Element In this example two series of bilirubin solutions were prepared, one series consisting of aqueous solutions of B0 from human bile at varying concentration levels and one series consisting of aqueous B u solutions at varying concentration levels.Each solution was then spotted onto a multilayer analytical element as described in Materials 4 above and the transmission density of each solution was measured at 460 nm and 420 nm using a common spectrophotometer. Plots ofDT VS. molar concentration of Bu were made for the one series of solutions at 460 nm and also at 420 nm plots of DT vs. molar concentration of Bc were made for the other series of solutions also at 460 nm and 420 nm. The slopes of these 4 plots were then evaluated, i.e. ADT divided by Amolar concentration, to obtain the molar absorption constant K K e.L from equation VI and VII above for Bc and Bu at 460 nm and 420 nm. Estimating the pathlength,L, in each of the multilayer test elements to be approximately equal to 0.0568 mm, the molar absorptivity, , for mordanted Bu and mordanted B0 was also determined at 460 and 420 nm. The results are shown below in Table II. Table II KBu Bu KBc Be nm mordant mordant mordant mordant 460 nm 500 88,ooo 236 41,536 420 nm 362 63,712 334 58,784 Eample 2 Simultaneous Determination of Bu and Be in Solution No Mordant Calibrator solutions were prepared as follows Varying amounts of B were dissolved in aqueous medium by the method of Procedure 3 above to obtain final B levels of approximately .5, 2, 5, and 10 mgidl. Varying amounts of freshly purified Bc obtained from human bile were dissolved in aqueous medium as described above to give final B c levels of approximately .5, 2, 5, and 10 mg dl. A third set of aqueous solutions was prepared by admixing equal volumes of each level of the Bu and Be calibrators noted above in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 . Water blanks were used throughout. The absorbance of each of the third set solutions noted above was read in aPerkin Elmer 576 spectrophotometer at 420 and 460 nm after having obtained the molar absorptivity values of B and Be using the abovenoted calibrator solutions. The reference method used was a gravimetric method. The basic equations used for the simultaneous calculations are those described in Procedure 1. Results are summarized in Table I and show that predicted values agreed closely with the reference values.

A small amount of Mordant 4 of TableI was then added to the specimen, and the absorption spectrum was again recorded. The sample alone displayed a broad spectrum with an apparent maximum in the vicinity of 420 to 460 nm, whereas, in the presence of theMordant 4, the sample became selectively amplified at 420 425 nm.This behavior resembled that previously observed with Bc obtained from other biological sources such as human bile. Results are shown in Figure 1.Example 4 Spectral Enhancement of B u in Presence of Mordant A sample of B u in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 was placed in a cuvette, and the absorption spectrum 360 600 nm was recorded on a spectrophotometer. A small amount ofMordant 6, Table I, was then added to the specimen, and the absorption spectrum was again recorded. The sample alone displayed a broad spectrum with apparent maximum in the vicinity of 435 440 nm whereas, in the presence of Mordant 6, the sample became selectively amplified at 460 nm, accompanied by a two fold increase in its absorption at the new peak. Results are shown in Fig. 2. Example 5 Quantitation of Bu and Bc in Multilayer Analytical Element With Mordant Calibrator solutions were prepared as follows varying amounts of Bu were dissolved in aliquots of pooled human serum to obtain final Bu levels as determined gravimetrically of approximately 1, 5, 10, and 20 mg dl. Similarly, freshly purifiedBc from human bile was diluted with aliquots of the same serum pool to give final Bc levels of approximately 1, 5, 10, and 20 mg dl. In addition, a third set of solutions with varying amounts of Bu and Bc from human bile was prepared in aliquots of the same serum pool. Each solution of the third set noted above was spotted on a separate multilayer analytical element each element having an identical formulatio as described in Materials 4 above , incubated for 5 minutes at 370C, after which the reflectance densities, DR, were measured at 420 nm and 460 nm for each spot. The analytical elements were calibrated with the above noted calibrator solutions to determine the constants KBU and KBC. Reflectance density values were converted to transmission density, DT, values as described in Procedure 2 above. The simultaneous equations shown in Procedure 1 above were then used to obtain the concentration of Bu and Bc in each of the third set solutions.Results comparing gravimetric values to the values determined by the multilayer analytical element are shown in Table IV. As shown in TableIV, good agreement between the values determined by the multilayer analytical element using the method of the invention and the gravimetric values was obtained.

The samples were then assayed by the method of the invention employing the multilayer analytical element described inMaterials 4 above using the technique described in Example 5 above. BT by the method of the present invention was obtained by adding together the measured values obtained for Bc and Bu The results are shown in Table V. As shown in Table V, B T values from JendrassikGrof agree fairly closely with BT values by the present method. Direct values by theJendrassik Grof assay differ from the Bc values of the present method because, among other reasons, direct values include someBu and because the direct values are calibrated with Bu alone.
