## Description
IMPROVED TRAILER FOR CONTAINERIZED LOADS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the trucking industry. More particularly the present invention relates to trailers for carrying containerized loads, wherein the containers are twenty feet or less in length.The invention provides a combination of trailer features that cooperate to overcome various problems encountered when transporting and handling containers of twenty feet or less in length.2. Description of the Prior Art Shipping containers are now the accepted standard for transferring large loads by land, sea, and air. Such containers are sealed at their point of origin and only opened at their destination, thus eliminating pilferage and vandalism. The containers are provided in different standard sizes. One problem that is frequently encountered when transporting smaller containers twenty feet or less in length on truck trailers is illustrated inFigs. 1A and 1B. To provide sufficient turning clearance for truck tractor rear wheels 17, trailer landing gear 12 must be moved toward the center of trailer 10 away from the truck tractor rear wheels. Generally, container 14 has an evenly distributed cargo and the trailer is thus balanced during transport. However, when trailer 14 is solely supported by landing gear 12 and container 14 is opened for loading or unloading, more weight necessarily is placed toward the front of the trailer because the rear portion of the container is emptied first. As a result, the front end of the trailer carries more of the container load than the rear end of the trailer, the balance of the trailer is disturbed, and the trailer tends to tip forward onto pavement P, as shown in Fig. 1A. To prevent such tipping, landing gear 12 could be located forward along the trailer axis to shift the center of gravity of the trailer and thus balance the container load. However, there is then insufficient clearance for the rear wheels 17 of truck tractor 16 when turning, as shown in Fig. 1B. One solution to the above problem provides a pair of pivotally mounted pipe like trailer legs. Such legs may be folded out of the way, parallel to the trailer when a load is transported and they may be dropped down perpendicular to the trailer to support the load when the truck tractor is removed from the trailer. Such folding legs are typically unstable and difficult to set in place during coupling or uncoupling of a truck tractor with the trailer. Failure of such prior art folding legs can result in injury to workers and damage to the equipment or the cargo. With regard to the transport of containerized loads in shipping containers of twenty feet or less in length, it is necessary to provide an even balance of the load. Most trailers adapted to carry such containers provide two rear axles, referred to as parallel or equalizer axles, each axle having four wheels. To pro perly transport the load, the weight of the container must be evenly distributed between the two axles of the rear wheels. In trailers designed to carry containers in excess of twenty feet in length, a cross brace is pro vided transverse to the trailer positioned between the axles and the container rests thereon. For containers of twenty feet or less in. length the same transverse cross brace arrangement must be used. This approach is adequate when a sealed container is loaded to or lifted from a trailer. However, such arrangement presents serious problems when loading or unloading an opened container while the container is on the trailer. A schematic illustration of a prior art trailer and container in combination is shown in Fig. 2, in which it can be seen that a gap between the rear of container 14 and a loading dock D is created by the rear portion and rear axle of trailer 10. That is, backing the trailer flush to the loading dock does not bring the rear portion of the container, which is supported on trailer cross brace 25 at a point between rear axles 31 and 33 to the edge of the dock. One solution to the problems of load balance and dock gap provides a trailer extension frame. The frame is extended to allow the trailer to accommodate longer containers the frame is retracted to allow the trailer to accommodate shorter containers twenty feet or less in length . Such extension frames are quite complex and must be constructed of heavy gauge materials to rigidly support a containerized load while cantilevered beyond the trailer rear wheels. Accordingly, such extension frames add considerable weight and cost to the trailer while reducing reliability and service ability SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved truck tractor trailer.The invention solves the problems of load balance, tipping, wheel clearance, and dock gap by providing two embodiments which may be practiced singly, or in combination. One embodiment of the invention provides slidable landing gear that are particularly useful for trailers adapted to carry cargo containers and, in particular, cargo containers of twenty feet or less. The above mentioned problems of trailer tipping and truck tractor rear wheel clearance are solved by a novel landing gear trailer support that is selectively slidable along a trailer axis between a trailer support position and a trailer transport position. That is, when a truck tractor is to be uncoupled from a load bearing trailer, the landing gear are slid forward along the trailer axis to a point sufficiently past trailer center to support the loaded trailer without it tipping. Once the landing gear are slid forward, conventional landing gear pads are extended to lift the loaded trailer from the truck tractor. The truck tractor is then driven from the trailer When a truck tractor is to be coupled to a load bearing trailer, the truck tractor is backed to the trailer. The landing gear pads are retracted to lower the trailer onto the truck tractor and couple it therewith. The landing gear are then slid rearward along the trailer axis to a point sufficiently away from the truck tractor rear wheels to allow for ample turning clearance therebetween. The trailer and container are securely supported against tipping when the truck tractor is removed therefrom by forward placement of the landing gear along the trailer axis. Likewise, ample truck tractor rear wheel clearance is provided by rearward placement of the landing gear rearward along the trailer axis. Landing gear movement may be accomplished by any known motive means, including electric, pneumatic, and hydraulic motors. One embodiment of the invention provides a trailer mounted rack and shaft driven pinion for moving a landing gear carriage along the trailer axis between the landing gear trailer supporting position and the landing gear trailer transporting position. Another embodiment of the invention addresses both the problems of load balance and wheel clearance, and that of loading and unloading a container of twenty feet or less directly at a loading dock. A sliding trailer cross brace is provided that extends transversely to the trailer along a top portion thereof and that is movable along the trailer axis. A rear portion of the container is supported by the cross brace. When the trailer is transported, the cross brace is slid forward to a first position between the two trailer rear axles to evenly distribute the load at the rear portion of the trailer. When a truck tractor is uncoupled from the trailer and the trailer supports a load on with its landing gear and rear wheels, or when docking a container to a loading dock, the transverse cross brace is slid rearwardly to a second position along the trailer axis, which also serves to move the container rearwardly.This obviates the problem of trailer tipping by shifting the load center of gravity rearward and, therefore, effectively shifting the landing gear forward past the load center The problem of loading and unloading at a dock is also obviated by the sliding cross brace because the rear portion of the container is flush with the rear portion of the trailer and thus is easily slid into a loading configuration with the dock. Such arrangement is particularly useful with an extensible trailer that allows the front supporting portion of the trailer to retract toward the rear of the trailer as the rear transverse cross brace is shifted rearwardly along the trailer. A sliding landing gear may be provided with this embodiment of the invention or it may be dispensed with by substituting a standard landing gear therefor.If standard landing gear are provided, they are positioned rear enough from the trailer fifth wheel pin to provide ample clearance fgr the truck tractor rear wheels during turning.

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED AND ALTERNATE EMBODIMENTS One embodiment of the present invention provides a sliding landing gear for a trailer of the type used to transport containers, particularly containers zof twenty feet or less in length. A side elevational schematic illustration of the present invention is provided by Figs. 3A 3D. A trailer 10a and container 14a combination is coupled to a truck tractor 16a at a fifth wheel coupling 15a Fig. 3k The combination is supported on pavement P by truck tractor wheels 17 and trailer wheels lla. A landing gear 18 is positioned along the axis of trailer 10a. A crank assembly 21 is included with landing gear 18 for raising and lowering a support pad 19.A brace 22 is provided to add strength and rigidity to the landing gear. When uncoupling the trailer from the truck tractor, e.g. to load or unload container 14a, landing gear assembly 18 is slid forward along the trailer axis to a point substantially in abutment with the rear portion of truck tractor 16a Fig. 3B . Support pad 19 is lowered by operating crank 21 to extend shaft 20 from landing gear 18 Fig. 3C . A trailer fifth wheel pin 13a is lifted from truck tractor fifth wheel coupling 15a. The truck tractor is then driven from the trailer Fig. 3D . To couple the truck tractor with the trailer to transport the container with the trailer, the above procedure is repeated in reverse. That is, tractor 16a is backed to the trailer Fig. 3D . Crank 21 is operated to retract shaft 20 within landing gear 18 and thereby lower trailer fifth wheel pin 13a to truck tractor fifth wheel coupling 15a Fig. 3C . When trailer 10a is coupled to truck tractor 16a Fig. 3B , landing gear 18 is moved rearwardly along the trailer axis to allow container 14a to be transported Fig. 3A . Thus, one embodiment of the invention provides a rigid landing gear that is operable in two selected positions 1 a transport position in which the landing gear is moved toward a rearward portion of the trailer and in which the landing gear pads are withdrawn into the landing gear Fig. 3A and 2 a support position in which the landing gear are moved forward along the axis of the trailer and in which the landing gear pads are lowered to support the trailer Fig. 3D . In the trailer transporting rearward landing gear position, truck tractor rear wheels 17a are provided with ample clearance to readily allow the truck tractor to turn as is necessary during trailer transport.In the trailer supporting forward landing gear position, the trailer center of grayity is shifted forward to allow the container to be readily loaded and unloaded without tipping forward. A perspective view of one preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 4. Landing gear assembly 18 includes a brace 22 and a cross brace 24 for supporting and bracing individual landing gear posts 23a and 23b. This arrangement allows the landing gears to be operated in tandem. Crank assembly 21 is operable to retract or extend shaft 20 and thereby raise or lower landing gear pad 19, as shown by arrow 43. A carriage 26 supports and retains landing gear 18 in proper alignment with trailer 10a. Carriage 26 includes a base 36 that supports a landing gear 18 and a motive means 28, which may be an electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic motor. Motor control 38 includes an actuator 39 by which an actuating or controlling signal 40 is coupled to the motive means to operate shafts 29a and 29b in either a first or a second rotational direction, depending on the direction in which the landing gear are to be moved. Each shaft extends through a journaled bearing 30 formed within carriage 26. The shafts operate toothed pinions 31a and 31b along complementarily toothed racks 34a and 34b to move base 36 and landing gear 18 along the axis of trailer.10a. Other embodiments of the invention may substitute driven chains for racks 34a and 34b. The racks may be positioned facing downwardly, if desired, to prevent the accumulation of dirt that could interfere with rack and pinion operation. Idler gears 32a and 32b, and 33a and 33b are provided to support the weight of the landing gear and carriage and to stabilize the carriage along support points to prevent rocking or excessive movement of the landing gear. The landing gear are spaced from the trailer to prevent drag as they are slid along the axis of the trailer between the first landing gear position and the second landing gear position. Although a rack and rotating pinion transport mechanism is shown in Fig. 4, linearly extensible actuators may also be provided in other embodiments of the invention. In such other embodiments, the landing gear include flanges arranged to slide along the trailer axis on a bearing surface, preferably encoated with a non stick material or lubricant. Other such devices may be used to move the landing gear relative to the trailer. It is most important to note that the landing gear are readily moved along the trailer axis between a support position for carrying a containerized load and preventing its tipping during container loading or unloading, and a transport position for providing ample truck tractor rear wheel clearance when the trailer and load are transported on a highway. Such landing gear movement is shown in Fig. 3 by arrow 42. Another embodiment of the invention combines the sliding landing gear with an extendable trailer of the type set forth in applicant1s copending patent application Serial No. 491,142, filed 3 May 1983, for a Universal Chassis For Shipping Containers that may be used to accommodate containers of all sizes. In such embodinient, the landing gear are moved to various posi tians along the trailer axis depending upon the support r quirements and center of gravity of the container carried by the extendable trailer. A side elevational schematic view of a truck tractor trailer and trailer container combination showing in sequence operation of a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 5. A container 50 is supported by a trailer 52 which is towed by a truck tractor 54. A container rear portion 60 rests on a transverse cross brace 58, shown positioned central to rear wheel assembly 55 between a first axle and wheel combination 56a and a second axle and wheel combination 56b. In this configuration, the load of container 50 is evenly supported by both wheel and axle combinations 56a and 56b. However, a rear trailer portion 62 produces a gap between the trailer rear portion 60 and loading dock D Fig. 5A . The present invention solves this problem by sliding cross brace 58 rearwardly as indicated by arrow 59 until container rear portion 60 is flush with a rear portion of the trailer Fig. 5B . In this way, there is no gap between the rear portion of the container and the loading dock, and loading is thus facilitated. In Fig. 5A, landing gear 51 is shown shifted rearwardly along the trailer axis to a transport position that provides ample truck tractor rear wheel clearance Fig. 5B shows landing gear 51 shifted forwardly along the trailer axis to a support position that prevents trailer container tipping by providing a balanced trailer center of gravity. A perspective view of the second preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 6.Trailer 52 is shown including parallel racks 64a and 64b that extend along the axis of the trailer at a rear portion thereof. In other embodiments of the invention, driven chains may be substituted for racks 64a and 64b. Transverse cross brace 58 is movable along the racks by cooperating engagement of cross brace asso .ciated.pinions 65a and 75b with the rack. The pinions are rotated to effect movement of cross brace 58 by shafts 66a and 66b, which are driven by motive means 67, which may be an electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic motor. Thus, the container may be shifted rearwardly to allow ready loading and unloading at a dock. Addi tionally, such rearward shifting of the load, correspondingly shifts the container s center of gravity rearwardly. Accordingly, landing gear 51 Fig. 5 is effectively moved from a position near center along the container s axis to a position forward along the container s axis. In this wssy, the center of gravity is shifted and tipping of the trailer is prevented. Cooperation of sliding cross brace 58 and sliding landing gear 51 Fig. 5 optimizes balanced trailer transport and trailer support while providing ready trailer access for container loading and unloading. The invention is particularly well suited for operation in concert with an extendable trailer, as referenced above. For example, a front portion of the extendable trailer is arranged to telescope inwardly or outwardly in relation to the rear trailer portion as the container is shifted by the sliding cross brace from an over. center position between wheel and axle assemblies 56a and 56b and a rearward position for docking for loading. and unloading. Although motive means are shown for both preferred embodiments of the invention, it is possible to use a hand crank assembly to effect movement of the landing gear and of the transverse cross brace. Additionally, although not shown, it is contemplated that any of the type of know locking device should be included to arrest movement of the landing gear and transverse cross brace when a desired position is obtained. Such locking mechanisms are necessary to prevent unnecessary shifting of the landing gear or of the container while the trailer and container are transported or docked for. loading and unloading. A simple mechanism, such as a pin and corresponding aperture or a more complicated mechanism, such as a piston and cylinder assembly, may be provided to effect locking of the landing gear and or transverse cross brace. Both embodiments of the invention may be combined in a trailer, or the embodiments may be provided singly, as desired. Additionally, the rack and pinion drive shown may be replaced with a driven chain, screw drive, cylinder and piston, and so on.
