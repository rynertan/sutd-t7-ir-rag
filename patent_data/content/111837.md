# METHOD OF X RAY IMAGING USING SLIT SCANNING WITH CONTROLLED TARGET ERASE

## Abstract
A method of x ray imaging the internal features of an object undergoing examination in which the object is scanned with a beam of x ray radiation. The radiation is transmitted through the object as primary imaging radiation and as scatter radiation. The image degrading effect of scatter radiation is reduced by employing a controlled TV camera tube target erase. The controlled target erase consists of a camera tube target raster scan by an electron beam controlled in the vertical position so as to immediately precede in position on the target the latent image charge pattern moduled thereon by exposure to primary imaging radiation. In this manner, the scatter radiation that leads in position the primary radiation is erased from the target prior to read out and, therefore, does not contribute to the TV image formation. The method is also effective in reducing the effects of electron scatter occurring in an image intensifier tube and optical scatter occurring in system optical elements.
