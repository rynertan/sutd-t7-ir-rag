# Preserving agent.

## Abstract
A tablet for use in preserving samples of milk for analysis comprises bronopol 2 bromo 2 nitropropane 1,3 diol and a water soluble solid organic carboxylic acid, the amount of the organic acid being within the range 0.002 0.07 milli equivalents per milligram of bronopol. The presence of the organic acid stabilises the bronopol, thereby providing a tablet with an adequate shelf life. Suitable organic acids include citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, adipic acid, succinic acid and fumaric acid.
