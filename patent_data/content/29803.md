# Organic polymeric materials stabilized with calcium stearoyl lactate.

## Abstract
Organic polymers selected from the group consisting of polyolefins unsaturated elastomers copolymers of monoolefines and diolefines with other vinyl monomers polystyrene and copolymers thereof polymers which are derived from α,β unsaturated acids and derivatives thereof and copolymers of these monomers with other unsaturated monomers polymers derived from unsaturated alcohols and amines or derivatives thereof polyacetals polamides and copolyamides are stabilized against thermooxidative deterioration by the addition of acylated hydroxy acid type compounds of the formula I Reference is made to claim 1 with regard to the mean ings of the substituents and symbols in formula I .
