## Description
INTEGRAL MULTILAYER ANALYTICAL ELEMENT FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF BILIRUBIN BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the invention The present invention relates to an integral multilayer analytical element for quantitative analysis of bilirubin, and more particularly to an integral multilayer analytical element employable for quantitative analysis of bilirubin based on a dry system with high accuracy by a simple and quick operation.Description of prior arts Bilirubin, a principal component of a bile pigment in a body fluid, is produced in serum by decomposition of heme originating from hemoglobin in red blood corpuscle. Bilirubin is then absorbed by a liver, in which bilirubin is converted to a glucuronic acid conjugated product, etc. and excreted in bile. The content of bilirubin in blood increases in response to increase of decomposition of hemoglobin as well as decrease of the liver function. Accordingly, the quantitative analysis of bilirubin is considered to be an indispensable test item in the clinical test. As a method for quantitative analysis of bilirubin in serum, there is known a colorimetric quantitative analysis of red azobilirubin produced by coupling reaction of bilirubin and diazotized sulfanilate p sulfobenzenediazonium salt, Ehrlich reagent based on Ehrlich reaction discovered by A. A. Hijmans van den Bergh.This method is generally named a diazo method. Details of methods for quantitative analysis of bilirubin in serum are described in the following publications M. Michaelsson Scan. J. Clin. Lab. Invenst. 13 Supple. , 1 80 1961 H. Malloy J. Biol. Chem., 119, 481 1939 Z. K. Shihabi et al. American Journal of MedicalTechnology, 43 10 , 1004 1007 1977 Comprehensive Text of Clinical Test Technology edited by Ishii, Vol. 6, pp. 332 350 Igaku Shoin, 1975 and, Clinical Chemical Analysis II, Nitrogenous Component edited by the Analytical Chemical Society ofJapan, 2nd edition, pp. 248 279 Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 1979 . A great number of analytical processes for quantitative analysis of bilirubin based on the above mentioned diazo method employing a dry analytical element have been proposed, for instance, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 53 1978 28119, and Japanese Patent ProvisionalPublications Nos. 54 1979 33094, 55 1980 44992, 56 1981 10255, 56 1981 30503, and 57 1982 23859. On the other hand, a number of studies on improvement of the analytical accuracy of a multilayer analytical element for quantitative analysis of bilirubin by way of utilizing a non fibrous isotropically porous spreading layer have been already made and described inJapanese Patent Publication No. 57 1982 25783 and Japanese Patent Provisional Publications Nos. 57 1982 37262 and 57 1982 110942. It is noted, however, that all of the multilayer analytical elements for quantitative analysis of bilirubin employing an isotropically porous spreading layer described in these publications are not based on the above mentioned diazo method, but based on other quantitative analytical systems. A multilayer analytical element based on the diazo method is thought to have some drawbacks described below. First, non diffusive bilirubins such as proteinconjugated bilirubin is difficultly detectable, and accordingly the total bilirubin content is not appropriately analyzed by the analytical element. Bilirubin is generally present in the form of being combined with a protein e.g. serum albumin in a liquid sample. If an analytical element having a polymer film disturbing permeation of the protein laminated thereon is employed for the analysis, the liquid sample is required to be processed with a dissociating agent such as caffeine, dyphylline C. A. Registory No 479 18 5 , sodium benzoate, or sodium acetate for separating bilirubin from the protein in advance of the analysis.Accordingly, in order to quantitatively analyzing the bilirubin combined with a protein, such bilirubin should sufficiently migrate or diffuse into a reagent layer containing a detection reagent, so that it can be detectable upon reaction with the detection reagent. For this reason, the conventional integral multilayer analytical element for this purpose contains the dissociating agent in the spreading layer. Nevertheless, the dissociating agent is not effective for dissociating a bilirubin conjugated with albumin through covalent bonding, which has a comparatively large molecular weight and a hydrophobic molecular structure.Therefore the migration and diffusion of the conjugated bilirubin cannot be enhanced in such case. Second, stability of the diazonium salt is low, and accordingly preservability of the multilayer analytical element employing diazonium salt is insufficient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of the present invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element for quantitative analysis of bilirubin which enables a nonmigratory non diffusive bilirubin to sufficiently diffuse within a porous reagent layer. Another object of the invention is to provide an integral multilayer analytical element in which the stability and preservability of diazonium salt is improved. There is provided by the present invention an integral multilayer analytical element for quantitative analysis of bilirubin in a liquid sample by a diazo method, which comprises a laminated structure consisting essentially of 1 a porous reagent layer which contains a polymer having a sulfonic acid group in the repeating unit and a diazonium salt being reactive to bilirubin to produce azobilirubin 2 an absorbent layer capable of absorbing an excessive liquid portion and 3 a liquid impermeable light transmissive support. According to the present invention, the drawbacks of the conventional analytical element brought about by the non diffusiveness of the analyte is obviated by the provision of the absorbent layer to the analytical element, whereby making it possible to detect a non migratory non diffusive bilirubin. The absorbent layer of the invention serves to absorb a solvent i.e., liquid medium of a liquid sample without accepting a bilirubin in the liquid sample to elevate the concentration of the bilirubin diffusing into the reagent layer, whereby enhancing the efficiency of the reaction between the nonmigratory non diffusive bilirubin and a detection reagent. Further the porous reagent layer of this invention contains a polymer having a sulfonic acid group in the repeating units, so that the stability and preservability of diazonium salt is improved. The polymer having a sulfonic acid group in the repeating unit is such an acidic binder that it effectively protects the diazonium salt. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The porous reagent layer of the invention can be prepared by superposing, for instance, through pressing, the material of the porous reagent layer having the polymer and diazonium salt on the absorbent layer provided on a transparent support, to obtain an integrated structure. The diazonium salt, acidic binder and other additives can be incorporated into the porous reagent layer, for instance, by immersing the porous material into a solution containing these substances or by coating the solution substances over the porous material, and then drying the material. Otherwise, the solution containing these substances can be coated on a reagent layer integrally combined with an absorbent layer on a support, and the so treated integral element is dried. The material constituting a matrix of the porous reagent layer of the invention can be a material having voids allowing easy migration or diffusion of a high molecular weight analyte in and through the material.Examples of the material include filter paper, non woven fabric, woven fabric, knitted cloth, glass fiber sheet e.g., glass fiber filter , and membrane filter formed of blushed polymer. Examples of the woven fabrics woven cloth which can be used for the porous reagent layer include those disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional PublicationsNo. 55 1980 164356 and No. 57 1982 66359. Among the woven fabrics, plain weave fabrics made of warp and weft are preferred. Among plain woven fabrics, thin cloth, muslin, broadcloth and poplin are preferred. Examples of yarns for woven cloth include those composed of the same materials as those constituting knitted cloths as described in more detail hereinafter.Any of filament yarn and spun yarn twist yarn can be used, and the spun yarn is preferred. The yarn diameter of the woven fabric is generally in the range of about 20S to about 150S, preferably about 40S to about 120S in terms of cotton spinning yarn count or in the range of about 35 to about 300D, preferably about 45 to about 130D in terms of silk thread denier. The thickness of the woven fabric is generally in the range of about 100 to about 500 um, preferably about 120 to 350 Vm. The voids of the woven fabroc are generally in the range of about 40 to about 90d o, preferably about 50 to about 85 . Examples of the knitted fabrics which can be used for the porous reagent layer include many kinds of knitted fabrics, among which warp knitted fabric and weft knitted fabric are preferred. Examples of the warp knitted fabrics include single atlas knitted cloth, tricot knitted cloth, double tricot knitted cloth, milanese knitted cloth and rashar knitted cloth. Examples of the weft knitted fabrics include plain weave knitted cloth, pearl knitted cloth, rib stitch cloth, and double face knitted cloth.Examples of the yarns for knitted fabrics include yarns of natural fibers such as cotton, silk and wool yarns composed of fine fibers or single fibers of regenerated cellulose e.g. viscose rayon and cupra , semi synthetic organic polymer e.g. cellulose diacetate and cellulose triacetate , synthetic organic polymer e.g. polyamide such as nylon, acetalated polyvinyl alcohol such as vinylon, polyacrylonitrile, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyurethane , and yarns composed of fiber blends of a natural fiber and a regenerated cellulose or a semi synthetic or synthetic organic polymer fiber. Any of filament yarn and spun yarn can be used, and spun yarn is preferred.The diameter of the yarn for knitted fabric is generally in the range of from about 40 to 150S, preferably about 60 to about 120S in terms of cotton spinning yarn count, or in the range of about 35 to about 130D, preferably about 45 to about 90D in terms of silk thread denier. The number of knitting gauge of the knitted fabric is generally in the range of about 20 to about 50. The thickness of the knitted fabric is generally in the range of about 100 to about 600 um, preferably about 150 to about 400 pm. The voids of the knitted fabric are generally in the range of about 40 to about 90 , preferably about 50 to about 85 .The warp knitted fabric, tricot knitted cloth, rashar knitted cloth, milanese knitted cloth and double tricot knitted cloth are preferred, because shrinkage in the wale s direction is small, the operation in the lamination stage of knitted goods is easy and the stitches are not easily loosened during cutting. The material employable for forming the matrix of the porous reagent layer of the invention is not restricted by the above described materials. For instance, non fabric isotropically porous layer prepared by a coating method described in Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 53 1978 21677 and U.S. Patent 3,992,158 can be used. Examples of the diazonium salt employable as the bilirubin detection reagent include a variety of diazonium salts being conventionally known in the art of quantitative analysis of bilirubin utilizing the wet and dry diazo methods. Among these diazonium salts, a stable diazonium salt is preferred. Examples of the stable diazonium salt include dichlorobenzenediazonium salt, sulfobenzenediazonium salt, N substituted sulfoneamidebenzenediazonium salt, dichloronitrobenzene diazo nium salt, substituted biphenylbisdiazonium salt and an aryl diazonium salt disclosed in Japanese Patent Appliraction No. 58 1983 45547 which contains an alkoxycarbonyl group, alkylaminosulfonyl group or alkylaminocarbonyl group. Further the above diazonium salts are preferably stabilized by way of utilizing a counter ion such as arylsulfonate, tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate etc. The polymer having a sulfonic acid group in the repeating unit is preferably a polymer in which at least 10 mol more preferably at least 30 mol of the repeating units contain a sulfoalkyl group or a sulfophenyl group. An example of the repeating unit which contains the sulfoalkyl group has the formula I EMI8.1 in which R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen atom or methyl group and 3R3 represents an alkyl group containing 1 18 carbon atoms, an aryl or alkyl substituted aryl group containing 6 10 carbon atoms, or an alkoxycarbonyl group containing 1 5 carbon atoms. 3 R3 in the formula 1 is preferably an alkyl group containing 1 8 carbon atoms, phenyl group, or methoxycarbonyl group, more preferably methyl group, ethyl group or propyl group. A monomer which gives the repeating unit represented in the formula I may be prepared by a known method or a similar method. For example, the preparation of the monomer in which R1 is hydrogen atom, is described in U.S. Patent 3,506,707. Examples of the monomer which give the repeating unit represented in the formula I include N sulfoalkyl acrylamide preferably, N B sulfo t butyl acryl amide and N sulfoalkyl methacrylamide preferrably, N sulfo t butyl methacrylamide . Examples of the monomer having sulfophenyl group in the repeating unit include p styrene sulfonate. The polymer having a sulfoalkyl group in the repeating units may be a copolymer between a monomer of the formula I and other monomer which can be copolymerized with the former monomer. Examples of the latter monomer include an olefin e.g., ethylene, propylene etc. acrylic acid and its derivatives, such as acrylic acid, acrylate ester e.g., methyl ester, ethyl ester , acrylate hydroxyalkyl ester e.g., hydroxyethyl ester and acrylamide methacrylic acid and its derivatives, such as methacrylic acid, methacrylate ester e.g., methyl ester, ethyl ester, butyl ester, isobutyl ester, hexyl ester , methacryl amide and methacrylate hydroxyalkyl ester e.g., hydroxyethyl ester and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, such as maleic acid and fumaric acid. The polymer may be a homopolymer. Examples of the homopolymer include poly 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropane sul fonate and poly 2 methacrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonate. These polymers having a sulfonic acid group in the repeating units can be easily prepared referring to the following publications Synthesis of Polymer I edited by C. G. Overberger translated by T. Ohtsu and M. Kinoshita KagakuDojin, 1972 . The polymers can be used in the form of the mixture with other water soluble polymer. Examples of the other water soluble polymer include polyacrylamide, poly nvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and agarose. The polymers containing a sulfonic acid group in the repeating units may be also used in the form of a mixture of the polymer and an aqueous latex of a hydrophobic polymer. An aryl sulfonic acid can be optionally incorporated in the porous reagent layer of this invention.Examples of the aryl sulfonic acid include benzenesulfonic acid and its derivatives such as benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, xylenesulfonic acid and sulfosalicylic acid and naphthalenesulfonic acid. In these aryl sulfonic acids, the substituted position of the sulfo group is not restricted. It is supposed that the aryl sulfonic acid has some effects such as stabilizing preventing decomposition of the diazonium salt, adjusting or buffering pH by its own acidity and promoting condensation reaction between bilirubin and diazonium salt. Accordingly the aryl sulfonic acid can be utilized to improve or complement the effect of the polymer containing a sulfonic acid group in the repeating unit. Thus, the aryl sulfonic acid content may be determined according to the effect of the said polymer, but in general the content is in the range of about 7 to about 70 times preferably, about 10 to about 50 times as much as the diazonium compound content by weight ratio. Light blocking fine particles can be also optionally incorporated in the porous reagent layer of this invention. Examples of the light blocking fine particles include white particles such as titanium dioxide fine particles rutile type or anatase type or barium sulfate particles. The light blocking fine particles are used to enhance the stability of white reflection density of azobilirubin produced in proportion to the bilirubin density, when the reflection density is measured from the side of the transparent support by means of reflection photometry. Further, the light blocking particles in this integral multilayer analytical element for quantitative analysis of bilirubin have another effect to assure metering effect in wide range of the quantity of the sample spotted and supplied. The metering effect is a function capable of spreading a liquid sample an aqueous liquid sample such as whole blood, blood plasina serum, urine etc. in such a manner that the spread area of the liquid is approximately in proportion to the amount of the liquid. The porous reagent layer of the invention can con tain a diazo coupling accelerater, a surface active agent, and or other additives, in addition to the diazonium salt, the polymer having a sulfonic acid group, Fhe aryl sulfonic acid and the light blocking fine parti cles. The porous reagent layer of the invention preferably contains a reaction accelerater to accelerate the reaction between the analyte and the diazonium salt. The reactivity between bilirubin and a diazonium salt is prominently influenced by the solubility of the bilirubin. Since the free bilirubin indirect bilirubin of non conjugate type is highly hydrophobic and sparingly water soluble, the rate of reaction with a diazonium is low. In contrast, since the conjugate biLi rubin and albumin conjugated bilirubin are highly soluble in water, these rapidly reacts with a diazonium salt. Accordingly, the difference on the reaction rate residing between a variety of bilirubins is utilized to analyze separately each of the direct bilirubin conjugate or protein conjugated bilirubin and the indirect bilirubin free bilirubin . The analytical element of the present invention can be employed in the same manner to separately analyze each of the direct and indirect bilirubins. In the quantitative analysis of the total bilirubin content or a quick analysis of the indirect bilirubin, a reaction accelerator is necessarily included in the analytical element. The reaction accelerator employable for this purpose is known and described in a variety of texts. Examples of the accelerator include alcohols e.g., methanol, ethanol, etc. , caffeine, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, dyphylline C. A. Registory No. 479 18 5 , urea, a nonionic surfactant, gum arabic, an acid amide, sulfoxide, etc. The reaction accelerator can be optionally incorporated into the analytical element of the present invention. The absorbent layer of this invention is constituted by a material comprising a hydrophilic polymer as a main component. The hydrophilic polymer preferably contains a group capable of attracting and retaining the introduced water or aqueous medium within the absorbent layer through strong hydrogen bond, preferably has a degree of swelling at a high level, and is preferably water insoluble. The degree of swelling of the absorbent layer preferably ranges from approx. 1.5 to approx. 30 times, more preferably from approx. 2.5 to approx. 20, as much as the orignal volume. In this specification, the term degree of swelling means a ratio of thickness of a wetted layer to a dry layer, in which the thickness of the wetted layer is measured upon reaching an equilibrium state after swelling the dry layer with water at 300C on a polyethylene terephthalate support. The hydrophilic polyer employable for the formation of or incorporation into the absorbent layer can be a non porous polymer capable of absorbing and retaining water because of its swelling property or other properties, or a polymer having cross linked molecular chains capable of absorbing and retaining water of its microporous structure showing a swelling property. Examples of the hydrophilic polymer satisfying the above described conditions include natural polymers or their crosslinked products such as gelatin, dextran, starch, and modified starch homopolymers and copolymers of hydrophilic monomers such as hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, N hydroxyalkyl acrylamide e.g., N 3 hydroxy acrylamide, etc. polyvinyl alcohol and copolymers of the acrylamide with one or more of the above mentioned monomers, in which the homopolymer and copolymer can be modified through crosslinking.Most preferred is gelatin. The swelling degrees of some hydrophilic polymers are given below. Unhardened gelatin approx. 6 Hardened gelatin approx. 3 4 hydroxyethyl modified agarose approx. 1.5 Dextran approx. 2 Crosslinked polyacrylamide agarose approx. 17 Polyhydroxyethyl acrylate acrylamide gel approx. 15 Crosslinked or non crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol approx. 3 15 The thickness of the absorbent layer preferably ranges from 3 to 50 jim, most preferably from 10 to 30 jim. Not only single absorbent layer but also plural absorbent layers can be constituted. There is no spcecific limitation on the support employable in the invention, so far as it allows transmission of light but not allows permeation of water. Such support is already known in the art. Examples of the support include transparent supports made of glass plate or high transparent synthetic resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate of bisphenol A, polystyrene, cellulose esters and polyacrylates. The thickness of the support generally ranges from approx. 50 jim to approx. 2 mm, preferably from approx. 80 jim to approx. 300 jim. As described hereinbefore, the integral multilayer analytical element of the present invention comprises the laminated structure of the porous reagent layer, the absorbent layer, and the support. These layers are preferably laminated in the order mentioned above. Further, the integral multilayer analytical element can further have one or more functional layers such as a spreading layer, an analyte bilirubin, a conjugated complex between bilirubin and other substance, etc. diffusion preventing layer, or a light blocking layer.Accordingly, the integral multilayer analytical elements having such other layers are also embodiments of the invention. The present invention is further described by the following examples.

On the other hand, in the element using malic acid or tartaric acid, 10 to 20 of the diazonium salt remained. EXAMPLE 6 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the titanium dioxide fine particles were not employed in the coating solution IV , to prepare an analytical slide for quantitative analysis of bilirubin.
