# Transformer having concentric coils.

## Abstract
The coils 19 are provided on a tubular section 5 of a coil former 3 at least one of these coils being separated from the next coil through the fact that the second of said coils is provided on an electrically insulating foil 41 wound around the first coil. Each of these two coils 19 is located in a winding space 27 , which extends on both sides of the centre of the tubular section 5 in the axial direction to limits 37 located at a predetermined distance from the ends thereof, whilst the foil 41 extends in the axial direction to beyond those limits. In order to ensure an adequate insulation between the leads 17 of consecutive coils 19 and in order to enable subsequent thereto a simple check whether a coil 19 is indeed wholly contained within the prescri bed winding space 27 , the foil 41 extends in the axial direction substantially to the ends of the tubular section 5 and the foil is transparent and has visually observable marks 43 at the location of the limits 37 of the winding space 27 .
