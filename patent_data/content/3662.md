# Single station type fire alarm system and a multivibrator used in the detection circuitry.

## Abstract
A multivibrator includes two C MOS inverters 10 and 11 with the input of one inverter 11 connected to the output of the other. The output of the one inverter 11 is connected by a resistor 16 and capacitor 17 in series to its input and the junction of the resistor and capacitor is connected to the base of a transistor 14 having its emitter connected to one pole of the D.C. supply and its collector connected to the input of said other inverter. This arrangement reduces the current drawn by the multivibrator. A fire alarm system incorporating the multivibrator is also disclosed.
