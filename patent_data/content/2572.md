The preferred polymers contain 40 to 75 wt. ethylene and 1 to 10 wt. of a diene monomer, the balance of the polymer being propylene.Preferably, the polymer contains 45 to 70 wt. ethylene, e.g. 50 wt. , and 2.6 to 8.0 wt. diene monomer, e.g. 5.0 wt. . The diene monomer is preferably a non conjugated diene. Illustrative of these non conjugated diene monomers which may be used in the terpolymer EPDM are 1,4 hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 5 metylene 2 norbornene, 5 propenyl 2 norbornene, and methyl tetrahydroindene. A typical EPDM is Vistalon 2504 Exxon ChemicalCo. a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F of 40 and having an ethylene content of 50 wt. and a 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene content of 5.0 wt. 7..

The preparation of these neutralized sulfonated elatoms has ben described in U.S. Patent 3,642,728 and U.S. Serial c. 855,553. The exact method employed to prepare the neutralized sulfonated EPDM or Butyl is not of critical importance provided the resulting product is substantially free of covalent cross linking or gel free has the requisite sulfonate content, and exhibits the rheological characteristics descrIbed in this application. The melt viscosity of the polymeric systems investigated were determined by the use of an Instron Capillary Rheometer. Generally, the melt viscosity measurements were made at a temperature of 200 C. and at various shear rates corresponding to crosshead speeds from .005 in min to 20 in min. The apparent viscosity at 200 C. and at a shear rate of .73 sec 1 .005 in min is employed as a characterization parameter in this invention. A measure oi the melt elasticity of a given system can also be obtained from these rheological measurements. A type of flow instability known as melt fracture is exhibited by many polymeric materials of high molecular weight. This phenomenon is shear sensitive and thus will generally exhibit itself at a given shear rate and temperature. The shear rate for the onset of melt fracture Indicates the upper shear rate for processing a given at i l. This is used as a characterization parameter for compounds empl yed in extrusion processing. The metal sulfonate containing polymers at the higher sulfonate levels possess extremely high melt viscosities and are thereby difficult to process. The addition of ionic group plasticizers markedly reduces melt viscosity and frequently enhances physical properties. To the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer ai d, in either solution or to the crumb of the un sulfonated elastomeric polymer, a preferential t which may be a acid having 5 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule, more pre fera ly 8 to 22 carbon atoms, or basic salts of these carboxy li acids wherein the cation of the basic salt is aluminium, ammonium, lead or a metal ofGroups IA, IIA, 13 and IIB of the Periodic Table of Elements cr a mixture thereof.The carboxylic acids and metal carboxy lates may be lauric, myristic, palmitic or stearic acids or mixtures thereof e.g. zinc stearate, magnesium stearate or zinc laurate. The preferential plasticizer may be incorporated into the neutral zed sulfonated elastomeric polymer at o to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts of the sul fonated polymer, more preferably at 5 to 40, and most preferably at 7 to 25. The metallic salt of the fatty acc can also be used as neutralizing agent. In e case of the neutralizing agent and plasticizer being tbe identical chemical species, additional met lli s is added over the required levels of neutralization.Alternative preferential plasti cizers are organic esters, phenols, trialkyl phosphates, alcohols, amines, asides, ammonium and amine salts of carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. The preferred plasticizers are fatty acid or metallicsalts of fatty acid and mixtures thereof. The resultant neutralized. sulfonated elastomeric polymer with preferential plasticizer is isolated from the solution by conventional steam stripping and filtration. The resultant neutralized and plasticized sulfonated elastomer has a viscosity at 2000 C. and a shear rate at .73 sec l of 1 x 104 poise to 5 x 106 poise, more preferably of S x 104 poise to 2 x 106 poise and most preferably of 1 x 105 poise to 1 x 106 poise. The resultant neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer with preferential plasticizer is isolated from the solution by conventional steam stripping or coagulation followed by fltration. The neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer is blended with a ncn polar wax or a combination of a filler and a non polar wax by techniques well known in the art.For example, the blend composition can be compounded on a two roil mill. Other methods known in the art which are suitable for making these compositions include those methods employed in the plastic and elastomer industries for mixing polymer systems. An excellent polymer blend composition of this invention can be obtained through the use of a high shear batch intensive mixer called the Banbury. Alternatively, economic advantages in terms of time and labor save ings can be obtained through the use of a Fa el ContinuousMixer, a twin screw extruder, or extrusion techniques which are continuous mixing type equipment. The Banbury mixing device is the preferred batch type mixer, and the twin screw extruder is the preferred continuous mixer. The fillers employed in the present invention are selected from talcs, ground calcium carbonate, water precipitated calcium carbonate, or delaminated, calcined or hydrated clays and mixtures thereof. These fillers maybe incorporated into the blend composition at 25 to 350 parts by weight per 100 parts of the sulfonated polymer, more preferably at 50 to 350 and most preferably at 50 to 300.Typically, these fillers have a particle size of 0.03 to 20 microns, more preferably 0.3 to 10, and most preferably 0.5 to 10. The oil absorption as measured by grams of oil absorbed by 100 grams of filler is 10 to 100, more preferably 10 to 85 and most preferably 10 to 75.

The petroleum and synthetic waxes are most important for the present invention. Other than paraffinic, napthenic and aromatic hydrocarbon groups waxes can contain polar functional grouts such as alcohols, ketones, and esters. It is preferred thP the waxes used in this invention be predominantly non polar since polar functional groups function as plasticizers for the ionic sulfonate groups. Excessive plasticization is undesirable. The largest percentage of polar functional groups in waxes are those containing cxygen by virtue of hydrocarbon oxidation. For the purpose of this invention a wax is considered to be non polar when it contains less than 4.0 wt. , more preferably less than 2.0 wt. 7. oxygen. A description of paraffinic and microcrystalline waxes is given in the Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of PolymerScience and Technolog , 1971, Vol. 14, pp. 768 779 and is abstracted below. Paraffin waxes consist primarily of straightchain saturated hydrocarbons with only a small amount of branching such as 2 methyl groups, near the end of the chain. The amount of n alkanes in paraffin wax usually exceeds 757. and may reach almost 1GO. The molecular weights of the hydrocarbons in paraffin wax range from 280 to 560 C20 C40 , with each specific wax having a range of about eight to fifteen carbon numbers. The ranges of properties representative of several different paraffin waxes are presented in Table 2.Some of the commercial waxes included in the listed propperty range are also given. Paraffin waxes are generally lower melting, have lower molecular weights, and have lower viscosities when liquid than microcrystalline waxes. Paraffin waxes,.in the solid state, exist in the form of large, distinct crystals, in contrast to the microscopic crystals of microcrystalline waxes. Physical properties of paraffin wax of an average molecular weight of 400 are listed inTable 3. Paraffin wax is soluble in non polar organic solvents such as benzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachldride, and naphtha, and insoluble in polar solvents such as water and methanol.

Microcrystalline waxes are the solid hydrocarbon mixtures refined from crude petrolatums, which are obtained from the dewaxing of residual lubricating oil stocks and tank bottom wax. These waxes are known as microcrystaln because their relatively small crystals give an amorphous appearance to the waxes in the solid state. Microcrystalline waxes vary considerably in compositian and properties, in contrast to paraffin wax. Gen erally, microcrystalline waxes consist of branched chain hydrocarbons and alkyl cycloaliphatic naphthenic hydrocarbons as well as some straight chain molecules, depending on the particular wax. The molecular weights range from 450 to 800 C35 C60 . Some physical properties are listed in Table 3.

Z. The waxes employ in the present invention usually have a softening point of 125 F to 220oF, more preferably 1350F to 200 F, and most preferably 1500F to 200 F . The preferred waxes have an Mn of 300 to 4000. Some of the typical waxes are described in Table 2. These waxes are typically crystal line wherein the percent crystallinity can vary depending on the composition of the wax and the Mn. The incorporation of the waxes at the levels described in this invention imparts some beneficial and srprising characteristics to the sulfonated elastomeXic compounds. Those benefits include a significant reduction of melt viscosity at elevated temperature for these compounds, with little sacrifice in physical properties at ambient temperatures, a reduction in tack at room temperature, and a substantial improvement in the resistance of these sulfonated EPDM based compounds to moisture during prolonged immersion. This latter characteristic is of substantial im portance because these ionic elastomers can pick up as much as 30 to 50 wt. moisture after prolonged immersion at 500 C. In contrast the incorporation of a suitable wax at a sufficient level will markedly reduce the level of water sensitivity. The magnitude of this improvement is believed to depend on the amount of wax incorporated. In addition to these improvements, it is observed that the addition of modest levels of wax to sulfonated elastomer compounds improves the extrusion behavior at elevates temperatures b providing a more uniform flow than is obtain ned in the absence of wax. This improvement is detectable at a relatively low level of wax, from 2 to 15 wt. based an compound. The ingredients incorporated into the blend compositions of the present inventian, in conjunction with the type of elastomeric polymer, the degree f sulfonation, and the metal counterion of the neutralized sulfcnated elasto mericXpolymer and the plasticizer give materials processable by extrusion o rejection molding processes into elastomeric articles having the desirable physical and rheological properties. The advantages of both the rheological and physi, cal properties of the blared compositions of the present invention can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples and tables. Unless otherwise speci fied, all measurements are in parts per hundred by weight. EXAMPLE 1 One hundred grams of an EPDM terpolymer, Vistalon 2504 20, was dissolved under agitation in 1000 ml. of nhexane at 40 C. The resultant cement was cooled to room temperature and 5.74 ml. of acetic anhydride 60.75 mmoles was then added. While stirring the mixture, 2.1 ml. of 957. 112504 37.5 mmcles was added dropwise. The sulfonation reaction was quenched after 30 minutes with 150 ml. of isopropanol. The acid form of the sulfonated polymer was analyzed by Dietert Sulfur Analysis to have 33 meq. of SO3H groups per 100 grams of sulfonated polymer. To the quenched sulfonated cement was added with stirring for thirty minutes 25.6 grams 90 moles 100 grams of EPDM of stearic acid.A solution of 9.87 grams 90 meq. 100 g. of EPDM of zinc acetate dihydrate dissolved in 25 ml. of distilled water was then added in the cement and the cement stirred for an additional 30 minutes. Antioxidant 2246. 0.5 grams was then added to the cement. The resultant plasticized, neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer was then isolated by steam stripping and drying on a rubber mill at 220 F., wherein the sulfonated terpolymer has an apparent viscosity at 0.73 sec l at 200 C. of about 3.3 x 105 poise. This material was incapable of being injection molded on a low pressure Desma machine equipped with a standard canvas foot wear type mold.EXAMPLE 2 The sulfonated EPDM gum was prepared in an iden tical manner as,described in Example 1. The polymer was blended with several different waxes by blending 10 parts of wax with 100 parts of Sulfo EPDM in a suitable Brabender mixing head at a temperature of about 175 C. until a smooth homogeneous dispersion was obtained, for a total of about 10 15 minutes. The resulting viscous melt was then sheeted out on a warm N200aF. two roll mill. The waxes employed are described in Table 4.

The relative flow values were obtained through a weight measurement of the extrudate after the equ valent of 10 minutes.

This characteristic is very desirable because such sulfonated elastomers can possess undesirably high melt viscosities.EXAMPLE 3 One of the undesirable characteristics of ionic elastomers in general, and sulfonated elastomer in particular, is that they can display a significant degree of water sensitivity. The incorporation of the types of waxes described in this application surprisingly reduces the degree of water sensitivity. The amount of wax incorporated in these blends will have an effect on the degree of improvement in water sensitivity observed. A series of wax SulfoEPDM blends was prepared as described in Example 2, except in these cases significantly higher levels of wax were incorporated in order to assess the effect more rapidly. The resultant blends were then compression molded at 3000F. to form pads about .020 inches thick. These pads were weighed and then immersed in water at 500C. for a period of 21 days.After that time period the pads were removed, surface moisture blotted off, and then weighed. The lncrease in weight was determined in terms of weight percent increased over the original pad weight. The values are given in Table 6.

For many injection molding applications this im provement in flow can be extremely important.EXAMPLE 5 The preparation of sulfonated EPDM was effected as described in Example 1 except that the gum was extended with about 40 parts of Sunpar 180 oil.

There are several surprising and important observations to be made from this comparison.The first one is that the compound containing the paraffinic wax at the low ievels employed again improves the flow behavior, although only slightly , as judged by the lower shear stress at a given shear rate, while simultaneously exhibiting improved physical properties when compared against the compound containing the amorphous polypropylene. A second observation is that the sample containing the amorphous polypropylene exhibits a tacky surface. This characteristic is often observed in soft compounds based on ionic elastomers at high oil extension levels. The presence of the low levels of wax shown in this example markedly improve this characteristic such that no significant level of tack is observed. The experiments above demonstrate that modest levels of wax can improve the flow and physical properties of sulfonated elastomers in important and surprising ways.In addition such waxes have the added benefit of reducing the degree of water sensitivity and tackiness often observed in such systems. Since many mcdifications and variations of this invention may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention thereof, it is not intended to limit the spirit or scope thereof to the specific examples thereof.
