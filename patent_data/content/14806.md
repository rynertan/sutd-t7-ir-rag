# Processing of chromium ore.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for the recovery of chrome hydrate or high purity Cr₂O₃ from chromium ores by roasting the ore with Na₂CO₃ and CaO, water leaching the roasted mass, precipitating aluminium impurities from the leach liquor as Al OH ₃ and contacting the leach liquor with sulfur and NaOH in order to reduce the chromium values in the leach liquor from valence 6 to 3 to provide a chrome hydrate precipi tate. The chrome hydrate precipitate may be acid repulped if it is desired to provide a chrome hydrate from which sodium impurities have been removed. If high purity Cr₂O₃ is required the chrome hydrate is dried and the resulting solids are cal cined.
