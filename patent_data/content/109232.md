# Sorbinal by optical resolution of precursor 6 fluro 4 ureidochroman 4 carboxylic acid.

## Abstract
Sorbinil is obtained by cyclization of S 6 fluoro 4 ureidoch romane 4 carboxylic acid, wich is in turn obtained by resolution of racemic 6 fluoro 4 ureidochroman 4 carboxylic acid dias teromeric salts with either D 1 phenethyl amine or L ephedrine.
