# DEMAND SET FIXTURING PROCESS

## Abstract
Demand set fixturing processes are provided for fixedly maintaining a preselected spatial orientation among a plurality of objects. According to a preferred embodiment, fixturing of a first object 18 relative to a second object 12 is accomplished by contacting said first and second objects 12, 18 with at least one portion of an actinic light polymerizable composition 24 , positioning said objects 12, 18 relative to each other to attain a preselected spatial orientation and irradiating said portion with actinic light for a time sufficient to cause polymerization of said composition 24 thereby fixedly maintaining said preselected orientation.
