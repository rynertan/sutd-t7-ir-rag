# Load commutated inverter for operating synchronous motor.

## Abstract
A load commutated inverter for operating a synchro nous motor 15 having two sets of 3 phase windings. The difference of phase angles between the two sets of the 3 phase windings is 30 degrees. The load commutated inverter is provided with two sets of inverters and a control circuit 21, 25, 26 . Each of the inverters 141, 142 , is formed of thyristors. The inverters 141, 142 are coupled respective ly to the 3 phase windings of the motor 15 . The commuta tion of each of the thyristors is controlled in accordance with a given advanced control angle β . The control circuit 21, 25, 26 is coupled to the inverters 141, 142 and is responsive to a commutation overlapping angle u of currents e.g., IU1, IV1 supplied from the inverters 141, 142 to the 3 phase windings of the motor 15 . The control circuit 21, 25, 26 adjusts the given advanced control angle β so as to retain a relation u γ 30 degrees wherein u denotes the commutation overlapping angle and γ corresponds to the reverse biasing time applied to each of the thyristors.
