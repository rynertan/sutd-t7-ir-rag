# Ethylene copolymers for hot melt systems.

## Abstract
Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers having a melt index of 700 to 10000 and containing from 11 to 40 vinyl acetate are useful in hot melt systems and particularly in formulating low viscosity hot melt adhesives, preferably in binary compositions with natural or synthetic resin tackifiers. The adhesives show long open times with short setting times, and excellent adhesive properties. The EVAs are prepared by a high pressure polymeriza tion, preferably by using chain transfer agent such as isobutylene to achieve high melt indices.
