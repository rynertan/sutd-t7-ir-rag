# Electronic assembly with forced convection cooling.

## Abstract
An electronic assembly including forced convection cooling comprises an elongate support plate 10 , a plurality of electronic equipment cabinets 11, 12, 26 and 27 mounted side by side on a common surface of the plate in the lon gitudinal direction thereof, at least one air distribution chan nel 21 extending longitudinally of the plate in the said common surface, and a cooling fan 20 mounted on the same surface of the plate as the cabinets for forcing air along the air distribution channel and into the cabinets for cooling electrical components therein. The assembly preferably includes means for directing air from the channel selectively in different quantities to different components according to their cooling require ments, such means including a plurality of secondary air distribution channels which branch laterally from the first mentioned channel, and means for confining air from the first mentioned channel to flow into the secondary channels.
