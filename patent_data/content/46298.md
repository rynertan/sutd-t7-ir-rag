# Apparatus for measuring a magnetic field.

## Abstract
A magnetic field measuring apparatus is effective for measuring magnetic fields in places, where elec trical means cannot be adopted for the measurement. The detecting portion C ist constructed of a small magnetic material having the Faraday rotation and is disposed at the end part or intermediate part of an optical fiber 1 . Light is guided to the detecting portion C by the optical fiber 1 . Transmitted or reflected light subjected to the Faraday rotation proportional to the intensity of the magnetic field in the detecting por tion C is guided to a measuring portion A by the optical fiber 1 .
