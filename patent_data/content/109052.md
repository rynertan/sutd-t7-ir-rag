# Graft copolymers and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
Under particular conditions, a cationic ring opening po lymerization of an oxirane monomer selected from the group consisting of an acyclic glycidyl ether, a cyclic glycidyl ether, and a haloalkyl epoxide, in the presence of a hydroxyl contain ing backbone of a polymer HCB and a particular catalyst, produces a polymerization having living polymerization char acteristics, provided the OH groups are aliphatic OH groups and not aromatic OH groups. The result is a graft copolymer the molecular weight mol wt of which is directly proportional to the conversion of the monomer. The HCB, which may have from 1 to 400 pendant OH groups, and more preferably at least 7 pendant OH groups, provides grafting sites for the grafting segments. Where a grafted segment contains halogen, the segment may be aminated. If the HCB is hydrophobic, the ami nated block copolymer is amphiphilic.
