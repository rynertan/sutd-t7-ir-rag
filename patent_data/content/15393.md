## Description
The invention relates to rhotorised actuation apparatus for opening and closing a slidable vehicle window there being a drive motor for each driven window and an actuation switch in respect of each motor each switch having a window closing position, a window. opening position and a neutral position.Actuation devices of this kind are known in many variants.They are generally actuated by means of a change over switch arranged alongside the driver s seat so that a desired vehicle window can be either opened or closed. Problems however occur with such actuation devices. For example on actuation of a window in the closure direction by the driver the finger of a passenger, in particular of a child can become trapped. This danger is particularly present if the driver actuates the window during a journey when he is required to concentrate completely on the traffic. Moreover the danger exists with children that they put their heads out of the window during the journey so that on automatic closing of the respective window the head or the throat of the child could become trapped.To protect against objects becoming trapped against the closure edges of doors there already exist switch strips which extend along the associated closur√® edge and, on the exertion of pressure via a trapped object, close a circuit which then terminates or reverses the closing operation via a control device DE OS 26 44 608 and DE OS 27 19 438 . It is also already known to construct the switch strip of two electrodes arranged spaced apart from each other which approach one another when loads are applied to the closure edge in the closure direction and which finally contact to initiate the control signal. The previously known protective devices are however not suitable for use on vehicle windows because in this case the closure edge of the window must be pressed with not inconsiderable pressure against the closure edge or frame of the window opening because of the necessity to seal the window. If conventional strip switches were used this would result in the known protective device initiating a change over signal without an object actually being trapped between the window and frame.The principal object of the invention thus resides in providing motorised actuation apparatus of the kind initially named in which the movement of the window will automatically be stopped or reversed when an object becomes trapped between the frame ,edge of the window opening and the closure edge of the window without however distadvantageously affecting the execution of the normal closing operation In order to accomplish this task the invention envisages in motorised actuation apparatus of the initially defined kind that, in each motor circuit, there is connected a break contact or switch over contact of a relay which is actuated by a micro switch strip provided along the frame edge of the associated window via a control apparatus so that the motor current can be respectively switched off or reversed in the opposite direction only when an object is trapped between the frame edge and the window edge but not however during an undisturbed closing operation.For this purpose it is in particular envisaged that the micro switch strip is attached at the interior side of the window frame directly alongside the line where the window edge meets the edge of t he frame. The micro switch strip thus responds to pressure operating in the closure direction. In accordance with the invention the micro switch strip thus does not lie directly facing the edge of the slidable window but rather at a distance to the side of this edge such that the edge of the window which contacts its abutment surface on the frame of the window opening does not itself result in contact between the contacts of the micro switch strip but rather only an object, for example a hand or a head which becomes trapped between the window edge and the edge of the frame. The arrangement of the micro switch strip at the interior side of the frame thus takes account of the fact that trapped body parts,extend into the dangerous region from the interior of the vehicle.An arrangement is preferred in which the relay has a break or switch over contact for each motor circuit and the frame edge of each sliding window has a micro switch strip with the micro switch strips respectively connected in parallel to the control apparatus. Thus for all the motor circuits only a single relay with several contacts is required which represents a very economical solution.One particularly favoured practical arrangement which is economical to manufacture is characterized in that the micro switch strip comprises two thin sheet metal steel strips which form respective electrodes of a switch and which are arranged parallel to one another and spaced apart by separating insulating strips which are arranged between them at their margins and which have a transverse spacing which allows contact between the electrodes. In accordance with a further particularly advantageous embodiment it is envisaged that the micro switch strip comprises a coil spring,which forms the one electrode and is arranged in an elongate insulating carrier,and a conductive silicon rubber strip which forms the other electrode and which extends parallel to the coil spring and is spaced therefrom. In this case the silicon rubber strip preferably extends in arch like form over the coil spring. Both of the afore mentioned embodiments of the micro switch strip are housed in rubber sections or profiles which are sealed against the ingress of water at their ends. Ifthe invention is applied to a vehicle window which enters into a sealing slot on closing then,inaccordance with the invention,the micro switch strip is arranged alongside the entry end of the slot and the distance from the end of the slot should in turn be chosen so that during the normal closing operation the micro switch strip does not respond but rather only responds when an object becomes trapped.The invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which are shownFig. 1 a schematic partially perspective illustration of a motorised actuation apparatus for the opening and closing of sliding vehicle windows showing two different embodiments of the micro switch strip,Fig. 2 an internal view of a vehicle door with motorised vertically sliding window and a micro switch strip, Fig. 3 a cross section of the door frame in the vicinity of the sealing slot for the vertically adjustable sliding window pane. andFig. 4 a schematic illustration of a further switch over relay suitable for the motorised actuation apparatus of the preceding figures.Fig. 5 a block diagram on one suitable form of control apparatus for use with the embodiment of,Figs. 1 4,As seen in Fig. 2 a micro switch strip 19 extends along the window frame or frame edge 16 of the window opening 35 of a vehicle door 36 such that the window edge or closure edge 18 of a motorised vertically adjustable window 11 passes the micro switch strip 19 on closing of 3 the Figs 3 illustrates in greater detail how.the micro switch strip 19 in accordance with the invention is arranged relative to the movenient path of the edge 18 of the window 11. In accordance with Fig. 3 the door frame 37 has at its lower side an elongate entry slot 30 which is closed in the illustrated manner by an elastic sealing material 38. The sealing material has continuations 38 , 38 which extend partially around the door frame 37 outside of the slot 30. Motorised raising of the side window 11 results in the window reaching the vicinity of the window frame 16 at the point 29. On raising the window still further it enters into the slot 30 which is dimensioned to be somewhat narrower than the thickness of the window pane. This results in a sealed engagement between the window 11 and the window frame 37.The micro switch strip 18 is arranged directly alongside the entry point 29 on the interior side of the elastic continuation 38 of the slot trim 38 and can be seen in enlarged broken away illustration at the top right hand side of Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 1 the micro switch strip 19 comprises two elongate thin spring steel sheet metal strips 20 which extend in the direction of the window frame and between which are arranged at the inner and outer sides narrow separating insulating strips 25. The strip 19 is illustrated in exploded view in Fig. 1, i.e. in the assembled condition the sheet metal strips 20 lie directly in contact with the separating strips 25. The sheet metal strips 20 are covered externally by elastic cover strips 39 and 40.On exerting a pressure in the direction of the arrow P inFig. 1 or Fig. 3 the two sheet metal strips 20 approach one another until they contact so that in this case an electrical contact is closed. In order to generate, as a result of this contact procedure, an electrical switching signal the two spring steel sheet metal. strips 20 which each form a respective electrode are connected via a pair of conductors 41 to a control apparatus 17, Fig. 1. The micro switch strips of other windows 12, 13, 14 can be likewise connected vi further pairs of conductors 42, 43, 44 to the control apparatus 17. The control apparatus 17, which will be later described in more detail is supplied with a DC voltage of 12 volts from the vehicle battery.On closing the electrical switch defined by the micro switch strip 19 the control apparatus 17 passes an electrical switching signal to a relay 15 via a pair of outlet conductors 45. The relay 15 contains a pair of contacts 21, 22, 23 and 24 for each window actuation motor circuit 31, 32, 33, 34. If the relay 15 is not activated the switch contact pairs 21, 24 are closed. These contacts connect the motors M1, M2, M3 andM4 for actuation of the windows 11, 12, 13, 14 via changeover switches 1, 2, 3, 4 with the vehicle battery 46. The windows 11, 12, 13, 14 are only schematically indicated inFig. 1. By changing over the switches 1 to 4 into one of the two switching positions, i.e. a window opening position and a window closing position an opening or closing current is passed to the motors.If however the relay 15 is excited by contact of t he electrodes of the micro switch strip then the switches 21,to 24 are interrupted and the motors M1 to M4 no longer receive any current i.e. are no longer energised. Further closing of the window is thus avoided if a hand, a head. or other object is trapped.In the embodiment of Fig. 4 the relay 15 is provided with change over contacts 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 in place of the break contacts 21 to 24 respectively, Thus on changing the state of an.. energisation of the relay 15 the direction of current through the individual motors is reversed so that on excitation of the relay 15 a window closing process is reversed to a window opening process.As seen at the top left hand side of Fig. 1 an alternative embodiment of a micro switch strip 19 is connected to the control apparatus 17 via the pair of conductors 42. This micro switch strip 19 consists of an insulating elongate carrier 26 which merely requires to be sufficiently flexible that it can be laid along a curved window frame 16. Inside the carrier there is placed, in the longitudinal direction of the carrier a coil spring 27 which is embedded at one side in the carrier 26 and which lies with its metallic surface bared at the opposite side. An arch like curved electrically conducting silicon rubber strip 28 is located spaced apart from the coil spring 27 and has both its longitudinal edges anchored in the insulating carrier strip or body 26. The curvature of the arch is so chosen that the strip 28 does not normally contact the coil spring 27.If however during the course of a closing operation an object becomes trapped in the window then a pressure P is exerted on the silicon rubber strip so that this is compressed and is brought into contact with the coil spring 27. Because the silicon rubber strip 28 is connected with one pole of the supply line 42 and the coil. spring 27 is connected to the other pole thereof contact of the strip 28 with the coil spring 27 generates a signal in the control apparatus 17 which causes the relay 15 to respond. The micro switch strip 19 is capable of being manufactured particularly econdmically. It is also particularly suitable for following the curvatures found in the vicinity of window frames.It is important that at least four independent micro switch strips 19 or 19 can be connected to the control apparatus 17.It is furthermore particularly advantageous if the two electrodes of each micro switch strip 19 or 19 are bridged by a protective resistor 47 such that a small residual control current flows through the conductors 41 to 44 even in the passive non activated condition of the micro switch strips. The control apparatus can then be so constructed in accordance with the initially mentioned Offenlegungsschriften that a stop or change over signal is initiated both when the passive control current is exceeded by closing of the contacts and also if this passive current is reduced in order to provide the driver with an indication if one of the micro strip switches 19, 19 is damaged.Damage would either lead to a raising or lowering of the passive control current.In principle all windows of a vehicle should be equipped with the same type of micro switch strip 19, 19 .Turning now to Fig . 5 there can be seen a circuit block diagram of the control apparatus 17. This apparatus which is already known per se and has been used in connection for example with the arrangements disclosed in the two initially mentioned German Offenlegungsschriften. The apparatus can for example be purchased from Erwin Sick GmbH of Germany under their designation Schaltgert SLE 04 . Equivalent apparatus is also available from Siemens GmbH of Germany.The basic function of the control apparatus 17 is, as previously mentioned, to energise the relay 15 when any one of the four micro switch strips responds to contact pressure. It is also desirable to recognise when the micro switch strips are inoperative either by way of a physical break or a short circuit.Clearly a physical break leads to raised or infinite resistance so that the passive current reduces, and a short circuit results in an increased current in similar fashion to an applied contact pressure. It is of course also necessary for such conditions to be recognised on initially switching on the apparatus.For this purpose the four micro switch strips 19,19 are applied in parallel to a combined Schmitt trigger and window comparator circuit which recognises any of the afore mentioned operating events by change of the passive current be it an increase or decrease. The control apparatus features a relay K1 which acts to energise or de energise the relay 15 so that the contacts 24 are either interrupted or changed over.Thus, following the occurrence of an operating event and after an initial switch in delay of 0.02 seconds the relay K1, which is normally engaged, disengages stopping or reversing the motors via the relay 15 and contacts 24.Providing the event is of a temporary nature the signal from the Schmitt trigger and window comparator will cease due for example to the removal of the trapped object and the relay K1 will once more engage.A green light emitting diode led indicates the provision of power to the control apparatus from the battery 46 and a red diode indicates that relay K1 has dropped out.
