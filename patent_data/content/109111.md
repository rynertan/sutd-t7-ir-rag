# Process for the production of a photographic colour image by image wise dye diffusion transfer.

## Abstract
A photographic colour diffusion transfer process com prising the steps 1 image wise photo exposing a photographic material which contains on a support at least one waterpermeable sil ver halide emulsion layer, the silver halide of which essentially consists of silver chloride, and in operative contact therewith at least one non diffusing ballasted dye or dye precursor which when contacted with an aqueous alkaline liquid remains immo bile in a waterpermeable colloid layer, and in reduced state is capable of releasing a dye s or dye precursor s , 2 treating the photographic material with an alkaline processing liquid in the presence of a silver halide developing agent, 3 maintaining said photographic material in contact with the alkaline processing liquid in the presence of said devel oping agent to release said dye or dye precursor in diffusible state and 4 transferring at least a portion of said released dye or dye precursor to a non light sensitive layer and carrying out the development in the presence of a substance providing io dide ions, increasing speed and reducing colour fog.
