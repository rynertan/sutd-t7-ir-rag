# Catalytic preparation of 2 halo 1 alkenes from unsaturated hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A 2 halo 1 alkene such as 2 chloro 1 propene is pre pared by contacting together, in the presence of a catalyst such as alumina , a a 1,2 diene such as propadiene and or a 1 alkyne such as propyne , with b a hydrogen halide such as HCl in the presence of at least 1,000 ppm water. The process of the invention provides unexpected selectivity for the desired product.
