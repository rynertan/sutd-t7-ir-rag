## Description
Herbicide antidote, production, use and compositions thereof This invention relates to a herbicide antidote, more particularly 2,2 dimethyl 3 dichloroacetyl 5 ethylsulfonylmethyl 1,3 oxazolidine, and to productior.. use and compositions thereof. A herbicide is a compound which controls or modifies plant growth, e.g. killing, retarding, defoliating, desiccating, regulating, stunting, tillering, stimulating and dwarfing. The term plant refers to all physical parts of a plant, including seeds, seedlings, saplings, roots, tubers, stems, stalks, foliage and fruits. Plant growth includes all phases of development from seed germination to natural or induced cessation or life. Herbicides are generally used to control or eradicate weed pests. They have gained a high degree of commercial success because it has been shown that such control may increase crop yield and reduce harvesting costs. The most popular methods of herbicide application include pre plant incorporation into the soil in furrow application to seeds and surrounding soil pre emergenc. surface treatment of speeded soil and post emergence treatment of the plant and soil. A manufacturer of herbicide generally recommends a range of application rates and concentrations calculated to maximize weed control. Generally, the range of rates varies from 0.01 to 50 pounds per acre from 0.0111 to 56 kilo grams per hectare K ha , and is usually from 0.1 to 25 pounds per acre froia 0.112 to 28 k a . The ter herbicidally effective amount refers to the amount of a horbicide which controls or modifies plant growth.The actual amount used depends upon several considerativr.s, including particular weed susceptibility and overall cost limitations. The most important factor influencing the usefulness of a given herbicide is its selectivity towards crops. In some cases, a beneficial crop is susceptible to the effects of the herbicide. In addition, certain herbicidal compounds are phytotoxic to some weed species but not to others. Th be effective, an herbicide must cause minimal damage preferably no damage to the beneficial crop while maximizing damage to weed species which plague that crop. To preserve the beneficial aspects of herbicide use and to minimize crop damage, many herbicide antidotes have been prepared. These antidotes reduce or eliminate damage to the crdp without substantially it airing the damaging effect of the herbicide on weed species See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,959,304, 3,989,503, 4,021,224 and 4,021,229 and Belgian Patent No. 846,894. The precise mechanism by which an antidote reduces herbicidal crop injury has not been established. An antidote compound may be a remedy, interferent, protectant, or antagonist. As used herein, ianti dote describes a compound which has the effect of establishing herbicide selectivity, i.e., continued herbicidal phytotoxicity to weed species and reduced or non phytotoxicity to cultivated crop species. The term antidotally effective amount 1 describes the amount of an antidote compound which, counteracts a phytotoxic response of a beneficial crop to an herbicide. Thiocarbamate herbicides are particularly effective in the control of grassy, type weeds which interfere with the cultivation of a wide variety of crops, e.g., barley, corn, cotton, lentils, peanuts, peas, potatoes, soybeans, spinach, tobacco and tomatoes. Frequently the effective use of these herbicides requires the addition of an antidote compound. Description of the Invention It has now been discovered that 2,2dimethyl 3 dichloro acetyl 5 ethylsulfonylmethyl l,3 oxazolidine is an effective antidote for the protection of a variety of crops from thiocarbamate herbicide injury.This compound has the following formula EMI3.1 This invention also embodies a two part herbicidal system comprised of a an herbicidally effective amount of a thiocarbamate compound of the formula EMI3.2 in which R1 is alkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms, inclusive R2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms, inclusive and cyclohexyl or R1 and R2 form indistinguishable parts of a single aLkylene ring having 4 10 carbon atoms, inclusive and R3 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms, inclusive haloalkyl wherein halo is selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine and iodine and alkyl has 1 6 carbon atoms, inclusive alkenyl having 2 6 carbon atoms, inclusive halo alkenyl wherein halo is selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine and iodine and alkenyl has 2 6 carbon atoms, inclusive benzyl and halo substituted benzyl, wherein halo is selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine and iodine and b an non phytotoxic antidotally effective amount of a com pound of the formulaEMI3.3 By way of exemplification, the active thiocarbamate herbicides employed in the invention may include S ethyl N,N dipropyl thiocarbamate, S ethyl N,N diisobutyl thiocarbamate, S propyl N,N dipropyl thiocarbamate, S propyl N,N butylethylthiocarbamate, S 2,3,3 tri chloroallyl N,Ndiisopropyl thiocarbamate, S ethyl N ethyl N cydlohexyl thiocarbamate, S ethyl hexahydro lH azepine l carbothioate, isopropyl hexahydro 1,4 azepine 1 carbothioate, S benzyl N,N disec butylthiolcarbamate,S 4 chlorobenzyl N,N diethyl thiolcarbamate and combinations thereof. This invention also includes the method of establishing herbicidal selectivity which comprises applying to the locus where protection is desired an antidotally effective amount of a compound of the formulaEMI4.1 The locus where selectivity is desired may include soil, seeds, seedlings, and vegetation.Preparation The thiocarbamates of the present composition are either commercially available or can be prepared by the procedures described in U.S Patent Nos. 2,913,327 2,93,747 3,133,947 3,185,720 and 3,198,786. The 2,2 dimethyl 3 dichloroacetyl 5 ethylsulfonylmethyl 1,3 oxozolidine compound of the present invention can be prepared according to the follow procedure.Preparation of 2, 2dlmethyl 3 dichioroacetyl 5 ethylsulfonylmethyl 1,3 oxazolidine A solution containing 8.3 grams g 0.041 mole, 85 acid of m chloroperbenzoic acid in 100 milliliters ml of dichloromethane was prepared and warmed to 300C. Five and six tenths g of 2,2 dimethyl 3 dichloroacetyl 5 ethylthiomethyl oxazolidino in 10 ml of dichloromethane was added to the solution and the temperature rose to reflux. The mixture was refluxed for an hour, cooled to 5 C and filtered. The filtrate was washed three times with a sodiun bicarbonate solution, once with water and once with a saturated sodium chloride solution.The filtrate was dried and the solvent was removed to leave a white solid which was titurated with hexane and dried. Yield was 4.1 g of 2,2 dimethyl 3 dchloroacetyl 5 ethylsulfonylmethyl 1,3 oxazolidine. m. p. 121 126 C. Structure was confirmed by infrared spectrum.Testing Stock solutions of the herbicides were prepared by diluting the requisite amount of each herbicide in water.

PPI Pre plant incorporation The antidote solutions were applied to the soil either by infurrow surface application, or by pre plant incorporation. In all cases of pre plant incorporation, the antidote was tank mixed with the herbicide prior to incorporation into the soil. For in furrow application, a one pint 473 cubic centimeter cc sample of soil containing the previously incorporated herbicide was removed and retained from each planting flat. After leveling and furrowing the soil, seeds of the crop or weed species were planted 1 2 inch deep 1.27 centimeter . Each flat was divided in half by a wooden barrier. A stock solution of the antidote was atomized directly onto the exposed seeds and soil in the open furrow on one side of the bar rier.The seeds in the entire flat were then covered with the previously removed soil. The antidotally untreated sections of flats were compared for observed differences which would indicate lateral movement of the antidote through the soil. control flats contained crops treated with herbicide only. All flats were placed on greenhouse benches where temperature was maintained between 70 and 900F 21.1 to 32.2 C . The flats were watered by sprinkling as needed to assure good plant growth. All of the soil used in the tests described herein was loamy sand soil treated with 50 parts per million ppm each of a commercially available fungicide, N trichloromethyl thio 4 cyclohexene 1,2 dicar boximide, and 18 18 18 fertilizer, which contains 18 by weight equivalent each of nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide, and potassiun oxide. Injury ratings were taken four weeks after application of the antidote. The effectiveness of the antidote was determined by visual comparison of crop injury which occurred in the test flats to that which occurred in the control flats. The treated crops initially screened for herbicidal injury were milo, wheat, cotton, rice, barley, corn and soybeans. The compound was tested on the weed species watergrass Echinochloa crusgalli , foxtail Setaria viridis and shattercane Sorghum bicolor .

Use of this compound did not result in a reduction of herbicidal injury to weeds. Formulations A formulation is the incorporation of a formulant in a form which is directly usable on crops and weeds. As defined herein a formu lant is the material which is to be formulated. The formulant may be either an antidote compound alone or an herbicide and antidote composition. The purpose of the formulation is to apply the formulant to the locus where it is desired to establish herbicidal selectivity by a corwen ient method. The locus may include soil, seeds, seedlings and vegetation. he formulations are commonly dusts, wettable powders, granules solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. Dusts are free flowing powder compositions containing the formu lant impregnated on a particulate carrier. The particle size of the carriers is usually in the approximate range of 30 to 50 microns. Examples of suitable carriers are talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, and pyrophyllite. The composition generally contains up to 50 of formulant. Anti caking and anti static agents may also be added. Dusts may be applied by spraying from boom and hand sprayers on airplanes. Wettable powders are finely divided compositions comprising a particulate carrier impregnated with the formulant and additionally containing one or more surface active agents. The surface active agent promotes rapid dispersion of the powder in an aqueous medium to form stable, sprayable suspensions. A wide variety of surface active agents can be used, for example, long chain fatty alcohols and alkali metal salts of the sulfated fatty alcohols salts of sulfonic acid esters of long chain fatty acids and polyhydric alcohols, in which the alcohol groups are free, omega substituted polyethylene glycols of relatively long chain length. A list of surface active agents suitable for use in agriculture formulations can be found in Wade Van Valkenburg, Pesticide Formulations parcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y., 1973 at pages 79 811. Granules comprise the formulant impregnated on a particulate inert carrier having a particle size of about 1 to 2 millimeters rim in diameter. The granules can be made by spraying a solution of the formulant in a volatile solvent onto the granular carrier. Examples of suitable carriers for the preparation of granules include clay, vermiculite, sawdust, and granular carbon. Emulsifiable concentrates consist of an oil solution of the formulant plus an emulsifying agent. Prior to use the concentrate is diluted with water to form a suspended emulsion of oil droplets. The emulsifiers used are usually a mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants. Other additives, such as suspending agents and thickeners, may be included in the emulsifiable concentrate. When the formulant is an antidote and herbicide composition, the proportion of antidote compound to herbicide compound generally ranges from approximately 0.001 to 30 parts by weight of the antidote compound per weight of the herbicide compound. Formulations generally contain several additives in addition to the formulant and carrier or agent. Among these are inert ingredients, diluent carriers, organic solvents, water, oil and water, water in oil emulsions, carriers of dusts and granules, and surface active wetting, dispersing and emulsifying agents. Fertilizers, e.g., ammonium nitrate, urea and superphosphate, may be included. Aids to rooting and growth, e.g., compost, manure, humus and sand, may also be included. Alternatively, the antidote compounds and herbicide and antidote compositions of this invention can be applied to a crop by addition of the formulant to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated.This method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the water is absorbed. As another alternative, the formulant can be applied to the soil in the form of a solution in a suitable solvent. Solvents frequently used in these formulations include kerosene, fuel oil, xylene, petroleum fractions with boiling ranges above xylene and aromatic petroleum fractions rich in methylated naphthalenes. Liquid solutions, like dusts, may be applied by spraying from boom and hand sprayers on airplanes.
