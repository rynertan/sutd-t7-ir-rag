# Tracking apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracking apparatus having an auto tracking servo sys tem which is constructed to allow a plurality of video heads to be automatically on track by means of mechanical deviations of electric mechanical conversion elements so that a video signal is reproduced from a magnetic tape on which said video signal of a given unit length is recorded as a recorded track having the predetermined inclination with respect to the lengthwise direction of said magnetic tape, said tracking ap paratus being characterized in that a control means is pro vided which, when at least one of said video heads scans an adjacent track other than a desired one, controls said plurality of video heads to scan the desired track by means of positional information and head discrimination information of said video heads.
