# Method of and apparatus for making airlaid articles.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for making airlaid articles such as discrete absorbent cores for catamenial napkins and disposable diapers and the like. Apparatus embodying the invention preferably comprises a laydown drum having a plurality of formation cavities having foraminous bottom walls, which cavities are circumferentially spaced around the perimeter of the drum. The apparatus also preferably includes means for directing a high velocity stream of air entrained matter such as, for example, fibers or particu late matter, substantially radially towards a relatively short circumferential span of the perimeter of the drum and a hood having sufficient circumferential span of the drum to enable excess entrainment air to be drawn by vacuum through the foraminous bottom walls of substantially empty cavities, and to enable recirculation of the excess scarfed fibers. The method preferably includes overfilling the cavi ties scarfing and recycling the excess and compacting the deposited mass of fibers to impart structural integrity to the mass of fibers to dimensionally define the articles prior to removing the articles from their respective formation cavi ties.
