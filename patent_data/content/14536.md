# A circular inflatable dinghy.

## Abstract
To simplify the manipulation of a dinghy between water and a storage location above high water mark, the dinghy is constructed so as to be circular when viewed in plan and is provided with pivotal means 14 , such as a frusto conical buoyant body 30 having a bore 29 , for receiving a handle 22 whereby the dinghy can be rolled on its outer peripheral edge after the manner of a wheel, whilst being pushed, pulled and or controlled by means of the handle. In the illustrated case, the handle is in the form of a pole inserted by one end into the socket means 14 and retained therein by rollers 33 , on radial stubs 31 , engaging with the undersurface of the dinghy floor. Other means, such as a peg loaded by a leaf spring engaging into a circumferential groove around the pole, may be provided for retaining the pole. Accessories for the dinghy, provisions and so on, can be taken along with the dinghy by means of a receptacle not illustrated hung from the handle 22 . An alternative form of handle arrangement may be in the form of a yoke providing arms which extend along each side of the dinghy and have respective pivot pegs engaging into the socket means from opposite ends thereof. Such an arrangement may be adapted for coupling to the towing hitch of a vehicle.
