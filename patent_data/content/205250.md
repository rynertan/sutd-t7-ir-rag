# Improvements in subsurface device actuators.

## Abstract
A subsurface valve actuator combination 13 for well production tubing is described. The valve is urged to closed position but held open by a battery operated latch of the actuator. A receiver relay 72 in the battery actuator circuit maintains a switch 74 closed to permit the latch to be ener gized as long as the receiver relay receives an electromagne tic signal transmitted from the earth s surface. The latch is deenergized upon interruption of the signal and or if the bat tery power is insufficient to energize the same.
