# Method of and apparatus for controlling motor driven let off and take up system for looms.

## Abstract
Motor driven let off and take up motions in a loom are controlled by controlling the rotation of a motor for driving warp yarns with a tention control system operating in response to a signal indicative of a target tension and a feedback input signal indicative of an actual tension of the object during a normal operation of the loom, and controll ing the rotation of the motor with a feedforward control system during a transient operation of the loom, the feedforward control system storing operation patterns of directions, and speeds of rotation and angular displacement of the motor for respective operation modes and weaving conditions of the loom. At the time of the transient operation, an operating condition of the loom is detected, an appropri ate operation pattern is read from the feedforward control system based on the detected operation mode, and the read operation pattern is applied as a control signal to a drive control system for the motor.
