# Method for processing color photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A method for processing a color photographic light sen sitive material comprising subjecting an exposed silver halide color photographic light sensitive material to color develop ment processing then to bleach processing and fixing pro cessing separately, wherein a bath of the bleach processing contains a at least one bleach accelerating agent selected from a compound having a mercapto group or a disulfide bond, a thiazolidine derivative and an isothiourea derivative and b at least one compound represented by the following general for mula I a or I b According to the method of the present invention, color photographic images having good quality can be obtained without the formation of precipitate in a bleaching bath con taining the bleach accelerating agent, even when color photo graphic light sensitive materials are continuously processed.
