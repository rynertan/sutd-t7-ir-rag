# IMAGE TRANSFER PHOTOGRAPHIC ELEMENT COMPRISING A POSITIVE REDOX DYE RELEASER AND HAVING IMPROVED POST PROCESS D MIN STABILITY

## Abstract
A photographic element is described employing positive working redox dye releasers, wherein the element comprises an oxidant which is located between an image receiving layer on the support and the photosensitive portion thereof. The oxidant has an electrode potential of from 200 mV up to 1200 mV versus a saturated calomel electrode at a pH of 5 to 6. After processing, the oxidant reacts with an electron transfer agent to prevent it from reacting with the dye releaser which would otherwise cause further dye release. The reduced form of the oxidant is then substantially incap able of reducing the positive working redox dye releaser. D
