# SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR.

## Abstract
A system for controlling a synchronous motor is pro vided with a detector 112 detecting the rotational angle of a synchronous motor 101 , and a control circuit 108 which generates a sine value corresponding to the rotational angle detected by the detector 112 and multiples an effective value current command by that sine value, a multiplication output from the control circuit 108 being applied as a current command value to an armature winding of the synchronous motor 101 . In this case, the control circuit 108 is adapted to compensate for the detected rotational angle by the actual velocity of the synchronous motor 101 . or by a command velocity given to the synchronous motor.
