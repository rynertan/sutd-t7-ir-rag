## Description
PROCESS FOR RECOVERING 2,3,5,6 TETRACHLOROPYRIDINE This invention is directed to a process for recoveing substantially pure 2,315,6 tetrachloropyridine from mixtures of chlorinated pyridines. Highly chlorinated pyridine compounds, such as 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridlne, are known to be useful as pesticides or as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds having pesticidal properties. The various processes used to prepare chlorinated pyridines and especially 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine have generally resulted in producing product mixes containing many chlorinated compounds including 2,3,4,5 and 2,3,4,6tetrachloropyridine, the two position isomers of the desired 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine. It has been particularly difficult to separate 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine from its two position isomers by conventional economical techniques such as distillation since the boiling points of these three materials are so close.It has therefore been necessary to resort to more costly, difficult and time consuming procedures of selective crystallization and multistage and or multiplate distillation. It has now been found that both 2,3,4,5 and 2,3,4,6 tetrachloropyridine are converted to pentachloropyridine at a much more rapid rate than 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine when they are chlorinated in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Because of this difference in reaction rates, both 2,3,4,5 and 2,3,4,6 tetrachloropyridine can be substantially converted to pentachloropyridine prior to substantial conversion of any 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine which might be in admixture with the above isomers. The separation of 2,3,5, 6 tetrachloropyridine from pentachloropyridine is a rather easy procedure. Nore particularly, it has been found that substantially pure 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine can be recovered from a first mixture containing initially 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine, pentachloropyridine and at least one of 2, 3,4,5 tetrachloropyridine and 2,3,4,6 tetrachloropyridine and no more than minor amounts, if any, of monochloropyridires, 3,5 dichloropyridine, 2,3,5, trichloropyridine and 2,3,6 trichloropyridine and no other chloropyridine compounds. The present process comprises the steps of a reacting by contacting a first mixture of chlorinated pyridines with chlorine in the presence of a Lewis acid catalystthereby to obtain a second mixture of chlorinated pyridines consisting essentially of 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine, and b recovering the 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine from the second mixture. There are several commercially significant advantages of the present process over prior art procedures. First, the process of the invention results in a mixture consisting essentially of symmetrical tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine which is easily separated by conventional techniques e.g., distillation .Second, pentachloropyridine is known to be a starting material for use in reductive reactions leading to tetrachloropyridines and the pentachloropyridine produced in the present process can be recovered and recycled to generate additional symmetrical tetrachloropyridine.Third, the present process is a straightforward facile process which obviates the need of expensive, sophisticated distillation apparatus or selective crystallization apparatus to recover symmetrical tetrachloropyridine from a mixture of close boiling position isomers of tetrachloropyridine or a mixture of polychlorinated pyridines. Significant capital savings as well as reduced operating expenditures are thus substantially achieved. These and other advantages will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of manufacturing symmetrical tetrachloropyridine. Normally, commercial routes of producing symmetrical tetrachloropyridine result in a mixture of tri , tetra and pentachloropyridines. All of these mixtures normally melt at elevated temperatures e.g., 90 C 1250C and the molten mixture is used as the reaction medium in the present process. Examples of Lewis acids which can be employed in the present process include, o phosphoric acid, boron trifluoride, aluminum chloride, aluminum oxychloride, chromium trichloride, ferric chloride, ruthenium chloride, and the corresponding bromides, aluminum oxide, ferric oxide, and ferric acetylacetonate. The catalyst, which is normally a solid can be employed as such unsupported or the catalyst can be supported on a carrier. Representative carriers include, for example, molecular sieves, gamma alumina, silica, silica gel, silica alumina, and graphite. It has been observed that Lewis acids in which the metal or cationic portion of the compound has an oxidation state of plus 3 or more usually 3 or 5 as the predominant configuration e.g. Fe 3 are normally catalysts in the present process. Such compounds are considered to be strong Lewis acids. The preferred compounds are Lewis acids which are covalent metal halides and the most preferred catalysts are ferric chloride and aluminum chloride.The covalent metal halides can be used per se which is the desired embodiment or they can be generated in situ by adding the metal to the reaction mixture. For example, iron or aluminum can be added to the reaction mixture and ferric chloride and aluminum chloride will be generated in situ. The catalysts are used in amounts of up Lo 10 weight percent, based on the weight of the chloropyridine reactant mixture. Preferably, however, the catalyst is included in amounts of from 0.05 to 0.5 weight percent. The catalysts are quite effective and generally the lesser amount is satisfactory and facilitates removal of the catalyst at the end of the reaction. The reaction may be conducted by contacting the chloropyridine mixtures with chlorine in the presence of the catalyst by a slurry technique or by contacting the mixture with the catalyst over a static bed or a fluidized bed of the catalyst. The process may be conducted in a batchwise manner, a continuous manner or a cyclic batch manner in which the pentachloropyridine and symmetrical tetrachloropyridine are removed leaving the catalyst in a distillation residue or in a quantity of the reaction mixture in the reaction vessel and fresh reactants then merely introduced into the reaction vessel. In this manner, the catalyst is recovered and re used. The reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures normally above the melting point of the chloropyridine mixture.Desirable rates of reaction have been achieved at temperatures of from 1500C to 3000C although somewhat higher or lower temperatures could be used, if desired. Preferred rates of reaction have been observed at temperatures of from 2000C to 2500C. The reaction can be conducted at atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure e.g., 15 75 psig 2 6 atm or higher but superatmospheric pressures are normally desired. As is well known, chlorine is a gas and the solubility of chlorine in the chloropyridine mixtures is enhanced by use OI superatmospheric pressures. This superatmospheric pressure may be provided with chlorine or an inert gas e.g., nitrogen or HC1 but is normally provided by chlorine gas. The process may be conducted in the presence of an inert solvent, if desired, but is preferably conducted neat. Suitable inert solvents include chlorinated hydrocarbons such as for example methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. The following examples will further illustrate the invention.Experimental The following experiments were conducted in a glass reaction vessel at atmospheric pressure and in a high pressure stainless steel autoclave at elevated pressures. The analysis of the reaction mixture and end products was accomplished by vapor phase chromatography. Examples 1 5 A mixture of chlorinated pyridines was charged to an externally heated glass reactor vessel equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser and a glass sparger and the mixture heated until molten. The mixture of chloropyridines included some or all of the following compounds in various amounts 3,5 Dichloropyridine, 2,3,5 trichloropyridine, 2,3,6 trichloropyridine, pentachloropyridine and the three position isomers of tetrachloropyridine. Ferric chloride was added to this molten mixture with stirring.The molten mixture was then heated to approximately 2000C and chlorine was sparged into the reaction mixture. The course of the reaction was followed by taking analytical samples of the reaction mixture from time to time and following the disappearance of the undesirable isomers in the gas chromatograph.The data from these examples runs are summarized in Table I below.

The autoclave was subsequently sealed, heated to reaction temperature, and pressurized with a pad of chlorine entering through a top valve. Once pressurized, chlorine gas was then continuously sparged through the reaction mixture with stirring and analytical samples taken during the course of the reaction.

The negative numbers under percent conversion in Table II means that that particular isomer was being produced during the course of the reaction while the positive numbers, on the other hand, indicate that that particular isomer was being consumed during the course of the reaction and leading to reduced amounts of that material in the final product. In the above Runs, the small amount of 3,5 dichloropyridine present not listed in the feed makeup was converted to 2,3,5 trichloropyridine which in turn was converted to 2,3,4,5 , and 2,3,5,6 tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine. The 2,3, 6 trichloropyridine also not listed as part of the feed makeup was converted to 2,3,5, 6 tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine.Additional reaction time would increase pentachloropyridine production and give substantially complete chlorination of 2,3, 5 trichloropyridine, 2,3,4,5 and 2,3,4,6 tetrachloropyridine. The dashes in Table II means that none of that particular isomer was present in the final reaction product. These reaction mixtures were likewise resolved into pentachloropyridine and symmetrical tetrachloropyridine using distillative techniques. The above examples show that the present process is very effective in resolving a complex mixture of chlorinated pyridines into a mixture consisting essentially of pentachloropyridine and symmetrical tetrachloropyridine which are easily resolved by conventional techniques. Various catalysts have been used in these examples and various other process parameters have been illustrated. Other catalysts and or process parameters can be varied according to the above teaching.
