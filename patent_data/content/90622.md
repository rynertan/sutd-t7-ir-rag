## Description
SEATS FOR CHAIRS.This invention relates to seats for chairs, particularly small chairs. Small chairs, as that term is used herein, are chairs having a limited seating area just adequate to seat adults properly with little or no spare space. there are many types of small chairs. Each type usually has its own characteristics and structure, and the seat size or conventional width varies within a narrow rr r Je. For example, small chairs may be foldable to stackable with seats substantially 38.5 cm wide, dining chairs are substantially 43.0 cm along their front edges, arm chairs substantially 53.5 cm along their front edges and slung chairs substantially 41.0 cm.Most small chairs presently in general use that have been mass produced are relatively uncomfortable.Usually they are constructed without spring or elastic elements and utilise plywood, pressboard or a metal base having a thickness that will depend upcn te intended use of the chair. rv,reTha11e padding over the chair seat or base is bt one att pt to overcome the pressure to which the chair oc learr will be subjected at the ischial tuberosities seat bones Ev the use of a thickness of 8 cmsof uretnane foam cushiuning is insufficient to reduce significantly the weight of the trunk on the ischial tuberosities since the urethane foam innately is unable to den enough support at partial compressionund the tocks to take on a significant portion of the load.Furthermore, such padding, even when as much as 8cms thick, bottoms out , especially when subjected to repeated loadings, and is unsatisfactory generally for distributing and supporting the occupant s load. Thick padding presses on the under thigh surfaces of the occupant and reduces blood circulation in the thighs tending to make seating uncomfortable and sometimes painful, in addition to the aforementioned high pressure effects under the ischial tuberosities.British Patent No. 1539681 is illustrative of applicant s earlier proposal to overcome these problems. The specification of the patent incorporates many of the ranges of measurements in adults which permitted a dependable average to be obtained of the distance between the ischial tuberosities. The distance was found to vary very little, 95 of adults measured lying within a range of from 12.2 cm to 14.2 cm, and averaging 13.2 cm.Other chair seats that exhibit supporting means are shown in the specifications of British Patent No.343628 Holland and U.S. Patent No. 1496634 Hettinger.Neither of the previous proposais, the subject of the above mentioned patent specifications, recognises and takes account of the fact that the ischial tuberosities depend some distance below the compressed buttocks in the majority of adults. It is an object of the present invention to accommodate fully the depending ischial tuberosities and to reduce but not eliminate the load on them and, at the same time, to accommodate more comfortably the laterally extending thigh bones, these being the next level of skeletal support.According to the present invention, there is provided a seat for a chair, narrow enough that an adult human occupant would tend to sit centrally between the two sides of the seat, and comprising a frame having four sides surrounding a central opening, with an inner pair and an outer pair of elastically extensible members, in tension when the seat is in use, spanning the same opposite sides of the frame, both the inner and the outer pair being constituted by a left side member and a right side member equidistant from a front to rear centre line of the seat, the members of the inner pair being spaced apart a distance of between 12 and 15cm at locations spaced from one of said opposite sides by a distance of from 12.5cm to 20cm said one opposite side being intended to be the rear edge of the seat so that, in use, the ischial tuberosities of the majority of adult occupants of the chair are disposed above and supported by the inner pair of extensible members, the members of the outer pair of extensible members being spaced apart more widely than the members of the inner pair thereby to support the thigh bones of an occupant of the seat whose ischial tuberosities are supported by the inner pair of extensible members, wherein the extensible members of the inner pair are chosen to be softer than those of the outer pair, that is to say, they are constructed and arranged in such a way that they suffer a greater downward movement at the momerlt that the seat is put to use than do the extensible members of the outer pair. Even where the outer pair of extensible members are depressed very little indeed, nevertheless they do conform or hammock significantly under the thigh bones, that is to say, the necks of the femurs, of the occupant of the seat. The present invention is based upon anthropometric, anatomical and physiological data, some of which is new.The inventor discovered that the two ischial tuberosities extend 4.5 cm 0.75 cm below the compressed buttocks when a person is in a sitting position. Thus when a person sits on an unyielding surface, the ischial tuberosities contact it firmly and carry the full weight of the trunk under their very limited area. Although the rest of the buttocks is in contact with the seating surface, because they are soft tissue, they are not compressed sufficiently to bear any significant portion of the trunk load.Pressures on the ischial tuberosities can exceed 7x104 Kg mÃª, producing pain and leading to movements such as squirming and knee crossing in order to shift the contact area somewhat. Inattention and distraction are the frequent consequence of such discomfort.The purpose of foam cushioning, padding, and springing alone or in combination is to spread the load by permitting the ischial tuberosities to sink more deeply, and for the buttocks to become further compressed against the thigh bones and to share the weight of the head, arms and trunk. Whereas 10 cm thick, firm urethane foam, or foam over springs, can rod w tORfortRble F t, s S type Df S.t UZ requires considerable depth and furniture of substantial proportions. Most utilitarian seating such as office chairs, dinette sets, folding chairs, stacking chairs and auditorium seating is much lighter and much less expensive and usually affords a maximum depth of only 5 cm to cushion the chair occupant.The seats of various chairs of the latter sort vary from a flat plywood or metal panel without upholstering to somewhat concave configurations with or without upholstering and to a base with a very few cms of urethane foam or some other type of padding.In view of the anatomical configuration mentioned heretofore, especially the sharp obtrusion of the ischial tuberosities, clearly it is most difficult to achieve a comfortable spreading of the sitting load in such limited depth. The most common approach, to provide a very few cms of urethane foam over a hard platform, typically becomes uncomfortable within a few minutes. Foam has a tendency, as indicated above, to pack and bottom out under load. The foam under the seat bones packs down very rapidly, whereas the partially compressed foam under the buttocks provides miniscule support. Thus, the occupant quickly finds himself with almost the same discomfort as if the foam were not present. Although there is considerable variation in individuR regarding what particular load distribution is most comfortable. when sitting, as well as the added factors of the height of the seat, the type of back support, if any, and whether arm rests are employed, it has been found that a sense of comfort is achieved when approximately one third of the trunk load is carried by the two ischial tuberosities, and about two thirds of the load is distributed over the rest of the buttocks and under the thighs.The present invention provides a deceptively simple way to produce a contour seat which spreads the load of the trunk, head and arms so that a high sense of comfort is attained and yet only the two extensible members under the ischial tuberosities need move downwardly by any great amount. This is preferably achieved by employing two elastic straps or springs typically having a width of about 5 cms and centered about 13.2 cms apart the ischial tuberosity separation to within plus or minus 1 cm in 95 of the adult population , in a seat which is sufficiently narrow to constrain the sitting location of the occupant, causing his ischial tuberosities to land on the elastic straps or springs and depress them by a distance of from 3.75 to 5.25 cm more than the depression of the two firmer members exterior to the two inner springs, again typically having a width of around 5 cms, which receive and compress the buttocks and preferably suffer only a very small depression of their own under the laterally extending portion of the thigh bones.The outer pair of supports, centered about 28 to 33 cms apart and preferably arranged such that there is a gap of about 2.5 cm between each outer support and the adjacent inner support may be, for example, two firm elastic webbing strips or firm spring strips that conform somewhat to the buttocks but depress very little. At this point, with the inner supports depressed as stated, the support provided by the two inner and softer spring strands will equal about one third of the total load on the seat, and the support provided by the outer platform comprising the very firm spring strands or webbing plus the framing structure in the front and sides will provide about two thirds of the support of the load on the seat.The width of the opening in the frame will therefore generally be in a range of from 33 td 48 cms.Thus, the invention provides, in minimal and very economical form, a seat contoured to the anatomy of the occupant, providing the sensation of full comfort and springiness, yet requiring a depth of only 2 to 5 cm of padding material overlying the extensible members.The specific resilience or spring rate of the two inner strands, when made from short pieces of sinuous springs of standard format and slight arc, that develops the correct pressure after being depressed by the ischial tuberosities, can be achieved with the use of 10 or 11 gauge spring wire. The outer members can be 8 gauge sinuous springs, these providing a very firm format.The overall result, of course, varies with the amount of padding and the manner in which the seat is upholstered. However, it has been found that there is enough leeway in human perception to provide a sense of comfort and springiness to occupants of either sex having a full range of anatomical proportions. There is a definite range of parameters, and te inner strands must be located under the ischial tuberosities to be fully effective and assume the full contour.This is a marked departure from those prior proposals with random sized frames and where spring supports for the upholstering are inserted simply to fill the void or space within the frame exterior.An example of a seat construction according to the present invention, which is adapted to accommodate and support the ischial tuberosities at a lower level than the rest of the buttocks and thighs, will now be given in the following description, to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a transverse sectional view of a generalised spring seat embodying the invention, and including a partial skeletal view of a seated occupant illustrating the significant pelvic sitting position on the seat Fig. 2 is a top plan view of a first embodiment of the spring seat Fig. 3 is a top plan view of a second embodiment of the spring seat Fig. 4 is a side view of a chair having a seat with a portion removed therefrom illustrating one construction for retaining the spring seat andFig. 5 is an underside plan view of a third embodiment of the spring seat.Referring to Fig. 1, there is illustrated, in outline form, the lower torso 10 of a seated person occupying a spring seat 11 in which the pelvic area 12 is shown with the ischial tuberosities 13 and 14 positioned on an inner pair of extensible bands 15 in tension in a loaded and depressed condition while an outer pair of stiffer extensible bands 16 and 17 are in tension and support the occupant s thigh bones 23 with the outer bands being spaced by a gap of 2.5 cm from the sides 19 and 20 of the frame of the seat 11 and by a gap of similar size from the adjacent edges of the inner bands 15. Each pair of bands consists of a left hand member and a right hand member located equidistant from a front to rear centre line of the seat. The four members are mutually parallel.The sacrum 21 and the coccyx 22 are positioned centrally of the ischial tuberosities or seat bones as part of the pelvic girdle with the neck of the femur 23 being shown also in outline form in juxtaposition to the ischial tuberosities and above the fleshy buttocks 18 that will be supported on the bands 16 and 17. The spacing between the centre lines of the pair of inner bands 15 is 13.2 cms so as to accord with the spacing between the ischial tuberosities in the greater majority of adults, as described hereinbefore.In Fig. 2, the perimeter of the seat frame 24 comprises a front rail 25, a rear rail 26 and a pair of side rails 27 suitable joined together to provide a central opening 28 which is spanned by an inner pair of transverseiy extending and spaced apart extensible sinuous bands otherwise called springs 29 and 30 that are securely fastened to the front and rear rails 25 and 26 of the seat frame 24 by suitable spring clips 31 and 32, which are themselves securely fastened to the seat frame by suitable fastening members. The inner bands 29 and 30 are spaced apart as described with reference to Fig. 1 thereby to receive and support thereon the ischial tuberosities as shown in Fig. 1.An outer pair of laterally spaced extensible sinuous bands otherwise called springs 33 and 34 are positioned and supported laterally from the bands 29 and 30 and are secured in position by means of the spring clips 35 and 36 at the spring ends in a conventional manner and secured to the seat frame by suitable fastening members such as screws, rivets or bolts . Each of the sinuous springs 29, 30, 33 and 34 is continuous from the front to the rear of the seat although only portions are shown, for economy of illustration. The two inner bands 29 and 30 are soft relative to the outer bands, to an extent such that they support approximately one third of the seated occupant s total load. The outer bands 33 and 34 are relatively firm, such that they, together with the rigid side, front and rear rails, support approximately two thirds of the occupant s load on the seat.The specific resilience or spring rate of the two inner bands 29 and 30 may be made from short sections of sinuous springs of standard format and each has a slight upward arc, preferably, to coincide substantially with the curvature of the outer bands 33 and 34 so that they will, after being depressed by the ischial tuberosities, assume the configuration shown in Fig 1. It has been found that desirable results may be achieved by using 10 or 11 gauge spring wire made up into the sinuous bands 29 and 30. The outer bands 33 and 34 may be constructed of 8 or 9 gauge spring wire thereby to obtain a very firm format that hammocks slightly under the lateral portion the neck of the femur 23.A second embodiment is illustrated in Fig. 3. This is a modified form of the embodiment of Fig. 2 and like references are used to identify like parts of the seat.As before, the frame of the seat 24 is provided with side rails 27 and front rear rails 25 and 26, respectively. In place of the outer sinuous bands 33 and 34, thin flat flexible metal bands or, as illustrated, very firm flexible webbing 37 and 38, may be securely fastened by suitable clamps 39 and 40, which are themselves securely fastened to the seat frame 24 at the front and rear rails 25 and 26, respectively. The sinuous spring inner extensible members 29 and 30 for supporting the ischial tuberosities 13 and 14 are the same as shown in Fig. 2 and supported in the same manner.A straight back chair 41 is shown in Fig. 4 having depending legs 42 with a spring seat embodying the present construction in which the seat frame 24 is of the type shown in Fig. 2 with the inner spring members 29 or 30 being shown fastened to the front rail 25 by the spring clip 43 that is itself securely fastened to the top surface of front rail 25. The outer extensible bands otherwise called lateral support members 33 and 34 are positioned on the upper surface of the seat 25 and e3cC of the sinuous spring members 29, 30, 33 and 34 is arched upwardly slightly to reside substantially within the same plane. A layer 44 of padding or cushioning material such as urethane foam 44 overlies the spring members and of a depth of 2 to 5 cm, that is, relatively thin by comparison to the thicker urethane padding used in comparable conventional seating. A flexible covering 45 for example of textile or vinyl plastics material is used to upholster over the padding 44 and envelope, at least partially, the sides and upper surfaces thereof.The embodiment of Fig. 5 has components corresponding to those of the Fig. 2 embodiment but there is a wider gap 50 between the inner edges of the inner extensible members 29 and 30, and this is bridged by a number of tie wires 51 which prevent outward splaying of the inner members 29 and 30 when, for example, a sitter imposes his or her weight unevenly on the seat, or shifts sideways on it.
