## Description
Transparent and Translucent Poly butene l This invention relates to a method for altering opaque poly butene l . More particularly, this invention relates to a method for preparing transparent and trans lucent poly butene l also called poly l butene by appli cation of non polar volatile solvent and allowing said solvent to evaporate. The art has long recognized that crystalline alpha olefins exhibit polymorphism alternately called phases, types or forms . In particular, isotactic poly butene l , exists in at least four distinct crystalline forms. This polymorphic behavior of PB was first reported by Natta and co workers in Nuovo Cimento, 15, special number 152 1962 . The X ray and density properties of the polymers Were further studied by Zannetti et al and reported inChim. Ind., 43, 735 1961 . Cooling a fresh melt of poly butene l results in the formation of unstable tetragonal crystallites referred to by the previous workers as Type II poly butene l . These crystals gradually transform upon standing at room temperature to a more stable hexagonal polymer called Type I poly butene l . Complete Type II to Type I transformation usually occurs in a period of time ranging from about a day to more than a week, depending on such variables as molecular weight, copolymerization, pressure, temperature and the presence of impurities.Descriptions of such transforma tions can be found in Polymer Letters and the Journal ofPolymer Science, Volume II, pp. 519 521 1964 This reference describes the various phase transformations of poly butene l through various processing conditions including the hexagonal stable Type I, the tetragonal unstableType II and the orthorhombic stable Type III. Further discussions of these transformations can be found in theJournal of Polymer Science, Part A, Volume 3, pp. 3803 3813 1965 , I. D. Rubin and the Journal of Polymer Science,Polymer Letters Volume 5, pp. 839, 841 1967 by Schaffhause These references, while not exhaustive, are representative of the art in the area which teaches the effect of phase transformations.Concisely, the unstable Type II form of poly butene l 1 is colorless, transparent, soft and easily deformed. I n contrast, the stable Type I polymer is colorless, translucent or opaque, rigid and not prone to physical deformation. In commercial applications, melts of poly butene l which are formed into desired shapes are of the Type II form easily deformable and are usually allowed to age into a Type I form. This transition to a Type I form often yields finished products with undesirable shape changes and changes in optical properties. Therefore, a process which will retain the optical properties during aType II to Type I transformation has definite practical purposes. One of the most important optical properties that a polymer may possess is transparency. Transparency is defined for the purposes described herein as the ability to transmit light without appreciable scattering so that bodies lying beyond the transparent piece are visible. More broadly, it could be defined as the ability to see through the poly butene l . Stereoregular polymers such as poly butene l vary greatly in clarity from highly transparent to completely opaque. This phenomenon is due to the individual components that make up the crystalline polymer. Between opaque and transparent, the polymer obtains a state of translucency, which could be defined as a partial transparency by admitting and diffusing lights such that objects beyond the article which is translucent can not be clearly distinguished. O que articles are those impervious to the rays of visible light and which are not transparent or translucent, and allow no definition of objects beyond the article. A polymer is regarded as a heterogeneous mixture with components or aggregates having individual refractive indices. The size of the aggregates of radiating crystals or spherulites determines the heterogeneity of the polymer.A material is transparent if the dimensions of the spheru lites are less than the wavelength of light. In contrast, a material appears to be opague if there exists a diffusion of light due to spherulites with the same dimension as that of the wavelength of incident light. Generally, it is believed a slow rate of crystallization for a polymer results in spherulites of a size capable of interfering with light, thus the opaque or translucency obtained with Type I poly butene l during the slow one to seven or more days transformation from Type II to Type I. This is also true for copolymers of poly butene l where the copolymer is in concentrations below about 10 percent by weight above about 90 by weight of poly butene l . For example, amounts of polyethylene below about 10 percent can give transparent or translucent articles.Other polymers which can be used are polypropylene, 4 methyl l pentene and 4 hexylpentane.Blended polymers which, can be present not as true copolymers are polypropyleneoxide, polyethylene and polypropylene, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes and polyaramides. Mixtures of these can be used. Therefore, a slow rate for the Type II toType I phase transformation in isotactic poly butene l results in a material which is translucent. It would be of great benefit to provide a method for creating transparent poly butene l for use in pipes, lenses, containers and other applications which require transparency. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for altering the opaque properties of stable hexagonal poly butene l polymers. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the description proceeds. It has now been surprisingly discovered that when an opaque stable hexagonal polymorphic poly butene l is placed in an unstable tetragonal crystallite form, the optical properties can be altered by contacting the fresh melt poly butene l with a volatile, non polar solvent and immediately evaporating the solvent from the sample. The unstable form can be obtained from melts, solvents and other methods known to those skilled in this art. The optical properties of the opaque Type I material can be altered to any form from transparent to translucent, the degree of alteration depending upon the solvent and the temperature used in contacting the unstable poly butene l form. Solvents useful in the practice of the instant invention are nonpolar solvents which have a reflux temperature of about 1400C or less. Non polar solvents having a higher temperature of reflux can be used, but only when the contacting is carried out in at least a partial vacuum to give an effective temperature of around 1400C or less.Representatives of examples of those solvents whose reflux temperature is less than 1400C or less are n hexane, nheptane, n pentane, n octane, ethyl ether, diisopropyl ether n butane, n nonane and n decane. Of these, n hexane, npentane, n heptane, n octane and diethyl ether are preferred. Materials such as cyclohexane can be used to produce a translucent material. Generally, a preferred temperature for contacting the fresh melt of poly butene l is from about 40 C to about 9O0C, but temperatures of from about OOC to about 1400C can be used. It must be realized that the temperatures can vary slightly depending upon the pressures used during the contacting stage. Concisely explained, the method of the instant invention consists of preparing a fresh melt of Type I poly butene l to form a Type II poly butene l , then contact ing the fresh melt Type II material with a volatile non polar solvent maintained at a temperature which will produce the desired optical properties, removing the Type II poly butene l from the solvent and allowing the solvent to rapidly evaporate to produce predominantly Type I poly butene l having altered optical properties. Normally, transparent instead of translucent material will be preferred. Preferred conditions,for preparing transparent polymers are temperatures of from 40900C and solvents selected from the group consisting of nhexane, n pentane, n heptane, n octane, diethyl ether and nbutane. Preferred conditions for producing translucent polymers are temperatures of from, 0 C to about 400 .and solvents selected from the group consisting of n hexane, n heptane, n pentane, n octane, cyclohexane, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, n nonane, n decane, ethane and propane. The instant invention is more concretely described with references to the examples below wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The examples are provided to exemplify the instant invention and not to limit it. The test used to quantify the transparency of polymer films is described inU. S. Patent No. 3,558,551, said method hereby incorporated by reference. Concisely, the method describes the ability to distinguish a one eighth letter test and the ability to distinguish a one and one quarter inch letter measured as distance behind the article in inches. Example 1 Crystalline, isotactic poly butene l was prepared using the conventional Ziegler Natta catalyst combination, consisting of a mixture of dithy1aluininum chloride and titanium trichloride. The monomer, 1 butene, was used as a solvent for the polymerization reaction.The precipitated polymer was 93.9 insoluble in boiling diethyll ether and had a specific viscosity of 0.565 in decalin at 1150C. A .013 inch thick film of stable poly butene l was heated to 1500C and cooled to rood emperature pe ducing the Type II polymer. The existence of the Type II polymorph was confirmed using infrared techniques, the various polymorphs of poly l butene such as Types I, II and III exhibiting unique infrared spectra as described by Clampitt et al in the Journal of Polymer Science, C6, pp. 143 151 1964 . These characteristic spectra were used to confirm the existence of the various polymorphs in all experiments. The Type II and Type I crystallites exhibit absorption peaks at 900 and 925 cm , respectively.The extent of the Type II to Type I transformation was determined by comparing the relative intensities of the absorption bands. After melting the sample of polytbutene l , the infrared spectra revealed the exclusive existence of theType II polymorph. The film was then dipped into a beaker containing boiling n hexane for two seconds, then withdrawn.The solvent was allowed to evaporate from the surface of the film. The sample was analyzed using infrared techniques which indicated that more than 50 percent of the Type II crystallites had been transformed to the Type I structure.The film remained colorless and transparent. A comparative example was carried out using a second .013 inch thick film of stable poly butene l which was heated to 1500C and cooled to room temperature. The infrared spectra of the sample showed the presence of theType II structure exclusively. The extent of the Type II to Type 1 transformation was determined by comparing the relative intensities of the absorption bands at particular times. The half life of the Type II to Type 1 process for the control sample at room temperature in air was 23.5 hours, and the sample was translucent, not transparent. In Examples 2 through 4 below, three strips measuring 4 x 1 x .0033 inches of commercial grade poly butene l co polymer containing 5 10 weight percent polyethylene were used. The samples were heated to 1400 1500C for 10 minutes to form the unstable Type II crystallites, and then allowed to cool immediately to room temperature. Example 2 One half of a sample of Type II poly butene l was dipped into a beaker containing n hexane at room temperature for two seconds, then withdrawn. The solvent was then allowed to evaporate from the surface of the film.The treated portion of poly butene l was highly translucent, almost opaque, while the untreated half remained transparent.The solvent treated portion was analyzed using infrared techniques which showed that a 52 percent Type II to Type I phase transformation had taken place. The infrared spectra for the untreated portion indicated that a phase change had not taken place. Thus, dipping a sample of poly butene l in a solvent at room temperature followed by its evaporation results in a translucent to opaque product. Example 3 One half of a poly butene l strip was dipped into a beaker containing boiling n hexane for a few seconds, then withdrawn. The solvent was allowed to evaporate in air at room temperature. The treated side showed a significantType II to Type I phase acceleration 54 percent Type I poly butene l and remained transparent. The untreated portion showed a strong absorption at 900 cam 1 in the infrared region indicating that a phase change had not occurred. After 72 hours, the treated portion remained colorless and transparent while the untreated side was translucent due to the phase change. Example of a Example 4 One half of a strip of poly butene l was dipped into a beaker containing n heptane at 90 95 C for two seconds, then withdrawn. The solvent was allowed to eva porate in air at room temperature. The treated portion showed a 56 percent Type II to Type I phase change by infrared techniques. The entire sample, however, remained colorless and transparent. The treated portion was re analyzed in the infrared region after 2.5 hours and showed a further increase to greater than 60 percent Type crystallites. The sample remained transparent. Examples 5 through 7 used three plaques of poly butene 1 .071 inches thick. The procedure described in Examples 2, 3 and 4 were repeated. The hexane treated sample contacted at room temperature was tranlucent imme diately after treatment. The control sample remained colorless and transparent during this time lapse. After 7 days, the control material became translucent. However, the sample of poly butene 1 that was contacted with boiling hexane remained transparent throughout the experiment. Examples 8 through 15 A polymer possessing an isotactic index of 97,8 percent and a specific viscosity of 0.600 in decalin at 115 C was pressed into a tranlucent sheet of poly butene l .0009 inches thick. Eight test strips were cut from the sheet and heated in an oven to 1500C to induce a completeType I to Type II phase shift. The samples were then cooled immediately to room temperature. The polymer films were colorless as well as tranparent after heat treatment. The infrared spectra for each strip was determined and each strip showed the exclusive existence of unstableType II crystal structure. In Example 8 and in Examples 10 through 15, the Type II poly butene l test strips were dipped into beakers containing volatile hydrocarbon materials for a few seconds and withdrawn. The solvent was allowed to evaporate in air at room temprature.InExample 8, the Type II poly butene l strip was contacted with various solvents at various temperatures as follows in Example 8, boiling hexane at 690C Example 10, boiling ,n pentane at 360C Example 11, n heptane at 820C Example 12, n octane at 820C Example 13, boiling cyclohexane at 820C Example 14, boiling diethyl ether at 350C andExample 15, boiling diisopropyl ether at 690C. Example 9 was a control run which was not contacted with,a volatile non polar solvent. The test strip was simply stored for 10 days at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In all samples carried out above, the test strips were stored for 10 days at room temperature and atmospheric pressure after contact with the solvent.All strips, including the control, were tested for clarity on the tenth day. The test used was similar to the test described in U. S. Patent No. 3,558,551. The poly butene l test strips were placed 6 inches from a viewer s eye. The maximum see through value from which figures could be easily discerned was determined by measuring the distance in inches between an eye chart with letters one half inch in height and the polymer sheet The distance between the eye chart and the polymer film was varied, while the distance between the film and the viewer eye was held constant. The clarity of the film was determined through the use of a formula wherein clarity is equal to the see through distance of the sample divided by the see through distance of the control sample. Values greater than 1 represent a material which is more transparent than the control sample, wherein values less than 1 indicate a material more translucent than the control sample. The results ofExamples 8 through 15 are set forth in Table I below.

The data also clearly shows that various solvents and temperature conditions are more effective than others in improving clarity. The temperature of the solvent should be lower than 900 but above room temperature for hydrocarbons that boil above room temperature at atmospheric pressure.Contacting poly butene l at room temperature within hexane at atmospheric pressure will result in a translucent sample.However, contacting a poly butene l sample with volatile materials at temperatures above 900C or lower than room temperature to afford transparency is considered to be within the scope of the present invention. It is clear that the conditions of temperature, solvent and pressure can be varied to obtain the desired result. Examples 16 21 Poly butene l with an isotactic index of 97.88 and a specific viscosity of 0.600 in decalin was compression molded into a plaque 0.0009 inches thick. Six test strips were cut from the plaque and heated to 1500C then cooled immediately to induce a complete ItolI phase change In examples 16 18 and in examples 19 21 the test strips were dipped into beakers containing n hexane at various temperatures from 50C to reflux for a few seconds and withdrawnThe solvent was allowed to evaporate in air at room temperature. In example 16 the poly butene l strip was contacted with boiling n hexane at 700C in example 17 with n hexane at 600C in example 18 with n hexane at 560C in example 20 with n hexane at 230C and in example 21 with n hexane at 50C. Example 19 represents a control run.After removing the strip from the oven, the polymer sheet was allowed to phase transform from its unstable type II structure to a type I form in air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.The test strips were stored. for 10 days and its clarity was determined. A 1 8 letter test was used and the following results were determined.

Contacting the poly butene l at low temperatures, for example, with n hexane at 50C, will produce a more translucent sample. Contact time for the sample can vary depending upon the thickness of the sample and the solvents used.However, normally contact time will range from 1 2 to 15 seconds, although from about 1 1 2 to about 5 seconds is preferred. While representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the instant invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.
