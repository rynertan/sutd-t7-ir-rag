# Local area network.

## Abstract
In a local area network LAN , of the Ethernet type, one of the segments, i.e. one bus, is replaced by a star coupler connected via optical fibre pairs to a number of stations. Each pair includes a GO fibre and a RETURN fibre. As in the usual Ethernet system, collision detection relies on measuring sig nal level on the medium, if it is too large then a collision condition exists. In an optical fibre system a similar collision detection technique is used. To adjust the collision detectors 27 thresholds it is necessary to be aware of the network s at tenuation as seen by the station. To do this a lower level pilot tone 21 is sent from each station, each station having its own tone frequency. The amplitude of this tone when it returns to its own station indicates the system s attenuation, and this is used the collision detector s 27 threshold. In an alternative the pilot signals are pseudo random bit sequences.
