# Musical instrument with improved keyboard.

## Abstract
An improved keyboard for a musical instrument includes a plurality of keys arranged in a side by side order, all lying in a common plane. Different embodiments of the invention have a varying number of keys per octave, from as small as 12 keys per octave to as high as 90 120 keys per octave. In those embodiments of the invention in which the number of keys per octave results in a key whose width is too narrow to be uniquely depressed by an operator s finger, associated apparatus determines from a plurality of keys which have been depressed, a particular tone to be produced. The keyboard may be associated with apparatus to distinguish one set of keys from other sets of keys, which apparatus can include a selectively energizable light source associated with each different key or other equivalent apparatus. All the keys have an upper surface lying in a plane, are of equal length, and are arranged parallel to one another. Different keys correspond to and select different sounds for production. Groups of the keys correspond to different octaves, each group including an identical number of keys. The distance from a reference point on one key to the next is proportional to the logarithm of the interval between the sounds which those keys produce.
