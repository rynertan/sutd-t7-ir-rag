# TABLETS

## Abstract
A tablet contains a poorly compressible medicament and a plasticizer incorporated into the body of the tablet. The plasticizer reduces the need for high pressures during the manufacture of the tablets, and reduces the problems associated with capping and laminating of the tablet.
