# CONVERSION OF BIOMASS INTO COMBUSTIBLE GAS

## Abstract
A movable grate 50 is mounted on an upright pipe 36 is disposed within and spaced above the bottom of an upright vessel 12, 14 of a gasifier. A layer 54 of loose, high heat resistant, ball like elements is established on the grate 50 . Biomass is continuously charged into the vessel 12, 14 above the grate 50 and combusted so as to form a char bed of biomass immediately above the layer 54 . Combustion supporting gas is introduced into the char bed and drawn downwardly through the char bed, the layer 54 and the grate 50 . The gas generated thereby is withdrawn from the vessel 12, 14 below the grate 50 by means of a fan 72 . The grate 50 is moved so as to move the individual elements of the layer 54 and effect gravitational filtering of char coal particles from the char bed. The char bed is agitated and combustion supporting gas is introduced into the char bed by the pipe 36 and the tubular branches 62, 64, 66 .
