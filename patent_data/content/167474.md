# QUICK ACTION ON OFF VALVE

## Abstract
A quick action on off valve comprises a housing 2 including a partition 10 having an interconnecting passage way 18,20 between two chambers 12,14 on opposite sides of the partition. One chamber includes a fixed piston 36,38 and a movable cylinder 40 , the cylinder 40 including a resilient disc 44 between its closed end 42 and the port leading from the first chamber 12 , and a spring 46 urging the cylinder 40 in the direction tending to close the latter port. Spacing means 48 are provided between the partition 10 and the open end of the cylinder 40 for continuously maintaining communication between the first chamber 12 and the interconnecting passageway 18,20 . The difference in the cross sectional areas of the first port and of the cylinder 40 result in a smaller area of the cylinder 40 being effective to open the valve when the valve is closed, but a larger area of the cylinder 40 being effective to close the valve when the valve is open, thereby providing a quick action opening and closing of the valve.
