## Description
REMOVAL OF METALLIC CONTAMINANTS FROM PETROLEUM FRACTIONS. The present invention generally relates to the removal of metallic contaminants from petroleum fractions. Specifically, the present invention relates to the removal of complex organo metallic compounds, for example, of the porphyrin type, and particularly those compounds containing nickel and vanadium from residua by deasphalting or from vacuum gas oils. Petroleum gas oils normally contain iron, nickel, vanadium and other metallic contaminants which have an adverse effect upon petroleum processing operations. As the cut point, the atmospheric equivalent of the highest boiling material in the distillate increases, the fraction of the feed recovered as distillate increases. However, as the cut point is elevated, the metal concentration in the distillate also increases.In petroleum processing operations such as catalytic cracking the presence of these metallic contaminants in the petroleum feed e.g., in a deasphalted oil, leads to rapid catalyst contamination by metals causing an undesirable increase in the hydrogen and coke wakes, a loss in gasoline yield, a loss in conversion activity and a decrease in the catalyst life.The metal contaminant concentration generally is higher in the heavier feedstocks. Thus, the removal of metal contaminants is becoming more important as increasingly heavy feedstocks are being refined and as additional efforts are being directed at upgrading the residual petroleum fractions. In the past, efforts have been directed at the removal of metal contaminants from petroleum fractions by a variety of methods including deasphalting processes, hydrotreating processes and HF extraction.U.S. Patent No. 2,926,129 is directed at the removal of organometallic compounds and the deasphalting of a petroleum fraction by heating the petroleum fraction at 343.3 b 46t. a temperature ofit650 850 F for 0.1 to 5 hours after which the fraction is contacted with an acidic material soluble in the petroleum fraction, such as HC1, to coagulate the metallic contaminants. A sludging component, such as a liquid S02 is then added to the petroleum fraction at the rate of 0.1 to 3 volumes of S02 per volume of oil to promote precipitation of the asphaltene. A solvent also is added to the fraction preferably at the rate of 0.1 to 10 volumes per volume of oil to separate the asphaltene sludhe fraction in a fractionating towerEMI2.1 operated at temperatures of 30 to 300 F andlpressures ot 25 to 500 psig .This patent also discloses in a table in column 5 that a less effective reduction in metals content in the recovered oil may be accomplished utilizing the solvent and liquid SO2, without the acid.Use of the process described in this patent is not desirable, since relatively large quantities of sulfur dioxide in the liquid state are required, which necessitates operating at high vessel pressures if high temperatures are used and may necessitate the removal of theSO2 from the recovered oil. Moreover, addition of an acid, such as HCl would require that the processing equipment be acid resistant. In addition, the presence of acidic compounds in the recovered oil would be injurious to catalysts used in subsequent processing. U.S. Patent No. 3,294,678 is directed at a deasphalting process for the separation and removal of asphaltenic material including organo metallic complexes of nickel and vanadium which comprises treating the petroleum fraction with an alkalinous bisulfide or bisulEMI2.2 title in aqueous solution under pressure in tne rangeEMI2.3 of 150 to 2000 Psiq in the presence of sufficient sulfurEMI2.4 dioxide such that the partial pressure of the sulfur di EMI2.5 oxide is within the range or about 150 to about 1500 psig .The asphaltenic material including organo metallic com pounds is converted into a water soluble sulfonic acid salt which is subsequently extracted. This process is not desirable because of the additional steps of separating the water fraction from the petroleum fraction and separating the sulfonic acid salts from the asphaltenic material. U.S. Patent No. 2,969,320 discloses a method for removing tetraethyl lead from gasoline and other hydrocarbon liquids by injecting sulfur dioxide into the liquid to form an insoluble lead sulfide which may subsequently be removed by filtration. This method does not disclose or suggest removal of metals such as nickel and vanadium from petroleum fractions by heating in the presence of sulfur dioxide prior to deasphalting or distillation. U.S. Patent No. 3,095,368 describes a method for selectively removing iron, nickel and vanadium from an asphaltic petroleum feedstock by deasphalting the oil and subsequently contacting the oil with a mineral acid to coagulate the metallic compound. The metallic compounds are then separated. This process requires the use of mineral acids which are corrosive and requires additional processing steps. In a paper presented at the 1980 meeting of the Division of Petroleum Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, Bukowski and Gurdzinska disclosed a method for reducing the adverse catalytic effect of metal contaminants present in the distillate from atmospheric residuum. The method included the heat treating of the atmospheric residuum in the presence of cumene hydroperoxide CHP for up to six hours at 1200C.This step increased the distillate fraction obtained from the atmospheric residuum feed and decreased the metals content of the distillate which subseauently was used as feed for a catalytic cracking unit. This procedure is not advantageous due to the relatively high cost of the CHP required and the long treatment times involved. British Patent Application No. 2,031,011 describes a method for reducing the metals and asphaltene content of a heavy oil by hydrotreating the oil in the presence of a catalyst including a metal component fromGroup Ib, lib, lila, Va, VI, and VIII of the PeriodicTable followed by deasphalting. This process is not preferred since relatively large quantities of hydrogen are required in addition to a large investment in hydrotreating reactors and process equipment. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a process which reduces the metals concentration in petroleum. feedstocks to sufficiently low levels without the addition of large amounts of acidic materials. It is also advantageous to provide a process which will reduce the metals concentration in the petroleum fraction without an excessive amount of equip inent and without the addition of a large number of additional processing operations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject invention is directed at a method for reducing the metal contaminant concentration in a petroleum fraction containing the metal contaminant and which may contain an asphaltenic component comprising the steps of a. contacting the petroleum fraction in a contacting zone with an effective amount of a metal rejection agent selected from the class consisting of sulfur dioxide and precursors of sulfur dioxide at an elevated temperature and b. thereafter either I. contacting the petroleum fraction with a deasphalting agent to form a first fraction relatively lean in asphaltene and metal contaminant and a second fraction relatively rich in asphaltene and the metal contaminant, after which the first and second fractions are separated or, II. passing the petroleum fraction into a vacuum separation zone wherein the petroleum fraction containing the metal contaminant is separated into a distillate having a relatively low metal contaminant concentration and a bottoms having a relatively high metal contaminant concentration. In a preferred embodiment the petroleum fraction, comprising atmospheric distillation column bottoms, is passed into a contacting zone maintained at a temperature ranging between about 2000C and 4500C for aboutO.Ol.to about 5 hours, said contact time varying inversely with temperature in the presence of about 0.5 to about 5.0 weight percent sulfur dioxide in the vapor phase, based upon the weight of the petroleum fraction.The petroleum fraction is then deasphalted or vacuum distilled. In deasphalting the petroleum fraction is contacted in a deasphalting zone with an effective amount of a deasphalting agent or solvent such as propane, butane, pentane or hexane and then separated into a first fraction relatively lean in asphaltene and metal contaminant and a second fraction relatively rich in asphaltene and metal contaminants. Solvent fom said first and second fractions preferably is recovered and recycled to the deasphalting zone. For example, when propane is used as the solvent, the solvent to feed ratio typically ranges from about 2 1 to 6 1. The actual solvent to feed ratio used will be a function of the solvent and the feed characteristics. These ratios are known by those skilled in the art. In vacuum distillation, the petroleum fraction, after passing through the contacting zone, is transferred to a vacuum distillation column where the fraction is separated into a distillate relatively low in metals content having at least one component boiling above about 5200C at atmospheric pressure, preferably above about 5650C and most preferably above about 5900C and a bottoms having a relatively high metals content.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a plot of the equilibrium weight percent of the nickel on cracking catalyst as a function of the parts per million of nickel in the feed at typical fluid catalytic cracking conditions.

Figure 7 is a simplified process flow diagram illustrating another method for practicing the subject invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Figures 1 5 graphically illustrate the importance of reducing the nickel and vanadium content of catalytic cracking feedstocks. Generally, vanadium is considered to exhibit about one quarter oft the adverse catalytic effect of nickel on a weight equivalent basis. The adverse catalytic effect of nickel and vanadium is discussed in an article by Cimbalo, Foster and Wachtel in Oil and Gas Journal May 15, 1972, pages 112 122, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the nickel content of the feed and the corresponding nickel content of the catalyst under typical cat cracking conditions. Figure 2 illustrates the weight percent of the feed converted to hydrogen as a function of the nickel concentration of the catalyst. Figure 3 illustrates the increase in vanadium and nickel content of the distillate from a typical residual petroleum fraction as a function of the cut point where the subject invention has not been practiced. Typically, in the production of vacuum gas oils, the cut point is limited to a maximum temperature of approximately 565 C. Above this temperature the metals concentration in the distillate increases sharply as shown by the curves for the nickel and vanadium concentrations.Figure 4 illustrates the percent of a typical heavy petroleum feed which is distilled into a vacuum gas oil distillate as a function of the cut point. It should be noted that, as the cut point increases, the volume percent of the feed recovered as distillate increases. Use of the subject invention results in reduced metals content in the distillate at a given cut point or increased yield with substantially the same metals content utilizing a higher cut point. Figure 5 illustrates the weight percent of the feed converted to coke as a function of the nickel content on the catalyst. ile Figures 1, 2 and 5 are directed at the detrimental effects of nickel on hydrogen and coke production, vanadium and other metals, such as iron and copper may also be present in petroleum fractions.These metals are less catalytically active, but also may contribute to excessive hydrogen and coke production. As used herein the term metal contaminant is defined to include all of the aforementioned metals. In the data shown in Figures 2 and 5 a com mercially available silica alumina zeolite catalyst sold under the tradename CBZ 1, manufactured by Davison Division, W.R. Grace and Company was used. TheCBZ 1 catalyst used was first steamed at 7600C for 16 hours after which the catalyst was contaminated with the indicated metals by laboratory impregnation, followed by calcining at about 5400C for four hours. Tests were run using a microcatalytic cracking MCC unit. The MCC unit comprised a captive fluidized bed of catalyst kept at a cracking zone temperature of 5000C. Tests were run by passing a vacuum gas oil having a minimum boiling point of about 3400C and a maximum boiling point of about 565 C through the reactor for two minutes and analyzing for hydrogen and coke production.It can be seen that as the nickel concentration on the catalyst increases, the undesired hydrogen and coke yields also increase.Thus, it can be appreciated that a process which would provide a cat cracking feedstock of lower metals content would be particularly useful. Referring to Figure 6, one method for practicing the subject invention is shown. In this figure valves, pumps, piping, instrumentation and equipment not essential to the understanding of the subject invention have been eliminated for clarity. A petroleum fraction is shown entering contacting zone 10 through line 12. A metals rejection agent is added to zone 10 through line 14. Typically contacting zone 10 will comprise a process vessel whose size is a function of the feed rate through line 12 and the desired residence time. After the requisite residence time in zone 10, the petroleum fraction is transferred through line 16 to a deasphalting zone 20 which comprises a countercurrent mixing tower, in which the petroleum fraction is contacted with a solvent entering through line 22 to form a first fraction relatively lean in metal contaminant and asphaltene and a second fraction relatively rich in metal contaminant and asphaltene. The first fraction comprising a deasphalted oil and solvent mixture is then transferred from the top of tower 20 through line 24 to a separation zone 30, comprising a flash distillation tower, in which the mixture is separated into a deasphalted oil fraction relatively low in asphaltenic and metal compounds exiting zone 30 through line 32 and a solvent fraction which exits zone 30 through line 34 and is recycled to zone 20 through line 22.The second fraction comprising a molten asphaltene fraction containing a small amount of solvent is withdrawn from the bottom of tower 20 and fed via line 36 to flash separation zone 38 wherein the mixture is separated into an asphalt stream, exiting through line 42, and a solvent stream which is returned via lines 40 and 22 to mixing zone 20. The operating conditions for deasphalting operations are dependent upon the type of solvent, solvent to oil ratio and the characteristics of the feedstock to the deasphalting operation. These variables are known by those skilled in the art. A discussion of deasphalting operations in general may be found inAdvances in Petroleum Chemistry and Refining, volume 5, pages 284 291, John Wiley and Sons, New York, New York 1962 , the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Referring to Figure 7, another method for practicing the subject invention is shown. A petroleum fraction is shown entering contacting zone 110 through line 112. A metal rejection agent is added to zone 110 through line 114. Typically contacting zone 110 will comprise a process vessel whose size is a function of the feed rate through line 112 and the desired residence time.After the requisite residence time in zone 110 the petroleum fraction is transferred through line 116 to a vacuum separation zone 120 in which the feedstock is separated into a distillate 122 and a bottoms product 124. The composition of the petroleum feedstock passed into contacting zones 10 and 110 is not critical.Typically this will comprise the bottoms from an atmospheric distillation having an initial atmospheric boiling point of above about 2859C which has a total elemental metal contaminant content ranging between about 1 and about 2000 parts per million by weight ETPPM , although other feedstocks having high metal content may also be used. To avoid unnecessary product contamination as well as to minimize costs, the amount of metal rejection agent used should be the lowest amount which will give effective results at the desired operating conditions. The amount of metal rejection agent required will be a function of the specific agent used and the metal content of the fee.The metal rejection agent may be selected from the class consisting of vapor phase sulfur dioxide and precursors of vapor phase sulfur dioxide, such as sulfurous acid, ammonium bisulfite and alkyl metal bisulfites. Of these, the most preferred compound based upon cost and effectiveness is sulfur dioxide. Typically, the concentration of SO2 added to the high metals feed will range from about 0.5 to about 5.0 weight percent of the feed, preferably about 1 to about 3 weight percent. If a precursor of SO2 is used, the precursor concentration should be sufficient to furnish SO2 concentrations of from 0.5 to 5.0 weight percent of the. feed, and preferably 1 3 weight percent of the feed. The residence time of the petroleum fraction in contacting zone 10 must be sufficient to provide adequate contacting between the metal rejection agent and the petroleum fraction. The residence time in zones 10 and 110 is a function of the specific metal rejection agent utilized, the process conditions in zones 10 and 110 and the metal contaminant content of the petroleum fraction. Typically, the contacting time in zones 10 and 110 ranges between 0.01 and 5 hours.The temperature in zones 10 and 110 is above the critical temperature ofSO2, approximately 157.70C and typically may range between about 2000C and about 450 C, preferably betweenEMI10.1 about 250 C and about 400 C, while the pressure may range EMI10.2 between about 20 and about 400 psig , preferably betweenEMI10.3 about 50 and about 200 psig . In the process shown in Figure 6 the tempera ture in deasnhaltino zone 2n generally mav ranee betweenEMI10.4 about 25 and 2500C, while tieApressure may range between about 0 and 600 psig . The deasphalting agent or solvent added may be any solvent effective for deasphalting the petroleum fraction. Typically, an organic solvent, preferably an alkane, is added to mixing zone 20 in a ratio of solvent to petroleum fraction of from about 1 1 to about 20 1 by volume. Among the preferred alkane solvents are propane, butane, pentane and hexane, with the most preferred being propane. Deasphalting zone 20 may comprise conventional mixing equipment such as a countercurrent contacting tower.Separation zones 30 and 38 comprise means by which the deasphalted oil and asphaltene fractions, respectively, are separated from solvent. Typically, these separation zones comprise flash distillation towers. The operating conditions for separation zones 30 and 38 are well known by those skilled in the art. When propane is used as the deasphaltinq EMI11.1 agent, the pressure in separation zones 30 and 38 EMI11.2 Typically ranges Detween aroutR u ana about Juu psisi. The temperatures in zone 30 typically may range between 150 and 1750C, which the temperature in zone 38 may range between about 2250C and about 3250C. In the process shown in Figure 7, vacuum separation zone 120, generally comprising a distillation column may be of conventional design. The specific operating conditions are a function of the feed composition entering through line 116 and the desired distillate composition exiting through line 122. The design of the distillation column is not critical and would be determined by conventional design techniques. Typically, the absolute pressure measured at the top of zone 120 will range between about 10 and about 100 mm Hg, and the temperature at the base of zone 120 will range between about 3700C and about 4500C. The cut point of the distillate normally will be at least 550eC and may range as high as 5900C or above. The following examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the subject invention in reducing the metals content from a deasphalted petroleum fraction.Comparative experiments were conducted using as the feedstock a Tia Juana atmospheric residuum having an initial boiling point of about 2600C, a nickel content of 34 parts per million by weight wppm and a vanadium content of 273 wppm. In these examples 300 g. of theTia Juana residuum was charged to a one liter Hastelloy C autoclave with 6.3 g. 2.1 weight percent on feed of gaseous sulfur dioxide. The autoclave then was heated to about 340 C for stirred contact for the indicatedEMI12.1 time auring which time tneipressure reached atoutR psi Upon cooling to 1500C, the pressure was released and the autoclave was flushed with nitrogen while cooling further to room temperature.The resultant treated residuum was contacted with 16 volumes of pentane per volume of residuum, mixed for 0.5 hour at 600C in a stirred autoclave and then cooled to room temperature.The resulting mixture was filtered using a 82 WEatman paper to recover an asphaltene fraction relatively rich in asphaltene and metal and a deasphalted oil fraction relatively lean in asphaltene and metal. The results of these experiments for sulfur dioxide pretreatments of 60 and 100 minutes are shown in Table 1 below designated as samples 1 and 2, respectively. Sample 3 of Table 1 illustrates that when the same petroleum feedstock did not have the aforementioned sulfur dioxide pretreatment prior to deasphalting in a manner similar to that of samples 1 and 2, the resulting deasphalted oil had a higher metals content.

Another test was conducted on an identical sample of Tia Juana atmospheric residuum to determine if the heat treatment step would be effective in reducing the metals content in deasphalted oil if sulfur dioxide in the vapor phase were not present during the heat treating step. Both samples were heat treated for the same time and were deasphalted in a similar manner. As shown in Table II below, heat treating alone did not reduce the metals content of the deasphalted oil significantly.

Thus, the presence of organo sulfur compounds in the petroleum feedstock processed even in combination with heat treatment is ineffective in significantly reducing the metals content of deasphalted oil. Similar comparative experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the subject invention in reducing the metals content of a vacuum gas oil. Comparative experiments were made using as feed a Tia Juana atmospheric residuum having an initial boiling point of about 2600C, a nickel content of 34 parts per million by weight wppm , and a vanadium content of 273 wppm.Results are given in Table III below. In this example, sample number five, 300 g. of Tia Juana residuum, was charged to a one liter autoclave of Hastelloy C construction, along with 6.3 g. 2.1 weight percent on feed of gaseous sulfur dioxide. The autoclave was then heated to 3430C for a one hour stirred contact, durina whichEMI14.1 time tneXpressure reacreo s pslge upon cooling to 1500C, the pressure was released and the autoclave was flushed with nitrogen while cooling further to room temperature.The resultant treated residuum was thenEMI14.2 batch distilled atl EMI14.3 SEP ubsclute SEP prrssu tb soo SEP micront SEP SEP utB SEP on tb a column having one theoretical plate to obtain a vacuum residuum bottoms fraction and a vacuum gas oil VGO fraction of maximum boiling point 3150C, which corresponds to an atmospheric equivalent boiling point of 5650C. With sample number six, the SO2 pretreatment step was omitted.The Tia Juana residuum feed was distilled in a manner similar to that of sample number 5 to recover a 5650C atmospheric equivalent boiling point vacuum gas oil and a 565 0C vacuum residuum bottoms. As can be seen fromTable III, the vacuum gas oil obtained from the SO2 treated sample contained significantly less metals.Expressed in terms of reduction in the equivalent nickel content of the vacuum gas oil VGO , SO2 treating is seen to give about a 66 percent reduction in metals content relative to the VGO from the untreated residuum sample.

The S02 treatment used in the experiment, designated as sample seven, was similar to that used in the previous test in Table III.However, the vacuum distillation of the treated oil in sample number 7 and of the untreated feed, designated as sample number 8, was carried to a higher temperature to isolate a vacuum gas oil of final atmospheric equivalent boiling point of 5930C. As shown by the data in Table IV, the 5930C cut point VGO obtained from the SO2 treated resid, sample number 7, contained significantly less metals than the untreated sample, sample number 8.

The procedure used was exactly that described for sample number 8 of the previous example, except that S02 was omitted and the contact time at 3430C was extended to two hours in order to give heat soaking the best possible chance to effect a lowering of metals content in the VGO product. After heat soaking, a vacuum distillation was carried out to produce a vacuum gas oil having an atmospheric equivalent boiling point of 5930C. Results are shown inTable V and are compared in the table with the results obtained for sample number 8 which had no pretreatment at all. As is apparent from the data, heat soaking alone at 3430C does not give any appreciable reduction in the metals content of the VGO product.

Thus, the presence of organo sulfur compounds in the petroleum feedstock processed even in combination with heat treatment is ineffective in significantly reducing the metals content of the vacuum gas oil.
