# Method and apparatus for cooling high temperature structures with a fluid coolant.

## Abstract
In accordance with the invention, a cooling fluid is injected into a hot flowing gas through a passageway 13 in a wall 10 which contains and is subject to the hot gas. The passageway 13 is slanted in a downstream direction at an acute angle to the wall 10 . A cusp 27 shape is provided in the passageway 13 to generate vortices in the injected cooling fluid thereby reducing the energy extracted from the hot gas for that purpose. The cusp shape 27 increases both film cooling effectiveness and wall area coverage. The cusp 27 may be at either the downstream or upstream side of the passageway 13 , the former substantially eliminating flow separation of the cooling fluid from the wall 10 immediately downstream of the passageway 13 .
