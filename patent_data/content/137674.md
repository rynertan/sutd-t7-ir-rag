# Radiation image read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image read out apparatus comprises devices 1, 2, 10 for scanning a stimulable phosphor sheet 3 carrying a radiation image stored therein with stimulating rays in a main scanning direction A and in a sub scanning direction B . A light guide member 4 having a light input face 4a extending in the main scanning direction and a light output face closely contacted with a photodetector 5 is positioned above the stimulable phosphor sheet. An aper ture member 9 is positioned between the surface of the stimulable phosphor sheet and the light input face of the light guide member. The aperture member is provided with an aperture 9a for allowing stimulating rays 1b to impinge upon the stimulable phosphor sheet and for allowing light 1c, 1c emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet upon stimulation thereof by the stimulating rays to enter the light input face of the light guide member, and light shielding sections 9A, 9B positioned adjacently to the aperture on opposite sides thereof in the sub scanning direction.
