## Description
Cement slurry composition for cementing wells traversing salt formations and corresponding cementing methods This invention relates to the cementing of drilling wells, particularly oil wells. In drilling a well through underground formations in order to produce or inject fluids therein, the well must be cemented both to preserve its integrity and to keep control of the fluids injected therein or produced therefrom, among other purposes. It is common practice for the production of fluids, such as for production of crude oil, tb lower steel tubing into the drill hole. After this, a cement slurry with suitable properties is prepared at the surface and injected into the tubing.Thereafter, the cement slurry is displaced meaning that a displacement fluid is injected behind it up to a level of a few meters above the shoe of the tubing. Nearly all the cement slurry is thus pushed back into the annular space or annulus between the tubing and the wall of the well. The slurry having been placed, it is allowed to set and its mechanical strength is allowed to develop to obtain sound support for the tubing, suitable bonding with the surrounding rocks of various compositions and isolation of the respective zones from fluid migrations. A great number of slurry formulations are known which enable the properties of the cement slurry mainly its density, setting time or thickening time, rheology, fluid loss, free water, compressive strength, permeability and resistance to chemical attack to be adapted to meet the requirements stemming from the nature of the wells and that of the formations traversed. A good mix design is especially important when the cement slurry is used to cement a well drilled through salt formations, as the equilibrium conditions between the cement and the saline zones are difficult to establish. Failing to establish these equilibrium conditions soon results in the salts dissolving and the alkalis migrating into the cement which slows the setting of the cement and consequently adversely affects its mechanical strength, and produces a poor bond between the cement and the surrounding formations. Two main cementing techniques have been developed hereto, to seal wells going through salt formations cementing with slurries strongly laden with salts from 18 by weight of mix water, up to saturation , and cementing with slurries containing very small amounts of salts from just a few percent by weight of water, down to . The first approach thus consists in using high salt cements. Since salt formations are drilled with salt saturated mud, it seemed logical also to use cement slurries either saturated or nearly saturated with salts so that ther slurry would be compatible with the drilling mud. The main advantage of this technique is that dissolution of any further quantities of salts from the formation cannot take place, so that a relatively good bond can be obtained between the cement and the surrounding formation. In fact, however, there are a number of very serious disadvantages associated with the use of such salt laden slurries, including 1 Thickening time is difficult to adjust because these cement slurries are Âµintrinsicallyw delayed. 2 Said slurries are always viscous, so that it is difficult to adapt their rheology to turbulent flow. 3 Fluid loss from salt laden slurries is very great. 4 Salt laden cement slurries are not compatible with other formations or stratums above or below the salt formations for which they were designed. For example, amorphous silica, which is encountered in certain sandstone formations and in acidic volcanic rock, reacts with salts to form expansible alkaline silicates which can completely destroy the formation as well as the cement a phenomenon known as silicaalkali reaction 5 For salt laden cement slurries to be pumpable, which in some cases can be very difficult, it is generally necessary to add to the slurries large quantities of plastifiers acting as retarders. Accordingly, the slurry has a tendency to gel rather than setting normally, and even such gelling takes place only after an extended period of thickening.Consequently, there is a long period during which the slurry is not liquid and barely transfers the hydrostatic pressure to the formation. Furthermore, this slurry is not yet strong enough to support and protect the tubing. Since the salt formations traversed by the drill hole are highly plastic and can easily flow into the well hole by geostatic pressure, there is obviously a risk of premature collapse of the well tubing. Thus, although this solution may appear logical, it actually involves more drawbacks than advantages. The second prior art solution consists in using cement slurries containing little or no salt. This technique is more recent. It is much easier to control the properties of this type of cement slurry. The main drawbacks of these slurries are 1 In order to reduce the quantity of salts incorporated into the cement by abrasion of the rock, the slurry must be pumped into the well very slowly. 2 Despite this precaution however, dissolutions will occur locally, such that high concentrations of salts will develop. Given that salt concentrations of less than 15 by weight of mix water have an accelerating effect on cement setting, it is necessary, in order to avoid premature setting, either to premix a certain quantity of salts with the slurry, or to use retarders. Both of these alternatives, if implemented, at best only enable determination of the minimum thickening time. As an absorption of salts occurs during displacement and setting of the slurry, thickening time will increase in an unpredictable manner. Salt free or low salt cement slurries exhibit a high capacity for dissolving the salts which may be present in the surrounding rocks. Thus, during thickening of the slurry facing a salt zone, the slurry s liquid phase will still act to dissolve certain quantities of salts, such that a void will appear between the cement and the rocks that brings about poor bonding between the cement and the adjoining formation. Therefore, although such slurries containing little or no salt improve certain cementing characteristics in salt zones, this technique is also less than satisfactory and is limited to just a few specific applications. It should also be noted that these two known techniques cannot be utilized when salts of magnesium are present in the rock. A new technique has recently been developed as perFrench patent application FR A 83 233 by same Applicant . The cementing slurries according to this technique have a low salt content and contain a silicate which effects a very unique fibrous bond between the rock and the cement. These slurries also have a good rheology, good compressive strength and an adjustable setting time. The present invention concerns a cement slurry composition having the same fibrous bonding capability as the slurries just mentioned, combined with excellent fluid loss control. Fluid loss is understood to correspond to the passage, and therefore the loss, of the cement slurry s intersticial water into the formations surrounding the hole. This brings about a profound change in the characteristics of the slurry density, rheology, setting time and so on which cannot be countered from the surface and which can defeat cementing operations or make necessary additional, secondary cementing work. Fluid loss control is therefore an essential property of the cement slurries under consideration. More information on this matter can be found in French patent applications Nos. 83 1369 and 84 13788 by same Applicant and it is not deemed necessary to review the teachings of theseFrench patent specifications in detail. It needs only to be pointed out that the fluid loss control additives for cement compositions described in the said patent applications consist in the product of the hot processing,in the presence of at least one acid especially hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid , of an aqueous solution of at least one terpolymer, consisting of theEMI3.1 monomer fractions L I bis II and III described in the following Drawing sheet. paye 4 is cancelled in which RI and R2 represent H or C R3 R3 stands for CONH2, CN or COOCH3, R4 stands for H, CH3 or C2H5 and R5 stands for H, CH3 or C2H5, or alternatively, R4 and R5 together form a propylene group which, together with the NCO group, forms a pyrrolidone radical, the Me chary balancing cation being selected from among NH4 , K , Na or Li and the respective parts by weight of the starting monomers x, y and z for the formulas I, I bis, II and III range respectively from 5 to 50, 25 to 92 and 3 to 70, to which said aqueous solution will preferably be added a compound such as NaF or KF. Moreover, R3 may be extended to R3 COOH, COONa and other salts, and ethyl, propyle esters and so on. The additives described in the above mentioned patent applications and their extensions as described shall be referred to hereinafter as terpolymers . It was envisages to associate the teaching of French application FR A 83 20303. fibrous bonding technique with the teaching according to which terpolvmers enhance fluid loss control. It was found however that the association thus obtained did not provide the expected properties of binding and fluid loss control cf. the examples given hereinafter . The present invention on the other hand concerns a composition of Portland cement slurry characterized by the combination of four additives in set proportions. For convenience, these additives or admixtures will be designated throughout the following description as mixture of lignosulfonate and Na silicate in a ratio of 1 100 to 1 2 3 The ratio will be adjusted on the basis of simple tests of setting delay and mixability Terpolymers as defined above A3 sodium salt of the naphthalenesulfonic acid formaldehyde condensation product A4 NaCl. Roughly, Al Terpolymers A4 represents the above mentioned attempt to combine the teachings of French patent applications 83.20303, 83. 31369 and 84.13788. As will be apparent from the examples given hereinafter, the properties resulting from such a combination turned out to be very unfavorable. Inclusion of a fourth additive, namely A3 above, leads to outstanding fluid loss control provided the concentration of this additive exceeds a certain threshold as explained later herein.Moreover, the quality of the cement rock fibrous bond, the rheology of the slurry and compressive strength remain excellent. Finally, the outstanding fluid loss control obtained by the invention does not entail an unacceptable delay of setting as happens with the prior art fluid loss control agents . Also, as the examples will show, if agent A3 is kept, but the terpolymers eliminated, the properties again become very unfavorable. The conclusion which can be drawn from the foregoing is that the terpolymers, for reasons as yet unknown, do not, in the presence of Al and A4, fulfill the anticipated function of a fluid loss control agent, but that this function is restored and even amplified by the combination with A3. Additive A3 is a product well known for its dispersant properties. Nevertheless, when employed in heavy concentrations in salty slurries of the density under consideration, as documented inTable III following, it leads to an overdispersion which causes sedimentation of the cement, and thus to the appearance of free water, which cannot be allowed. What has been learned from the prior art, therefore, is that the use of this product in salt laden media and in heavy concentrations was known to be very detrimental. The invention is thus based upon the discovery of a interreaction between the terpolymer agents and additive A3, which combine to produce, in the salty slurries considered here, an outstanding fluid loss control effect without augmenting setting time. The compositions according to the invention comply with the formulations set forth in th chart which follows, giving the recommended amounts of each additive in liters per metric ton of cement l t , or in percent by weight of fresh water BWC40 or percent by weight of cement BWOC . The preferred ratios are given in the right hand column.API CLASS G PORTLAND CEMENTEMI5.1 tb Al SEP l t SEP 62 SEP SEP 72 SEP 70 tb Terpolymers SEP l t SEP 13 SEP SEP 26 SEP 13 tb Ar SEP l t SEP 40 SEP SEP 100 SEP 44 SEP SEP 60 tb A4 SEP BWOW SEP 25 SEP SEP 37 SEP 25 SEP SEP 30 tb NiCl2 SEP BWOC SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 tb or SEP CaCl2 SEP 1.5 SEP SEP 2 SEP 1.5 SEP 2 tb Water SEP l t SEP 380 SEP SEP 480 SEP 390 SEP SEP 410 tb The use of NiCl2, or C3C12 2 is optional. Their only purpose is to enable a slight reduction in the proportions of terpolymers and A3. If the mixing water is sea water or a brine, the proportion of A4 NaCl can be accordingly reduced. The density of the slurries according to the invention can be reduced by means of a lightening or extending agent such as attapulgite, down to a density of about 1.5. For the above described systems, at a density of approximately 1.9, the following holds true Fluid loss under the conditions of API spec. 1PI, ie.

The examples which follow are given by way of illustration and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.Examples 1 through 8 Table I Examples 1, 2 and 8 are according to the invention.Examples 3 through 7 are given for the purpose of comparison. Examples 1, 2 and 8 demonstrate the excellent properties of the slurries according to the invention.Examples 3, 4 and 5 show that too low A3 content naphthalensulfonate formaldehyde leads to very poor performance in terms of yield value YV and, especially, fluid loss control.Examples 6 and 7 show that the absence of either A2 or A3 leads to catastrophic results.Specifically, in Example 6, a W 1.8 indicates an over dispersed slurry over extended which will deposit, leaving a considerable amount of free water a plastic viscosity of 73 indicates a very viscous slurry poor pumpability and a fluid loss of llml indicates a slurry whose fluid loss is no longer controlled.As concerns Example 7, no measurements were able to be made due to the extent to which viscosity had developed. Examples 9 through 12 are for comparison purposes Table II .These examples show that the association of Al lignosulfonate silicate with a convention fluid loss control agent hydroxyethylcellulose in a salty medium leads to quite unacceptable YV values and poor or complete lack of control of fluid loss.Examples 13 through 2 are also for comparitive purposes TableIII .These examples reveal the influence of 1 the salt concentration in the medium and 2 the A3 naphthalenesulfonate formaldehyde concentration on the action of the A3 itself. As can be seen, the additive A3, when used in a salt laden medium, or when highly concentrated, has an over dispersion action which is not acceptable.
