# Apparatus for and a method of measuring the width of a line.

## Abstract
Apparatus and a method for measuring the width of a line on a pattern on a specimen, in particular a mask or wafer for use in the production of integrated circuits are described. The apparatus comprises photosensitive means comprising an array 13 of photosensitive elements for each providing a signal representing the light received thereby an optical system 10, 11 for projecting a magnified image of the specimen 2 onto the array and signal processing means 20 for processing the signals output from the array to determine the width of a line on the specimen. The array may be movable relative to the specimen in units of distance less than the inter element pitch of the array to enhance the precision of the measurement.
