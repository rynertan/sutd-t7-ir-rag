# Disproportionation of unsaturated acids.

## Abstract
Unsaturated acids in rosin or tall oil are disproportion ated by heating the rosin or tall oil with a catalyst comprising iodine and an iron compound using ammonia, an ammo nium salt or an amine as an additional component of the catalyst. Use of this additional component gives a remark able and unexpected increase in reaction rate and enables the preparation of a disproportionated rosin containing 0.5 or less residual abietic acid, as measured by ultraviolet spectroscopy.
