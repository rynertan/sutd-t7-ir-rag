# THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR USING VARIABLE GEOMETRY WITH SUPPORT PEDESTALS OF MATERIALS DIFFERENT FROM THE BASIC THERMOELECTRIC SEMICONDUCTOR ELEMENTS

## Abstract
A thermoelectric generator in which the effective figure of merit and or the effective power coefficient is optimized by providing thermoelements made from semi conductor mate rials supported on pedestals made from materials having good electrical and thermal conductivity properties.
