# Method of manufacturing contact rubber structure.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing a contact rubber struc ture, colored, hard, non vulcanized rubber materials 11 are injected into cavities 15 of a mold 14 for molding key top portions 6 a mold 16, 18 for molding key sheet por tions 7 is placed over the key top portions 6 formed by the foregoing molding step and a non vulcanized rubber material 17 softer than the material of each key top portion 6 is charged, compressed and heated, so that the key sheet portions 7 are made to be integral with the key top portions 6 .
