A poking system for use in checking the condition of and agitating the contents of a coal gasifier utilises a carriage 22 for transporting a poker 50 around the gasifier from one poke hole 12 to another. The carriage 22 mounts a poker assembly 24 comprising a tiltable arm 30 controlled by hydraulic ram 36 and the poker is incrementally inserted into and with withdrawn from each pokehole 12 by means of a reciprocable slide 38 provide with poker engaging clamps 60 which are operated during the advance or return stroke of the slide 38 depending on whether the poker is to be inserted or withdrawn. A pyrometer 72 is provided on the arm 30 for detecting, during withdrawal, the location of that portion of the poker 50 which has been resident within the oxidation zone of the gasifier.
