# Photopolymerisable materials for use in producing stencils for screen printing.

## Abstract
Aqueous compositions useful in making stencils for screen printing comprise one or more unsaturated monomers, a tertiary amino compound, a colloid, and a water soluble, carboxy or sulpho alkyleneoxy thioxanthone photoinitiator. When coated on to a suitable support sheet and dried, photosensitive sheets are obtained useful for making stencils for screen printing by the direct, indirect, or direct indirect methods.
