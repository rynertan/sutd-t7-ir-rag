# Method of manufacturing a die cast wobble plate assembly.

## Abstract
An improved method of manufacturing a swash plate assembly 50 for use in a compressor, fluid motor or similar device in which a plurality of pistons 30 are connected, by means of connecting rods 11 , to a swash plate 38 which drives or is driven by the pistons 30 . A plurality of piston and rod assemblies are made by casting the piston 30 around one end of a connecting rod 11 which is formed with a ball 12, 13 at both ends, thus providing a ball socket connection therebetween. The pistons are finish machined. A die insert 14 is utilized to locate the ball 12, 13 and rod prior to casting, and is thereafter moved along the rod to contact the other ball end 12, 13 . This insert 14 thus serves to locate the rod section with the affixed piston 30 in a mating socket of a swash plate die. The swash plate 38 is cast about a plurality of such piston 30 bearing rods 11 to a carefully toleranced dimension. The swash plate end 38 of the assembly is then finish machined.
