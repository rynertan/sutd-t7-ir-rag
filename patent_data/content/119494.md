## Description
UREASE INHIBITED UREA BASED FERTILIZER COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION l.Field of the Invention This invention relates to urease inhibited urea based fertilizer compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to urease inhibited urea based fertilizer compositions which contain certain phosphorous compounds as the urease inhibitors, and to methods and compositions for inhibiting the action of soil urease through use of such compounds.2.The Prior Art It is well known in the art to use urea and urea compositions in fertilizers, for application to the soil. The effective life of such fertilizers, however, is of short duration wherever microbiological activity exists in the soil to which the fertilizer is applied.This is due to the fact that urea is hydrolyzed rapidly, and nitrogen is lost in the form of ammonias, when urea is placed under or on the surface of moist soil which contains urease. Urease, a crystallizable enzyme occurring in numerous bacteria and fungi, as for exampleMicrococcus urease, catalyzes the conversion of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The reactions are as follows EMI1.1 tb CO NH2 2 SEP SEP 2H20 SEP Urease SEP 2NH3 SEP SEP 2cho3 tb EMI1.2 A portion of the ammonia thus formed is held by absorbing constituents of the soil and is available to plants as nutrient. However, a large amount of the ammonia may be lost to the air.A further problem resultiny from the action of urease is that the accumulation of ammonium in the soil and rise in problems, including damage to germinating seedlings and youny plants. One approach to reduction of problems resulting from the activity of soil urease toward soil applied urea is to find compounds that inhibit urease activity when applied to soils in conjunction with fertilizer urea. This approach has received considerable attention, and several classes of compounds have been used as urease inhibitors. For example, certain prior art describes various phosphoro compounds which are useful as urease inhibi torts. Illustrations of such prior art are East GermanPatent No. 142,714 212,026 122,177 122,621 and 130,936, and Great Britain Patent No. 1,494,774 describe various phosphorodiamidate compounds as uease inhibitors. Also exemplary of such prior art is U.S. PatentNo. 4,242,325 which describes a method of controlling the enzymatic decomposition of urrea to ammonia and caf bonic acid due to the action of uease which comprises exposing the enzyme to certain phosphorotriamide compounds. U.S.Patent No. 4,182,881 describes the use of certain N diaminophosphinylarylca boxyamide compounds as inhibitors of the enzyme uease in the urinary tract.U.S. Patent No. 4,225,526 describes the use of 8 4 aminophenyl sulfonyl amino 2 napthalenyl phosphorodiamidate compounds as inhibitors of the enzyme urease, and U.S. Patent No. 4,222,948 describes the use of 4 aminophenyl suifonyl amino phenyl phosphorodim idates as inhibitors of the enzyme urease. Still other prior art describes phosphoric triamide compounds which are useful for other purposes as for example, as flame proofing agents. For example, GreatBritain Patent No. 830,800 describes certain phosphoric triamides which are useful as flame proofing agents. SUMMARY OE THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, thee is provided a unique fertilizer composition comprising urea or a compound which is capable of forming urea when subjected to the use conditions of the composition and a urease inhibiting amount of one or more phosphoric triamide compounds of the formula EMI3.1 where in X is oxygen or sulfur R1, R2, R3 and R4 are individually hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. R5 is NR6R7, OR8 or NR9R10, wherein R6 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or aralkyl R7 is heterocycle, aryl or substituted aryl having one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of trihalomethyl, alkyl, halogen, phenoxy, isocyanato, phenyl, nitro, cyano, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkoxy, arylmercapto, mercapto, alkylcarbonyl, isocyano, alkylmercapto, arylcarbonyl, carboxy, carbonamide, alkylcarboxy, NH2 2P O O , NH2 2P O NH , and H2NSO2 is is alkyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycle, cycloalkenyl, alkenyl or alkynyl either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more halo, hydroxy, thiocyano, heterocycle, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkoxy, nitro, isocyano, quaternary ammonium, arylamino, alkanoyl, trihalomethyl, aryloxy, cyano, amino, isocyanato, acyloxy, ONO2, SO2OH, mercapto, arylmercapto, alkylmercapto, carboxyalkyl, OPO OH 2, OB OH 2 or OPO OR OH, OPO OR 2, OSO2OR, SO2R, and ObV2R, wherein R is aliphatic or aryl, or a combination thereof R9 is alkyl substituted with one or more nucleophilic substituents and R10 is R9, hydrogen, or substituted o unsubstituted cycloalkenyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, alkyl, aryl or alkaryl wherein permissible substituents are one or more trihalomethyl, alkyl, halogen, naphthoxy, phenoxy, arylcarbonyl, phenyl, nitro, cyano, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylmercapto, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, carboxy arylamino, diarylamino, or carbonamide groups.Hereinafter, the aforementioned compounds are referred to as phosphoro compounds Nucleophilic substituents are well known to those of skill in the chemical arts and as used herein are groups which are Lewis bases which can donate electrons. Such groups are described in great detail inMarch, Jerry, Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions,Mechanisms and Structure , McGraw Hill Book Company,Inc., 1968, pp. 199 and 200, and Hine, Jack, PhysicalOrganic Chemistry , McGraw Hill Book Company, Inc., 1956, pp. 46 and 47, and 86 to 88. Another aspect of this invention relates to a method of enhancing the yield of plants which comprises applying the composition of this invention to a plant growth medium within reach of the plant s root system, hereinafter referred to as root zone . The term plant growth medium as herein employed refers to various natural and artificial media which support plant growth, including soil, potting mixtures of oryanic and inorganic matter, and artificial media such a polyurethane foams. Yet another aspect of this invention relates to a method of inhibiting the action of urease against urea applied to a plant growth medium containing the said urease, which method comprises applying to said medium a urease inhibiting effective amount of one o more phosphoro compounds. Still another aspect of this invention relates to a composition comprising a urease inhibiting effective amount of one o more phosphoro compounds, which composition is useful for carrying out the aforementioned method. As used herein urease inhibiting effective amount is an amount of one o more of the said phosphoro compounds which when admixed with urea or a compound capable of forming urea in situ under the use conditions of the compound o applied to a plant growth medium before, after or in conjunction with application of urea or one or more urea precursor compounds to the said plant growth medium is capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of urease that may be in the medium to any extent. It has been discovered by distributing a urease inhibiting effective amount of one or more of the phosphoro compounds in a plant growth medium the urease catalyzed hydrolysis of urea to ammonia is suppressed thereby preventing the rapid loss of urea from the medium. Furthermore, by proper distribution of the one or more phosphoro compounds this action of inhibiting the urease catalyzed hydrolysis of urea to ammonia is effective over a prolonged period of time. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a graph of urea hydrolyzed vs. time at 350C using 10 micrograms of the urease inhibitor Nmethyl N 4 nitrophenyl phosphoric triamide per gram of soil. Figure 2 is a graph of urea hydrolyzed as a function of time at 350C using 10 micrograms of the urease inhibitor N 2 chloroethyl phosphoric triamide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The application and or distribution of a urease inhibiting effective amount of one o more of the aboveidentified phosphoro compounds to a plant growth medium is essential for the practice of this invention.Preferably, the amount of the phosphoro compounds employed is sufficient to inhibit the urease catalyzed hydrolysis of substantially all urea present in the composition. Usually, an acceptable level of urease inhibition can be achieved if the composition contains at least about 0.01 parts by weight of said one or more phosphoro compounds per one million parts by weight of soil or other plant growth medium. Hereinafter the abbreviation p.p.m. is used to refer to parts by weight of one or more phosphoro compounds per one million parts by weight of plant growth medium. In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the amount ot said one or more phosphoro compounds distributed in the said medium is from about 0.01 p.p.m. to about 5,000 p.p.m., and in the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention is from about 0.2 p.p.m to about 1,000 p.p.m.Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, most preferred are those embodiments of the invention in which the amount of said one or more phosphoro compounds distributed in said medium is from about 1 p.p.m. to about 500 p.p.m. Within the aforementioned limitations, the preferred amounts of the one or more phosphoo compounds impregnated o distributed in the plant growth medium are dependent upon the particular situation. Thus in determining the amount to be employed, consideration is made not only of the treatment need, i.e., soil pH, temperature, soil type, etc., but also of the mode of application to soil. When the one or more phosphoro compounds are to be applied in a broadcast application, the amount in p.p.m. may frequently be less than in row or band application where, for a substantial depth and width within the vicinity of application, there can be a very high concentration of the one or more such compounds.When application is made near the root zone or growing plants or when application is made immediately prior to seeding or transplanting, the amounts supplied are frequently at a lower rate than when application is made at the end of the growing season to prepare the soil for the following season. By dispersing vey larye dosages in growth media, a prolonyed inhibition of urease activity can be obtained over a period of many months. The concentration of the one or more phosphoro compounds is eventually reduced to a minimum by decomposition in the soil. In one method for carrying out the present invention, one or more phosphoro compounds are distributed throughout the plant growth media in a broadcast application such as by spraying, dusting, distributing in irrigation water and the like. In such application, the one or more phosphoro compounds are supplied in amounts sufficient to permeate the growing area of soil with a urease inhibiting effective amount of such phosphoro compounds. In field administration, the one or more phosphoro compounds can be distributed in the plant growth medium in the amount and through such cross section of the medium as to provide for the presence therein of a urease inhibiting effective amount of the one o more phosphoric compounds.It is usually preferred that the one or more phosphoro compounds be distributed in the plant growth medium to a depth of at least two inches below the surface of the plant growth medium. In another method for carrying out the present invention, one o more phosphoro compounds are adminis tered to growth medium in a band o row application. In such application, administration is made with or without carrier in amounts sufficient to supply to soil or growth medium a urease inhibiting effective amount of the one or more phosphoro compounds. After administration with or without discing or dragging, subsequent irrigation or rainfall distributes the one o more phosphoro compounds throughout the plant growth medium. In one embodiment of the present invention, the one or moe phosphoro compounds are distributed throughout the growth media prior to seeding o transplanting the desired crop plant. In another embodiment, the soil are the root zone of growing plants is treated with the one o more phosphoro compounds in an amount effective to inhibit the action of urease, but sublethal to plant growth. By following such practice, no adverse effect is exerted by the one or more phosphoro compounds upon growth of seeds or plants. Oftentimes, it is desirable to treat the soil adjacent to plants, and this procedure may be carried out conveniently in side dressing operations. In a further embodiment of the invention, soil o other plant growth medium is treated with one o more phosphoro compounds following harvest or after, following to prevent rapid loss of urea, and to prevent buildup of soil urease. Such practice conserves the soil nitrogen for the following growing season. In such application, the upper limit is primarily an economic consideration. In an additional embodiment, the soil or plant growth medium is impregnated with the one or more phosphoro compounds in conjunction with the application of urea or one or more urrea precursor compounds capable of forming urea in situ on application to the plant growth medium. Urea is a well known, commercially available compound and will not be discussed herein in detail. Illustrative of compounds which are believed to form urea on addition to the soil and are water soluble and formaldehyde condensation products, as for example methylolureas, methyleneureas and mixtures thereof.These products and a method for their preparation is described in detail in Justice U.S. Patent No.3,462,256. Still other useful sources of urea are wate insoluble urea formaldehyde condensation products such as ureaform. Illustrative of useful waterinsoluble urea and formaldehyde condensation products are those whose preparation and use are described in detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,677,746 and 4,033,745. The amount of urea or urea precursor compound included in the composition of this invention is not critical to the unique advantages thereof, and any amount known to those of skill in the art for use in fertilizers can be used. Normally, the amount employed will vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the times and frequency of application. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the quantity of urea or urea precursor compound may vary from about 0.5 to about 95 weight percent based on the total weight of the composition and in the particularly preferred embodiments may vary from about 1 to about 50 weight percent on the same basis. In the most preferred embod iments of this invention, the quantity of urea or urea precursor compound will vary from about 3 to about 40 weight percent on the aforementioned basis. The fertilizer composition of this invention may include other optional ingredients known to those of skill in the art for inclusion in fertilizer compositions. For example, the composition may include sources of potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, zinc, iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum, cobalt and like micronutrient and macronutrients which may be deficient in the soil. The composition may also include plant growth regulators, as for example auxins, cytokinins and the like, as well as pesticides, such as insecticides, miticides, herbicides, nematocides and the like.Moreover, the fertilizer composition can include sources of nitrogen other than urea, as for example ammonium nitrate and the like, and other materials which increase nitrogen efficiency as for example other urease inhibitors and nitrification inhibitors. The present invention can be carried out by distributing one or more phosphoro compounds in an unmodified form through a plant growth medium. The present method also embraces distributing one or more such compounds as a constituent in liquid or finely divided solid compositions. In such practice, the one or more phosphoro compounds can be modified with one o more additiments or soil treating adjuvants including water, petroleum distillates or other liquid carriers, surface active dispersing agents, and inert finely divided solids. Preferred adjuvants are surface active dispersing agents, and inert finely divided solids these adjuvants cooperate with the one or more phosphoro compounds so as to facilitate the practice of the present invention and to obtain an improved result.Depending upon the concentration of the one or more phosphoro compounds augmented compositions can be distributed in the soil without further modification or can be considered as concentrates and subsequently diluted with additional inert carrier to produce the ultimate treating composition. The uease inhibiting effective amount of the one o more phosphoro compounds can be supplied to growth media in from about from 1 to about 50 gallons of organic solvent carrier, in from about 5 to about 27,000 o more gallons of aqueous carrier or in from about 20 to 2000 pounds of solids carrier per acre treated. When an organic solvent carrier is employed, it can be further dispersed in the above volume of aqueous liquid carrier. The concentration of one o more phosphoro compounds in compositions to be employed fo the treatment of growth media is not critical and can vary considerably provided the required dosage of effective agent is supplied to the growth media. In general, good results are obtained with liquid and or solid compositions containing at least about 0.00001 percent by weight of the one or more phosphoro compounds. Usually, however, the weight percent of one o more phosphoro compounds is from about 0.0001 percent to about 98 percent by weight of one o more phosphoro compounds by weight on the same basis.In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the amount of the one o more phosphoro compounds in the composition is from about 0.002 to about 50 weight percent, and in the particularly preferred embodiments is from about 0.01 to about 20 weight percent on the aforementioned basis.Liquid or dust compositions in which the one or more phosphoro compounds is present in higher concentration can be utilized as such o can be employed as concentrate compositions to be diluted to prepare actual treating compositions. Liquid compositions containing the desired amount of the one or more phosphoro compounds can be prepared by dispersing the latter in one or more liquid carriers such as water or an organic solvent with or without the aid of a suitable surface active dispersing agent o emulsifying agent. Suitable organic solvents include acetone, di isobutylketone, methanol, ethanol, isoproyl alcohol, diethyl ether, toluene, methylene chloride, chlorobenzene and the petroleum distillates. The preferred organic solvents are those which are of such volatility that they leave little permanent residue in the growth media.Dispersing and emulsifying agents which can be employed in liquid compositions include condensation products of alkylene oxides with phenols and organic acids, alkyl aryl sulfonates, polyoxyalkylene derivatives or sorbitol ester, sugar esters, complex ether alcohols, mahogany soaps and the like.The surface active agents are generally employed in the amount of from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight of one or more phosphoro and preferably in an amount of from about 1 to about 10 on the same basis. Solid compositions containing the active one or more phosphoro compounds can be prepared by dispersing the latter in finely divided inert solid carriers such as talc, chalk, gypsum, vermiculite, bentonite and the like, fuller s earth, attapulgite and other clays, various solid detergent dispersing agents and solid fertilizer compositions. In preparing such compositions, the carrier is mechanically ground with a solid one or more phosphoro compounds or wet with a liquid one or more phosphoro compounds or a solution of dispersion of a solid or liquid one or more phosphoro compounds in a volatile organic solvent.Depending upon the proportions of ingredients, these compositions can be employed without further modification or be considered concentrates and subsequently further diluted with solid surface active dispersing agent, talc, chalk, gypsum, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, fullers earth, or the like to obtain the desired treating composition.Furthermore, such concentrate compositions can be dispersed in water with or without added dispersing agent or agents to prepare aqueous soil treating compositions. While the composition and method of this invention are particularly suited for agricultural applications for prevention o inhibition of uease catalyzed hydo lysis of urea, they can also be used in other applications where inhibition of the activity of urease is desired. For example, such other applications include use in animal litters, as feed additives, diaper treatment pharmaceutical applications, urease inhibition in mammalian urinary tracks, and the like. It should be noted that the particular active compound employed in one application may not necessarily be useful in another application.Thus, in the selection of a particular active material for use in an application, such factors as toxicity of the material, the environment in which the material will be used, level of urease inhibition desired and the like must be considered in selecting such material.

The aforementioned reaction is described in more detail in East German Patent No. 128,315, Roth, H. J. et al., SYNTHESIS OF PHENYL PHOSPHORODIAMIDATES. PARTI., Arch. Pharm., vol. 314, pp. 85 91, 1980, and references cited therein and E. Cherbuliez in OrganicPhosphorus Compounds , ed. G.M. Kosolapoff and L. Maize,Vol. 6 Chap. 15, Wiley Interscience, 1973, and E. Fluck and W. Haubold, ibid., Chapter 16. Accordingly this will not be described herein in any great detail.Briefly stated, in each step of the three step reaction sequence, substantially equal molar amounts o excesses of the reactants are contacted neat or in an inert solvent, with or without a hydrogen chloride acid accepto. Useful solvents include ethyl ether, carbon tetrachioride, methylene chloride, benzene, dioxaner toluene, xylene, and the like. The acid acceptor employed is a basic material which can be either an inorganic or organic base.Suitable inorganic bases include alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbÏRstt and the like. Organic bases which are useful and preferred for use in the practice of the invention are tertiary amines, as for example pyridine, 1,4diaxahicyclo 2.2.2 octane, isoquinoline, trimethylamine, triethylamine, N ethyl piperidine, quinoline, lutidine tributylamine, and the like. Alternatively, and excess of the amine reactant can be used as the acid acceptor. Reaction temperatures and pressures are not critical. The reaction can be conveniently carried out at a temperature of from about 200C to about 2000C, but is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 250C to about 125 C. The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric, sub atmospheric or super atmospheric pressure. For convenience, however, the reaction is carried out at atmospheric or autogeneous pressure. The order in which the reactants are reacted indi cated in the reaction scheme is for illustrative purposes only, and the order of reaction is not critical. The exact proportions of the reactants are not critical, some of the desired product being obtained when the reactants are employed in any proportions.However, in going to completion, the reaction consumes the reactants and the hydroyen chloride acceptor in substantially equimolar proportions and the use of the reactants and the hydrogen chloride acceptor in such proportions is preferred. Reaction times are not critical and can be varied widely depending on such factors as the reaction temperature, reactivity of the reactants, and the like. The reaction mixture is usually held within the desired reaction temperature range for a period of time, conveniently from about 2 to about 8 hours before cooling.Good yields are obtained with reaction times of from 4 to about 5 hours. During the reaction, the hydrochloride salt of the hydrogen chloride acceptor forms and may precipitate from the mixture. This salt can be removed by such conventional procedures as extraction, filtration or centrifugation. The phosphorotriamide product can be separated by such conventional procedures as evapo ation, and purified by conventional procedures such as distillation and extraction. The product separated as described above can be employed in the control of urease in the soil or in other applications in accordance with this invention or may be further purified by conventional procedures such as extraction and distillation.
