## Description
This invention relates to fungicidal aniline derivatives. Benzimidazole and thiophanate fungicides such as Benomyl methyl 1 butylcarbamoyl benzimidazol 2 ylcarbamate , Fubelidazol 2 2 furyl benzimidazole , Thiabendazole 2 4 thiazolyl benzimidazole , Carbendazim methyl benzimidazol 2 ylcarbamate , Thiophanate methyl 1,2 bis 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene , Thiophanate 1,2 bis 3 ethoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene , 2 O,S dimethylphosphorylamino 1 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene and 2 O,O dimethylthiophosphorylamino 1 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene are known to show an excellent fungicidal activity against various plant pathogenic fungi, and they have been widely used as agricultural fungicides since 1970. However, their continuous application over a long period of time results in phytopathogenic fungi developing a tolerance to them, so that their plant disease preventive effect is much lowered. Furthermore, the fungi which gain a tolerance to certain benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides also show a considerable tolerance to some other benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides. Thus, they are apt to obtain a cross tolerance. Therefore, if any significant decrease in their plant disease preventive effect in certain fields is observed, their application in such fields has to be discontinued. However, it is often observed that the density of drug resistant organisms does not decrease even long after the application is discontinued. Although other types of fungicides have to be employed in these cases, only a few are as effective as benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides in controlling various phytopathogenic fungi. Cyclic imide fungicides such as Procymidone 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 1,2 dimethylcyclopropane 1,2 dicarboximide , Iprodione 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 1 isopropylcarbamoylimidazolidine 2,4 dione , Vinchlozolin 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 5 methyl 5 vinyloxazolidin 2,4 dione , ethyl RS 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 5 methyl 2,4 dioxooxazolidine 5 carboxylate, etc., which are effective against various plant diseases, particularly those caused by C.R. Acad. Sc. Paris, t. 289, S erie D, pages 691 693 1979 , discloses that herbicides such as Barban 4 chloro 2 butynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate , Chlorobufam 1 methyl 2 propynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate , Chlorpropham isopropyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate and Propham isopropyl N phenylcarbamate exhibit a fungicidal activity against certain organisms tolerant to some benzimidazole or thiophanate fungicides. However, their fungicidal activity against the drug resistant fungi is not strong enough, and hence, in practice they cannot be used as fungicides. GB A 1215353 discloses certain methyl N phenyl carbamates, their use as herbicides and herbicide compositions containing them. A particular compound disclosed in this Patent Specification is methyl N 3 chloro 4 iodophenyl carbamate. DE A 2817023 discloses N 3 chlorophenyl alkylcarbamates and their use as herbicides. It is however entirely silent on any fungicidal activity. Representative compounds of DE A 2817023 do not show any fungicidal activity against plant pathogenic fungi which have a resistance to benzimidole and or thiophanate fungicides. A typical compound disclosed therein is methyl N 3 chloro 4 isopropylphenyl carbamate. US A 3211610 discloses benzoic and derivatives for treating coccidiosis, including carbamates such as 2 allyloxy 4 carboethoxyamino benzoic acid. FR M 30 discloses the compound toluene 2,4 diethyldicarbamate which has therapeutic activity as a sedative.
