# INFUSION PUMP SYSTEM

## Abstract
An infusion pump system is described containing a valved cassette which is used as a pumping chamber for conducting fluid from an upstream portion to a downstream portion of the system. The removable cassette contains magnetically biased valves at both ends. Externally mount ed magnets bias the valves within the cassette to provide an opening of the inlet valve and closing of the output valve during the fill cycle and closing of the inlet valve and open ing of the outlet valve during the pump cycle. Free flow of infusion fluid is allowed when the valved cassette is re moved from the pump mounting member which houses the actuating magnets and the reciprocating actuator for the pumping chamber.
