# Curable organopolysiloxane compositions containing carbon black, method for preparing the same and method for curing the compositions.

## Abstract
A room temperature vulcanizable composition which is stable under anhydrous conditions, but when exposed to atmospheric moisture cures to an elastomeric solid com prising 1 a hydrocarbonoxy terminated linear organo polysiloxane containing at least two hydrocarbonoxy groups per molecule 2 , an organosilicon compound and or partial hydrolyzates thereof containing at least two hydro carbonoxy groups 3 , a titanium ester and or partial hydrolyzates thereof, in which the hydrocarbonoxy groups linked to the organopolysiloxane 1 , organosilicon com pound 2 and titanium ester 3 are the same, and 4 carbon black which has been intimately combined with or treated with a hydrophobic agent to impart hydrophobic properties thereto, in which the hydrophobic product is inert to the hydrocarbonoxy groups linked to the organo polysiloxane 1 , organosilicon compound 2 and titanium ester 3 .
