# Pharmaceutical compositions containing flavanolignanes and phospholipids as active principles.

## Abstract
The invention relates to pharmaceutical composi tions containing flavanolignanes and phospholipids, suited for treatment of acute or chronic liver disease of various origin. More particularly, the flavanolignanes comprise silymarin and the phospholipids are characterized by comprising polyunsaturated acyl chains. Flavanolignanes and phospholipids show an advantageous synergism when administered together in a weight ratio of 0.5 1 to 1 5, in suitable oral formulations, with pharmaceutically ac ceptable excipients.

## Description
The invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions containing a combination of two drugs, both used in the treatment of liver diseases, a flavanoligna nes and b phospholipids. More particularly, the inven tion relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a combination of silymarin and phospholipids with a high content of polyunsaturated acyl chains. It is well known that silymarin contains three main constituents, i.e. the flavanolignanes silybin, silidianin and silicristin this invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions contain ing, as a component, both silymarin as such and one or more of the three above mentioned flavanolignanes, even though the invention will refer only to silymarin, for sake of semplicity . Silymarin is known to exert a stabilizing action on the liver cell membrane against the poisoning effect of some injurious agents such as phalloidine, amanitine, carbon tetrachloride, galactosamine, and is widely employ ed in the treatment of liver diseases of various origin. Phospholipids particularly phosphatidylcholine, which is the main constituent of all the endogenous pho spholipids are essential for the normal structure and function of the liver cells, intervening in the regulation of the fluidity and permeability of the cell walls. Each liver disease, even of viral origin, involves a membrane damage resulting from an impaired synthesis of the phospholipids or a peroxidation of the same, with a consequent lysis of the walls, and necrosis of the tissue. Phospholipids, which are absorbed as such also in the gastroenteric tract, act directly on the liver cell mem brane, wherein are incorporated to balance the phospholi pidic deficiency. It has now been found that a combination of sily marin which inter alia stimulates the The weight ratio silymarin phospholipids in the combinations according to the invention may range from 1 0.5 to 1 5 preferred combinations contain silymarin and unsaturated phospholipids in a weight ratio from 1 1 to 1 3. Particularly preferred combinations according to the invention contain a 1 part by weight of silymarin con taining 80 of flavanolignanes, with a weight ratio sily bin silidianin silicristin 3 1 1, and b 2 parts by weight of phosphatidylcholine having a high content of polyunsaturated acyl groups. Among these combinations, particularly preferred is the one in which the b compo nent is a soy phosphatidylcholine wherein the acyl groups consist of at least 60 linoleic acid groups. Likewise preferred are the combinations in which liver phospholi pids replace soy phosphatidylcholine, said liver phospholipids being particularly rich in linolenic acid. Non limiting examples of such a phosphatidylcholine are a soy bean phosphatidylcholine known as Lipoid The following pharmacological tests show the acti vity of the new compositions and the advantages in compa rison with the single components. Table 1 shows the liver protection obtained in the conventional test of liver poisoning with CClâ‚„, in the rat. Table 2 shows the protec tion obtained in the liver poisoning with praseodymium, in the rat, by the administration of silymarin, phosphatidyl choline and, respectively, combinations thereof. The compositions according to the invention show no toxic effects. They can be used in form of pills, capsules, packets, or as aqueous suspensions, suitably flavourised. The following examples illustrate some pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, without limiting it. Each 3 g tablet contains Silymarin 200 mg Lipoid Each 1.5 g tablet contains Silymarin 200 mg Lipoid Each 4 g packet contains Silymarin 400 mg Lipoid The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered 2 4 times a day, resulting in daily dosages of approximately 5 mg kg body weight of silymarin and 5 mg kg body weight of phospholipids to 25 mg kg of silymarin and 40 mg kg of phospholipids.
