As for this use the coating to be formed must not be porous, the coating composition does not contain any pigment. Further, the resin is prepared either by first transesterifying an isophthalic or terephthalic acid with a polyvalent. alcohol, resulting in a polyester with hydroxyl and, possibly, ester en groups, and subsequently reacting the polyester with the epoxy compound, or by simultaneously reacting the 3 starting compounds with each other.Regardless of the method of preparation, however, there will never be formed a block copolymer based on a carboxylic polyester and an epoxy compound.The coating composition according to the invention is characterized in that the binder is a block copolymer of the formula A B A m or B A B wherein m and n are numbers between 1 and 20, which block copolymer is built up of one or more blocks A of a carboxylic polyester resin from terephthalic acid and or isophthalic acid and a difunctional hydroxy compound and having an acid number of 10 140 and a number average molecular weight of 809 10 000, and of one or more blocks B of an epoxy resin having an epoxy functionality of 1,5 2,5 and an epoxy equivalent weight of 100 2000.The carboxylic polyester resin to be used according to the invention is prepared by polycondensation of terephthalic acid and or isophthalic acid and a difunctional hydroxy compound having 2 24 carbon atoms.

The polycondensation reaction for the preparation of the carboxylic polyester resin is generally carried out at a temperature of 1400 3000C, preferably 180 6 260 OC, and in an inert atmosphere of, for instance, nitrogen and or carbon dioxide. The water evolved in the polycondensation reaction may be removed in a usual manner, for instance by distillation under reduced pressure or by azeotropic distillation with the aid of an organic solvent, for instance toluene or xylene. After termination of the polycondensation these solvents may optionally be removed from the polyester resin by distillation.The polycondensation reaction is continued until the polyester resin has the desired acid number of 10 140, preferably 20 110.

The term pigments as used herein also refers to metallic pigments, such as aluminium and stainless steel. The weight ratio of pigment to the block copolymer and the curing agent, if used, is generally in the range of 0,05 to 19, the higher ratios being used for generally metal rich compositions, which are weldable if they contain a metal as pigment or corrosion inhibiting compound. The coating composition may be applied to the substrate in any convenient manner, for instance by roller coating or electrostatic spraying.The substrate to be coated is generally of a pretreated or non pretreate metal or alloy, such as iron, galvanized iron, steel, sheet metal or aluminium. The composition may be cured or baked in the usual manner. In the coil coating process baking is to be carried out at a usually applied final temperature of the substrate of about 2000 2800C that temperature is normally only reached by contacting the coated sub strate for a short time for instance 10 90 seconds with air or combustion gases at a temperature of 2500 4000C. Application and baking conditions during coil coating are known to a man skilled in the art and need not be further described here.Suitable baking temperatures for other fields of application are, for example, 120D 2100C, Upon application of physically drying coating compositions or of the block copolymer according to the invention as such, curing generally does not take place at essentially elevated temperature.ExamplesIn the Examples use was made of the carboxylic polyester resins A F obtained by polycondensation of the compounds mentioned in Table 1 in the amounts specified therein expressed as parts by weight .

The coating composition obtained was applied to an aluminium panel in a thickness of 10 Vm in the cured state and cured for 4 minutes in an oven at a temperature of 2800C. The coating applied was very flexible and did not show any change upon contact for over 200 hours at 450C with aqueous ammonia having a strength of 220 Barm. Examples 10 and 11To obtain the coating compositions used in these examples 14,8 parts by weight of the polyester epoxy block copolymers 2 Example 10 and 3 Example 3 in the form of the previously described 40 by weight solutions were homogenously mixed with the components given in Table 7 in the amounts mentioned therein in parts by weight .Use was made of the same curing agent as employed in Example 2. The polyvinylidene fluoride powder applied is marketed by Hoechst under the trade mark Vidar. The polyamide powder, which contains 259 by weight of titanium dioxide, is marketed by ATO Chimie under the trade markOrgasol 2003.
