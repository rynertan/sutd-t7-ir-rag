## Description
The invention relates to a gasoline composition comprising a major amount of a gasoline suitable for use in spark ignition engines and a minor amount of at least one additive. In spark ignition engines malfunctioning may occur when the gasoline air ratio is too lean for ignition. It would therefore be advantageous if gasoline additives would be available which are capable of improving the ignition of lean gasoline air mixtures. To establish the influence of additives on the performance of spark plugs and on the early ignition, an experimental technique has been developed to measure flame speeds inside a cylinder of a spark ignition engine. It was found that many alkali metal and alkaline earth metal compounds, either organic or inorganic, added to gasoline improved the development of an early flame and the flame speed in the cylinder. Use of such metal compounds in gasoline hence improves the combustion of lean gasoline air mixtures and therefore improves the fuel economy without impairing the functioning of the engine and the driveability of the automobile containing the engine. Although the above effect of such metal compounds has not been recognized, it is known that such compounds may be added to gasoline. So, from British patent specification No. 785,196 it is known that monovalent metal salts, including alkali metal salts, of e.g. alkylsalicylic or naphthenic acids can be added to fuels, including gasoline, to prevent corrosion and clogging of filters. And from British patent specification No. 818,323 the addition of e.g. alkaline earth metal compounds to light hydrocarbon mixtures such as gasolines, is known. It was found that alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of alkylsalicylic acids do improve the development of an early flame in spark ignition engines but it was also found that the inlet system of the spark ignition engines is heavily fouled by these additives. Deposits especially accumulate in fuel induction systems of automobile spark ignition engines, when the automobiles are driven under city driving conditions which include a stop and go way of driving. It has now been found that alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of certain succinic acid derivatives do not give rise to any fouling in the engine whereas they do improve the flame speed in the cylinder. The invention therefore provides a gasoline composition comprising a major amount of a gasoline suitable for use in spark ignition engines and a minor amount of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of a succinic acid derivative having as a substituent on at least one of its alpha carbon atoms an unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 20 to 200 carbon atoms, or of a succinic acid derivative having as a substituent on one of its alpha carbon atoms an unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbon group having from 20 to 200 carbon atoms which is connected to the other alpha carbon atom by means of a hydrocarbon moiety having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, forming a ring structure. The invention further provides a method for operating a spark ignition internal combustion engine which comprises introducing to said engine a gasoline composition as defined above. The salts of the succinic acid derivative can be monobasic or dibasic. Since the presence of acidic groups in gasoline is undesirable, it is suitable to employ monobasic salts in which the remaining carboxylic acid group has been transformed into an amide or ester group. However, the use of dibasic salts is preferred. Suitable metal salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium and calcium salts. The effect on the ignition of lean mixtures is greater when alkali metal salts, in particular potassium or cesium salts, are used. Since potassium is more abundant and thus cheaper, salts of this alkali metal are particularly preferred. The nature of the substituent s of the succinic acid derivative is of importance since it determines to a large extent the solubility of the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt in gasoline. The aliphaic hydrocarbon group is suitably derived from a polyolefin, the monomers of which have 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Thus, convenient are polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylenes, polypentenes, polyhexenes or mixed polymers. Particularly preferred is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group which is derived from polyisobutylene. The hydrocarbon group includes an alkyl and an alkenyl moiety. It may contain substituents. One or more hydrogen atoms may be replaced by another atom, for example halogen, or by a non aliphatic organic group, e.g. an un substituted phenyl group, a hydroxy, ether, ketone, aldehyde or ester. A very suitable substituent in the hydrocarbon group is at least one other metal succinate group, yielding a hydrocarbon group having two or more succinate moieties. The chain length of the aliphatic hydrocarbon group is of importance, too, for the solubility of the alkali metal salts in gasoline. The group has 20 to 200 carbon atoms. When chains with less than 20 carbon atoms are used the carboxylic groups and the alkali metal ions render the molecule too polar to be dissolvable in gasoline, whereas chain lengths above 200 carbon atoms may cause solubility problems in gasolines of an aromatic type. To avoid any possible solubility problem the aliphatic hydrocarbon group suitably has from 35 to 150 carbon atoms. When a polyolefin is used as substituent the chain length is conveniently expressed as the number average molecular weight. The number average molecular weight of the substituent, e.g. determined by osmometry, is advantageously from 400 to 2000. The succinic acid derivative may have more than one C The preparation of the substituted succinic acid derivatives is known in the art. In case a polyolefin is used as substituent the substituted succinic acid salt can conveniently be prepared by mixing the polyolefin, e.g. polyisobutylene, with maleic acid or maleic anhydride and passing chlorine through the mixture, yielding hydrochloric acid and polyolefin substituted succinic acid, as described in e.g. British patent specification No. 949,981. From the acid the corresponding metal salt can easily be obtained by neutralisation with e.g. metal hydroxide or carbonate. From e.g. Netherlands patent application No. 7412057 it is known to prepare hydrocarbon substituted succinic anhydride by reacting thermally a polyolefin with maleic anhydride. The metal salts of the substituted succinic acids show the desired effect when they are included in the gasoline composition in a very small amount. From an economic point of view the amount thereof is as little as possible provided that the desired effect is evident. Suitably, the gasoline composition according to the invention contains from 1 to 100 ppmw of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal present in the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of the succinic acid derivative. Apart from metal salts of the above mentioned substituted succinic acids the gasoline composition may contain other additives as well. Thus, it can contain a lead compound as anti knock additive and accordingly, the gasoline composition according to the invention includes both leaded and unleaded gasoline. When the above mentioned metal succinates are used in unleaded gasoline it was surprisingly found that the wear which was expected to occur at the seats of the exhaust valves of the engines, was either reduced considerably or completely absent. The gasoline composition can also contain antioxidants such as phenolics, e.g. 2,6 di tert butylphenol, or phenylenediamines, e.g. N,N di sec butyl p phenylenediamine, or antiknock additives other than lead compounds, or polyether amino additives, e.g. as described in United States patent specification No. 4,477,261 and European patent application No. 151,621. A very suitable additive combination in addition to the succinic acid derivative for the gasoline composition according to the present invention is described in United States patent specification No. 4,357,148. This additive combination comprises an oil soluble aliphatic polyamine and a hydrocarbon polymer. This additive combination reduces the octane requirement increase ORI . The ORI reduction is associated with the prevention of deposit formation in the combustion chamber and adjacent surfaces in spark ignition engines and or with the removal of such deposits therefrom. Although various types of polyamines and various types of polymers can be used, it is preferred to use a polyolefin, the monomers of which have 2 to 6 carbon atoms, in combination with a C The gasoline composition according to the invention comprises a major amount of a gasoline base fuel suitable for use in spark ignition engines. This includes hydrocarbon base fuels boiling essentially in the gasoline boiling range from 30 to 230 C. These base fuels may comprise mixtures of saturated, olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons. They can be derived from straight run gasoline, synthetically produced aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures, thermally or catalytically cracked hydrocarbon feed stocks, hydrocracked petroleum fractions or catalytically reformed hydrocarbons. The octane number of the base fuel is not critical and will generally be above 65. In the gasoline, hydrocarbons can be replaced up to substantial amounts by alcohols, ethers, ketones, or esters. Naturally, the base fuels are suitably substantially free of water, since water may impede a smooth combustion. The alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of the above mentioned substituted succinic acids can be added separately to the gasoline or they can be blended with other additives and added to the gasoline together. A preferred method of adding these salts to gasoline is first to prepare a concentrate of these salts and then to add this concentrate in a calculated, desired amount to the gasoline. The invention therefore further relates to a concentrate suitable for addition to gasoline comprising a gasoline compatible diluent with from 20 to 50 wt, calculated on the diluent, of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of a succinic acid derivative having as substituent on at least one of its alpha carbon atoms an unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 20 to 200 carbon atoms or of a succinic acid derivative having as a substituent on one of its alpha carbon atoms an unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 20 to 200 carbon atoms which is connected to the other alpha carbon atom by means of a hydrocarbon moiety having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, forming a ring structure. When a polyolefin and a polyamine as defined hereinabove are desired in the gasoline composition to be used, it is preferred that the concentrate further contains from 20 to 80 w of a polyolefin, the monomers of which have 2 to 6 carbon atoms and from 1 to 30 w of a C These compounds include the metal salts of succinic acid derivatives, which include the Diels Alder adducts of a polyolefin and maleic anhydride. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples. To show the improved flame speed of lean mixtures tests were run using a 1.3 litre Astra engine which has been modified by a windows containing plate to provide optical access to the combustion chamber of one of the cylinders. The compression ratio for the cylinder considered in the tests was 5.8. The engine was run at 2000 rpm at nearly stoichiometric conditions. After two hours of running, the time T , taken by the flame to travel from the spark plug gap to a laser beam at a distance of 10mm, was frequently measured and an average T was determined. This technique has been described in Combustion and Flame, The results of the tests are indicated in Table I The effect of the improved flame speed, caused by a potassium additive, on the fuel consumption is shown by the following experiments. A 2.0 litre Ford Pinto engine was run some time for conditioning. An acceleration was triggered at 1675 rpm and terminated at 2800 rpm. This was done ten times. The fuel consumed during the accelerations and the average acceleration time were measured. The procedure was carried out using three gasolines, differing in distillation ranges, characterized by the mid points 50 distillation temperature . The mid points were 101,109 and 120 C. The additive used was the potassium salt of polyisobutylene succinic acid, in which the polyisobutylene had a number average molecular weight of 1000, in an amount of 50ppmw potassium. Results of experiments with and without the use of the potassium additive are shown in Table II. A 2.0 litre 4 cylinder Ford Sierra engine was subjected for 42 hours to test cycles comprising running the engine for 2 minutes at 900 rpm at a load setting of 2.5 Nm and for 2 minutes at 3000 rpm at a load setting of 52 Nm. At the end of the test the inlet valves of the cylinders were removed and rated visually according to a scale comprising a set of ten photographs representing different levels of cleanliness ranging in 0.5 unit intervals from perfectly clean 10.0 to very dirty 5.5 . In the experiments a leaded gasoline was used. The additives used were Additive I polyisobutylene having a number average molecular weight of 650 determined by osmometry Additive II N polyisobutylene N ,N dimethyl 1,3 diaminopropane, the polyisobutylene chain having a number average molecular weight of 750 Additive III like additive II but with a polyisobutylene chain of a number average molecular weight of 1000 Additive IV sodium alkyl salicylate in which the linear alkyl chain has between 14 and 18 carbon atoms. Additive V potassium polyisobutylene succinate in which the polyisobutylene chain has a number average molecular weight of 930. In Table III the mean ratings of the four valves are given, together with the mean improvement, expressed as To assess the thermal stability of the alkali metal containing additives 1.00g of the additive under investigation was put into a 5 cm diameter disk, which was placed on a hot plate kept at 280 C, a temperature similar to the valve temperature of the test described in Example 3. After 20 min. the disk was removed and cooled before reweighing to determine the percentage of the contents remaining. A washing procedure then followed to simulate the solvent action of gasoline at the inlet ports of an engine. Thereto, a mixture of 50 w xylene and 50 w of petroleum ether b.p. 80 120 C was used to rinse the disk. The remaining deposits were weighed to determine the percentage of these deposits, calculated on the starting additive. The results are presented in Table IV To show the influence of the composition according to the invention on the wear reduction of the exhaust valve seats a 1.6 litre Ford Sierra and a 1.1 litre Ford Fiesta were subjected to a road test involving 10,000 miles 16,000 km . The cars were run on unleaded gasoline in one series and on unleaded gasoline containing 30ppmw of Additive II of Example 3, 400ppmw of Additive I of Example 3 and 129ppmw of Additive V of Example 3, corresponding with 8ppmw potassium, in another series. After having run for 10,000 miles on unleaded gasoline, the valve seat showed some wear. No wear was detected at the valve seats having run for 10,000 miles on the composition according to the present invention. Preparation of a ring structured potassium succinate derivative. In a nitrogen atmosphere 1000 pbw of polyisobutylene, having an average number molecular weight of 1000, are introduced into a reactor. Maleic anhydride 167 pbw is added thereto, and the mixture is stirred while being heated up to about 180 C. Chlorine is passed into the reaction mixture over a period of five hours until 79 pbw of chlorine has been introduced. The reaction mixture is kept at 180 C for four hours. Subsequently, excess and unreacted maleic anhydride is removed by distillation. After cooling down the succinic acid derivative is dissolved in xylene and mixed with a 30 solution of potassium hydroxide in methanol, the molar ratio of potassium to succinic acid derivative being about 2.04. The mixture is kept for 3 hrs at reflux temperature about 70 C . Subsequently the mixture was filtered to remove any solids, if present, yielding the desired salt. The ring structure of the obtained Diels Alder adduct was confirmed by C¹³ NMR.
