## Description
A magnetic panel and a display assembly incorporating such. panelThis invention relates to magnet√¨c panels.A magnetic panel according to the invention has many uses.A first and prime intended use of a magnetic panel accordion to the invention is in a magnetic drawing board assembly by means of which drawings and other markings can be produced and erased as required by the use of magnetic styli or the like. Such a magnetic drawing board assembly embodying a magnetic panel according to the invention is intended primarily for use as a toy or plaything by children, but the magnetic drawing board assembly may also be used in educational establishments such as schools and colleges, both in place of the conventional blackboard or as a desk top writing or drawing board. In addition, a magnetic panel according to the invention may be used as a display board or notice board on a large or small scale, and also as a pocket or attache case notebook.Other uses of a magnetic panel according to the invention are firstly as an electrical display board, and secondly games where for instance the panel may have a track applied thereto by a magnetic stylus, which track would be engaged by means adapted to follow the path of the track. The magnetic panel according to the invention will also have many other uses which will readily present themselves to persons skilled in the art. It is already known to provide for example magnetic drawing boards. United States Re issue Patent No 25822, describes a magnetic writing materials set in which balls consisting of magnetized spheres are enclosed between front and rear sheets containing a friction lessening solution, said spheres being rotatable within said solution and relative to the front and rear sheets so as to produce or remove a display by means of a magnet tt ht,5h is moved over and in contact with one or other of sai sheets. The spheres are magnetized with a north poie and a south pole, the respective poles being of differing colours, so that as selected spheres are acted upon by the magnet, then those spheres will rotate and present a contrasting colour to that of the adjacent spheres which are not acted upon by the magnet and hence a display will be produced.United States Patent No. 3,103,751 discloses a chalkless writing board in which a plurality of metallic pins are located between a front rigid transparent non magnetic plate and a back non magnetic plate having a plurality of apertures therein in which said pins are slidable from a non viewing position to a viewing position, the pins being movable by means of a magnetic stylus which is moved across the face of the front non magnetic plate.Unites States Patent No. 2,853,830 discloses a magnetic toy in which magnetic particles are movable by a magnetic wand which is movable over the outer surface of a cover of said toy so as to collect and deposit batches of the magnetic particles on selected portions of a figure portion of a base of said toy. With the magnetic toy of this United States patent it is possible to place the hair, beard and other facial hair on said figure. In United States Patent No. 2,589,601 a magnetic slate comprises a shallow non magnetic box having a transparent cover, the box containing a plurality of small magnetic particles and a plurality of light non magnetic particles of a contrasting colour to said magnetic particles and sufficient to substantially cover the layer of said magnetic particles, the magnetic particles being movable towards the cover through said non magnetic particles by means of a magnetic pencil movable over the outer surface of the cover. The display prcduced is readily visible owing to the contrast of colours between the magnetic and the non magnetic particles.United States Patent No. 3,322,481 discloses a fluid containing magnetic flakes in suspension, a magnetic field being generated so that the magnetic flakes can be re orientated to be parallel to one another in order to generate the display. The magnetic flakes are re orien tated by means of a magnetic stylus.Similarly, United States Patent No. 3,229,281 discloses the generation of a magnetic field in a fluid containing fine magnetic particles in suspension in order to cause, by the action of a magnetic stylus, the fine magnetic particles to move, so that a portion of the fine magnetic particles being acted upon by the magnetic field is concentrated to generate the display.Other prior art patents of interest are United Kingdom Patents Noe. 1,306,981 1,168, 17 957,283 and 511,336 all of which disclose the use of magnetic particles, flakes or the like to produce displays.In the above prior art reference, the systems and devices suffer one or more of numerous disadvantages, such disadvantages being complexity of design, the number of component parts required for the device to operate functionally and efficiently, and the resultant cost of producing the device. In addition, in many instances the displays generated are not of a permanent character when required to be so in that the magnetic particles or flakes or similar component parts had a tendency to fall away so that the display was lost.In an attempt to overcome these and other disadvantages, and particularly in an attempt to overcome the latter disadvantage, it has been proposed in United States PatentNo. 4,143,472 to introduce into the fluid a fine grain inorganic thickening agent in order to give the fluid a predetermined minimum flow point so as to inhibit the falling away or dropping out of the display. The flow point of the fluid is such that it enables the magnetic particles to be pulled upwardly through the fluid to form the display , and yet prevent unwanted falling away of the magnetic particles from the display surface. The thickening agents proposea by said United States PatentNo. 4,143,472 are all solids of a very fine grain and therefore of a very high surface area. Their effect upon the dispersing liquid depends upon the inter action of their surface with the dispersing liquid, so that there are two phases a solid and a liquid.The fine grain thickeners proposed by the United States patent are in the form of fine particles which to the human eye are small but which at the molecular level are massive. There is very little exchange between the solvent fluid and the piece of thickener composed of individual molecules. It is a surface effect. Molecules below the surface of the particle do not, and cannot at any time, contribute to the thickening action. The number of molecules in a particle of the fine grain thickening agent cannot have a separate existence of any consequence. The use of solid fine grain thickeners necessitates te use of a micronizing mill to effect the dispersion of the thickening agent, such use being time and energy consuming, and the apparatus is expensive. In addition, strict control of the constituent parts of the fluid is necessary in the system according to the said UnitedStates patent.The mix11 of the United States patent is susceptible tc variations in composition. Potentially disastrcus contaminants such as water, adhesives, solvents etc, wili effect the properties of the thickening agent so that they become inefficient. In addition, the recovery tlwe of the fluid in United States Patent No. 4,143,472 is slo after separation, such recovery time being of paramount importance to enable the panel to be used immediately and repeatedly.The fine grain thickeners proposed by United States PatentNo. 4,143,472 particularly Bentone has to be treated, i.e.it cannot be used as it is mined. It needs to be dried and treated, with ammonia, to make it more effective an since only the particle surface is subjected to the treatment, then only the surface will have any effect on the thickening of the dispersing fluid.United States Patent No. 4,143,472 suggests that a hign molecular weight organic substance dispersed or dissolved in a dispersion medium to give the medium a high yield value will be so sensitive to temperature variations, tha the physical properties of the fluid can easily change, resulting in the magnetic fine grain particles becoming inactive and sedimentation occurring. This has not been found to be true. The recovery time of the fluid is the important factor, and it has been found that recovery tim is relatively slow when fine grain thickeners are used as the thickening agent.The present invention seeks to obviate the disadvantages of the known system by making use of a pseudo plastic thickening agent.Accordingly, the present invention provides G magnetic panel comprising an edge seaed envelope formed or a front transparent or translucent sheet of a non magner material and a rear sheet of flon n.o gnetic material W sheets being spaced apart so as to provide a chamber therebetween, said chamber including a plurality of pockets and a fluid mix located in said chamber, said fluid mix consisting of a magnetic coloured pignent, hydrocarbon fluid or its oxygenated derivatives or an aqueous solution, a surface active dispersing agent anQ a pseudo plastic thickening agent based either upon a micellar system or an organically modified mineral system.The micelle based thickening agent will be selected from carbohydrate esters aluminium soaps modified sorbitols and their derivatives aromatic alcohols and their derivatives soaps of alkali and alkaline earth metals groups 1 and 2a of the Periodic Table organic polymers paraffin hydrocarbons petroleum sulphonates vegetable products as herein defined two component systems as herein defined single synthetic organic compounds as herein defined non ionic surfactants amine and carbon dioxide esters, amides or amine salts of N acylamino acids aliphatic polyhydric alcohols and an alkanolamlne salt of phosphate esters ethoxylated aliphatic alcohols amides and amines derived from fatty acids diisopropanolamine oleate and ammonia cyclic carboxylic acid monoglyceride sorbitol or glucose benzaldehyde stearate soaps and a polyhydric alcohol stearic acid and polyhydric alcohol reduction of chromic irons by thiosulphate to chromium III and a polymer an organicall modified mineral, and organic complexes of zirconium and ammonium act tate, ana h, organically modified mineral based thickening agent selected from dialkyl ammonium hectorite and simple alchols and long chain alkylamine modified bentonit The dispersing fluid will preferably be based on a paraffinic system, a paraffinic water system, or a water only system.The envelope will preferably include in its chamber plurality of pockets for receiving the fluid mix , and will preferably consist of an upper or front transparent or translucent sheet of synthetic plastics ma t. and a honeycomb core located between said sheets, said sheets being affixed to either side of said core to seal the pockets of said honeycomb core in isolation from the other.

In a stil.further alternative, the envelope may be formed as an extruded section of a synthetic plastics material, the extrusion consisting of elongated cells or adjacent tuber formed integrally as a one piece structure, the plastics material preferably being semi transparent. The synthetic plastics material r iic the envelope formed is preferably polyvinyl hloride PVC , or copolymer containing vinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate PET or other similar materials.The fluid may include a white or first coloured pigment which will preferably be titanium dioxide or the opals cence of the paraffin water systems, and black or second coloured pigment which will preferably be finel divided iron powder or magnetic iron oxide.In order to form a magnetic display assembly, the panel containing the fluid mix will preferably be housed in a cabinet or casing. The cabinet or casing may be in the form of a simple frame so as to provide a slate but more preferably the cabinet or casing will include a base and a top hingedly connected thereto and in which the panel containing the fluid mix is housed, the lid being locatable in an inclined or near horizontal disposition or in a vertical or substantially vertical disposition relative to the base.Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a sectional elevation of a magnetic panel according to a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a sectional elevation similar to Figure 1, but showing an alternative construction of the magnetic panel according to the invention Figure 3 is a sectional elevation showing a further alternative construction of a magnetic panel according to the invention Figure 4 shows a sectional elevation of a still further alternative construction of a magnetic panel according to the invention Figure 5 is a plan view to a reduced scale of a desk top drawing or display assembly incorporating a magnetic panel according to the invention Figure 6 is a side elevation of Figure 1 Figure 7 is a perspective view of the drawing or display assembly of Figures 5 and 6 taken from the rear of the assembly and showing the lid of the board in the raised position Figure 8 is a perspective view from the front of the drawing or display assembly of Figures 1 and 2, also showing the lid in the raised position Figure 9 is a sectional elevation taken on line IX IX of Figure 5 Figure 10 is a sectional elevation of a magnetic stylus Figure 11 shows the forms of shaped magnetic styli forming part of the assembly of the invention andFigure 12 is a graph of yield stress against yield strain showing the effect of a pseudo plastic thickening agent on a dispersing fluid.Referring to the drawings, and firstly to Figure 1, a magnetic panel according to the invention and indicated generally by reference numeral 2, comprises an envelope 4 consisting of an upper or front sheet 6 of transparent or translucent synthetic plastics material, a lower or rear sheet 8 of a synthetic trn astics material which may be transparent, semi transparent, translucent or opaque, and an intermediate sheet 10 of a synthetic plastics material which may be track rip or translucent and which is vacuum formed or otherwise moulded to provide a plurality of pockets 12 in which a fluid mix 14, to be later described, is located. the synthetic plastics material of the sheets 6, 8 and 10 is preferably polyvinylchloride PVC or copolymer containing vinyl chlo PVC polyethylene terephthalnte pEn or other similar material. The upper or front sheet 6 as affixed, after the fluid mix 14 has been inserted into the pockets 12, to tho intermediate sheet 10 preferably by means of an acresi Je, over the whole of the mating surfaces of the sheets 6 and 10 so that the pockets 12 and particularly the indi vidual pockets of fluid, are isolated one from the other.The lower or rear sheet 8, which may also be affixed by means of an adhesive to the lower surface of the intermediate sheet 10, is provided to add rigidity and to afford protection to the intermediate sheet 10, although it will be appreciated that in some instances, particularly where the sheet 10 is sufficiently rigid, the sheet 8 may be omitted. In addition to adhesively affixing the sheets 6, 8, and 10 in the regions of the pockets, the edges of the sheets will be secured together by welding by the use of high frequency welding, ultrasonics or similar processes.When the sheet 6 is affixed to the intermediate sheet 10, a chamber is formed, the chamber including the pockets 12 in which the fluid mix is located.Referring now to Figure 2, which shows an alternative construction of the magnetic panel, the panel indicated generally by reference numeral 24 consists of an upper or front sheet 26 of transparent or translucent synthetic plastics material such as polyvinylchloride PVC or copolymer containing vinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate PET or other similar material, and a lower or rear sheet 28 of a synthetic plastics material preferably the same as the upper or front sheet 26, the lower or rear sheet 28 being vacuum formed to provide on its upper surface in the drawing a plurality of pockets 30 which together define a chamber in which a fluid mix 32 is located. The lower planar surface of the sheet 28 is flat so as to provide rigidity of the sheet. The sheet 26 is affixed preferably by means of an adhesive, after the fluid mix 32 has been inserted into the pockets 30, to the sheet 28 to effectively seal the pockets 30, and the sheets 26 and 28 are edge sealed to ensure that the chamber between the sheets is fluid tight.The envelope 42, referring now to Figure 3, consists of an upper or front sheet 44 of a transparent or translucent synthetic plastics material, and a lower or rear sheet 46 of a synthetic plastics material, the sheet 46 being recessed to provide a chamber between the sheets and in which is located a honeycomb core 48 consisting of individual pockets 50 in which the fluid mix 52 is located. The plastics material of the sheets 44 and 46 is preferably the same as the corresponding sheets of the earlier described embodiments, and the honeycomb core 48 will preferably be composed of a synthetic plastics material such as polyvinylchloride PVC , acetate and polystyrene or similar flow or injection moulding plastics material or a resin impregnated paper.The envelope 60 of Figure 4 consists of a one piece extruded synthetic plastics material comprising an upper surface 62, and a lower surface 64 between which are located a plurality of elongated cells or adjacent tubes 66 constituting the chamber separated by lands or walls 68 of the extrusion, the id TlliX 70 70 being Ioct c in the cells or tubes 66. The open ends of the cells or tubes will be crimped or otherwise sealed to ensure that the panel is fluid tight.The fluid mix located within the chambers of the several constructions of the envelope will essentially consist of an admixture of a manetic coloured pigment, R carbon fluid or its oxygenated derivatives or aqueous solution, a surface active dispersing agent, and a micelle based or organically modified mineral based pseudo plastic thickening agent. The function of the thickening agent in the device is to counteract the effe of gravity and thermal agitation on the magnetic particles such that they maintain a desired pattern. The thermal agitation forces will tend to scatter or reduce the definition of a pattern which has been pulled to the front of the envelope by a magnetic stylus or the like. A white or second coloured pigment may also be included if desired.The thickening agent, when it is micelle based, interacts with the dispersing fluid to form micelles the fluid exhibiting pseudo plastic properties, that is below a certain shear stress, which is called the flow point, the thickening agent holds the magnetic particles in a fixed position, the shear stress value bein greater than any gravitational or thermally diffusive force. When the flow point, or yield stress, is exceeded, in this case by the application of a magnetic field, the micelle will be broken and the magnetic particles will move within the fluid, whereafter micelle formation will re occur.The graph of Figure 12 which shows yield stress x axis against yield strain y axis shows the effect of a markedly pseudo plastic, micelle based or organically modified mineral based thickening agent on a dispersing fluid. The normal behaviour of the dispersing fluid without a thickening agent is shown by the broken line X. When the thickening agent is present, application of the shear stress will not move the liquid A to B on the y axis.At point B, the shear stress value of the flow point is exceeded and flow will occur, B to C. When the excess shear stress is removed, then flow will stop, i.e. there will be no shear strain. Such ideal behaviour is known as Bingham Fluid Behaviour, and the intercept on the shear stress axis y axis at point B, is the flow point.In reality it is very difficult to obtain ideal BinghamFluid behaviour and the graph of shear stress shear strain is modified to show two parts, A to B and B toC. The first part, A to B , shows a very high rate of shear stress to unit shear strain. At B there is a transition to a much lower gradient of shear stress to shear strain. In short, the liquid is initially thick and then thins past a certain point. When the shear stress is removed, the fluid will thicken again. Tests have shown that the thickening action resumes almost immediately, i.e. the fluid is pseudo plastic, whereas if the fluid thinned and took a while to return it would be regarded as thixotropic.The selection of the particular form of pseudo plasticiser will depend upon the nature of the fluid or solution used, and below are set out particularised forms of micellebased or organically modified mineral based pseudo plastic thickening agents based on their compatibility with selected fluid or solution. The hydrocarbon fluid may be a paraffinic system, a paraffinic water system, or a water only system.

The thickening agents of the present invention do not in any way rely on solid liquid interface interaction to produce the required gelation effect as is the case with solid fine grain thickeners, but rely solely on the formation of the micelles when the thickening agent is in solution or other means.The micelle based thickening agents, whose molecules can exist separately, are organic compounds which interact with the dispersing fluid.t,hrough having two groups composing its structure, one group being compatible with the dispersing fluid and the other group not being such.The molecules of the thickening agents will be of the same order of molecular weight as the molecules of the dispersing fluid, and will form a micelle which is a loose assembly of molecules in an ordered manner with a low energy of interaction holding the assembly together. The micelle molecules will be in a slow exchange with loose thickening agent molecules in the solution. The interaction is a weak inter molecular force which is nonspecific, and the result is a lamellae type structure which is readily broken as for example by the passing through of solid particles but which is readily recoverable, albeit in a different micelle formation.The white pigment incorporated into the fluid mix according to a preferred embodiment of the invention will be titanium dioxide powder, either in the rutile form or the anatase form, and will be incorporated as HOMBITAN R 511 R.T.M. . manufactured bv Sachtleben. which is of verv low toxicitv and which therefore mav safe lav be incorDorated in the panel of the invention.The magnetic pigment of the fluid mix will, in said preferred embodiment, be black and will be finalrdiviget iron powder, that is iron powder produced by the ition of iron carbonyl, with a particle distribution D l o of 4 to 7 for 98 of the powder, the iron powder havinw low toxicity. The hydrocarbon fluid of the preferred embodiment ill be Isopar M, a clear paraffinic liquid mainly composed cf iso forms of the paraffin series. The dispersing agent wetting agent will be a high molecular weight unsaturated organic acid ester neutrali sed with a long chain polyamine amide, which has very low toxicity. The agent will be Anti Terra U. With the above constituents, the preferred pseudo plastic thickening agent is aluminium hydroxy di carboxylic acid, the carboxylic acid being in the C8 to C18 range, mainly with the higher molecular weight. This thickening agent also has very low toxicity. Examples of fluid mixes located in the envelope of the drawing or display board assembly will now be given below, beginning with the preferred constituents set forth above.

The incorporation into the mix of 1.12 wetting agent,Anti Terra U, obviated the need for mixing in a micronizing mill. The incorporation into the mix of the Gel 68 as the thickening agent produces a mix by formation of micelles, and therefore no reliance is placed on solid liquid interface interaction.The fluid mix adequately enabled the iron particles to be pulled up and down to form or remove the display as will be later explained and the suspension of iron particles was found to be good. The contrast between the titanium dioxide and the iron powder, i.e. the white black contrast was found to be excellent, enabling a sharply contrasting display to be formed.Example 2Stock Mix 5.948 by weight Isopar M 66.44 by weight Titanium Dioxide 33.22 by weight Strodex P 100 0.33 by weight Isopar M 76.95t by weight Aerosil 200 1.148 by weight Iron Powder 15.78t by weight Strodex P 100 Wetting agent 0.19 by weightThe iron powder is GAF Type EIt was found with the above mix that the iron particles pulled up and down satisfactorily and remain suspended when in the pulled up position to form a display.

CDE and Enpilan KA2 are surfactants manufacturec by Alight Wilson Limited and Nansa YS94 is an alkyl substied ed ammonium salt of a sulphonated alkylbenzene. The akv gives a fluid mix in which the particles pull up and down, and which the suspension of the particles is good. The contrast black white is good, as is the dispersion.The above are given only as examples to show acceptable and workable fluid mixes, and it will be appreciated that there are many other fluid mixes incorporating an organic micelle based or organically modified mineral based pseudo plastic thickening agent which will work equally well.Heat cycling tests carried out on the fluids, the cycling tests ranging from below OOC to 43 0C with cycle times being 10 hours hot followed by 14 hours cold daily for a period of three weeks, showed that at 43 C the formed display had loss of contrast and dropout of the magnetic particles, but at 350C there was no adverse effect on the fluid mix or on the formed display. At OOC the fluid mixes were found to be satisfactory, although they did have a slightly longer reaction time.When the fluid mix as selected has been prepared, the pockets of the envelope are filled with the mix whereafter the envelope is sealed so as to seal the fluid mix within said pockets and the edges of the sheets are also sealed as previously mentioned.The completed envelope, according to any of the embodiments described, containing the fluid mix, may be used in that form with a co operating magnetic stylus or other magnet, or the envelope may be incorporated in a magnetic drawing or display assembly. Such an assembly is shown in Figures 5 to 9.Referring to those Figures, which show a desk top drawing or display assembly, the assembly is indicated generally by reference numeral 80. The drawing or display assembly 80 comprises a cabinet or casing consisting of side walls 82, 84 each including a respective inclined portion 82A and 84A, and a rear wall 86. As will be seen, the side walls 82, 84 each have a member 88, 90 respectively which are connected together by a cross member 92, the members 88, 90 and 92 serving to support a top 94 when the latter is in its lowered position as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The cabinet or casing includes receptacles 96 for the housing of writing or drawing instruments not shown and also includes shaped recesses 98, 100, 102 and 104 for receiving correspondingly shaped magnetic drawing shapes seeFigure 11 as well as a recess for a drawing instrument such as a magnetic stylus see Figure 10 , and a recess 108 in which a magnetic eraser not shown may be located.The cabinet or casing is preferably composed of a synthetic plastics material such as polystyrene or poly proplene or the lake and will preferably be formed by an injection moulding process, and will in its finished form be sufficientlq rigid so as to be able to support the tcp 94.The top 94 is hingedly secured to the cabinet or casing of the drawing or display assembly 80 by means of dowels 110 or tne like which locate in inverted L shaped slots 112 in the side walls 82, 84 of the cabinet or casing, the arran oment being that to retain tha top 94 in the raised position shown in Figures 7 and 8, the top 94 is lifted and oivoted about the lowels 110 with the result that the dowels 110 move rearsdly and downwardly into the elongate portions of the siots 112 in which position the top 94 is located in the slcts 112 to the rear of the receptacles 96 such that the top 94 is maintained in the raised position. To lower the top 94 it is first moved vertically upwards and then forwards until the dowels 110 engage the shorter portions of the slots 112, whereafter the top 94 may be lowered to the position shown in Figures 5 and 6 where it is supported by the members 88 and 90 of the said walls 82 and 84.The top 94 of the drawing or display assembly is generally rectangular in configuration and is in two identical halves, each being in the form of a frame comprising a rear wall 114, a front wall 116 and a side walls 118 and 120. Each half of the top 94 is formed of a synthetic plastics material such as polystyrene or polypropylene or the like, and will preferably be formed by an injection moulding process. It will be seen that the frame like top 94 has the inner faces of the walls 114, 116, 118 and 120 inclined to define an opening in which the magnetic panel is located, the panel being secured in position between the two halves of the top 94 by suitable means such as dowel pins 122 engaging in recesses 122A, so as to trap the envelope along its edge regions see Figure 9 . The.engagement of the dowel pins 122 in the recesses 122A, also serve to secure the two halves of the top 94 together, dowel pins and holes being suitably located around the entire periphery of the top.To produce a design or display on the magnetic panel of the drawing or display assembly, a magnetic stylus is moved in contact with and over the upper surface of the upper or front sheet of the envelope. This has the effect of pulling upwardly the magnetic particles in the fluid mix, in those regions over which the stylus has passed towards the lower surface of the upper or front sheet of the panel, so that black lines or designs will appear in a white background. The reverse, i.e. white lines on a black background, may be achieved in an opposite manner to the above, by firstly pulling the magnetic particles to the underside of the front sheet of the envelope, and then applying the magnetic stylus to the rear sheet of the envelope so as to pull downwardly those magnetic particles acted upon by the stylus.Similarly, black lines or displays in a white background, or white lines in a black background can be produced by moving the magnetic stylus over and in contact with the lower or rear sheet of synthetic plastics material, the lines or displays being visible through the upper or front sheet of the panel.The magnetic stylus may take the form of a magnetic pen or pencil such as is indicated by reference numeral 124, the pen or pencil including a magnet 126, or the magnetic stylus may be of predetermined shapes such as are indicated by reference numeral 128, 130, 132, 134 in Figure 11, these shapes corresponding to the shaped recesses 98, 100, 102 and 104 in which case the shaped styli may be used to produce shaped displays in the drawing or display assembly. The shaped styli will preferably be multi pole or striped magnets and will incorporate a handle or other holding means to enable the styli to be easily and conveniently moved in contact with the upper or front sheet, or the lower or rear sheet of the magnetic panel. The shaped styli may be locatable in the correspondingly shaped recesses of the drawing or display assembly when not in use, or they may be located in the receptacles 96.Lines or displays on the drawing or display assembly may be produced with the top 94 in the position shown in Figure 5 or in the position shown in Figures 7 and 8.Erasure of the lines or displays from the drawing or display assembly is achieved by passing a magnetic stylus along the opposite side of the envelope from which the lines or displays were formed. Thus, if the lines or displays are formed by moving a magnetic stylus over and in contact with the upper or front sheet of the envelope then erasure will be achieved by passing the same magnetic stylus or an erasing magnet 136 Figure 11 corresponding in shapaato the recess 10 of the cabinet or casing 80 over and in contact with the lower or rear sheet of the envelope so as to pull the magnetic particles downwardly towards said, rear or lower sheet.Movement of the stylus or other magnet to produce or erase a display from the panel causes the magnetic particles to move through the fluid mix in the envelope, the movement of the magnetic particles being achieved by breaking down the micelle formations in the micellebased fluid mix, such breakdown being due to the shear stress applied to the micelle formation by the magnetic particles when the magnetic force acts on the magnetic particles. When the magnetic particles have been so moved, they are maintained in their new positions by the micelle re forming, the magnetic particles remaining in those positions until a magnetic force is again applied.It will be appreciated that many modifications may be made to the drawing or display assembly according to the invention. For example, the assembly need not be formed to the shape shown in the drawings. Indeed, it need not be formed as a desk top drawing or display board, or the desk top drawing or display board may be mounted on fixed or foldable legs so that it may be free standing.In addition, a drawing or display assembly according to the invention may be formed as a slate of varying sizes so that it may be used for various purposes such as a pocket notebook, a games scoring board, or as a blackboard for use in schools and colleges and other education al And like establishments.As regards the magnetic panel itself, the pigments need not be black and white, in that they could be of other colours such as red white, yellow black and so on in which case appropriate dyes must be used. In addition, a multi coloured magnetic panel incorporating more than two contrasting colours may be formed. In such an instance, the coloured magnetic particles would be of differing magnetic moment and or size, and movement of the magnetic particles would involve the use of magnetic styli of differing strengths. Those magnetic particles having the least magnetic moment and or size would be moved first with the magnetic stylus having the least magnetic strength, followed by those magnetic particles having the second least magnetic moment and or size by means of the magnetic stylus having the second least magnetic strength and so on, until all the differently coloured particles have been moved by their respective magnetic stylus.Finally, it will be appreciated that as the fluid mixes in the magnetic panel of the present invention do not use inorganic ground solid powders as the thickening agent, but rather makes use of organic pseudo plasticisers or thickening agents then there is no solid liquid interface interaction, the invention relying on the formation of micelles or other means, the difference between the solid liquid interface interaction, i.e. dispersion of a solid in a liquid, and dispersion of a micelle in a liquid, being fundamental. In addition, there is no necessity to mix the dispersing fluid and the pseudo plasticiser or thickening agent in a micronizing mill, since, if necessary, use is made of a wetting agent to achieve the desired result.The essential and fundamental differences between the thickening agents previously proposed and those proposed by the present invention, are that those proposed by the invention are organic, they are used at their molecular levels and at the same or substantially the same molecular level as the dispersing fluid, and rely on the formation of micelles. This results in weak interaction but the interactions are many fold.
