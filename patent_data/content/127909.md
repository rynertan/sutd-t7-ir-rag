## Description
SYNCHRONIZED INDUCTION MOTORThe applicant names as inventor Jan Martinus van den Ham of Heemskerk The invention relates to a synchronized asynchronous three phaseInduction motor, provided with a rotor fed by direct current with three star connected windings, connected to slip rings. Such machines are known and the circuit connection thereof is shown in Fig. 1. The three stator windings are, for instance, star connected and connected to the three phase circuit the three rotor windings are also star connected. After asynchronous starting, the machine is subsequently supplied with direct current excitation and, thereby, pulled into synchronism with the frequency of the power supply. The brushes that make the contact with the slip rings for the current transmission usually consist of carbon, sometimes with the addition of metal, which carbon brushes are movably enclosed in brush holders mounted on a brush rocker with which they are connected by means of a flexible stranded conductor.Auxiliary devices can be provided herewith to improve the transmission of current or to reduce or prevent sparks or arc formation, such as exposing the slip rings and brushes to a forced air flow and thus also removing the developed heat. Further, measures can be taken to keep the humidity of the air at the location of the contact brush slip ring within the appropriate tolerances. With similar motors, notwithstanding these precautionary measures, serious disturbances have occurred regularly, such as excessive brush wear, burning through of the stranded conductors, extensive slip ring wear particularly extensive groove formation and sparkover on the slip rings because of excessive brush dust. It has appeared that many manufacturers of similar machines were of the opinion that the electric contact with a slip ring had to be made by means of several electrically paralleled carbon brushes, presumably with the intention to achieve a corresponding distribution of the current over these brushes. A practically built construction is thus known with two rows of brushes placed next to each other, each with 6 brushes around half the circumference of the slip ring, each making contact with a different part of the slip ring, which construction is shown schematically in Fig. 2.In that case, the middle slip ring even has 4 adjacent rows of brushes to realize the current transmission. In practice, this construction appears to be not at all satisfactory, as the row of brushes with the highest slip ring temperature transmits an ever increasing part of the total current, which unstable self amplifying effect continues till practically the entire current supply runs through one row of brushes. This row is thereby overloaded twofold or fourfold respectively and will be worn out quite soon. A further explanation of the poor current distribution of parallel brushes or rows of brushes placed next to each other on the same slip ring can be given on the basis of Fig. 6, this being a sketch of a slip ring with two parallel brushes in top view. Brushes b1 and bz make contact with different parts of the slip ring S and S2 respectively and are electrically paralleled. The total current ltot is distributed over the brushes as 11 and 12. The relation between the brush transmission voltage Ub over the patina , the temperature and the current density S is shown in Fig. 7. It is, for instance, the intention that both brushes b and b2 transmit approximately 9.5 A cm2. This is possible if the temperature of b1 and b2 is the same at the location of S1 and S2 e.g. 900C, adjustment A . By a slight disturbance such as a slight difference in friction with SI and S2 , this unstable situation will change into another situation in which, for instance, brush b1 has become slightly warmer. The characteristic is then lower than that of 90 C. Consequently, the parallel brush b2 transmits less and brush b1 more current.As a result, b2 becomes cooler and its characteristic will be higher than that of 90at. This continues until the situationB1, B2 results, as noticed in practice, in which brush b1 reaches a temperature of 1300C and b2 drops to approx. 50 C. At that point, brush b1 transmits a current of approx. 16 A cm2 which means an overload of approx. 70 brush b2, with approx. 3 A cm2, is approx. 70 underloaded. It may be concluded from the above that, because of the unstable character, various electrically paralleled brushes next to each other on a slip ring, do not guarantee reliable current transmission. It will be clear that these difficulties with existing machines can really be traced back to a faulty rotor design and that for machines yet to be built the solution is a rotor, the winding of which is split and connected to a corresponding number of slip rings. A possible construction is shown schematically In Fig. 3. For existing machines, i n particular for expensive machines of high capacity e.g. capacities of 1 MW and more at a purchase priceoff300,000 and more , rewinding of an existing rotor and changing of slip rings is usually not feasible in view of the drastic character of the changes. The invention has the object to provide a solution for the problem as outlined for synchronized asynchronous motors. According to a first aspect of the invention, with this kind of machine, the double rows of brushes on the slip rings are replaced by one single row of double width. This is shown schematically in Fig. 4. Not only does it appear that the measure as mentioned provides a much better current transmission but, in addition, the mechanical stability during running is considerably better. According to a preferably further development of this invention concept, the middle brush rocker is divided into two, and each part thereofIs connected to the positive terminal of the supply voltage via a separate series resistor. This invention will now be further discussed on the basis of Fig. 5.The three star connected rotor windings R1, R2 and R3 of an asynchronous motor for 2.4 and 3.3 MW respectively, which run in synchronization with a rotation of 750 rev min and a stator supply voltage of 6 kV, 50 Hz, are connected to three slip rings S1, S2 and 53, of which the middle one is of double width. Six or seven brushes b1, b21, b22, b3 rest on each slip ring. Brush rockers B1 and 133 of both outer slip rings S1 and S3 are both connected to the negative terminal of the supply voltage V approx. 32 V . The brush rocker of the middle slip ring S2 is divided into two parts, indicated by B21 and B22 and each of these is connected to the positive terminal of the supply voltage V via a separate series resistor R. The resistor value of the series resistors R is practically the same for each and much larger than the difference A Rb in both brush contact resistances at the applicable different temperatures. Thereby the direct current running to the slip ring S2 is distributed reasonably evenly over both brush rows b21 and b22. When for the ratio of the currents 11 and 12 through both brush rows b21 and b22 of Fig. 5 the current distribution factor F 11 12 is introduced, It can be found, by consequent application of the laws ofKirchhoff to the connection, that this factor F depends on the voltage ss Ub between the points B21 and B22, hence between toth easily accessible brush rockers with the nominal voltage UR over the series resistor R as parameter. This relation is EMI4.1 which is shown grafically in Fig. 8. This provides good directions for the selection of the value R. A practical choice may be calculated as follows Assume Ub approx. 0.25 V at approx. 150 temperature difference between both rows . If F must be lower than 1.2, it appears from Fig. 8 thatUR 1.5 V. With a total current Itot 1200 A, R must become EMI4.2 As a practical solution for such a series resistor R, it is e.g. possible to use, each time, approx. 20 meters of single cable of 150 mm2 copper core. In practice, this reaches a temperature of approx. 500C. It appears that herewith such current equalizing can be realized that the partical currents deviate only 10 max. from each other. During operation, h llb was measured between 1321 and B22 and this appeared to amount to 0.15 V.This results in F 1.1 and hence 11 for instance 630 A and 12 570 A. Because the middle slip ring S2 is connected permanently to the positive terminal contrary to theories that advocate a change of polarity from time to time , the wear has become better distributed over the four rows of brushes. This amounts now to only 3.5 mm per 1000 operating hours, which comes to a lifetime of approx. one year. This can be influenced still further by the application of two kinds of carbon brushes, namely a kind with approx. 50 Cu content for the positive middle slip ring, while for both outer slip rings a kind is used of less than 20 Cu, e.g. 17 Cu. For three machines in operation as synchronous fan drive motors of a pellet plant, where the measures according to the invention have been applied, this appeared to lead to a considerably reduced production loss as a result of standstill, while savings in maintenance costs also appeared to be considerable. The brush wear was considerab.y less and, in addition, more even.
