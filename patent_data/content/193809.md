# Solventless process for producing resinous materials.

## Abstract
Resinous materials are produced in the substantial ab sence of a solvent by feeding to an extruder operated at a tem perature sufficient to cause a reaction between the reactants A at least one material having an average of more than one vi cinal epoxy group per molecule, B at least one material hav ing an average of more than one group reactive with compo nent A such as hydroxyl, thiol, carboxyl, isocyanate, thioiso cyanate or secondary amine groups or a combination of such groups per molecule or a material having only one primary amine group per molecule, C at least one catalyst for promot ing a reaction between components A and B if a catalyst is required to effect the reaction between components A and B , and D optionally one or more chain terminators and thereafter recovering a resinous material resulting from the reaction between components A and B from said extruder. This process is useful in preparing advanced epoxy resins and phenoxy thermoplastic resins.
