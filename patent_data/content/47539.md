## Description
Flexible fabric sacle container for loose material and process for the manufacture thereof . The present invention relates to a flexible fabric sack container for loose material, as well as the process for the manufacture thereof. For the transport of loose granular, powdered and so on products there are presently widely used big and strong sack containers made of flexible fabric, particularly polyvinyl, polypropylene or polyester fabric. The common problem of such containers is the lift ing thereof, since the great amount, and therefore the high weight, of the contained product makes it necessa ry to employ mechanical lifting means and, therefore, to provide for handles or other gripping members pro rJerly fixed to the container body. It has not been easy, however, to design suitable gripping members for that purpose, since they should be able to meet simultaneously with several requirements, i.e. to save the fabric from such stresses as to cause a tear, especially at their attachment points, to allow the stable lifting of the container, to be of limited length and of simple and unexpensive manufacture. A type of container includes, for example, four han dles, made of ribbon of proper strength, which are fixed to the container body by means of seams which run along four vertical edges of the container. As a result of their number, such handles clearly have the merit of allowing the stable lifting of the container, and moreover they allow to limit very much the height of the container during its lifting. On the other hand, just their number, together with their mode of attachment to the container body, shows this solution as rather complicated and expensive, apart from the fact that they strongly stress the fabric of the container, with subsequent danger of tearing. Another known type of container, in turn, includes a small string for closing the top of the container, which string, once drawn and tied in the closed position, provides the container with a kind of neck, around which a loop shaped ribbon constituting the gripping member for the lifting apparatus may be tightened and remain firmly attached. This solution is cer tainly simpler and cheaper and avoids dangerous stresses of the container fabric, but, on the other hand, it has the drawback of showing torsional and oscillato ry instability and causing a great height of the container when lifted, which height is a bar for some uses thereof. Taking into account said prior art, the object of the present invention is to realize a flexible fabric sack container for loose material, which adds the qualities of simplicity and low cost to those of stability and reduced height and, above all, is made in such a way as to avoid any risk of breakage due to excessive stresses at the points of attachment of the gripping members. According to the invention this object has now been attained by a container characterized in that it compri ses a single length of reinforced ribbon seamed to the container body along two opposite vertical sides and below the container and pro vided with ends folded in the form of handles. By means of a solution which is very simple as con struction and, therefore, not very expensive there are thus obtained not only the important result of avoid ding dangerous stresses of the container fabric, but even that of increasing the overall strength of the sa sr, container, which becomes supported from below by t le same reinforced ribbon which forms the lifting handles.The latter, on the other hand, may be made of whichever length, therefore also sufficiently reduced to avoid excessive heights of the container when lifted. As regards the stability, two handles are sufficient to assu re the same to the wanted extent. Still according to the invention, this is provided for the manufacture of said container a new and original process, which is characterized in that it compri ses the folding of a sheet of flexible fabric to a dou ble thickness, the seaming of a single length of reinforced ribbon to both overlapped edges of said folded sheet firstly along one and then along the other of the two open sides perpendicular to the folding line of the sheet, said ribbon having the two ends folded and, in their turn, seamed to preceding portions of the ribbon so as to constitute a pair of lifting han dIes, and the management of the folded and seamed sheet up to the provision of a sack shaped container having said ribbon seamed along two opposite vertical sides and under the bottom of the container body. As it is seen, it is dealt with two simple folding and seaming operations, which make the container accor ding to the invention surely valid from the point of view of the cost also. The features of the container according to the invention and of the relative process of manufacture will better be understood by referring, by way of example, to the enclosed drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a container according to the present invention in partially perspective elevation view Fig. 2 shows said container as sectioned along line Il Il of Fig. l Fig. 3 shows the bottom part of the container as sectioned along line III III of Fig. 2 Fig. 4 shows the bottom of the container as viewed from below Fig. 5 shows a detail of the container as sectioned along line V V of Fig. 1 Fig. 6 shows in top plan view the initial sheet from which said container may be obtained by the process ac cording to the invention Fig. 7 shows in perspective view said sheet after its folding to a double thickness Fig. 8 shows in perspective view said sheet after the seaming of the reinforced ribbon Fig. 9 shows a sectioned view along line IX IX ofFig. 8 Fig. 10 shows a detail as sectioned along line X X of Fig. 9. With reference to Figs. 1 to 5, there is shown a sack shapebd container formed by a body of flexible fa uric t collstituted by a single C suitably folded, sea med and finally managed initial sheet. The container body substantially includes two verti cal walls 2 arranged face to face, a bottom wall 3 and two triangular portions 4 turned below the bottom wall 3. The lateral edges of the two vertical walls 2 are joined together by seaming at the two sides of the ae proached edges Fig. 2 , a single length of ribbon of reinforced fabric 5, which also joins together adjacent fabric edges at said triangular portions 4, thereby for ming a short connecting bridge 6 between the latter Figs. 2 to 4 . The reinforced ribbon 5 is thus connec ted to the container body in such a way as to run along two opposite vertical sides thereof and to pass also below the container bottom. Said reinforced ribbon also forms two lifting handles 7 Fig. 1 , which are merely two end portions of the same ribbon, which have been folded as a loop and seamed between preceding portions of the ribbon and corresponding portions of the approached edges of the vertical walls of the container Fig. 5 . The ribbon and the handles thus form a single entity, which allows the lifting of the container by the usual mechanical lifting device, while avoiding excessive stresses of the container fabric and, as a matter of fact, supporting the container from below and thus increasing its stress strength. According to the present invention, a container such as that of Figs. 1 to 5 may be obtained by following a process of the type illustrated in Figs. 6 to 10. Such a process provides that an initial sheet of flexible fabric, illustrated in Fig. 6 and indicated therein by the reference number 1 corresponding to the body of the container, is folded to a double thickness along a transversal folding line 8, as shown inFig. 7.A single length of ribbon of reinforced fabric 5 is then seamed with a seaming line 9 around and a log the two approached edges of each of the two open sides perpendicular to the folding line 8 Figs. 8 and 9 , thus forming a short connection bridge 6 between the two seamed sides Figs. 8 to 10 and having end portions of the ribbon folded and seamed between prece ding portions of the ribbon and the corresponding approached edges of the folded sheet 1 Fig. 5 , so as to form a pair of handles 7 Fig. 8 intended for the lifting of the container. The so folded and seamed sheet 1 is finally managed in such a way as to give rise to the shape of the sack container of Fig. 1. As it will appear evident, the ma nagement consists in moving the two folded parts of tlie initial sheet away from one another, passing the inner part as looking at Fig. 8 to the other side of the U like path of the ribbon 5 and then pushing upwards the lower part of the body 1 with the relative ribbon 5 so as to provide the container with the widened and ribbon reinforced bottom, which is illustrated in Fits. 1 te 4.
