# Vulcanizable elastomeric composition, composite of a metallic material and a vulcanized elastomer and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
Vulcanizable elastomeric compositions are described which comprise an elastomer and from 0.001 to 0.1 gm mole of metal per 100 gms of elastomer, the metal content comprising at least one metal which is an oxidizing constituent and a second metal which is a polymerizing constituent or calcium, said metals being present as a an organic carboxylic acid salt consisting of two different metals combined with one or more carboxylic acids, b a combination of two or more different metal salts of organic carboxylic acids, or c a combination of a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid and a mixed organic acid salt complex. Such vulcanizable elastomeric compositions exhibit improved adhesion to metal surfaces and are, therefore, useful in preparing rubber laminates containing metal reinforcing elements e.g. wire reinforced vehicle tyres.
