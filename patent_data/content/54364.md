# Zeolites.

## Abstract
New zeolite materials designated Nu 6 1 and Nu 6 2 having molar compositions expressed by the formula 0.5 to 1.5 R₂O Y₂O₃ at least 10 XO₂ 0 to 2000 H₂O wherein R is a monovalent cation or 1 n of a cation of valency n, X is silicon, and or germanium, Y is one or more of aluminium, iron, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, anti mony, arsenic, manganese, gallium or boron, and H₂O is water of hydration additional to water notionally present when R is H and having defined X ray diffraction patterns, are prepared from a reaction mixture containing XO₂ prefer ably silica , Y₂O₃ preferably alumina and a 4,4 bipyridyl compound. At temperatures of 200 C or higher, Nu 6 1 is converted to Nu 6 2 , a useful catalyst for xylenes isomerisa tion and the like.
