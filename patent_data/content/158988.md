# Fingerprint photocopy system.

## Abstract
The disclosed apparatus is an electro optical fingerprint photocopier to copy fingerprints of a person. This apparatus uses a camera 20 with one or more lenses 24 to photocopy the impression made by the ridges on the tips of the fingers and thumbs. These impressions are useful as means for identification since no two persons have the same ridges pattern. This apparatus also includes an automatic chart feeder 32 , a shutter assembly 28 and a finger positioning assembly 36 comprising concave convex lenses to position the fingers. The features make possible the processing of an accurate finger print chart in a very short time. The apparatus shall be especially used in the identifica tion of persons, in the military, naval, police and immigration services, and in various commercial transactions. Also, shall be used by schools and other learning institutions for the proper identification of students.
