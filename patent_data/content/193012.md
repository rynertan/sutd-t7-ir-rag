# Printing press and method.

## Abstract
A printing press includes an improved method and apparatus for moving printing cylinders between thrown off positions in which bearers connected with the cylinders are separated and thrown on or printing positions. The printing cylinders are urged to their thrown off positions by springs which, in one embodiment of the invention, apply a biasing force to pivotally mounted support arms for the cylinders. In another embodiment of the invention, the cylinders are mounted on cantilevered leaf springs which urge the cylin ders toward their thrown off positions. A motor is provided to apply a force directly to one of the printing cylinders to move it from its thrown off position to its printing position. The other printing cylinders are moved from their thrown off positions to their printing positions under the influence of forces transmitted between bearers connected with the printing cylinders.
