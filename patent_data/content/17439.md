# Method of coating concrete primed with air curable polymer with latex polymer.

## Abstract
In the coating of concrete with latex coating composi tions, such as paints, adhesion of the latex to the concrete is improved by the use of a primer comprising air curable, water soluble polymer comprising A water reducible alkyd or B linear addition polymer containing pendant, oxidative ly curable groups. Preferably the primer polymer is an acrylic polymer having pendant groups derived from drying oil acid which may be provided by reaction of acid polymer with drying oil fatty acid hyroxyamide.
