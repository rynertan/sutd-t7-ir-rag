# Coarse flaw detector for printed circuit board inspection.

## Abstract
A printed circuit board is scanned by a video camera 11 coupled to a processor 12 to provide a serial stream of bits each indicative of a picture element within a particular scan line. The serial stream of bits is transformed by a RAM based serial to parallel converter 13 and the data grouped into arrays, each representative of a contiguous patch of picture elements composed of n x n picture elements by a patch generator 14 which also computes a binary number representative of the patch. Each of these binary numbers is compared with a corresponding one of a set binary numbers developed in a similar way by a patch generator 16 couple to a memory 15 storing a pixel pattern representative of a perfect master printed circuit board. Failure of the printed circuit board to match the stored master indicates a flaw. Overlapping patches are generated to ensure detection of defects which occur in adjacent patches.
