## Description
This invention relates to a resin composition which can be cured by irradiation of an active energy ray such as UV ray, electron beam, particularly to an active energy ray curing type resin composition which is excellent in adhesion to a substrate such as glass, ceramics, plastic films, chemical resistance and mechanical strength, also has high sensitivity and high resolution as the pattern forming material and is suitable for formation of a pattern comprising a cured film of high density. The active energy ray curing resin composition is a resin composition which can be formed into a solid photosensitive sheet dry film . In recent years, active energy ray curing resins have been frequently used as coating materials, inks, sealing materials, resist materials, pattern forming materials. The active energy ray curing resins as the pattern forming material have been used for preparation of printing plates at the initial stage, but they have been recently utilized also for construction materials of precise instruments such as inkjet recording heads as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 57 43876, in addition to utilization in the field of electronic industries such as printed wiring, integraded circuits. However, among the active energy ray curing resins used for pattern formation heretofore known, particularly among those of dry film type, there has been no resin excellent in adhesion to a substrate such as glass, ceramics or plastic films. On the other hand, those which are known as photocurable type coating materials or adhesives to be used for glass, metals, ceramics are excellent in adhesion of the cured product, but irradiation of a strong active energy ray or prolonged time of irradiation is required, and yet they have not generally suitable properties for pattern formation. Thus, even if it is attempted to obtain a pattern by irradiating an active energy ray in a pattern by use of these materials and removing the non exposed portion by development, it was impossible to obtain a pattern of high precision and high resolution. As described above, in the prior art, there has been no material which is capable of forming a precise pattern with excellent adhesion on various substrates, and which pattern has also high durability as the construction material. An object of the present invention is to provide an active energy ray curing resin composition which could not be accomplished by the active energy ray curing resin of the prior art as described above, which is excellent in adhesion to a substrate not only when used as a coating in liquid state on a substrate but also when used to be adhered in the form of dry film onto a substrate, has also high sensitivity to an active energy ray and can form a precise and high resolution pattern. Another object of the present invention is to provide an active energy ray curing resin composition, which can be formed into a dry film convenient for formation of a pattern, and can also give a pattern formed by curing with irradiation of an active energy ray and optional heating treatment which is excellent in chemical resistance and mechanical strength, and also has high durability as the construction material. According to the present invention, there is provided an active energy ray curing resin composition comprising the component i shown below, at least one of the components ii and iii shown below and the component iv shown below as the essential components The graft copolymerized polymer i which is the essential component of the active energy ray curing resin composition of the present invention comprises a trunk chain having relatively rigid properties suitable for a structural material having graft chains composed mainly of the above monomers A F having hydrophilic property and exhibiting excellent adhesion to the substrate added thereto. In constituting the above graft copolymerized polymer, specific examples of the mcnomers A F to be used for constitution of the graft chains are shown below. Examples of the acrylic monomer containing hydroxyl group s of A include 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate hereinafter, meth acrylate means to include both of acrylate and methacrylate , 2 hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl meth acrylate, 3 hydroxybutyl meth acrylate, 5 hydroxypentyl meth acrylate, 6 hydroxyhexyl meth acrylate, or monoester of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, including those obtained under the trade names of Aronix M5700 produced by Toa Gosei Kagaku K.K. , TONE M100 caprolactone acrylate, produced by Union Carbide , Light Ester HO mpp produced by Kyoeisha Yushi Kagaku Kogyo K.K. , Light Ester M 600A trade name of 2 hydroxy 3 phenoxypropylacrylate, produced by Kyoeisha Yushi Kagaku Kogyo K.K. , and also monoesters of divalent alcohols such as 1,10 decanediol, neopentylglycol, bis 2 hydroxyxethyl terephthalate, bisphenol A and addition products of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with meth acrylylic acid. Examples of the amino or alkylamino containing acrylic monomer of B include meth acrylamide, N,N dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethylaminopropyl meth acrylamide and N,N di t butylaminoethyl meth acrylamide. Examples of the carboxyl containing acrylic or vinyl monomer of C include meth acrylic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid or those known under the trade names of Aronix M 5400, Aronix M 5500, etc. Examples of vinylpyridine or its derivatives of E include 2 vinylpyridine, 4 vinylpyridine, 2 vinyl 6 methylpyridine, 4 vinyl 1 methylpyridine, 2 vinyl 5 ethylpyridine and 4 4 pipenilinoethyl pyridine. The above monomers A E all have hydrophilic properties and impart firm adhesion when the composition of the present invention is adhered to a substrate such as glass, ceramics, plastic. Examples of the acrylamide derivative represented by the formula I of F include monomers having hydrophilic property and also heat cross linkability such as N methylol meth acrylamide, N propoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N n butoxymethyl meth acrylamide, β hydroxyethoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N ethoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N methoxymethyl meth acrylamide, α hydroxymethyl N methylolacrylamide, α hydroxyethyl N butoxymethylacrylamide, α hydroxypropyl N propoxymethylacrylamide, α ethyl N methylolacrylamide and α propyl N methylolacrylamide. These monomers F have hydrophilic property as a matter of course, and also condensing crosslinkability by heating, and will generally form crosslinked bonds by elimination of water molecules or alcohol at a temperature of 100 C or higher, thereby to form a network structure also in the graft copolymerized polymer itself after curing, whereby the pattern obtained by curing can be further improved in chemical resistance and mechanical strength, to make the present invention more effective. Also, to the above monomers A F , monomer which can be crosslinked by ring opening by heat such as glycidyl meth acrylate may be partially added to constitute the graft chains, whereby the same effect as in the above F can be obtained. In addition to the above thermal crosslinking, for the same purpose, it is also effective to crosslink the graft copolymerized polymer with an active energy ray by introducing a photopolymerizable side chain into a part of the graft chains of the graft copolymer in the present invention. As the method for imparting photopolymerizability to the graft chain, there may be employed for example, When the graft chain of the graft copolymerized polymer in the present invention is heat crosslinkable, it is preferable to perform heating after formation of a pattern by irradiation of an active energy ray. On the other hand, also when the above graft chain is photopolymerizable, there is no problem in performing heating within the range permissible in aspect of heat resistance of the substrate, and rather preferable results can be given by heating. The graft chains are not limited to those derived only from the hydrophilic monomers as exemplified by the above A F , but the graft chains may also contain various hydrophobic monomers which can exhibit various other functions as the copolymer component within the range of 0 to about 25 weight . The monomer constituting the trunk chain of the graft copolymerized polymer in the present invention is an alkyl methacrylate having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, t butyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile and styrene. The trunk chain is not limited to those derived from only the above monomers, but it may be also a trunk chain using other monomers such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate, as the copolymer component within the range of 0 to about 50 weight . In the composition of the present invention, the above trunk chain gives high cohesive strength to the composition. The composition of the present invention can be provided in various shapes depending on the purpose of uses such as solutions or solid films, etc. However, when it is practically used as the dry film, it is preferable to use a relatively rigid trunk chain having a glass transition temperature of about 50 C or higher in order to maintain the composition in shape of a film. In this application, the trunk chain to be used may be constituted of two or more kinds having different glass transition temperatures. On the other hand, when the composition of the present invention is to be used as a solution, it is possible to use a trunk chain having a low glass transition temperature so as to give the composition flexibility. However, also in this case, in order to obtain a pattern having excellent chemical resistance and high mechanical strength, it is preferable to use a trunk chain having a high glass transition temperature. The graft copolymerized polymers to be used in the present invention may be classified broadly into those having no curability, those having photo crosslinkability and those having heat crosslinkability. In either case, the graft copolymerized polymer enables precise patterning by imparting form maintaining property to the composition in the curing steps namely active energy ray irradiation and optional heat curing of the composition of the present invention, and also gives excellent adhesiveness, chemical resistance as well as high mechanical strength to the pattern obtained by curing. The above graft copolymerized polymer to be used in the composition of the present invention can be prepared according to the known methods, specifically by various methods as disclosed in Base and Application of Polymer Alloy p. 10 35 edited by Polymer Society of Japan, published by Tokyo Kagaku Dojin K.K., 1981 . Examples of those methods include 1 the chain transfer method, 2 the method by use of radiation, 3 the oxidation polymerization method, 4 the ion graft polymerization method and 5 macromonomer method. For the graft copolymer to be used in the present invention, since the surface active effect is marked when the length of the graft chains are uniform, it is preferable to use the method of 4 and 5 , particularly preferably the macromonomer method of 5 which is advantageous in design of materials. The graft copolymer should preferably have a weight average molecular weight of about 5000 to 300000 and, when used as a dry film, preferably about 30000 to 300000.

The present invention is described in more detail by referring to the following Examples. A living polymer 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate butyl acrylate 80 20 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with p vinylbenzylchloride to obtain a macromonomer p vinylbenzylpoly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate butyl acrylate with a weight average molecular weight of about 1800 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Solution polymerization of 30 parts by weight of the macromonomer and 70 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate in methyl cellosolve gave a thermoplastic graft copolymerized polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 7.0 x 10⁴ this is called GP 1 . The polymethyl methacrylate chain constituting the main chain of the GP 1 has a glass transition point of 100 C. By use of the GP 1, an active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows. The composition was applied by a bar coater on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type to a thickness after drying of 20 µm. The coated film was protected by pressure lamination of a 25 µm polyethylene film thereon. A 4 inch silicon wafer having a heat oxidized film with a thickness of 5000 Å formed on the surface was washed by sonication in 1,1,1 trichloroethane and dried. Then, while preheating the silicon wafer at 80 C, the film as described above was laminated thereon by means of a hot roll type laminator HRL 24, produced by Du Pont Co. at a roll temperature of 80 C, roll pressure of 1 Kg cm² and a laminate speed of 1 m min while peeling off the polyethylene film therefrom. Then, with a mask for resolution test closely contacted thereon, exposure was effected for 40 seconds by means of an exposure light source for semiconductor using a deep UV lamp with a luminosity on the irradiated surface of 8 mW cm² PLA 5 1, produced by Canon K.K. . After exposure, the polyethylene terephthalate film was peeled off and development was carried out according to the spray system with the use of a mixture of 1,1,1 trichloroethane ethanol 70 30 weight ratio at 35 C for 60 seconds. The resin composition after development, was found to reproduce accurately the pattern of line interval with width of 100 µm. Then, the substrate was heated and dried at 80 C, subjected to post exposure of 10 J cm² and further heated at 150 C for 60 minutes to cure fully the resin composition. As the next step, the resin layer was completely cut by means of a dicing saw for production of semiconductors DAD 2H 6, produced by DISCO Co. with a diamond blade thickness 0.040 mm at a delivery speed of 3 mm sec to be cut into the depth to the substrate. The cured film without pattern was cut into checkers at 0.5 mm pitches and the pattern portion was also cut at 0.5 mm pitches so as to divide the patterns. When the tape peel off test was practiced on the cured film having no pattern by use of a cellophane tape for industry on the substrate, the result obtained was 100 100, indicating good adhesiveness. When the pattern cross section was observed by a microscope, the side face of the pattern was found to have a shape substantially perpendicular to the substrate and useful as a construction material. Next, the substrate was dipped in an NaOH aqueous solution of pH 10 and a solution of diethyleneglycol water 50 50 weight ratio , and pressure cooker test was practiced under the conditions of 121 C, 2 atom, and 20 hours. After the pressure cooker test, the substrate was washed and dried on air, followed by the tape peel off test. As a result, in either test solution, 100 100 adhesiveness was exhibited and no denaturation such as whitening, blistering, etc., of the coating was recognized at all, thus indicating excellent chemical resistance and alkali resistance. A living polymer N methylolmethacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 30 70 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with p vinylbenzylchloride to obtain a macromonomer p vinylbenzyl poly N methylol methacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate with a weight average molecular weight of about 1500 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Solution polymerization of 30 parts by weight of the macromonomer and 70 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate in methyl cellosolve gave a heat crosslinkable graft copolymerized polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 7.7 x 10⁴ this is called GP 2 . The polymethyl methacrylate chain constituting the main chain of the GP 2 has a glass transition point of 100 C. By use of the GP 2, an active energy ray curing type resin composition having the following composition was prepared. The composition was applied by a bar coater on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type to a thickness after drying of 20 µm. The coated film was protected by pressure lamination of a 25 µm polyethylene film thereon. A silicon wafer having a polyimide film 1 µm thickness, Photoniece UR 3100, produced by Toray K.K. formed thereon was washed by sonication in 1,1,1 trichloroethane and dried. Then, while preheating the silicon wafer at 80 C, the film as described above was laminated thereon by means of a hot roll type laminator HRL 24, produced by Du Pont Co. at a roll temperature of 80 C, roll pressure of 1 Kg cm² and a laminate speed of 1 m min while peeling off the polyethylene film therefrom. Then, with a mask for resolution test closely contacted thereon, exposure was effected for 40 seconds by means of an exposure light source for semiconductor using a deep UV lamp with a luminosity on the irradiated surface of 8 mW cm² PLA 5 1, produced by Canon K.K. . After exposure, the polyethylene terephthalate film was peeled off and development was carried out according to the spray system with the use of a mixture of 1,1,1 trichloroethane ethanol 70 30 weight ratio at 35 C for 60 seconds. The resin composition after development was found to reproduce accurately the pattern of line interval with width of 100 µm. Then, the substrate was heated and dried at 80 C, subjected to post exposure of 10 J cm² and further heated at 150 C for 60 minutes to cure fully the resin composition. As the next step, the resin layer was completely cut by means of a dicing saw for production of semiconductors DAD 2H 6, produced by DISCO Co. with a diamond blade thickness 0.040 mm at a delivery speed of 3mm sec to be cut into the depth to the substrate. The cured film without pattern was cut into checkers at 0.5 mm pitches, and the pattern portion was also cut at 0.5 mm pitches so as to cut the patterns. When the tape peel off test was practiced on the effective film having no pattern by use of a cellophane tape for industry on the substrate, the result obtained was 100 100, indicating good adhesiveness. When the pattern cross section was observed by a microscope, the side face of the pattern was found to have a shape substantially perpendicular to the substrate and useful as a construction material. Next, the substrate was dipped in an NaOH aqueous solution of pH 10 and a solution of diethyleneglycol water 50 50 weight ratio , and pressure cooker test was practiced under the conditions of 121 C, 2 atom, and 20 hours. After the pressure cooker test, the substrate was washed and dried on air, followed by the tape peel off test. As a result, in either test solution, 100 100 adhesiveness was exhibited and no denaturation such as whitening, blistering, etc., of the coating was recognized at all, thus indicating excellent chemical resistance and alkali resistance. A living polymer 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate N vinylpyrrolidone 90 10 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with acrylic acid chloride to obtain a macromonomer acrylic acid poly 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate N vinylpyrrolidone with a weight average molecular weight of about 2500 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Copolymerization of 25 parts by weight of the macromonomer, 65 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate and 10 parts by weight of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate was carried out in methyl isobutyl ketone weight average molecular weight 6.5 x 10⁴ . Subsequently, to the polymer solution containing 100 parts by weight of the copolymer dissolved therein, 11 parts by weight of a partial urethane compound obtained by the reaction of hexamethylene diisocyanate and 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate to a ratio of NCO group equivalent OH group equivalent 2.0 1.1 was added to carry out the reaction, whereby 30 of the 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate component was converted to the acrylic urethane to give a graft copolymerized polymer having photopolymerizable acrylic ester groups at the graft chains this is called GP 3 . The copolymerized polymer chain of methyl methacrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate constituting the main chain of the GP 3 has a glass transition point of 90 C. By use of the above GP 3, an active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows. The composition was applied by a bar coater to a thickness after drying of about 50 µm on a Pyrex glass of 10 cm x 10 cm which had been subjected to sonication washing treatment in a washing liquid Difreon produced by Daikin Kogyo K.K. and dried. On the surface of this composition, a polyethylene terephthalate film with a thickness of 16 µm Lumilar T type was laminated. Next, with a mask for resolution test being placed in close contact thereon, exposure was effected for 20 seconds with a high pressure mercury lamp so that the luminance in the vicinity of 254 nm became 34 mW cm² on the irradiated surface. After exposure, the polyethylene terephthalate film was peeled off, and development was carried out according to the spray system by use of 1,1,1 trichloroethane at 35 C for 60 seconds. The resolution of the resin composition after development was found to accurately reproduce the line interval pattern with a width of 150 µm. Then, the substrate was dried by heating at 80 C for 10 minutes, subjected to post exposure of 10 J cm² and further to heating at 150 C for 30 minutes to cure fully the resin composition. When the crosscut tape peel off test was practiced for the substrate with the use of a cellophane tape for industry, 100 100 adhesiveness was exhibited, indicating complete adhesion except for the clear scars of the crosscuts. The substrate was also dipped in an aqueous NaOH solution of pH 12 at 80 C for 24 hours, followed by washing with water and drying, and again the crosscut tape peel off test was practiced. As the result, no lowering in adhesive force such as peel off, rising, etc., was observed at all. A living polymer N butoxymethylacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 70 30 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with acrylic acid chloride to obtain a macromonomer acrylic acid poly butoxymethylacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate with a weight average molecular weight of about 3000 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Copolymerization of 25 parts by weight of the macromonomer, 70 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate and 5 parts by weight of acrylonitrile was carried out in methyl cellosolve to obtain a graft copolymerized polymer having heat crosslinkability with a weight average molecular weight of 6.8 x 10⁴ this is called GP 4 . The copolymerized polymer chain of methyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile constituting the main chain of the GP 4 has a glass transition point of 105 C. By use of the GP 4 an active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows. The composition was applied by a bar coater to a thickness of 50 µm after drying on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type . An epoxy copper laminated plate with a thickness of 35 µm subjected to defatting and hydrochloric acid washing treatment was preheated to 80 C, and the above film was laminated by a hot roll type laminator HRL 24, produced by Du Pont Co. at a roll temperature of 80 C, a roll pressure of 1 kg cm² and a laminate speed of 1 m min. On the laminate obtained was effected exposure through a nega mask of a circuit pattern by means of the same exposing device as Example 3 for 15 seconds. After exposure, development according to the spray system was carried out with a mixture of 1,1,1 trichloroethane butyl cellosolve 70 30 at 35 C for 60 seconds. The resin composition after development was found to reproduce accurately the pattern of line interval with a width of 100 µm. Next, the substrate was dried by heating at 80 C for 12 minutes, subjected to post exposure of 10 J cm² and further to heating at about 150 C for 60 minutes to cure fully the resin component. Then, by use of ferric chloride of 45 Bohme, etching was practiced at 30 C under a spray pressure of 1 kg cm² for 90 seconds to remove copper whereby a circuit of copper was obtained. The resist could be used as such for the protective film of the circuit. An active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows. The composition was applied to a thickness of about 20 µm after coating by a bar coater on the same wafer as used in Example 1. The film surface after drying was found to be sticky. Next, a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film was laminated on the coating, and then a mask for resolution test was placed in close contact thereon, followed by exposure for 150 seconds by use of the same exposing device as Example 1. After exposure, the polyethylene terephthalate film was peeled off, and development was carried out with a mixture of 1,1,1 trichloroethane ethanol 70 30 weight ratio by a sonication washing machine for 60 seconds. On the resin surface after development, the trace of the mask closely contacted remained as a fine uneven irregular pattern, and even a pattern of line interval of 150 µm could not be satisfactorily resolved. A thermoplastic linear polymeric compound with a weight average molecular weight of 8.8 x 10⁴ was obtained by polymerization of methyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate 60 30 10 molar ratio in methyl isobutyl ketone this is called LP 1 . By use of the LP 1, an active energy ray curing type resin composition having the following composition containing no epoxy resin and no polymerization initiator for epoxy resin was prepared. By use of the composition, pattern formation was performed in entirely the same manner as Example 1 except for using 1,1,1 trichloroethane for development. The pattern obtained was found to have substantially the same resolution as Example 1. However, when the pressure cooker test was conducted after cutting by a dicing saw similarly as in Example 1, no cured film was found to remain at all on the substrate when the test sample was taken out from the test solution. By use of the GP 1 as shown in Example 1, an active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows. The composition was applied by a bar coater on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type to a thickness after drying of 20 µm. The coated film was protected by pressure lamination of a 25 µm polyethylene film thereon. A 4 inch silicon wafer having a heat oxidized film with a thickness of 5000 Å formed on the surface was washed by sonication in 1,1,1 trichloroethane and dried. Then, while preheating the silicon wafer at 80 C, the film as described above was laminated thereon by means of a hot roll type laminator HRL 24, produced by Du Pont Co. at a roll temperature of 80 C, roll pressure of 1 Kg cm² and a laminate speed of 1 m min while peeling off the polyethylene film therefrom.

When the tape peel off test was practiced on the cured film having no pattern and pattern by use of a cellophane tape for industry on the substrate, the result obtained was 100 100, indicating good adhesiveness. When the pattern cross section was observed by a microscope, the side face of the pattern was found to have a shape substantially perpendicular to the substrate and useful as a construction material. Next, the substrate was dipped in an NaOH aqueous solution of pH 10 and a solution of diethyleneglycol water 50 50 weight ratio , and pressure cooker test was practiced under the conditions of 121 C, 2 atom, and 20 hours. After the pressure cooker test, the substrate was washed and dried on air, followed by the tape peel off test. As a result, in either test solution, 100 100 adhesiveness was exhibited and no denaturation such as whitening, blistering, etc., of the coating was recognized at all, thus indicating excellent chemical resistance and alkali resistance.
