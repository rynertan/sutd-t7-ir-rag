An apparatus for soaking steel pieces including cold steel pieces and hot steel pieces. The apparatus is of the type which includes a soaking furnace for subjecting the steel pieces to a soaking treatment a preheating chamber for preheating the cold steel pieces before the cold steel pieces are introduced into the soaking furnace, the preheating chamber being con nected to the soaking furnace for receiving waste heat from the soaking furnace for the preheating treatment and having an outlet portion for discharging the cold steel pieces and a mechanism for introducing the steel pieces into the soaking furnace and for advancing the steel pieces through the soaking furnace. The soaking furnace has a heating zone for heating the steel pieces a soaking zone being communicated to the heating zone and having a heat source for heating the steel pieces, which have been heated in the heating zone, at a higher temperature than in the heating zone for the soaking treatment, the soaking zone having a ceiling higher than a ceiling of the heating zone and means for connecting the heating zone to the preheating chamber for feeding waste heat.
