DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention and the preferred embodiments shown, Figs. 1 3 represent an independent puzzle aggregate wherein the solid lines of Fig. 1 represent an automobile in three dimensional form or relief generally indicated by numeral 10. Beyond area 10 generally designated by numeral 11 is a lower and preferably planar area, the latter if desired having a peripheral frame and further provided with detachable and cooperating locking means, said frame and locking means being generally and jointly designated by numeral 12. In the second embodiment of the invention as exemplified in Figs. 4 6, independent puzzle aggregates of assembled puzzle pieces and each aggregate being indicated by numerals 34 and 35 respectively as will appear, are intended to indicate as an example the connection of such aggregates to form a geographic globe in relief. In both embodiments, the puzzle pieces are composed of any suitable material such as wood, fiber, composition, plastic, metal or any combinations thereof, and said puzzle pieces may also be contrastingly colored in the parts thereof to make the assembled result more effective. FIRST EMBODIMENT The puzzle pieces in the first embodiment of the invention as shown in Figs. 1 3 each has a ilat bottom to form when matched or assembled with all the other cooperating pieces on a tabular surface a continuous, flat undersurface inside the periphery. The puzzle pieces and portions thereof, forming automobile part areas in the example as shown and represented in the drawing figure by heavier solid lines and curves as indicated by numeral 10 as hereinbefore stated, are of preselected heights, side shapes and surface contours adapted to present the assembled subject or automobile as elevated from the other assembled pieces and parts of pieces to form a relatively depressed but preferred substantially flat background. Thus, a lower left hand corner of the puzzle as best shown in Fig. 3 represents a puzzle piece 15 flat in the instant embodiment and forming part of the background of the assembled puzzle, while the single compound piece formed of flat parts 16 17 18 to form other parts of the background carries an elevated part 19 to form a wheel portion of the automobile. Loose puzzle piece 20 in Fig. 3 has a flat and circular depressed portion 21 with respect to elevated surface part 22 and is adapted to be moved toward and interfitted with the sides of compound puzzle piece 16 17 18 and elevated part 19. The enlarged sectional view of Fig. 2 shows intermediate puzzle pieces assembled as in Fig. 1 wherein piece 23 has an elevated portion 23a, pieces 24 and 25 are shown as elevated portions and piece 26 is shown in both elevated and non elevated parts. Fig. 2 further shows the flat bottom of the assembled puzzle by the general designation of numeral lOa. The puzzle when assembled may have additional features such as a peripheral frame formed from extension structures along each of the outer edges of the peripheral puzzle pieces as best seen in Fig. 3 wherein puzzle pieces 15 and 16 are provided with such structures in the exemplified form of coextensive tenons 27 and 28 respectively. The puzzle further when assembled may have a detachable locking feature to make permanent if desired the solved puzzle as an object of art or utility. Such locking feature best seen in Fig. 3 as an example is adapted to cooperate with the aligned tenon pieces such as 27 and 28 forming part of the puzzle frame, said feature as shown being in the form of slidable longitudinal and transverse mortised locking pieces 29 and 30 engaging aligned tenons on the peripheral puzzle pieces, said tenons in Fig. 2 being indicated by numerals 31 and 32. SECOND EMBODIMENT In the second embodiment of the invention shown inFigs. 4, 5 and 6, a composite puzzle is shown formed of two independently useable aggregates connected together, each of the aggregates being formed of matching and interfitting puzzle pieces of similar construction such as flat bottoms and of varying heights and contours. Such composite puzzle is exemplified in the form of a geographic globe in relief indicated generally by numeral 33 and having independent hemispherical aggregates 34 and 35 connected together at the abutting bottom flat walls as will be described. It is understood that other aggregates of different dependent or independent aggregates may be connected together in the formation of other desirable subjects while retaining the building blocks represented by structures shown in Figs. 1 3. In each of the hemispherical aggregates 34 and 35 a plurality of puzzle pieces have been utilized similar in general structure to the puzzle pieces of Figs. 1 3. Thus, with respect to hemisphere 35 a typical intermediate puzzle piece generally indicated by numeral 35a has a flat bottom 36, flat matchable side or sides 37 and matchable surface and surface contour portions 38 and 39 respectively. The other puzzle pieces adapted to match each other vary in dimension and form so that when assembled present a geographic hemisphere contoured for relief. In this connection, the end pieces 40 and 41 each have flat inside walls and curvilinear outer side walls for hemispherical completion. Suitable and detachable locking means are further provided for hemisphere 35 as by use of a pair of spaced and parallel rods each designated by numeral 42 lying above and adjacent and parallel to the flat bottom wall of 35, said rods being adapted to penetrate alignable bores in the puzzle pieces. As shown, each of the rods 42 has at one end an enlarged slotted head 43 and at the opposite end a threaded portion 44. Each of the slotted heads 43 as shown are on opposite sides of hemisphere 35 and are disposed within suitable recesses of the end puzzle pieces 40 and 41 and adjacent pieces thereto. Threaded portion 44 of the rods 41 are also adapted to engage internal threads in the align able bores at the opposite end puzzle pieces 40 and 41. Similar detachable locking means are provided for hemisphere 34 and parts corresponding to the parts in hemisphere 35 are designated by the same numerals primed. When the hemispheres 35 and 34 are each assembled and locked as independent aggregates, they can be suitably and detachably secured or connected together as by placing their respective flat bottoms in abutment and introducing opposite pairs of spaced and parallel rods running perpendicular to the flat bottoms of hemispheres 35 and 34 and in aligned bores of the puzzle pieces thereof. Thus one pair of spaced vertical rods each indicated by numeral 45 is at one end portion of the abutting hemispheres 35 and 34 and another pair of similar rods each indicated by numeral 46 is at the other end portion of said abutting hemispheres. Pair of rods 45 are adapted to penetrate aligned bores in puzzle pieces 47 and 47 while pair of rods 46 penetrate aligned bores in puzzle pieces 48 and 48 . Each of the rods in pairs 45 and 46 at the opposite ends are also provided with enlarged slotted heads and threaded portions as in the case of the horizontal rods 42 and 42 , as indicated by numerals 49 and 50. It is understood that further means, not shown, may be applied to the connected hemispheres for support and rotation of the globe. It is further distinctly understood that minor changes and variations in the materials used, contours and relative dimensions of the parts, framing and detachable locking means may all be resorted to without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
