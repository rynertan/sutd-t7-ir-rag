# Data processing apparatus having an input output controller for controlling interruptions.

## Abstract
A data processing apparatus includes an interruption control unit having an associative memory which is used to store a priority data of an interruption and a mode data de signating an interruption operation mode. A sequential scanning data is applied according to a priority order to the associative memory. Thus, the mode data required to oper ate the interruption can be selected and transferred to an in terruption processing unit by comparing the stored priority data with the applied scanning data in the associative memory without control of a central processing unit.
