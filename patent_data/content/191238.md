# Pacemaker lead with enhanced sensitivity.

## Abstract
A cardiac pacemaker lead 3 has a structure which provides an enhanced sensitivity to atrial P waves. The distal end 7 of the lead 3 has two sensing electrodes 17, 19 disposed thereon to contact atrial cardiac tissue 43 an to detect near field P waves with greater sensitivity than far field R waves.
