# Split axle drive mechanisms.

## Abstract
A split axle drive mechanism for a part time four wheel drive vehicle comprises an automotive type differential 32 which has an input 36 to the differential case 38 and a pair of outputs from the respective side gears. One output 56 is di rectly connected to its associated side gear 52 so that the as sociated side gear is always drive connected to one selectively driven vehicle wheel 30. The other output includes a clutch 58 which is disengaged in the two wheel drive mode selected at the transfer case 14 so that the other selectively driven vehicle wheel does not back drive the other side gear 50. This reduces wear and power consumption in the two wheel drive mode.
