## Description
HYBRID CELL LINE PRODUCING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY CYTOLE IC TO TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies specific for Trichomonas vaginalis. More specifically, this invention relates to hybridomas which produce monoclonal antibodies specific for T. vaginalis antigen determinants and which are cytolytic to this pathogenic microorganism. This invention relates to the use of monoclonal antibody for treatment of trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis is a chronic disease of the urogentaI tract caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. It is the most common of all sexually transmitted diseases and is responsible for a significant economic and emotional burden among infected individuals in this country and the worid.In women, trichomonal vaginitis is characterized by inflammation of vaginal epithelium, foul smelling discharge, and tissue cytopathology. Most men are asymptomatic.Disease manifestations such as urethritis, prostatitis, balanoposthitis, and others, however, have been documented in infected men. Current ciinical diagnosis of trichomoniasis based on microscopic detection of the parasite is tedious, time consuming, highly inadequate, and expensive. These diag nosis limitations exacerbate already limited medical care in rural health clinics in our country and the world.Thus, basic research is necessary to address relevant issues such as development of sensitive, accurate assays for screening symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients and perhaps monitoring disease progression. The development of potential vaccinogen and antibacterial candidates is equally important and necessary. Further, the emergence of trichomoniasis as a major sexually transmitted disease has necessitated identification of the virulence factors associated wit the surface of T. vaginalis. The use of conventional immunological methods has failed to identify specific virulence determinants or antigens. It, therefore, is highly desirable to provide monoclonal antibody to T. vaginalis antigens. Such antibodies would be important in the differential diagnosis of trichomoniasis disease in humans, in the purification of specific immunogenic for subsequent use as vaccines, and studying the structure and function of immunogenic co pones of virulent T. vaginalis. While treatment of most women infected with T.vaginalis with metronidazole Flagyl or other imidazole drugs is highly efficacious, no treatment is provided for pregnant women. These drugs are known to cause cancer in laboratory animals and are teratogenic to the grow ng embryo and fetus. For this reason, alternative means for treatment are important and needed. Therefore, a monoclonal antibody which is cytolytic to intact live organisms would be important in abrogating existing disease in an untreated human subpopulation. Equally important would be the utility of such a reagent for emerging drug resistant strains. In accordance with the present invention, continuous hybridoma cell lines are established which elaborate and secrete highly specific and homogenous monoclonal antibodies to an antigen of Trichomonas vaginalis. Specific cally, hybridoma cell lines are produced which secrete monoclonal antibodies having specificity for a T. vagi nalis membrane glycoprotein antigen. Of the three hybrid clones screened which exhibited monoclonal antibodies specific for and cytolytic to T. vaginal s, one hybrid line was deposited with the America.. Type Culture Collection in Rockville, Maryland C20A3, XE 8379 . Further, the monoclonal antibodies according to this invention provide diagnostic and therapeutic reagents useful in the immunological detection and treatment of trichomoniasis infection. The following discussion is in terms of the preferred embodiments of this invention, which represent the best mode known to the Applicant at the time of this application.I. GENERAL TECHNIQUES OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PREPARATION Antibodies are normally synthesized by lymphoid cells derived from B lymphocytes of bone marrow. The great diversity of antibody specificities is accomplished by immunoglobulin molecules having many structural features in common. Individual antibody molecules of heterogeneous binding specificity differ in their detailed amino acid sequences and even antibodies of the same specificity are usually a mixture of immunoglobulins having different amino acid sequences, although such sequences may be sub stantially homologous. The terms antibody and immune globulin are used interchangeably herein. Individual lymphocytes produce immunoglobulin of a single amino acid sequence. Lymphocytes cannot be directly cultured to produce their specific antibody.However, Kohler, et al, Nature 256 495 1975 demonstrated that a process of somatic cell fusion, specifically between a lymphocyte and a myeloma cell, could yield hybrid cells which grow in culture and produce a specific antibody. Myeloma cells are lymphocyte tumor cells which, depending upon the cell strain, frequently produce an antibody themselves, moreover some non producing strains are known. Several myeloma cell lines may be used for the production of fused cell hybrids, including P3 X63 Ag 8,F3 NSI l Ag 4 1, Sp2 10 Agl4 and S194 5.XXO.BU.1. The F3, X63 Ag 8 and P3 NSI 1 Ag 4 1 cells lines have been described by Kohler and Milstein Eur. J. Immunol. 6 511 51 1976 . Shulman et al. Nature 276 269 270 1978 developed the Sp2 0 hg 14 myeloma line. The Sl91,5.XX D.BU.l myeloma line was reported in an article by Trowbridge J. Exp. ed. 148 313 1979 . The hybrid resulting from somatic fusion of a lymphocyte and a myeloma ceil is termed a hybridoma cell herein and in the art generally. In a typical fusion procedure, spleen lymphocytes trom an animal immunized against a chosen antigen are fused with myeloma cells,The resulting hybridomas are then dispersed in a series of separate culture tubes or microtiter plate wells to screen or cultures producing a desired antibody. Positive cultures are further diluted to obtain colonies arising from a single cell clones . The clones are again screened for production of the desired antibody. Antibody produced by a cloned hybridoma is termed monoclonal herein and in the art. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against only a single antigenic determinant.Furthermore, in contrast to contrast to conventional antibody preparations which.typically include different antibodies directed against different sets of determinants on the same antigen, monoclonal antibodies are directed only against a single determinant on the antigen.Monoclonal antbodies are useful to improve the selectivity and specificity of diagnostic and analytical assay methods using antigen antibody binding. A second advantage of monoclonal antibodies is provided by the fact that they are synthesized in pure form by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared from supernatants of cultured hybridoma cells or from ascites induced by intraperitoneal inoculation of hybridoma cells into mice. In accordance with the processes to develop the hybrid cell lines and monoclonal antibodies of this invention, test animals are stimulated for antibody production by different immunization regimens and using different antigen preparations of Trichomonas vaginalis pathogenic to humans as outlined below. For example, immunization of test animals was performed following subcutaneous inoculation of live organisms in the hind quarters of BALB c mice. Applicant has directed the preferred embodiment to immunization of mice with a heterogeneous composition of parasite materials, thereby providing a complex array of antigen determinants. Although the mouse system has been employed as the antibody source of this invention, other antibody sources are available such as rabbits, rats, horses, and humans. Of course, the antibody source animals are not limited to those listed herein.Any animal which elicits antibody production after primed to an antigen is contemplated as an antibody source for the fusion process. The route and schedule of immunization of the host animal is as described below. Mice were challenged subcutaneously with a booster inoculation approximately 25 days after the initial injection, and this procedure has been recently published Alderete, Brit. J. Vener. Dis. 60 164, 1984 . The kinetics of the IgG antibody response was monitored by a whole cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Vihen maximal IgG levels were recorded approximately 14 days after the booster injection, mice were inoculated again. Three or four days after this last challenge, mice spleens were used for generation of hybridomas as described below. Otherwise, procedures are in keeping with established and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and production. After immuni ation, immune lymphoid cells are fused with myeloma, plasmacytoma, or hybridoma cells hereinafter referred to collectively as myeloma cells to generate a hybrid cell line which can be cultivated and sub cultvated indefinitely, to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibodies. For purpose O this invention, the immune lymphoid cells selected for fusion are lymphocytes and their normal differentiated progeny, taken either from lymph node tissue cr spleen tissue from immunized animals. Applicant prefers te employ immune spleen cells, since they offer a more concentrated and convenient source of antibody producing cells with respect to the mouse system. The myeloma cells provide the basis for continuous propagation of the fused hybrid, Myeloma cells are tumor cells derived from plasma cells which show preference for bone marrow. Plasmacytoma cells are neoplastic cells derived from plasma cells. In particular, Applicant prefers to use lymphocyte hybridoma cells which secrete no immunoglobulin. Lymphocyte hybridoma cells are cells generated by the fusion of myeloma or plasmacytoma cells with normal differentiated lymphoid cells. Myeloma, plas macytoma, and hybridomas can be selected to be devoid of immunoglobulin synthesis. The particular species of animal from which the myeloma and immunized antibody producing cells are derived are not critical, in that it is possible to fuse cells of one species with another. However, it is preferred that the source of immunized antibody producing cells and myeloma be from the same species. Generally the fusion techniques employed are according to the procedures set out by Kohler et al, Eur. J.Immunol. 6 11 19 1976 and Kennett et al, LymphocyteHybridomas Current ToPics in Microbiology and Immunology 81 77 91 197 Springer Verlag, New York. Fusion is generally accomplished by centrifuging the myeloma cells with a suspension of antibody producing cells and growth medium to form a pellet. The fused hybrids are next screened for antibody production specific for T. vaginalis surface antigens.The membrane specific monoclonal antibodies obtained according to preferred examples include antibodies with individual specificity for the numerous antigenic components of the membrane, including lipids, glycoprotein and protein antigenic determinants. The hybridomas which secrete antibody specific for T.vaginalis membrane antigens are cultured to establish a continuous cell line with stable genetic coding. These cell lines can be stored and preserved in any of a number of convent onal ways, including freezing and storage under liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell lines can be revived and cultured indefinitely with resumed synthesis and secretion of monoclonal antibodies specific for T. vaginalis antigen. The secreted antibody is recovered from tissue culture supernatant by conventional precipitation, ion exchange, affinity chromatography, or the like. The recovered antibody can be freeze dried and stored under refrigeration for at least several weeks without significant loss of activity. The following examples are offered to illustrate a particular embodiment of the invention but they are not intended to limit it.II. EXAIFLES OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SFE .FIC FOR T. VAGINALISA. Pretaration of Antigen Strains used for preparing and assaying monoclonal antibodies include a long term grown culture, strain RU 375 and N E 286 obtained from Dr. Miklos Muller, Rockefeiler University, New York and fresh isolate JHH obtained from Michael Spence, The Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD . Trichomonas vaainalis was grown in a Diamond trypticase BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD yeast extract maltose TYM medium, pH 6.2, supplemented with 10 heat inactivated horse serum Kansas City Biologicals,Inc., Lenexa, Kansas . Organisms routinely grew to a density of 2.5 x 106 to 5 x 106 per ml as determined with an improved Neubauer counting chamber. Only motile parasites at logarithmic stage of growth were utilized. Stock cultures of all T. vaginalis strains were stored in liquid nitrogen in TYM serum medium containing 10 dimethylsulfoxide DMSO . All strains remained virulent throughout these studies as evidenced by lesion development in mice after 9 12 days post subcutaneous inoculation. antigen used for immunization a. For studies where spleen lymphocytes from animals challenged with live organisms were desired the trichomonal strains NYH 286 and RU 375 were grown to logarithmic phase representing 1 x 106 organisms per ml.The parasites were then washed twice in sterile phosphate buffered saline PBS and finally resuspended to a density of 5 x 106 per 0.5 ml volume in TYM serum with 0.05, Ó agar. A second injection was performed as indicated in the next section with organisms in TYM serum medium followed by a third injection with T. vRginalis suspended in PBS. b. Crude plasma membranes of T. vaginalis strain NYH 286 were generated from 2 x 108 cells. The organisms were washed three times in PBS followed by resuspending the organisms in PBS containing 10 mM MgC12 and 0.5 mg ml concanavalin A. The organisms agglutinated and were washed twice further with PBS 10 mM MgCl2. Pelleted trichomonads were resuspended in 10 ml of 1 M glycerol and injected into 12 ml of 10 mM tris hydrochloride buffer tris HCl , pH 7.5, containing 2 mM phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride PMSF and 1 mM MgC12. After a 10 minute incubation, the cells were homogenized further with a teflon pestle Dounce homogenizer 20 strokes and cell lysis verified by examination of the cell preparation using darkfield and phase optics on aZeiss IM30 microscope. The homogenate was then layered on a two step gradient consisting of 8 ml of 0.5M mannitol over 5 ml of 0.58M sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 250 x g for 30 minutes to form a pellet. The pellet represented crude membranes used for immunization protocols. Electrophoretic analysis of crude membrane material confirmed the presence of immunogenic proteins and glycoproteins previously identified as residing on T. vaginalis membranes Alderete, Infect. Immun. 40 284, 1983 . Protein values were determined by the Bradford technique Bradford, A nal. Eiochem. 72 248, 1976 .B. Immunization Schdule for Hybridoma Production Different immunization protocols were used depending on the antigen employed for generating immune spleen cells. Monoclonal antibodies illustrated in this embodiment are from three separate hybridization experiments, each representing the antigen described above. Spleen cells from two mice were used for each hybridization. Six to eight week old EALfj, CJ female mice Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Nine were employed for these studies. 1. Live oraanisms Nice were infected in the hind quarters by subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml containing no less than 5 x 106 organisms per site. A second booster inoculation was performed at day 25 and a final challenge was given at day 39. Spleen cell e were asceptically removed for use in hybridoma production from the immunized mice three days after the last inoculation with live organisms. This regimen allowed for the production of high titered serum antibody levels as assayed by colorimetric ELISA and radioimmunoprecipitation electrophoretic RIP techniques. 2. Crude membrane antigen Each of two mice were given intraperitoneal injections with 1 ml of a 1 1 mixture of crude membrane 2 mg protein ml and Freund s complete adjuvant. Two booster inoculums also given intraperitoneally with identical protein levels in Freund s incomplete adjuvant at days 14 and 28 after the initial injection. Spleens from each of both mice were removed for use in hybridoma production from the immunized mice three days after the last injection of antigen.C. Construction of Hybridomas Hybridomas were produced by fusing spleen cell from the immunized mice with murine SP2 0 Ag14 hybridoma cells SP2 0 hereinafter using a modification of the basic procedure of Oi and Herzenberg, Immunoglobulin ProducingHybrid Cell Lines, In Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, B.B. Mishell and S.M. Shiigi, eds., pp. 351 37,W.H. Freeman and Co., 1980, San Francisco. Suitable cell lines were obtained from Ed Hayes, Duke University and are as originally set forth by Schulman et al, Nature 276 269 270 1978 . The SF2 0 hybridoma cell line is a hybrid cell line derived from SP2 HGLK formed as a hybrid between a BALB c spleen cell and the myeloma cell lines X63 Ag8. This cell line synthesizes no immunoglobulin chains, lacks the enzyme bypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT , is resistant to 8 azaguanine, and dies in the presence of Littlefield s hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine HAT selection medium. SP2 0 cells were grown in Dulbeco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Microbiological Associates, Walkersville, MD supplemented with 15 vol vol heat inactivated fetal calf serum Microbiological Associates , 2 mM L glutamine, and 50 units ml penicillin and 50 ug ml streptomycin.SP2 0 cells were grown in this medium containing 8 azaguanine 20 ug ml immediately prior to use in hybridization experiments to ensure that no HGPRT positive revertants were present in the cell culture. Spleens were removed aseptically from immunized mice and teased apart gently with forceps to prepare a single cell suspension in DMEM 1 mM Hepes buffer Microbiological Assooates . SP2 0 cells were harvested in the logarith mc phase of growth and both cell types were collected by centrifugation at 270 x g for 10 minutes at 80C and washed three times with DMEM. Total cell numbers were determined with a Neubauer Counting hemocytometer and viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Approximately 10 spleen cells were mixed together with SP2 0 cells in a 50 ml conical tube at a ratio of 7 viable spleen cells per viable SP2 0 cell and the resultant cell suspension was collected in a pellet by centrifugation at 270 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant medium was removed and the tube containing the cell pellet was placed in a 370C water bath for 1 minute. A 1.0 ml portion of a warm 370C 50 wt vol solution of polyethylene glycol PEG 1000 ATCC in DMEM per 1 2 x 108 spleen cells was added to the cell pellet with gentle stirring over a 1 minute period. The suspension was stirred an additional minute. Then, 1 ml per 1 2 x iO8 spleer cells of DM was added over an additional 1minute period and this step repeated onee more. Finally, 7 ml per 1 2 x i08 spleen cells DMEM with 20 fetal bovine serum tested for hybridoma growth, MicrobiologicalAssociates was added over 2 3 minutes. The cells were then centrifuges at 400 x g for 10 minutes and cells resuspended to 2 4 x 106 per ml in HY medium Kennett et al, LymPhocyte Hybridomas Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Vol., 81, pp. 77 91 1978 Springerverlag, New York and dispensed in 50 ul portions containing 2 4 x 105 cells into each well of 96 well plates Costar Plastics, Vineland, New Jersey , which were then incubated at 370C in a humidified incubator containing a 7 CO atmosphere. On day one, a 50 ul portion of a two fold concentration of Littlefield s HAT selection medium was added to each well. An additional 50 ul portion of HAT was added to each well on day four. The unfused SP2 0 cells died in HAT within 24 48 hours. Cell growth in HAT medium is indicative of successful hybridization. Hybrid clones selected in HAT were usually observed by day six. After day six, all wells were fed HT glycine medium, which comprises HY medium containing 1.6 x 10 M hypoxanthine, and 3 x 10 6M glycine. Wells which contained growing clones were assayed to detect monoclonal antibodies directed at T. vaginalis surface antigens and cells where supernatants were positive for antibody toward parasites were transferred from these individual wells into a respective well of a 24 well tissue culture plate Costar Plastics .Hybrid clones were maintained in BY medium without feeder layers and sequentially expanded to grow in T75 750 mm2 flasks Costar for freezing of cell lines in 90 Fetal bovine serum Microbiological Associates 10 DMSO ATCC in liquid nitrogen. D. ChaEacterization of Monoclonal Antibody 1. Analysis of Anti T. vaginalis Membrane Antigen Activity in Hybridoma Supernatants Screening of hybrid clone culture supernatants for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed againt T.vaginalis membrane antigens was performed using an ELISA technique Alderete, Brit. J. Vener. Dis. 60 164, 1984 .Live trichomonas in logarithmic phase of growth were washed well in PBS and 50 ul representing 1.25 x 105 organisms were plated onto individual Immulon II strip wells Dynatech, Alexandria, VA . The cells were allowed to dry at 370C followed by fixation with 100 ethanol. Antiger. coated wells remained stable over a period of 6 months and were stored at 40C until use. Antigen coated wells were washed three times with pH 7.2 phosphate buffered saline PBS . PBS 300 ul containing 1 wt vol bovine serum albumin BSA was incubated in each microtiter well for 1 hour at room temperature to saturate nonspecific protein binding sites in the plastic well. This solution was then removed by aspiration, the wells were washed three times with PES, 100 ul cf hybrid clone culture supernatant was added to the well and the microliter plate was incubated at 370C for 120 minutes. Positive control wells contained mouse serum obtained from the same mouse whose spleen was employed for hybrldization. Supernatant fluid was then removed by aspiration, the microtiter wells washed three times with PBS, and alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulins Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, Pennsylvania , prepared by the method of Vow per et al, Bull. hEO 53 55 65, 1976 , and diluted i 500 in PBS, was then added to a final volume of 200 ul in each microtiter well. The microtiter plates were incubated at 370C for one hour after which the conjugated antisera was removed by aspiration, the wells washed three times with PBS, and 300 ul of enzyme substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate Sigma 1 mg ml in 10 vol vol diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 containing z mMMgC12 was added to each well.Thirty minutes later, the absorbance of the solution in each well was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using a Dynatech MicroELISA reader Dynatech, Alexandria, MD . Microtiter wells in which the absorbance was at least two fold greater than background levels of absorbance obtained with antigen free control wells were scored as positive for the presence of antibodies directed against T. vaginalis membrane antigens. Of approximately 500 hybrid clones screened, 3 hybrids demonstrated cytolytic antibody reactive againstT. vaginalis glycoprotein antigen determinants. These monoclonals are designated C20A3, 375 1, and D 155. Clone C20A3 was deposited with the American Type CultureCollection, Rockville, Md and accorded the deposit number H3 3 a 2. Isotypic Analysis Cultures positive for antibodies against T. vaginalis were next tested to identify the mouse antibody isotype, using standard immunological assays employing rabbit anti mouse subclass antibody reagents and peroxidaseconjugated affinity purified goat anti rabbit IgQ2a for use in standard ELISA Mouse immunoglobulin subtype identification kit, Boehringen Mannheim Biochemicals,Indianapolis, IN . All monoclonal antibodies were of theIgG subclass. 3. Analysis of Anti T. vaginalis Membrane Protein Activity in Hybridoma SuDernatants Culture supernatant fluids from hybrid clones which scored positive in the ELISA test were assayed by a radioimmunoprecipitation method Alderete, Infect. Immun. 39 1041, 1983 and Alderete, Infect. Immun. 40 284, 1983 for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against trichomonal membrane proteins. Membrane proteins of T. vaginalis were radioiodinated by a recently published method Alderete, Infect. Immun.40 284, 1983 . Radioiodinated cells were extensively washed with PBS and pelleted organisms resuspended with 200 ul of NET 150 mEw NaCl, EDTA, 50 mM Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.2 buffer containing 1 mM PMSF Sigma and placed in a 370C water bath for 10 minutes. Twenty five microtiters of 10 Zwitterionic 3 12 Z3 12 detergent Calbiochem Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA was then added, and the mixture was gently homogenized until the trichomonads were solubilized. An addition 20 ul of NET buffer was added, and the detergent extract was centrifuged over a 5 sucrose bed for 3C minutes at 100,000 x g with a Beckman 5i250.1 rotor. Greater than 80X of the initial radioactlvity was routinely recovered in the supernatant. Before mixing with antibody, the Z3 12 extract was preadsorbed with 100 ul of 10 vol vol Formalin fixed, protein A bearing S. aureus to remove nonspecific binding proteins. Then 100 ul of the adsorbed solubilized trichomonal proteins was mixed with 50 ul of hybridoma supernatant and incubated overnight at 40C. Finally, 100 ul of 10, volXvol fixed protein A bearing S. aureus was added, and incubation was continued at room temperature for a further 2 hours. The protein A bearing S. au eus adsorbed immune complexes were then sedimented at 10,000 x g for 4 minutes and washed three times in NET 0.5 Z3 12 buffer. Radiolabeled antigen antibody complexes were then solubilized in electrophoresis dissolving buffer.The samples were suspended and boiled for three minutes, and protein A bearing S. aureus cells were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants containing parasite protein antigens were finally loaded on SDS polyacrylamide slab gels. Electrophoresis was performed as described Alderete, Infect. Immun. 39 1041, 1983 , and gels were fixed and processed for fluorography. The protein A. bearing S. aureus cells were sequentially washed in 0.5 Z3 12 and 0.05 Z3 12 in NET buffer just before use. The formaldehyde fixed protein A bearing S. aureus organisms employed in these studies were grown and prepared as described elsewhere Alderete and Baseman, Infect. Immun.26 1048, 1979 . Equally important was immunoprecipitation of trichomonal proteins biosynthesized and radiolabeled with 135S methionine with molecular weights identical to those obtained with radioiodinated organisms. A total of three monoclonal antibodies from four hybridization experiments using different antigens were shown to be directed at a T. vaginalis glycoprotein which is highly immunogenic in mice infected with live parasites and patients with trichomoniasis. The membrane glycoprotein possesses a molecular weight of approximately 230,000 daltons 230Kd when the different monoclonals were tested against the commonly used strain NYU 286.Other molecular weights were ncted for some strains. 4. Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies with Cell Surface Exposed Proteins In addition to analysis of the surface location of the parasite antigen by a whole cell ELiSS and radicimmunoprecipitation. procedures, supernatants of hybrid cell lines were tested by indirect immunofluorescence using live strain NYH 286 as test T. vaginalis organism. All monoclonals resulted in strong fluorescence of the organisms. Thus, the epitopes for this antigen are readily exposed on the parasite surface. 5. Monoclonal Antibody Reactivity to a Protein Epitope and Not a Sugar Epitope The reaction of the antibodies to the protein com ponent of the glycoprotein molecules was established using a modification of the ELISA procedure stated earlier Aiderete, brit. . Vener. Dis. 60 164, 1984 and indirect irmunofluorescence as just described. Briefly, T.vaginalis fixed on individual wells of microtiter plates were treated with. increasing levels cf periodic acid ranging from 0.001 mM to 100 mM for 15 and 30 min at 370C. Periodate is known to break vicinyl hydroxy groups in carbchydrate structures and conditions use are known to destroy sugars o all surfaces Ofek et al., Nature London 265 623, 19 7 . Following treatment with periodate, the respectlve monoclonals are reacted with the treated and untreated control parasites, and the ELISA performed as before. In all cases the ELISA reactivity was positive indicating the epitope for antibody binding on the protein moiety. Strong fluorescence was also noted on periodate treated trichomonads. 6. Strain Distribution of the Antigen Determinant It was of interest to determine if the antigenic determinant recognized by one of the key monoclonal antibodies was unique to the immunizing T. vaginalis strain or whether this antigenic determinant might be found in all other pathogenic human trichomonal strains. Accordingly, nine different clinical isolates of T. vaginalis strainsNYH 286, NiH 272, ATCC 30001, ATCC 30236 JH31A , JHHZH,JHHR, JHHR, JHHEL, and JHHW collected over a two year period were examined for the presence of the antigenic determinant recognized by monoclonal antibodies. One ug ascites of C20A3 monoclonal were added to microtiter plate wells Voller, et al. Manual ClinicalImmunol. 1976 , and to individual wells was added 50 ul ofT. vaginalis detergent extract obtained from a 1 ml final volume. After a 60 min incubation, the wells were washed with PBS followed by sequential addition to wells of rabbit antisera to T. vaginalis strain NYH 286 and goat anti rabbit Ig alkaline phosphatase conjugated . 11 monoclonal antibodies detected all strains to the same extent as the homologous strain employed as the immunization agent, strain 286. Importantly, strains 286 and JH31A were cultivated in vitro for several years and thus represented long term grown cultures while the other strains were fresh isolates grown for no longer than 3 4 days in Applicant s laboratory prior to testing. 7. Cytolytic Activity by Monoclonal Antibodies Monoclonal antibodies were all of the IgG subclass and were purified by protein A Sepharose affinity chromatography. Immunoglobulin was eluted with IN AcOH inPBS, dialyzed against two changes of distilled water, concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against PBS. These monoclonals in physiological saline were then employed for studies mentioned below. A 0.1 ml sample of 2 x 106 organisms washed twice with PBS was mixed with an equal volume of purified monoclonal IgG or control IgG of the same subclass but unreactive with T. vaainalic i.e. antimycoplasma IgG antibody . After 20 min at 370C with gentle shaking, the parasites were washed twice with PBS and resuspended to a 1 ml final volume in PBS. Numbers were determined and a quantitative assessment of lysis determined under these conditions. Up to 85 lysis was achieved using strain NYH 286 with mcnoclonal C20A3. Lysis was also evident using the D0 155 and 375 1 monoclonals under the same conditions. The cytolytic potential of the respective monoclonals was also evaluated by demonstrating the release of 3 H thymidine labeled DSA. of live trichomonads after incubation of T. vaginalis organisms with antibody under a variety of conditions. The data obtained from these type of experiments correlated with those mentioned above involving microscopic enumeration and quantitation of killed organisms.E. L iiit The hybridoma cell lines and the monoclonal antiboles produced therefrorn described in this application are useful in the purification and characterization of specific antigenic and immunogenic components presented byTrichomonas vaginalis organisms. Moreover, the monoclonal antibodies produced from a given hybridoma line are homo generous in antigenic recognition and thereby are useful for subsequent affinity chromatography based purification of trichomonal membrane antigens. Furthermore, the availability of different monoclonal antibodies directed against one or more antigenic deter r..nants of the same outer membrane antigen of T. vaginalis is useful in studying the structure and function of membrane components. Similarly, these same monoclonal anti bodies are valuable in the idiotypic analysis of antibody response to cell surface structure of a pathogenic microorganism. Ultimately, the availability of monoclonal antibodies directed against selected T. vaginalis membrane antigens, in particular cell surface exposed membrane proteins, will facilitate studies on the vaccinogenic potential of these proteins. Monoclonal antibodies specific to and cytotoxic forT. vaainalis can be used clinically for the prevention or treatment of trichomoniasis. For example, monoclonal antibodies specific for surface antigens of T. vaginalis can be used clinically for the prevention and or treatment of trichomonal disease in animals, including human adults.The mode of administration of these monoclonal antibodies is preferably oral. The monoclonal antibodies may be suspended or dissolved in any of several suitable liquid vehicles and delivered to the host by one or several oral means. The ascites fluid of the animal or the in vitro culture medium in which the antibody producing clones were propagated are pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carriers for animals and may be used directly without purification or concentration though a clarification step may be desirable. In some instances and particularly where human treatment is involved, purification may be desired or required pursuant to governmental regulation. In humans, the monoclonal antibody compositions are preferably administered in capsular form, though any compatible carrier may be used. The T. vaginalis specific monoclonal antibodies are also useful for medical and research purposes. For instance, these monoclonal antibodies can be used diagnos tically to detect with great accuracy the presence of T. vaainalis strains among a general population of bacteria. The foregoing description of the invention has been directed to particular embodiments for purposes of explanation and illustration, It will be apparent, however, to those skilled in the art that many modifications and changes in the processes of preparing and implementing the described embodiments may be made without departing from the essence of the invention. For example, it is contempiated that hybridoma cell lines may be developed fusing human myeloma cells and human lymphocytes primed to membrane antigens of T. vaginalis. In another example, monoclonal antibodies can be developed which are specific for individual T. vaginalis strains other than strain 286 used in these hybridization experiment. Also, hybridoma cells can be constructed from the differentiated lymphoid cells of mice immunized by alternate routes and methods. Similarly, other mouse strains can be used to produce hybridoma cells eiaborating similar sets of monoclonal antibodies suitable to the purposes described herein. These and other modifications and uses of the depicted embodiment, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It is pplicant s intention in the following claims to cover all equivalent modifications and variations as fall within the scope of the invention.
