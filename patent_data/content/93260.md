# Method and apparatus for dynamic range control.

## Abstract
In apparatus for investigating earth formations traversed by a borehole, improved methods and apparatus are pro vided for achieving dynamic range control of formation measurements. In one embodiment adapted to formation resistivity measurements, a well logging tool moving through a borehole emits a current into the adjacent earth formation, and a corresponding measurement voltage corre lative to the resistivity is sampled at discrete elevations as the tool traverses the borehole. An average of these voltage measurements is formed. When the magnitude of this average exceeds or drops below a predetermined range, the magnitude of the survey voltage is decreased or increased respectively by a discrete amount.
