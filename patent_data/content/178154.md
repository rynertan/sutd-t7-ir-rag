## Description
REFRACTORY MATERIALS, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE This invention concerns refractory compositions useful in mortars, coatings and castings, gunning or ramming mixtures. The following patents and literature references represent some aspects of the general field ofMgAl204 spinels used in mortars, castables and coatings and the like employing phosphorous acids as a reactive component. U.S. Patent 3,730,744 discloses aggregate cast shapes employing Al 112PO4 3 as the bonding solution which contains alkalizing ions as the curing agents.U.S. Patent No. 3,285,755 teaches ammonium phosphate in combination with aluminum phosphate plus MgO from calcined dolomite where spinel is mentioned as an aggregate. U.S. Patent 4,459,156 discloses a spinel composition. A fundamental review of phosphate bonding is found in J. AMER. CERAMIC SOCIETY, Vol. 133, No. 8,August 1, 1950 by William David Kingery. Another review is found in Ceramic Bulletin, Vol. 56, No. 7, page 640 by J.E. Cassidy 1977 . Other studies are as follows Ceramic Bulletin, Vol 59, No. 7 1980 byFrancisco J. Gonzales and John W. Halloran, Reaction of Orthophosphoric Acid with Several Forms of Aluminum Oxide and an abstract of a Russian Scientific paper authored by L. B. Khoroshavin, V. A. Ryabin, I. E.Sipeiko, V. N. Naumov, G. A. Sychev, V. Ya. Pavlov, V.M. Chyrin, N. F. Serenko, B. V. Ponomarev, and E. P.Kosolapova, Eastern Institute of Refractories, UralScientific Research Institute Qf Chemistry, PermChemical Plant, All Union Scientific Research Institute for the Power Supply in Nonferrous Metallurgy, frpm Ogneupory, No. 3, pp. 34 36, March, 1977 translated . The two review articles, the one by Kingery covering the art to 1949 and the other by Cassidy from 1949 1977 form a very complete picture of the state of technology on phosphate bonding. Materials listed as forming phosphate bonds with phosphoric acid are TiO2, CaO, FeO, Fe2O3, NiO, ZnO, ZrO2, MgO, A1203, and Cr2O3. These may be reacted as pure compounds or as constituents in mineral compositions, i.e., asbestos, bauxite or clay. The most common bonding mechanism using phosphoric acid is the reaction with alumina to form A1 112PO4 3 which is also the starting material in many formulations in place of H3PO. Al H2PO4 3 further reacts with either alumina, clay or bauxite, resulting in orthophosphates MgHPO4.3H20 or AlH3 PO4 a as the bond. In the H3PO4 A1203 system addition of M 2, Foe 3 or Be 2 ions increase bonding strength but these ions also contribute to premature setting. The patent literature very closely follows the above literature review that is, while it teaches phosphate bonded systems, it only mentions spinel as one possible aggregate material. Also these aggregates are not reactive with any activity due to free MgO and are typically part of the coarse portion with very few fines material C 325 mesh . In accordance with the present invention, effective compositions can be produced to bind, as a mortar, both porous and non porous materials such as refractory brick, as a protective coating for such ceramic and non ceramic shapes, and fiber products, as well as producing castings such as brick, covers, nozzles, including fiber ceramic or metal reinforced castings. The ingredients for producing the various compositions are 1 at least one reactive MgA1204 spinel, 2 optionally, non reactive fillers, 3 an inorganic acidic phosphate material 4 water, and 5 optionally, handling agents. The compositions of the present invention having non hydroxide reactive components and fillers in combination with an acidic phosphate source, such as phosphoric acid and or aluminum dihydrogen phosphate are unique in that a stronger mortar with longer consistent shelf lives up to 60 plus days can be prepared. In addition the formulations contain less water tahn similar formulations employing hydroxide containing components. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a mortar, coating or castable composition which is usable in, particularly, the metals industry for construction and repair of refractory linings and coating of component parts for example, in melting furnaces, electrolytic metal winning cells, component parts for metal casting machines, including gates, transfer pipes and troughs, nozzles and the like, as well as refractory linings and linings and coatings in the steel, chemical and petrochemical industries. The present invention provides refractory compositions, particularly mortar, coating or castable refractory compositions comprising 1 5 to 85 per cent by weight of a reactive MgA1204 spinel, heated to above about 700 C and at least about 6 per cent of which has been calcined and sintered to at least about 1600 C 2 preferably, 0 to 80 per cent by weight of a substantially non reactive filler 3 1 to 20 per cent by weight of an inorganic acidic phosphate material capable of decomposing on heating to a material containing PO3 units 4 4 to 20 per cent by weight of water and 5 preferably, 0 to 5 per cent by weight of handling agents. The MgA1204 spinel of component 1 is usually prepared by the process described in U.S. Patent 4,400,431. The spinel component 1 may be a mixture of which from 5 to 85 per cent by weight has been calcined to a temperature of from 1600 to 1650XC, or may be a mixture comprising from 0 to 25 per cent by weight of a spinel calcined to from 700 to 800 C, and from 0 to 50 per cent of a spinel calcined to from 700 to 1600 C, preferably from 800 to 1600it. The non reactive filler of component 2 is usually highly sintered such as tabular alumina, fused grain alumina, fused grain spinel, MgAl204 heated to above 16500C, as well as other fused grain materials such as ZrSiO4, SiC and steel fibers. The inorganic acidic phosphate material component 3 , is frequently a phosphorous compound such as Al H2PO4 3 or H3PO4 or a mixture thereof. The material must be capable of decomposing to form PO3 units on heating, such as during the drying out of the formulation, usually at above about 200 C. Water coçxnent 4 is employed as necessary to give workability to the binder composition, as are preferably handling agents component 5 . Total water content usually employed is from about 4 to about 20 weight percent of the total composition. Suitable handling agents, including set modifiers, component 5 include activated alumina, fumed alumina A1203 , glycerine, polyvinyl alcohol, MgO, Mg O 2 or mixtures of two or more, employed in from 0 to about 5 weight percent of the total composition.Other well known handling agents may also be employed. Depending upon the ultimate use of the composition, various fillers, fibers ceramic and or metal , aggregates and the like may be added to give compression strengths, reduce density and or improve bond strength, and insulating properties as obtained by incorporating these materials in conventional mortars, coatings, castables and the like. Formulations containing the aforedescribed components are hereafter set forth in tabular form to illustrate the variety of mixtures of those components within the scope of the present invention which produce excellent mortars, coatings and the like for ceramic bodies which are to be put into severe corrosive and or high temperature service. It is to be understood that the compositions of this invention, in addition to being mortars and coatings, may also be used in preparing castables, ramming mixtures, gunning mixtures, and the like or used as the binder system in pressed, extruded, or cast refractory shapes.

The entries appearing in the second column set forth the kind of filler with the percentage appearing below. In the following examples, unless otherwise denoted, the reactive MgAl204 spinel is derived from a coprecipitation process in which a mixture of magnesium aluminum hydroxides MgxAly OH z and aluminum hydroxides and or aluminum oxyhydroxides are produced then calcined and or sintered to obtain the species employed in this invention. The magnesium aluminum hydroxide phase represented above may contain other anions partially substituting for hydroxide e.g. C1 , NO3 SO, , CO3 , the presence and amount of which will be determined by the type of reactant salts used in the coprecipitation and the type and duration of subsequent treatments, chemical or thermal, to which the precipitate phase has been subjected.The precipitate of magnesium aluminum and aluminum hydroxy compounds is referred to as spinel precursor. The overall Al Mg ratio with this mixture will be very nearly 2.0, unless otherwise noted. If this ratio significantly deviates from 2.0 e.g. 1.90 or 2.10 segregated MgO and orA1203 phases are normally observed in the calcined or sintered product and these can affect reactivity. The A1 H2PO4 3, H3PO41 fused grain A1203, fumed alumina, and tabular alumina are all commercially available, substantially pure compounds and or solutions. The sintered spinels may be commercially available fused grain material or a highly sintered, above 1650 C spinel prepared in acordance with U.S. Patent 4,400,431. Formulations may consist of two main parts.The binder phase is produced by reacting an acidic phosphate species with at least one reactive oxide species. This can be carried out prior to the addition of the aggregate or filler material which latter component s may be inert, as in the case of fused grain or tabular A12o3, or highly sintered 16500C Meal204, or may have some degree of reactivity, as in the case of NgAl2O4 sintered to 516500C or calcined A1203. This reactivity is due to changes in surface area, degree of crystalline perfection.and or population of surface hydroxyls available for reaction. The preferred manner of preparing formulations of the present invention is to combine the reactive spinel, the inert fillers if used, and any other solid components as a dry mix then adding the dry mix to the liquid component s . Although reverse mixing may be employed it is easier and requires less energy intensive mixing to add the dry mix to the liquid.EXAMPLE 1 A magnesium aluminum spinel powder MgAl204 was prepared in pilot plant quantities in the manner ofExample 4 of U.S. Patent 4,400,431. A portion of the sample was sintered at about 16500C then ground to pass through a U.S. Standard 200 mesh sieve and another portion calcined at about 12000C and likewise ground to pass through a U.S. Standard 200 mesh sieve. One hundred grams of the 16500C and 26 grams of the 12000C materials described above were intimately mixed with 86 grams of 100 mesh U.S. Standard tabular alumina as a filler. The dry mixture was combined with 32.5 grams of 85 percent H3PO4 and 35.0 grams of water.The resulting mixture contained 14 percent water including the 4.88 grams in the 85 percent H3PO4 and produced a mortar having a compressive strength of 7600 psi 52364 kPa and a flexural modulus of 950 psi 6545 kPa when bonded to a DV 38 high alumina brick A. P. GreenRefractories .EXAMPLE 2 A mixture of 60.5 grams of magnesium aluminum spinel sintered at 16500C and ground to pass a U.S.Standard 200 mesh sieve and 41.3 grams of tabular alumina, sized to pass a 100 mesh sieve is added to a solution of 7.9 grams of A1 H2PO4 3 and 2.72 grams ofH3PO4 in total 8.38 grams H2O. A casting of this mortar has a compressive strength in excess of 10,000 psi 68900 kPa . This example demonstrates a mortar with reduced water content.EXAMPLE 3 126 grams of MgAl204 sintered to 16500C and 86 grams of tabular alumina, were mixed and added to a solution of 25.4 grams of A1 H2PO4 3 and 3.4 grams ofH3PO4 in 32.2 grams of H2O. This mortar formulation gives a bond strength of 2900 psi it9981 kPa to high alumina brick and has shown excellent performance in molten salt electrochemical cells when used with both a A12O3 and t3 NaA111O17 bricks. The use of tabular sintered alumina in place of fused grain alumina offers several advantages.The first of these is strength, with tabular containing formulations consistently out performing fused grain formulations. Second is better handling characteristics, which reduces the need for handling modifiers. Last is price, with tabular alumina costing less than fused grain alumina. Mortars made in accordance with Example 3 were made up in 60 to 100 lb. 222 to 370 kg batches and used as the mortar in laying up brick in magnesium reduction cells. In service tests for 8 months compared to brick layed up with conventional cell mortar alumina phosphate bond or alumina silicate bond showed the mortar of the present invention to be superior to the conventional mortar. Mortars of similar constitution have been used to coat the refractory used in covers for magnesium reduction cells and put into service with good results.Example 4 375 g. of MgAl204 sintered at 16500C and ground to pass through a U.S. standard 200 mesh sieve is mixed with 291 g. of fused grain MgAl204, sized to pass a 20 mesh sieve but not a 100 mesh sieve, and 231 grams of tabular alumina, sized to pass a 48 mesh sieve. This mixture is added to a solution of 79.5 grams A1 H2PO4 3 and 9.35 grams of H3PO4 in 99.1 grams B2O to produce a castable material with good handling characteristics. After firing at 5000C this refractory has a flexural strength of 1600 psi 11024 kPa . This example demonstrates the improvement in strength obtained with the use of metal fiber reinforcement. If 30 grams of rolled and sheared stainless steel fibers roughly l x0.02 x0.006 2.54 cm x 0.05 cm x 0.02 cm are added, the flexural strength increases 25 percent to 2000 psi 13780 kPa . Example 5 9.4 kg of MgAl204 sintered to 1650 C and ground to pass through a U.S. standard 40 mesh seive with at least 90 percent also passing a 100 mesh sieve and a substantial portion also passing a 325 mesh sieve was slurried in a solution consisting of 2.524 kg of Al H2PO4 3 in 2.846 kg of H2O. To this slurry were added 9.8 kg of commercially available 6 mesh SiC and 19.6 kg of SiC which passed an 8 mesh seive. The latter was produced by ball milling and sizing the 6 mesh material. This material, which has a bulk density of S 155 lb ft 248 kg m3 and a compressive strength of 9000 psi 62010 kPa after firing at 1000 C, was used to cast a 12 inch 30.3 cm diameter 18 inch 45.7 cm high crucible which was used successfully for 3 months in a commercial induction furnace for melting non ferrous metals, delivering 38 heating cycles, compared to 2 for the crucible supplied by the furnace manufacturer. Example 6 220 grams of MgAl2O4 sintered to 1650 C and ground to pass a U.S. standard 100 mesh sieve were added to a solution of 132.5 grams of A1 H2PO4 3 in 132.5 grams H20. This was followed sequentially by additions of 220 grams of SiC sized to pass a 100 mesh sieve, 845.9 grams of SiC sized to pass Åa 12 mesh sieve, 243.1 grams of commercial 8 mesh SiC, and 561 grams of commercial 6 mesh SiC. This castable, with a fired bulk density of 138 1b ft 220.8 kg m and a flexural strength of 1500 psi 10335 kPa , offers improved heat conduction as compared to the formulation in Example 5. Example 7 Zircon zirconium silicate, ZrSiO4 is a widely used refractory in the glass making industry.By using magnesium aluminum spinel MgAl2O4 as the basis of a phosphate bonded matrix, very strong zircon refractory products can be produced. In this example 7 0 grams of MgAl204 calcined to 8000C and ground to pass a U.S. standard 100 mesh sieve is slurried in a solution of 12.6 grams A1 H2PO4 3 in 19.2 grams H2O. To this slurry are added 20 grams of MgAl2O4 sintered to 1600 C and ground to pass a 100 mesh sieve, 13 grams MgAl2O4 sintered to above 16000C and sized to pass a 100 mesh sieve but to be retained on a 200 mesh seive, and 50 grams of ZrSiO4 sized to pass a 325 mesh seive. The mortar produced has good handling properties, and after firing to 10000C, a compressive strength of 7200 psi 49608 kPa and an adhesion to high alumina brick of 960 psi 6614 kPa .
