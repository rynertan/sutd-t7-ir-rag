# Molded foam backed carpet assembly and method of producing same.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a moulded carpet assembly 10 suitable for use in an automobile having foam backing only in localized preselected areas of the carpet assembly 10 to reduce weight, provide better fit and conformity while providing the desired padding, cushioning and sound deadening where most needed. The carpet assembly has a predetermined nonplanar three dimensional contoured configuration for conforming to the predetermined contours of the floor of said automobile a mouldable thermoplastic polymer layer 24 covering the carpet backing 22 and imparting mouldability to the carpet 10 for maintaining said configuration and at least one foam paid 15a,b,c carried by said thermoplastic polymer layer 24 and bonded thereto, said pad 15a,b,c extending over less than the entire surface of said thermoplastic polymer layer 24 and providing desired cushioning and sound and thermal insulation only in preselected areas of the carpet 10. The invention also provides a method of producing a carpet assembly for use in an automobile which comprises applying a layer 24 of a mouldable thermoplastic polymer to the carpet backing 22 of a carpet 10, heating the carpet 10 to soften the thermoplastic layer 24 and moulding the carpet 10 into a predetermined nonplanar three dimensional contoured configuration and forming in situ on the exposed surface of the thermoplastic layer 24 at least one foam pad 15a,b,c bonded to the thermoplastic layer 24 and covering seclected areas only of the carpet 10.
