# Improvements in or relating to lamps.

## Abstract
A lamp consists of a high voltage power supply 5 mounted on an evacuated envelope 1. The lamp glows when electrons from a cathode 2 strike a phospher coating 4 on the inside surface of the envelope. The lamp is mounted so that it can be separated from the power supply and provision is made to inhibit the generation of the very high anode den tial by the power supply unless it is correctly mounted on the envelope.
