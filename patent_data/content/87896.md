# Liquid metal ion sources.

## Abstract
A source for the provision of ions or charged droplets of a metal, consisting of a needle 1 having an emitting tip 4 , a reservoir 3 for a metal, ions or charged droplets of which are to be emitted by the source, and a sheath 2 surrounding the needle 1 and from which the needle 1 projects, the sheath 2 serving to convey liquid metal to the emitting tip 4 of the needle 1 at a controlled rate, wherein there is provided means 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 for withdrawing the emitting tip 4 of the needle 1 into the sheath 2 so as to enable the emitting tip 4 of the needle 1 to be immersed in the liquid metal.
