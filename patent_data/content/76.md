A detergent tablet containing a builder salt has an alkalinity of at least equivalent to 3 g. of sodium hydroxide per 100 g. of the tablet composition and a density of at least 1.4 g. cc. The builder salt can be a mixture of a silicate salt and a phosphate salt, preferably with more silicate, for example sodium metasilicate, than phosphate, for example sodium tripolyphosphate. The tablets are preferably free of surfactant materials and are especially adapted for use in automatic dishwashing machines.
