# Position transducer.

## Abstract
The position transducer employs a stepping motor as a rotary position sensor by applying a bias current via resistor 37 to one pair 35, 36 of its windings and sensing the signals produced by another pair of windings 38, 39 . The bias cur rent flowing through said one pair of windings 35, 36 pro duces a magnetic detent which defines the increments of rotation. The phase relationship of the signals produced by the other two windings 38, 39 indicates direction of rotation. A detector circuit 40 to 60 connected to the other two wind ings 38, 39 produces an output signal indicative of the direc tion of rotation each time the shaft of the stepping motor is rotated one increment.
