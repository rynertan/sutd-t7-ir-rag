## Description
DESCRIPTION THE PREPARATION OF CYCLIC KETONES BY CATALYTIC OXIDATION OF CYCLIC TERPENES The present invention relates to the manufacture of mono and or diketonic derivatives of mono or sesqui terpenic olefines by catalytic oxidation. Of the many substrates which have been oxidised in the presence of transition metal complexes, one of the most extensively studied groups of organic compounds has been oleo in hydrocarbons. Surprisingly, no attempt has so far been made to invent similar methods for selective oxidation of terpenic olefines to oxygencontaining products. The present invention provides a method for selective oxidation of terpenic olefines to oxygencontaining products. The present invention also opens up the possibility of further functionalisation of the parent olefines. The oxidized products can in most cases be converted into valuable chemicals. Thus, 2,6,6trimethyl bicyclo 3,1,1 hept 2 en 4 one can be converted into thymol by a simple catalytic dehydrogenation. The method of the present invention consists in oxidizing with oxygen or an oxygen containing gas such as air , mono or sesqui terpenic olefines using, as catalyst, a co ordination or organometallic complex ofV, Cr, Mn, Fe, Rh, Co, Cu, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Cu. The olefines must satisfy one important condition, namely one or both of the allylic positions should be unsubstituted. Obviously, for a diketonic derivative, both such positions must be unsubstituted whereas for a monoketonic derivative at least one allylic position should be unsubstituted. Accordingly, the invention provides a process for the preparation of cyclic, monb and or diketones which comprises reacting a cyclic mono or sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbon containing at least one unsubstituted methylene group adjacent to a double bond with oxygen or an oxygen containing gas in the presence of, as catalyst, a carboxylate salt or co ordination or organometallic complex of a transition metal.The following diagram illustrates some of these conversions EMI2.1 tb SEP SEP M t SEP 1 tb SEP 0 tb SEP SEP oana or tb ss SEP Catalyst SEP ss SEP and or SEP X tb SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP 2 SEP 3 tb SEP SEP 4 tb SEP Catalyst tb SEP and or tb SEP O tb SEP 5 tb SEP 0S tb Although some conversions into a mixture of mono and diketonic derivatives can be effected by complexes of all the metals listed above, for high conversions and selectivities, the preferred metals areMn II or Mn III , Co II or Co III , Cu I or Cu II and Fe II or Fe III . The reactions presumably proceed through the well known Haber Weiss mechanism of radical auto oxidation. It is known that under the conditions used for similar oxidations of olefines the original ligand environment of the metal ion does not remain unchanged.The effectiveness of the catalyst partly depends on its solubility and, therefore, any soluble compound of the preferred metals should be able to initiate and propagate the radical auto oxidation in varying degree. Apart from the carboxylates such as stearates, oleates, acelates and benzoates of Co II or III , Mn II or III and Cu I or II which have been widely used for the other oleo in oxidation reactions, the catalysts can be any one or more of the compounds represented by the formulae A, B,C and D as depicted below M L, X 0 q where L2 2,2 bipyridyl or Formula A substituted 2,2 bipyridyl or substituted or unsubstituted 1,10 orthophenanthrcline and a M Cu, m 2, n 2, X 1, Br or C1 and p 2, q 0 or b M Cu, m 1, n 1, X NO2, p 2, q 0 or c M Mo, m 1, n 1, X Br, p 2, q 2 M O m RlCO CH COR2 n Formula B where, a M V, m 1, n 2, R1 and R2 which may be the same or different, represent CH3, C2H5, n C3H7, CF3, C6H5, C6H5CH2 or b M Mo, m 2, n 2, R1 and R2 as shown in a or c M Co, m O, n 2, R1 and R2 as shown in a or d M Co, m O, n 3, R1 and R2 as shown in a or e M Mn, m O, n 2 as shown in a or f M F Cu, m O, n 2 as shown in a or g M Rh, m O, n 3 as shown in a M Fe, m O, n 3 as shown in a MLnXp Formula C where, a M Rh, L PPh3, n 3, X C1, p 1 or b M Rh, L PPh3, n 3, X C1, p 2EMI4.1 Formula D where ,M Co, x 2 or 3, R1 and Rv which may be the same or different and represent CH3, C2H5, C3H7, CF3, Ph, PhCH2. The oxidation reaction can be effected at a temperature from OOC to about 2500C and preferably at ambient room temperature up to about 1000C. Both air or pure oxygen can be used as the oxidising agent.The pressures employed are in the range of atmospheric to 1000 psi 70 kg. cm2 . Optimisation of temperature and pressure is required depending on the substrate involved, and the desired ratio of the mono to diketonic derivatives. The residence time of the reaction can be followed by taking periodic gas chromatographic samples of the product mixture. The products are first isolated by chromatographic techniques and structures established by the usual spectroscopic methods. These are then used for rapid gas chromatographic analysis. The reaction time varies with the desired ratio of mono to diketonic derivatives, the pressure employed, the temperatures used and the like considerations. In the practice of these processes undiluted terpenic olefines are preferably used but they can also be diluted with solvents. The solvents employable include by way of example carbon tetrachloride, benzene, n octane, decalin and ethyl acetate. The following Examples are given by way of illustration of the invention. Example 1 a Pinene 15 parts was contacted with 2,2 bipyridyl cuprous iodide dimer 0.5 part at 50 C under air at a pressure of 100 psi 7 kg. cm2 for 600 minutes.The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred. The products were analysed by gas liquid chromatography showing 40 conversion of a pinene to the corresponding mono ketone derivative 1 in the diagram. Example 2 3 Carene 20 parts was contacted with bis pentane 2,4 dionato cobalt II 0.2 part under 50 psi 3.5 kg. cm2 of oxygen for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred. The products were analysed by gas liquid chromatography showing 75 conversion of A3 carene. The converted material consisted of the 5 ketocarene 60 , 2,5 diketo carene 10 and other products 5 . Example 3 A3 carene 20 parts was contacted with cobalt II stearate 0.5 part under 250 psi 17.5 kg. cm2 of oxygen at 800C for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred. The products were analysed by gasliquid chromatography showing 95 conversion of 3 carene. The converted material consisted of the 5 ketocarene 30 , 2,5 diketo carene 50J, and other products 15 . Example 4 Bicyclogeracrene 25 parts was contacted with manganese II acetate 1 part at 1200C under an oxygen pressure of 400 psi 28 kg. cm2 . The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for 12 hours. The products were analysed by gas liquid chromatography showing 60 conversion of which the diketone and the monoketone 5 and 4 in the diagram were 50 and 5 .
