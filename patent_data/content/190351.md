# ELECTROSHOCK TYPE INSECT PROOF DEVICE.

## Abstract
Electroshock type insect proof device consisting of a chamber 2 having an opening 3 , at least a pair of electrodes 5a , 5b , to which a voltage is applied, arranged in parallel with each other via an insulating gap W on a wall surface 1a around the opening 3 , and a stopper member provided between the chamber 2 and electrode 5b so as to project beyond the surface of the electrode 5b . This device is adapted to give an electroshock to a cockroach entering the chamber 2 , and thereby reliably prevent the entry of the cockroach into the chamber 2 .
