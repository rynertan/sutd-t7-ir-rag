# Communication set and method.

## Abstract
A telephone communication method provides simul taneously duplex channels between respective pairs of stations over a single wire pair highway by frequency division multiplexing. Each duplex channel has a pre determined pair of carrier frequencies, but only carrier frequency pairs of channels in use for communication are present on the highway at any time. On initiating a call, a station seeks for a free channel and reserves it by generating the go carrier of the free channel modulated with the call sign of the desired station, and also generat ing an alert signal. Quiescent stations respond to the alert by seeking a go carrier with call sign data and, on identifying their own call sign, generating the correspond ing return carrier to set up the channel.
