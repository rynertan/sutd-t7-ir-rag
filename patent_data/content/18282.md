# Liquid filter.

## Abstract
A liquid filter 10 is provided with a filter cartridge 40 which includes a semi rigid plastic blister 46 having an open end 58 closed by a cover 38 member to define a fluid receiving compartment 64 . A pleated paper filter medium 62 in the compartment 64 divides the latter into inlet 66 and outlet 68 portions which communicate with openings 82, 84, 86 in the cover member 38 . The filter includes a base 12 and a cup shaped glass housing 20 that cooperates with the base to define a chamber 22 which receives the plastic blister when the refill cartridge is installed in the filter. The cover member defines cooperating surfaces 36 which engage the base and the glass housing so that the glass housing clamps the cover member between the glass housing and the filter base. The plastic blister is shaped to conform to the inner walls of the housing so that the housing engages the walls of the blister throughout their entire area to support the blister.
