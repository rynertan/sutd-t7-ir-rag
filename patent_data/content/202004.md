## Description
POURING TUBES This invention relates to pouring tubes for use in the casting of molten metal and to a method for the production of pouring tubes. The invention is particularly suited to the continuous casting of metals particularly in respect of pouring tubes for use between a ladle and a tundish. In continuous casting, molten metal e.g. steel is passed from a ladle into a tundish which serves to maintain a constant head of molten metal. The metal flows out from the base of the ladle into the tundish through a nozzle such as for example, a slide gate nozzle and from the tundish into one or more continuous casting moulds via one or more nozzles located in the base of the tundish. The quality of the cast metal, withdrawn from the base of the mould as a strand for subsequent use as billets, blooms or slabs, can be adversely affected by oxide and other non metallic inclusions which may be entrained if the molten metal stream is not protected adequately as it flows between the ladle and the mould or moulds. A number of proposals have been suggested in which the stream of molten metal flowing from the base of a ladle is surrounded by a ladle stream protection tube i.e. a pouring tube. Use of the tube minimises the deleterious oxidation effects of atmospheric oxygen on the molten metal. Moreover, inert gas e.g. argon can be passed through the tube and around the molten metal stream thereby enhancing the minimisation of access by atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen to the stream. It is known that pouring tubes may comprise a tubular structure formed of a preformed tubular refractory, heat insulating material encased by an outer casing of thin sheet metal e.g. steel. In the past the pre formed, tubular, refractory, heat insulating portion has required complex slurryhandling methods to be utilised together with their associated time consuming, high energy consume tion drying processes. We have now found that these forming difficulties and disadvantages may be minimised by means of a self setting, foamed refractory composition. According to the present invention there is provided a pouring tube comprising an outer metal casing having an inner lining formed of a selfsetting, foamed, refractory composition comprising a particulate refractory material, surfactant and a binder system comprising a as binder, aqueous alkali metal silicate or an alkali stabilised aqueous solution of a phenol formaldehyde resol resin and b as setting agent for the binder, an ester in liquid form, The refractory compositions used to form the inner lining of pouring tubes of the invention are particularly suitable for application, into the cavity defined between the outer metal casing and a removable former or mandrel, by means of a pump.After setting and drying the refractory cornposition provides a pouring tube having a highly erosion resistant lining capable of withsting the erosive effects of molten metal and any accom panying slag passing through the tube. The lining is also heat insulaffng in contrast to a typical ceramic pouring tube. The binder system enables advantageous setting times to be obtained. Preferably, adequate lining strength is achieved within 40 to 80 minutes in the 12 to 300C temperature range thus abling the mandrel to be removed. The bench life of the self setting composition may be from 4 to 15 minutes but typically is about 10 minutes. The particulate refractory material is preferably calcined magnesite which may be deed burnt magnesite , andlor one or more of calcined dolo mite, olivine, zircon, alumina, calcined baddie, sili ca, chromite, corundum, or other neutral oxides or silicates. The total amount of particulate refractory material present in the composition may be from 70 to 95 by weight preferably 80 to 85 by weight. The surfactant may be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or norrlonic. Preferred suriactants are the anionic ones e.g. long chain alkyl sulphates or alkyl ether sulphates. The quantity of surfactant used in the refractory compositions of the invention will vary with its character but generally will be from about 0.01 to 1.0 by weight surfactant solids. The aqueous alkali metal silicate of the rdrac tory composition according to the invention is preferably an aqueous sodium silicate having a solids content of 40 to 60 by weight and a Solo2 nay0 ratio of from 2 to 3 1. The alkali stabilised aqueous solution of phenol formaldehyde resol resin is pref erably one which has been prepared by reacting together a monohydric phenol such as phenol or a cresol, or a dihydric phenol such as resohnol or mixtures thereof, and formaldehyde under alkaitne conditions. The molar ratio of phenol to formaldehyde will usually be from 1 1 to 1 3.The alkaline conditions are preferably established by adding sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to an aqueous solution of the resin. The amount of alkali metal silicate employed is preferably from 1 to 5 by weight of silicate solids and the amount of resin employed is preferably 0.9 to 3 by weight of resin solids. The hardening or setting reaction of the alkali metal silicate or phenol formaldehyde resol resin is effected by means of an ester in liquid form. The selection of the ester or esters provides a means of effecting a wide range of control over the setting reaction. Preferably the setting time is from 40 to 120 minutes. The ester or mixture of esters may be, for example, selected from glycerol diacetate diacetin glycerol triacetate triacetin , ethylene glycol diacetate, butylene glycol diacetate, propylene carbonate, y butyrolactone, caprolactone or any other cyclic ester. The amount of ester employed is preferably from 20 to 40 by weight of the quantity of phenol formaldehyde resol resin used, more preferably about 30 , or, in the case of alkali metal silicate, the amount of ester is preferably from 8 to 20 by weight, more preferably about 12 . The ester or mixed esters used to set an alkali metal silicate may be selected from for example diacetin, triacetin or ethylene glycol diacetate. Additionally a proportion of a sinter aid may be included in the refractory composition. This additive is of particular utility when a phenol formaldehyde resol resin is used, as this binder is lower in residual alkali oxides than an alkali metal silicate and therefore may not itself provide a significant proportion of sinter aid. As sinter aid one or more of sodium borate, calcium tetraborate or powdered glass may be present in amounts upto 2 by weight of the refractory composition another sinter aid is ball clay which maybe present upto 6 by weight. Within these concentrations, the sinter aid enhances the integrity of the refractory composition. The refractory compositons used to form the inner lining of pouring tubes according to the invention may also include upto 10 by weight of a particulate carbonaceous material e.g. graphite. It has been found that such carbonaceous material improves the erosion resistance of the composition.Also the erosion resistance maybe enhanced, by the inclusion of for example, by silicon carbide, silicon nitride or boron nitride. The inner lining of the pouring tubes of the invention maybe effected by any means suitable for handling foamed compositions. However, a particularly preferred method of lining the outer casing of the pouring tube is to pump, the self setting, foamed refractory composition e.g. by means of a worm pump into a gap defined between a removable former or mandrel. The gap defined between the former and the casing should preferably be in the 15 to 40 mm range and typically about 25 mm. The self setting foamed, refractory composition used to form the inner lining of pouring tubes according to the invention may be formed by mixing the constituents thereof together in any order, although, generally it is preferred that the particulate refractory material should be first mixed with the sufactant followed by the ester or esters and lastly the aqueous alkali metal silicate or alkalistabilised aqueous solution of phenol formaldehyde resol resin. It is generally preferred that the refractory composition should contain from about 10 to 20 of water. The foamed composition once formed may be applied by being pumped into the gap defined by the former and the outer metal casing and allowed to harden or set. In most applications 30 to 180 minutes will ba satisfactory although 40 to 120 minutes will be generally preferred. After setting the former is withdrawn and residual water is removed. This removal may be hastened by drying at temperatures of upto 20000. On examination after drying a foamed structure remains affording enhanced insulation properties. The density of the pouring tube lining after drying maybe in the range of 1 2 g.cm 3. Optimum properties are generally obtained when the density of the lining is in the range 1.3 1.8 g.cm 3. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of forming a pouring tube which comprises inserting a former or mandrel into a tubular sheet metal casing so as to define a gap therebetween corresponding in thickness to that of the lining to be formed and introducing into the gap a composition as hereinbefore defined until the gap between the former or mandrel and the casing is filled, allowing the composition to set, removing the former or mandrel and heating the lining to remove substantially all the water retained by the lining after setting. According to a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of casting in which molten metal is transferred from an outlet in a metallurgical ladle to a metallurgical tundish via a pouring tube as hereinbefore defined said pouring tube being attached to the exit nozzle of the ladle. The invention is more particularly described with reference to the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1 Ingredient Dead burnt magnesite 84.4 Supplied by Radex GmbH, designated as Grade HBGNormal 0.8 solids solution of 10.2 sodium alkyl sulphate Average m.w. 260 Glycerol triacetate 1.0Alkali stabilised aqueous 3.4 solution of phenolformaldehyde resol resin solids content 60 Sodium tetraborate 1.0 Total water content 11.5 The magnesite, sodium tetraborate and surfactants were added together in a planetary mixer and mixed for 2 minutes resulting in a foamed mixture, the glycerol triacetate was added to the foamed mixture and mixed for 1 minute followed lastly by the resin which was also mixed for 1 minute. The intial density of the foamed mixture after setting was 1.46 g.cm 3. After subsequent drying the density was 1.35 g.cm 3. Prior to drying the foamed mixture was pumped using a worm pump manufactured by Putzmeister to provide a 25 mm thick inner tubular lining in a steel tube of 1100 m length and I mm wall thickness using a suitable tubular former. The ambient temperature was 2000. The bench life of the composition was 10 minutes. The former was removed after 60 minutes and the tube thus formed was dried at 18000 for 4 hours. The pouring tube was evaluated by immersing the lower 100 mm portion in a bath of molten steel held in an induction furnace at a temperature of 164000. Although, the outer steel casing melted, the foamed structure refractory lining exhibited only 10 12 mm of wear at the molten steevslag irrçace after 1 hour and only 2 mm at the level below the said interface. Having regard to the severity of the test conditions, these results indicate that the refractory composition yields good erosion resistance.
