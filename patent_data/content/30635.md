# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING COMPLEX CHARACTERS

## Abstract
A character compaction and generation method and apparatus which is particularly adapted to the generation of complex characters such as Kanji characters. A dot matrix defining a given character is compacted into a sparse matrix, with the original character being recon structed for printing or display from the compacted character defined in the sparse matrix. Each character in the complex character set is compacted and stored in memory 50 one time only, with decompaction being performed each time a given character is to be generated. A set of symbols are defined to represent different patterns which occur frequently in the entire complex character set. Different combinations of the symbols define a given character. The information stored for each sparse matrix representing a given character is com prised of each symbol in the sparse matrix, its position, and its size parameter if the symbol represents a family of patterns which differ only in size. Three groups A, B, C, of different patterns are defined which occur frequently in the complex character set, namely, a first group A which has a fixed size for each pattern, a second group B which has one size para meter which must be specified for each pattern, and a third group C which has a plurality of size parameters which must be specified for each pattern. Certain ones of the characters have elements of different patterns which overlap, such that the character may be encoded utilizing less symbols, and according less bytes of data. A given pattern may be gener ated at the same time another pattern is being decoded.
