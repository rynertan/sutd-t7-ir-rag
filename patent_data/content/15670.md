# Process and apparatus for controlling the deposition of a liquid onto a moving surface.

## Abstract
A jet of liquid 3 is deposited from a reservoir outlet 2 on to a moving surface 4 located below the outlet. Desposition is effected by discharging a jet of the liquid on to the underside of a curved guide member 5 which is disposed between the outlet and the moving surface and which is oriented so as to cause the liquid to flow down the member on its underside so that its direction of flow approaches the direction of travel of the moving surface. The invention is particularly advantageous in the pro duction of paper webs, especially multi layer paper webs on a Fourdrinier paper making machine.
