# TEST EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
A gas meter 11 has a rotational indicator viewed by a photo switch 30 . Air is passed by a highly accurate bell prover along gasways 27 and through the meter. A test, automatically conducted by a controller, comprises compar ing the volume measured by the bell prover with the nominal value of a complete rotation of the meter s indicator as signalled by the photo switch. The controller has a print out section which shows whether the meter is within a pre determined accuracy range, and if not, what correction is required.
