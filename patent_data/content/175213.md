# SPEED VARIATOR FOR LAUNDRY WASHING MACHINE

## Abstract
A speed variator for a laundry washing machine compris ing a drum 6 mounted for rotation in a laundering tub 5 and adapted to be rotated at different speeds by a motor 7 via a transmission belt 8 interconnecting a driving pulley 9 of mo tor 7 and a driven pulley 10 associated with the drum. The driving pulley 9 of the speed variator is of the variable diame ter type and cooperates with a number of radially expandable flyweights 14 The driving pulley 9 and the motor 7 are carried by a ro tatable carrier arm 19 having one of its ends hingedly con nected to a lower portion of the tub 5 , while its other end is connected to a piston 29 mounted for reciprocating displace ment to different operating positions in a cylinder 39 con nected through a solenoid valve 31 to the water supply circuit of the machine. The carrier arm 19 is biased by a torsion spring 25 to a position in which the driving pulley 9 is effective to keep the belt 8 under tension against the action caused by the radial expansion of the flyweights 14 . The piston 29 acts on the carrier arm 19 in a manner to interdict or to permit the radial expansion of the flyweights 14 to varying degrees depending on the respective position of the piston. As a result, the effective diameter of the driving pulley 9 is varied by different degrees, permitting the drum 6 to be ro tated at variable speeds.
