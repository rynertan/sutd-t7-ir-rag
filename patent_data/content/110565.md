# A rotor for a rotary pump.

## Abstract
When as the dimensions of an inner rotor of a rotary pump utilizing the trochoidal curve, a diameter of a base cir cle is represented by A mm, a diameter of a rolling circle by B mm, a diameter of a rotary path by C mm, an eccentricity by e mm, an eccentricity ratio by f The invention provides a rotor for a rotary pump which is at least substantially free from the generation of a dupli cate portion or an edge portion.
