# Photographic paper accommodating apparatus.

## Abstract
A photographic paper accommodating apparatus is disposed between a photographic paper printing section and a developing section so as to absorb or retain the slack in a continuous photographic paper fed from the former to the latter which occurs due to a difference between the respec tive processing speeds at these sections. First clamping and transporting rollers 30, 32 are provided on the downstream side of the printing section so as to define a first photo graphic paper looping area between the printing section and the first clamping and transporting rollers. Second clamping and transporting rollers 90, 98 are provided on the down stream side of the first clamping and transporting rollers so as to define a second photographic paper looping area between the first and second clamping and transporting rollers. A guide member 70 is movable between a first position at which it guides the photographic paper from the printing section to the first clamping and transporting rollers and a second position at which the guide member guides the paper from the first clamping and transporting rollers to the second clamping and transporting rollers.
