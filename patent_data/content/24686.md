A m .Alloys of the invention may be processed to yield either isotropic or anisotropic magnet properties.

FIG. 2 shows magnetic prpperties as a function of weight percent cobalt for Fe Cr Co Cu alloys containing 33 weight percent Cr, 2 weight percent Cu, remainder Flue and Fe Cr Co alloys containing 33 weight percent Cr and remainder Fe. Alloys were processed by deformation aging.Detailed Description In accordance with the invention it has been realized that Fe Cr Co Cu alloys which contain Cr in a preferred range of 22 38 weight percent, Co in a preferred range of 3 30 weight percent, and Cu in a preferred range of 0.2 5 weight percent and remainder essentially Fe can be produced to have desirable magnetic properties. Typical properties are remanence Er in a range of 8000 14000 gauss, coercivity Hc in a range of 200 1500 oersted 15,920 119,400 A m , and energy product BH max in a range of 1.0 15.0 million gauss oersted 79.6 1194 MC A m .In addition to Fe, Cr, Co, and Cu, alloys may contain one or several additional elements such as, e.g.,Si, Al, Zr, Ti, Mo, V, Nb, Ta, W and Mn, preferably in a combined amount not exceeding 5 weight percent, and Y,La, and lanthanide series elements, preferably in a combined amount not exceeding 0.5 weight percent. Alloys of the invention may be prepared, e.g., by casting from a melt of constituent elements Fe, Cr, Co, andCu or their alloys in a crucible or furnace such as, e.g., an induction furnace. Alternatively, a metallic body having a composition within the specified range may be prepared by powder metallurgy. Preparation of an alloy and, in particular, preparation by casting from a melt calls for care to guard against inclusion of excessive amounts of impurities as may originate from raw materials, from the furnace, or from atmosphere above the melt.If such care is taken and, in particular, if sufficient care is taken to minimize the presence of impurities such as, e.g., nitrogen, addition of ferrite forming elements may be dispensed with. To minimize oxidation or excessive inclusion of nitrogen, it is desirable to prepare a melt with slag protection, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere such as, e.g., an argon atmosphere. Levels of specific impurities are preferably kept below 0.05 weight percent C, 0.05 weight percent N, 0.5 weight percent Mg, 0.5 weight percent Ca, 0.1 wieght percent S, and 0.05 weight percent 0. While the alloys of the present invention can be directly cast into final shape prior to heat treatment, inyots cast from a melt may be processed by additional steps such as, e.g., hot working, cold working, and solution annealing for purposes such as grain refining, shaping, or the development of desirable mechanical properties in the alloy. Additional processing steps such as, e.g., forming into final magnet shape, or machining may also be included during or after the preliminary processing. Such additional steps may also be carried out before or after aging heat treatment. Aging heat treatment to produce a desirable spinodally decomposed multi phase structure may be carried out by several previously disclosed methods as described e.g., in U. S. patent 4,075,437, U. S. patent applicationSerial No. 924,137, filed July 13, 1978, now U. S. patent no. 4,174,983, U. S. patent application Serial No. 924,138, filed July 13, 1978, now Belgian Patent no. 877,631 orU. S. patent application Serial No. 0 1N5,115, Jin, S. 3 filedFebruary 28, 1979. Isotropic magnet properties are obtained in the alloys of the invention by aging heat treatment in the absence of a magnetic field and without intermediate deformation. Anisotropic, high energy magnet properties are obtained by using magnetic field heat treatment or intermediate deformation. An advantage realized by the new alloys is illustrated in FIG. 1 which shows superior squareness ofB H hysteresis loop for an alloy of the invention containing 2 weight percent Cu as compared with two prior art alloys. Another advantage is illustrated in FIG. 2 which shows a superior magnetic energy product for an alloy of the invention as compared with a prior art alloy. Such advantages of the new alloys are significant in view of the lower cost of copper as compared with cobalt and further in view of slower kinetics of spinodal decomposition when Cu is substituted for a corresponding ar,aount of Co, slower kinetics being particularly desirable in the processing of heavy section rods.Excessive amount of Cu addition such as, e.g., above 5 weight percent is not desirable in the interest of minimizing chemical segregation in cast ingots and cracking during hot working. The following examples are of various Fe Cr Co and Fe Cr Co Cu alloy compositions which were processed by a variety of processing methods to yield isotropic or anisotropic magnetic properties. Samples were prepared by vacuum induction melting or elemental alloy constituents, casting, hot rolling at temperatures in the range of 11001200 degrees C, cold working, and solution annealing for 30 minutes at a temperature of approximately 950 degrees C.Subsequent processing was as described for individual examples.
