# COMPOSITIONS FOR IMPARTING TEMPORARY WET STRENGTH TO PAPER

## Abstract
A composition for imparting temporary wet strength to paper comprising a solution containing from about one percent to about ten percent by weight of a vinylamide polymer having sufficient glyoxal reactive amide substi tuents and CHOHCHO substituents to be thermosetting, in a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, water miscible solvents containing free hydroxyl functionality, and mixtures thereof, to which solution has been added a sufficient quantity of a strong base for reaction therewith to adjust the pH of the aqueous solution to a value of from about 8.5 to about 11. Also disclosed is a process for imparting temporary wet strength to paper by application thereto of a wet strengtheningly effective amount of such aqueous composition, and the paper product of such process.
