## Description
PRODUCTION OF MATERIAL OF HIGH IIUNOSUPPRESSIVE ACTIVITY The present invention relates to the production of a new composition of matter of high immunosuppressive activity. The compound l thiocarbamoyl 2 imidazolidinone of the formula svnthesizedEMI1.1 i n Helv. Chem. Acta Vol. 49 1966 pages 2443 6 is disclosed as an intermediate in making other, structurally remote compounds of niridazole like activity against schistosoma, parasites which enter the blood streams and debilitate millions of people in Asia and Africa. Niridazole, i.e. 5 nitro 2 thiazolyl 2 imidazolid inone, is the treatment of choice. It has now been found that this l thiocarbamoyl 2 imidazolinone intermediate is markedly active in suppressing immune responses such as might be encountered in tissue grafts, and the like The product can be prepared chemically according to the following reaction scheme EMI1.2 The starting materials react in a one to one stoichiometry but advantageously thiourea is employed in excess, e.g. at least about six times the stoichiometric amount, to minimize substitution at the second free thioamide nitrogen. The reactions can be effected in water, water miscible solvents such as lower alkanols, acetone or dioxane, or water immiscible solvents such as benzene or other hydrocarbons, chlorobenzene and the like.The reaction temperature can be up to the boiling point of the solvent, if present, preferably at about 20 to 70 C. Ring closure can be effected with the aid of an alkaline acid binding agent, e.g. alkali metal or ammonium hydroxide or carbonates or tertiary amines such as pyridine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, and the like. The by product salt which forms is water soluble and in that manner can be separated from the desired product which can then be recrystallized from ethanol. An illustrative process for the preparation of the active material synthetically is shown in the following example EXAMPLE 1 To a solution of 19.0 g 250 nmol of tliiourca in 100 ml of acetone, containing 12.5 g 90 mmol of anndrous potassiun carbonate, which was heatcd to 500C, was added drupwise with stirring over a 90 minute period, a solution of 5.0 g 47.4 mmol of 2 chlorocthyl isocyanate diluted in 150 ml of acetone. Tulle rcaction mixturc was stirred for two more hours at 500C.After tlie insoluble carbonate was removed by flltra tion, the solution was evaporated to dryncss at 45 C under reduced pressure. The solids wliicli remained were dissolved in 373 ml of N,N dirnethylformamide and heated to 94 C. Fourteen grinds of ss dium acetate trihiydrate were added in one lot and the mixture stirred for 30 minutes at 94 C.After tulle solution Iliad cooled to 450c, tulle Solvent was rernuvcd by rotary evaporation. The solids were dissolved in 100 ml of water. Upon standing at 4 C, 1.8 g of crystals were deposited which contained approximatcly 902 by weight of a product, which cochromatographed with the product fromExample 3, when subjected to analytical high pressure liquid chromato graphy as in Example 3. Recrystallization from 60 ml of water gave 1.44 g of white crystals which melted at 203.5 to 205.5 C uncorrected and which was substantially free of tlliourea. Traces of the starting material were removed by chromatography of the product in 250 mg lots on a Sephadex Ll1 20 5 x 60 cm which was developed with water.Under these conditions, thiourea eluted after about one bed volume of solvent had passed tllrollgll, wllereas the major product eluded after about two bed volumes. Finally, highly purified product 99 by weight was obtained in milligram quantities by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography, using water as the solvent, as follows A pBondapak C18 column was washed with 10 column volumes of acetonitrile Burdick Jackson, uv quality solvent and then equilibrated with water which was highly purified by passage through a Milli Q system Millipore Corporation . When chromatography was done in water at a flow rate of 4.0 ml minute, the active material eluted with a retention time of 21.6 minute.Again the column effluent was monitored at 256 nm and at the appropriate time, active material was collected. The volume of the collected effluent was reduced to 4 ml by rotary evaporation at 30 C. Product was recovered as fine white powder after lyophilization. When foreign tissues enter a human body, the body s immune system produces a migration inhibitory factor MIF to reject such tissues. Agents which block or prevent the production of MIF are termed immunosuppressive agents and are effective in reducing allergic and rejection responses as in organ and tissue transplants. The active material synthesized hereinabove exhibits such activity which can be demonstrated clearly with laboratory animals, e.g by an assay procedure such as that described byDavid and David at page 249 of their In Vitro Methods inCell Mediated Immunity edited by Bloom et al Academic Press, 1971 . A capillary tube technique with modified Mackaness chambers is employed to measure the MIF activity resulting from the addition of various levels of OCB BGG and get to peritoneal exudate cells PEC obtained from Hartley guinea pigs sensitized to this antigen. The culture medium is Eagle s Minimal EssentialMedium with penicillin 100 units ml and streptomycin 100 pg ml , and is made to contain 15 normal guinea pig serum.Chambers are incubated for 24 hours at 37 C. Areas of migration are projected, traced, and quantitated by planimetry, MIF production being expressed as percent inhibition of migration, calculated as EMI5.1 tb SEP inhibition SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP area SEP of SEP migration SEP in SEP presence SEP of tb SEP antigen tb SEP X SEP . SEP X SEP 100 tb SEP area SEP of SEP migration SEP in SEP presence SEP of tb SEP antigen tb Twenty percent or greater inhibition of migrati9p usually represents significant MIF production by this assay accerding to the Student s t test. More specifically, the compound of the invention, l thiocarbamoyl 2 imidazolidinone, at 100 ng. ml., significantly inhibits p .01 macrophage migration inhibitory factor MMIF , which is produced by incubation of sensitized guinea pig lymphocytes in the presence of 125 units ml. of PPD purified protein derivative as antigen. The measurement of inhibition of tM1IF to determine immuno suppressant activity is described by Bloom et al., Science 153, 80 82 1966 David et al., J. Inununol. 93, 264 273 1964 George et al.,Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 111, 514 521 1962 and Kreici et al., Immunology 16, 677 684 1969 l. As shown by the data presented in Table 1 below, using the Jerne plaque assay described by Jerne et al., Ccll Bound Antibody Amos and Koprowski, eds. , pages 109 125,Wistar Institute Press, Philadelphia 1963 , l thiocarbamoyl 2 imidazolidinone, identified as Cpd. , was found to suppress Ig antibody immunoglob lin M, 19S at concentrations from 0.01 to o.l mg. kg. against sheep red blood cells as antigen when administered orally to mice for three days.For purposes of comparison, data are also included for the known immunoregulator,Tilorone, 2,7 bis 2 diothylamino ethoxy fluoren 9 one, identified as Ref. . Results are expressed in terms of theImmunomodulation Index, which is the ratio of the PFC 106 Lymphocyte count for the test compound at a particular dose vs. control, a ratio greater than unity indicating immunoenhancement and a ratio less than unity indicating immunosuppression.
