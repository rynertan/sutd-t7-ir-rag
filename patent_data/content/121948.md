# Process for producing a fat having butter like properties and a reduced tendency to develop graininess.

## Abstract
I. Development of excessive graininess in fats i which are prone to graininess can be reduced by incorporating therein a fat ii consisting of triglycerides from unsaturated fatty acids in the trans configuration. II. Margarine fats with butter like properties and dis playing a reduced tendency to graininess are produced e.g. by interesterification of a fat rich in palmitic acid residues, particularly palm oil or fractions thereof, with triglycerides from C₁₈ C₂₄ unsaturated fatty acids in the trans con figuration.
