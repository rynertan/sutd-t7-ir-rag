## Description
ABSORPTION OF ADDITIVES INTO POLYMER SURFACES FROM SOLUTION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polymeric materials have enjoyed increasingly wider use in industrial and consumer products, replacing or supplementing other materials such as metals, wood and ceramics. Chemical additives are often employed with the polymer to adapt the physical or chemical properties for particular needs. Thus, depending on requirements, it may be desirable to add one or more substances such as heat stabilizers, ultraviolet light stabilizers, antistatic agents, colorants, electrically conductive materials, flame retardant agents, smoke suppressants, foaming agents, and others.Incorporation of the additive may be accomplished by use of various methods, including dry, solution or melt blending with the polymer prior to or during thermal processing into the finished article. In some instances, the additive is merely coated onto the surface of the polymeric article, as in the case of certain anti static agents which dissipate static charges or light stabilizers which absorb ultraviolet radiation. In one prior art procedure for incorporating an ultraviolet light stabilizer into the surface of a molded polyphenylene ether resin blend, the stabilizer is dissolved in a solvent, the molded piece is immersed in the solution, and the stabilizer is absorbed into the molded surface. A disadvantage of this procedure is that the solvent aggressively attacks the polymer surface, making it tacky when wet, and thus difficult to handle until the surface is thoroughly dried. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION The present invention comprises in one aspect, a novel method for incorporating an additive from solution into a polymer surface, making use of a miscible blend of at least two liquids, one of which is a relatively good solvent for the polymer and additive, the other of which is a poorer solvent or nonsolvent for the polymer. Upon contacting the polymer with the liquid blend, the additive is readily absorbed, yet the surface does not become tacky. A result is that the workpiece can be more easily handled immediately after treatment. The method of this invention can be utilized to add various additives to pre formed polymeric articles or to non polymeric articles having a polymeric coating or surfacing. Conditions can be regulated to increase or decrease the amount of additive incorporated, as will be explained in greater detail. Another facet of the invention comprises articles which have been treated in accordance with the aforementioned method. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In general, the process of the invention comprises the steps of a contacting an article comprising a polymeric surface with a solution of an additive for the polymer in a miscible blend of two or more liquids, at least one of which is a solvent for the polymer and at least one of which is a relatively poorer solvent, or nonsolvent, for the polymer b maintaining the contacting for a period sufficient to absorb an effective amount of the additive into the polymeric surface and c drying the liquid blend from the surface to obtain an article having the additive incorporated within. By way of illustration, the additive or additives with which the polymer surface is to be treated is are first dissolved in a blend of two or more liquids as described above. The amount of additives can be varied as described to prepare a dilute, medium strength or concentrated solution. Preferably, however, the additive is dissolved in amounts near or at the limit of solubility, so as to provide a longer lasting solution which has less need for replenishment as more of the additive is absorbed into the polymer surface. Examples of additives which may be employed are ultraviolet light stabilizers, heat stabilizers, antioxidants, colorants for example, pigments or dyes , antistatic agents, flame retardant agents, smoke suppressants, foaming agents, electrical conductivity agents, lubricants and abrasion resistants. After the solution of the additive has been prepared, the polymeric article is immersed in it. Any suitable container may be used for this purpose, in cluding glass lined or stainless steel vessels.Immersion times vary from several seconds to several minutes or more, depending on a number of factors, including the nature of the polymer surface, the type of additive, the amount of additive to the incorporated and the composition of the solvent blend. Generally, the time period required for treatment can be shortened by use of a stronger solvent or solvents in the blend, or by the use of a higher ratio of better solvent to poorer solvent, either of which will facilitate absorption of the additive into the surface. Conversely, longer treatment times are required with use of weaker solvents or a lower ratio of better solvent to poorer solvent in the blend. Absorption of the additive may also be facilitated by heating the solvent blend shortly prior to or during contacting with the polymer surface.Heating at elevated temperaturer above room temperature e.g., above 230C, and up to the boiling point of the blend is possible, but care should be taken not to greatly exceed that temperature if an open container is used, otherwise undesirable large amounts of the solvents may be lost to the atmosphere through volatilization. After the immersion has been completed, the surface or surfaces of the article are dried to remove the solvent. Drying may be accomplished,for example, by permitting the article to stand at room temperature, or by blowing air across the wet surface, or by heating in an enclosure, such as an oven. The method which has been described is useful to incorporate additives into the surface of a broad spectrum of polymeric materials, including those of poly alkenyl aromatics , for example, polystyrene polyvinyl chlorides polyamides polyesters, for example, poly alkylene terephthalates such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate polyurethanes both polyester and polyether based polycarbonates polyolefins polyphenylene oxides or ethers polyacrylicj acrylonitrile butadienestyrene terpolymers ABS and so forth. Special mention is made of polyphenylene oxide resin, and especially of homopolymers and copolymers made up of units of the formulaEMI5.1 in which Q, 0 , Q and Q are, independently, selected from among hydrogen, halogen, hydrocarbon, halohydrocarbon, hydrocarbonoxy, and halohyrocarbonoxy and n represents the total number of monomer units and is an integer of at least about 20, and more usually at least 50. These can be prepared using known procedures, including those described by Hay in U.S. PatentNos. 3,306,874 and 3,306,875, and by Stamatoff inU.S. Patent Nos. 3,257,357 and 3,257,358, incorporated herein by reference, from the reaction of phenols including but not limited to 2,6 dimethylphenol 2,6diethylphenol 2,6 dibutylphenol 2,6 dilaurylphenol 2, 6 dipropylphenol 2,6 diphenyphenol, 2 methyl 6ethylphenol 2 methyl 6 cyclohexylphenol 2 methyl 6tolylphenol 2 methyl 6 methoxyphenol 2 methyl 6butylphenol 2,6 dimethoxyphenol, 2,3, 6 trimethyiphenol 2,3,5,6 tetramethylphenol and 2, 6 diethoxyphenol. Examples of some of the polymers which can thus be prepared are poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4 phenylene ether , poly 2,6 diethyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2,6 dibutyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2,6 dilauryl l, 4 phenylene ether , poly 2,6 dipropyl l,4 phenylene ether , poly 2 ,6 diphenyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2 methyl 6 ethyl l , 4 phenylene ether , poly 2 methyl6 cyclohexyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2 methyl 6 tolyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2 methyl 6 methoxy l, 4 phenylene ether , poly 2 methyl 6 butyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2,6 dimethoxy 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2,3,6 trimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether , poly 2,3,5,6tetramethyl 1,4 phenylene ether , and poly 2,6 die thoxy 1,4 phenylene ether . Also useful are copolymers prepared from mixtures of the aforementioned phenols, such as 2,6 dimethylphenol employed in conjunction with, for instance, 2,3,6 trimethyiphenol or 2 methyl 6 butylphenol, to provide, for instance, poly 2,6 dimethyl co 2 , 3, 6 trimethyl l , 4 phenylene ether . Most preferred are polymers within the above formula where Q and 0 are alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and especially poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4phenylene ether . These resins can be used in combination with other polymeric materials such as rubber modified high impact polystyrene HIPS or impact modifying styrene co and terpolymers, or still others, to form compositions which are extrudable or moldable into various shaped objects or coatings suitable for treatment in accordance with the process of this invention. After treatment in accordance with this invention, the polymeric surface can be evaluated to determine the extent of additive absorption by use of any number of conventional testing procedures. With particular reference to ultraviolet light stabilizers, for instance, this can take the form of exposing the treated surface to sunshine or artificial weathering devices, followed by measuring the degree of polymer degradation by monitoring the change in tensile strength, carbonyl development, or, as shown in the working examples, yellowness index.
