# Complex quotient nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

## Abstract
In an NMR imaging system, an image plane is scanned and NMR signals are collected over a plurality of image lines. The experiment is repeated, with the timing of the excitation pulses changed. Images are formed by performing Fourier transformations of the signal values, A ratio image is then formed by performing a complex division of the two images on a pixel by pixel basis. The ratio values cancel phase error effects in the image data and the use of complex numbers maintains the proper pixel polarity.
