# Zeolitic reforming catalyst and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
A highly active and selective zeolitic reforming catalyst comprises a type L zeolite containing platinum metal and at least one promoter selected from iron, cobalt, titanium and the rare earth metals, the catalyst having a platinum to pro moter metal mole ratio of less than 10 1. In one embodiment a type L zeolite is formed by combining an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, and ferric ni trate with an aqueous solution of silica to form a thickening gel in a mother liquor heating the thickening gel to form a type L zeolite cooling the gel containing the type L zeolite decanting the mother liquor from the gel filtering the type L zeolite from the gel washing the filtered type L zeolite so that the pH of the wash is about 10.5 and drying the washed type L zeolite. The catalyst is formed by adding platinum to the dried type L zeolite by pore fill impregnation with an aqueous solution of Pt NH₃ ₄ NO₃ ₂ to form a catalyst drying the catalyst and then calcining the dried catalyst.
