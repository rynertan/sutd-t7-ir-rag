## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION METAL INSULATOR SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE AND METHOD FOR THEFABRICATION THEREOF.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. This invention is related to a metal insulator semiconductor type device and its fabricating method, and more particularly to a structure of a MIS device allowing the formation of a contact region for an electrode of the device, and improving the packing density. In a MIS device, it is important to obtain a good ohmic contact at a contact region, in order to attain a high reliability of the semiconductor device. As the scale of integration of the semiconductor device increases, the total size and number of the contact regions increase. The size of the contact region is related directly to the packing density of the semiconductor device. Therefore, it is essential to provide a structure and a fabricating method which allow to decrease the size and number of the contact regions to attain a high integration density. In a MIS integrated circuit IC device, three terminal field effect transistors FET are basically arranged in a commonsource, common drain, or common gate configuration in order to increase the packing density. In the basic common source configuration, for example, the source regions of the MIS FETs are connected to a semiconductor substrate region, or well region, on which each MIS FET is fabricated, through a wiring layer, and are kept at the same potential. In many cases, the semiconductor substrate is supplied with a reference voltage. Generally, in a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS integrated circuit IC , substrate contact regions and well contact regions are positioned one by one for each FET. Each of the contact regions is connected to each electrode of the CMOS FET by metal wiring lines. Such wiring lines for each one of the FETs decrease the integration density of the IC, and disturb its fabrication. A structure of a MIS FET fabricated in a conventional MISIC is shown Figures 1A, 1B, 1C where Figure 1A is a plan view of a prior art MIS FET, Figure 1B is a sectional view along the lineA A of Figure 1A and Figure 1C is a sectional view along the lineB B of Figure 1A. In these figures, 1 is the semiconductor substrate of theMIS FET. A source region 5 of a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate 1, and a contact diffusion region 7 of the same conductivity type as the substrate 1 are formed on said substrate 1. Contact windows ova, 10b, 10c for each electrode are formed on insulating layers 8 and 9, the latter being a layer of phosphosilicate glass PSG .10a is a source electrode contact window corresponding to the source region 5, lOb is a drain electrode contact window corresponding to the drain region 6, and 10c is a substrate electrode contact window corresponding to the substrate contact region 7.Such electrode contact windows are connected by a wiring layer the source region 5 is connected to the substrate 1 by a wiring La, the potentials of the source region and the substrate being the same. Reference numeral 2 is a field oxide film, 3 is a gate oxide film, La is a metal wiring line for a reference voltage, and Lb is a metal wiring line supplied with a voltage different from the reference voltage. According to the prior method for fabricating a MIS FET, it is necessary to provide a certain distance dA between a gate electrode 4 and an n type contact region 7 in order to secure a width for the p type source region 5 and a margin for mask alignment. The width W1 of the n type contact region 7 is necessary to assure a proper positioning margin so that the electrode contact window 10c does not protrude from the n type contact region 7. Moreover, in the direction parallel to the gate electrode 4, electrode contact windows 10a and 10c must be provided with a proper positioning margin dC and dD in order to maintain the separation between them. In the prior art, positioning margins dB, dC and dD for contact diffusion regions are provided by enlarging the size of the contact regions, thereby decreasing the integration density of the MIS IC.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a structure of a semiconductor device, more particularly a structure of a MIS IC allowing to increase the packing density of the circuit elements. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating this device. The foregoing objects are accomplished by a semiconductor device including a MIS type circuit element which comprises, according to the invention A semiconductor body having one conductivity type, and said MIS type circuit element being fabricated in said semiconductor body an electrode region having an opposite conductivity type to that of the body a contact region having the same conductivity type as said semiconductor body, said contact region being fabricated by the conversion of a part of said electrode region and having a depth such that it reaches said semiconductor body a insulating layer covering said electrode region a common contact window opened in said insulating layer and through which the surface of said contact region and a part of said electrode region are exposed and a common wiring line formed over the common contact window for connection to said contact region and electrode region. Thus, the contact regions for the electrode source region and the substrate region are combined to a single contact window. Said single contact window is formed in a part of the electrode source region of each FET, by doping with an impurity which has the same conductivity type as the substrate or well region on which the FET is fabricated, said doping being performed at a high dose and deep enough to reach the substrate or well region. Thereafter, the source region is electrically connected directly to the substrate or well region. The positioning margin for each of the contact regions is then reduced and, moreover, the wiring for connecting them is eliminated. The packing density of the device is therefore increased. These and other features and advantages of the device and method according to the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description made in connection with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1A is a schematic plan view of a pattern layout of a prior art semiconductor device.

Figures 2A, 2B and 2C show a p channel MOS FET p MOS according to the present invention. A contact window 209 for a p type source 16, hereinafter common contact window, is formed with a rectangular shape. Through the center part of this window 20s, an n type impurity is selectively doped at a high dose into the p source region 16 and the center part of the p type source region 16 is converted to an n type conductivity region 21. As shown in the figure the high dose region 21 becomes wider than the window 20s, because of the diffusion. The detail of such diffusion will be disclosed later with respect to Figure 5. The n type substrate contact diffusion region 21 is deep enough to reach the n type substrate 11, so that in n type contact region 21 is formed in the center part of the contact window 20s. When a common wiring line 23s is fabricated on insulating layers of phospho silicate glass PSG 19, as shown in the figures, the p type source region 16 and n type contact region 21 are connected to each other Figure 2C . As a result, the p type source region 16 is electrically connected to the contact region 21 which is electrically connected to n type silicon substrate 11. Therefore, the above regions are at the same potential despite the presence of a p n junction between them, and they are connected to a common wiring line 23s. A diffusion region 22, which is a p type region compensated by impurity, is formed at a part of a drain region 17 by diffusion through an opening 20D Compensated diffusion is a conventional technique widely used to prevent a contact region from a short of p n junction. In particular, the compensated diffusion technique is useful to obtain good ohmic contact at the contact region, in order to attain high reliability of the semiconductor device. An impurity region of an element of a semiconductor device is usually formed by diffusing an impurity material dopant into a specified region of the substrate, which region is hereafter called diffusion region, In Figures 2A, 2B and 2C, 12, 13 and 14 are respectively a n type channel cut region, a field oxide film, and a gate oxide film, and 15 is a polycrystalline silicon gate electrode.These are all widely used in conventional MOS device and their description is ommited for sake of simplicity. As described above, the contact windows for the source region 16 and substrate region 21 are combined to one common opening contact window 20s. Compared to the prior construction of the figure 1, the wiring line from the source region to the substrate region is omitted, and the positioning margin required for positioning each contact window with respect to each region 16 or 21 becomes unnecessary. Therefore, the scale of integration of the semiconductor device is increased. Figure 3A is a schematic plan view of a pattern layout ofCMOS FET according to a second embodiment of the present invention, which includes a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS structure, Figure 3B, 3C and 3D being schematic cross sectional views respectively taken along the linesA A, B B and C C of Figure 3A. Reference numeral 31 denotes an n type silicon substrate, 32 is a p type well region, 33 is an n channel cut region, 34 is a p channel cut region, 35 is a field oxide film, 36 is a gate oxide film, 37a and 37b are polycrystalline silicon gate electrodes, 38 is a p type source region, 39 is a p type drain region, 40 is an n typesource region, 41 is an n type drain region, 42 is an oxide film for impurity material blockade, 43 is an insulating layer of phospho silicate glass PSG 44D and 45D are electrode contact windows for drain regions, 46 is a contact region for n type substrate, 47 is a contact region for p type well, 48 is a p type compensation diffusion region, 49 is an n type compensation diffusion region, 50D is a drain wiring layer of a p MOS and 51D is a drain wiring layer of an n MOS.The substrate region 31 and well region 32 of elements of a semiconductor device are usually formed by diffusing impurity material dopant to a specified region in a substrate, which will be called hereinafter semiconductor body . The fabrication process will be described later referring to Figures 4A to 4F. In the p MOS of the CMOS FET, as shown in Figure 3A to 3D, a rectangular electrode contact window 44s is formed on the source region 38. An n type impurity material of high concentration is selectively doped into a center part of the contact window 44s, which produces a conversion region and an n type substrate contact region 46 is selectively formed, reaching into the region of the n type silicon substrate 31. The selective doping is performed in a manner similar to the one described with respect toFigures 2A to 2C. The detail of this selective doping will be described later with respect to Figure 5. Similarly, in the n MOS of the CMOS FET, a rectangular common contact window 45s is formed in the source region 40. A p type impurity material of high concentration is selectively doped into a part of the n type source region 40. As a result, a conversion region is produced and a p type well contact diffusion region 47 is selectively formed, which reaches into the region of the p type well region 32. As shown in Figures 3A to 3D, the p type source region 38 is connected to the n type substrate contact region 46 which is electrically connected to the n type silicon substrate 31. Said regions are then held at the same potential by means of a common wiring line 50s despite the presence of p n junction between them. Similarly, the n type source region 40 is connected to the p type well contact region 47 which is electrically connected to the p type well region 32. As a result, said regions are held at the same potential by the common wiring line 51s. Therefore, the contact windows for source region and substrate region are combined into a common single window.Compared to the prior construction of figures 1A to 1C, the wiring line from the source region to the substrate region is omitted, and the margin required for contact windows can be neglected the scale of integration of the semiconductor device being therefore increased. A process for fabricating a device according to the present invention will now be disclosed with reference toFigures 4A to 4F which illustrate schematically different steps of the fabrication process. The elementary processing methods used such as etching, insulating layer formation, aluminum sputtering, lithographic technology etc. are conventional ones being well known in the art. Therefore, detailed descriptions regarding these technologies are omitted in the following disclosure. In Figure 4A, reference numeral 33 is the n channel cut region, 34 is the p channel cut region and 35 is the field oxide film. They are formed by using a well known and widely used technology in the art. By a conventional processing such as thermal oxidation, a gate oxide film 36 is formed on the silicon substrate 31 at the p MOS FET region S1. Similarly, at the same time, the gate oxide film 36 is formed on the p type well region 32 which will become the n MOS FET region S2. The polycrystalline silicon gate electrodes 37a and 37b are formed on the gate oxide film 36. They are fabricated by a conventional method such as chemical vapor deposition CVD and patterned by a photolithography. Using the gate electrode 37a or 37b as a mask, boron B , a dopant material, is selectively ion implanted into the n type silicone substrate 31 through the gate oxide layer 36.Similarly, arsenic As , a dopant material, is selectively ion implanted into the p type well region 32. The doping density of boron and arsenic are both in the range of approximatively Ixl 15 atm cm2 to 4x1015 atm cm2 . As a result, a first boron B doped region 52 and a first arsenic As doped region 53 are formed. Figure 4B illustrates a method for fabrication of the common contact windows 44s and 45s, and of the drain electrode contact windows 44D and 45D Using conventional photolithographic technology, as shown in the Figure 4B, the gate oxide film 36 is removed, and the thin oxide layer 42 is formed again all over the substrate by a conventional thermal oxidizing method. This oxide layer 42 is used to block. the impurity materials. Then, the phospho slicate glass PSG insulating layer 43 is formed over the entire substrate. The common contact windows 44s and 45s, at the sources of the p MOSFET and the n MOS FET respectively, and the drain electrode contact windows 44D and 45D are then formed.In order to promote a better understanding, the layout of the common contact windows 44s and liss is shown in the figures hereinafter described, 0 90 rotated from their original orientation as shown in the cross sectional views of Figures 3C and 3D. Figure 4C illustrates a method of formation of phosphorus P doped region 57a or 57b. A first resist pattern 56 is formed on the substrate, and patterned to have openings 54 and 55 in the areas of windows 44s and 45D. The opening 54 is narrower than the opening 44s, and the opening 55 is wider than the opening 45D The difference of size between these openings is effective for mask alignment as will be described later with respect to Figure 5. By using the resist pattern 56 as a mask, phosphor P is selectively ion implanted into the n type silicon substrate 31 through the opening 54 and 44s and into the p type well 32 through the opening 55 and 45 . The doping D15 16 density is in the range of approximately 5x10 to 1X1016 atm cm2 and the acceleration voltage is of 70 to 180 KeV . As a result, the phosphorus P doped region 57a is formed, having a deeper doped region compared to the boron doped region 52. Simultaneously the phosphorus P doped region 57b is formed, having a deeper doped region compared to the arsenic As doped region 53. Figure 5 is a schematic plan view showing the relation between the opening 54 on the first resist pattern 56 and the opening 44s on the PSG layer 43. Since these openings are arranged orthogonally to each other, the opening towards substrate 31 is formed at the cross zone of the openings 54 and 44s. As can be seen in the figure, each of the openings 54 and 448 has a length which exceeds the tolerance of mask, and the alignment is therefore quite easy. The opening 55 for the drain opening 45D also provides enough margin for mask alignment. Turning back to figure 4D, the formation of boron doped region 61a or 61b will be now described. The first resist pattern 56 is removed and a second resist pattern 60 is formed on the substrate and patterned to have openings 58 and 59 in the areas of windows 44D and 45s. The opening 44D is narrower than the opening 59, and the opening 45s is wider than the opening 58. The difference of size between these openings is effective for the mask alignment in a similar manner as described with respect toFigure 5. By using the resist mask 60 as a mask, boron B is selectively ion implanted in the p type well region 32. The doping density is in the range of approximatively 5x1015 to 1x1016 atm cm and the acceleration voltage is of 70 to 180 KeV . As a result, the second B doped region 61a is formed, being a deeper doped region compared to the first arsenic s doped region 53. Simultaneously, the second boron B doped region 61b is formed, being a relatively deeper diffusion region compared to the first boron B doped region 52. That is, the second dopant has a higher concentration than the first, and the second doped region reaches deeper than the first doped region into the substrate 31 or well region 32. Figure 4E relates to an activation process. The second resist pattern 60 is removed from the substrate and annealing is performed at a temperature of about 9500C for 30 minutes in order to activate the doped impurity materials dopant . The doped impurity materials diffuse in the different regions. The p type source region 38, the p type drain region 39, the n type source region 40, the n type drain region 41, the n type substrate contact diffusion region 46, the p type well contact diffusion region 47, the p type compensate diffusion region 48 and the n type compensate diffusion region 49 are formed as shown in Figure lIE. During the activation step of Figure 4E, both the surfaces of the n type substrate contact diffusion region 46 and of the p type source region 38 are exposed through the common contact windows 44s as shown in Figure 6A. The surface of the p type compensate diffusion region 48 is exposed through the drain electrode contact window 44D. Both the surfaces of the p type well contact diffusion region 47 and of the n type source region 40 are exposed through the common contact window 45s of the n MOS FET as shown in Figure 6B. The n type compensate diffusion region 49 is exposed through the drain electrode contact window 45D. Figures 6A and 6B are orientated in the same direction as Figure 3A. Figure 4F relates to the step of fabrication of wiring.Conventional sputtering and lithographic processes are used. The common wiring 50s of p MOS FET is formed covering the common contact window 44s and connecting both the surfaces of the n type substrate contact region 46 and p type source region 38.Generally, an aluminum Al film is used as wiring material.Similarly, the drain wiring 50D of p MOS FET is formed for connection to the surface of the p type compensate diffusion region 48 through the contact window 44D for drain electrode. The common wiring 51s of n MOS FET is formed over the common contact window 45s connecting the p type source region 47 and n type source region 40. The drain wiring 51D for n MOSFET is formed for connection to the n type compensate diffusion region 49 through the electrode contact window 45D.Finally, the entire surface of the substrate is coated with an insulating layer. As described above, the CMOS FET can be formed without additional fabricating process for the IC. According to the present invention, for example, the marginal distance dA dB for the gate electrode and the common contact window can be reduced by 2 um from that of 4 um of the prior art. In addition, a marginal distance dC dD for the electrode contact window of the source region and the electrode contact window for the substrate is unnecessary. With contact windows 38 and 40 as shown in Figures 6A and 6B advantageously enlarged by 2 m in the device of the present invention, a total reduction of marginal distance of 2 yam is obtained. This reduction in marginal space is very large compared to the size of FETs. For example, the size of a FET used in a LSI is approximately 11 um x8 cm . Therefore, it will be understood that the reduction of 2 pom has a large influence on the packing density of the device, which means that the size of an elementary device is decreased by approximately 20 in surface and it will be clearly understood that due to such small sized elements, the packing density of IC can be increased to a greater extent. In the above disclosure ion implantation has been used for the doping with impurities, but it can be replaced by any other known process, such as diffusion.
