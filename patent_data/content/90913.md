# Fuel cell with a molten carbonate electrolyte retained in a lithium titanate containing matrix.

## Abstract
A molten carbonate fuel cell comprising an anode 1 , a cathode 2 and a porous body 3 impregnated with an electrolyte composition of metal carbonates, said body being sandwiched between both the electrodes 1, 2 and being made of one or more refractory, non electron conductive, inorganic materials containing lithium titanate in an amount sufficient to stabilize said inorganic materials at a tempera ture of operation of said fuel cell, and operated by supplying a fuel 5 into a fuel chamber placed in the anode side and an oxidant 6 into an oxidant chamber placed in the cathode side, has improved stability for a long period of time and high fuel cell performance.
