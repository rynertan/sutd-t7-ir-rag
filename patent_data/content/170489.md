# Heating devices.

## Abstract
A heating device, particularly for heating water has passages running between an inlet 13 and an outlet 18 . Closely spaced electrodes 14, 15 connected to electrical supply are arranged within the passages and water is heated as it flows from the inlet to the outlet backwards and forwards between the electrodes. In one embodiment the electrodes 14,15 are perforated parallel plates connected to a.c. mains supply and the passages are defined between coaxial tubes 9, 10, 11 extending perpendicularly to the plates.
