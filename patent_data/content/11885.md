# A control method and device for the preparation of foam material.

## Abstract
A foam material, e.g. for use as a backing material on rugs, is produced by continuously pumping a viscid raw mat erial through a flow meter 12 into a mixer 10 in which the raw material is foamed up by controlled supply of an air flow. For maintaining the density of the foam constant the raw material is passed through a specific weight detector 6 and the foaming air supply is controlled based on the measuring outputs of both the flow meter 12 and the weight detector 6 . According to the invention there is used two specific weight detectors 6, 14 , viz. one at each side of the supply pump 4 , and by processing their combined measuring out puts in a control calculator 20 it is possible to eliminate a control inaccuracy otherwise resulting from the fact that the measurements partly refer to the raw material as under increased pressure compared with the ambient pressure where the foam leaves the mixer.
