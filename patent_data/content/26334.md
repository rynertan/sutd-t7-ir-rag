# Separation unit for use in a device for separating of liquids, especially whole blood.

## Abstract
Device for separating of a liquid, especially whole blood, into fractions having different densities. Said device com prises a separation unit having inlet and outlet means to be connected to an outer source for the liquid, to be separated, and to collection points for the separated fractions, respec tively. Said separation unit is preferably formed as a rigid circu lar disk 1 having an elongated, curved groove 3 5 formed at or on one surface 2 thereof. Said groove may comprise a central semi circular inlet part 3 in fluid communication with a peripherial main part 4 concentric to the center 6 of said disk. Preferably, said main part is extended by a radially inwardly curved end part 5 . In said main part and or the end part of the groove there are separate outlet holes 7, 8 in communication with slits or channels on the other side of said disk for withdrawing of the separated fractions. Especially there is provided a disposable package of sup oporting means, separation unit or disk, housing and a statio nary transferring element, which is adapted to be mounted on any existing drive shaft for rotation.
