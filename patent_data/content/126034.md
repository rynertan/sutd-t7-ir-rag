# Internal combustion engine with direct fuel injection.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine with direct fuel injection includes at least one cylinder 10 , in which is slidable a piston 12 the crown 22 of which has a cavity 24 constituting at least part of the combustion chamber of the cylinder, and a fuel injector 16 with a nozzle having several holes 18 facing the cavity in the piston and oriented so that its axis A is at an angle C of between 15 and 30 to the axis B of the cylinder. The cavity in the crown of the piston has an inclined flat base wall 26 which is oriented perpendicularly to the axis of the injector, and a mouth 25 which is centred on the axis of the cylinder.
