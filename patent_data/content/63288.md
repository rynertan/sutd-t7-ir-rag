# A device for a dust filter.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a device for a dust filter for cleaning a gas flow from dust. The dust filter consists of an electrostatic precipitator or fabric filter bag filter and comprises a filter chamber with gas inlet section 12 and a gas outlet. At the gas inlet a precollector 30 in the form of a louvre collector 31 is located for separating coarse dust, i.e. dust with a diameter exceeding 50 75 Âµm. In the order to obtain good collection at the louvre collector 31 , the collected dust is evacuated by means of a partial gas flow, which is passed to a dust hopper 34 and a dust discharge unit 35 . According to the invention, the dust discharge unit 35 comprises a cyclone collector 36 , the inlet portion 37 of which is integrated with the dust hopper 34 , and the outlet portion of which or central pipe 38 is formed with a passageway 39 , the mouth 40 of which is located in the filter chamber downstream of the louvre collector. The cyclone collector 36 is dimensioned so that the pressure drop over the louvre collector 31 amounting to between 150 and 300 Pa is sufficient to drive the partial gas flow through the cyclone collector, which may be an axial cyclone or a tangential cyclone.
