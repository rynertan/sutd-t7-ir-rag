# Improvements relating to earth leakage protection devices.

## Abstract
And earth leakage protection device comprises a core balance current sensing transformer 1 having a secondary winding 2 in which a fault signal is generated in response to leakage from AC supply lines forming primary windings of the transformer 1 , an operational amplifier OAI for amplifying the fault signal, a precision rectifier circuit 8 comprising a pair of operational amplifiers OA2 and OA3 for performing full wave rectification of the amplified fault signal, delay means 9 in the form of a two stage RC network which delays the rectified signal according to an IDMT characteristic, and a trigger circuit 10 in which the delayed signal is compard with a preset reference signal by an operational amplifier OA4 to provide a control signal which actuates a safety device in the AC supply lines via a relay 11 when the reference signal is exceeded. Within its operating rangs the device actuates the safety device much more slowly for lower leakage currents than for higher currents, and since it is operative on both halves of the AC leakage current signal the device provides reliable protection against the possibility of dangerous electric shocks while avoiding spurious tripping.
