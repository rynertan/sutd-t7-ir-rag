## Description
AUTOMATIC APPARATUS FOR MOISTENING THE WHEAT.The present invention relates to an automatic apparatus for moi stening the wheat.It is known in the art that the wheat to be milled contains from 12 to 15 in weight of moisture said percentage depends on the coop and on t he locality of growing.It is also known that to obtain the perfect milling of the wheat, this latter must contain the optimum value of 17 in wei t of humidity. l1he machines of the prior art provide a manual moisten opera tion of the wheat, and consequently the obtained product doesn t contain the correct quantity of water. itis an object of the present invention to provide an automa tic apparatus to moisten the wheat through an automatic dosage of water to reach the useful value of 17 in weight of humidity in the wheat to be milled, the apparatus according to the present invention carrying out instantaneous measurements on the product to be moistened. Such purpose is obtained, according to the invention, by means of an electronic device comprising a sensitive element set into the feeding duct of the wheat to the humidifier, to continuously take the percentage of humidity in the wheat to be moistened.The results obtained from said measurements operations are first elaborated and then used as parameters of comparision to continuously actuate a dosing device of moistening water the correct percentage of water is added to that one contained in the wheat to reach the suitable humidity in the product.The wheat so moistened is let at rest for 18 20 hours, thus obtaining the suitable percentage of humidity for a good milling of the wheat.The invention will be now described, by way of example, with re ference to the accompanying drawings in which fig. 1 is a front view, partially in section, of the humidity detector unit of the apparatus according to the invention fig. 2 is a view, partially in section, of said detector fig. 3 is a front view, partially in section, of the dosage unit of the apparatus of the invention fig. 4isEsside view, partially in section, of said dosage unit fig. 5 shows the circuit diagram of the control unit for the apparatus of the invention and fig. 6 shows the feeder of said control unit. With reference to the cited drawings, an automatic apparatus to moisten the wheat according to the present invention substantially comprises a a detector unit for measuring the instantaneous humidity per centage of the wheat to be treated. Said detector unit is formed by a cell 1 opened at the upper and lower sides, said cell being upwardly connected to a feeder duct 2 through a throttle valve 3 provided with a counterweight the lower side of the cell 1 is connected to . rotary valve having spaces 4 alternated with solid projections 4 said rotary valve rotates slowly With uniform speed, and it is operated by an electric motor 5, this latter being actuated by said valve 3 through a switch 6 which operates the electronic control unit.The cell 1 is for ned by a crystal envelope and by five upright metallic plates 7 comie .ted by tltrnsX said plate 7 representing the sensiti ve element of an electric control unit. located within a case 8.A little quantity of wheat passes continuously with intermix tent motion thRough the cell 1 and stops within said cell for a little time the remaining part of the wheat to be treated proceeds into the duct 2. The intermittent motion of the little quantity of wheat in the cell 1 is due to the lower rotary valve when under the cell 1 is set one of its spaces 4, the volume of which being equal to that of the cell 1, the wheat leaves the cell 1 itself on the contrary the quantity of wheat conta wined within the cell 1 stops into this latter when the rotary valve is set with one of its projection 4 under the discharge section of the cell 1 the wheat portion passing through the cell 1 into the spaces 4 of the rotary valve, leavos this latter and joines the remaining part of the wheat to be treated.b an electronic control unit formed by a circuit which provides the test voltage at the plates 7 of the sensitive element said circuit substantially comprises an amplifier 01, a tension amplifying unit formed by two operating phases 02 and 03, a ter minal regulator formed by a first separating transistor T1 and one couple of transistors T2 assembled in the Darlington system.Said circuit diagram is completed by the resistor groups the condensers and the diodes assembled according to the diagram of fig. 5, which actSto polarize, stabilize, compensate, protect and couple the cited main components.In operation a portion of the wheat to be treated is drawn by gravity from the duct 2 to fill the cell 1 lowering the valve 3 and causing the switch 6 closes and actuates the unit control the electric motor 5 starts and prates the rotary valve 4 which controls the passage and the permanence of the wheat within the cell 1. The vertical plates 7 of the cell 1 are connec ted between them in groups of twojthree of them, i.e. the first is connected to the third and the fifth, and the second is con nected to the fourth said plates are maintained at the alterna te voltage of the unit control.Due to the presence of the wheat, the sensor element acts as an electric condenser, the plates of which being constituited by the plates 7sand the wheat representing the interposed dielectric the properties of which strictly depends on the humidity of the wheat itself.Indeed the sensitive element act as a condenser with variable impedance, the value of the low electric current flowing into it depending proportionally on the percentage of humidity in the wheat.Thus after a comparision value of the intensity of the electric current has been set e.g. the intensity of currant corresponding to the optimum value of 17 of humidity , any positive or negative variation of current from this value represents, by means of the electronic control unit, the regulation signal which operates the dosage unit.Said regulation is realized controlling the revolving speed of the motor 22 which starts in rotation the wheel 11 in fact any modification of the revolving speed of said wheel, causes a variation on the quantity of water discharged into the container 14 and then distributed on the whole mass of wheat through the discharge duct 15. Tore exactly the signal formed by the microamperometric current within the plates 7 of the sensitive element is supplied by the amplifier 01, rectified by the first operating phase 02, amp Ii fied and then compared in the second operating phase 03 with a signal of reference, said phase 03 acting as an amplifier of the difference of current. ihe signal resting from the comparision phase operates,through the transistor T1, the Darlington phase formed by the transi . stors T2 and T3, said Darlington phase providing the feeding voltage of the motor 12. Aijy variation on the current i itensity in the sensitive member due to the corresponding variations of the humidity percentage in the wheat , provides a similar modification in the feeding voltage of the motor 12 by means of the circuit phases aforedescribed. Said voltage modification in the motor 12 provides a corresponding increasing or lowering of its speed, thus respec timely increasing or lowering the quantity of water furnished from the cups of the wheel 11.The herein described embodiments are illustraDive, and it will be understood that further and equivalent modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
