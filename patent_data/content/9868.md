# Improvements in or relating to a method and to an apparatus for transporting items and plant therefor.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for transporting items such as chopped nuclear fuel pins from a receiving station to a discharge station. The apparatus contains a liquid 25 for transporting the items in an inlet duct 12, 35, 56, 71 which extends downwardly from the receiving station to a region 11, 37, 58, 75 where it is joined to an outlet duct 13, 36, 57, 77 which extends upwardly to the discharge station. The region 11, 37, 38, 75 is connected to a source 27 capable of applying a pressure pulse to the liquid 25 so as to displace the liquid 25 upwardly in at least the outlet duct 13, 36, 57, 77 and thereby transport the items through the apparatus. At least two apparatus may be connected together in series relationship to provide a plant for the transport of the items through the plant.
