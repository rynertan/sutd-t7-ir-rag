# Humidity offset circuit.

## Abstract
The circuit 40 when connected to the bridge 11 of an electronic thermostat 10 will adjust the thermostat and hence the temperature as humidity changes, the output of circuit 40 having at least one humidity value which is equal to a balance value of the bridge. The circuit 40 can be added as a retrofit item or incorporated into the manufacture of the thermostat.
