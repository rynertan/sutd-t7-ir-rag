# Nickel chromium alloy having a dispersed phase.

## Abstract
A novel nickel base high temperature alloy body prefer ably containing about 22 chromium, sufficient aluminium and titanium to provide a Î³ precipitate structure, additional strengthening elements and oxidic yttrium in finely dis persed form. The alloy body has an elongated crystal structure and is characterized by high strength along with excellent hot corrosion and oxidation resistance.
