# Controllable pitch aircraft propeller.

## Abstract
A variable pitch propeller has blades 36 , the position of which, at relatively low pitch angles is controlled by a beta valve through a lever 23 and a feedback collar 25 , the position of the collar being controlled by a plurality of beta feedback rods 55 . There is one rod 55 for each blade of the propeller, and the movement of the rods 55 is controlled by a blade yoke 50 which has arms 52 partially encircling the rods 55 . A lost motion connection in the form of a sleeve 60 is carried on each of the rods 55 and is movable against a retraction spring 62 by the arms 52 . A movable stop mechanism 75 engages the feedback rods 55 at a particular low blade angle position and temporarily inter rupts the movement of the feedback rods 55 while the sleeves 60 move to a seated position against the retraction spring 62 , and thereafter the movement of the rods 55 is again picked up, accompanied by movement of the stop mechanism 75 against a spring 80 . The lost motion connection represented by the sleeve 60 permits move ment of the blades under control of the beta feedback valve without accompanying movement of the feedback rod which causes a shifting of the blades to a still lower pitch position, thereafter followed by reclosing of the feedback valve with continued movement of the rods 55 .
