# Phase locked loop frequency synthesizer.

## Abstract
A programmable divide by N phase locked loop having a pulse incrementor circuit 12 and a single sideband mixer circuit 14 embedded in the loop feedback path is disclosed. In each disclosed arrangement, one input port of the single sideband mixer 14 receives the signals supplied by the phase locked loop voltage controlled oscillator 16 and, depending upon whether the mixer employed is configured for supplying an upper sideband signal or a lower sideband signal, either increases or decreases the frequency of the phase locked loop feedback signal by a factor f
