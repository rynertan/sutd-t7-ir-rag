# Solid heat generating compositions comprising calcium oxide, method of generating heat using such compositions, and use of such compositions in the generation of heat.

## Abstract
A solid heat generating composition utilizes the heat of hydration of calcium oxide, and comprises calcium oxide and a solid substance supplying water capable of reacting with calcium oxide. The use of a solid substance makes possible greater control over the rate and extent of the heat generating hydration reaction than the use of liquid water. The solid substance can be one having water of absorption, adsorption or crystallization, or an organic compound which yields water by an intramolecular or intermolecular reaction at an elevated temperature. The composition can be utilized in various applications requiring heat generation, for example for thawing and heating frozen foods, controlled releasing of agricultural chemicals such as insecticides or repellents, and warming the human body.
