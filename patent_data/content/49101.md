## Abstract
The laminated stator core 19 for an engine ignition system includes in addition to that ignition system an arrange ment for charging the storage battery 13 of an internal com bustion engine powered device during engine operation with a charging coil 41 surrounding one leg 31 of the ignition sta tor core 19 , a capacitor 51 in parallel with the coil 41 , and a rectifier 45 coupled to the charging coil 41 for conveying a varying unidirectional current to the battery 13 . The ignition system may be of the type having a three legged E shaped la minated stator core 19 and a flywheel supported permanent magnet 21 with charging coils 41, 43 being positioned on each of the outer E legs 31, 29 with diodes 45, 47 in series with each charging coil and means connecting the two coil diode series circuits in parallel with one another and to the bat tery 13 for providing a pair of sequential primary charging current pulses to the battery during each revolution of the fly wheel 23 . A fourth laminated stator core leg supporting a charging coil may be employed in some circumstances. In each case, a capacitor 51, 53 is connected directly in parallel with each coil 41, 43 to provide an enhanced charging current to the storage battery 13 .
