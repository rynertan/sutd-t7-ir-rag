# Preparation of higher tin carboxylates.

## Abstract
Tin carboxylates of higher carboxylic acids can be prepared in high yields by a reacting either stannous oxide with an anhydride of a lower organic acid, b reacting the product from a with at least one higher carboxylic acid, and c recovering the tin carboxylate of said higher car boxylic acid.
