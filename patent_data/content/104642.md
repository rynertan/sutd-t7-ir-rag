# Load indicating flange.

## Abstract
A load indicating flange 11 is provided either separate ly or on a nut 12 or a bolt 13 head. This load indicating flange 11 has an axially directed face which has a wavy surface 28 on which a plurality of crests 26 are disposed for initial engagement with a work surface 21 . A plurality of troughs 27 are provided on the wavy surface 28 one each between two of the crests 26 . A gauge groove 33 is provided at each trough 27 and when the bolt and nut combination is properly tightened on a workpiece 22 , the troughs 27 are flattened toward the work surface 21 to such an extent that a relatively thick gauge cannot enter the gauge groove 33 . If the bolt 13 and nut 12 are improperly tightened, then the gauge will enter the gauge groove 33 . A narrow band peripheral bearing surface 39 is provided on the outer periphery of the face to prevent defacing the work surface 21 .
