# Packaging film for photosensitive materials for photographic purpose.

## Abstract
A packaging film for photosensitive materials for photo graphic purpose which is a laminated film at least contain ing a metallized film layer and two polyethylene polymer layers which are located both sides of the metallized film layer, at least one of the above polyethylene polymer layers contains more than 50 wt of linear low density polyethy lene manufactured by low pressure method, one side or both of the above polyethylene polymer layers contains 0.3 to 30 wt of a light shielding material, and strength of one side or both of the above polyethylene polymer layers is stronger than adhesive force between the above metallized film and difference in the thickness of the polyethylene po lymer layers is smaller than 50 . This film is superior various physical strength, moisture proofing, gas barrier, light shielding and antistatic charac ter, and it is superior as a packaging film for a photosensi tive material for photographic purpose.
