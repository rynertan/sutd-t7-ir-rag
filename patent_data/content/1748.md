# A process for improving the physical properties of phosphazene ester polymers by chemical modification with amines.

## Abstract
Improvement of the polyarloxy and polyalkylaryloxyphosphazenes such as those described in United States Patent 3,853,794 is achieved by treating such polyphosphazenes with organic amines, preferably in solution. The polyphosphazenes are chemically modified as a result of such treatment and are converted from tough fibrous materials to relatively soft readily processed products.
