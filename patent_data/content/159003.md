# Method for purification of filamentous hemagglutinin.

## Abstract
Improved method for the purification of filamentous hemagglutinin F HA on industrial scale which comprises contacting a culture of a microorganism of the genus Bor detella with a cellulose sulfate gel, a polysaccharide gel chemically bound with dextran sulfate, or a crosslinked po lysaccharide sulfate gel, thereby adsorbing F HA on the gel, and then eluting F HA from the gel. Said method can give a highly purified F HA which does not contain any other pro teins, lipid, saccharides, etc. and further undesirable endo toxin, and hence can be used for producing various reagents, medicines and pertussis vaccine.
