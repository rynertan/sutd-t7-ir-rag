# CURABLE RESIN COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE

## Abstract
A curable resin composition which comprises 1 a copoiymer composed of an aminoalkyl acrylate and or aminoalkyl methacrylate and a ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 2 a blocked polyisocyanate compound formulated therein. The curable resin composition undergoes curing at by far lowered temperatures as compared with the convention ally employed baking paints consisting of hydroxyl containing resins and blocked polyisocyanate compounds, and are therefore useful, for example, as a low temperature baking type paint or adhesive. Heating brings about the crosslinking through the reaction between isocyanate and amino groups, thus providing coating films with excellent flexibility, chemical resistance, water resistance, impact resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. The composition can be used to such substrates as metal, heat resistant plastics and inorganic materials, and can be applied onto electrical appliances for household uses, automobiles, building mate rials and the like.
