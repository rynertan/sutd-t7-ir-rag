# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGES

## Abstract
In NMR imaging method and apparatus the free induc tion signal obtained from a slice in an object is detected in a quadrature receiver 10 and is modulated in a modulator 13 and then displayed in a video display 14 and photographed as by a camera 15. The photograph is viewed in coherent light and the image represents the Fourier transformation of the free induction signal and hence is an image of the NMR spin density distribution of selected nuclei in the slice. As an alternative modulation may be produced by providing a con stant offset to the main magnetic field.
