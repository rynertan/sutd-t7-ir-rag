## Description
FLEXIBLE SUGARLESS CHEWING GUM The present invention relates to sugarless chewing gum products that are very flexible for prolonged periods of storage and which are prepared by formulating the product with aqueous hydrogenated starch hydrolysate that has been cooked to a moisture content of about 8 4 . Glycerine may also be added with the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate. Regular non bubble sugarless chewing gum, in stick form, and as formulated prior to the present invention, has very poor cohesive, or flexible properties. Further, this lack of flexibility and cohesiveness becomes even more pronounced as the product ages during its shelf life. This has been found to be true, even when the product is made with relatively large amounts of plasticizing agents such as glycerin. Sugar sucrose based chewing gums, on the other hand, in stick form are relatively cohesive and flexible even after extended shelf life histories. Further, various of the prior art chewing gum products have very low moisture contents, i.e., of about 1 to 2t, and also have relatively low equivalent relative humidity ERM values, i.e., of the order of about 10 to 25.During the storage of such products under ambient conditions of about 40 to 70t relative humidity and about 20 to 300C, these low value RH properties of such products will cause such products to absorb relatively large amounts of water from the atmosphere. Such increased amounts of water will adversely affect various qualities of the product, and adversely affect the stability of any water decomposible components of such products. Thus, such products having very low ERH values would require that they be processed and wrapped under special atmospheric conditions of low humidity and controlled temperature. Such conditions are expensive and difficult to maintain. Equivalent relative humidity ERH or relative vapor pressure is the humidity at which a foodstuff neither gains nor loses moisture and the figure is expressed as a percentage. A discussion of ERH relative to food products and a method for the determination thereof is to be found in Chocolate, Cocoa and Confectionery, Science and Technology,Second Edition, 1980, Bernard M. Minifie, AVI Publishing Co.,Inc. Westport, Connecticut, U.S.A., Appendix I, pp. 672 677 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference . The test procedure disclosed in such publication is the one used for testing and evaluating the compositions disclosed herein. U.S. 4,248,895 discloses the preparation of a dried non hygroscopic free flowing powder that is made by drying a higher polyalcohol, such as hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, with a concentrated protein extract. The dried material has a moisture content of about 2 to 6 and may be used as a sweetener in confections such as chewing gum to provide products having prolonged shelf life in terms of retained flexibility and softness. The dried hydrogenated starch hydrolysate may also be used in combination with hydrogenated starch hydrolysate syrup having a moisture content of 15 to 40 . U. S. 4,382,962 discloses the preparation of sugarless chewing gum made with a specific aqueous hydrogenated starch hydrolysate that is designed to replace all or a portion of the mannitol previously used with other solid sweeteners, such as xylitol and or sorbitol, in such products. The hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is used as an aqueous softening agent. When used in a liquid filling in the chewing gum, the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate may have a moisture content of 15 to 20 column 4, lines 20 25 and column 9, lines 54 60 . When used in the sugarless chewing gum composition the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate has a moisture content of 17 to 30 , depending, basically, on the amount of the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate that is used column 8, lines 37 50 .The lower the amount of the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate that is to be used, the higher is the moisture content of such material. Commercially available aqueous hydrogenated starch hydrolysate which has a moisture content of about 20 to 35 has been proposed as a stabilizing agent for aspartame in chewing gum and other comestibles, see in this regard, U.S.patent applications S.N. 677,717 filed December 4, 1984 in the names of D.R. Friello et al., and entitled ComestibleContaining Moisture And Shelf Storage Stabilized L AsparticAcid Derivative and S.N. 677,716 filed December 4, 1984 in the names of D.R.

Prior to the present invention it has not been possible to provide, in stick form, regular sugarless gum which has the cohesive and flexible properties of good quality sugar based regular stick chewing gum. The present invention provides a sugarless stick chewing gum which is flexible during storage. According to the present invention, a cohesive, flexible sugarless chewing gum, in stick form, can be provided if the sugarless chewing gum is formulated with about 20 10 of aqueous hydrogenated starch hydrolysate which has been cooked to achieve a moisture content of about 8 4 . The cooked aqueous hydrogenated starch hydrolysate used in the compositions of the present invention has a moisture content of about 8 4 . This cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is prepared by cooking, or heating, commercially available aqueous solutions of the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate which have moisture contents of about 20 to 35 , at a temperature of about 250 to 3100F, and preferably of about 260 to 290OF, until the desired low moisture content of the cooked material is attained.This may take about 0.5 to 1 hour for a 100 gallon batch of a commercially available aqueous solution of hydrogenated starch hydrolysate having a moisture content of about The uncooked commercially available hydrogenated starch which may be used to form the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate used in the compositions of the present invention may be a hydrogenated corn syrup or hydrogenated starch hydrolysate of varying dextrose equivalents DE , such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent Re. No. 26,959 and U.S. Patent Nos. 3,556,811, 4,279,931 and 4,382,962, as well as various hydrogenated glucose syrups and or reconstituted powders which contain sorbitol, hydrogenated disaccharides, tri to hexa hydrogenated saccharides, and hydrogenated higher polysaccharides, or mixtures of any two or more of the above. The uncooked commercially available hydrogenated glucose syrups or hydrogenated starch hydrolysates and or powders thereof may be produced by catalytic hydrogenation of standard glucose syrups acid and or enzyme converted to the point where all the glucose end groups of the saccharides are reduced to alcohols , that is, dextrose to sorbitol. In the case of hydrogenated glucose syrups, the total solids contents will usually range from about 65 to about 80 , which solids are made from about 4 to about 70 , and preferably from about 4 to about 20E, sorbitol, from about 65 , hydrogenated disaccharides that is, mannitol , and 20 to 80 for the higher tri to hepta hydrogenated saccharides.The preferred of the uncooked commercially available hydrogenated starch hydrolysates contain from about 8 to about 45 , and preferably about 15 to 45F, tri to hepta hydrogenated sactharides, and from about 10 to about 35 , and preferably about 15 to 25 , hydrogenated saccharides higher than hepta. The commercially available hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is also referred to in the literature as hydrogenated glucose syrup, or by the trademark or tradenameLycasin polyol or Lonza polyol. The term hydrogenated starch hydrolysate will be used herein to designate such material.The hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is usually sold commercially in the form of an aqueous solution thereof having a moisture content of about 20 to 35 . The chewing gum compositions of the present invention are made with about 20 10 , and preferably about 15 5 of the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate. When less then about 10 of the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is used, the resulting products have poor flexibility properties, and when more than about 30 is used the resulting product is too soft. The chewing gum products of the present invention, have a moisture content of about 2 to 8 , and preferably of about 2 to 5 . The chewing gum products of the present invention may also comprise about 1 0 to 128 and preferably about 5 to 9t, of glycerine. The glycerine assists in providing long term storage flexibility, as well as initial softness of chew. The glycerin may be cooked with the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate and added as such to the chewing gum formulation, or it may be added separately. When the glycerine is cooked with the hydrogenated starch hydrolysate the cooking temperature should not exceed the decomposition temperature of the glycerin, which is about 2900C. The chewing gum products of the present invention have ERH values of 25 to 50, and preferably of about 30 to 50 and most preferably about 30 to 40. The cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate and or the glycerin may be added to the gum base portion, or with the non gum base components, when formulating the products of the present invention. The cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, with or without glycerin cooked therewith, is cooled to bellow about 150OF before being admixed with the other components of the chewing gum products of the present invention. When the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is prepared cooked with less than about 4 glycerine, the resulting product is in a glossy solid state at room temperature. When the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is made with about 4 to. 12 glycerine, the resulting product is a liquid or is pourable at room temperature. This solid glossy material melts, or becomes pourable, at a temperature of about 212 to 2200F. When using cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate in the chewing gum products of the present invention which has been made with less than about 4 glycerine, it is preferable, to facilitate the incorporation of the cooked material into the chewing gum composition, to use the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate just after it has been cooked, and it is still in a heated and liquid state. It is preferable under such circumstances to allow the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate made with less than 4 glycerine to cool down to about 150 to 160 OF before incorporating it into the chewing gum formulation. When the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate is made with about 4 to 12 glycerine, it is preferable to cool it down to about 100 to 1100F before it is added to the chewing gum formulation. The products of the present invention are made and used in stick form. The sticks are about 0.065 to 0.072 inch in thickness, about 3 4 inch in width, and about 2 7 8 to 3 inches in length. The term flexible as used herein means a characteristic denoted by testing individual sticks of gum in accordance with the following test procedure A single stick of gum, which is at room temperature, i.e., about 20 250C, is held between the thumb and index finger of both hands, along the wide sides of the stick, and within 0.5 to 1.0 inch of each end of the stick, and is then slowly twisted in opposite directions relative to the long axis of the wide side of the stick. A stick of gum made according to the present invention, which has good flexible properties, will bend or shape, without breaking or crumbling, after at least two or three 1800 turns of the fingers, into a helical shaped structure before tearing. A non flexible stick of gum, on the other hand, will typically break up or crumble after, or before, the completion of only one 1800 turn of the fingers. The flexibility properties of the stick chewing gum products made according to the present invention will last during prolonged storage of such products, i.e., for at least 9 to 12 months, when the products are stored at 40 to 70 relative humidity and at 20 to 300C. Although many prior art sugar less stick regular chewing gum products may pass the above described flexibility test when they are freshly made, and are warm, they will not do so after they have been cooled down to room temperature, i.e., 20 25 C. CHEWING GUM COMPOSITIONS The chewing gum compositions contemplated by the present invention comprise all types of sugarless chewing gums and chewing gum formulations known to those skilled in the art, including the regular gum and the bubble gum types.Typical chewing gum compositions comprise a chewing gum base, a modifier, a bulking agent or sweetener, and one or more other additives such as flavoring agents, colorants and antioxidants.

The mineral fillers would include calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, talc, alumina, tricalcium phosphate and mixtures thereof. In addition, the gum base may include antioxidants such as butylated hydroxy toluene, butylated hydroxy anisole and propyl gallate. The chewing gum compositions of the present invention are sugarless. The sugar substitutes used in the compositions of this invention include all known non nutritive sweeteners. The amount of non nutritive sweetener which can be used can range from 0 to about 2 weight percent of the final composition.

Various synthetic flavors, such as those for a mixed fruit, may also be incorporated in the chewing gum with or without conventional preservatives. GENERAL PREPARATION OF CHEWING GUM PRODUCT The chewing gum products of the present invention are prepared by first separately preparing the gum base. To then prepare the sugarless chewing gum formulation, the gum base for the product is melted, at a temperature about 190 to 250 OF, and the other components of the composition are added thereto. The resulting composition is uniformly admixed.Each of the components is usually separately added to the formulated composition and uniformly mixed in before the next component is added. All of the admixing operations are conducted at temperatures in the range of about 115 to 1850F, and preferably of about 115 to 1300C for a total mixing time, at such temperatures, of about 10 to 20 minutes. These operations do not have to be conducted under anhydrous conditions in preparing the compositions of the present invention, and any amounts of moisture that are normally present in the raw materials other than the uncooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate that are used in the compositions of the present invention do not usually have to be removed therefrom either prior to, or during, the formulating process.The one exception to this concept of not removing water occurs when using rubber latices as the source of the masticatory substance. As in prior art practice, the moisture content of the latex is, essentially, normally removed after coagulating the latex. The chewing gum formulations disclosed herein may thus be prepared, and processed into chewing gum products, using conventional chewing gum formulation mixing, processing and packaging equipment and concepts. The following examples are merely illustrative of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation upon the scope thereof PREPARATION OF CHEWING GUM COMPOSITIONS Various chewing gum compositions were prepared using various of the gum bases prepared as described above.In preparing the chewing gum compositions, they were prepared in pilot plant sized batches in paddle mixers. In preparing each batch, the previously prepared gum base is melted at a temperature of up to about 2450 50F and is premixed with lecithin and color additive, and, optionally, the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, and glycerine, if the latter is used, until the temperature drops to about 185 to 189OF. Then there is sequentially added powdered sorbitol at a temperature of 1800F , liquid flavor i.e., peppermint , liquid sorbitol, if used, glycerin, if used, alone or with the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, if the latter is not premixed with the gum base, any additional flavorants, and finally the aspartame, and, optionally, any other intense sweeteners. Each component is paddle mixed in before the next is added. Each mixing step takes about 0.5 to 5.0 minutes and the total mixing time is about 10 15 minutes.The resulting product is recovered and further processed and packaged using conventional chewing gum making procedures. The cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate used in the chewing gum compositions evaluated in the Examples had a moisture content of 7.5 or 11.5 and was prepared by cooking, at 250 to 3100F, a commercially available aqueous hydrogenated starch hydrolysate which had a solids content of 75 1 , a monosaccharide content of about 6 to 8 , a disaccharide content of about 50 to 55 , and a higher saccharide content of about 38 to 48 . The higher saccharides were about 20 to 25 in the 3 7 DP degree of polymerization range, and about 18 to 23 in the 7 DP range. Unless otherwise indicated, the total water content reported below for each of the chewing gum formulations of the Examples is a calculated amount based on the water content of the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate HSH , about 8 4 , and glycerin, about 1 to 4F, where used plus any added water used in the respective formulations. The actual water content of these formulations is about 0.2 to 0.5 higher than the reported calculated values, since such additional amounts of water enter the final formulated product from the other components of the formulation and from the ambient atmosphere. The total of the reported weight percents for the respective formulations of these Examples will thus total about 100 plus the respectively reported calculated water contents. The test formulations were prepared using batch pilot plant procedures. Prior to beginning the pilot plant batch making process, a batch of cooked HSH glycerine was prepared, and then split into two half batches each of which contains one half of each of the formulated amounts of the glycerine and the cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate that are to be used in making the product of each example. One of such premixtures is then used in each of steps 3 and 6 noted below. Step Wise Pilot Plant Procedure 1. Into a pre warmed sigma bladed mixer add molten gum base. The gum base temperature should be between 150 2000F, and preferably between 170 1900F. 2. With the blades of the mixer operating, and the temperature in the cited range, the lecithin is added and the mixing is continued for one minute. 3. Add one half of the cooked HSH glycerine premixture, or the first 1 2 of the HSH, and mix for two minutes, or until homogeneous. 4. Add 1 2 of the sorbitol powder and continue mixing for two minutes. 5. The liquid flavor is then added and mixing is continued for one minute. 6. Add the second half of the cooked HSH glycerine premixture, or the second 1 2 of the cooked HSH, and mix for two minutes. 7. Add the remaining sorbitol powder and the non nutritive sweetener. Prior to production of the batch, the non nutritive sweetener is premixed with a small portion of the sorbitol powder. Continue mixing for two minutes, or until the batch is homogeneous. The final gum temperature is approximately 112OF. 8. The gum is removed from the mixer and conditioned at 700F 42 55 R.H prior to forming. 9. The gum is rolled and scored into a stick configuration. Mannitol is applied to the surface of the scored gum to prevent surface adhesion. The gum is then packaged in fin seal foil pouches and sealed. Examples 1 and 2 Using the pilot plant procedure described above two 2 chewing gum products were prepared from the following formulations, in by weight. Weight of ComponentComponent Example 1 2Styrene butadiene 30 30 copolymer based gum base sorbitol, powder 43 40 cooked hydrogenated 20 20 starch hydrolysate glycerine 5 8 flavor 1 1 lecithin 1 1 aspartame 0.2 0.2 moisture Ca. 3 Ca. 2.2 100 100Ca. aboutThe cooked hydrogenated starch hydrolysate used in Examples 1 and 2 had a moisture content of, respectively, 11.5 and 7.5 . The chewing gum products of the present invention were flexible. When tested for flexibility, as described above, individual sticks of gum made from each of theExample 1 and 2 products were twisted 3 times before breaking. These tests for flexibility were conducted, periodically, over a storage period of up to about 55 days under accelerated aging conditions of 100 105 and about 30 relative humidity. The packaged chewing gum products of the present invention made in Examples 1 and 2 were also evaluated for the shelf life stability of the aspartame used therein while stored for up to about 40 to 55 days under accelerated aging conditions at 100 1050F and ambient, about 300, relative humidity, with the following results TABLE 1 APM Recovery During Accelerated Aging Storage of Examples 1 and 2 Chewing Gum Samples days storage 0 14 21 28 35 41 56 APM Recovery Example 1 93 NT 86.5 79.5 Example 2 96 94.5 NT 81.5 80 74 NT Not tested at this time interval. The APM was analyzed for, employing standard gas chromatography procedures, first at zero time, i.e., within 48 hours after the product was first made and prior to its being subjected to any accelerated aging, and then at various intervals, as noted in Table I above, after 14 to 56 days of accelerated aging time. Based on experience each day of accelerated aging time is equivalent to about 7 to 7.5 days of commercial storage aging time. Thus, 40 days of accelerated aging time is equivalent to about 280 to 300 days, or about 10 months, of commercial storage time, and 50 days of accelerated aging time is equivalent to about 350 to 375 days, or at least one year, of commercial storage time.These test results thus indicate that the aspartame is very stable in the compositions of the present invention in that at least about 80 of the APM is retained and recoverable for at least 40 days of accelerated aging and at least 70 of the aspartame is retained and recoverable for at least 55 days of accelerated aging time. The aspartame need not be encapsulated or coated in any way when employed in the products of the present invention. It and the other components of the chewing gum products in which it is used may all be freely dispersed in such products. Examples 3 to 8 A series of six sugarless stick chewing gum products were evaluated for ERH values and flexibility values. The compositions of these products are indicated below, or in Table 2. Products 3 and 4 were made according to the present invention, as described above, using either a styrene butadiene based gum base Gum Base A or a gum base made from an admixture of styrene butadiene elastomer and polyisobutylene elastomer Gum Base B . Products 5 and 6 were made with Gum Base A and were based on prior art composition technology high glycerine, low moisture content . Products 5 and 6 were otherwise prepared as described above. Product 7 is an off the shelf sample ofTrident spearmint gum manufactured by Warner Lambert Co.Product 8 was an off the shelf sample of Extra bubble gum manufactured by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. Trident and Extra are trademarks of such companies . The list of contents of the Extra product, as indicated on the label thereof, is sorbitol, gum base, mannitol, glycerol, artificial and natural flavors, lecithin, aspartame, artificial colors and butylated hydroxy toluene. The list of contents of the Trident product, as indicated on the label thereof, is sorbitol, gum base, glycerine, mannitol, softeners, natural and artificial flavors, and sodium saccharin. The compositions of the Trident and Extra products thus do not contain hydrogenated starch hydrolysate in any form. It is believed that the Trident product contains about 2 water and that the Extra product contains about 1 water. The exact formulated contents of these products is not known. The products were each analyzed for their ERH value, as described above. The ERH values of these products are shown below in Table 2.
