# Microwave switch.

## Abstract
An improved microwave switch incorporating a fin line structure 7,8 is described. Microwave switches incorporat ing fin line structures enable microwave energy to be passed to a load or reflected back to the source, by controlling the conductance state of diodes 14,15 mounted on the fin line structure. The present invention enables the electrical per formance of such switches to be greatly improved. The height of a waveguide channel in the vicinity of the fin line structure is very greatly reduced thereby forcing a wave guide mode of propagation into a slot line so that the fin line structure receives substantially all of the energy supplied to the switch. Higher order modes which are generated at the fin line structure are attenuated by lossy material 33,34 positioned in choke cavities 20,21 mounted on either side of the fin line structure.

## Description
Microwave Switch This invention relates to a microwave switch which is suitable for controlling microwave energy in a waveguide system. It is particularly difficult to fabricate a microwave switch which is compatible with waveguide structures as this generally requires the provision of high precision moving parts. As an alternative, it has been proposed to utilise a fin line structure, as it is possible to electrically control the conductivity of such a structure without the need to provide mechanically movable parts. Switchable diodes can be used to short circuit opposing edges of a fin line structure, when it is required to render the switch non conductive. Fin line structures are described in, for example, Integrated FinLine Millimeter Components by P. J. Meier, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. MTT 22, No. 12,Dec. 74.Microwave switches which incorporate fin line structures have not been capable of providing a very high level of electrical performance and in particular in the off state, i.e. when the switch is nominally non conductive, the impendance which it presents to an applied microwave signal is not sufficiently high for many purposes, as this can have the effect of allowing a relatively low level electrical signal to reach a load. Even though the level of this leakage signal is low, it is very undesirable and quite unacceptable for certain applications. The present invention seeks to provide an improved microwave switch in which this drawback is reduced. According to this invention, a microwave switch for controlling the passage of microwave energy includes a waveguide channel dimensioned to support a predetermined waveguide mode of propagation of the microwave energy applied to it a fin line structure, dimensioned to support a slot line mode of propagation, comprising a pair of co planar conductive plates mounted across the waveguide channel and lying in the E plane, the two plates being spaced apart by a small distance switchable means arranged to control the conductivity of the fin line structure and means for locally modifying the waveguide channel in the vicinity of the fin line structure so as to render it incapable of support ing said predetermined waveguide mode so that the microwave energy is diverted to said fin line structure. Preferably the means for locally modifying the waveguide channel comprises a portion of the waveguide channel in which its height, in a direction perpendicular to the E plane direction, is very much reduced in the region of the fin line structure. This can be achieved by locally deforming the outer wall of the waveguide channel or alternatively by inserting into the channel a suitably shaped conductive plate or block. The presence of the means for locally modifying the waveguide channel prevents propagation of the fundamental waveguide mode and ensures that the applied microwave energy is diverted to the fin line structure so that it can be controlled by the switchable means by the switching arrangement. Harmonic waveguide modes of propagation may be cenerated to a certain extent, although their amplitude as compared with that of the fundamental mode is very small as in a conventional switch utilising a fin line structure. The means for locally modifying the waveguide channel also suppresses these harmonic modes. To further improve the attenuation of the harmonic modes, an absorbtive lossy material is mounted in cavities positioned in the vicinity of the fin line structure. The switchable means can comprise one or more switchable diodes mounted to bridge the two plates ef the fin line structure these can be termed shunt mounted diodes. At relatively lc4 microwave frequencies, microwave energy passes through the switch whilst the diode or diodes is non conductive, whereas it is reflected back to the input port whilst the diode is held in its conductive state.Because all diodes possess inductance, the effect can be reversed at higher frequencies that is to say, the switch is conductive whilst the diode is conductive and vice versa. Thus the switchable means has to be designed with the operating frequencies of the switch in mind. Instead of using shunt mounted diodes, it is possible to mount one or more diodes to bridge discontinuities in one or both of the two plates which comprise the fin line structure.Such an arrangement of diodes is termed series mounted diodes. The microwave switch can be used to route energy to different ones of a plurality of input or output ports, as opposed to operating as a simple on off switch. The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which, Figures 1 and 2 show sectional and perspective views respectively of a known microwave switch, and Figure 3 shows a perspective view of a microwave switch in accordance with this invention, and Figure 4 shows an alternative kind of switch. Referring to Figure 1, which shows a sectional view, andFigure 2 which is an exploded perspective view, a microwave switch comprises two large blocks of conductive material 2 and 3 which are arranged to sandwich between them a fin line structure 4. Thin sheets of dielectric material 24, 25 are positioned on either side of the fin line structure 4, so as to electrically insulate it from the two blocks 2 and 3. In use, microwave energy is applied to an input port 5 of a microwave channel 6, which is dimensioned so as to support a predetermined waveguide mode of propagation. In this connection the term microwave includes millimetric frequencies. The fin line structure 4 consists of two coplanar plates 7 and 8 mounted in theE plane direction of the waveguide channel 6.For convenience the plates 7 and 8 are supported by the larger dielectric sheet 24. In some cases it may be more convenient to form the plates 7 and 8 respectively as thin conductive foils on opposite sides of a single thin insulating film of dielectric material as the film is very thin, the two plates are still effectively coolanar. The fin line has the effect of converting the waveguide mode of propagation to a slot line mode of propagation, and the two plates 7 and 8 are provided with edges surfaces 9 and 10 of a tapering profile adjacent to the input port 5 so as to avoid abrupt transitions occurring in the propagation of the microwave energy.Thus the microwave energy travels over the central portion of the fin line structure in a slot line mode, and is then progressively converted back to a waveguide mode of propagation by a furter pair of tapering edges 11 and 12, so that the original waveguide mode of propagation is made available at an output port 13 of the waveguide channel 6. wo diodes 14 and 15 are mounted so as to ele rically bridge the two plates 7 and 8, and bias circuits 16 and 17 which may include suitable filters are arranged so as to permit the two diodes to be either biassed into conduction or non conduction depending on the polarity and magnitude of bias voltages applied at contacts 18 and 19. If the two diodes 14 and 15 are held non conductive, the microwave energy applied at input port 5 travels through the switch to a load not shown via port 6 with very little attenuation.However, if the two diodes are rendered conductive, the microwave energy is reflected back to its source and very little energy reaches the load. Additional diodes can be provided to enhance te switching action if needed. To minimise the oss of microwave energy whilst the switch is in its conductive state, two r.f. choke circuits in the form of cavities D and 21 are provided. The thickness of the wall nTz is made equal to 4 where 1 is the wavelength of the applied signal. These cavities operate to ensure the existence of an efective radio frequency short circuit between the fin line structure itself and the adjacent waveguide walls. Unfortunately, although these chokes are essential, their presence enables many more modes of propagation to exist. In particular, harmonic modes of propagation can now b pass the fin line structure and reach a load even whilst the switch is nominally in its non conductive state. These leakage levels of microwave energy can be very safl indeed, but are still unacceptable for certain applications. A microwave switch which is modified in accordance with this invention is illustrated in Figure 3, and it permits the per fort ance level to be substantially enhanced to levels which enable very strinqent performance requirements to be met. Referring to Figure 3, the reference numerals of Figures 1 and 2 are used to identify like parts. The main point of difference shown in Figure 3 comprises two side wall blocks 30 mounted adjacent to the fin line structure part of the cavity wall is cut away so that one block 30 can be seen, but the other block, which is mounted within the block 3, is not visible . Each block has a height which is somewhat less than the corresponding depth of the waveguide channel so that the tops of the blocks do not contact the fin line structure itself. Each end of each block 30 is tapered as shown, to give a more gradual transition to and from the slot line mode.Although in this example, both blocks 30 are electrically connected to the walls of the channels 6, they can be electrically insulated from it. Both blocks 30, are however, formed of a material having a good electrical conductivity.The presence of these blocks prevents propagation of the waveguide mode along the waveguide channel, and forces the microwave energy wholly into a slot line mode, so that it is conducted along the fin line structure. In this way virtually all of the energy applied to the switch is controlled by the action of the diodes 14 and 15. Even so, some of the harmonic modes continue to exist and these can by pass the fin line structure by passing along the choke cavil ires 20 and 21. Lossy absorbent material 33 and 34 is positioned in each choke cavity to absorb this energy and to prevent the excitation of harmonic modes of any appreciable energy. Similar blocks, not shown, are mounted in the waveguide structure 3 in an exactly analogous manner.Any suitable lossy material can be used, such as MarconiAbsorber type Y33 1980. The effect of the side wall blocks 30 and the lossy material is to very greatly enhance the performance of the switch. Although the conductivity of the switch in its on state remains very high, its effective transmissive impedance in the off state becomes very high indeed, and reduces energy leakage to a load of harmonic modes to an extremely low level. A three port switch is show. in Figure 4. It has one input port 32, and two output ports 33 and 34. The general pri. ciDle of operation is very similar to that of the switch shown in Figure 3, but three waveguide channels 35, 36, 37 .meet at a point where a side wall block 38 is positioned. In Figure 4, only the bottom half of the switch structure is shown, and in practice an additional block is placed above that of the block 38, with a fin line structure between them.As before1 the block 38 has tapered ends 39, 40, 41. The fin line structure is shown in broken line it consists of three plates 42, 43, 44, with the plates being bridged by switchable diodes 45, 46 placed in the two channels 36, 7 leading to the output ports 33, 34. By controlling ti state of the diodes, microwave energy can be routed to either output tort, or even shared between them. Absorbtive lossy material 47, 48, 49 is positioned in cavities 50, 51, 52 adjacent to the fin line structure, in a manner analogous to that ofFigure 3.
