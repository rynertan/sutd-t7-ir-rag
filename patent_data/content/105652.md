# Improvements in and relating to the edge bonding of sheet material.

## Abstract
When a packaging container is formed by sealing an area of sheet material to the edge of another area of sheet material, the L joint or T joint so formed is sometimes liable to rupture when subjected to blows or strain. According to this invention that danger is reduced or eliminated by moulding a zone 4 of an end closure panel 3 abutting on the container wall edge to which it is jointed so that it forms a flange resting against and bonded to the face of said wall 1 . The flange may be provided with a lip projecting from a short length 6 of the edge of said closure panel 3 .
