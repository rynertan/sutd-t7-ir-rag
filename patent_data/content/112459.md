# Production of butanol by a continuous fermentation process.

## Abstract
An improved process for the continuous production of butanol by fermentation of carbohydrates with C. acetobuty licum is disclosed. This process combines continuous ino culum production at a high dilution rate and cycling the fermentation broth through a material which adsorbs buta nol whereby a vigorous cell population is maintained in the fermentation reactor for extended periods of time.
