# Rotary sleeve bearing apparatus for rotary compressors.

## Abstract
An air bearing apparatus for use in a movable vane compressor of the type having a rotary sleeve 30 mounted in the center housing 22 for rotation with a plurality of vanes 16 , said apparatus comprising an air bearing room 40 defined between the inner periphery of the center hous ing and the outer periphery of the rotary sleeve to floatingly support the rotary sleeve and an air supply passage 45 to supply air to the air bearing room from the compression working space. In order to increase the bearing performance of the air bearing room when the compressor runs at high speeds in which the amount of air to be supplied to the air bearing room exceeds what can be extracted from the compression working space, the apparatus is provided with an auxiliary passage 47 extending from the discharge chamber 41 to the air supply passage through a cheque valve 76 to supply air to the air bearing room from the discharge chamber.
