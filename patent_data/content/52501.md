# Improved sealed off RF excited CO2 lasers and method of manufacturing such lasers.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for manufacturing a sealed off RF excited CO₂ laser with a longer operating life. The invention, which relates to the method and the resulting laser, compri ses means for stabilizing the laser gas chemistry otherwise affected by CO₂ dissociation, O₂ consumption, and outgas sing of H₂ and H₂O. More specifically, the aluminum housing of the laser assembly is nickel plated and then passivated by an oxidation technique using concentrated nitric acid. In addition, novel gettering substances, comprising either a group B metal or cellulose, are employed to adsorb hyd rogen and or water vapor to alleviate the outgassing problem.
