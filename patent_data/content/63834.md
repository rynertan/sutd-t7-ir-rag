# Heat exchanger for liquid liquid heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger for liquid liquid heat exchange has a plurality of parallel vertical tubes 1 arranged for the upward transport within the tubes 1 of a first heat exchange liquid, supply and discharge tanks 4, 5 for the first liquid into which the lower and upper ends of the tubes 1 respectively open. A granular mass is fluidized during operation by the flow of the first liquid so as to occupy at least the tubes 1 . Supply and dis charge means 10, 14 for a second heat exchange liquid bring the second liquid into contact with the outer surface of the tubes 1 . In order to improve the heat flow between the second liquid and the tubes 1 , the supply means 10 for the second liquid causes the second liquid to contact the tubes 1 in the form of a film 13 flowing downwardly along the outer surface of each tube 1 .
