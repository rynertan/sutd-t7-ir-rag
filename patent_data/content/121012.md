## Description
ORAL COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to compositions for the care of the oral cavity. The efficacy of fluorine in the prevention of dental caries is well established see for exampleUS Patents 3 029 191, 3 070 510 and 3 227 617 . The acceptance of fluoride ions as an anticariogenic agent is based essentially on the observation that among the many topical agents that have been tested in clinical trials only those that contain fluorine have been effective in reducing caries. Fluorine free salts tested have not prevented caries formation. It is also known that zinc salts inhibit the growth of dental plaque see US Patents Nos. 4 022 880, 4 082 841, 4 100 269, 4 152 819 and 4 154 815 . The present invention relates to oral compositions comprising an active compound effective both as an anti caries agent and as an anti plaque agent. According to the invention there is provided an oral composition having anti caries and anti plaque activity comprising 0.01 to 3 by weight of zinc ammonium fluoride ZnNH4F3 The synthesis of ZnNH F is described inJ.Am.Chem.Soc. 80, 2662, 1958. In the preparation of therapeutic or prophylactic oral compositions incorporating ZnNH4F3, a suitable carrier or oral media well known in the art is used.Adjuvants such as colouring agents, flavours, humectants, abrasives, detergents, preservatives, emollients and the like and other therapeutic agents compatible withZnNH4F3 may also be included. The oral composition is preferably in the form of a toothpaste or mouthwash. A particularly suitable amount of the ZnNH4F3 is such as to provide from 1000 to 1500 ppm of fluoride ion. However, the amount may conveniently range from 100 to 3000 ppm. The following Experiments and Examples illustrate the invention. Percentages are by weight. The ZnNH4F3 employed in the following experiments was synthesised according to the method ofHaendler and Johnson J.Am.Chem.Sec. 80, 2662, 1958 .The analytical details were as follows Theoretical Analytical Zn 46.58 46.90 NH4 12.83 12.26 F 40.59 40.96 Cariogenic Bacteria used for testing the effect ofZnNH F were Streptococcus mutans strains coded 6715 and OMZ 176 , Streptococcus sanguis strains coded 10556 and 10557 , Streptococcus salivarius strains coded SS4 andH257 , and Lactobacillus casei. All of the above organisms were maintained as lyophilised cultures until the time for use. An aqueous solution of ZnNH4F3 has a pH of 5.8.The preferred pH of oral compositions containingZnNH4F3 is from 4.5 to 8.0. A 1000 ppm F solution was stable. It did not become hazy on standing after several weeks. In contrast, a SnF2 solution developed turbidity, probably due to dxy fluoride formation, after 24 hours at room temperature. At normal temperature and pressure ZnNHqF3 is more soluble about 2.7 than ZnF2 1.5 . Solutions of ZnNH F exhibited 100 availability of F ion at 1000 and 2500 ppm F levels the ionised fluoride was determined by the Orion SelectiveFluoride electrode Model 96 09 . ZnNH F was much less astringent and metallic tasting than the corresponding uncomplexed fluoride salts at equal molar concentrations. More particularly, ZnNH 4F3 was considerably less astringent than the following ranked in descending order of astringency zinc phenolsulphonate, ZnSO4 and ZnF2 at 0.lem concentration which would be equivalent to approximately 6000 ppm F levels. These results were the unanimous decisions of a blind study consisting of a tasting panel of three judges. ZnNH4F3 at 1000 ppm F levels had no effect on the transparency or taste of oral compositions. It is generally agreed that oral bacteria are responsible for tooth decay. Therefore, a reduction of the cariogenic flora usually results in a decrease in caries formation. The inhibitory action of the test compounds was determined by adding each salt, at known concentrations, to a culture of cariogenic bacteria. After 24 hours at 370C bacterial growth was monitored as a change in optical density. A dose response curve concentration of salt vs.growth for each compound against each bacterial isolate was plotted in order to obtain the concentration of test agent which would cause a 50 inhibition in growth ID 50 . This is a useful ranking index since it is not always possible to obtain complete inhibition with weak germicidal agents. Only those compounds which were able to elicit an ID 50 response were considered as inhibitory agents. The medium used for bacterial growth experiments was Trypticase Soy Broth B.B.L. Baltimore Biological Labs., Baltimore, MD supplemented with 0.1 Tween 80 the word Tween is a trade mark and 0.05 sodium thioglycollate. The test organisms, as lyophilised cells, were grown overnight in 50 mls of growth medium in a vacuum desiccator with an atmosphere of 97 CO2 3 H2 at 350C.These cultures were then used at a 0.2 inoculum to prepare second stage seed flasks. The test media 10ml consisting of growth medium plus the potential inhibitors, contained in 16 x 120 mm screw top test tubes, were inoculated with the second stage seed cultures to give an absorbancy reading of 0.05. Immediately after inoculation the cultures were incubated for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. The growth medium was sterilised by autoclaving, whereas the potential inhibitors as aqueous solutions were sterilised by filtering each solution separately through a Millipore membrane 0.22 u . Absorbance at 600 nm versus a medium control was used as a measure of growth on a Beckman Model B spectrophotometer. All absorbancy readings were determined in 16 mm x 120 mm Kimax test tubes. This instrument was linear to 0.60 optical density units thus, all cultures displaying values above this range were diluted with the control, accordingly.

Due to a limited amount of ZnNH4C13, half the organisms were excluded from evaluation using this material. The results show that ZnNH F was more inhibitory than the non fluoride salts and NaF, with no apparent changes in specificities. The ID 50 values, recalculated as ppm F, again show Table II that ZnNH4F3 is more active than NaF. TABLE II INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL GROWTH BY FLUORINE SALTS ID 50 ppm F S.mutans S.salivarius S.sanguis L.casei 6715 OMZ 176 SS4 H 257 10556 10557 Salts NaF 138 309 255 72 22 35 352 ZnNH F 92 174 104 19 12 14 268 43 One of the mechanisms whereby fluorine decreases caries formation is that the fluorine reduces the acid solubility of dental enamel. This trait has been demonstrated repeatedly by in vitro dissolution tests. It is well established that the fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite of tooth enamel to form principally CaF2 and fluoroapatite.The relative importance of the two products is still questionable but fluoroapatite is more desirable. Nevertheless, in either case the altered tooth s surface is less susceptible to demineralisation from acids produced by oral bacteria than the unmodified enamel. The cation of the fluoride salt can also react with dental enamel to yield the corresponding insoluble phosphates which in turn may reduce enamel solubility. It was, therefore, a purpose of the following study to determine the efficacy of ZnNH F in reducing hydroxyapatite solubility. The ammoniated salt was compared with SnF2, NaF and Na2FPO3 using a dissolution system employing hydroxyapatite discs described by Forward Caries Research 11 9 15, 1977 . Demineralisation of a hydroxyapatite disc was determined by measuring the amount of phosphate released from a given area 123mm2 of the disc after a standard exposure time to a buffered solution of the test agent in the following manner. Hydroxyapatite discs of uniform size 13 mm diameter were prepared by cold vacuum compression of a mixture of column chromatography hydroxyapatite powder Bio Gel HTP, Bio Rad Labs, Richmond, CA and polyethylene powder. Each disc was embedded in a block of paraffin 19 mm square exposing only one face. The block was then mounted on a plastic rod which was placed in the chuck of a motor. The mounted discs were hydrated in distilled water for 1 min., avoiding air bubble formation on the disc s surface by slowly rotating the paraffin block. Upon removal, excess water was removed from the disc with a paper tissue.The hydrated discs were subsequently submerged into the buffered test solution for 1 min., followed by a water rinse of 10 ml and a 1 min. immersion in 50 ml of distilled water. The disc was again blotted lightly with a tissue and at this point was ready for dissolution. The block disc preparation was immersed depth 7.6 cm in 100 ml of 1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.65 contained in a plastic jar. Dissolution experiments were performed at 370C by rotating the mounted discs at 350 rpm 10 rpm for 30 minutes. After this time the extent of reaction of the test compound with the hydroxyapatite disc was determined by analysing the acetate buffer for phosphate using the method of Chen et al Anal.Chem. 28 1756 1758, 1956 . Percent reduction in dissolution was the difference in phosphate levels between a disc treated with buffered test agents and a control disc treated with buffer alone. Table III shows the relative demineralisation occurring when hydroxyapatite is exposed to buffered solutions of the representative fluorides. It can be seen that the degree of demineralisation caused by 1000 ppm fluoride solutions varies with each fluoride salt and the pH of the solution, but in every case dissolution was reduced, particularly at the lower pH values. This is consistent with past evidence that acidic conditions increase the rate of formation of CaF2 and fluoroapatite.The results also indicate that the Sn and ZnNH4 salts are similar in activity and both are considerably more effective in reducing demineralisation than NaF andNa2FPO3 at all pH values. These data indicate that the presence of ZnNH4 cations enhance the anti cariogenic effects of fluoride.

Dental plaque is a film on the surface of teeth.This layer is the result of bacterial growth and is composed chiefly of microorganisms, proteinaceous materials and microbial by products, such as glucans and organic acids. Plaque is not only primarily responsible for caries formation but it is also implicated in gingival diseases. Because the results described herein above have demonstrated that ZnNH4F3 possesses antibacterial activity, it is obvious that ZnNH F will also reduce plaque formation. The in vitro test used to compare the antiplaque effects of ZnNH F vs ZnSO4 is now described. The in vitro plaque was initiated on uniformly sized aluminium plummets which were previously coated for 20 min. with wax stimulated whole saliva. These coated plummets were then placed in a Trypticase B.B.L. 1 sucrose growth medium inoculated with clinical plaque samples. After 5 hours of incubation at 370C the plummets were immersed in a solution containing equal volumes of whole saliva and the test compound for one minute and subsequently suspended overnight 370C in a 20 solution of saliva supernatant. On the second day the plummets were retreated with the test solution 1 min. and reincubated in inoculated Trypticase sucrose growth medium for 5 hours. After this period of time the plaques were rinsed in distilled water for 5 minutes. The plaques were then removed from the plummets by sonication in 10 ml distilled water and quantitated in a Unicam SP 500 spectrophotometer at 570 nm. A test compound showed antiplaque activity if the plaque mass optical density reading was less than the control plaques treated with water. Five replicas per test compound were examined. Table IV clearly indicates that ZnNH F is an effective antiplaque agent. ZnSO4 was used as a standard soluble zinc salt and the results obtained are consistent with the bacterial theory of plaque formation.

The fluoride concentration from ZnNHqF3 at these test levels does not affect plaque formation Skjorland, Gjermo Rolla, Scand, J. Dent Res. 86 103 117, 1978 . There was no difference in activity betweenZnSO4 and ZnNH4F3 and this is consistent with the fact that the zinc is freely available due to the rather weak complexing between the Zn and NH4 log K 2.18 2.59 . An animal study was conducted to establish the effect of ZnNH F on the incidence of caries. The animal study was conducted as follows. Osborne Mendel rats were interbred in a closed colony on site and the animals mated randomly. The breeding animals were maintained on a mixed cereal corn, wheat, soybean fish and bone meal diet prior to mating. Rats were weaned generally between 22 24 days so that experiments could start at a predetermined date. The animals from one litter were randomly assigned one, or preferably two, to each of the various treatments and the total number of animals per treatment was sixteen. Each animal was weighed, numbered and caged separately in a stainless steel wire cage which restricts coprophagy.The animals were then maintained on a cariogenic diet sugar 66 , skin milk 32 , liver powder 28 and fed sterile distilled water.The test solution was applied topically with a fine sable haired brush to each rat s molar teeth for 15 sec. twice daily for the first 2 weeks and once daily for the third week. After 21 days the animals were sacrificed with chloroform and weighed. The two separate mandible and the complete upper jaw were then excised and the mandibles defleshed by means of a scalpel and dental chisel after immersion in neutralised formal saline for 48 hours. The molar teeth were mounted, sectioned longitudinally, and stained with Schiff s reagent and scored by the method ofKonig et al, Dtsch. Zahn , Mund. and Kieferheilk 29 99 127 1958 . Using a 40X magnification the lesion in each fissure was rated for severity on a four point scale, of ATBC.Scoring lesion severity was as follows A Pink colouration in enamel within the fissure T Pink colouration at the enamel dentine junction but without loss of dentinal material B Colouration and loss of material at the enamel dentine junction C Loss of enamel material from within the fissure. At the conclusion of the experiment the number of lesions and severity score for each treatment group was averaged and the percent reduction in caries based on the water control was calculated. The dental caries data are presented in Table V.Only the severe lesions B C were scored in this experiment since the object of the study was to determine whether a significant difference in performance existed between fluoride compounds. Numerically all of the experimental groups demonstrated a reduction in caries which were statistically significant from the controls however, there was no significant difference in activity between the fluoride salts. While the results achieved with ZnNH F were not different from the reductions obtained with NaF and NaMFP sodium monofluorophosphate,Na2PO3F , they nonetheless demonstrate that significant dental caries reduction can be achieved with ZnNH4F3.
