# MOVING TARGET INDICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
In order that it should respond satisfactorily to substan tially all moving targets within range without exhibiting blind speeds and ignore all stationary targets, a moving target indication system comprises an FM continuous wave radar system in the form of an oscillator 1 the output frequency of which is swept by the output signal of a triangular wave generator 19 . The oscillator output signal is fed to an aerial 3 via a circulator 4 and also to a first input 6 of a mixer 7 a second input 8 of which is supplied with the return signal from the aerial. The respective output waveforms of the mixer occurring for sweeps of the oscillator frequency in the two senses, are, in a further circuit 11 , subtracted one from the other after effectively time reversing one of them, and the resulting difference wave form is analysed in a Fast Fourier Transform calculating circuit 15 . The triangular wave generator 19 may be replaced by a sawtooth wave generator, in which case the effective time reversal in the further circuit 11 should be omitted.
