# CONVEYOR ROLLERS AND CONVEYORS INCORPORATING SUCH ROLLERS

## Abstract
A conveyor roller for a gravity rollerway conveyor has a resilient tyre and a low friction bearing. Resilient tyres 13 are selected for various properties desired for the overall conveyor and are permanently preassembled on metallic cylindrical tubes 12 for stockpiling, so that thereafter they may be selected for a particular job and each mechanically force fitted onto the outer race of a standard wheel subassembly 5 that includes a bearing. In this manner, the secure assembly of the tyre can be accomplished without contaminating or deteriorating the bearing or other parts of the wheel subassembly 5 .
