# Electrical timing control switch.

## Abstract
An electrical timing circuit for controlling the activation and deactivation of an electrical load by setting a predeter mined time period for which the load will be on and for providing one or more short warning periods wherein the load is deactivated prior to the expiration of the predeter mined time period. The invention may be used as a switch for a light whereby the light may be actuated to remain on for an hour, but just prior to the expiration of hour period the light will momentarily go off for one or more warning periods prior to the light being turned completely off so that the switch may be reactuated to start another timing period. Momentary switches 12 control a set reset circuit 16 which sends a signal to a NAND gate 18 . A timing circuit 20 is responsive to the momentary switches 12 to provide a plurality of time spaced signals. A first gate means 22 responds to the timing circuit 20 to provide an input to the summing gate 18 to effectively turn the load off, but only for short warning periods. A second gate means 24 is responsive to both the first gate means 22 and the timing circuit 20 to provide an input to the set reset circuit 16 to effectively turn the load off at the end of the predetermined period.
