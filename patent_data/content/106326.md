## Description
1 AMINO OR NITRO 3, 5 DISUBSTITUTED 4 ETHOXYBENZENES AND THEIR PRODUCTION The present invention relates to l amino or nitro 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxybenzenes and their production. The said l amino or nitro 3,5 disubstituted 4ethoxybenzenes are representable by the formula EMI1.1 wherein X is a chlorine atom or a methyl group, Y is a methyl group, a methoxymethyl group or an ethoxy group and Z is an amino group or a nitro group. The 1 amino or nitro 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxybenzenes I cover 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxyanilines I Z NH2 and 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxynitrobenzenes I Z NO2 . They are useful as intermediates in the production of isopropyl N 3 ,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxyphenyl carbamates of the formula EMI1.2 wherein X and Y are each as defined above, which are known to be per se useful as fungicides against phytopathogenic fungi, particularly those resistant.to benzimidazole fungicides and thiophanate fungicides. For instance, the reaction of 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxyanilines I Z NH2 with isopropyl chloroformate affords the corresponding isopropyl N 3, 5 disubstituted 4 ethoxyphenyl carbamates II . The 3, 5 disubstituted 4 ethoxynitrobenzene I Z NO2 can be produced by reacting the corresponding 3,5disubstituted 4 nitrophenol of the formula EMI2.1 wherein X and Y are each as defined above, which is obtainable by the procedure as descirbed in J.Org.Chem., 27, 218 1962 , with an ethylating agent, usually in an inert solvent in the presence of a base at a temperature of 0 to 1500C for a period of not more than 10 hours. Examples of the ethylating agent are ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, dimethyl sulfate, etc. Examples of the inert solvent are hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane , ethers e.g. diisopropyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran , alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol , esters e.g. ethyl acetate, butyl acetate , N,N dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, sulforane, water, etc. Mixtures of two or more solvents as exemplified above are also usable. As the base, there may be used sodium hydride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide, etc. Treatment of the reaction mixture by a per se conventional separation procedure such as distillation, recrystallization and chromatography gives the desired 3, 5 disubstituted 4 ethoxynitrobenzene I Z NO2 . Reduction of the 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxynitrobenzene I Z NO2 by any procedure as conventionally adopted for conversion of a nitro group on the benzene ring into an amino group affords the corresponding 3,5 disubstituted 4 ethoxyaniline I Z NH2 . As the reduction procedure, there may be adopted, for instance, reduction with sodium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide, reduction with a metal or catalytic reduction.When the reduction with sodium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide is adopted, treatment of the nitrobenzene with the said reagent is usually carried out in a mixture of water and an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol at a temperature of room temperature to 1000C for a period of not more than 12 hours. The reduction with a metal is normally accomplished by treatment of the nitrobenzene with a metal e.g. iron, tin, zinc in the presence of an acid such as an inorganic acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or an organic acid e.g. acetic acid or its mixture with water at a temperature of room temperature to 1000C for a period of not more than 12 hours.In case of the catalytic reduction, the nitrobenzene is ordinarily treated with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst e.g. Raney nickel, palladium, platinum dioxide, palladium carbon, platinum black in an inert solvent such as an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol , an ether e.g. diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or an ester e.g. ethyl acetate, butyl acetate under a pressure of atmospheric pressure to 100 atm. at a temperature of room temperature to 100 CC for a period of not more than 12 hours.The,amount of the catalyst may be usually not less than 5 molt on the basis of the nitrobenzene. Recovery of the produced 3,5 disubstituted 4ethoxyaniline I Z NH2 from the reaction mixture may be carried out by a per se conventional procedure such as chromatography, distillation or recrystallization.
