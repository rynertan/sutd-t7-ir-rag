# Polyimides and method for their preparation.

## Abstract
Aromatic sulfoxy tetracarboxylic acids, and their deriva tives such as dianhydrides, bisimides and polyimides, are prepared by oxidizing the corresponding sulfides under relatively mild conditions, using oxidizing agents such as nitric acid, N chlorosuccinimide, potassium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide. The polyimides may also be prepared by the reaction of the dianhydrides or certain bisimides with diamines.
