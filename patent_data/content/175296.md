# Fuel burner control system.

## Abstract
A boiler control utilizing a pressure sensor 35, 36 is provided that operates the system in the low fire mode if the load is light, and can be satisfied in that mode. If the low fire operation is inadequate to hold the load and the pressure drops, the boiler 24 is then operated in a modulating mode which includes a high fire limit. This is accomplished by sensing the variation of a pressure responsive means 22 and by providing a burner control system 23 that monitors that pressure responsive means
