# Fuel injection method and apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention is an improved fuel injection system for a compression ignition diesel engine in which fuel is pressurised at 14 and supplied to an injection chamber 74 immediately upstream of an injection valve 84 which is held closed by the pressurised fuel acting on opposed faces 88 and 90 of different areas. When a cam 28 operates a reciprocating spindle 50 , at a certain point in the engine s cycle, a chamber 64 in communication with the face 88 is put into communication with a source 114 of lower pressure so that the valve opens, and pressurised fluid enters the combustion chamber 26 . The charge is replenished from a metering chamber 94 pumped by a piston 96 in response to pressurised fuel in a chamber 98 until, when the chamber 94 is put into communication through the passage 132 with the source of lower pressure fuel, the valve 84 is closed by a shuttle 136 and then differential pressure on the member 50 causes that member to return to its original position for the next cycle.
