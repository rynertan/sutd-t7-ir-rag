## Description
Surface Active ComDositions THIS INVENTION relates to surface active compositions. Alcohol ether sulphate salts of which the anion has the formula FRO C2H4O nS where R is an alkyl group having 10 to 20 and preferably 12 to 16 carbon atoms and n is an integer in the range 1 to 7 and preferably 1 to 4 are known surface active agents which are used in, for example shampoos, liquid dishwashing liquids etc. They are normally produced by ethoxylating an appropriate alcohol, reacting the product with a sulphating agent for example H2SO4, SO3 or S02C12 and neutralising with an amine for example a C1 to C5 mono alkyl amine or ammonia or with an alkali or alkaline earth base or ammonium compound to give the salt which is normally produced as a concentrate containing for example 65 to 75 0 by weight of the salt and a minor amount of water which includes any water of neutralisation and any introduced as solvent for the neutralising agent. Such concentrates are normally viscous liquids, but if free inorganic sulphates, for example sodium sulphate, or the unsulphated alcohol ethoxylate is present the concentrate may become an elastic gell which is difficult to handle. The alcohol ether sulphate salts are normally transpowted as concentrates and then diluted with water and optionally other materials to produce the product ultimately used by the consumer. On dilution of the concentrate another gell of a particularly troublesome type is encountered when a composition of about 55 of the alcohol ether sulphate salt and 45 of water is reached.Frequently ethanol is added to break the gells and allow dilution, but this represents a considerable expense and becuase of its volatility, a fire hazard. We have found that the addition of a compound other than a sulphate or sulphate salt of average molecular weight 500 to 10,000, preferably 500 to 6,000 and more preferably 1,000 to 3,000, which comprises at least one polyalkylene glycol chain, the compound comprising a total of at least two ether linkages per seven carbon atoms, for example a polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 500 to 6,000 reduces he problem of dilution with water. The said compounds are of low volatility, and the quantities required are small. The invention comprises a composition comprising a salt of an alcohol ether sulphate of formula EMI2.1 where R and ri are as previously defined, M is an ammonium, substituted ammcnium, alkali or alkaline earth metal ion and m is the valency of M, arid a gel inhibiting quantity of a compound other than a sulphate or sulphate salt of average molecular weight 500 to 10,000, preferably 500 to 6,000 and more preferably i,000 to 3,000, which comprises at least one polyalkylene glycol chain, the compound comprising a total of at least two ether linkages per seven carbon atoms, for example a polyethylene glycol. The compound may be a polyalkylene or mixed polyalkylene glycol, for example polyethylene glycol or a mixed polyethylene polypropylene glycol, a compound comprising a polyalkylene glycol chain linked to a phenol or alcohol for example an alkyl phenol suitably having 4 to 12 carbon atoms in its alkyl group or groups or alcohol suitably having 1 to 16 and preferably 10 to i6 carbon atoms ethylene oxide condensate or with two or more polyalkylene glycol chains linked to a residue of a compound having two or more active hydrogen atoms, for example, glycerol or butane 1,4 4 diol. The compound is very suitably a polyethylene glycol. By a gel inhibiting quantity is meant an amount sufficient to reduce the maximum elasticity of any gel encountered during dilution with water to at most 4 x Newtons per sq mm and preferably at most 1 x 10 4 Newtons. In general 0.5 to 5 ,0 by weight of polyethylene glycol is used. Compositions according to the inventIon tend to be thixotropic they are readily pumpable in suitable conventional equipment. The salt is suitably a sodium, potassium, magnesium or ammonium salt, and may be produced by neutralising the acid witch a hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of the cation. Direct neutralisation with ammonia or an amine may be carried out. The invention also comprises a process in which the alcohol ether sulphate salt is mixed with a gel inhibiting amount of a compound other than a sulphate or sulphate salt of average molecular weight 500 to 10,000, preferably 500 to 6,000 and more preferably 1,000 to 3,000, which comprises at least one polyalkylene glycol chain, the compound comprising a total of at least two ether linkages per seven carbon atoms, for example a polyethylene glycol, and then diluted with water. Preferably the compound has at least two ether linkages per five carbon atoms.

It contains 28 ether links per 63 carbon atoms and has a molecular weight of 1,400. Synperonic A50 is a commercial product produced by condensing a mixed C13 and C15 alcohol 7 to 3 by molar ratio with c. 50 moles of ethylene oxide per mole. Synperonic OP40 is a product of condensing octyl phenol with c. 40 moles of ethylene oxide per mole. M.W. means molecular weight. Materials with the additives all diluted much more readily with water than the pure material. The time required for comparable dilutions was substantially less, for example one tenth, and no problems were encountered with gel formation during dilution.
