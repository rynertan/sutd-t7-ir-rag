# A pointed heat generating device for molds of injection molding machines.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a pointed heat generating device for molds of injection molding machines. It comprises a metal casing 2 , a pointed projectile heat generating means 3 fixed with the metal casing, and a gate 18 formed at the pointed heat generating means and communicated to a cavity 19 of the molds, characterized in that a heat generating wire 7 is penetrated wholly into a passage which is bored in a non processed cylindrical material 3a and an alloy portion X is formed in an inert gas between an end of the heat generating wire and the non processed cylindrical material, thereby the alloy portion being formed as a pointed part of the heat generating means 3 by machining.
