# Computer memory.

## Abstract
Selection logic 1 responds to 7 out of 22 address bits on a bus 19 to select the module by providing a signal SETRAS, delayed by a signal PRECHG if the same row is address twice in succession. SETRAS generates a row address strobe RAS, a recognition signal ANYRAS and, after a delay 11 , a column address signal CAS 16 address bits held in a latch 3 are multi plexed 8 bits at a time a multiplexer 4 and, in synchronism with RAS and CAS select locations in even and odd memory ar rays 16 and 17 . Two more address bits and selection logic 20 select between four planes in each array. The memory controller responds to the recognition signal ANYRAS to pro vide an output strobe DOUTSTB
