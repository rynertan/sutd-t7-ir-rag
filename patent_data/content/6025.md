# Process for manufacturing a thin film CdS CdTe photovoltaic cell having enhanced conversion efficiency and photovoltaic cell produced by this process.

## Abstract
A photovoltaic cell and a process of making and using it are disclosed wherein extremely thin semiconductor layers are provided through the use of polycrystalline CdS and CdTe. The process involves forming thin contiguous layers of CdS and CdTe on an appropriate substrate, by using a close space sublimation technique in the presence of oxygen.
