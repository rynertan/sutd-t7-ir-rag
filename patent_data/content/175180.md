The conventional synthetic compounds wherein the alpha amino groups in to alpha amino acids are bound by an ethylene group are liniited to those wherein the two alpha amino acids are identical, and such compounds have been prepared by condensing the alpha amino acid with 1,2 dibromoethane see Inorganic Chemistry, 7, 2405 1968 1. No method of synthesis has been reported that unes histidine as the alpha amino acid. The e Histargin related compounds of the present invention contain two different alpha amino acids, and if they are reacted with 1,2 dibrooethane within the same reaction vessel, a complex product results and considerable difficulties are involved in purifying the product. The present inventors have found that these problems can be solved by performing the synthesis stepwise as shown below. Hintargin is first reacted with a 2 halogeno 1,1 dialkoxyethane of formula II EMI16.1 wherein X in a halogen atom and R1 is a lower alkyl group so as to form Na 2,2 dialkoxyethyl histidine of formula III EMI16.2 wherein Rl is a lower alkyl group . Compounds of formula II are commercially available and they include 2 bromoacetaldehyde diethyl acetal, 2 bromoacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal, 2 chloroacetaldehyde diethyl acetal and 2 chloroacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal. Subsequently, the alpha amino group in the histidine portion in formula III is protected by an amino protecting group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group. The aldehyde protecting group is then removed by an acid treatment so as to form an N formylmethyl derivative of formula IV EMI17.1 wherein R2 is an amino protecting group . The compound of formula IV has the cyclic structure represented by formula IV EMI17.2 wherein R2 is an amino protective group . Compound IV is reacted, in the presence of a borohydride derivative, such as sodium cyanoborohydride, tri tert. butoxy borohydride, di si amylborane, thexylborane or the borane THF complex, with an alpha amino acid which may be protected if it has a functional group in the side chain or one having protect ed carboxyl groups.Finally, any protective group is re moved, thus providing the compound of formula I . Examples of the alpha amino acid derivative that is reacted with the compound of formula IV for synthesizing the typical compounds listed in Table 1 include L histidine methyl ester dihydrochloride, L phenylalanine ethyl enter monohydrochloride, N benzyloxycarbonyl L lynine methyl ester monohydrochloride, L proline benzyl ester monohydrochloride, and L aspartic acid ,ss dibenzyl ester tosylate. Alpha amino acids having unprotected carboxyl groups may also be used.In accordance with an alternative method for synthesizing the compound of formula I , an alpha amino acid corresponding toA in formula I is used as the starting material, which is condensed with the compound of formula II , and following the conversion described above, histidine or a protected form thereof is subjected to reaction so as to obtain the desired derivative. Among the typical compounds listed in Table 1, L C2 L Orn indicated by compound No. 6a may also be produced by obtaining natural Histargin from the filtrate of a cultured broth of Histargin producing microorganism of the genus Streptomyces and then by converting the guanidyl group in that Histargin to an amino group. The compounds synthesized by the methods shown above may be esterified by conventional techniques so as to obtain compounds wherein all the carboxyl groups present are esterified. The intermediates for the synthesis shown above may have part of the carboxyl groups protected by an ester in this case, Histargin related compounds having part of the carboxyl groups esterified may be obtained by leaving the ester intact and removing any other protective groups.Examples The following are provided as further illustrations of the invented compound and are not to be construed as limiting.
