# DATA DISPLAY ARRANGEMENT WITH SMOOTH SCROLLING

## Abstract
A data display arrangement in which rows of characters are displayed on a CRT, the display information for the characters being provided by stored data which is accessed recurrently for its display in successive scanning fields. Scrolling of the displayed rows of characters is achieved by progressively delaying the start of the addressing of the stored data relative to the start of each scanning field. By using a row mapping memory, the scrolling principle can be extended such that any row of characters can be displayed at any character row position of the display. This, for instance, enables a display not covering the entire screen to be readily centred. Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the scrolling arrangement.
