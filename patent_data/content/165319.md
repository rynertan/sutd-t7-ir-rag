# METHOD OF FORMING IMAGE.

## Abstract
An image forming method includes a step of allowing electrically conductive light transmitting particles to adhere electrostatically to the surface of a photo conductive subs trate, a step of exposing the surface to the light of an image above the particles, and step of seperating particles which transmitted the light from those which did not transmit the light, to obtain a particle image formed by either of these groups of particles. The method includes an additional step, which is carried out after to the exposure step, of equalizing the potentials of the particles which transmitted the light, and the potentials of the particles which did not transmit the light. Thus it is possible to eliminate the conventional disadvantage that color purity is reduced in portions of high color density.
