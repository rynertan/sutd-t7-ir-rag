# Stopping restarting free radical polymerizations.

## Abstract
A method for stopping and restarting the free radical polymerization of vinyl monomers e.g. acrylic monomers without forming low molecular weight polymer is provided. These polymerizations utilize a Redox catalyst system com prising multivalent metal ions e.g. iron ions as promoter. The polymerizations are stopped by chelation of the iron present. Additonal monomer is added to the polymerization to avoid formation of low molecular weight polymer. Upon restart metal ions are added to the polymerization mixture.
