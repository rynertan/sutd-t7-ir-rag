## Description
The invention describes compositions and methods for maintaining and immobilizing a reservoir of a biologically active agent which provides for the sustained release of the biologically active agent in living systems. According to the present invention, a biologically active agent is entrapped in liposomes which are sequestered in a gel matrix. When used in living systems the liposomes sequestered in the gel matrix provide for prolonged release of liposome entrapped agents and the gel matrix provides for immobilization of the liposomes. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the liposome gel compositions of the present invention can be implanted Liposomes are lipid vesicles which can entrap a variety of pharmaceutical agents and can be used for delivery of these agents to cells and tissues Much has been written regarding the possibilities of using liposomes for drug delivery systems. See for example, the disclosures in U.S. Patent No. 3,993,754, U.s. Patent No. 4,145,410. In liposome delivery systems the medicament is entrapped in the liposome which is administered to the patient to be treated. See U.S. Patent No. 4,224,179 and U.S. Patent No. 4,235,871. Aqueous suspensions of liposomes may be inoculated in any desired way Sustained drug release characteristics can be ascribed to other types of drug microcarriers such as lipid microvesicles microreservoirs described by Sears, U.S. Pat. No. 4,298,594. Polymer matrices and gels have been used to localize delivery or retard dispersion of drugs from the site of administration A variety of other polymeric compounds have been utilized to provide sustained release drug delivery systems, including silicone elastomers of two types, This invention describes liposome gel compositions comprising a bioactive agent entrapped in liposomes sequestered in a gel matrix in which More particularly, liposomes containing bioactive agents are sequestered in a gel matrix which is administered Although incorporation of a bioactive agent directly into a gel matrix may provide for a certain degree of sustained release, entrapment of a bioactive agent in liposomes can provide for a more prolonged release of the agent because the liposome membrane can be prepared or modified to further retard the leak of the entrapped agent. However, because liposomes themselves are degraded or cleared when administered According to one embodiment of the present invention, a suspension of liposomes which entrap a biologically active agent is mixed with a suspension of the gel material. The resulting mixture can be administered In another embodiment of the present invention the liposome gel preparation may be used in cell or tissue culture systems to provide for the prolonged release of the bioactive agent into the culture medium. The liposome gel preparation may serve as a support for cell adhesion and growth alternatively the liposome gel preparation may be applied to the cell culture as an overlay. The rate of release of the entrapped bioactive agent is dependent on the type of liposomes used and the composition of the liposome membranes. In fact populations of different liposomes may be sequestered in the gel matrix. Any type of bioactive agent that can be entrapped in a liposome may be used according to the present invention. Examples of these are listed infra. In fact, two or more bioactive agents entrapped in the same or different populations of liposomes may be sequestered in a gel matrix for use according to the method of the present invention. Finally, one bioactive agent may be entrapped in the liposomes, and the same or a different bioactive agent may be contained in the gel matrix. When this liposome gel preparation is administered, the bioactive agent contained in the gel matrix is released quickly whereas the bioactive agent entrapped in the sequestered liposomes is released slowly. Thus, when one bioactive agent is entrapped in both the sequestered liposomes and in the gel matrix one dose may provide for both the initial dose of the agent and for its sustained release, thereby avoiding the necessity of administering maintenance doses. Alternatively, when one bioactive agent is entrapped in the sequestered liposomes and another bioactive agent is entrapped within the gel matrix, concurrent therapy using any mixture of bioactive agents is possible. The subsections below are illustrative of the types of liposomes, gels and bioactive agents which may be used in the practice of the present invention. Liposomes used in the present invention can be prepared by a number of methods, including but not limited to the original methods of Bangham SPLVs are prepared as follows an amphipathic lipid or mixture of lipids is dissolved in an organic solvent. Many organic solvents are suitable, but diethyl ether, fluorinated hydrocarbons and mixtures of fluorinated hydrocarbons and ether are preferred. To this solution are added an aqueous phase and the active ingredient to be entrapped. This biphasic mixture is converted to SPLVs by emulsifying the aqueous material within the solvent and evaporating the solvent. Evaporation can be accomplished during or after sonication by any evaporative technique, In practice, a minimum of about 3 volumes of solvent to about 1 volume of aqueous phase may be used. In fact, the ratio of solvent to aqueous phase can vary up to 100 or more volumes of solvent to 1 volume aqueous phase. The amount of lipid must be sufficient so as to exceed that amount needed to coat the emulsion droplets about 40 mg of lipid per mℓ of aqueous phase . The upper boundary is limited only by the practicality of cost effectiveness, but SPLVs can be made with 15 gm of lipid per mℓ of aqueous phase. Most amphipathic lipids may be constituents of SPLVs. Suitable hydrophilic groups include but are not limited to phosphato, carboxylic, sulphato and amino groups. Suitable hydrophobic groups include but are not limited to saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydro carbon groups and aliphatic hydrocarbon groups substituted by at least one aromatic and or cycloaliphatic group. The preferred amphipathic compounds are phospholipids and closely related chemical structures. Examples of these include but are not limited to lecithin, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, lysolecithin, lysophatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid and the cerebrosides. Specific examples of suitable lipids useful in the production of SPLVs are phospholipids which include the natural lecithins The following is an example of the proportions that may be used in SPLV synthesis SPLVs may be formed by adding 50 micromoles of phospholipid to 5 mℓ of diethyl ether containing 5 micrograms of butylatedhydroxytoluene BHT and then adding 0.3 mℓ of aqueous phase containing the active substance to be encapsulated. The resultant mixture which comprises the material to be entrapped and the entrapping lipid is sonicated while streaming an inert gas over the mixture thus removing most of the solvent. Another suitable liposome preparation which may be used is lipid vesicles prepared in a monophasic solvent system, hereinafter referred to as monophasic vesicles or MPVs. MPVs are particularly stable and have a high entrapment efficiency. MPVs are prepared by a unique process as follows a lipid or a mixture of lipids and an aqueous component are added to an organic solvent or a combination of organic solvents in amounts sufficient to form a monophase. The solvent or solvents are evaporated until a film forms. Then an appropriate amount of aqueous component is added, and the film is resuspended and agitated in order to form the MPVs. The organic solvent or combination of solvents used in the process must be 1 miscible with water and 2 once mixed with water should solubilize the lipids used to make the MPVs. For example, an organic solvent or mixture of solvents which satifies the following criteria may be used in the process 1 5 mℓ of the organic solvent forms a monophase with 0.2 mℓ of aqueous component and 2 the lipid or mixture of lipids is soluble in the monophase. Solvents which may be used include but are not limited to ethanol, acetone, 2 propanol, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, glyme, dioxane, pyridine, diglyme, 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone, butanol 2, butanol 1, isoamyl alcohol, isopropanol, 2 methoxyethanol, or a combination of chlorform methanol The evaporation should be accomplished at suitable temperatures and pressures which maintain the monophase and facilitate the evaporation of the solvents. In fact, the temperatures and pressures chosen are not dependent upon the phase transition temperature of the lipid used to form the MPVs. The advantage of this latter point is that heat labile products which have desirable properties can be incorporated in MPVs prepared from phospholipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine, which can be formed into conventional liposomes only at temperatures above the phase transition temperature of the phospholipids. The process usually allows more than 30 40 of the available water soluble material to be entrapped during evaporation and 2 15 of the available water soluble material to be entrapped during the resuspension and up to 70 80 of the available lipid soluble material can be entrapped if the lipid drug ratio is increased significantly. With MLVs the entrapment of aqueous phase, which only occurs during the rehydration step since no aqueous phase is present during the drying step, usually does not exceed 10 . Most lipids may be constituents of MPVs. Suitable hydrophilic groups include but are not limited to phosphato, carboxylic, sulphato and amino groups. Suitable hydrophobic groups include but are not limited to saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and aliphatic hydrocarbon groups substituted by at least one aromatic and or cycloaliphatic group. The preferred amphipathic compounds are phospholipids and closely related chemical structures. Specific examples of suitable lipids useful in the production of MPVs are phospholipids which include but are not limited to the natural lecithins or phosphatidylcholines MPVs may advantageously be used in delivery systems wherein a bioactive agent is entrapped within the MPV entrapped is defined as entrapment within the aqueous compartment or within the membrane bilayer . In order to entrap one or more agents in MPVs, the agent or agents may be added to the monophase prior to evaporation and formation of the film. Alternatively, the agent or agents may be added with the aqueous component used to resuspend the film and form the MPVs. In fact, to obtain a high entrapment efficiency, the agent or agents may be added to both the monophase and to the aqueous component used to resuspend the film. Two or more agents can also be entrapped in one MPV preparation by adding one agent to the monophase and the other to the aqueous component used to resuspend the film. Any type of gel matrix may be used in the present invention. The only constraints are 1 the gel matrix must be capable of seqestering the liposomes Any gel can be used in the practice of the present invention. The materials which can be used to form such gels include but are not limited to carbohydrates such as cellulosics, methylcellulose, starch and modified starch, agarose, gum arabic, ghatti, karay, tragacanth, guar, locust bean gum, tamarind, carageenan, alginate, xanthan, chickle, collagen, polyacrylamide, polysiloxanes, polyanhydrides, After the mixture forms a gel the resulting liposome gel matrix can be implanted in tissues. In a particularly useful embodiment of the present invention soft gel matrices such as agarose and collagen containing sequestered liposomes may be injected Alternatively, gels such as methylcellulose can be formed in the tissues after inoculation of liposomes in a suspension containing the gel material. After inoculation the suspension forms a gel and the liposomes remain sequestered in the gel matrix rather than dispersed and cleared. Regardless of the method used for preparing and implanting the gel matrix, the release of a liposome entrapped bioactive agent is prolonged and the relative concentration of the agent at the site of inoculation is increased. Virtually any bioactive agent can be entrapped within the liposomes for use according to the present invention. Such agents include but are not limited to antibacterial compounds, antiviral compounds, antifungal compounds, anti parasitic compounds, tumoricidal compounds, proteins, toxins, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, immunomodulators, dyes, radiolabels, radio opaque compounds, fluorescent compounds, polysaccharides, cell receptor binding molecules, anti inflammatories, antiglaucomic agents, mydriatic compounds, anesthetics, nucleic acids and polynucleotides. In fact, if concurrent therapy is desired, two or more bioactive agents may be entrapped in one liposome population which is sequestered in the gel matrix. Alternatively, two or more liposome populations of the same or different types of liposomes, In yet another embodiment of the present invention the gel can be used as a vehicle for the same or different bioactive agents than those entrapped by liposomes. In certain therapeutic applications it may be desired to deliver a relatively high dose of a drug compound The release of the bioactive agents may be controlled by the type of liposomes used and the membrane composition of the liposome bilayers as well as by the type and porosity of the gels used. The rate of release is also dependent upon the size and composition of the bioactive agent itself. The liposome itself is the first rate limiting factor in the release of entrapped bioactive agents. The rate of release may depend upon the number of bilayers, the size of the liposomes and most importantly the bilayer composition. A number of researchers add stabilizers such as sterols or cholesterols to the phospholipid bilayers in order to alter the permeability of the liposome Papahadjopoulos, D., Kimilberg, H.K., 1974, The gel matrix may be the second rate limiting factor in the release of the bioactive agent. In general, for low molecular weight bioactive agents On the other hand, pore size of the gel may become a rate limiting factor in diffusion of the bioactive agent which is released from the sequestered liposomes when the bioactive agent is of a greater molecular weight. Generally, polyacrylamide gels exclude molecules of 10⁶ Daltons or larger in molecular weight. The pore size of a polyacrylamide gel depends upon the concentration of acrylamide used to make the gel generally 4 to 20 acrylamide is used to prepare these gels . The pore size can be varied further by the extent of crosslinking of the gel. If the molecular weight of the liposome entrapped bioactive agent is known, one skilled in the art could prepare a gel to obtain the approximate diffusion rate desired by controlling the acrylamide concentration and crosslinking of the gel. Soft gels such as methylcellulose, collagen and agarose can be used to control the diffusion of larger molecules that are excluded by polyacrylamide gel In addition to the parameters such as size of the bioactive agent and porosity of the gel which may be used to control the rate of diffusion of bioactive agents released from the sequestered liposomes, the nature of the bioactive agent itself and the gel will further affect the rate of diffusion. Thus, if the bioactive agent has any affinity for the gel matrix Finally, no matter what gel matrix is used to sequester liposomes containing an entrapped bioactive agent, the matrix will be freely permeable to fluids to which it is exposed, The liposome gel compositions of the present invention may be used for sustained delivery of a bioactive agent to cells and or fluids When used For example the liposome gel preparations of the present invention may be inoculated In an alternative example, the liposome gel preparation may be applied topically. Topical application may be particularly useful for the treatment of wounds either surgical or non surgical wounds where the sustained release of antimicrobials and or blood clotting factors may be helpful in the healing process. Similarly, the liposome gel preparation may be topically applied to burns for the sustained release of antimicrobials and or cell growth factors. The liposome gel preparation may also be applied in the ear to treat infections by providing sustained release of antimicrobials this would reduce the necessity of repeated applications of the bioactive agent in the form of ear drops. In another alternative embodiment, the liposome gel preparation may be administered orally for sustained release. Such application may be useful for sustained release to oral epithelium and other oral tissues and for sustained release to epithelia of the alimentary tract. The liposome gel preparations of the present invention may also be used The specific embodiments described above and below are given by way of example only and the invention is limited only by the appended claims. SPLVs containing radiolabeled gentamicin sulfate ¹²⁵I GS SPLVs were prepared as described in Section 4.1 100 mg egg phosphatidylcholine egg PC was added to 5 mℓ diethylether to which 0.3 mℓ phosphate buffered saline PBS containing ¹²⁵I p hydroxyphenyl propionic acid derivatized gentamicin sulfate ¹²⁵I GS was added. The SPLVs were formed by sonicating the resultant mixture while evaporating the diethylether under a stream of nitrogen. The SPLVs were resuspended in 1 mℓ PBS. A 2 solution of methylcellulose usually 400 2000 centipoise in PBS pH 7.2 was prepared by mixing at 4 C until homogeneous, autoclaving at 120 C and cooling for 24 hours at 4 C. An aliquot of the 2 methylcellulose solution was mixed with an equal aliquot of the ¹²⁵I GS SPLV suspension at room temperature. Aliquots 0.1 mℓ of this mixture the ¹²⁵I GS SPLV methylcellulose preparation were inoculated subcutaneously in the abdominal region of adult Swiss Webster mice. Two groups of control mice were treated as follows one group was inoculated subcutaneously in the abdominal region with 0.1 mℓ 1 methylcellulose prepared as described in section 5.1 containing ¹²⁵I GS The subcutaneous immobilization of ¹²⁵I GS was verified by measuring the levels of ¹²⁵I GS in the area of inoculation. To this end, skin and underlying tissues around the site of inoculation approx. 1.5 cm² of abdominal ventral wall were excised 24 hours after inoculation and radioactivity was determined using a gamma counter. The results Table I indicated that indeed liposomes were immobilized at the site of inoculation by the methylcellulose gel matrix. In another similar experiment, mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the lower femural region of the leg with 0.05 mℓ of the ¹²⁵I GS SPLVs methylcellulose preparation. The control mice were inoculated with an equivalent amount of the ¹²⁵I GS SPLVs suspended in PBS. At intervals post inoculation the mice were sacrificed, the entire leg dissected and the radioactivity in the limb determined. The results shown in Table 2 demonstrate that the radioactivity decreased more rapidly in the legs of control mice than in the legs of mice which received the liposome gel inoculation. Thus, the clearance of ¹²⁵I GS is attenuated when liposomes containing this agent are sequestered in the methylcellulose gel matrix and administered intramuscularly. SPLVs were prepared as described in Section 5.1 using 100 mg egg PC and 0.3 mℓ PBS containing ¹²⁵I GS or 0.3mℓ HEPES buffer containing ¹²⁵I human growth hormone ¹²⁵I HGH, New England Nuclear . Solutions of 0.5 2 agarose Bio rad standard low Mr in water or buffer were prepared by melting the polymer powder at 100 C, then sterilizing the solution at 120 C by autoclaving. After cooling, the resulting gel was melted at 60 C. The temperature was then decreased to 42 C. In order to sequester the liposomes and to inoculate the resulting gel liposome preparation, the following procedure was used One volume of agarose solution was mixed with one volume of SPLVs suspended in PBS buffer pH 7.2 . This suspension was immediately aspirated into a needle having a large internal diameter 1.5mm using a syringe adapted to the needle. The syringe was placed horizontally at 4 C to permit the agarose to gel. The gel containing liposomes is a cylinder its volume depending on the internal diameter of the needle and the amount of aspirated solution which can be easily extruded and inoculated. Adult Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with ¹²⁵I GS SPLVs sequestered in 1 agarose gel one gel cylinder mouse . After 24 hr, the mice were sacrificed, the gels were recovered and their radioactivity determined. The results showed that 95 of the initial radioactivity was associated with the recovered gels indicating that the liposomes were efficiently sequestered and maintained at the site of inoculation. ¹²⁵I HGH SPLVs were sequestered in 0.5 2 agarose gels. Adult Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the leg with 0.1 ml of the ¹²⁵I GS SPLV agarose gel preparation. Groups of control mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the leg with 0.1 mℓ of ¹²⁵I GS SPLVs suspended in HEPES buffer, pH 7.2 agarose gels containing ¹²⁵I HGH The results in Table 3 indicate that the ¹²⁵I HGH SPLVs were prepared as described in Section 5.1 using 100 mg egg PC and 0.3 mℓ HEPES buffer containing ¹²⁵I HGH. A gel of acid soluble rat tail collagen was prepared by a modification of the method described by Michalopoulous and Pitot, 1975, Exper. Cell Res. The liposomes were sequestered in the gel as follows An experiment was done to determine the relationship between the amount of lipids as liposomes in gels and the sequestration ability of the gel. Accordingly a 0.2 mℓ aliquot of various liposome dilutions was added to the rat tail collagen in HEPES buffer as described above and allowed to gel at 37 C for 1 hour. Liposomes which were not sequestered in the gel were removed by filtration under vacuum through a nylon mesh filter 81.2 µ pore size McMaster Carr Supply Co., Dayton, NJ . Radioactivity in the gel collected on the filter was determined. Table 4 illustrates that approximately 54 74 of the ¹²⁵I HGH SPLVs could be sequestered in a 0.3 collagen gel. Table 4 also demonstrates that the quantity of liposomes which could be sequestered in the collagen gel might be increased by increasing the concentration of collagen in the gel to 0.9 . Another liposome preparation Table 4 contained fibronectin covalently crosslinked to lipids. The glycoprotein fibronectin which has high affinity for collagen was covalently cross linked to the liposome bilayer by an enzyme catalyzed method described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 533,583 by Weiner et al., filed September 19, 1983. Briefly, ¹²⁵I HGH SPLVs were prepared as described Section 5.1 using egg PC and phosphatidylethanolamine 8 2 mole and Tris tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane saline buffer containing ¹²⁵I HGH. In order to covalently link the fibronectin to the liposomes the ¹²⁵I HGH SPLV suspension was incubated for 2 hours at 37 C with 1 mg fibronectin Seragen Inc., Boston, MA or Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, MA in 1 mℓ Tris saline buffer with 20 mM CaCl2, 100 µg Factor XIII trans glutaminase, Alpha Therapeutic Corp., Los Angeles, CA 1 unit thrombin Sigma, St. Louis, MO . One unit of thrombin will clot a 25 mg fibronectin solutions in 15 seconds at 37C . After incubation the fibronectin modified SPLVs ¹²⁵I HGH FN SPLVs were pelleted at 10,000 X g for 10 minutes, and washed 3 times. As illustrated in Table 4, when fibronectin modified liposomes were added to the collagen gel, a significantly enhanced sequestration of liposomes was achieved. In order to determine the effect of liposome sequestration on the retention of growth hormone in tissues, adult Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the leg with the ¹²⁵I HGH SPLV or ¹²⁵I HGH FN SPLV sequestered in 0.3 collagen gels prepared as described above in Section 7.1 . Control groups were inoculated with ¹²⁵I HGH SPLVs suspended in buffer, or ¹²⁵I HGH in buffer. At intervals post inoculation, mice were sacrificed, the inoculated legs dissected and the residual radioactivity determined. The results Table 5 show that the hormone is optimally retained at the site of inoculation when the liposomes containing the hormone are sequestered in the collagen gel matrix. Modification of the liposome membrane by the attachment of fibronectin, despite a greater sequestration of liposomes in collagen gel see Table 4 did not significantly enhance retention of bioactive agent at the site of inoculation. However a more linear rate of release of ¹²⁵I growth hormone in this group was observed. In another experiment, sustained release of ¹²⁵I HGH from liposomes sequestered in collagen gel prepared using Vitrogen, a commercially available pepsin and acid digested bovine dermal collagen, was compared with that observed when the gel was prepared using the acid solubilized rat collagen. Vitrogen, a product of the Collagen Corp., was obtained from Flow Laboratories McLean, VA . A gel of Vitrogen 0.3 was prepared according to manufacturer s instructions. The liposomes containing entrapped ¹²⁵I HGH were sequestered in the gel as decribed in Section 7.1. Adult Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the leg with ¹²⁵I HGH SPLV or ¹²⁵I HGH FN SPLV sequestered in 0.3 collagen gels prepared using either rat tail acid solubilized collagen or bovine Vitrogen collagen. Control groups were inoculated with ¹²⁵I HGH SPLV suspended in buffer or free ¹²⁵I HGH suspended in rat tail acid solubilized collagen gel. At intervals post inoculation, mice were sacrificed, the inoculated legs dissected, and the residual radioactivity determined. As illustrated in Table 6, although sequestration of liposomes in Vitrogen gel enhanced retention of hormone at the site of inoculation at 7 days post inoculation, this gel was not as effective as the acid solubilized rat tail collagen. Modification of the sequestered liposomes with fibronectin significantly enhanced retention of hormone at the site of inoculation with both forms of the gel at 1 day post inoculation, but not at 7 days post inoculation for the Vitrogen gel. An additional experiment was done to verify whether the growth hormone released SPLVs containing insulin insulin SPLVs were prepared as described in Section 4.1 100 mg dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine was dissolved in 5 mℓ diethyl ether. To this was added 0.3 mℓ of aqueous buffer either PBS or 0.01 M Tris at pH 7.4. containing 15 mg bovine insulin 25 unit mg Sigma Chemical CO., St. Louis, MO . In order to solubilized the insulin in the aqueous buffer, it was necessary first to partition the hormone powder into a solution 50 mg mℓ of sonicated small unilamellar vesicles composed of EPC. Following solubilization, the aqueous droplet was emulsified into the ether phase by sonicating under a stream of nitrogen until the ether was completely evaporated. The lipid insulin paste was rehydrated to form insulin SPLVs. The insulin SPLVs were washed three times in buffer containing 10 mm CaCl₂. The CaCl₂ facilitated pelleting of the insulin SPLVs. Entrapment of insulin as determined by ¹⁴C insulin label was 20 30 . Sustained release of insulin from insulin SPLVs and insulin SPLVs sequestered in collagen gel was examined in a diabetic animal model. Diabetes was developed in Sprague Dawley rats, supplied by either Charles River Laboratories Wilmington, MA or Hilltop Laboratory Animals Scottsdale, PA by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, 50 mg kg on two consecutive days. Two weeks post injection, diabetes was assessed by measuring water consumption, urine volume and urine glucose. Urine glucose was determined using a glucose assay kit No. 15 UV Sigma Chemical CO., St. Louis, MO . Insulin SPLVs were sequestered in collagen gel 0.9 collagen as described in Section 7.1. Experimental animals received a single subcutaneous injection of insulin SPLVs in the collagen gel in the hind limb corresponding to 4 mg insulin kg body weight. Control animals received a single subcutaneous injection of either free insulin in buffer, free insulin in collagen gel, or free insulin SPLVs in an amount equivalent to experimental animals. A minimum of five animals was used for each group. As illustrated in Table 8, urine glucose values were depressed in diabetic rats which received a single subcutaneous injection of either free insulin SPLVs or insulin SPLVs sequestered in collagen gel. In animals treated with insulin SPLVs only, however, the maximum glucose depression hence, greatest insulin release was seen at 8 hours post treatment. Glucose in urine began to rise again in these animals after 24 hours. On the other hand, in animals treated with insulin SPLVs sequestered in collagen gel, maximum glucose depression was seen at 2 days post treatment. A statistically significant greduction in urine glucose was still evident one week post treatment. This indicates that sequestration of the liposomes in collagen gel impedes the release of insulin to the systemic circulation because no difference would be expected if the release of insulin was solely a liposome dependent phenomenon. It should be noted that free insulin subcutaneously injected was rapidly cleared within 4 hours from the systemic circulation data not shown .
