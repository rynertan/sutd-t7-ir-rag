# FIBER OPTIC TRANSDUCERS

## Abstract
A fiber optic transducer for sensing ambient conditions by converting small displacements into light intensity variations comprises first and second optical signal transmission lines 21, 23 each of transparent material with a refractive index n₁ and a planar end face 26, 27 oriented at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis means for positioning said end faces 26, 27 in a substantially parallel relationship and separated by a transparent material with a refractive index n₂ less than n₁, a distance d that is variably dependent on variations caused by said ambient condition to be sensed, said distance d having a maximum of the order of a wavelength, in the separating material, of an optical signal to be propagated in said transmission line said angle of said end faces being determined such that at least one light ray of an optical signal propagating within said first and second transmission lines 21, 23 is incident thereto at angle of incidence greater than the critical angle for an interface between transparent materials with refractive indices n₁ and n₂, respectively.
