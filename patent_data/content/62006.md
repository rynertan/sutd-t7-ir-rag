# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REPEATEDLY DEFLECTING A BEAM OF COHERENT RADIATION

## Abstract
The method allows to repeatly deflect a beam of coherent radiation for obtaining a substantial saw tooth motion for the beam. The radiation is first polarized so as to generate a plurality of successive output elementary beams of corresponding polarization. The polarization occurs according to a sequential law whose frequency is substan tially equal to the frequency of the saw tooth motion of the beam. The output elementary beams are then deflected successively of a same given angular value according to a substantial sine law before the commutation of the deflexion to a next output elementary beam. The output elementary beams are deflected according to a same common path way so as to generate a saw tooth motion of the beam thereon.
