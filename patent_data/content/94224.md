# A photoreceptor.

## Abstract
A photoreceptor is described comprising a photoconduc tive layer composed of hydrogenated and or fluorinated amorphous silicon, a surface modifying layer formed on said photoconductive layer and composed of hydrogenated and or fluorinated amorphous silicon carbide, and a charge transport layer formed below said photoconductive layer and composed of hydrogenated and or fluorinated silicon carbide, wherein the thickness t of said surface modifying layer is selected in a range 400 Å t 2,000 Å.
