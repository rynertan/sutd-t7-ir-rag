# CARDIAC STIMULATOR

## Abstract
A cardiac stimulator comprising a high voltage generating circuit arrangement having a pair of output ter minals and adapted to produce across said output terminals a high voltage of sufficient magnitude for causing an elec tric current to flow through a high impedance load circuit connected to said output terminals, said electric current having a magnitude and waveform suitable for cardiac stimulation of an area within a body. In a preferred embodi ment the cardiac stimulator is adapted to transfer the elec tric stimulating current to the heart and or organs to be stimulated through the high impedance current conductive path such as presented by a conventional catheter contain ing a conventional liquid solution, such as a saline solution, which provides a path for conducting electrical current pulses to the area to be stimulated. One embodiment of such a high voltage generating circuit arrangement comprises a feedback control circuit which is adapted to maintain the output current flowing through said output terminals during the respective pulse interval at a substantially constant level. In another embodi ment said circuit arrangement includes sensing means for producing a control signal representative of the magnitude of the load connected to said output terminals, said control signal being effective to adjust the high voltage developed across said output terminals in order to achieve the desired output current through said load.
