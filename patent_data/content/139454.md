# Apparatus for producing polyacetylene film.

## Abstract
An apparatus for producing a polyacetylene film by polymerizing acetylene gas in contact with Ziegler Natta catalyst comprising in a vessel to be introduced with acetylene gas a film producing container for storing Ziegler Natta catalyst, a pair of feed rollers provided adjacently to draw out the polyacetylene film polymerized on the surface of the catalyst and reversely driven in roll contact with each other, a cleaning member for cleaning the drawn polyacety lene film, and a winding unit for winding the polyacetylene film. Thus, the polyacetylene film can be continuously produced with good productivity, and since the speed for drawing the polyacetylene film is varied to regulate the thickness of the film, the films of various size can be readily fabricated in mass production, thereby the cost of the polyacetylene film.
