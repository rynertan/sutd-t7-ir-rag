## Description
METHOD XXD PLANT BOR SYNTRETIZING IRON OF ZEOlITES This invention relates to a method and a plant for synthetizing iron free zeolites. As is known, zeolites are employed in a variety of fields, e.g. as selective adsorbents in the industry, as additives in the preparation of animal feed, in catalysis, and clot preventing agents for fertilizers. It has also been found that zeolites may be useful in the production of detergents. However, in the latter instance, it is essential that the zeolites being used be free of iron, which would otherwise jeopardize the final product characteristics. The zeolites utilized in the formation of detergents allow a partial substitution of sodium tripolyphosphate SUP , so that the detergent quality remains unaffected0 The partial substitution of STP and of other similar materials by zeolites is closely related to the ecological issue, in that it can control and minimize the problems from eutrophization. Consequently, it becomes increasingly more important to develop processes which enable ironfree zeolites to be obtained from low cost, readily available materials occurring in nature. Renown heretofore have been several methods of producing zeolites from natural materials, namely, for example 1. Rydrothermal synthesis of zeolites from rheolitic glass, kaolins, clays, etc., in the presence of sodium or potassium bases, or both. 2. Rydrothermal synthesis from leucite as the base product in the production of semisynthetic glass suitable for the preparation of SauJasite. Such prior methods result in the formation of zeolites which contain iron, because iron is a natural component of the starting prime materials. It is apparent how, when iron free zeolites are the objective, it becomes necessary to use some materials for starting materials which are free of iron. However, even in such a case, it is not possible to achieve a condition of total absence of iron, because commercially avadl able starting materials such as sodium silicate, aluminate, and carbonate also contain trace iron.Irrespective of the nature of such starting materials, as is well known to the skilled ones, the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites may be carried out in accordance with either of the following methods 1. Acidification ofa solution of sodium silicates, preferably with mineral acids, to produce a silicon gel which is in turn treated with a soda containing solution of sodium aluminate. 2. Addition of a solution of sodium aluminate and hydroxide to an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, which upon boiling, yield standard condition zeolites. As specified at the outset, such methods suffer from some limitations. In particular, in the instance of a natural material such as pumice, kaolin, clay, etc., it is impossible to obtain zeolites which are entirely free of trace iron, because that element always remains on the solids obtained by hydrothermal synthesis zeolite as a result of the hydrothermal conditions to which the synthesis must be subjected. In the case of the synthesis from solutions it is necessary to have available starting materials containing siliciui and alluminnm oxides completely free of iron. Another disadvantage of such prior methods is that they require long contact times, or involve the use of highly expensive starting materials, particularly where the objective is iron free zeolites since the starting materials must then be subJected to some special prior treatments to purify them. In view of the above outlined situation, it is a primary object of this invention to provide a method and a plant for synthetizing iron free zeolites from natural materials containing silicon, aluminium, and iron oxides, and other materials selected from the broad class of such natural products as kaolin, clay, pumice, etc. the method being required to utilize readily available natural materials and to involve low contact times for synthetizing the zeolites. Further, the inventive method is to be specially flexible and enable the obtainment on one and the same plant a broad range of solutions characterized by different SiO A1203 and SiONa2O ratli, simply by changing the alkaline attack conditions during the initial processing stage.Finally, said method is to enable correlation of the synthesis conditions and type of synthesis product, and concurrent full use also of the solid residue from the initial processing stage. The invention is further directed to providing a very simple plant for implementing the inventive method reaction. These objects are achieved by a method for synthetizing zeolites, according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises the steps of hydrothermally attacking natural products such as kaolins, clays, pumice, and the like or natural products containing oxides such as SiO2 and A1203S and filtering the resulting solution to separate the solid residue containing iron or compounds thereof from a solution constituting the iron free master liquor hydrothermally treating the master liquor at a constant temperature and for a preset time period, and finally filtering the same to obtain iron free zeolites. Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the method according to the invention and of a preferred, though not exclusive, embodiment of the plant, as illustrated by way of example and not of limitation in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating the principles underlying the method according to the invention Figure 2 shows schematically a plant implementing the inventive method and Figure 3 is a detail view of the plant shown inFigure 2. The method, as illustrated by the block diagram of Figure 1, comprises essentially two steps. The first step is represented by the hydrothermal attack, wherein the starting material is subjected to a hydrothermal treatment in a soda alkaline medium, thas forming a solid zeolitic residue containing all of the iron initially present on the solids. In this condition, the starting solids undergoes an irreversible change from amorphous into iron rich zeolite, since as is known, iron, in strongly alkaline conditions, precipitates or is fixed as Fe OH 3. At the same time, a part of the starting material rich in Si02 and Al203 and iron free goes into the solution and forms what will be called hereinafter the master liquor.This first step of the method is summarized in Figure 1 by the blocks 1 of hydrothermal attack proper, 2 of filtering, 3 of drying the solid zeolite residue, and 4 of obtainment of the master liquor. Thus the master liquor is free of iron because the pR of the hydrothermal attack step, having been kept within the range of from 10 to 12 and above, prevents the iron from going into the solution, since in such conditions it precipitates on the zeolite as iron hydroxide or is incorporated into the zeolite by ionic exchange or into the zeolitic structure. The second step of the method will be called hereinafter the zeolitization process, and comprises treating the master liquor until iron free zeolites are released. Tbis second step is exemplified by the blocks 5 of hydrothermal attack of the master liquor, 6 of filtration of the resulting zeolites, and 7 of final drying. The block 8 denotes the step of recycle of the residues from the second filtration, which are reused for the hydrothermal attack of the block 1. Shown schematically in Figure 2 is a plant implementing the inventive method. Particularly at 10, there is indicated the reactor or mixer of the first stage, which is connected, by means of a circulation pump 11, to a boiler 12. Downstream of the mixer 10, there is provided a trap or filter 13, whereat the solid residue is separated from the master liquor.More specifically, the solid residue is passed to a drier 14 and then stored in a storing tank 15. The master liquor leaving the trap 13 is sent to a reconcentrator 16 and whence, through an additional pump 23, into the mixer 17 of the second stage. If desired, other starting materials, such as sodium hydroxide, aluminum oxide, and water, are added into said mixer. The mixer 17 of the second stage is also connected, through a pump 18, to a boiler 19, to keep constant the temperature within the mixer or reactor 17. Upon completion of this zeolitization step, the resulting product is passed to a trap or separator 20 which is operative to separate the residue from the zeolites. Said zeolites are then transported to a drier 21, and then stored in a storing tank 22. Figure 3 shows in detail either one of the mixers 10 and 17 of Figure 2. More specifically, said mixers comprise two parts, a cylindrical body and the driving, speed reducing part. The mixer has a heating jacket for diathermic oil heating, the inlet whereof is designated with the reference numeral 30. Indicated at 31 are seats for the thermocouples. Provided at the bottom end of the cylinder is a valve 32 for exhausting the finial product, and arranged in the box like structure of the cover are seats for the seals of the impeller shaft, the pressure gauge, and safety valve. Also provided are an inlet for connection to a vapor cooling system and for a liquid charging pipe, and a charging section including a door 33. The impeller, which is connected to a gear motor through a reduction gear 34, has shaped blades. The mixer has control and safety systems. Some factual examples will be next described of application of the inventive method in connection withLipari pumice. However, the method may be used also with such other natural materials as kaolin, clay, etc. Within the above criteria, the method according to this invention may be explained through the reactions listed hereinafter limited to optimum conditions. 1. Lipari pumice NaOH T zeolites containing tFe Master liquor, where T 85 C T 102 105 C solids liquid ratio 1 2.5 1 50 t 1 to 7 h NaOH concentration 9 to 200A T 2. Master fiquor laeolite free of Fe scrubbing R20 where T 950 to 1Q50C t 1 to 10 h In particular, the process 1 which allows master liquid to be obtained is indicated as hydrothermal attack while the process described by the reaction 2 which leads to obtaining iron free zeolites is called zeolitization process. More precisely, the reactors, thermostatically maintained at the reaction temperature are filled with a starting solution comprising sodium hydroxide in concentration ranging from 9 to 20 .Then, the pumice as weighed in variable quantities according to the solids liquid ratio is slowly poured and, after suitably stirring, the reaction is initiated for a number of hours which is occasionally specified. After the treatment the fine reaction pulp is filtered under a vacuum and the filtrate is removed. This, as placed in a suitable vessel, is kept for two hours at 110 C in a stove to remove any adsorbed liquid. Depending on the conditions of hydrothermal conversion of pumice into zeolite hundreds of liquors have been obtained which when analyzed by Atomic Absorption issued SiO2 Awl203 ratii varying in the range of from 15 to 1560.Such liquors rich in Sits, A1203 and NaOH have been subjected to a zeolitization process at a temperature ranging from 950 to 105 C and reaction times from 1 to 7 hours following correction, if necessary, of the concentration of said compounds to the required stoichiometric ratii to obtain A or X zeolites or any other zeolite, EXAMPLE 1 Introduced into a stainless steel reactor reactor 10 in Figure 2 , the temperature of which is controlled by a thermostat and provided with a reflux condenser of a mechanical homogenizer are a 2000 ml of aa aqueous NaOH solution containing 11 by weight of NaOH b 400 g pumice. Temperature is maintained at 950C for 5 hours.Upon completion of the reaction the solid residue is separated from the master liquid by means of a filter trap 13 , whence it is sent to a drier 14 and then stored in a storing tank 15. Said iron impure zeolite shows on X ray analysis a high degree of crystallinity as confirmed by a good capability of adsorbing H20.The latter parameter, evaluated by means of a dynamic apparatus, amounts for said sample to about 15 by weight.The master liquid leaving the trap 13 is sent, through an additional pump 23, into the mixer 17 of the second stage. That liquor has the following composition 1.27 SiO2. 0.072 Al2O3. 1.17 Na2O.5.6 H2O By suitably correcting the critical ratii SiO Al2O3 Na2O SiO2 H2O Na2O of the solutions obtained as above, one realizes, in solution, the following composition compatible with the stoichiometric ratii of zeolite A SiO2 Al2O3 1.3 Na2O SiO2 3 H2O Na2O 70 Then one proceeds to the crystallization of the solid amorphous aluminium silicate maintaining said reaction mixture at the temperature of 105 C for a time period ranging from 5 hours to 7 hours. Then, one proceeds with separating the master liquor by the trap 20 and with scrubbing with deionized water. The filtrate, placed in a capsule, is held for 2 hours at 1100C in a drier 21 for the purpose of removing any adsorbed liquid. The resulting solid product, appears to be, by X ray analysis, of the type A, with a high degree of crystallinity. Also determined has been the ionic exchange power of anhydrous zeolite.That determination provides for an intense agitation of a zeolite suspension in a solution of CaCl2 and MgCl2 for a time period ranging from 1 to 20 minutes and at an ambient temperature of 22 2OC the results obtained are listed here below Capacity for exchange mg CaO g 5 min 20 minCalcareous solutions 110 150 wiagnesium solutions 12 36 RTAMWIz 2 The reactor of Example 1 is loaded with a 200 ml of an aqueous solution of 12 by weightNaOH b 400 g pumice the reaction temperature is maintained at 950C for 5 hours.Separation of the reaction products has been effected in accordance with the same procedure followed in Example 1. The resulting solid residue shows when X ray analysed a high crystallinity, the zeolite obtained in this case is Fausasite. The master liquor obtained in this case has the following composition 1.41 SiO2 0.06 Al2O3 1.35 Na2O 55.6 H2O That liquor is delivered into the mixer 17 of the second stage, wherein the molar ratii are corrected between the components of the reaction mixture in order to establish an equivalent composition to the stoichiometric ratii of zeolite A in these cases such ratii are the following SiO2 Al2O3 2.0 Na2O SiO2 1.6 H2O Na2O 20 Then, one proceeds with the crystallization of the sodium aluminium silicate, maintaining the reaction mixture at the temperature of 95 100 C for 1 to 5 hours, again nnder powerful stirring. Then, one proceeds with the separation of the solid product from the master liquor and later with the drying thereof as per Example 1. The resulting solid product is of Type A with a high degree of crystallinity. The exchange capacity of the resulting zeolite has been determined as explained in Example 1,and is of 150 mgr CaO g zeolite in the instance of calcareous water.EXAMPLE 3 From a treatment as in Example 1, a solution master liquor has been obtained which contains 93.71 g i SiO2 3.84 g l Al2 97.37 g l Na20 The composition of the liquor thus obtained has been suitably changed by the addition of NaAlO2,Na2O, H2O, thereby the critical ratii of the solution are the following SiO2 Al2O3 2.5 Na2O SiO2 1.6 H2O Na2O 20 The solid product obtained following crystallization a8 per Example 1 in suitable time and temperature conditions shows to be upon X ray analysis zeolite A. Tests of ionic exchange in calcareous and magnesium solutions yield the following values Capacity for ionic exchange mg CaO g 5 min. 10 min.Calcareous solutions 120 155Magnesium solutions 30 45EXAMPLE 4 In conformity with a treatment as above, a master liquid has been obtained which has a composition in terms of oxides, as follows 1.41 SiO2 O.06 A1203 1.35 Na20 45.8 H20Based upon known methodologies to the skilled one, suitably correcting the final composition fed to synthesis into SiO2 Al2O3 1.5 Na2O SiO2 2 H2O Na2O 65 after a time period ranging from 1 to 5 hours and at a temperature of 100 C a prevalence of zeolite A has been obtained.EXAMPLE 5 By operating in accordance with the methodology, set forth above, there has been obtained during the first step of the process, in appropriate conditions, an Fe impure solid product which, upon X raying, shows to be of the Faujasitic type. The corresponding master liquid had such a composition in terms of SiO2, Al2O3 and Na2O as to satisfy the following molar ratii SiO2 Al2O3 20 Na2O SiO2 0.014 H2O Na2O 23,35 By suitably correcting the composition of the above liquor so as to establish in the solution the following molar ratii Si0 Al203 2.5 Na20 SiO2 1.6 H20 a20 25 and operating in the conditions as set forth hereinbefore, one obtains after 3 hours at 100 C a product mainly made up of zeolite X. EXAMPLE 6 By operating with the same methodology as in Example 1 in appropriate conditions of time, temperature and NaOH concentration, a master liquor has been obtained whose composition Table A has been modified with the addition of NaAlO2, H2O and Na2O, such that the overall ratii, as expressed in moles, between the components of the reaction mixture are equivalent to the stoichiometric ratii of Zeolite A Table A . TABLE A Composition Master liquor Reaction mixtureSiO2 Al2O3 25.75 2.5 Na2O SiO2 2.03 2.4H20 Na20 21.37 25 Operating with methodologies as set forth hereinbefore, a mixture of zeolite A and X has been obtained by operating at 100 C for 1 to 7 hours.EXAMPLE 7 From a hydrothermal treatment as perExample 1, a solution has been obtained in suitable synthesis conditions which has the following composition 1.6 SiO2 O.04 Al 0 1.89 Na20 43.46 H O 23 The composition of the resulting liquor has been suitably modified to obtain the following final ratii SiO Al2O3 2.5 Na2O SiO2 1.2 H2O NaO 30 The reaction time required for crystallization has been 3 hours at a temperature of 950 C. The zeolitic product obtained in such synthesis conditions is a mixture of zeolite A and X having a high degree of crystallinity. EXAMPLE 8 A zeolitization process has been carried out on the same liquor as in Example 7 which envisaged different concentrations of the solution components, in particular a different SiO2 Al2O3 ratio and different synthesis conditions. In the final conditions of SiO2 Al2O3 3.3 Na2O SiO2 1.2 H2O Na2O 30 after a reaction time of 6 hours at a temperature of 950C a single zeolitic X species has been obtained having a high degree of crystallinity. ELAKPLE 9 Example 1 has been repeated leaving the reaction conditions unchanged biit altering the solution composition in terms of the SiO2 4l2O3 ratio.From the solution whose final composition was SiO2 Al2O3 5.3 Na2O SiO2 1.2 H2O Na2O 30 zeolite x has been obtained. The resulting zeolitic product shows on 1 raying a high crystallinity. To gather further confirmation that the liquors, and hence the zeolitic products obtained therefrom with the methodology described hereinabove, are free ofFe, perborate decomposition tests have been carried out. That determination consists of evaluating the perborate residue percentage as it is mixed with an amount of zeolite at a temperature of 600C for 20 minutes. As may be seen from the results brought forth inTable 1, our zeolites have a very low perborate decomposition power, thus showing the mere presence of trace Fe. TABLE 1 Composition Decomposed perborate Example 1 28Example 2 27Example 3 30Example 4 25Example 5 19Example 6 20 TABLE 1 continued Composition Decomposed perborate ffi Example 7 20Example 8 22Example 9 25 Commercial Control Type 4A 45 As may be noted from the foregoing description, the method of this invention achieves its objects. In particular, the method described allows both iron free and iron containing zeolites to be obtained simultaneously, not only from a natural material but also from any material rich in silicon and aluminium oxide. This is specially advantageous, in that it enables the use of starting materials which are available in large quantities to an almost unlimited extent and readily available.The process is the more convenient in that the water glass molar SiO2 Na20 3.46 , a product which is generally used by the other methods of synthetizing zeolites, is ordinarily prepared by heating in a kiln a mixture of siliceous sand and sodium carbonate, with a considerable expenditure of energy, whereas the silicate and or silicates present in the master liquor according to the invention may be obtained with considerable energy savings, directly in solution, by hot digesting hydrothermal treatment pumice in a caustic soda solution. Further, the inventive method affords the advantageous characteristic that the synthesis process described involves relatively short contact times, low synthesis temperatures, and considerable flexibility of the system. In fact, the temperature range may extend from 850C to boiling 1020 1050C , and possibly even above that the sodium hydroxide concentration may vary within the 9 20S range and above, the contact time in the range from 1 to 10 hours, thus enabling an improved control on the quality of the synthesis product depending on the initial reaction conditions. That feature reflects in quite high energy savings and important economical advantages as well as in purity characteristics.In fact, as is apparent from the foregoing examples, the amount of iron present in the zeolites obtained by synthesis from the master liquor steps 5 6 7 of the diagram ofFigure 1 never exceeds 10 ppm, that positive feature being also confirmed by the slower rate of decomposition of the perborate in the zeolites obtained in accordance with the method according to this invention than those commercially available. That feature makes the product obtained from the master liquor in the manner illustrated hereinabove particularly suitable for use in detergents. In fact, as is known to the skilled one, a basic property of zeolites for detergent applications must be that of not decomposing the perborate significantly, which perborate is a component of commercial detergent formulations added thereto on account of its bleaching properties.Since even trace iron is known to decompose the perborate, the importance of this invention as relates to the use of such zeolites in the detergent industry becomes quite apparent. The fact is to be added to said positive features that the zeolites obtained in accordance with this invention show a high degree of exchange toward calcium and magnesium comparable with commercial zeolites as well as a grain size within the limits required for effective washing. From a more general standpoint, particularly advantageous is the fact that the master liquid, as obtained as the product of the initial processing stage, being rich in sodium hydroxide, is more stable than similar solutions of aluminates having a low alkaline content, in fact, contrary to what occurs in such cases, there occurs no aluminium hydroxide precipitation. Of not negligible import is also the low cost of the prime material, the possibility of enhancing the value of prime materials available in the territory, the possibility of expansion to include other low value materials containing SiO2, Al203 and Fe oxides, and the absolute conversion flexibility and reaction selectivity. Moreover the system required to implement the inventive method is extremely simple.
