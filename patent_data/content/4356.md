## Description
TITLE Polyurethanes Prepared with Tetrahydrofuran Alkylene Oxide Polymerizates Having Low Oligomeric Cyclic Ether Content, Processes for Preparing the Same, and Articles and Fibers of the PolyurethanesDESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to polyurethanes which are reaction products of 1 a polymerizate of tetrahydrofuran THF and an alkylene oxide AO , 2 an organic polyisocyanate and 3 an aliphatic polyol or a polyamine chain extender. It is more particularly directed to such polyurethanes prepared with THF AO polymerizates which contain no more than about 3 , by weight, of oligomeric cyclic ethers.Background Art THF AO polymerizates are known and have been used in the preparation of polyurethanes, as shown, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,425,999 to Axelrood andLajiness and U.S. Patent 4,071,492 to Bethea andFutamura. The polymerizates shown in these patents contain as much as 7 10 , by weight, of oligomeric cyclic ether byproducts. When such polymerizates are used in preparing polyurethanes, the presence of the cyclic ether byproducts tends to degrade the polyure thane s properties. This degradation manifests itself in much the same way as that encountered when an excess of plasticizer is used the lower molecular weight cyclic ethers vaporize slowly at elevated temperatures and are leached out by water and common organic liquids, which results in weight loss and undesirable dimensional changes. These undesirable effects are at a minimum in the polyurethanes of the invention, which are prepared with THF AO polymerizates which contain no more than about 3 , by weight, of oligomeric cyclic ethers.Disclosure of the Invention The THF AO copolymers in the polymerizates used to prepare the polyurethanes of the invention contain 2 70 , by weight, of AO units, preferably 30 50 . The copolymers have number average molecular weights of 500 5000, preferably 650 2000, and have hydroxyl functionalities of 2.0 4.0, preferably 2.0.Mixtures of such polymerizates can also be used. Number average molecular weight is determined by first determining the hydroxyl number of the copolymer by titration with acetic anhydride according to ASTM D 1638 and then converting this number to number average molecular weight according to the formula Molecular weight 56 100 X n hydroxyl weight hydroxyl number where n is the hydroxyl functionality of the copolymer. The THF AO polymerizate used to prepare the polyurethanes of the invention can be made by reducing the oligomeric cyclic ether content of a conventionalTHF AO polymerizate by bringing the polymerizate into contact with a cationic exchange resin. The resin can be any acidic cationic ion exchange resin bearing S03H groups and insoluble in the reaction medium in which it is being used. Insoluble means that the amount of resin which dissolves in the medium under process conditions will give the treated polymerizate an acid number of no greater than 0.05 mg of KOH per gram. The nature of the backbone of the resin is unimportant. The most common commercially available resins of this type have backbones which are crosslinked copolymers of styrene and divinyl benzene, but resins having other backbones can be used.Preferred among the styrene divinyl benzene resins, and preferred for use in practicing the invention, is one sold by the Rohm Haas Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as Amberlysts 15. This macroreticular resin has an initial hydrogen ion concentration of about 4.9 milliequivalents per gram dry , an initial surface area of about 40 50 square meters per gram, an initial porosity of 0.3 0.35 milliliter of pore per milliliter of bead, and an initial average pore diameter of 200 600 Angstrom units. These values tend to change somewhat as the resin is used. Illustrative of an ion exchange resin having a backbone other than a crosslinked copolymer of styrene and divinyl benzene is one sold by E. I.du Pont de Nemours and Company as Nafione perfluorosulfonic acid resin. This resin is a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and a monomer represented by the structureEMI3.1 These copolymers are prepared in the sulfonyl fluoride form and are then hydrolyzed to the acid form, as described in U.S. Patent 3,692,569. The ion exchange resins having styrene divinyl benzene copolymer backbones are preferably pretreated before use as follows 1. The resin is placed in a column, back washed with water, allowed to settle and then drained. 2. Two bed volumes of 2N HC1 are run through the resin over a twenty minute period. 3. The acid is washed from the resin with five bed volumes of water. At the end of the cycle, water is drained from the resin until a 2.5 cm head remains at the top level of the bed. 4. Two bed volumes of 1.5N NaOH are run through the resin over a twenty minute period. 5. The base is washed from the resin with five bed volumes of deionized water. At the end of the cycle, water is drained from the resin until a 2.5 cm head remains at the top level of the bed. 6. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated. 7. The resin is washed with boiling water for one half hour. Two bed volumes of a 1 1 volume mixture of methanol and water are then run through the bed. 8. The resin is dried. Once pretreated, and with periodic regeneration according to well known methods, the resin can be used indefinitely, although long use may cause attrition of the resin or color formation and make its use impractical. The use of fresh catalyst is therefore preferred. The process of preparing the polymerizate is begun by adding to a raw THF AO polymerizate 0.525 , preferably 3 7 , by weight of the polymerizate, of the ion exchange resin. The resulting reaction mass is continuously agitated and brought to a temperature of 60 1500C, preferably 90 1100C, and held there, preferably under a vacuum of 13.3 kilopascals 100 mm of Hg or less, with agitation, until its oligomeric cyclic ether content has been brought down to the desired level. The time required to reach the desired oligomeric cyclic ether level varies with the original cyclic ether content of the polymerizate and the temperature at which the process is conducted, but normally that level will be reached in 1 4 hours, the higher process temperatures favoring shorter times. When the process of preparing the THF AO polymerizate is run at the preferred temperatures,THF, water and various byproducts are given off from the reaction mass. These substances can be withdrawn from the reaction zone by sweeping it with an inert gas such as nitrogen or by running the process under vacuum. The process can be run batchwise or in a continuous fashion. When run continuously, the process is preferably run in stages to avoid the adverse effects of backmixing, as is well known in the art. In the continuous mode, the ion exchange resin is held in the reaction zone by suitable filters or screens. When the process is run batchwise, the liquid product is removed from the reaction vessel, preferably by decantation, leaving the resin behind. The vessel can then be refilled and a new reaction begun, using the original resin. The ion exchange method of reducing oligomeric cyclic ether content is described in greater detail in European Patent Application Serial No.79100234.8, which application is incorporated into this application for the purpose of describing the method. The THF AO polymerizates used according to the invention can also be prepared using alternative methods. For example, they can be prepared by subjecting polymerizates having high oligomeric cyclic ether content to molecular distillation, using conventional techniques, by extracting the ethers from the polymerizates with water using sequential washes and separations of the resulting aqueous and organic layers or using countercurrent extraction, or by bringing the polymerizate into contact with an acidactivated sodium or calcium montmorillonite clay. The molecular distillation and waterextraction methods are described in greater detail inEuropean Patent Application Serial No. 791002235.5.The montmorillonite clay method is described inEuropean Patent Application Serial No. CK 1008 A with the title Method for ReducingOligomeric Cyclic Ether Content of a filed on March 16, 1979. The texts of these two applications are incorporated into this application by reference for the purpose of describing the methods in greater detail.

Mixtures of amines can also be used. The polyurethanes of the invention are prepared in two steps, the first of which is conducted under nitrogen at ambient pressure to prevent oxidation of the reactants and product, and to prevent exposure of the reaction mass to atmospheric moisture.In the first step, the THF AO polymerizate starting material is dried by heating it at a temperature of 80 1000C under vacuum, and is then heated to 601250C, preferably about 70 900C, and held there while an excess over the stoichiometric amount, preferably twofold to tenfold, of organic diisocyanate is added, with stirring. The actual amount of isocyanate used depends on the molecular weight of the THF AO polymerizate, as is well known in the art. The reaction mass is held for about 1 4 hours at 60 1250C, with stirring, and the free isocyanate content of the mass is then determined by titration with di n batylamine, as described in Analytical Chemistry of the Polyurethanes, Volume XVI, Part III, D. J. David and H. B.Staley, Wiley Interscience, 1969, pages 357 359. In the second step, an amount of polyamine or polyol chain extender calculated to give an isocyanate hydroxyl or amine mole ratio of about 0.9 1.1 to 1 in the reaction mass, preferably 1.05 to 1, is degassed at about 30 1200C and a pressure of 1333 6666 Pa and quickly added to the reaction mass. The reaction mass is held with stirring at 60 1300C until it is homogeneous, which normally takes 1 5 minutes. The mass is then poured into molds, preferably preheated to 100 1200C, and then cured at about 10d 1200C at a pressure of 1,700 2,200 kilopascals for from 5 minutes to several hours. The casting is then cooled, removed from the mold, aged for about one week at ambient temperature, and is then ready for use. The polyurethanes of this invention can also be made by reaction injection and liquid injection molding techniques, whereby the starting materials are simultaneously injected and mixed in a mold, preferably together with such a conventional polyurethane catalyst as dibutyltin dilaurate or stannous octoate, and then subjected to pressures ranging from ambient to several thousand kilopascals and temperatures ranging from ambient to 1500C. Use of a foaming agent such as a fluorocarbon or water is optional.EXAMPLES In the Examples, all parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 Best Mode A The oligomeric cyclic ether content of a THF EO polymerizate having an EO content of 42 was reduced to 0.75 by treatment with Amberlyste 15 resin.
