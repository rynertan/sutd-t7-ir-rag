# Device for transferring the film holders in a film developer.

## Abstract
Device for transferring the film holders in a film develop er which was described by the Italian patent application n. 45731 A 82 of the same Applicant. Such a device is consti tuted by an arm 1 formed by two rods, a first fixed rod 2 which is applied in the same manner and is actuated by the same means provided to actuate the transferring arm of the above film developer, and a second movable rod 3 which is longitudinally slidable with respect to said fixed rod 2 and may assume two operating positions, a first position in which all the fork elements 21 31 which are arranged on both rods are equally spaced each other, so as to be able to catch a respective film holder 7 and to transfer it for each time in which said arm 1 is actuated. When the second movable rod 3 is shifted in its second operating position, the fork elements 31 which are disposed on said second movable rod 3 are so shifted as to avoid the respective film holders 7 to be caught and transferred, wherein said arm is cyclically actuated within time periods which are submultiple of the time period in which the development stage is carried out. The movable rod 2 is provided with a pin 32 , which bears against a deviation lever 33 having two operating positions when the arm 1 is shifted, in such a manner as to shift said movable rod 2 in its two operating positions.
