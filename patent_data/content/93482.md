## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR E. ORY DEA7ICES This invention relates to semiconductor memory devices and in particular to a sense and latch circuit which can be used as an input buffer for dynamic RM an2om access memory applications. According to the present invention there is provided a sense and latch circuit for dynamic logic applications, comprising a first MOS transistor to whose gate an input voltage is to be applied, a second MOS transistor to whose gate a reference voltage is to be applied, a cross coupled sensing circuit, third and fourthMOS transistors comprising steering transistors for the sensing circuit, and first and second d.c. supply rails for the transistors and the sensing circuit, wherein in use when a sense clock signal is provided the differential gate voltages of the first and second MOS transistors are connected to respective first nodes between the sensing circuit and the steering transistors,. wherein when the differential voltage between the nodes exceeds the threshold voltage of one of the steering transistors the sensing circuit is steered accordingly and an output provided at one of two output nodes of the circuit, and wherein means are proyided for re initialisation after sensing. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a circuit diagram of an input buffer employing the present invention, and Fig. 2 shows the clock and output waveforms for the circuit of Fig. 1 In the circuit of Fig, 1 an input voltage IJP is applied to the gate of an MOS transistor 1 and compared with a reference voltagef applied to the gate of aMOS transistor 2, as described below. The circuit includes first and second d.c. power supply rails VSS and Vcc and twentyone 1 S transistors 1 to 21. Three clock pulses S QR and RH are employed.MOS transistors 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 are used primarily for re initialisation and are controlled by clock signals and RH Reset clock signal R goes low and then sense clock signal S goes high. This then connects the different on resistances, produced by the differential gate voltages of transistors 1 and 2 via MOS transistors 10 and 12, and 11 and 13 respectively to primary sense nodes A and B.Thus a cross coupled sensing circuit comprising MOS transistors 7, 8 and 9 is steered and the differential voltage between nodes A and B amplified. As sensing is performed node C falls, switching off MOS transistors 10 and 11, thus isolating transistors 1 and 2 and allowing the input voltage I P to be changed without affecting the new latched data. When the differential voltage between nodes A and B exceeds VT, the steering transistor threshold voltage, one of the steering transistors, 3 or 4, will turn on pulling down one of the recharged high output nodes O P or O P and removing the gate drive of one of the load pullups comprised by MOS transistors 5 or 6. RH goes low at about this stage according to the clock waveforms shown in Fig. 2.However, in other embodiments RH may be arranged to go low earlier, for example prior to gR The output voltage OJP or OJP is pulled to Vssv having no opposing pull up, while the output voltage O P or OJP is left floating at Vcc. See Fig. 2 . There are several ways to re initialise the circuit, one of which is described below. When S goes low R goes high and transistors 16, 17 and 18 short out at nodes A, B and C, while RH a clock boosted above VCC pulls the outputs O P and O P to VCC via transistors 19 and 20, with transistor 21 shorting O P and O P together. Nodes A, B and C are, therefore, pulled to voltage VCC VT by Dull up transistors 5 and 6. Because nodes D and E are now isolated by MOS transistors 12 and 13 being off, the performance of the circuit may be improved by re initialisina nodes D and E to Vss via the transistors 14 and 15 respectively. This prevents any memory of the previous stage from affecting the set up time of the next operation. The circuit of the present invention compares the input voltage to a reference level and therefore the input threshold is independent of processing. A conventional input buffer circuits for dynamic RAMs employs four clock signals whereas the circuit of the present invention requires only three. In addition the circuit of the present invention provides fast latching of data and fast reinitialisation, as well as providing outputs O P and 0 P.
