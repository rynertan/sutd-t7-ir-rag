# THERMAL MIGRATION PROCESS

## Abstract
A thermal migration process to produce a doped region 6 in a silicon semiconductor body 1 in which a face 8 of the silicon slice 1 having a layer of aluminium 7 is maintained at a temperature just below the eutectic tempera ture. A laser beam 11 is directed onto the opposite face 10 of the slice 1 , locally heating, setting up a thermal gradient through the slice and further heating a small area of the first face above the eutectic temperature. The silicon and alumi nium in that area form a region of molten alloy 7a which migrates through the slice 1 leaving behind it a doped region 6 . Because heating by the laser beam 11 is localised there is no need to deposit the aluminium in the plan of the final doped region 6 so that a uniform layer can be deposited over the whole slice 8 . A finished doped region having, for example, a rectangular grid plan 6, Figure 2b is produced by relative movement of the slice 1 and the laser beam 11 and this movement can be either a con tinuous, smooth and gradual movement to provide for substantially simultaneous movement of the doped region or, it may be a stepped movement providing a stepwise formation.
