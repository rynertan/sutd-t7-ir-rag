## Description
OXYGEN PERMEABLE HARD AND SEMI HARD CONTACT LENS COMPOSITIONS, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION, CONTACT LENSES AND THEIR MANUFACTURE FROM SUCH COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel chemical compounds, polymers made from such compounds and novel materials and products made from such compounds.Important use of the materials made from the invention is the manufacture of corneal contact lenses. In recent years, corneal contact lenses have become more and more popular in the United States and throughout the world. The great popularity of contact lenses is easily understood. One important reason is that such lenses provide correction for the eyes. The lenses fit directly over the eye, and when properly fitted, are easily retained in place. Problems common with spectacles, such as interference with peripheral vision, moving about on the head, discomfort, and the possibility of improper interpupilary distance, are easily overcome. Contact lenses provide cosmetic advantages and afford convenience and increased safety when used in diverse pursuits, particularly sporting events. Now most commonly used contact lenses are generally subdivided into two types, so called hard contact lenses, and soft contact lenses. Each type of lens has its own advantages, but each also includes certain disadvantages. Referring first to the advantages of hard contact lenses, these lenses provide dimensional stability, so that the characteristics of an optical prescription will remain unchanged while the lens is in use in the eye. In some cases, the eye will actually conform to the contour of the lens over a period of time so as to improve the vision of the wearer. Moreover, hard contact lenses are relatively durable in relation to soft lenses. While hard contact lenses have the above and other advantages, some patients find such lenses somewhat uncomfortable in use, and prefer the so called soft contact lens. These lenses fall generally into three categories, namely lenses made from silicone rubber or like materials, lenses made from HEMAw lhydroxyethylmethacrylate or so called hydrogel lenses, and finally, lenses of the methylmethacrylate base type, modified by the addition of polymers such as cellulose acetate butyrate CAB . Soft lenses readily conform to the eye and are quite comfortable in short term use. They are extremely thin as well as soft and pliable. However, they do not provide satisfactory oxygen transmissibility through the lens. Referring now to the disadvantage of both soft and hard contact lenses, neither type of lens is able to be worn by a user over an extended period of time, the cornea becomes irritated or perhaps even damaged.Moreover, the lenses sometime tend to adhere to the eye.of the wearer after being in place for an unduly long period of time, and this can cause discomfort and even damage to the eye. In view of the foregoing advantages of contact lenses, it would be even further advantageous if there were a contact lens that possessed the known advantages of machinability, dimensional stability, toughness and optical clarity, and which were also sufficiently oxygen permeable to be worn by a user for an extended period, such as for several days, weeks, or even months or more.Users of such lenses could wear them for extended periods and still feel comfortable could have good vision and not risk injuring their eyes Contact lenses which could be worn for an extended period would eliminate common problems with existing lenses. The anticipated life of an extended duration contact lens would be lengthened considerably. This is because the requirement for handling would be very greatly reduced. More sturdy lenses, such as known types of hard lenses, are not susceptible to tearing or cracking, but can be s√ßratched by frequent removal and insertion and cleaning, particularly if they are dropped occasionally.using the lenses is a realistic possibility which could be minimized substantially by having lenses which are removed weekly, or monthly, or at greater intervals. Referring now to prior attempts to provide polymers with increased oxygen permeability normally, most or all such known polymers have either been too dimensionally unstable for satisfactory use, or have had other disadvantages. For example, it is known to add significant amounts of additives normally intended to increase wettability. While such materials are helpful in proper amounts, using excess amounts thereof has often tended to cause proteinaceous matter to deposit on and impair the transparency of the inner surface of the lens. While numerous attempts have been made to improve the oxygen permeability of both hard and soft contact lenses, the attempts have met with only limited success, particularly in thicker lens. Moreover, many soft lens material provides an environment which is highlty suitable for bacterial growth, and this calls for sterilization procedures which in turn require the lenses to be handled frequently. The present invention, therefore, is intended from the standpoint of an end use product to provide contact lens materials which are sufficiently oxygen permeable that they may be worn by the user on a greatly extended basis in relation to prior art lenses, which do not have the disadvantages associated with known prior art lenses intended for this purpose. Referring now to its chemical aspects, the invention relates to the manufacture of copolymers of an acrylic or methacrylic material of a known type and novel silicone substituted acrylic or methacrylic compounds so as to produce an oxygen permeable plastic material which is uniquely suitable for manufacturing novel corneal contact lenses as referred to above. The expression copolymers is sometimes used herein for simplicity in referring to a polymer which includes two principal comonomers, although such polymer may incidentally include one or more additional known monomers in minor amounts for purposes such as cross linking, increasing the wettability of the final product, or otherwise. The copolymer compositions and products made therefrom are improved over counterpart prior art compositions by reason of increased dimensional stability and improved gas permeability. Such novel compositions also retain or provide improvements in desirable prior art characteristics such as optical clarity, the ability to be cast, molded and machined, and compatability with chemically bonded, hydrophilic materials adapted to improve the wettability of the finished product. Preferably, the compositions comprise high molecular weight polysiloxanylalkylesters of acrylic and methacrylic acids and other compositions as monomers, copolymerized with methacrylates or other esters of acrylic or methacrylic acids, vinyl carbazole, vinyl benzenes, vinyl pyrrolidinone and itaconate esters. According to the invention, one comonomer the first comonomer is an acrylic or methacrylic ester silane, substituted with one or more highly substituted siloxanyl group. One such typical comonomer is bis trimethylsiloxy methylsiloxanylbis trimethylsilo y methacryloxypropylsilane which can be copolymerized with an alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate, the second comonomer , with this copolymer composition in turn being cross linked to a slight degree by cross linking agents, and preferably further modified by the addition of compounds intended to increase the wettability of the finished copolymer material. This basic polymerization of the novel comonomers with known comonomers occurs through a known double bond polymerization mechanism. A certain proportion, such as 10 to 60 of this compound is then polymerized with one or more or other second comonomer compounds having the same or similar acrylic or methacrylic ester portion, together with the minor amounts of cross linking and wetting agents, referred to above. One more aspect of the present invention relates to the methods of making the so called first or novel comonomers of the invention. According to this method, chlorosilanes are reacted with hydroxy derivatives of polysiloxanyl groups, in the presence of pyridine to bond released hydrochloric acid in the form of precipitated salt of pyridinium hydrochloride at low temperatures. The details of this method are brought out in other portions of the specification. In still another aspect, the invention relates to alternative methods of preparing the above or similar products. One alternative method comprises reacting others, mono ,Si , or methacryloxypropyltrichlorosilanes with an excess of pyridine and reacting the resulting intermediates with polysilanols, pentamethyldisiloxanol, heptamethylisotrisiloxanol 3 hydroxyheptamethyltrisiloxane and trimethylsilanol at about 500C. A monomer is removed from these reaction mixtures by purification following removal of the low molecular weight materials with the reaction products being purified by washing with weak alkalies or like materials. The novel comonomer compounds of the present invention can be represented by the following formulas EMI6.1 where n is an integer 1, 2 or 3, and by EMI6.2 where n is an integer 1, 2 or 3 and by EMI6.3 where n is an integer 1, 2 or 3. In the alkyl or phenyl ester second principal comonomer, the alkyl group contains 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, typically 1 to 6 carbon atoms and the phenyl ester contains a single vinyl benzene, divinyl benzenes, and itaconate esters. One compound which may be used as the first principal comonomer of the present invention is bis trimethylsiloxy methylsiloxanyl bis trimethyl srloxy methacryloxypropylsilane EMI7.1 another compound is bis bis trimethylsiloxy methyl siloxanyl0 trimethylsiloxymethacryloxypropylsilane EMI8.1 One more suitable compound is bis trimethylsiloxy methyl siloxanylmonopentamethyldisiloxanylmonotrimethylsiloxanyl methacryloxypropylsilane EMI8.2 Representative known or second comonomers which may be employed in the practice of the invention include the following methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl acrylate, propyl methacrylate, isopropyl adrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, benzyl acrylate, benzyl methacrylate, phenyl acrylate, phenyl methacrylate, N vinyl carbazole, N vinyl pyrrolidinone, 3 hydroxy 2 naphtyl methacrylate, ethyl vinyl benzene, divinyl benzenes dimethyl itaconate, diphenyl itaconate and dihexylitaconate. Cross linking monomers include difunctional compounds such as ethyl eneglycoldimethacryl ate, diethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, tetraethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, polyethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, divinyl benzene, tetramethyldisiloxanyldi methylmethacrylate and mixtures thereof. The wetting agents include, but are not limited to acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, N vinyl 2 pyrrolidine, and hydroxyalkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, and mixtures thereof. In view of the shortcomings of prior art contact lenses and the compounds and compositions used in making them, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel monomers useful in making improved lens materials, improved polymer compositions made from such novel monomers, and improved lenses made from such polymers. Another object of the invention is to provide novel silicone compounds used as components of polymerizable monomers. And still another object is to provide highly branched or substituted siloxane materials for a variety of uses, including the manufacture of copolymers, terpolymers or other polymers incorporating such materials. A still further object is to provide one or more compounds containing alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acids, and incorporating three polysiloxanylalkyl groups. Another object is to provide an optically useful, novel polymeric material of increased oxygen permeability with respect to prior art compounds. And another object is to provide a composition which will make possible the manufacture of corneal contact lenses which can be worn for an extended time period while providing greatly increased comfort to the wearer. Another object is to provide a polymeric contact lens material which is compatible with additives of known kinds used to provide other desirable end use properties. A still further object is to provide a method of manufacturing copolymers incorporating the compositions made by the novel methods referred to above. These and other objects and advantages of the invention, including those inherent therein, may be achieved in practice by carrying out the methods, and making the compounds and compositions referred to herein. The following examples, which are set forth by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, illustrate preferred methods of carrying the invention into practice. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates a preparation of a new and useful monomer, bis trimethylsiloxanyl bis trimethylsiloxy methylsiloxanylmethacryloxypropylsilane. Tr ichloromethacryloxypropylsilane one mole is dissolved in 700 ml of dry diethylether and placed in a 5 liter, 3 necked, round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and an additional funnel. The solution is cooled down to 500C with a dry ice isopropanol cooling bath. When the temperature has reached 500C, 280 grams slight excess of dry pyridine is added over a period of about 2 hours, with the temperature being held at 500C or less during pyridine addition. At the same temperature, two moles of trimethylsilanol and one mole of heptamethylisotrisiloxanol 3 hydroxyheptamethyitrisiloxane , which are prepared by known methods in the art, is added in a diethylether solvent, forming a white precipitate of pyridinium hydrochloride. When all the mixtures of the silanols have been added, the temperature of the reaction mixture is increased rapidly to about 300C and stirred for 1 2 hour. The pyridinium hydrochloride is isolated by filtration and the filter cake is washed with diethyl ether. The crude monomer bis trimethylsiloxanyl bis trimethylsiloxy methylsiloxanylmethacryloxypropylsilane in diethyl ether is washed twice with water 200 ml each .The upper organic layer is then separated and diethylether is removed by means of distillation. The crude monomer I is washed with 150 ml of distilled water, and thereafter twice with a dilute sodium bicarbonate solution, again with distilled water once, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 2 hours. The dried monomer is purified by distilling off all low boiling materials at 850C and 0.1 mm Hg pressure. The purified monomer is refrigerated until used. Density of the monomer I is 0.98 g ml at 200C and n2D5 1.4153 0.0010. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates a preparation of a new and useful monomer, bis bis trimethylsiloxy methylsiloxanyl monotrirnethylsiloxanylmethacryloxypropylsilane. One mole of trimethoxymethacryloxypropylsilane 248.0 g. , one mole of acetoxytrimethylsilane and two moles of 3 acetoxyheptamethyltrisiloxane are mixed together in a 2 liter, 3 necked, round bottom, flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an additional funnel. The mixture is cooled to less than lO0C by an ice cooling bath. 57.0 grams of aqueous ethanoic sulfuric acid are added to the reaction mixture over a period of 70 minutes. Then the temperature is slowly increased to room temperature, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 16 hours The aqueous layer which separates is removed and discarded. The organic layer is washed twice with 300 ml. of distilled water, and thereafter twice with a dilute sodium bicarbonate solution, again with distilled water once, and then dried over magnesium sulfate anhydrous for 2 hours. The dried monomer is purified by distilling off all low boiling materials at 800C and 0.1 mm Hg pressure. The purified monomer is refrigerated until used. Density of the monomer II is 0.965 g ml at 250C. EXAMPLE 3 This example illustrates the preparation of a representative oxygen permeable copolymer. A mixture of 38 parts of the comonomer I ofExample 1, 57 parts of methyl methacrylate, 3 parts of methacrylic acid and 2 parts of triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate and 0.14 by weight of the entire mixture of t butyl peroxypivalate is placed in a glass dish or tube and then placed in a vacuum oven which has been purged with nitrogen. The oven is closed and the temperature is maintained at 480C for 24 hours.The monomers react to create a copolymer plastic which is hard, colorless, transparent and rigid. The oxygen permeability is 18.0 X l011 cm2 sec ml O2 ml X mm Hg .The oxygen permeability of a disc of polymethylmethacrylate, measured in the same way is less 0.2 X 10 11 same units . EXAMPLE 4 This example illustrates the preparation of a representative oxygen permeable copolymer from another comonomer III . A mixture of 35 parts of novel comonomer III , which can be that, prepared by the chemistry described in Example 1 or 2 , 50 parts of methyl methacrylate, 10 parts of cyclohexyl methacrylate, 2 parts of n vinyl pyrrolidone and 3 parts of triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate and 0.25 by weight of the entire composition of t butyl peroxydecanoate is polymerized in a polypropylene dish or tube at 500C for 24 hours. The resulting copolymer plastic material is machined, cut, polished, and finished into a concavoconvex lens of 0.10 mm thickness. The oxygen permeability of this lens is 26.6 X 10 11 cm2 sec ml 02 ml X mm Hg . The following Examples 5 10 illustrate the conditions of preparation and properties of copolymers which contain varying proportions of the novel comonomer 11 of Example 2 when such comonomers are reacted with one or more of the following compounds methyl methacrylate MMA , cyclohexyl methacrylate CHMA , methacrylic acid MAA , n vinyl pyrrolidone NVP , triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate Tri EGDMA , tetraethyleneglycoldimethacrylate TEGDMA , ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate EGDMA . The siloxane comonomer used in these examples is that prepared in Example 2, namely, bistbis trimethyl siloxy methylsiloxanyl monottrimethylsiloxanyl methacryl oxypropylsilane and which is abbreviated in the table below as C II . The polymerization is conducted in polypropylene tubes for 24 hours at the temperature shown in the table. The table also shows the composition of each form of polymer, and the temperature at which polymerization took place. The properties of the polymer are abbreviated in the right hand corner, with the meanings of the abbreviations appearing below. In the examples, the principal polymers are C II and MMA, with the compositions including one or more other compounds as indicated. MAA provides wettability,CHMA supplements the MMA to accomplish better rigidity, and NVP provides increased wettability, except that, where more than 4 or 5 NVP is present, a portion thereof serves as a third monomer. The TEGDMA, Tri EGDMA, andEGDMA are crosslinking agents.

EXAMPLE 11 This example illustrates the preparation and properties of a wettable, oxygen permeable polymer. A disc is prepared in the manner described in Example 4 from a mixture of 40 parts of the monomer I , Example 1, 40 parts of methyl methacrylate, 4 parts of methacrylic acid and 16 parts of dimethyl itaconate, using t butylperoxypivalate as a catalyst. The polymerization is carried out at 480C for 24 hours. The resulting disc is colorless, transparent, hard and rigid. The oxygen permeability Dk value of the polymer is 15.3 X l011 cm2 sec ml 02 ml X mm Hg . In this example, no difunctional cross linking agent was used. EXAMPLE 12 This example illustrates the preparation of a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and the mixture of novel comonomers, I and II , 50 50, referred to in Example 1 and 2. A cylindrical plug of the copolymer is prepared by polymerizing a mixture of 40 parts of such novel comonomers, 50 parts of methyl methacrylate, 4 parts ofNVP and 6 parts of divinyl benzene, in the presence of t butylperoxydecanoate at 450G. The polymer plastic is hard, rigid, and highly oxygen permeable in relation to prior art material. The previous examples illustrate the outstanding properties of the resulting polymers of this invention.In great measure these properties are attributed to the novel comonomers Other additives to the polymers of this invention as known in the art can be made. In all cases, the polymers are optically clear and transparent and meet required standards of desirable high oxygen permeability in semi rigid and rigid contact lenses. Even though I have described specific examples of this invention, there are many variations possible within the scope of keeping the physical properties as previously described. Such variations include the use of mixtures of monomers within the components to comprise of the required parts of each. For example, two or more siloxanyl alkyl ester comonomers can be used instead of a single such comonomer for the component of the composition. Respectively, two or more cross linking agents can be used. Other additives to the copolymers such as colorants, tints and like materials may also be employed within the scope of normal ranges of this invention.
