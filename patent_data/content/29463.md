An experimented sample of the invention has been prepared, and by actual operation it has been found to be very convenient and accurate.An embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings in connection with a guitar chords slide rule in accordance with the invention and in which Fig. 1 is a pictorial projection illustration of one embo diment of the invention,Fig. 2 is a graphic illustration of C chord in C key of the invention, andFig. 3 is a graphic illustration of F chord in C key of the invention.The slide rule has a main rule 1, a slide rule 7, andscme chord finger position transparent sheets 13. The main rule 1 has two U type grooves 8, one for the slide rule 7, the other for chord finger position transparent sheet 13.Two equal graduations of key scales 2 or 3,4 are printed on the flanges of the main rule 1. One is marked with twelve chromatic scales in alphabetic notation called major key scales 3 Fig. 2 , such as C, Cf, Db , D,A, At, Bb , B, etc the other is marked witi minor m scales 4 also in alphabetic notation, such as Cm, C m,... Atm, r Bbm , Bm ... etc. and C key graduation MAJOR is set to align the Am MINOR graduation and so on Fig.2 thus providing a graphic contrast of major to its relative minor key.Said main rule 1 is printed at its inner bottom with a six strings fingerboard diagram 5, each distance of fret designed just the same as said key scales 2 graduation, each fret neans for a difference of half note. In accordance with the arrangement of notes on the guitar, said six strings fingerboard diagram 5 is marked with natural numerical notes 22 such as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 , which are arranged by means of inserting said slide rule 7 into theU type grooves 8 on the main rule 1. Said slide rule 7 has a fingerboard diagram displaying window 9, and an open string notes displaying window 10 which is in connection with a key index 11 on both sides.The key index 11 is set to align to C or Am graduation on the key scales 2 the slide rule xemains at same position , then said open string notes displaying window 10 shows the reading 3 6 2 5 7 3 six open string notes in C or Am key . Meanwhile said fingerboard diagram displaying window 9 shows the complete notes of the fingerboard upon said fingerboard diagram 5 in which notes are arranged according to the principles of natural scale. Means for the notes of 3 mi , 4 fa and 7 Ti , 1 Do has a difference.of one fret distance a semitone and the rest of each contiguous note on each string has a difference of two fret one note .Thus, if said key index 11 is displaced on the slide rule with D major or Bm minor on the key scale 3,4, then the movement is maintained in exactly the same proportion as said key scales relative to the notes on the fingerboard diagram, complete notes on fingerboard inD or Bm key thus being provided, and so on, so that a complete notes position on the guitar can be obtained in any twelve kinds of major minor keys respectively.Said key scales 3,4, showing the graduation, have equal distances and are marked with chromatic scales. Therefore, wherever the key index 11 points to any key scales 2 then the alphabetic name of tonic 1 Do is at this key scale, e.g. in C key the tonic 1 Do at C scale, super tonic 2 Re at D scale medient 3 Mi at E scale subdominant 4 Fa at F scale dominant 5 So at G scale submedient 6 La at A scale and leadingtone 7 Ti at B scale, so that each numerical note in natural scale 6 is provided respectively on said slide rule 7. Furthermore, in accordance with the principle of composing chords and naming the chords, each natural note has a root of chords, then the name of the chord is the same as the fixed alphabetic name of the root notes, e.g. in any major key the tonic note 1 po has a root to compose tonic chords 1 3 5 , a principle of triad and so on subdominant chords 4 6 1 , dominant seventh chords 5 7 2 4 and in minor key has minor tonic chords 6 1 3 minor subdominant chords 2 4 6 and minor dominant seventh chords 3 5 1 ...etc.A set of each of said composing notes of common used chords is provided beside said numerical natural scale 6 on said slide rule 7, Fig. 2 and a set of common used chords in major key is placed at the left hand of said numerical natural scales 6, and at the right hand for the minor keys chords which is called a chords composing notation scales 12. Therefore, common used chords in C key can be read asC 1 3 5 Dm 2 4 6 Em 3 5 7 F 4 6 1 G7 5 7 2 4 Am 6 1 3 Bdim 7 2 4 . A small letter m marked on said chords composing notation scales 12 is an indication of minor chords, such as D m Dm D minor chord etc.A small letter 7 is for seventh chords such as C Accord ing to demand, said chords composing notation scales 12 can be enlarged for application to compose a seventh chords C7 ninth chdrds cog augmented C diminished C and C sus Csue chords etc. so that during practical operation, for demands twelve kinds of major minor keys of its basic common used chords can be obtained by means of reading the chords composing notation scales 12.According to this embodiment of the invention at the present stage it is merely necessary to displace said slide rule once to provide 1 A graphic synopsis for major key to relative minor key.2 Complete notes on guitar fingerboard in twelve kinds of major minor keys and the notes position.3 Chords name for common used in twelve kinds of major minor keys.4 Chords composing notation scales for basic use in twel ve kinds of major minor keys and naming of the chords.5 A graphic synopsis for natural numercial notation to relative fixed alphabet notation in twelve kinds of major minor keys.6 Further characteristic is according to the composing notes in each section of a song to compose possible chords and follow the chords composing notation sca les 12 accordingly to obtain the chords name, so that it provides a guide for chords arrangement and for the equivalent chords in another tone.Furthermore, aforesaid main rule 1 has a lower groove 8 for inserting three or more chord finger position transparent sheets 13 located between the said main rule 1 and slide rule 7 along the groove 8 the transparent sheets 13 have some finger position marks 14 printed thereon which indicate the position of the fingers, and are according to the composition principle of chords which are based on a triad relationship so that a chord could be a major, minor, augmented, diminished or. a seventh chord.Therefore, in general, a chord is composed by three notes, so that the embodiment of the invention uses three transparent sheets as a unit, in which a main sheet 13a is marked with a chords scale 15 which follows the order of chromatic scale Fig. 2 , the same as said key scale 3, and the chords scale 15 are set to display through a chords name display window 16 on said slide rule 7.
