## Description
This invention relates generally to apparatus for sensing and measuring changes in inclination, and more particularly to electronic apparatus for providing a digital readout of a capacitive inclination sensor. Apparatus employed in the prior art for sensing and measuring changes in inclination and providing a digital readout therefor have generally relied on a bubble level type sensor of the type having an arcuate glass chamber enclosing an electrolyte with electrodes immersed therein so that an inclination of the sensor results in a change in resistance between the electrodes. By sensing the resultant change in magnitude and direction of inclination with appropriate phase and amplitude sensitive circuitry, a very high degree of sensitivity may be provided so that very small changes in inclination can be measured with high precision. One apparatus of this type is described in U.S. A 4,167,818 and a further such device is disclosed in U.S. A 4,377,912. However, these prior art devices depend on electrolytic levels which employ precious metal electrodes and are inherently expensive to fabricate and calibrate. Furthermore, the circuitry required to attain a digital readout is complex and expensive, and heretofore has neither allowed a user to choose between alternate readout units, depending on his application, nor to preselect a zero reference which differs from the earth s gravity vector for convenience in measuring a change in inclination of a tilted surface. The apparatus of U.S. A 4,377,912 provides a sensor which presents a capacitance which is a function of its inclination. The capacitor is used as an element of an oscillator whereby a change in capacitance varies the oscillator frequency which in turn may be applied to control an indicating instrument. However, an apparatus of this type suffers from instability and temperature drift due to its analogue nature and therefore is unsuitable for precision measurements of high stability. The present apparatus is intended for use with a digital interface, of the type described in Applicants co pending European Patent Application No. 86.300271.3. The detector described therein provides a pulsed output, wherein the pulse width is a function of the inclination of a variable capacitance sensor, and which is adaptable to an all digital readout apparatus. Thus, the instability and sensitivity to environmental changes of the prior art are readily overcome. The present invention is defined in the appended claims and provides an inclination sensor with digital readout which permits the user to choose between multiple readout units, for example degrees and mils, in ft and percentage grade. Further features include the capability to select any preset angle as a zero reference, and the capability to hold any reading displayed for any desired period of time. An overrange indicator is actuated when the linear range of the sensor has been exceeded. In particular, the digital display apparatus of the present invention is adapted for use with a gravitational sensor providing pulse signals which correspond to the direction or algebraic sign and the magnitude of inclination of the sensor with respect to a reference axis. The system includes a clock pulse generator for providing timing signals, and responds to the sensor output by providing a gating pulse which is representative of the magnitude of inclination and signals representative of the direction of inclination. A digital counting circuit counts the number of clock pulses occurring during a period determined by the width of the gating pulse and the period of the clock pulses is selected to provide a predetermined scale factor so that the digital count signal is representative of the gate pulse width and the clock repetition rate. A reference offset angle may be inserted by storing angle data in a memory. This stored data is used to generate a correction factor signal to adjust the digital count signal such that the difference between the sensed angle and the offset angle is displayed. This is accomplished by an up down counter which receives the uncorrected digital count signals and the correction factor signals to provide a digital count signal which represents the angular difference between the sensor inclination and the reference offset. The digital output signals are incremented or decremented according to a signal representing the algebraic sign of inclination, derived from the sensor pulse widths and applied to gate the up down counter accordingly. The resulting digital count signal and sign signal are used to energise a display driver for actuating a digital display. Digital display apparatus in accordance with the present invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the invention for processing output signals of an inclination sensor 20 and sensor interface 22. Electrical signals from the inclination sensor 20 proportional to the direction and magnitude of an inclination angle are processed in the interface 22 to generate pulse width modulated signals accordingly. The sensor 20, interface 22, and a display 40 form no part of the invention and are shown here for illustrative purposes only. An oscillator 24 generates a pulse train at a rate proportional to a desired scale factor of the display. A timer 28 generates a trigger pulse which is applied to the interface 22. The oscillator 24 senses the interface signals and generates a gating pulse which is applied to an angle generator 30 for a time proportional to the width of the applied interface pulses. The train of pulses is counted in the angle generator 30 and a signal representative of the pulse count is applied in digital form to a display driver decoder 34 which actuates the liquid crystal elements of the display 40. The apparatus includes an offset angle memory 32 for correcting the display for any predetermined angular disposition or the sensor 20. A circuit 36 receives the sensor pulses to provide output signals indicative of the sign of the angle of inclination, thereby commanding the angle generator 30 to increment or decrement its count. Other features include an overrange circuit 26 for blanking the display when a predetermined linear angular range has been exceeded. An observed reading may be latched into the display 40 by a hold reading circuit 44. A detector 38 provides a display indication when the life of an internal battery has been expended. Since the invention employs digital circuitry, logic circuit 50 sets and resets the various circuits automatically upon initial application of power. Control means 42 actuates the hold reading mode and control means 46 permits selection of the normal mode, set mode for inputting an angular offset of the sensor, and alternate reference mode for reading the difference angle. A scale factor switch 48 transposes the LCD display between the optional scale factors. Figure 2 represents typical electrical signals produced by the sensor interface 22 for representative angular dispositions of the sensor 20. The interface 22 produces two output pulses, PW1 and PW2, whose duration is representative of the inclination of the sensor 20. As the inclination of the sensor 20 changes, a train of pulse width modulated pulses appears at the interface output terminals. The modulated pulses are phase synchronised with respect to each other as illustrated in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2A, when the sensor axis is symmetrically aligned with respect to the earth s gravitational vector, i.e. displaced at O Also shown in Figure 2 is a signal ΔP, which represents the difference in duration of pulses PW1 and PW2. Since in Figure 2A the pulses have equal duration, the value of ΔP is zero throughout the cycle. The difference pulse ΔP will be used to generate a gating pulse in a manner to be described for application to a digital counter for generating signals corresponding to the angular inclination of the sensor 20. As can be seen from Figure 2B, when the sensor 20 is inclined at an angle of 45 The input portion of the circuit of the invention is depicted in Figure 3. An exclusive OR gate 212 has two inputs connected to receive the pulse width modulated signals PW1 and PW2 from the sensor 20 to generate the difference pulse ΔP. The two pulses are also applied to the sign of angle generator 36 via lines 250,252, as will be described in connection with Figure 5. The output of gate 212 is applied to an inverter 214 to provide an exclusive NOR of signals PW1 and PW2. This signal comprises the difference pulse width which is used as a gating signal on a line 258 which ranges from O ms at zero inclination to approximately 4 ms at 45 In order to maximise flexibility in application, the system is capable of providing an output scale in degrees, mils, inch per foot in ft , grade and mm M. The scale factor is established by the frequency of a crystal oscillator X1 and a circuit which permits deriving two scale factors therefrom. The system may optionally be provided with a second crystal oscillator circuit X2, Figure 4 from which an additional two scale factors may be derived. The unused crystal input may be disabled so that effectively only one crystal oscillator is operative. For readings in degrees and mils, a 1.8 MHz quartz crystal is utilised. The crystal X1, a resistor R4, capacitors C4 and a inverter 202 comprise a simple feedback oscillator. The output of the inverter 202 is buffered through series connected inverters 204 and 206 to provide a clock pulse to frequency dividers 208 and 210. The divider 208 is comprised of a presettable up down counter in the form of a commercially available integrated circuit chip. Also, the divider 208 is programmed by standard techniques to be preset to provide a division of 16 by connecting the preset input terminals PO P3 and C The divider 210 is similarly a presettable divide by N counter configured to provide a divider ratio of 9 in conjunction with an AND gate 228. The output terminal Q5 of the divider 210 is coupled to an inverter 230 to provide an output frequency of 200 KHz. The outputs of the inverters 232 and 230 are coupled to an OR gate 234, whereupon the one of the two divider outputs activated is provided at the gate output on a line 262 as an angle clock signal appropriately scaled for the selected units display. A switch S2 is used to select the readout units and is shown for convenience as a double pole, normally open switch. A voltage V is applied through a resistor R3 to the R terminal of an R S latch 218 and through an inverter 216 to the S terminal. When the momentary switch S2 is depressed and released, the d.c. voltage across a capacitor C3 is momentarily short circuited, bringing the R input of the latch 218 to ground and the S input to a logic high. This results in providing a clock pulse to a flip flop 220. On power up, a reset pulse on a line 266 is applied to the terminal R of the flip flop 220, which sets the output Q. The logic high applied to the reset terminal of the divider 210 disables the divider output Q5. The logic high output Q of the flip flop 220 is also applied to an inverter 226 and brings the reset terminal to a logic low, thus enabling the divider 208. The output CO of the latter is applied to an inverter 232 and then to one terminal of an OR gate 234. Since the input frequency is 1.8 MHz, division by 16 results in an output frequency of 112.5 KHz. This represents the frequency needed for the unit to provide an output reading in degrees, as will be shown below. Returning now to the flip flop 220, when a clock pulse is applied to terminal CK thereof from the latch 218, the outputs Q and In a similar manner, it will be shown that by appropriate choice of the oscillator frequency and divider ratios, the system may be adapted to select between a display of in ft and grade. As will be shown in connection with Figure 4, the output on line 262 of the gate 234 is provided to an OR gate 602 for one of two scale factor oscillators and associated dividers preselected by hardwiring to provide the desired display units on the LCD. The outputs Q and The decimal point drivers are also used to energise the indicator annunciator legends. In the in ft mode, the decimal point DP2 below the in ft symbol is illuminated, and there are two digits to the right of the decimal. In the DEG mode and grade mode the decimal point DP3 falls below the grade indicator and there is one digit to the right of the decimal point. In the mils and mm M modes, no decimal point will be illuminated. Since the XOR gate 222 Figure 3 is coupled at its inputs to the 96 Hz backplane pulse BP2 and to the Q output of the flip flop 220, DP2, line 254 will be pulsed at a 96 Hz rate in phase with BP2 when the Q output is held at a logic low and 180 The liquid crystal display 40 is comprised of a conductive backplane which is excited by an a.c. reference signal. Conductive elements connected to terminals are sandwiched above the backplane, with a liquid electrolyte therebetween. When an a.c. signal out of phase with the referenced signal is applied to a terminal, the corresponding element is illuminated. Figure 9 shows how backplane reference signals 154 and 156 are generated. The voltages to drive the conductive elements are derived by phase inverting the reference signal. See, for example, the low battery circuit 38 of Figure 8. A signal 156 is applied through a control gate 504 and coupled through an inverter 506 to illuminate the LO BATT element. Similarly, the DP2 and the DP3 signals on lines 254 and 256 of Figure 3 may be phase inverted in a gate circuit, as shown in Figure 8 at gates 526 and 528, and described in detail hereinafter. It will be clear to one skilled in the art that by hardwiring the DP2 and DP3 signals to appropriate electrodes of the LCD, the LCD display 40 may be individually adapted to a desired display configuration. The electrodes which are desired to remain inactive are wired to the reference backplane, not shown. Thus, for the mils degree display, the mils legend of Figure 5 will be driven by the output of DP2. The DEG legend and associated decimal point will be illuminated when driven by a signal from DP3. The unused indicators may be hardwired to the backplane reference, and thus inactivated. In the configuration providing in ft and grade displays, the left most decimal point and the in ft legend will be simultaneously illuminated by signal DP2, while the grade and associated decimal point will be illuminated when energised by the signal DP3. In a third configuration, in which the in ft and mm M scale factors are utilised, the in ft legend will be illuminated along with the associated decimal point thereunder by the signal from DP2, while the mm M legend will be illuminated along with the right most decimal point by the signal from DP3. It may be seen from Figure 3 that the difference signal applied by the inverter 214 to dividers 208 and 210 will enable the dividers for a period of time proportional to the difference between the sensor output pulses PW1 and PW2. Thus, for the 1.8 MHz oscillator, a series of output pulses is provided at the OR gate 234 which is representative of the angular displacement of the sensor in either degrees or mils as determined by operation of the switch S2. Referring now to Figure 4, with continued reference to Figure 3, a select units control signal from terminal Q of the flip flop 220 is also applied via a line 264 to the input of an inverter 618 and to a divider 620 of divider network 606. An alternate scale factor clock B operating with a crystal frequency of 2.574 MHz provides an angle clock signal 630 to an OR gate 602 in in ft or grade. The crystal X2 in combination with capacitors C9, resistor R13, and an inverter 608 comprises a 2.564 MHz oscillator. The output of an inverter 608 is buffered through inverters 610 and 612 to provide a clock signal to dividers 614,616,620 and 622. Any one of various commercially available programmable counters are suitable for the dividers. When enabled by the difference pulse on line 258 to terminal PE, cascaded dividers 614 and 616 will generate a 234 KHz output signal which is applied to an inverter 626. Similarly, cascaded dividers 620 and 622 will provide a 198 KHz output pulse to an inverter 624. Since the outputs of the inverters 624 and 626 are coupled to the inputs of an OR gate 628, an angle clock signal representing the in ft scale at 234 KHz or the grade scale at 198 KHz will be coupled on a line 630 to the OR gate 602. As in the discussion with respect to the scale factor clock of Figure 3, the switch S2 will provide a select units pulse on the line 264 to energise one of the two available angle clock frequencies by providing a set or reset signal in complementary fashion to the dividers 614 and 620. The selected clock signal will then be available at the input of the OR gate 602, as well as a degree mils clock signal on the line 262. In the system described, no software switch is provided to select between the outputs of the gates 234 and 628. Therefore, one of the crystal oscillators must be disabled, such as by grounding the crystal terminals, which selection is made by considering the intended application of the instrument and installing the desired modification during assembly. The output of the OR gate 602 is coupled on line 352 to the angle generator 30 whose function will now be described with reference to Figure 6. The angle generator 30 is comprised of counter elements 308,310,312 and 314, which provide a thirteen bit, up down, decade counter with reset and preset capabilities. Each counter element includes an up down input terminal and counts in a direction determined by the logic level of the signal applied thereto. In the normal and set offset modes, the angle generator counter always counts up. For the offset mode, the direction of count is determined by a comparison of the sign of the offset angle with the sign of the new angle with respect to the earth s gravity vector. This count may be up, down, or a combination of up and down sequences. A clock pulse applied to the CK terminal by the angle clock signal on a line 352 serves to increase or decrease the count existing in the counter depending upon the logic level at the up down terminals when the clock pulse occurs. In this manner, the count increases for one direction of inclination of the sensor 20, and decreases for the opposite direction of inclination of the sensor. When it is desired to measure the inclination of the sensor 20 with respect to a predetermined offset angle, a load offset pulse on the line 166 is applied to the PL terminals to enable a preset count to be loaded into the counters 308,310,312 and 314. The offset count signals are parallel loaded into terminals PO P3 from the offset angle memory 32 in a manner to be described. A clear signal CLR 1 is applied to the reset terminals of each counter to reset the counter to zero at the start of each count cycle. The outputs from terminals OO 03 of the counter elements are aplied to a multiplexer 302 and will ultimately be applied to drive the LCD. The output OO from the counter element 314 is used to energise the most significant bit MSB of the LCD, which appears as a vertical bar in Figure 5. The output signals from all counter elements are also applied to offset angle memory 32 via lines 384 399. A multiplexer 302 is comprised of three two line to one line data selectors 316,318,320 each of which routes one of two four bit signals representative of the angle count and overrange indication applied to the inputs to a four bit output. Inputs AO A3 are coupled to receive the angle count of the respective counters 308,310,312 and 314. Inputs BO B3 are connected to a logic high. The strobe input D S is grounded to enable the device. Terminals DO D3 provide the four bit output signal. The count appearing at terminals DO D3 is then coupled to a decoder driver 304 and latched into seven segment display drivers 322,324 and 326 on occurrence of a latch display data pulse on line 168 applied to the latch terminal L of the decoders. The decoders 322 326 preserve the count until updated on the following count cycle. The decoders 322 326 must be capable of a storage latch function and of accepting a four bit input signal for energising a seven segment LCD display. The latched section, for example, may be comprised of RS flip flops, while the decoder section may use a read only memory with the binary input acting as an address. The word stored in memory is then the equivalent of the seven segment display. The decoder outputs 384 a u are coupled to the LCD segments of Figure 5 in a conventional manner. A suitable decoder driver chip for this application is the RCA CD 4056A DE. Other integrated circuits with similar properties may also be utilised. Figure 6 also shows the circuitry for driving the MSB and minus sign elements. The MSB, shown as the numeral 1 in Figure 5, and the minus sign are latched at the same time by D flip flops 328 and 330 on receipt of the latch data display pulse 168. Thus, the flip flop 328 is enabled at the time the seven segment display of the LCD is energised. A data signal is provided by the OO output of the counter 314 when the count exceeds the 3 digit range of the seven segment digital displays. When data signal OO is high, the flip flop 328 will be triggered by the clock signal applied to input CK resulting in a logic high at the Q output. The Q output is coupled to one input of exclusive OR gate 332, while the backplane 2 signal is coupled on line 156 to a second input of the gate. Since the backplane 2 signal on line 156 is pulsing at a 96 Hz rate, the output of the XOR gate 332 will also pulse at 96 Hz the signal phase will be controlled by the Q output of the flip flop 328. A logic high at the Q output will result in a 18O The D flip flop 330 and XOR gate 334 operate in a similar manner. A minus sign data signal is applied on line 348 from the sign of the angle generator 36 to the flip flop 330, a logic high signifying a minus condition. The clock signal on line 168 triggers the Q output during the presence of the minus sign high on terminal D. The signal from the Q output and the backplane 2 signal coupled to respective inputs of the XOR gate 334 which is then coupled to activate the minus sign indicator of the LCD when the output of the gate 334 is out of phase with respect to BP2, and extinguish the minus sign when the output is in phase with BP2. If the signal on line 350 is a logic high, indicating that the linear range of the sensor has been exceeded, multiplexer data selectors 316,318 and 320 will output an all ONES count to the seven segment display drivers 322,324 and 326, which forces the LCD into a blank condition, indicating to the user that the sensor 20 is in an overrange condition. Referring now to Figure 7, the offset angle memory 32 comprises an angle data store for receiving signals representative of an offset angle and applying those signals to increment or decrement the angle generator count. A switch S3 allows the user to select between three modes of operation. Before depressing the switch S3, the apparatus is in the normal mode. In this mode, the angular displacement of the sensor 20 is measured with respect to the earth s gravity vector, i.e. the true vertical. When the switch S3 is depressed and released to obtain the set offset mode, an existing value displayed on the LCD will be stored into offset latches 402,404 and 406. When the switch S3 is again depressed and released, the apparatus is placed in the offset mode. The value previously stored in the memory is then loaded into the angle generator 30 as a preset value with the result that the LCD displays the difference between the present inclination of the sensor and the previously stored offset value. In general, the switch S3 serves to generate a clock pulse to trigger the counter 418 each time the switch is depressed and released. The counter 418 then sequentially cycles the select mode circuit 46 through the normal, set offset, offset, and back to normal modes for each successive operation of the switch S3. In the normal mode, the R terminal of an RS flip flop 416 is high and the S terminal is low. The O output is low, thus there is a logic low at the clock input of the counter 418 which is a conventional counter with preset, reset and up down counting capabilities as previously described. Since the counter 418 is reset upon initial application of power, the output is a binary word OO1, corresponding to the state of terminals PO P2. An inverter 422 coupled to the OO terminal of the counter 418 provides a logic low to an AND gate 426, while output O1 provides a logic low to a second input of the AND gate 426, hence the offset latch pulse enable is at a logic low. Further, the logic high output from the inverter 422 when applied through an inverter 424 and the logic low from terminal O1 of the counter 418 to an AND gate 428 result in a similar manner in a logic low on offset load enable line 382. Therefore, the offset load enable line is also disabled. When the switch S3 is depressed for the set offset mode, the flip flop 416 is set and provides a logic high at the CK input of the counter 418. The counter 418 is incremented and provides a binary word output of 010. Since the input to the AND gate 426 is now 1,1, the offset latch pulse on line 381 is enabled. The input to the AND gate 428 being 0,1, the offset load enable line remains inactive. The offset latch pulse enable signal is thereafter coupled to the AND gate 132, as shown in Figure 9. The offset latch pulse developed on line 170 is then received as a clock pulse at the latches 402,404, and 406 so that the values coupled to the latched inputs are thereby stored as displayed on the LCD. When the switch S3 is again activated to obtain the offset mode, the clock pulse to the counter 418 advances the output count to binary word 011. This count turns off the offset latch pulse gate 426 and enables the offset load gate 428 to provide the offset load enable pulse on line 382 to the gate 124, all as shown in Figure 9. The load offset pulse thereby generated by the D flip flop 122 parallel loads the values previously latched into the offset latches 402,404 and 406 into the angle generator 30 when the offset load enable signal is high. Simultaneously, the logic high at terminal 02 is coupled to the OR gate 420 and applies a logic high to the parallel load terminal PL. This resets the counter 418 by transferring the values loaded into PO P3 to terminals 00 02 to reset the counter to the normal state on the next clock pulse from the switch S3. Referring now to the sign of the angle generator 36, the sensor interface signals PW1 and PW2 are coupled to the inputs of an R S flip flop 432 of which the Q output is connected to the data input of a type D flip flop 434, which receives the ofset latch pulse on line 170 as a clock pulse. The Q output of the flip flop 432 is coupled to an inverter 442 which feeds the Y2, Y3 inputs of a four input to one output multiplexer 446. The Q output of the flip flop 434 provides an inverse sign signal to termianl YO of the multiplexer 446 and is also coupled to the inverter 440 to provide a non inverted sign of the angle to terminal Y1. The Y output of the multiplexer 446 provides the sign of the angle or minus signal to line 348. In the normal mode and set offset mode the sign of the angle is detected by the R S flip flop 432, which compares PW1 on line 250 and PW2 on line 252 from the sensor 20 to determine which pulse width remains high for the longest period of time see Figure 2 . If PW1 is high longer than PW2, which occus when the inclination angle is positive, then R 1 and S 0 and Q output will be zero. If PW2 has a greater pulse width than PW1, which occurs with a negative angle of inclination, then R 0 and S 1, resulting in a logic high at the Q output. But the Q output of the flip flop 432 is coupled through the inverter 442 to the multiplexer 446. Since the Q output is inverted, the minus sign signal on line 348 ultiplexers, the result is that in normal mode B is always set at a logic high. Similarly, in the set offset mode, terminal B remains at a logic high. Terminal A is driven by a The logic of the multiplexers 446 and 444 is so arranged that in the normal and set offset modes, the sign signal coupled from the inverter 442 to terminals Y2,Y3 of the multiplexer 446 will be coupled to the Y output and appear on line 348. In the offset mode, terminal B is brought to a logic low by virtue of the logic high applied to the input of the inverter 430. In that condition, the sign of the angle displayed is determined by the signal appearing at terminal Y1 which is coupled to output Y. The output of The OR gate 408 provides a logic low output in the all zero s condition. The output of the gate 408 is coupled to the inverter 410 and provides a clock pulse to the D flip flop 412. The The up down signal 354 is generated by the D flip flop 434, the XOR gate 436, the inverter 438, and the multiplexer 444. The up down signal 354 controls the direction of counting for the angle generator 30 Figure 6 . In the normal and set offset mode, the output X is coupled to X2 or X3, since B is a logic high, and the up down signal is always logic high, thereby commanding the angle generator counter to increment. In the offset mode, the signal up down is derived by comparing the sign of the offset angle previously latched in the flip flop 434 with the sign of the new angle with respect to earth s gravity vector at the XOR gate 436. If the signs are the same, the up down signal is held at logic low resulting in decrementing the angle counter, unless an all zeros condition is detected, in which case the signal is brought to a logic high directing the angle counter 30 to increment. If the comparison detects that the sign of the two angles is opposite, then the up down signal is switched to logic high, providing an incrementing count. The sign of the offset angle, which is derived from the flip flop 432 in a manner previously described, is latched into the flip flop 434 by the offset latch pulse on line 170. Thus, the sign of the offset angle appears at terminal Q of the flip flop 434 and one input terminal of the XOR gate 436 and the inverse sign is coupled to X1 of the multiplexer 444 through the inverter 438. On activation of the offset mode, the new angular information on lines 250 and 252 is detected by the flip flop 432 and coupled to a second input of the XOR gate 436. The output of gate 436 is coupled to terminal X1 of the multiplexer 444. The signal is also inverted in the inverter 438 and coupled to terminal XO. In the normal and set offset mode, the signal at terminal B is a logic high and the signal at terminal A is also a logic high. As seen in Table II, the logic of the multiplexer 444 is so arranged that for the non zero condition, input X3 is coupled to terminal X so that the sign of the up down signal is always high. If an all zeros condition occurs at the angle generator, then the signal at terminal A will be a logic low, resulting in coupling of terminal X2 to terminal X, maintaining the logic high condition since both X2 and X3 are coupled to a dc source. In the offset mode, terminal B of the multiplexer 444 is at a logic low, so that the signal from terminal X1 is coupled to terminal X. This provides a logic low on line 354 resulting in decrementing the angle counter 30. If an all zeros condition is detected during the count, then terminal A is reset to a logic low. The output signal of the inverter 438, which is a logic high, is coupled to terminal X and then to line 354 so that the angle counter 30 is urged to increment. Where the signal inputs to the XOR gate 436 are different, then the output signal is high, resulting in a count increment. Thus, depending on the relative magnitude and direction of the offset and new angles, the counter will be urged to increment, decrement or both increment and decrement where the angle signs are the same to provide the magnitude of the difference angle. With continued reference to Figures 6 and 7, the offset angle memory 32 is comprised of the latches 402,404,406 for storing angular data therein in binary form. The inputs DO D5 of latches 402 and 404 and DO of latch 406 are coupled to receive binary signals from angle generator 30, lines 384 through 399. The clock inputs are coupled to receive the offset latch pulse on line 170. The memory thereby comprises a thirteen bit angle data store. The output of the latches 402,404,406 is coupled to the respective inputs of the angle generator 30, counters 308,310,312 and 314. Thus, the angle generator 30 in the normal mode counts all the pulses of the angle clock 24. However, signals from the memory 32 also address the angle generator 30 in the set ofset mode in the following manner. At the start of each cycle, the clear signal CLR 1 resets the counters of the angle generator 30 to zero. When the difference pulse 258 is active, the angle generator counts all the pulses of the angle clock 24. At the end of the difference pulse, the counts stored in the angle generator represent the angular displacement to be displayed. This count then passes through the multiplexer 302 where it is latched into the decoder 304 by the latched display pulse on line 168. The most significant bit MSB and sign of the angle are also latched at the same time in the flip flops 328 and 330, respectively. In the normal mode, the angular displacement measured is with respect to zero, i.e. with respect to the earth s gravity vector. These values also address and continually update the latches of memory 32. In the set offset mode, the offset latch pulse on line 170 is coupled to the clock inputs of the latches, thereby causing the values presently displayed on the LCD to be latched into the offset latches 402,404 and 406. When the apparatus is then placed in the offset mode, the value previously latched into the offset latches is coupled into the preset inputs PO P3 of the counters 308,310,312 and to input PO of the counter 413 of angle generator 30. This offset value is parallel loaded into the angle generator counters by the load offset pulse applied to the PL terminals of the counters via line 166. The offset values, therefore, bias the angle counter values in a direction determined by the up down signal 354 so as to load the difference value into the multiplexer 302 for display on the LCD. The power up reset circuit 50 of Figure 7 provides a short, active high pulse to initialise the electronics to the normal mode by providing a mementary high at the PL terminal of the counter 418. When power is applied to terminal V at C6, the full supply voltage is applied to one input of the OR gate 420. A logic high is coupled from the gate 420 to terminal PL of the counter 418. As capacitor C6 charges, the voltage across the resistor R6 decreases until at the threshold level the reset pulse is no longer communicated to the gate 420 and the counter 418. When the counter 418 is reset, the offset latch pulse enable and offset load enable outputs on lines 381 and 382 revert to a logic low, so that the LCD display 40 is energised in the normal mode. The power up reset signal on line 266 is also communicated to the D flip flop 220 Figure 3 for initialising the LCD decimal point displays. Referring now to Figure 8, a circuit for monitoring the battery supply voltage is shown at 38. Typically, a standard 9.0 volt portable radio battery would be used to power the electronics. Resistor network R9,R10,R11 applies a bias to a voltage detector 502 which comprises a programmable voltage detector which is biased, for example, to sense when the battery voltage drops below 6.5 volts d.c. The output thereupon changes state from a logic high to a logic low, thus coupling the backplane 2 signal on line 156 through an XOR gate 504 and an inverter 506 to actuate the LO BAT segment of the LCD. The circuit shown provides optional hysteresis to avoid erratic output conditions due to changes in battery voltage with circuit loading and transient noise. The addition of hysteresis by the connection to HYST 2 makes the trip points slightly different for rising and falling inputs thereby avoiding unstable operation. A suitable device is the ICL7665, available from G.E. Intersil, 10900 N. Tantau, Avenue, Cupertino, CA 95014, United States of America. The overrange circuit 26 is used to blank the digits of the LCD when the linear range of the sensor has been exceeded and to turn on the OVERRANGE annunciator on the LCD. The overrange circuit operates by sensing the relative pulse widths of the pulsed sensor interface output PW1 and reference pulse widths corresponding to the linear sensor range. Since the pulse width is a function of the sensor inclination, pulse width may be used as a measure of the departure from the allowable range of inclination. Timing modules 508 and 510 co operate with appropriate resistor capacitor combinations R7,C7 and R8, C8 to provide a monostable multivibrator circuit that will yield a desired time interval. In a typical application, R7 and C7 are selected to provide a pulse width of 1.9ms corresponding to a pulse width PW1 at an inclination in a negative direction of slightly greater than 45 When the sensor 20 is inclined at a negative angle greater than 45 The inverter 512 causes the clock pulse to go from logic low to logic high 1.9 ms after the trigger pulse. Since the sensor pulse is of shorter duration than the clock pulse and is applied to the data input, the data pulse will be zero when the flip flop is toggled and the state of the flip flop 516 will be changed on the rising edge of the clock pulse. Since Q was initially in a logic low state when it is toggled by the clock signal, it becomes a logic high signal. This logic high is coupled to an OR gate 520 and results in a logic high on overrange line 350. Considering now the module 510, since the reference maximum pulse width output of 6.1 ms is greater than the 1.9 ms output of the sensor 20, the data pulse applied to terminal D of a flip flop 518 falls to zero before the clock pulse is initiated. Consequently, the flip flop 518 is toggled so that the Q output to the OR gate 520 remains at a logic low. The effect then is that the module 508 is activated to energise the overrange line 350, representing an angular deflection of the sensor 20 which exceeds the allowable minimum or negative angle deflection. Conversely, for an angle greater than 45 When overrange line 350 goes to a logic high, this causes the multiplexer MX 302 of Figure 6 to output an all ones count to the decoder drivers 304. This condition blanks the digits of LCD. The overrange signal on line 350 is applied to one input of an XOR gate 522. The backplane 2 signal on line 156 is applied to a second input of the XOR gate 522. This effectively changes the phase of the output of the gate 522 by 180 The LCD drivers of the circuit 34 for the SET and ALT REF legends operate in a similar manner to that of the logic driving the XOR gate 522. In the normal mode, the backplane 2 reference signal is applied to one input of XOR gates 526 and 528 and then applied to the display terminals. Consequently, the annunciators to which these gates are coupled are blanked, since there must be a phase difference between the backplane signal and the indicator terminal in order for the indicator to be active. In the set offset mode the offset latch pulse enable signal on line 382 is coupled to the XOR 526 and the SET legend will be energised showing that the offset angle has been set. The offset latch pulse enable signal is simultaneously applied to one input of the OR gate 524. Since the offset load enable signal on line 381 is a logic low during set offset, the OR gate 521 transfers the logic high to the XOR gate 528. Since the backplane 2 voltage is also applied to the XOR gate 528, the result is again a phase inversion of the output, and the illumination of the ALT REF legend. In the offset mode of operation, the offset latch pulse is returned to a logic low which extinguishes the SET indicator. However, since the offset load enable line 381 is now placed in a logic high condition, the logic high signal applied to the XOR gate 528 results in an inversion of the backplane 2 signal, and therefore the ALT REF legend continues to remain illuminated. When the offset load enable signal is returned to a logic low for the normal mode, the ALT REF legend will be extinguished. Figure 9 shows the circuitry 28 for generating the various timing signals used in the invention, and Figure 10 shows the signal waveforms resulting therefrom. These figures show the generation of backplane reference voltage, the system clear pulse, the sensor trigger pulse, the offset latch pulse, the offset load pulse, and the latch display data pulse. Also shown in Figure 10 are the output waveforms generated by the various divider circuits for combining to generate the desired control signals. An astable R C oscillator 100 is coupled to a timing network R1,C1 for generating a square wave with a frequency of 768 Hz. A module 102 is a conventional binary counter which provides the following frequencies by dividing down from the clock input of 768 Hz 384 Hz, 96 Hz, and 48 Hz. The output of the counter 102 is cascaded as an input to a counter 104 which provides further output frequencies 24,12,6 and 3 Hz. These frequencies are used to provide the necessary timing signals shown in Figure 10. The 96 Hz output from the counter 102 is applied to inverters 106 and 108 to establish backplane reference signals 1 and 2 for the LCD 40. They are also used in conjunction with the display driver circuitry of Figure 8 to energise annunciator segments other than the digits of the LCD. The system clear signals CLR1 and CLR2 are a logic high signal of approximately 20.8 ms in duration derived from an OR gate 110 by combining the 24 Hz, 12Hz, 6 Hz and 3 Hz pulses. Since the phase is inverted in logic elements 112 and 114, the signal is high for the first portion of every cycle. The signal When a user wishes to hold an LCD reading, the switch S1 may be depressed. So long as the switch S1 is depressed, a logic high is applied by the inverter 128 to one input of the OR gate 126, which activates reset and inhibits any further latch display data pulses. In operation, referring again to Figure 1, the circuit is first set to operate in the normal mode. Assume for purposes of explanation that the degrees display has been selected and that the sensor 20 is inclined at an angle of 45 If the scale factor select switch S2 is now actuated, for providing an output display in mils, the angle clock frequency is transferred to a 200 KHz rate. At 45.0 If it is desired to provide a display calibrated in in ft, then the system is wired to utilise the optional scale factor clock of Figure 4. At 45.0 As the inclination angle of the sensor 20 is changed, the corresponding pulse width outputs will increase or decrease depending on the direction and angle of inclination. The difference pulse generated in the scale factor clock 24 will gate the selected angle clock frequency accordingly to provide a number of pulses to the angle generator 30 which represents the sensed angle in the desired scale factor units. The output of the angle generator 30 is then supplied to the display driver 34 in the manner previously described. If it is desired to hold a particular reading for reference, the switch S1 may be used to latch the displayed data into the display driver 34 via the flip flop 130. On again depressing the hold reading switch S1, the display will be returned to the normal active mode. A sensed angle may be stored in the memory 32 by depressing the switch S3, which will actuate the select offset mode. The offset latch pulse thereby generated will latch the displayed angle into the memory 32. Upon again depressing the switch S3 to enter the offset mode, the stored values will be used to preset the angle generator 30 by means of the offset load enable pulse, so that only a difference value will be displayed. Upon again depressing the mode select switch S3, the apparatus will return to the normal mode. The overrange detector 26 receives signals from the sensor interface 22 which are compared with internal pulse width references representative of the maximum and minimum allowable pulse widths for linear operation. When the comparison indicates that the allowable linear range has been exceeded, the flip flop 516 or 518 will actuate the overrange output to the decoder 304, resulting in blanking the LCD display and actuating the overrange annunciator. In the event that the battery supply voltage is degraded beyond an allowable value set by the biases applied to the voltage detector 502, the LO BAT annunciator will be illuminated. However, the system will not be inhibited from operation.
