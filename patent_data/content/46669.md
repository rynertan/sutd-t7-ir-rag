The invention also provides for a method for making a fusion protein comprising the amino acid sequence of a somatostatin or a somatostatin precursor as its C terminal end and a portion of a procaryotic protein as its N terminal end characterized by incubating a microorganism transformed by an expression vector. The invention further provides for a process for synthesizing a somatostatin or a somatostatin precursor selected from the group comprising preprosomatostatin l, preprosomatostatin 2 and somatostatin 2 characterized by incubating a microorganism transformed by an expression vector comprising a deoxynucleotide sequence coding for said somatostatin or somatostatin precursor under conditions suitable for expression of said deoxynucleotide sequence and purifying said somatostatin or somatostatin precursor from the lysate or culture medium of said microorganism. Somatostatin was originally isolated from the mammalian hypothalamus and shown to be an inhibitor of the secretion of growth hormone, Vale, W., et al.,C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 275, 2913 1972 . The hormone is a peptide of 14 amino acids length. The amino acid sequence of human Somatostatin is AlaGlyCysLysAsnPhe PheTrpLysThrPheThrSerCys. The peptide may be linear or cyclic, by disulfide bond formation between the two Cys residues, but either form is active. More recent work has shown that the hormone is more widespread throughout the body and has a broader range of regulatory activities than was previously supposed. In particular, Somatostatin has been localized in the D cells of the endocrine pancreas and has been shown to be an inhibitor of both insulin and glucagon secretion.In addition, Somatostatin has been detected in discrete epithelial cells lining the gut where it functions to inhibit the secretion of several gastrointestinal hormones including secretin, gastrin and choleocystikinin. However, Somatostatin is not universally involved in regulating the secretion of peptide hormones, since it has no effect on the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone or thyrotropin. In addition to its regulatory role in the production of certain hormones, there is also evidence suggesting that Somatostatin functions as a neurotransmitter. The widespread localization and breadth of this hormone s regulatory activity indicate that the somatostatin activity is of fundamental physiological significance. However, there is no evidence that the observed regulatory effects are everywhere exerted by the same compound. Indeed, peptides up to 10 times the size of Somatostatin have been found which react withSomatostatin antibodies. See Conlon, J. et al.,FEBS Letts., 94, 327 1978 and Noe, B. et al., Endocrinology, 102, 1675 1978 . One such larger peptide has been shown able to inhibit secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary. Recently, a 28 residue peptide containing the somatostatin sequence has been isolated from porcine intestinal tissue and sequenced Pradagrol, L., FEBS Letts, 109, 55 1980 .These and other observations have prompted the suggestion thatSomatostatin, in common with a number of other peptide hormones, may be synthesized as part of a large precursor peptide that is subsequently processed. Such processing could modify the known somatostatin activities, resulting in enhanced specificity or selectivity. Analogs of Somatostatin have been chemically synthesized. Such analogs have altered relative activities in their effects on different hormones when compared with Somatostatin itself. Thus, the somatostatin analogs and peptides comprising the somatostatin sequence are known to have somatostatin activity although the relative selectivity and specificity of these activities may be different from Somatostatin itself. The magnitude of such differences may not be predictable from knowledge of the structure alone. As a general principle, it would be expected that larger proteins comprising the somatostatin sequence display more specificity of activity.In fact, the emerging picture is that Somatostatin itself is but one of a family of related peptides, all of whom function to inhibit the secretion of peptides, especially peptide hormones, but which may differ in amino acid sequence, depending upon their source and target tissue. We refer herein to this general class of peptides as somatostatins. Because of their known biological activities, the somatostatins have utility for the regulation of hormone output and for the treatment of disease conditions characterized by hormone overproduction.Somatostatin is subject to rapid degradation by proteases. In addition, Somatostatin itself is rapidly excreted following parenteral administration, making it difficult to control the effective dose. Larger peptides are excreted more slowly. Therefore, higher molecular weight somatostatins provide the means for more readily obtaining and controlling a satisfactory effective dose.The somatostatins will be advantageous for the treatment of a broad range of hormone imbalance conditions. For example, a somatostatin selectively inhibiting glucagon but not insulin secretion would be beneficial for insulin dependent diabetics who suffer ill effects from relative overproduction of glucagon, which exacerbates hyperglycemia. Also, proliferative retinopathy, which is a frequent pathology in diabetes, is linked to the overproduction of growth hormone in such patients and therefore adult patients can benefit from administration of a somatostatin. Constant maximal secretion induced by hyperglycemia may be deleterious to B cells. Some individuals produce a small but insufficient quantity of endogeneous insulin at maximum capacity. These patients can benefit from administration of an exogenous somatostatin.Patients whose glucagon synthesis is relatively normal would benefit similarly from administration of a soatostatin lacking the activity of inhibiting glucagon secretion. Somatostatin has been purified from various tissue sources and has also been synthesized by ordinary peptide chemistry techniques. In addition, Somatostatin has been synthesized by a microorganism using recombinant DNA techniques, Itakura, K. et al., Science, 198, 1056 1977 . In that instance, the DNA coding for the amino acid sequence of Somatostatin was chemically synthesized on the basis of the known amino acid sequence, and the coding relationships of the genetic code. The codons were selected on the basis of supposed compatibility with the host microorganism, E. coli.Until the present invention, we believe that the naturally occurring DNA sequence coding for somatostatin has never been isolated and characterized. Consequently, no information regarding precursor proteins was available. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention discloses the cloning of cDNA containing naturally occurring sequences coding for somatostatins comprising both known and novel somatostatin sequences. For the purpose of this application, the following nomenclature is employed Somatostatin 1 S1 refers to the 14 amino acid peptide heretofore termed Somatostatin, supra1 and in the prior art. Somatostatin 2 52 is a novel, naturally occurring somatostatin. Preprosomatostatin 1 Propro S1 is a novel protein comprising S1 as its C terminal sequence, and having as its N terminal sequence a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids characteristic of the signal peptide described for other precursors of secretory proteins, Devillers Thiery, A. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci. USA, 72, 5016 1975 . Prosomatostatin 1 Pro S1 results from the removal of the signal peptide from Prepro S1. Similarly, preprosomatostatin 2 Prepro S2 and prosÏmatostatin 2 Pro S2 are novel proteins comprising the S2 amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus and a signal peptide in the case of prepro S2 or lacking the signal peptide in the case of pro S2.Prepro S1 has a molecular weight approximately the size of the big somatostatin molecule which has been detected in both mammalian and fish tissue, Conlon, J.et al., supra, and Noe, B. et al., supra. Prepro S1 and prepro S2 are considered to be naturally occurring precursor molecules from which active somatostatins, including pro S1, S1, pro S2 andS2 are derived by additional processing steps. The present invention provides for the synthesis of the foregoing novel somatostatins in a microorganism transformed by cDNA coding appropriately for the desired protein, said cDNA being inserted in a transfer vector suitable for obtaining expression of the cloned insert, either as a protein product or as a fusion protein coupled to a segment of bacterial protein. The. present invention therefore includes the novel somatostatins per se, new methods of making both the novel somatostatins and S1, transfer vectors comprising inserted coding sequences for the foregoing somatostatins, new microorganisms transformed by the above mentioned transfer vectors, and new fusion proteins comprising the amino acid sequences of the foregoing somatostatins. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Since a naturally occuring coding sequence comprising the coding region for S1 had never previously been isolated, it was necessary to use as starting material a tissue known to have a sufficiently high proportion of somtostatin producing cells to permit the practical isolation of mRNA sufficiently enriched in somatostatin coding sequences. In the anglerfish Lophius americanus , the endocrine pancreas, termedBrockmann body, is easily separable from exocrine tissue and is highly enriched in D cell types somatostatin producing relative to B cells insulinproducing . Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of S1 isolated from anglerfish Brockmann body cells is identical to mammalian S1, Noe, B. et al., Endocrinology, ios, 1410 1979 . A variety of cDNA inserts were synthesized from Brockmann body mRNA and cloned. The clones were then tested for their ability to cross hybridize with each other. In this manner, it was determined that the majority of cDNA clones fell into one of three groups. Subsequent analysis showed that these groups included cDNA coding for fish preproinsulin, prepro S1 and, unexpectedly, the sequence coding for prepro S2. The techniques of the present invention have made extensive use of enzyme catalyzed reactions. RNA is isolated from Brockmann body cells using conventional techniques. Polyadenylated RNA is isolated by affinity chromatography. The polyadenylatedRNA is used as the template for preparing a double stranded cDNA copy using conventional techniques. The first cDNA strand is synthesized using reverse transcriptase, an olig dT primer and the polyadenylatedRNA. After synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, theRNA is removed by alkali digestion and the singlestranded cDNA is used to self prime the synthesis of the second strand by reverse transcriptase. The singlestranded hairpin loop is removed by digestion with S1 nuclease. The cDNA is now ready for insertion into an appropriate transfer vector. Suitable transfer vectors include those which are capable of transforming bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the inl, csp and esp mutant strains of Neurospora crassa and animal cells in tissue culture.Examples of transfer vectors suitable for use in this invention which are capable of transforming E. coli include the plasmids pSC101, pMB9, pBR313, pBR315, pBR316 and pBR322 and the vectors derived from bacteriophage, i.e., Charon 3A, Charon 4A,Charon 16A and xstWES B.

One such vector has been identified as plasmid pC194. Hybrid plasmids containing yeast DNA either plasmid and or chromosomal DNA and bacterial DNA generally E.coli plasmid DNA are used to transform yeast. Such plasmids have been described by Beggs, J.D., Nature 275, 104 1978 Asiav, C.L. and Carbon, J., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 76, 3829 1979 and Kingsman, A.K., et al.,Gene 7, 141 1979 . Transfer vectors which can be utilized to transform animal cells in tissue culture include Adeno defective virus, SV 40 defective virus and polyoma virus. The cDNA is inserted into a transfer vector using conventional techniques. The cDNA is usually inserted into any restriction site which is unique in the transfer vector. Charon 3A and 4A and agt WES j B do not contain unique sites and, as a result, restriction sites of limited number are used for these vectors. The unique restriction sites in various transfer vectors and the useful restriction sites in vectors Charon 3A and 4A and gt WES. B are shown in Table 2.

Insertion at this site results in loss of tetracycline resistance. The cDNA can be inserted into the transfer vector by the use of restriction site linkers or deoxynucleotide tailing. In the former, a synthetic nucleotide containing a recognition site for a particular restriction endonuclease, such as those discussed above, can be blunt end ligated to the cDNA.The cDNA and transfer vector are separately incubated with the restriction endonuclease and then annealed to form the transfer vector containing the cDNA. In the latter, the cDNA can be tailed using a deoxynucleotide and terminal transferase as described by Roychoudhury,R., et al., Nucl.Acids Res., 3, 863 1976 . The transfer vector, after digestion with a restriction endonuclease, can be tailed using the complementary deoxynucleotide in the same procedure. The tailed transfer vector and tailed cDNA are then annealed to form the transfer vector containing the cDNA. For example, the cDNA can be dC tailed and the transfer vector can be opened at the st I site and dG tailed. The transfer vector containing the cDNA is then used to transform a suitable host. Hosts which are suitable for the various transfer vectors include E. coli,B. subtilis, yeast, N. crassa, and animal cells in tissue culture The transfer vectors which are capable of transforming each of these hosts have been described above. Three mutant strains of E. coli are conventionally utilized. These are 1776, RRI and HB101. E. coli 9C1776 has been described in Curtis, R.,Ann.Rev.Microbiol. 30, 507 1976 and U.S. Patent No.4,190,495. E. coli RRI has been described inDugaiczyk, A., et al., Molecular Mechanisms in Control ofGene Expression at p. 543. E. coli HB101 has been described in Kedes, D.H. and Thomas, C.A., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 73, 1537 1976 . The suitable hosts are transformed by conventional techniques. For example,E. coli 87C1776 is transformed by the transfer vector containing the cDNA as described by Cooke, N.E., et al.,J.Biol.Chem., 255, 6502 1980 . Colonies are selected and or screened by conventional techniques. For example, colonies may be selected based on the loss of a phenotypic trait, such as tetracycline resistanceColonies may be screened by 1 removing the cDNA by an appropriate restriction endonuclease and analyzing it by electrophoresis and hybridization Southerri, E.M.,J.Mol.Biol. 98, 503 1975 , or 2 replicating as described by Grunstein, M. and Hogness, D.S., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 72, 3961 1975 and hybridizing with an appropriate problem, or 3 examining colonies directly for expression by RIA or other techniques. The cloned DNAs designated pLaSl and pLaS2 are expressed in bacteria to yield either fusion proteins comprising the peptides coded by the inserted sequences, or the peptides themselves. Several possible techniques are available as options, and may include a modification of the coding sequences to provide an exact desired translational starting point b selection or construction of an optimal expression vector and c post translational processing, either by exploiting in vivo processing activity of the host or by in vitro chemical means. Where a fusion protein is expressed, modification of the cloned nucleotide sequence will generally be unnecessary as long as the resulting sequence permits translation of the insert in the correct reading frame and no stop codons intervene before the initial codon of the inserted sequence. Both S1 and S2 may be expressed conveniently as fusion proteins followed by post translational in vitro processing, since both are joined to the rest of the Pro S1 or Pro S2 sequences by the dipeptide arg lys. Such a sequence is especially susceptible to tryptic hydrolysis. Both S1 and S2 are readily released by partial tryptic digestion of their respective precursors. Prepro S1 and Prepro S2 are expressed as fusion proteins by insertion into appropriate sites within expressed operons including, for example, thePst I site in the A iactamase gene of pBR322 VillaKomaroff, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 75, 3727 1978 , the EcoRI site of pBR322 carrying the lay control region and coding sequence for A galactosidase Itakura, K., et al., Science, 198, 1056 1979 , or the Hind III site of the trpD gene of plasmid ptrpED50 Martial, J., et al., Science, 205, 602 1979 .Modifications of sequence lengthy one or two nucleotides in order to achieve correct reading frame phase are well known in the art. Insertions at thePst I site of pBR322, with the aid of the tailing procedure, occur in correct phase and reading frame with a probability of 1 6. Pro S1 and Pro S2 are prepared from fusion proteins susceptible of specific cleavage in vitro, The cloned nucleotide sequences are modified to code for amino acid sequences providing specificity for a proteolytic enzyme. A useful sequence is AspAsnAspAspLys, cleaved preferentially by the enzyme enterokinase, as described in copending application Ser. No. 125,878, filed February 29, 1980, incorporated herein by reference. As described therein, a linking nucleotide sequence coding for the foregoing amino acid sequence is inserted adjacent the nucleotide sequence coding for the desired amino terminus of Pro S1 or Pro 52. Such insertion requires modification of pLaSI or pLaS2, by removal of nucleotides on the 3 end of thePro S1 or Pro S2 coding sequence. This will be accomplished either by controlled digestion of the 3 end of the insert using 3 endonuclease or T4 DNA polymerase, or by the combination of restriction endonuclease cleavage at a point to the 5 side of the desired starting point and chemical synthesis to restore that portion of the desired sequence thus removed. Controlled digestion is preferably carried out usingT4 polymerase, which, in the absence of added deoxynucleotide triphosphates, catalyzes 3 to 5 exonucleolytic digestion of double stranded DNA Englund, P.T., J. Biol. Chem., 246, 3269 1971 . The extent of digestion is controlled by selection of proper temperature, reaction time and amount of enzyme, according to principles well known in the art.Experimentation will be necessary in each instance, since optimal reaction conditions must be determined for each lot of enzyme and for each DNA to be modified. By these means, the extent of digestion can be controlled.Termination of digestion at a predetermined stopping point is achieved by including a single deoxynucleotide triphosphate in the reaction mixture, corresponding to the desired stopping point. For example, in the presence of dATP, the DNA is digested 3 5 until the polymerase reaches a dA residue, at which point further net digestion ceases. Several cycles of digestion, each with its predetermined stopping point, can be carried out in sequence, to construct DNA molecules having a predetermined end point. Exonucleolytic digestion withT4 polymerase affects only the strands having 3 termini.The complementary strands remain as unpaired singlestranded tails, which must also be removed. S1 nuclease is the preferred enzyme for the purpose. The product of combined treatment with T4 polymerase and SI nuclease is blunt ended, double stranded DNA. Chemical synthesis of deoxynucleotide sequences used to replace segnts cleaved by restriction endonuclease digestion is carried out, for example, as described by Itakura, K., et al.,J. Biol. Chem., 250, 4592 1975 and Itakura, K., et al., J. Am Chem. Soc., 97, 7327 1975 . Prepro S1 and Prepro S2 are synthesized in similar fashion, expressed initially as fusion proteins. By the use of appropriate expression transfer vectors, the somatostatis of the present invention are also expressed directly, i.e., not fused to any procaryotic protein. In general, it is necessary to modify the cloned inserts, pLaSl and pLaS2, to remove the 5 untranslated region preceding the desired starting point. Where Pcrzo S1 and Prepro S2 are the primary e pression products, the other somatostatins are obtai ed from them. The underlying pr ineiple of direct expression is tI t the inserted DNA segment entirely replaces the codin segment normally transcribed and translated by the 1 s terial control region. The essential co aponent of ti control region to be preserved is termed the export ion unit. The expression unit includes a promo ctr and a ribosomal binding site capable of acting in the host organism. As a practical matter, it is not necessary to remove precisely the nucleotides coding for the host portion of the fusion protein.The relationship between the ribosomal binding site and the start codon AUG is such that the start codon may be located anywhere within 3 to 11 nucleotides of the ribosomal binding site, Shine et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 71, 1342 1974 Steitz, J., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci USA, 72, 4734 1975 . In this 3 11 nucleotide region, the first AUG to be encountered sets the reading frame for translation. In the case of ptrpE30, derived from ptrpED50 described supra and containing the operator, promoter, attenuator and ribosome binding sequences of the tryptophan operon together with the nucleotide sequence coding for seven amino acids of the trpE protein followed by a Hind III site, the removal of a minimum of 23 29 nucleotides from the Hind III site provides a site for insertion into an expression unit under tryptophan operon control. For the direct expression of Prepro S1, for example, the original cDNA insert is modified as described above to remove the 5 untranslated region.A vector for direct expression can be constructed by modification of ptrpE30 by removing 23 29 nucleotides using T4 DNA polymerase and S1 nuclease as described above. A linker nucleotide sequence containing the restriction sequence for 3am HI endonuclease is bluntend ligated to both the modified cDNA insert and the modified ptrpE30 by the procedure of Valenzuela, et al., supra. This is done to facilitate insertion which is performed essentially as described by Ullrich, A., et al., Science, 196, 1313 1977 . Suitable hosts, such as E. coli HB101, RRI, or t41776 or other bacteria are transformed by the recombinant vectors bearing the inserted Prepro S1 coding region.Transformants are selected for resistance to ampicillin and then grown under conditions suitable for expression of PreproS1. Prepro S1 and Prepro S2 are converted to Pro S1 and Pro S2, respectively, by removal of the N terminal sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that comprise the signal peptide. In vitro removal of the signal peptide is carried out by treating the protein extracted from transformed, induced cells, with a preparation of rough microsomes, as described by Jackson, R.C., Blobel, G. 1977 , Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 5598. In vivo removal of the signal peptide may occur during direct bacterial expression of the Prepro S1 or Prepro S2 coding sequence. Bacterial and mammalian signal peptides share sequence similarities. Proteins having mammalian signal peptides may be processed by bacterial cells, resulting in excretion of the propeptide in this instance Pro S1 into the periplasmic space or into the medium. This occurrence of such bacterial processing is detectable by observing the occurrence of a protein in the medium or periplasmic space of induced cells, not found in uninduced cells, as measured by incorporation of a radioactive amino acid or by radioimmunoassay. S1 and S2 themselves may be prepared by tryptic digestion of either Prepro S1 or Pro S1 andPrepro S2 or Pro S2, respectively, as described supra.Either whole cell extracts or partially purified protein preparations may be treated in this fashion to yield S1 or S2. Prepro S1, Pro S1, S1, Prepro S2, Pro S2 andS2, synthesized as described, are purified by techniques well known in the art, including, for example, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and differential solubility techniques.The amino acid sequences are confirmed by conventional methods of amino acid sequence analysis. Purified enzymes for use in the practice of the present invention are presently available from commercial sources. Restriction endonucleases, their nomenclature and site specificity have been described in detail by Roberts, R., Crit. Rev. Biochem., 4, 123 1976 .The restriction enzymes used in this work were obtained from New England BioLabs, Beverly, Massachusetts, and used in amounts and under reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer for each enzyme. Reverse transcriptase was provided by Dr. J. Beard, LifeSciences, Inc., St. Petersburg, Florida. DNA polymeraseI and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from NewEngland BioLabs, Beverly, Massachusetts. Micrococcal S1 nuclease was obtained from Miles Laboratories,Elkhart, Indiana. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corporation,Freehold, New Jersey. Example 1 Synthesis of cDNA. RNA was extracted from anglerfish Brockmann bodies obtained from BiologicalAssociates, Portland, Maine, by the guanidine thiocyanate method, Chirgwin et al,, Biochemistry, 24, 5194 1979 . One gram of Brockmann body tissue yields approximately 6.5 mg of total RNA. Polyadenylated RNA was purified using oligo dT cellulose affinity chromatography, Aviv, H. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.USA, 69, 1409 1972 . 1.3 Ag of single stranded cDNA was made from 10 bXg polyadenylated RNA using reverse transcriptase Lot No. 1577 in the following reaction mix of 200 AwL volume 40mM tris HCl, pH 8.3, 10mM MgC12, 56 mM A mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 0.15 mM 3H dCTP sp. Act. 5.2 mCi sscg ml polyadenylatedRNA, 15 units reverse transcriptase stg RNA. Incubation was at 400C for 30 minutes and then at 680C for two minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of NaEDTA pH 8.0 to 20mM and the reaction mixture was then chromatographed over G 75 Sephadex trademarkPharmacia, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden .The DNA containing fraction was ethanol precipitated. RNA was removed by alkali treatment 0.2M NaOH, 23 min. at 680C and the second strand cDNA was carried out in the following reaction mix using DNA polymerase I 100 mM Na HEPES pH 6.9, 75mM KCl, l0mM MgC12, 10mM dithiothreitol DTT , 100mM each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0,8 g ml single stranded cDNA boiled three minutes just prior to addition , and 75 units E. coli DNA polymerase I g DNA. Incubation was at 140C for two hours. The reaction volume was made 20mM NaEDTA, extracted once with phenolchioroformisoamyl alcoholC50 48 2 by volume and passed over a G 75 Sephadex column.In preparation for dC tailing, the hairpin loops of the double stranded DNA ds cDNA were clipped and made blunt ended using S1 micrococcal nuclease. S1 digestion was carried out at 370C for 30 minutes in 100 Wl reaction volume, containing 0.3M NaCl, 0.03M NaOAc, 3 ZnC12, pH 4.5, 175 S1 units Ag ds cDNA. After organic extraction and G 75 Sephadex chromatography to remove small DNA fragments, 300 ng of trimmed ds cDNA was tailed using calf thymus terminal transferase in a 30 minute reaction at 370C containing 140ntI potassium cacodylate, 30mM tris base pH 7.8 , lmM CoC12, 0.lmMDTT, 25 M dCTP alpha 32P dCTP, 8.36 sXCi nmole , and 150 units terminal transferase g ds cDNA. The tailing reaction is described, generally, by Roychoudhury, R., et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 3, 101 1976 . Preliminary experiments indicated approximately 30 bases are added to the 3 end under these conditions.Plasmid pBR322 was cleaved by Pst I endonuclease and provided with dG tails by the previously described tailing reaction, except that dGTP was used instead of dCTP, and no radioactive label was employed. Equimolar amounts of dC tailed cDNA and dG tailed pBR322 were annealed at a concentration of 1 Jtg ml, using sequential two hour incubations at 420C, 300C and 140C 36 . The hybrid plasmid DNA was ethanol precipitated and then used to transform E. coli1776 and selected for tetracycline resistance To screen with various labeled probes, recombinant colonies were grown on Whatman 541 cellulose paper, lysed in situ and prepared for hybridization according to the procedure of Grunstein et al. andProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 3961 1975 .The filters were hybridized to a 32P labeled cDNA probe synthesized from anglerfish Brockmann body polyA RNA, and plasmidDNA was isolated from those colonies giving a strong autoradiographic signal using a procedure described byStaudenbauer, W.L., Nol. Gen. Genet., 145, 273 1976 .Several plasmids were selected on the basis of their size as measured by gel electrophoresis and their cDNA inserts were purified on preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified insert cDNA from these plasmids was labeled by nick translation and hybridized with other purified cDNAs in pair wise combinations. By this means the inserts could be divided into a number of non cross hybridizing groups and their relative frequency estimated. The most frequently occurring insert among the colonies selected as described was shown by nucleotide sequence analysis to code for fish preproinsulin. Two additional groups were analyzed and specific inserts, designated pLaSl and pLaS2, were selected for analysis. The two selected inserts were analyzed to estimate the size of the corresponding mRNA specific to each, by the method of Alwine et al., Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci. USA, 74, 5350 1977 . The method entailed hybridization to anglerfish polyadenylated RNA which had been previously chromatographed on a 28 agarose methyl mercury gel Bailey, J., et al., Anal. Biochem., 70, 75 1976 , and transferred to diazotized cellulose paper Alwine, Jr., et al., supra . Hybridization was for 48 hours at 420C. Hybridized fibers were autoradiographed after washing three times 100 ml volume, 10 minutes each in 0.3M Nail, 0.03M NaCitrate, 0.18 w v SDS at 200C and then in the same manner using 5mM NaCl, 1.5mM NaCitrate 0.18 SDS at 500C. The results are shown in Figure 1.Lane 1 Hind III digested DNA and Hae III digested X174 DNA molecular weight standards Lane 2 Ethidium bromide staining of anglerfish Brockmann body 1 J4g polyadenylated RNA Lane 3 Hybridization of transferred anglerfish polyA to pLaSl 32P insert DNA Lane 4 Hybridization of transferred anglerfish polyA RNA to pLaS2 32P insertDNA. From the data of Figure 1, it can be seen that both pLaS1 and pLaS2 hybridize specifically to mRNAs of approximately 700 bases, corresponding to the size of one major class of polyadenylated mRNA found in theBrockmann body. By a similar analysis, the other major polyadenylated mRNA of 840 bases was shown to correspond to inserts coding for preproinsulin. Example 2 The deoxynucleotide sequences of pLaSl and pLaS2 were analyzed by the method of Maxam, A, et al.,Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 560 1977 . The ribonucleotide sequences are shown in Figure 3, together with the corresponding predicted amino acid sequences cc ded by the sense strands of the DNA, i.e., the strands corresponding in sequence to the respective mRNAs. The deoxynucleotide sequence of the sense strand is identical except that T replaces U. The correct reading frame is recognized by a lack of termination codons over a substantial portion of the insert and, in the case of pLaSl, by the fact that it correctly codes for S1.The amino acid positions are numbered beginning with the amino terminal amino acid of S1 and proeding, in the positive direction, to the carboxy terminal end ofS1, and in the negative direction to the first AUG codon position 107 , presumed to be the point of translation initiation. Beginning with the first AUG codon at the 5 end of the sense strand, translation of pLaSl predicts the sequence of a 121 amino acid peptide which contains the S1 amino acid sequence at its carboxy terminus. The 121 amino acid peptide is a heretofore undescribed somatostatin, termed prepro S1 herein1 having a molecular weight of 13,328. Our results suggest that, in common with many other hormones, the synthesis of S1 involved posttranslational processing. The translation of somatostatin mRNA yields a precursor prepro S1 containing a signal peptide which may be released during the transit into the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resultant precursor pro S1 is subsequently cleaved to yield S1 itself. By analogy with other signal peptides, and in particular with that of anglerfish insulin with which it shares sequence homology, the prepeptide portion of prepro S1 is probably about 20 25 bases long.After removal of the signal peptide, the resultant proS1 molecule would have approximately 96 101 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of approximately 9,000.Pro S1 is more than five times the size of somatostatin. The pLaS2 deoxynucleotide sequence was analyzed in a manner similar to that described for pLaSl. Translation of pLaS2 predicts the sequence of a 125 amino acid peptide which surprisingly contains a 14 amino acid sequence at its carboxy terminus which differs fro S1 by only two amino acids, and is termed Somatostatin 2 S2 herein. Three novel somatostatins are therefore contained within the full sequence S2, Pro S2, and Prepro S2. The predicted molecular weights of Prepro S2 and Pro S2 are 14,100 and 11,600, respectively. Figure 3 shows the corresponding ribonucleotide and amino acid sequences of pLaS2. The deoxynucleotide sequence is identical except that T replaces U. Example 3 A Example 1 is repeated using plasmid pBR315 in place of plasmid pBR322. All conditions including selection of recombinant clones are as described. The inserts are removed and analyzed as described in Example 2, yielding DNA s of about 700 base pairs having the sequences shown in Figure 3.

Transformation of E. coli 1776 is performed as described in Example 1. A Hind III linkers having the sequence 5 CCAAGCTTGG 3 are ligated to the cDNA prepared inExample 1 by blunt end ligation using T4 DNA ligase as described by Valenzuela, P., et al., Nature 280, 815 1979 . After ligation, the product is digested with Hind III or Hsu I following the procedure described byUllrich, A. et al., Science 196, 1313 1977 . Plasmid pBR322 is cleaved at the Hind III restriction site with either Hind III or Hsu I and treated with alkaline phosphatase as described by Ullrich, A., et al., supra.

In this Example, the linkers for Sal I and Bam HI are used in place of the linkers for Hind III. The sequences of these linkers are 5 GGTCGACC 3 and 5 CCGGATCCGG 3 . When Sal I linkers are used, the linker treated cDNA and pBR322 are cleaved with restriction endonuclease Sal I and when Bam HI linkers are utilized, the restriction endonuclease is Bam HI. All conditions including selection of recombinant clones are as described in 4 A . For both linkers and restriction endonucleases, identical results are obtained. D Example 4 C is repeated in which plasmids pSC101, pMB9, pBR313, pBR315 and pBR316 are used in place of pBR322.

Recombinant phages can also be screened by utilizing the in situ plaque hybridization technique of Benton, W.D. and Davis,R.W., Science 196, 180 1977 . B Charon 3A DNA or Charon 4A DNA, prepared as described by Blattner, et al., supra, is used as the transfer vector in place of the Charon 16A DNA used above. All conditions are identical to those described for Charon 16A DNA. Selection of recombinant phages is performed by a plating the phages on Lac bacteria on plates containing X6 and isolating colorless plaques followed by either hybridization to a suitable probe or restriction endonuclease digestion as described byBlattner, et al., supra. The inserts are removed as described above, yielding DNA s of about 700 base pairs in length and having the sequences shown in Figures 1 and 2. C X gt WES LB DNA, prepared as described by Tiemier et al., supra, is utilized as the transfer vector in place of the Charon 16A used above.

The plasmid pC194 isolated from S. aureus as described by Ehrlich, S.D., supra, is utilized as the transfer vector. pC194 is cleaved at the Hind III site with Hind III or Hsu I and then treated with alkaline phosphatase as described by Ullrich, A. et al., supra.The cDNA having Hind III cohesive te rmini is ligated to the cleaved pC194 as described by Ullrich, A., et al., supra. Competence induction of B. subtilis RUB331 is performed as described by Sgaramella, V., et al., J.lTol.Biol., 105, 587 1976 and Borenstein, S. andEphrati Elizue, E., J.Mol.Biol., 45, 137 1969 .Transformation of B. subtilis RUB 331 is performed using the ligation mixture as described by Sgaramella et al.and Borenstein et al. The cell suspension is plated directly on L plates containing 3 ,qg of chloramphenicol.Selected recombinants are isolated as described inExample 1 and digested with Hind III and the digest analyzed as describe in Faple 2. DN s of about 700 base pairs in length and having the sequences shown inFigure 3 are recovered. E Ple 7 Synthesis of DNA coding for Prepro S1 A The insert DNA is first separated from pBR322 izT,aSl by Pst I endonuclease digestion, and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. A 15 g sample of purified insert DNA is then modified by sus endiny the DNA in water to which is added a concentrated solution of salts such that the final composition contains 70mM tris pH 8.8, 70 M MgC12 10mM dithiothreitol and 13.75 units of T4 poly erase P LBiochemicals, Milwaukee, Wisconsin in a Sal volume of 250 2t1. The reaction mixture is incubated 3.3 minutes at 37 C. To the reaction mixture is then added dTTP, 50 mM, to terminate endonucleolytic digestion at the next adenine residue in the sequence. After an additional 0.5 minutes incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to an ice bath and the enzyme is inactivated by heat treatment for five minutes at 650C. The treatedDNA is recovered by ethanol precipitation. Digestion with S1 nuclease to provide blunt ends is carried out as described by Ullrich, A., et awl., Science, 196, 1313 1977 . The translated region of pLaSl begins with an A residue, as shown in Figure 3. The nearest A residue in the 5 untranslated region is five residues prior to the start codon AUG . The above described digestion conditions are designed to remove approximately 30 nucleotides from the 3 end. Therefore, a significant proportion of the T4 polymerase digested DNA molecules will be terminated at the start codon at the position numbered 107. B Example 7 A is repeated in which the insert for Prepro S1 is removed by digestion of the transfer vectors prepared in Examples 3, 4, 5 and 6 by the appropriate restriction enzyme prior to digestion with T4 polymerase. The transfer vectors and restriction enzymes utilized are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Restriction Enzyme Transfer Vector Example Pst I 3A, 3B, 4G, 4H Hind III 4A, 4B, 6 Sal I 4C, 4D Bam HI 4C, 4D Eco RI 4E, 4F, 5A, 5B, 5C The remaining steps are as described in Example 7 A and identical results are obtained in each instance. Example 8 Synthesis of DNA coding for Prepro S2 The plasmid pBR322 pLaS2 or the other transfer vectors containing the Prepro S2 insert prepared in the preceding examples is digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme as indicated in Example 7 A or 7 B and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis.Removal of the 5 untranslated region is performed usingT4 polymerase as described in Example 7 A except that it is conducted in the presence of dATP. The reaction is stopped as described in Example 7 A . The DNA is extracted with phenol and precipitated. Excess dATP and the digested bases are removed by chromatography on 6 50Sepadex. T4 polymerase is added to the DNA and incubated for 0.25 minutes before dATP is added to stop the digestion at the T preceding the start codon. The reaction is stopped and the DNA is extracted and chromatographed as described above. A final digestion with T4 polymerase in the presence of dTTP is conducted.The treated DNA is recovered by ethanol precipitation and digested with S1 nuclease to provide blunt ends as previously described. This yields a DNA which begins with the start codon at the position numbered 111. Example 9 Synthesis of DNA coding for S1 The insert coding for Prepro S1 is removed by digestion of the transfer vectors prepared in the preceding Examples with the appropriate restriction enzymes as indicated in Example 7 A or 7 B . The insert is then digested with Xma I and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. The purified insert DNA is then digested with T4 polymerase in the presence of dATP as described in Example 7 CA . The reaction is stopped, the treated DNA recovered and digested with S1 nuclease to provide blunt ends as described in Example 7 A . This procedure yields a DNA coding for all of S1 except the two N terminal amino acids.A nucleotide sequence coding for these two amino acids is chemically synthesized by the procedure of Itakura, K. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4592 1975 and Itakura, K. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 97, 7326 1975 . This sequence is then blunt end ligated to the remainder of the Sl coding sequence by the procedure of Valenzuela, P., et al., Nature 280, 815 1979 . This yields the complete coding sequence for Si. Example 10 Synthesis of DNA coding for S2 The insert coding for Prepro S2 is removed by digestion of the transfer vectors prepared in the preceding Examples with the appropriate restriction enzymes as indicated in Example 7 A or 7 B . The insert is then digested with the restriction enzyme Ava II orHgi CII or Hgi EII. A frament of DNA of about 120 base pairs in length which begins at the third base in the codon at position 15 of Prepro S2 and continues into the 3 untranslated region is isolated by gel electrophoresis.This fragment is then digested with T4 polymerase as described in Examples 7 A and 9 using five cycles following the format described in Example 8. These cycles are conducted in the presence of dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP, respectively. After the final T4 polymerase digestion, the DNA is recovered by ethanol precipitation and digested with S1 nuclease to provide blunt ends as described in Example 7 A . This yields the complete coding sequence for S2. Example 11 A The deoxynucleotide sequence coding for Pregro S1 prepared in Examples 7 A and 7 B , i.e., Prqpro S1 beginning at the start codon, is inserted into transfer vectors by following procedures described in Examples 1, 3 A , 3 B , 4 A I , 5 A , 5 B and 6. All coniditions are identical to those described. The DNA is removed with the appropriate restriction enzyme, for example as shown in Table 3, and analyzed as described inExample 2. A DNA having the sequence beginning at the start codon at position 107 and continuing to the end of the sequence shown for pLaSl in Figure 3 is obtained in eacs instance. B The deoxynucleotide sequence coding forPrepro S2 prepared in Example 8, i.e., Prepro S2 beginning at the start codon, is inserted into transfer vectors, removed and analyzed as described in Example llW . A DNA having the sequence beginning at the start codon at position 111 and continuing to the end of the sequence shown for pLaS2 in Figure 3 is obtained in each instance. C The deoxynucleotide sequence coding for S1 prepared in Example 9 is inserted into transfer vectors, removed and analyzed as described in Example 11 A . A DNA having the sequence shown for S1 Somatostatin I in Figure 3 is obtained in each instance. D The deoxynucleotide sequence coding for S2 prepared in Example 10 is inserted into transfer vectors, removed and analyzed as described in Example 11 A . A DNA having the sequence shown for S2 Somatostatin II in Figuge 3 is obtained in each instance. Example 12 The various coding regions described herein can be expressed by any of the methods described above. A Expression of Prepro S1 as a fusion protein is demonstrated by incorporation of a radioactive amino acid into a protein not present in untransformed cells or by radioimmunoassay. In both instances, bacterial cells containing pBR322 pLaSl, prepared inExample 1, or bacterial cells containing pBR322 as the control are grown in nutrient broth. In the former procedure, after three hours of growth, 1.5 ml of cells are radioactively labelled by addition of 20,cm Ci 35 methionine and incubated for 10 minutes. The cells are then collected by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in 250 Sul of buffer containing glycol 10 v v , ss mercaptoethanol 5 v v , and SDS 2.38 w v in 0.0625M tris pH 6.8.The suspension is boiled for five minutes, then applied to a 10 tw v SDS polyacrylamide gel and fractionated by electrophoresis. The protein bands are visualized by autoradiography. The results show the existence of a new protein band not observed in non transformed cultures. In the radioimmunoassay procedure, the bacterial cells are collected after growth by centrifugation. The cells are resuspended, lysed and radiolabelled antibody to S1 that does not depend upon a free Nterminal group at position 1 of S1 Arimura, A., et al.,Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 148, 784 1975 is added.The immune complex is precipitated and radioactivity measured. A position reaction is obtained, indicating the production of a fusion protein containing Prepro S1. B For the direct expression of Prepro S1, the insert pLaSl is modified as described in Example 7 A or 7 B or the modified insert is removed from the transfer vectors prepared in Example 11 A . A vector for direct expression is constructed by modification of the plasmid ptrpE30 by the removal of 23 29 nucleotides using T4 polymerase and S1 nuclease as described above. Both the modified pLaS1 insert and the modified expression vector are provided with a specific linker oligonucleotide having the sequence 5l CCGGATCCGG 3 on one strand and its complementary sequence on the other, by blunt end ligation using DNA ligase as described byValenzuela et al., Nature, 280, 815 1979 . The linker oligonucleotides provide restriction sites sensitive to Bam HI endonuclease which are employed to facilitate insertion. The insertion reaction is carried out essentially as described by Ullrich, A., et al., supra. Host bacteria, E. coli KB101, RRI or alpha 1776, are transformed by the recombinant vectors bearing the inserted modified Prepro S1 coding region, and transformants are selected for resistance to ampicillin.A single transformant selected for further analysis is designated ptrpE30 PPSl. Bacterial cells transformed by ptrpE30 PPSl are grown in a standard minimal medium M9 supplemented with leucine, proline, vitamin B1 and ampicillin, at 37 C. In early log phase, the trp operon is induced by addition of beta indolylacrfic acid 30 g ml g ml of medium . Control cultures are let induced. After three more hours of growth, 1.5 ml G cells are radioactively labeled hy addition of 20 Ci 35S L methionine and incubation for iC rjnucs The cells are ten collected by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in 250 Al of buffer containing blycol 10 v v , ss beta mercaptoethanol 5 v v , and SDS 2.3t w v in 0.0625M tris pH 6.8.The suspension is boiled for five minutes, then applied to a 10 w v SDS polyacrylamide gel and fractionated by electrophoresis. The protein bands are visualized by autoradiography. The results show the existence of a new protein band of about 13,000 molecular weight, not observed in uninduced or non transformed cultures. Prepro S1 is purified by conventional techniques including, for example, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and differential solubility techniques. Prepro S1 is converted to Pro S1 by following the procedure described byJackson, R.C., et al., supra. C Prepro S2 is expressed either as a fusion protein or directly by following the procedure described in Example 12 A or 12 B , respectively, using pBR322 pLaS2 or the modified pLaS2 insert, respectivelyProduction of a fusion protein containing Prepro S2 or production of Prepro S2 directly is determined by radioactive amino acid incorporation. The procedure is identical to that described in Example 12 A or 12 B except that radiolabelled tyrosine is used in place of the radiolabelled methionine. The results show the existence of a protein band not observed in nontransformed cultures for the production of a fusion protein, and the existence of a protein band of about 14,100 molecular weight not observed in uninduced or non transformed cultures for the production of PreproS2. D A specific linker having the sequence 5 CCGGATCCGGATG 3 on one strand and its complementary sequence on the other is blunt end ligated to the DNA coding for S1 cr S2 as prepared in Examples 9 and 10, respectively. This modified DNA is then inserted in the modified plasmid ptrpE30 as described in Example 12 B . Host bacteria are transformed and cultured and analyzed as described in Example 12 B or 12 C , respectively. The results indicate the production of S1 or S2. This is confirmed by an amino acid analysis.
