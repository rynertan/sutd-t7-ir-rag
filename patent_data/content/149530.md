# SELF SHARPENING DRAG BIT ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A self sharpening rotary drag bit assembly in which a carrier body adapted to be rotated about a first axis, has a drilling end and carries cutters to be exposed for cutting at the drilling end of the body, the cutters having thereon layers of hard materials defining cutting edges to engage and cut the drilled formation as the body rotates, the cutters also including reinforcement material supporting the layers to resist deflection thereof under cutting loads. The reinforce ment material, which is less hard the and the cutting lauers, and the body which is less hard than the reinforcement material, are abradable by the formation as the bit drilling end rotates in engagement with the formation. Thus the cutting edges are sort sharpening as the bit wears away.
