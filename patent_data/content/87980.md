# Method of selective hydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A mixture of a highly unsaturated hydrocarbons having at least 2 double bonds or at least 1 triple bond e.g. 1,3 butadiene, propadiene, vinylacetylene and b hydrocar bons having 4 or more C atoms e.g. butane, butene is contacted in a fixed bed reactor containing a catalyst, e.g. palladium, with hydrogen gas in amount of 1 to 3 moles per mole of unsaturated hydrocarbons a the H₂ is supplied at at least two, preferably two or three, points along the length of the vessel. Two or more vessels can be connected in series, or a single vessel can be divided into separate catalyst zones between which H₂ is fed. Reaction in vapour phase is red. The method provides hydrogenation of the highly unsaturated hydrocarbons, without isomerization of olefinic double bonds which can reduce the proportion of 1 butene.
