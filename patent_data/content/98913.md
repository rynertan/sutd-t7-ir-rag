# Movement sensor

## Abstract
Movement sensor includes a conductor body of the electricity which moves easily over a support the latter also having fixed elements of the electricity. When the mobile conductor body moves over the fixed conductor elements, successive electrical contacts are established. This permits to establish as many different switches as desired throughout the path of the mobile body. With the body placed in a determined position and in an inoperative situation, the mobile conductor body will be positioned at a point of the support which supposes a stable equilibrum. In this situa tion, the mobile conductor body will seek a new stable position and travel a certain space throughout a curved path, closing switches in its run. The fact that it closes switches at a determined point of the path does not indicate movement. The fact that it closes, at successive times, switches in different zones means that a displacement of the conductor body has been produced, that is, movement of the sensor. The distance between the zones wherein closing of the switches has been produced indicates amplitude of the movement. If the support presents different curvature radii in different zones, a different sensitivity will correspond to each zone. With the mobile conductor body in a zone of great curvature radius, a slight movement will produce a great displacement of the mobile body on the support and, consequently, the closing, at different times, of various switches. An alarm system comprising the movement sensor is also described.
