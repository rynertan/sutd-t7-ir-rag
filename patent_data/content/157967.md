## Description
REK Y.ABLE LOCK METHOD AND APPARATUS BACKGROUND OF TEE INVENTION The present invention is related to locks and, more specifically, to a method and apparatus for rekeying cylinder locks with tumbler pins without having to disassemble to lock apparatus. The most common type of lock in use at the present time, particularly on door latches in buildings, is the tumbler pin lock. Such a lock usually includes a lock cylinder housing with a cylindrica bore extending longitudinally therethrough, a cylindrical core positioned rotatably in the bore and having a longitudinal keyway therein for receiving a key bit. A plurality of top pin chambers are positioned in the cylinder housing perpendicular to and extending radially outward from the cylindrical bore, and correspondingly spaced bottom pin chambers are positioned in the core. Top pins are generally.positioned in the bottom pin chambers, although top pins can move partially into bottom chambers and bottom pins can move partially into top chambers when the core is rotated to align corresponding top and bottom chambers with each other.In fact, a pin positioned partially in a top pin chamber and partially in a bottom pin chamber across the shear plane between the cylinder housing and the rotatable core prohibits the core from being rotated and provides the locking effect of the lock mechanism. Typically, the lengths of the individual bottom pins are selected to establish the keying requirements of the lock. In order for a key to open the lock, it must have a key bit with bitting and spacing thereon cut to correspnd inversely to the bottom pin lengths. The fitting must be cut and spaced such that when the key is inserted into the keyway the bittig acts on the bottom pins to align all of the interfaces between the top pins and bottom pins respectively with the shear plane between the core and the cylinder housing. When all of the interfaces between the top and bottom pins are align with the shear plane, the core can be turned to operate a lock or latch mechanism.However, if a properly cut key bit is not positioned in the core, at least one top tumbler pin is positioned across the shear plane, and the core cannot be rotated within the cylinder housing. Haster key arrangements are also available in such conventional cylinder locks. For example, a plurality of cylinder locks can be provided, each lock having a separate keying arrangement that reguires a unique key bit to open the lock, as well as being openable by a common master key that is capable of opening all of the locks in the set. Such master key lock devices are basically of the same construction as that described above, with the exetion that master wafers or spacers are positioned between one or more of the top and bottom pin sets to provide more than one interfacing surface for alignment with the shear plane.For example, one master wafer positioned between a top and a bottom pin in such a lock provides one potential interface at the top of the wafer and another pctential interface at the bottom of the wafer. The master key can be provided with bitting and spacing to align the interface at the bottom of the master wafer with the shear plane in order to rotate the core, and a different individual key can be provided kith bitting and spacing to align the interface at the top of tht wafer with the shear plane to also rotate the core. When one desires to rekey such conventiona cylinder locks, the cylinder and core must be disassembled, the bottom pins removed and replaced with a different set of bottom pins of different selected lengths. Such a process is tulle consuming and usually requires the services of a locksmith to yIrform properly.Unfortunately, there are situations in which rektfing is required quite often. For example, in apartments and olcice buildings, there may be frequent turnover of tenants, which requires frequent lock changes. In some other security applications, locks are changed periodically as a matter of policy. In such applications, the cost of rekeying can be a significant expense.A method and apparatus for rekeying such locks easily and without disassembly could substantially reduce the cost and inconvenience of rekeying locks. SUMMARY OF TRE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel rekeyable cylinder lock apparatus that can be rekeyed by unskilled persons and without requiring disassembly of the lock. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a cylinder lock apparatus that can be rekeyed a preselected number of times for use with a set of precut keys. Another object of the present invention is to provide a key bit device that can be used to rekey a lock tumbler pin type cylinder lock that has spacer wafers positioned between sets of top and bottom tumbler pins. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method of rekeying a cylinder lock provided with top and bottom tumbler pins without having to disassemble the lock. In the rekeyable lock apparatus of the present invention, at least one spacer member, preferably in the form of a master wafer, is positioned in the bottom pin chamber between the top and bottom pins for providing two separate interfaces between the top and bottom pins, each of which interfaces is adapted for alignment with the shear plane between the core and the cylinder housing. The spacer wafer has a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the tumbler pins. A device is also provided for removing the spacer member from the pinchamber and ejecting it out of the lock apparatus.The removal device preferably includes an elongated key bit adapted for insertion into the keyway and having bitting thereon adapted to move the spacer member into the top pin chamber and position it with the interface between the spacer member and the bottom pin aligned with the shear plane so that the core can be rotated within the cylinder housing. The key bit is also provided with a cut therein opposite the bitting and of a depth corresponding to the thickness of the spacer member. The cut is adapted to receive the spacer member therein when aligned with the top pin chamber in whch the spacer member is positioned by the key bit. When the spacer member is captured in the cut, the key bit can remove it from the pin chamber and carry it out of the core as the key bit is withdrawn from the tore. he rekeyable lock apparatus can also include a plurality of rekeying combinations. One or more spacer member can be positioned in all or selected ones of the pin chambers between the top and bottom pins therein. A corresponding number of keys can be provided with each key bit having bitting thereon adapted tff position selected ones of the spacer members into the top pin chambers. Each of said keys, of course, would also be provided with a cut on the opposite side of each key bit spaced to correspond to the bitting and the pin chamber form which the spacer member is desired to be removed. Each cut is preferably longer than the diameter of its associated spacer wafer while, at the same time is shorter than the diameter of its associated tumbler pins. Also, a set of useable keys can be provided for individual use without the cuts on the opposite sides of the key bits, but with appropriate bittings thereon to operate the lock according to the keying arrangements resulting from each rekeying operation. The method of rekeying a cylinder lock apparatus according to the present invention includes the steps of inserting into the keyway of a cylinder lock a key bit having bitting thereon adapted to position the spacer member into the top pin chamber such that the bottom surface of the spacer member is aligned with the shear plane and wherein the key bit has a cut therein opposite the bitting of a depth corresponding to the thickness of the spacer member, and a length longer than the diameter of the spacer member yet shorter than the diameter of the tumbler pins, rotating the key bit and core in the housing to align the cut with the top pinchamber and allowing the spacer member to move out of the top pin chamber and into loose fitting engagement with the cut, rotating the key bit and core again with the spacer member captured in the cut to remove the spacer member from the pin chamber and to align the top pin chamber with the bottom pin chamber again, and removing the key bit from the core 4 k the spacer member captured in the cut to extract the spacer member from the lock apparatus. This invention also includes a rekeying device adapted for zek.eying the lock by inserting a spacer member into a pin chamber between a set of upper and lower pins without disassembling the lock. In addition to a key bit with a cut therein opposite the bitting as described above, it includes a device in the cut for forcing the spacer member out of the cut and into the top pin chamber. One example of such a device is a spring member positioned in the cut which has an inherent strength greater than the strength of the spring in the top pin chamber above the top tumbler pin in the lock. With such a device, a spacer member can be positioned in the cut, inserted into the keyway along with the rekeying device, and turned into alignment with the pin chamber.At that point the spring in the cut forces the spacer member out of the cut and into the pin chamber to rekey the lock. Then the rekeying device can be removed from the keyway.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMISNT A rekeyable lock cylinder 10 according to the present invention is shown in Figures 1 and 2 with a conventional key 60 adapted to open the lock. The cylinder lock 10 is shown in elevation in these figures with strips or slots of the cylinder housing 11 and core 12 cut away to reveal the pin chambers therein.for clarity. These components will be described inmore detail below. A substantial portion of the structure shown is conventional for cylinder type locks and will be described first for purposes of background and clarity in presenting the improvements of this invention. The cylinder housing 11 has a lower portion 13 and an upper portion 14. A cylindrical core 12 is rotatably positioned in a cylindrical bore 15 in the lower portion 13 of the cylinder housing 11. A retainer 56 is attached to the rear end of the core 12 for retaining the core 12 inthe cylinder housing 11 and for attaching a tail piece 58 to the core 12. The tail piece 58 is a mechanical linkage adapted for engagement with any latch mechanism, such as a door latch, intended to be locked or opened by the lock 10. The upper portion 14 of the cylinder housing 11 includes a plurality of vertical top pin chambers 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 therein positioned in spaced apart relation to each other in a common plane and extending radially outward from the cylindrical bore 15. Elongated top tumbler pins 30, 32, 34, 36, 40 are slideably positioned in respective top pin chambers 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26. Each top tumbler pin 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 is preferably, but not necessarily, the same length as the others.Compression springs 43, 44, 4 46, 47, 48 are positioned in respective top pin chambers 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 above the respective top tumbler pins 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 therein to bias these top tumbler pins downwardly toward the core 12. The core 12 also has a plurality of bottom pin chambers 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 extending radially from the peripheral surface of the core 12 into the keyway. The bottom pin chambers 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 27 are all in a common plane and spaced to align with the respective corresponding top pin chambers 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 when the core 12 is rotated to the upright position as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Elongated bottom tumbler pins 31, 33, 35, 37,.39, 41 are slideably positioned in respective bottom pin chambers 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27. Unlike the top tumbler pins, however, the bottom tumbler pins usually of different lengths, the combination of the lengths of the bottom pins determining the keying of the lock.When there is not a key in the keyway, the lower end of the bottom tumbler pins 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 rest on the ledge 54 in the keyway, and the top tumbler pins 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 are positioned across the shear line 52 between the core 12 and the cylinder housing 11. When any one of the top or bottom pins is positi oned across the shear line 52, the core 12 cannot be turned and the lock cannot be opened. However, when the tumbler pins are positioned so that none of the pins are positioned across the shear line 52, as shown in Figure 2, the key 60 can be turned and the lock can be opened. As shown in Figure 2, the key bit 61 of key 60 is inserted in the keyway in the core 12. The bitting on the key bit 61 are cut and spaced corresponding to the length of the respective bottom pins 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 such that the interfaces between the corresponding top pins and the bottom pins all align with the shear plane 52. In this configuration as shown inFigure 2 rotor 12 can be turned and the lock can be opened with key 60. In order to provide rekeying capability according to this invention, removable spacers are positioned between one or more of the top and bottom tumbler pin sets in the lock. For example, as shown in Figures 1 through 3, two spacer members 50, 51 in the form of thin, cylindrical wafers are positioned between top pin 32 and bottom pin 33 in the second pin chamber. Each of the spacer members 50, 51 has a diameter smaller than the corresponding tumbler pins 32, 33. As best seen in Figure 2, the first conventional key 60 has a bitting 62 in the second position thereon cut to position the interface 49 between the top pin 32 and wafer 50 in alignment with shear plane 52. The bitting also positions the interfaces between the remaining top and bottom pin sets in alignment with the shear plane 52 in the conventional manner so that the core 12 can be turned and the lock opened. As shown in Figure 3, a special key 70 is provided for rekeying the lock 10 by removing wafer 50 without disassembling the lock. The bit 71 of the special rekeying key 70 is provided with a bitting 72 in the second position thereof which is higher then the corresponding bitting 62 of the original key 60. The remaining bittings of the special rekeying key 70 are the same as the corresponding bittings of conventional key 60. On the opposite side of the key bit 71, a cut 74 is provided therein of a depth approximately equal to the thickness of wafer 50. Cut 74 has a length along the key 70 which is shorter than the diameter of pins 32, 33 yet which is longer than the diameter of spacer members 50, 51. Referring now to Figure 4, key bit 71 of rekeying key 70 is shown inserted into the keyway in core 12. Bitting 72 in the second position of key bit 71 is of a suffidient height to position wafer 50 in the top pin chamber 18 with the lower surface or interface 53 thereof aligned with shear plane 52. The remaining bittings are the same as those on key 60, i.e., of such respective heights to position the interfaces between the other top and bottom pin sets in alignment with shear plane 52 also.Therefore, in the position shown in Figure 4, the rekeying key 70 can be used to rotate core 12 within cylinder housing 11 1800 to the position shown in Figure 5. With the rekeying key 70 and core 12 rotated 1800 to the position shown in Figure 5, all of the bottom pins, including bottom pin 33 and wafer 51, positioned in core 12 are rotated away from the top pin chambers. At the same time, cut 74 is rotated to a position in alignment with top pin chamber 18. When cut 74 is aligned with top pin chamber 18, spring 44 pushes such wafer 50 out of top pin chamber 18 and into loose fitting engagement with cut 74. Since the depth of cut 74 is approximately equal to the thickness of wafer 50, the interface 49 between top pin 32 and wafer 50 is aligned with shear plane 52.Therefore, the shear plane 52 remains uninterrupted and the rekeying key 70 can be rotatei back 1800 to the position shown inFigure 6. The configuration shown in Figure 6 is substantially the same as the configuration shown in Figure 4, with the exception that wafer 50 is captured in the cut 74 and is removed from its former position under top pin 32. As shown in Figure 7, the key bit 71 of key 70 can then be pulled out of the keyway in core 12. As the key bit 71 is removed from core 12, the wafer 50 is also pulled out of the keyway by cut 74 and can be discarded. Therefore, only wafer 51 remains positioned between top pin 32 and bottom pin 33 as shown in Figure 7. The effect of the removal of wafer 50 as described above is that the lock is rekeyed. To illustrate the effect of the rekeying by removal of wafer 50, Figure 8 shows the original key 60 again inserted into the core 12. As shown in Figure 8, bitting 62 of the original key 60 is now of an insufficient height to push bottompin 33 upward far enough to align an interface with shear plane 52. Therefore, top pin 32 is positioned across shear plane 52 and the core 12 can no longer be turned by the original key 60. Of course, a key with the same bitting as key 70, but not including cut 74, would still be operative to turn the core 12 and open the lock. The sizing of the spacer members and the rekey cuts which receive thespacer members for removal can not be more fully appreciated. Since it is desirable to eliminate the danger of jamming the special key in the lock, the cuts which receives the spacer members are sized to receive the spacer members in loosefitting engagement. This helps eliminate the danger that a spacer member will only partially enter the cut and become wedged in a position interrupting the shear line. Further, the cuts are under sized with respect to the pins to prevent the top pins from becoming engaged with the cuts.Were this sizing not provided1 the inadvertent insertion and rotation of a special key in the lock would cause both the lock to jam and the key to become jammed in the lock since a top pin would become lodged in the rekeying cut and therefore interrupt the shear line with the lock in a rotated orientation. As shown in Figures 9 and 10, the lock 10 can be rekeyed again to a still different configuration by the use of a second rekeying key 80. Key bit 81 of rekeying key 80 is provided with a still higher bitting 82 in the second position, which is effective to position wafer 51 into the top pin chamber 18. The bottom surface of wafer 51, i.e., interface 55, is now aligned with shear plane 52. A cut 84 is provided in the opposite side of key bit 81 to capture wafer 51 when the core 12 is rotated 1800 as shown in Figure 10. Of course, as described above for key 70, with the wafer 51 captured in cut 84 and interface 53 aligned with shear plane 52, the rotor 12 can be turned back 1800, as shown in Figure 11 to remove wafer 51 from the pin chambers. Then, as shown in Figure 12, the rekeying key 80 can be withdrawn from the core 12 to pull wafer 51 out of the lock to effect a second rekeying of the lock 10. With the principle structure thus explained and illustrated, it is not necessary to further illustrate that a large number of rekeying sequences can be effected by the principle of this invention. A plurality of up to J or 5 individual wafers can be positioned in each or any number of selected ones of the lower pin chambers 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 in conventional cylinder locks. A rekeying master key can then be provided with appropriate bitting thereon for removal of one each of the individual wafers at a time. Each such removal of a wafer would result in rekeying the lock.For example, if each of the six bottom pin chambers 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 was provided with two wafers apiece and respective corresponding rekeying keys, the lock 10 could be rekeyed 12 times according to the method of this invention without requiring disassembly of the lock or changing tumbler pins. It should also be mentioned that the apparatus and method of this invention is conducive to the use of a master key that is capable of opening the lock with any of the selected key combinations by providing bitting thereon of appropriate heights to position the top surfaces of all the bottom pins in alignment with shear plane 52. Also, intermediate master keys can also be provided which position the top surface of one or more of the wafers in alighment with shear plane 52. Then, as a latter stage of evolution, with the appropriate master rekeying key, the lock could be rekeyed so that even such an intermediate master key would no longer be effective to open the lock. In another embodiment of this invention, as shown in Figures 13 through 15, a rekeying device 90 is provided that can be used to rekey the lock by inserting spacer members back into the pin chambers in the lock. The rekeying device 90 has a key bit 91 with bitting thereon adapted to open the lock, i.e., align the interfaces under the top pins with the shear line 52 so the core 12 can be turned. Again, the description here is focused on rekeying the second tumbler pin set position, although the same principle applies to rekeying any other pin set or combinations of pin sets in the lock. The second position bitting 92 is of sufficient height to push top pin 32 and bottom pin 33 upwardly such that the lower surface of top pin 32 aligns with shear plane 52. A cut 94 in key bit 91 opposite bitting 92 has a leaf spring 95 mounted therein and is adapted to receive therein a spacer member 51 against the bias of the spring 95, as shown in Figure 13. The leaf spring 95 has more inherent bias strength than the pin springs in the lock for purposes described more fully below.When the spacer member 51 is positioned in the cut 94 and inserted into the keyway in core 12, as shown in Figure 14, the interior wall of the cylinder housing 13 retains it in the cut 94. Note also in Figure 14 that the bitting on the key bit 91 has positioned all of the tumbler pin interfaces in alignment with the shear plane 52 so that the core 12 can be rotated within the cylinder housing 13. When the core 12 is rotated to the position shown in Figure 15 so the cut 94 is aligned with top pin chamber 18, the leaf spring 95 forces spacer member 51 into top pin chamber 18 against the bias of pin spring 44. As mentioned above, the leaf spring 95 is inherently stronger than pin spring 44 so that it is capable of pushing the spacer member 51 out of cut 94 and into the pin chamber 18. Leaf spring 95 is also shaped such that its distal end only extends upwardly in cut 94 to a position flush with the edge of the key bit 91 so that it does not protrude through shear plane 52. Therefore, the leaf spring 95 is effective to position spacer member 51 into the top pin chamber 18 with its bottom surface aligned with shear plane 52.Then, the core 12 can be rotated back 1800 to realign the top and bottom pin chambers with each other so that the key bit 91 of the rekeying device 90 can be removed from the core 12 leaving the lock rekeyed. Of course, a plurality of spacer members can be positioned in one or more pin chambers in any combination desired with this rekeying device as long as appropriate bitting is provided to rotate the core. Therefore, a large number of rekeying possibilities exist. In fact, if rekeying devices for removing spacer members, such as the device 70 shown in Figure 3, are used in combination with rekeying devices for inserting spacers, such as that shown in Figure 13, a tumbler pin cylinder lock can be rekeved almost indefinitely without having to disassemble the lock. Another advantage of rekeying locks according to this invention is that the operator can always know positively that the lock has been successfully rekeyed. In rekeying by removing a spacer member, the spacer member is pulled out the front of the core where it can be seen. When the spacer member is pulled out, the operator can see that the lock has been rekeyed. On the other hand, in rekeying by inserting a spacer member into the pin chamber, when the rekeying device is pulled out of the core without the spacer member, the operator will know that the lock has been rekeyed. There is no place for the spacer member to go in the lock other than into the pin chamber. Although the present invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made four clarity and example and that changes in details of structure may be made without departing from the scope of the claims hereof.
