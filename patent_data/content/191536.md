# Synthetic immunogen.

## Abstract
The present invention concerns novel immunogens. These immunogens comprise novel compounds which consist of an antigen or antigenic determinant coupled to an amphiphilic adjuvant molecule and optionally also free amphiphilic adjuvant molecules. An advantageous feature of these novel immunogens is the presence of both an excellent immunogen activity as well as a pronounced adjuvant activity in a single complex.
