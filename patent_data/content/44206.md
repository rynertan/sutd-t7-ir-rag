# HEAT SEALING PROCESSES AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Processes and apparatus for heat sealing materials together include the step of subjecting the materials to a sealing area providing a fluid bearing flow regime to produce a required heat, pressure and dwell time profile for sealing. A preferred embodiment includes a dual zone porous surface for supplying both heating and cooling fluids to the materials while they are subjected to a preferred pressure profile, thereby reducing tension in the softened or molten materials and reducing the time the materials must remain molten. The dual zone process may be used in different heat sealing flow regimes.
