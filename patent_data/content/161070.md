# Apparatus and methods for providing a regulated flow of plastic materials such as dough.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for quantifying the flow rate of e.g. dough 3 by controlling the speed of a feed conveyor 15 when the dough is transferred from the feed conveyor 15 onto a constant speed conveyor 21 . The dough is weighed by a device 13 and the movement of the feed conveyor is controlled at a speed inversely proportional to the weight measurements. The dough is consequently stretched or compressed cooperatively with two pressing means such as rollers 25,29 to make constant the weight of dough per unit length.
