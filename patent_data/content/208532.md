## Description
Core Sampling Device. The present invention relates to a core sampling device, in particular a drill bit and core barrel assembly for a wire line drilling method of obtaining core samples. In a commonly known wire line core sampling device, the drill bit comprises effectively an annular cutting device which cuts an annular or cylindrical hole. This hole defines a core which is captured within a core barrel for sampling. Devices of this kind suffer the disadvantage that it is not possible to change the drill bit e.g. to accommodate changes in geological conditions or simply to replace a worn bit, without withdrawing the entire drill line. It is an object of the present invention to provide a core sampling device in which the drill bit can be changed without withdrawing the entire drill line. According to the invention there is provided a core sampling device comprising a drill bit assembly, a drive shoe arranged to house the drill bit, and a core sampling tube the drill bit assembly including a bit housing, which is drivingly engaged by the drive shoe, and a series of drill segments which are pivotally attached to the housing to be capable of pivoting between a drilling position in which the outer and inner radial limits of the segments define the outer and inner diameters of an annular hole to be drilled, and a retracted position in which the segments are entirely within the diameter of the drive shoe the segments being maintained in the drilling position by the core sampling tube when this is in a forward position, and the segments being allowed to adopt the retracted position when the sampling tube is withdrawn the core sampling tube engaging the drill bit assembly whereby continued withdrawal of the core sampling tube causes withdrawal of the drill bit assembly from within the drive shoe. Thus, the bit can be removed together with the core, without having to withdraw the entire drill line. Preferably, the device includes a retraction tube which is connected to the drill bit housing and which is engaged by the core sampling tube on its withdrawal in order to withdraw the drill bit assembly. Preferably, the core sampling tube houses a core spring. Preferably, the drive shoe has a screw thread for connection to an outer tube of a drill line and the core sampling tube has connecting means for connection to an inner tube of a drill line. Preferably, the said connecting means provides a connection allowing a limited rocking movement between the core sampling tube and the inner tube. It will be appreciated that the preferred construction may ensure correct movement of the bit segments into their correct mode. It will also provide a sufficient degree of freedom to accommodate the core without damaging the core, and also allows a considerable flow of lubricant for cooling and the removal of pulverised material. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways and one embodiment will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal section through a sampling device according to the invention in its drilling mode FIGURE 2 is a view similar to FIGURE 1 with the device in its retracted mode FIGURE 3 is a partial cut away view of a drive shoe FIGURE 4 is a partial cutaway view of a bit body FIGURE 5 is an end view of the device in its drilling mode and FIGURE 6 is an end view of the device in its retracted mode. The drill line at the bit end is shown schematically as comprising an outer tube 11 and an inner tube 12. The sampling device comprises a drive shoe and reaming shell 13, a bit 14, a core spring carrier tube 15 housing a core spring 16, and a perforated retraction tube 17. The drive shoe 13 is connected to the outer tube 11 by a screw thread connection 18. The bit 14 comprises a bit housing 19 and a series in this case 3 of hinged cutting segments 21. A retaining spring 22 holds the bit elements together. The spring carrier 15 is connected to the inner tube 12 via a swivel attachment 23 which is threadably connected to the spring carrier 15 and connected to the inner tube 12. When the device is in its drilling mode, the 30carrier tube 15 is located in a forward position as shown in FIGURE 1. In this position, the segments 21 are forced to adopt an outwardly extended orientation by the forward portion of the tube 15, so that the radially outer extent of the cutting segments 21 define the outer diameter of the annular hole which is to be cut, while the radially inner extent of the segments 21 define the inner diameter of the annular hole. The drive to the bit is supplied by the outer tube 11 which drives the drive shoe 13 which in turn drives the bit housing 19 through driving keys 25 which co operate with corresponding keys 26 in the bit housing. These components rotate relative to the inner tube 12 10and carrier tube 15. The shoe 13 also has an appropriate number of guides 27 in the form of fixed or free balls which guide the segments 21 into the correct position for drilling. As drilling proceeds and the drill line descends through rock strata, the segments 21 cut an annular hole. The pulverised material is removed by means of water which is pumped to the drilling position and which passes back to the surface around the outside of the drill line. Its passage is aided by the fact that the retraction tube 17 is perforated. The rock core thus produced effectively passes up the centre of the carrier tube 15. Any non alignment is accommodated by the free ball lock 24 allowing relative movement of the tube 15. When it becomes desirable to remove the core and or the drill bit 14, drilling is stopped and the inner tube 12 is drawn upwards. This withdraws the carrier tube 15 together with the core, which is held in position by the spring 16. Withdrawal of the carrier tube allows the segments 21 to pivot inwards so that their radially outward margins are contained within the diameter of the drive shoe 13. Continued withdrawal of the inner tube 12 and the carrier tube 15 causes the swivel attachment 23 to abut an inwardly extending flange 28 at the end of the retraction tube 17. Further withdrawal draws up the retraction tube 17 and also the drill bit 14 which is connected to the retraction tube 17 by means of a screw thread connection 29 between the tube 17 and the bit housing 19. Thus, the drill bit 14 can be changed if required without the necessity of removing the entire drill line. The bit can have a cutting faces kerf which are surface set with diamonds, or matrix impregnated with diamond grit. Alternatively, the cutting medium may be a hard material such as tungsten carbide or indeed the bit 14 can carry pads which are of tungsten carbide faced with diamond grit, as may be appropriate to the geological conditions. The use of the perforated tube 17 allows continuous fluid throughput, notwithstanding the additional metal elements which are extra over and 20above those which would be used in a wire line barrel without a retractable bit
