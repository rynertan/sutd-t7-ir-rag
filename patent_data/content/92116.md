## Description
CLIPPER CIRCUIT AND SIGNAL COMPARATOR EMPLOYING SAME Background and Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a clipper circuit and a signal comparator employing the clipper circuit for input protection. Clipper circuits are electronic circuits which automatically limit the instantaneous amplitude of an electrical signal to a predetermined maximum or minimum value. Various types of clipper circuits are disclosed in the patent to Ort, U.S. Patent No. 2,980,806. Clipper circuits are often employed to protect other electrical circuits whose operation might be desirably affected by signal levels beyond the boundary established by the clipper. Clippers have been employed, for example, to protect one or both of the inputs of the signal comparator circuits used as zero crossing detectors. The patents toMartin, U.S. Patent No. 3,593,166 and Matouka, U.S. Patent No. 3,697,782 disclose zero crossing de cctorc ciployiilglg clippers for protection of coiparator circuits.These prior clipper circuits are not suitable for some applications, however, since they do not clip the input signal precisely at the desired boundary level. One example of an application where precise clipping of an input signal is required is where the comparator of a zero crossing detector is operated from a single voltage power supply. A comparator, when operated from a single supply, will normally have one of its power supply terminals grounded and the other power supply terminal connected to the positive terminal of the power supply. If the applied AC signal drops below ground potential, it is no longer within the power supply range of the comparator. The comparator may respond to this in an abnormal manner. If the comparator is a conventional integrated circuit such as the LM139 manufactured by National SemiconductorCorporation of Santa Clara, California , for example, the negative input signal can and will produce parasitic action between the two comparator inputs which in turn causes the comparator output to switch to an erroneous level. Even relatively small negative excursions of the input signal e.g., .3 volts can cause such action.Hence the input must be rather precisely clipped at ground potential. Conventional clipper designs cannot readily be adapted to provide precise clipping at ground potential. SL i.fl QaLy of thc Inventj.on The present invention provides a clipping circuit which provides precise clipping of the input signal at a reference potential such as ground whereby it may be used to provide input signal protection of a comparator operated from a single power supply. The clipping apparatus has at least three terminals, including an input terminal upon which an input signal is to be applied, an output terminal and a reference terminal to which a reference voltage e.g., ground. potential is to be applied. The apparatus includes an impedance connected between the input and output terminals and a bipolar junction transistor BJT having its base connected to the input terminal and its collector emitter current path connected between the output terminal and the reference terminal. Whenever the level of the input signal is on one side of the reference voltage level, the transistor. is turned off and the input voltage is transmitted to the output terminal through the impedance. When the level of the input signal is on the other side of the reference voltage level, however, the transistor is turned on and saturated, whereby the output terminal is essentially directly connected to the reference terminal. The volta e appearing at the output terminal will therefore never go beyond the reference voltage. Brief Descr1 L on of the Dxawinqs The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description, as taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a zero crossing detector in a tachometer signal processing system Fig. 2 is a series of waveforms useful in understanding the operation of the Fig. l circuitry Fig. 3 is a circuit scbernatic of one elrbodiment of a clipper circuit for use as an input protection circuit inFig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a circuit schematic of another, and presently preferred embodiment of a precision clipper circuit for use as an input protection circuit in Fig. 1. Detailed Description Fig. 1 illustrates a zero crossing detector 10 which transforms a bipolar signal provided by a tachometer 12 into a squarewave signal for application to a signal processing circuit 14. The tachometer 12 provides a bipolar output signal have a frequency corresponding to the spQe l of rotation of a mechanical part with which the tachometer 12 is associated. This bipolar signal is represented in Fig. 2 as, 11 i not restricted to, a sinusoid. During the first half cycle t of the bipolar signal the output of the tachometer is above ground potential, whereas during the second half cycle t2 the polarity of the tachometer output is reversed, i.e., the tachometer output signal is below ground potential. The function of the zero crossing detector 10 is to convert the bipolar input signal into a bilevel, unipolar output signal suitable for application to the signal processing circuit 14. The desired form of the output signal, provided by the zero crossing detector in response to the bipolar input signal is shown in Fig 2B. During the positive half cycle of the bipolar input signal the output of the zero crossing detector should be at ground potential, whereas during the negative half cycle of the bipolar input signal, the output should be at a fixed positive potential V . The output of the zero crossing detector should transition between the two possible output potentials ground and V at each zero crossing, thus producing a unipolar square wave time correlate of the bipolar input signal. To provide the desired switching between two output levels, the zero crossing detector 10 includes a comparator 16. Tbe comparator 16 is a precision voltage coniparator such as, for example1 one of the four comparators included in an integrated circuit referred to as the LM139, manufactured by National SemiconductorCorporation of Santa Clara, California. The comparator 16 has two power supply terminals 18 and 20 across which a single DC voltage is preferably applied. The terminal 20 is grounded whereas the terminal 18 is connected to the V output of a single voltage, power supply. The comparator 16 includes an inverting input terminal 22, a noninverting terminal 24, and an output terminal 26. The voltage appearing on the output terminal 26 will be one of two levels, depending upon the relative magnitudes of the input signals applied to the two input terminals 22 and 24. As a general rule, the output signal will be at a high logic level V when the signal applied to the noninverting input terminal 24 is greater than the signal applied to the inverting input terminal 22 Similarly, the output will be at a low logic level ground when the signal applied to the inverting input terminal 22 is greater than the signal applied to the noninverting input terminal 24. From the foregoing description of the usual operation of a comparator 16, it seems that the desired output signal cc llld be provirlcd by merely cgrollrlfling the noninverting input terminal 24 and connecting the inverting input terminal 22 to the output of the tachorneter 12. In such a case, one would expect that the output signal would be a squarewave signal having the form shown in Fig. 2B. Unfortunately, the signal of Fig. 2B is not produced. The reason is that the described operation of comparator 16 only holds true as long as the input signals are between the voltage levels applied to the two power supply terminals 18 and 20.If one of the input signals were to move beyond this ranger erroneous transitioning might incur in the comparator output signal. With the LM139 comparator, for example, an output signal such as shown in Fig. 2C will result if the output of the tachometer 12 is directly applied to the inverting input 22 of the comparator 16. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, the output signal remains correctly low as long as the tachometer output is above ground, and correctly switches to a high logic level as soon as the tachometer output signal reaches a ground potential. As the tachometer output signal continues to swing negative and drops below approximately .3 volts, however, parasitic action between the two comparator inputs 22 and 24 causes the output to revert back to a low logic level, where it remains until the tachometer output signal again approaches a ground potential.Because of the reversion to a low logic level, the comparator 16 inci rrcctly provides two output pulses for each cycle of the tachometer output signal To eliminate the erroneous switching, the zero crossing detector 10 includes a protection circuit 28 which is connected between the output 30 of the tachometer 12 and the inverting input 22 of the comparator 16. The purpose of the input protection circuit 28 is to eliminate the negative going lobes of the tachometer output signal, thereby preventing the parasitic action which would otherwise cause erroneous switching of the comparator circuit 16. One form which the input protection circuit 28 may take in accordance with the teachings of the present invention is shown in Fig. 3. The input protection circuit 28 of Fig. 3 comprises a clipper circuit 32 which includes an input terminal 35, an output terminal 38, and a reference voltage terminal 40. The input terminal 36 will be connected to an input device such as tachometer 12 , modeled in Fig. 3 as a signal source 42 connected in series with a resistor 43. The output terminal 38, on the other hand, will be connected to an output device such as signal processor 14 , characterized in Fig. 3 as a resistor 44 connecting the terminal 38 to a V supplySince the output device will normally represent a high impedance, the resistor 44 should be thought of as having a quite high resistance value.The reference terminal 40 will be connected to a reference voltage corresI oniing to the voltage at which the cliing action is to take place. In Fig 3 the reference terminal 40 is shown connected to a ground potential. The clipper circuit 32 includes to elements an impedance 46 connecte between the input terminal 36 and output terminal 38, and a bipolar junction transistor BJT 48 having its collector emitter current path connected between the output terminal 38 and the reference terminal 40, and its base electrode connected to the input terminal 36. In Fig. 3 the impedance 46 takes the form of a resistor, and the transistor 48 is shown as a conventional PNP transistor having its emitter electrode connected to the reference terminal 40 and its collector electrode connected to the output terminal 38. When the input signal applied to the input terminal 36 by signal source 42 is at or above the reference potential applied to reference terminal 40, the base emitter junction of transistor 48 is reverse biased. The base collector junction of transistor 48, on the other hand, is virtually unbiased, meaning that the base and collector potentials are essentially equal. The base terminal 36 and collectbr terminal 38 potentials are approximately the same because resistor 46 is very small compared to the load impedance 44 whereby there is allaost no voltage drop across it. In this circunstance, essentially no current flows through the transistor 48 and it therefore has no effect upon the input signal applied to the input terminal 36.The input signal, unmodified, thus appears at the output terminal 38. When the input signal drops below ground potential, however, the base emitter junction of transistor 48 becomes forward biased, whereby base current flows through the transistor. As the input signal generated by source 42 becomes more and more negative, the voltage on terminals 36 remains fixed at .5 to .7 volts since the voltage across the base emitter junction is almost constant. A transistor is essentially a current amplifierDuring linear operation, the level of collector current is equal to solne fixed gain factor times the level of base current. Consequently, the flow of base current in transistor 48 causes a larger collector current to be created. Since transistor 48 is a P transistor, the direction of the current is from emitter ground, in this case to collector. The collector current passes through the resistor 46, causing the collector voltage to rIse.The collector voltage can only rise about .5 volts, however, before the collector base junction of transistor 48 becomes forward biased, precluding further collector cllrrcnt incrcalses. This coiiition, where both the collector base and hase emitter junctions are forward biased, is referred to as saturation. When 2 transistor is saturated, increases in base current no longer produce corresponding changes in collector current. Typical collector emitter saturation voltages are on the order of .2 volts. Since the voltage at the emitter of the transistor 48 is fixed at ground potential, and since the voltage drop across the collector emitter current path of the transistor 48 is fixed at the saturation voltage, it follows that the voltage at the collector of the transistor 48 will not drop below approximately .2 volts. The transistor will remain in saturation as long as base current exists, which in turn will continue as long as the input voltage is negative. Thus, clipper circuit 28 shown in Fig. 3 passes positive signals without change, but clips negative signals off at ground potential. When the tachometer output signal Fig. 2A is applied to its input, the waveform of Fig. 2D results. The waveform lacks a negative lobe and can therefore be applied to comparator 16 without creating incorrect triggering of the comparator. For ease of understanding, the Fig. 3 circuitry shows the transistor connected for operation in its normal mode, where base emitcer currrent induced collector emitter current. Tn this arrangement, the emitter of the transistor 48 is connected to the reference terminal and the collector is connected to the output terminal. It is presently preferred, ho ever, that the collector and emitter connections be reversed. A transistor is a bilateral device, in the sense that the emitter and collectors for most transistors may be reversed, without precluding transistor operation.When operated in an inverse mode ti.e., conventional transistor and collector connections reversed , it is base collector current which induces emitter collector current. The transistor is characterized by a lower gain factor, and a correspondingly lower saturation voltage e.g., .1 volt . The reduced saturation voltage attendant with operation of the transistor in the inverse mode is desirable in the present application. Hence it is desirable that the collector and emitter connections be the opposite of that shown in Fig. 3. lsvnen connected in the desired fashion, the maximum negative excursion of the signal at the output terminal 38 is approximately .1 volts or lower. The operation of the circuit is otherwise the same as that described above. The input protection circuit 28 may include more than the single clipper circuit 32. The input protection ci c iit Inlay, for example, also include a second Clipper second clipp r circuit connected in parallel with the clipper circuit 32 shown in Fig. 3 for the purpose of. clipping undesira ly high amplitude positive outputs from the tachometer 30.Fig. 4 illustrates an input protection circuit 50 including an additional diode 56 which functions as a second clipper circuit. The input protection circuit 50 includes a clipper circuit 32 which is substantially the same as the clipper circuit 32 of Fig. 3, but which has the collector and emitter connections of the transistor 48 reversed. The output terminal 38 of the clipper circuit 32 corresponds with the output of the input protection circuit 50, and the input terminal 36 corresponds with the input of the circuit 50. The acted diode 56 has its anode connected to the input terminal 36 and its cathode connected to ground. The diode 56 eliminates that portion of the input signal which is greater than one diode offset approximately .5 volts in magnitude. For voltages below this magnitude, the diode 56 is reverse biased, and therefore has no effect upon the operation of the circuit. For voltages above one diode offset, however, the diode 56 is forward biased whereby it becomes conductive and prevents further increases in the input voltage. Consequently, when the signal source is the tachometer 12, the diode 56 clips the upper portion from each positive tlalF cycle of the tacho rat .er output signal.The signal on the output terminal 381 thus has the form shown in in ig. 2E, since the positive half cycles are truncated by diode 56 and the negative half cycles are clipped off by clipper circuit 32 . In the embodiments described above, the clipping circuit established a minimum signal level. In other words, the circuit clipped off that portion of the input signal which was below the clipping boundary, whereby the clipping boundary was the minimum level that the input signal was permitted to reach. Although the clipping boundary was set at ground potential in the described embodiments, any other clipping boundary can be used by merely connecting the reference terminal to a suitable reference voltage source. For example, if 2 volts is the desired clipping level, reference terminal 40 of Fig. 3 40 of Fig. 4 will be connected to a 2 volt source. Furthermore, the clipping circuit can be changed to establish a maximum rather than a minimum signal level by substituting an NPN transistor for the PNP transistor shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The circuit will then clip off that portion of the input signal which is above the clipping boundary, whereby the clipping boundary is the maximum level that the input signal is permitted to r Ci 0ch . Again,the clipping boundary will corresponded wi h the reference voltage applied to terminal 40 of Fig. 3 401 of Fig. 4 . Although the invention has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment, it will be apreciated that various rearrangements and alterations of parts may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims.
