## Description
The present invention relates to the growth of semiconductors, in particular to the growth of semiconductor materials containing indium and phosphorus. Semiconductor materials containing indium and phosphorus are important, for example, in the fabrication of semiconductor lasers for operation at wavelengths in the infra red, especially near to 1.3 and 1.55 µm, at which wavelengths silica optical fibers usually have loss minima, the minimum at 1.55 µm being the deeper one. Operation near these wavelengths is extremely attractive for telecommunications purposes. Both for telecommunications and other purposes it is often desirable that the laser power should be concentrated into a very narrow frequency range. In the case of telecommunications systems with silica fibres, this is especially important for operation near 1.55 µm where the materials dispersion in the fibre is usually much greater than near 1.3 µm. In one of the simplest semiconductor laser designs the Fabry Perot type , the laser usually operates, undesirably for such purposes, in a plurality of longitudinal modes of differing wavelength. In addition, the precise wavelengths of the modes depend on the dimensions of the laser cavity and this restricts one s freedom to use such lasers in integrated optics structures since in these structures the effective dimensions of the laser cavity are a function of the other devices in the integrated structure . Longitudinal mode control can be achieved by means of a diffraction grating. One laser structure incorporating a diffraction grating is known as distributed feedback DFB laser see G.H.B. Thompson, Semiconductor Lasers, Wiley, 1980 . A DFB laser operating at 1.53 µm has been described by K. Sakai, K. Utaka, S. Akiba, and Y. Matsushima IEEE J. Quantum Electronics, QE 18, No. 8, pages 1272 1278, August 1982 . In constructing their laser they made a first order diffraction grating with a period of 2365 Å 0.2365 µm on the surface of doped InP by holographic techniques and chemical etching. The corrugation depth thus achieved was typically 1000 Å 0.1 µm , but the subsequent growth of a doped quaternary layer i.e. a layer containing Ga, In, As, and P plus dopant reduced the corrugation depth to 200 500 Å 0.02 0.05 µm . They attributed this to dissolution of the grating in the melt used for growing the quaternary layer. This technique of growth is known as liquid phase epitaxy or LPE . The final depth of the DFB corrugations is one of the most important parameters of the device. The reduction of the corrugation depth in LPE has an adverse effect on laser efficiency and in particular raises the threshold current of the laser. High threshold currents make for heating of the laser in use and consequent control difficulties and for low upper working temperatures. In general, one can say that the spectral purity and threshold current of DFB lasers are strongly dependent on the precise positioning and cross section profile of the integral diffraction grating, and that close control of the manufacturing process incorporating these sub micron period corrugations into the laser structure is highly desirable. An object of the present invention is to provide a more satisfactory method of growing semiconductor layers comprising indium and phosphorus on shaped surfaces, especially diffraction gratings. The method of growth to be employed according to the present invention is a modification of the known metal organic chemical vapour deposition MOCVD technique for semiconductor materials comprising indium and phosphorus, as known for example from R. H. Moss and J. S. Evans, J. Crystal Growth, 55, pages 129 134 1981 and from European Patent application published number 52 979. These citations describe the use of certain indium complexes for the provision of indium into MCVD reactions. The said complexes have either general formula I or II The stability of these compounds is such as to avoid substantially premature reactions between R₁R₂R₃ and PH₃ to produce polymers such as In CH₃ PH The present invention provides a method of growing a semiconductor layer comprising indium and phosphorus onto the surface of a semiconductor substrate also comprising indium and phosphorus, in which method the semiconductor material is grown by the metal organic chemical vapour deposition technique from a gas mixture containing phosphine and organometallic compounds for providing indium into the layer, characterised in that the substrate has a shaped surface, e.g. a diffraction grating, and that the exposure of the substrate to phosphine is controlled to avoid or reduce transport of the substrate material by controlling the initiation of the deposition reaction, wherein said initiation comprises The method of the invention is especially suitable for initiating the overgrowth onto the diffraction gratings of DFB lasers intended for operation near to 1.3 µm or 1.55 µm. The stable emission wavelengths and narrow spectral linewidths of these lasers make them of interest in respect of high bit rate, long haul fibre links, wavelength multiplexing, and coherent communications systems. In addition, DFB lasers can be employed in integrated circuits containing both electronic and optoelectronic components since cleaved mirrors are not essential to their operation. However, it is to be understood that lasers of other operating wavelengths could be constructed in accordance with the invention e.g. from 1.1 to 1.65 µm and that other shaped structures could be overgrown by the method of the invention e.g. gratings in Bragg lasers and structures in devices other than lasers . The control of exposure to phosphine in accordance with the invention is based on the principle that phosphine tends to cause material transport and deformation of shaped surfaces at temperatures similar to those required for the growth but that once a surface has been protected by growth such transport and deformation will not occur. Typically one would avoid exposing an unprotected surface to phosphine at temperatures above 550 C for more than one minute and preferably the exposure time would be less than this especially where temperature in excess of 630 C are used for growth. One method of control involves the provision of the gas mixture containing phosphine and the compound of general formula I or II about the substrate at a temperature below that at which material transport would occur and the rapid heating of the substrate in the gas mixture to a suitable growth temperature. This procedure contrasts strongly with the prior art MOCVD technique referred to above, where phosphine is admitted at low temperature and the compound of general formula I or II is admitted only at the growth temperature. Moreover, a procedure in which the compound of general formula I or II is admitted at low temperature might have been expected on the basis of the considerations set out or implied by the prior art to lead to deposition of indium metal and or formation of polymers such as the trimethylindium phosphine polymer In CH₃ PH A second method of control involves the provision of phosphine about the substrate at temperatures below that at which material transport would occur, rapid raising of the substrate to the growth temperature, and admission of the compound of general formula I or II very shortly after the growth temperature is achieved, typically within 20 seconds. We have found that delay leads to very significant alteration of the substrate surface. The man skilled in the art will be able to devise further control procedures based on the principle set out above. It is envisaged that a principal application of the present invention will be to the growth of InP onto a substrate In The reader is referred to the abovementioned prior art on MOCVD for details on the growth itself. It is, however, convenient to note the following points here The present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples and the accompanying Figures 1 to 4 and 8 to 11 of which This Example describes the production of a structure appropriate in its general scheme to a DFB laser operating at 1.55 µm. The 100 face of Sn doped n InP 1 in Figure 1 was used as the substrate for the growth, by conventional two phase LPE at 663 C in a graphite boat, of a three layer quaternary structure, shown bracketed in the figure. The epitaxy was carried out in the automated furnace described in A. W. Nelson, L. D. Westbrook and E. A. D. White, J. Cryst. Growth, volum The first of the three layers grown 2 in Figure 1 comprised a Te doped indium gallium arsenide phosphide layer. This layer was n type with a band gap as determined by photoluminescence equivalent to a wavelength of 1.3 µm. The second layer, 3, comprised an Sn doped indium gallium arsenide phosphide n type with a band gap equivalent of 1.55 µm. The third layer 4, comprised a Zn doped indium gallium arsenide phosphide layer with a band gap equivalent of 1.3 µm. The approximate thicknesses of the layers are, respectively, 0.15 µm, 0.15 µm, and 0.2 µm. Second order DFB corrugations having a period of 0.46 µm were then formed in layer 4 in the 1 With the structure at about 100 C to prevent condensation, the following gases were passed, at slightly above atmospheric pressure, as a mixture into the reaction zone of the MOCVD apparatus 500 cm³ min measured at 20 C of a PH₃ H₂ mixture containing 5 volume per cent of PH₃ i.e. 25 cm³ min PH₃ . 25 cm³ min of H₂ measured at 20 C saturated with C₂H₅ ₃P at 13.5 C. 25 cm³ min of H₂ measured at 20 C saturated with CH₃ ₃In at 50 C. 100 cm³ min measured at 20 C of a mixture of CH₃ ₂Zn and H₂ containing 0.1 volume per cent of CH₃ ₂Zn i.e. 0.1 cm³ min of CH₃ ₂Zn . 4000 cm³ min of additional H₂ measured at 20 C. After 1 to 2 minutes flushing time, the sample was RF heated to 650 C in 40 seconds and held at 650 C for one hour, during which growth of Zn doped p type InP occurred as layer 5. The CH₃ ₃In and C₂H₅ ₃P flows were then stopped and the other flows maintained. The heating was switched off and the sample temperature fell to 450 C in about 1 minute, reaching 50 C after about a further 4 minutes. The PH₃ H₂ and CH₃ ₂Zn H₂ flows were switched off, and finally the H₂ flow shortly before unloading of the structure from the furnace. For safety, unloading was performed under N₂ . This hybrid LPE MOCVD approach to the structure as a whole has the attraction that it combines the present superior quality quaternary material produced by LPE with the near isotropic growth properties of the MOCVD technique, MOCVD InP nucleation being relatively insensitive to the varying surface orientation presented by the DFP grating. It should be noted that tolerances on crystal epitaxy are much more severe for DFB lasers than in Fabry Perot lasers because the lasing wavelength which is controlled by the layer thicknesses and refractive indices together with the grating period needs to be closely matched to the peak gain wavelength for low threshold operation. The electron beam lithography technique used for the production of the gratings has the advantage of being highly flexible. For example, gratings of different periods and of varying orientations may be written on the same wafer in a single exposure under computer control. The mark space ratio of the grating mask may also be varied to produce the optimum amount of any particular Fourier component in the final grating cross section see Westbrook It is believed also that the positioning of the corrugations in the top waveguide layer of quaternary material having a band gap equivalent 1.3 µm is substantially advantageous over positioning them in the InP lowest layer as described for example in Sakai et al already referred to , in T. Matsuoka, H. Nagai, Y. Itaka, Y. Noguchi, Y. Suzuki, and T. Ikegami, Electronics Letters, volume 18, pages 27 28 1982 , and in Y. Uematsu, H. Okuda, and J. Kinoshita, Electronics Letters, 18, 857 858 1982 . The low concentration of P in the quaternary layer compared with InP makes thermal dissociation during the overgrowth process less favourable, and therefore makes for a further reduction of the damage done to the corrugations. Further, it is in practice much easier to obtain precise positioning of the corrugations relative to the active layer so as to maximise DFB coupling. Figures 2 and 3 show that virtually no surface deformation occurred during the MOCVD overgrowth step. The final depth of the corrugations was practically unchanged at approximately 1600 Å 0.16 µm . In this Example, the overgrowth was on a similar substrate to that of Example 1 and the flow rates used were identical. However, the growth temperature was only 575 C achieved in less than 40 seconds and the reagents other than PH₃ and H₂ were introduced only after the growth temperature had been achieved. These other reagents were introduced within 10 seconds of the growth temperature being achieved. It will be seen from Figure 4 that no deformation of the corrugations occurred. However, the growth morphology was inferior to that achieved in Example 1. In this Example, a DFB laser was fabricated and tested. First, a structure as shown in Figure 1 was once more grown. The compositions of materials 1 to 5 in Figure 1 were essentially the same as in Example 1, with the exception that the n type InP substrate 1 was S doped, not Sn doped. The thickness of layers 1 to 4 and the dimensions of the corrugations in layer 4 were also the same. The thickness of the substrate 1 was approximately 200 µm. The thickness of layer 5 was about 3 µm. Layers 2 to 4 were grown by LPE also as described in Eample 1. Layer 5 was grown by MOCVD as in Example 1 except that the flow rate of the CH₃ ₂ Zn H₂ mixture was 3 cm³ min for 50 minutes and 100 cm³ min for the last 10 minutes. This provided a good electrical contact at the top of layer 5 but avoided excessive diffusion of zinc into the active layer 3. The purpose of the choices of compositions and layer thicknesses was to provide in the eventual laser efficient interaction between the stimulated emission and the DFB grating whilst still maintaining effective carrier confinement. Then the base of the InP substrate 1 was metallised with an alloy of gold and tin, and oxide isolated stripe contacts of a gold zinc alloy were formed on the surface of layer 5. These stripes were 15 µm wide and extended in a direction perpendicular to the grooves of the grating. The product was separated into DFB lasers. This was done so that an individual laser was 200 µm long with a longitudinal metal stripe on the top surface, with the side facets i.e. the faces running in the same direction as the stripe scribed, with the one end facet scribed, and with the other end facet cleaved. The purpose of the scribing was to suppress Fabry Perot modes. In the laser, layers 2 and 4 of band gap equivalent 1.3 µm functioned as buffer layers to isolate the active layer 3 of band gap equivalent 1.55 µm from non radiative recombination sites which exist at both the substrate and the DFB corrugation hereto interfaces. A hetero interface in this case is an interface between InP and quaternary material . The laser emits light The relationship of light output to current was determined for one of the DFB lusers at 23 C with the use of 100 ns current pulses at a repetition frequency of 100 Hz. The results are shown in Figure 8. The threshold current at this temperature was observed to be 170 mA. The variation of threshold current, I The plot of Figure 9 may be compared with the empirical relationship It was found that at temperatures between 5 and 25 C the spectral output of the DFB laser was almost entirely contained in a single longitudinal mode near to 1.56 µm. A typical spectrum is shown in Figure 10. A more detailed study showed that the emission linewidth was less than the minimum resolution of our monochromator 0.3 µm . The variation of the peak emission wavelength with temperature is shown in Figure 11. The solid line represents a best fit to the data and corresponds to a temperature coefficient of 0.08 nm C or 0.8 Å C. Experiments were performed on the material transport phenomenon involving In Figures 5, 6, and 7 each of which is an SEM photograph of a corrugated In The experiments were performed by heating the corrugated sample in an atmosphere of 0.6 volume percent PH₃ in H₂ from room temperature to a temperature t in 30 40 seconds, holding temperature t for 60 seconds, and then cooling the sample to 450 C within 60 seconds. The values of t for Figures 5 to 7 were as follows A comparative experiment with pure H₂ at 650 C led to no surface deformation. This experiment indicates the importance of PH₃ for surface deformation. It will be appreciated that simple trial and error experiments along these general lines can be used by the man skilled in the art to guide him in the performance of the invention in any given materials or experimental system. In the case of growth on InP, the results reported by Z. L. Liau and J. N. Walpole, Appl. Phys. Lett., volume 40, pages 568 570 1982 may be of assistance. The experiments may be relevant also to ambient conditions prevalent prior to LPE overgrowth, where the corrugated surface is commonly protected by an InP cover slice which is used to generate an over pressure of phosphorus containing gases in an attempt to prevent thermal dissociation of the substrate. It may be that a significant proportion of the corrugation deformation that occurs during the LPE growth process takes place prior to growth. It may be also that deformation can be utilised to achieve specific effects.
