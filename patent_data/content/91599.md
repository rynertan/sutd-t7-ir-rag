# Semiconductor laser and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser includes an oscillation layer comprising a first clad layer, an active layer and a second clad layer which are comprised of gallium aluminum arse nide and deposited, in this order, on a semiconductor substrate. A cap layer in a stripe geometry for narrowing a width of a current path is deposited on a second clad layer. A buried layer comprised of II VI compound such as zinc selenide, zinc sulfide and the like is formed on the second clad layer other than the portion on which the cap layer is formed, so that the cap layer is buried. The buried layer is formed utilizing a low temperature deposition such as a molecular beam epitaxy.
