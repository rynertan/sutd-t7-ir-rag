# OPTICAL SWITCH

## Abstract
It is disclosed an optical switch for achieving optical switching between a plurality of channel waveguides 12a, 12b constituting a directional coupler, a cross over, bran ches and the like. At least one of said plurality of channel waveguides is a gain guided type waveguide utilizing a gain difference resulting from carrier injection into a semiconduc tor material. Such an optical switch is compact and can be driven at a low voltage.
