# Retarding means for motor vehicles.

## Abstract
A change speed transmission in which gear ratios are established by engagement of appropriate fluid pressure operated friction brakes and clutches CF, CR, B3, B2, B1 includes a manually operable control 41 for partially engaging, to provide retardation of a vehicle, those fric tion brakes and or clutches not in use at any time in establishing a particular gear ratio. The control 41 operates valves 23, 22, 21, 33, 32, 31 which ensure that the rates of power absorption per unit friction area in all partially engaged brakes and or clutches is approxi mately equal and that the degree of retardation so provided decreases with each down shift of the trans mission.
