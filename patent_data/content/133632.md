An electrical switch 10 includes an alternating series of first and second switch cells. Each first cell 64 includes a first conductive member 67 with a first bore 68 and a first insulative member 71 conformally located in the first bore and movable through the first bore. Each second cell 66 includes a second insulative member 72 with a second bore 73 and a second conductive member 74 conformally located in the second bore and movable through the second bore. The first and second bores have substantially the same cross section. The cells are mounted end to end in the alternating series so that the bores align. Severable metallic members 76 electrically interconnect the second conduc tive body of each second cell to the first conductive body of both first cells adjacent to the second cell. The first insulative bodies and the second conductive bodies are simultaneously moved to simultaneously sever the metallic members. A plurality of arcs are thereby produced between the first and second conductive bodies of adjacent cells. Additional arcs may be produced by covering the first bore of the first conductive member and the second conductive member with insulative layers.

## Description
IMPROVED HIGHSPEED, MULTI BREAK ELECTRICAL SWITCH BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to an improved high speed, multibreak electrical switch. More specifically, the present invention constitutes a specific improvement of the switch claimed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent 4,342,978 issued August 3, 1982 in the name of Otto Meister and in a commonly assigned, co filed U.S. Patent Application, Serial Number 179,366 filed August 18, 1980 in the name of Raymond P. O Leary.Brief Discussion of Prior Work The switch claimed in the above noted 366 patent application constitutes an improvement of the switch claimed in priorly filed, commonlyassigned United States Patent Application, Serial No. 972,650, filedDecember 21, 1978 in the name of Otto Meister. The 650 application discloses a high voltage device which includes a fuse and a switch. The fuse is preferably a current limiting fuse having a low continuous current rating which is normally shunted by the switch which has a high continuous current rating.When a fault current or other over current occurs in the circuit to which the device is connected, the switch opens, commutating the current to the currentlimiting fuse for limitation and interruption thereof. In the 650 application, the switch includes a pair of normally engaged contacts which are rapidly movable apart by the ignition of the power cartridge contained within a chamber defined by at least one of the contacts. The contacts move apart in a fixed line of direction forming a gap therebetween upon ignition of the power cartridge to open the switch and to effect current commutation to the currentlimiting fuse. In preferred embodiments of the 650 application, the fuse coaxially surrounds the switch and both are contained in a common housing.This structure minimizes manufacturing costs, renders the overall device convenient to handle and manipulate, and minimizes the inductance of the overall device to ensure rapid commutation of the current from the switch to the fuse. After the invention of the 978 patent was made, the desirability of ensuring the rapid movement apart of the contacts upon ignition of the power cartridge was recognized, as was the fact that the ignition products of the power cartridge could well contaminate the gap which is created between the contacts. Such contamination of the gap may sufficiently lower the voltage of any arc forming in the gap between the contact, which in turn may slow up or prevent rapid commutation of current from the switch to the fuse. In recognition of these problems, the switch of the 978 patent includes a piston mounted on one of the contacts which is movable away from the other contact which may be stationary.This piston defines a portion of the closed chamber which contains the power cartridge and is movable, as its contact moves, through an insulative sleeve against which it seals. The gap between the contacts is, accordingly, electrically insulated and any arc formed between the contacts is constricted between the piston and the sleeve. Moreover, the piston is so related to its contact and the sleeve that it ensures rapid movement of its contact away from the stationary contact and isolates its contact from the ignition products of the power cartridge. In preferred embodiments, the piston and the sleeve are both made of an ablative, arc extinguishing material. Thus, arc extinguishing gas is generated by the piston and the sleeve during arc constriction. The constriction and the gas raise the arc voltage resulting in rapid commutation of the current from the switch to the fuse. The 978 patent also contemplates that the contact mounting the piston is normally electrically connected to a terminal of the device. The terminal is connectable to one side of a circuit being protected, while the stationary contact is connectable to the other side of the circuit. The electrical connection between the movable contact and the terminal is claimed in that application as comprising a variety of sliding contacts. The invention of the co filed, commonly assigned application in the name of O Leary is, in turn, an improvement of the invention of the 978 patent. Specifically, the O Leary application contemplates the formation of a second electrically insulated gap in addition to the electrically insulated gap opened between the contacts. More specifically, the O Leary application contemplates the use of electrical connections between the movable contact and the terminal having certain sliding contact elements and insulative elements. Upon movement of the contact mounting the piston, the sliding contact elements and insulative elements co act so as to form a second insulated gap. The two insulated gaps improve commutation of the current from the switch to the fuse. The inventions of both the 978 patent and O Leary patent application both contemplate normally electrically interconnecting the switch contacts with a shearable or severable diaphragm like member. Upon ignition of the power cartridge and movement apart of the switch contacts, the diaphragm is severed, torn, ripped or otherwise rendered discontinuous, thus breaking the normal electrical interconnection therebetween to open the switch. The use of a shearable diaphragm offers several advantages over sliding contact elements. First, in its normal state, the diaphragm is an integral, continuous member capable of carrying high currents. Sliding contact elements must be able to normally carry current across the interface therebetween when they are stationary and frictionally engaged, and to subsequently freely frictionally slide or move relative to each other.This latter property can result in a compromise in the first property. That is, because the normal frictional engagement between the elements must be such as to permit subsequent free relative movement of the elements, the current carrying ability of the interface may be less than that of a solid or integral conductor. Second, when integral, the diaphragm positively prevents movement of the switch contacts between which it is connected. Sliding contact elements being only normally frictionally engaged cannot as positively prevent movement of the switch contacts they normally electrically interconnect. Third, substantial force is required to sever or tear the diaphragm. This permits the pressure of the ignited power cartridge to build up against the piston until the diaphragm is severed, thus ensuring rapid movement apart of the switch contacts. Sliding contact elements cannot ensure this rapid movement apart due, in great part, to the requirement, discussed above, that the elements be relatively movable. Accordingly, the present invention specifically contemplates using such a shearable diaphragm or similar structure in the switch of theO Leary application to both normally electrically interconnect the switch contacts and to normally electrically interconnect the one contact mounting the piston to the terminal. Both diaphragms are severed or otherwise rendered discontinuous upon ignition of the power cartridge. More generally, the present invention contemplates a switch capable of opening more than the two gaps opened by the switches of the 978 and O Leary applications. Each such gap is opened by severing a diaphragm or similar structure. The present invention also contemplates a building block approach to the construction of electrical switches. More specifically, the present invention recognizes that individual switch cells of two different types having specific characteristics may be altered in a side byside series to produce a switch in which a multiplicity of insulated gaps are simultaneously opened upon ignition of a power cartridge. The fact that multiple insulated gaps are opened by the improved switch of the present invention means that after a very small amount of contact movement, numerous gaps possibly with arcing therein are formed to ensure rapid commutation of the current from the switch to the fuse. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With the above and other objects in view, the present invention relates to an improved high speed, multibreak electrical switch. In a first aspect, the invention relates to a high speed, multi break switch constructed by a building block approach whereby an alternating series of switch cells of two different types are associated to form the switch. In a second aspect, the invention relates to a high speed, multibreak switch in which at least two electrically insulated gaps are formed following the severance of a pair of metallic diaphragm like members. In its first aspect, the switch includes X cells of a first type andY cells of a second type. X and Y may be one or more, but preferably X or Y is greater than one. Each first type of cell includes a first conductive member and a first insulative member. The first conductive member has a first bore between its ends. The first insulative member is conformally located in the first bore and is movable through and out of the first bore. Each second type of cell includes a second insulative member and a second conductive member. The second insulative member has a second bore between its ends. The first and second bores have substantially the same cross section. The second conductive member is conformally located in the second bore and is movable through and out of the second bore.Facilities mount the cells end to end in an alternating series so that the bores align and form a continuous passage. All cells but the cells at the termini of the series have cells of other type adjacent both ends thereof. Conductors, which are preferably severable metallic members such as shearable diaphragms, normally electrically interconnect the conductive members of adjacent cells. A force applying facility, preferably an ignitable power cartridge, simultaneously moves the first insulative members and the second conductive members in a given direction and renders discontinuous by severing the conductors. Each first insulative member moves out of its first bore and conformally into the second bore of an adjacent cell. Each second conductive member moves out of its second bore and conformally into the first bore of an adjacent cell.The severance of the conductors opens a first gap between each second conductive member and the first conductive member of any adjacent cell opposite to the given direction. The first gaps are insulated by the conformality of the first and second insulated members. In its first aspect, the switch may also include facilities for forming second insulated gaps between the second conductive members and adjacent cells in the given direction. Preferably, these facilities include either an electrically insulative layer lining in the first bores, an electrically insulative layer on the second conductive members, or both. In specific preferred embodiments, the insulative members and layers include an ablative, arcextinguishing material. In its second aspect, the switch includes a pair of contacts movable apart along a fixed line of direction. A first shearable or breakable metallic member or diaphragm normally electrically interconnects the contacts. Parting movement of the contacts shears or breaks the first diaphragm to open a first gap between the contacts so a first facility electrically insulates the first gap as the contacts move apart. A second shearable or breakable metallic member or diaphragm normally electrically interconnects one of the contacts to a terminal or third contact when the contact pair is electrically interconnected. Parting movement of the contact pair shears or breaks the second diaphragm to open a second gap between the one contact and the terminal A second facility insulates the second gap as the contact pair moves apart. A chamber is defined by the first facility.Pressurization of the chamber moves the contact pair apart. An ignitable device is in the chamber.Ignition of the device pressurizes the chamber. In preferred embodiments of the switch in its second aspect, the one contact moves away from the other contact and toward the terminal as the contact pair moves apart. The first facility comprises a first insulative member carried by the one contact and an insulative sleeve through which the first insulative member and the contact move. The first insulative member is interposed between the contact pair as it moves apart. The second facility comprises a second and a third insulative member respectively on the one contact and the terminal, both of which are interposed between the one contact and the terminal as the contact pair moves apart. The second and third insulative members telescope as the contacts move apart. In specific embodiments of the switch unit s second aspect, the insulative members include an ablative, arc extinguishing material. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURE 1 is a side elevational, partially sectioned view of a device incorporating an improved high speed switch in accordance with the principles of the present invention, the device also including a fuse to produce a high voltage device, both of the latter being only generally depicted FIGURE 2 is a side elevational, sectioned view of an alternative embodiment of the switch of FIGURE 1 generally illustrating a building block approach to the construction of improved switches according to the present invention and FIGURE 3 is a specific embodiment of the switch depicted inFIGURE 2 which may be used in the device of FIGURE 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring first to FIGURE 1, there is shown a high speed switch 10 in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The switch 10 may be used as a component of a high voltage device, generally indicated at 12, which includes both the switch 10 and a parallel electrical path shown only schematically at 14. The path 14 may include a fuse or a fusible element 16, although other components are contemplated. The normally closed switch 10 has a high continuous current carrying capability and shunts the path 14. The fuse 16 is preferably a current limiting fuse, although noncurrent limiting fuses are contemplated. Normally when the switch 10 is closed, little current passes through the path 14 or the fuse 16. As is well known, current limiting fuses 16 have a low continu j s current carrying capability. The closed switch 10 eliminates the fuse 1 G having to carry a substantial amount of current.When the switch 10 opens, current is commutated to the path 14 and to the fuse 16 for interruption thereof, Ac msre fully explained in the 650 patent application 978 patent. The device 12 may include an outer insulative housing, generally designated 18, containing both the switch 10 and the path 14. An inner insulative housing 22 contains the various elements of the switch 10. In the event that the device 12 is intended to operate as a current limiting or energylimiting fuse, a volume 20 defined between the housings 18 and 22 may be filled with a fulgurite forming arcquenching medium, such as silica or quartz sand not shown to aid in the current limiting action of the fuse 16. The housing 22 isolates the elements of the switch 10 from the medium. The general operation and construction of the device 12 is more specifically described in the abovenoted, commonly assigned United States patent and patent application. The switch 10 includes a first tubular member 24 fixed at one end to the housing 22. The conductive member 24 may protrude beyond the end of the outer housing 18 and may serve as a mount and a connection for the device 12 to one side of a high voltage circuit not shown which the device 12 is intended to protect. The conductive member 24 defines both an interior bore 26 and a portion of an enclosed chamber 28 contiguous therewith. The bore 26 preferably, but not necessarily, has a circular cross section. Normally located in the chamber 28 is a power cartridge 30 or the like which is selectively ignitable to pressurize the chamber 28. Ignition of the power cartridge 30 results in the generation of solid and gaseous ignition products, some of which are conductive.The power cartridge 30 may be selectively ignited by applying to input conductors thereof not shown an appropriate signal in response to the occurrence of a fault current or other over current in the circuit to which the device 12 is connected. For further details of the power cartridge 30, reference should be made to the earlier noted, commonly assigned United States patent and patent application. Normally conformally located within the bore 26 is an electrically insulative piston like member 32, which may be similar to the trailer of a socalled trailer liner interrupter. Preferably, the piston 32 is made of an ablative, arc extingushing material which evolves arc extinguishing gas in response to the heat of an electrical arc. Preferably, the member 32 fills or nearly fills the bore 26 so that one end thereof is normally adjacent, and aids in defining, the chamber 28. In the orientation depicted in FIGURE 1, ignition of the power cartridge 30 pressurizes the chamber 28 and conformally moves the member 32 rightwardly in the bore 26. To the right of the member 24, the central portion of the housing 22 defines a bore 34. In preferred embodiments, the insulative housing 22 is made of glass reinforced epoxy and the bore 34 is lined with an electrically insulative sleeve or layer 36, preferably made of an ablative, arcextingushing material. The sleeve 36 defines an interior bore 38. Normally conformally located in the bore 38 is a conductive rod 40, the outer surface of which carries an insulative sleeve or layer 42. The rod 40 with the sleeve 42 thereon is conformally movable through and out of the bore 38. The bore 38 is substantially the same cross section as and is aligned with the bore 26. Thus, the member 32 is both conformally movable through and out of the bore 26 and conformally movable into the bore 38. The right end of the insulative housing 22 mounts a second tubular conductive member 44 which may be similar to the first member 24. A portion of the member 44 may protrude beyond the housing 18 for mounting the device 12 and for connecting it to the other side of the circuit protected by the device 12. The second conductive member 44 defines an interior bore 46 aligned and contiguous with the bore 38 which is lined with an insulative sleeve 48, itself defining an interior bore 50. The bore 50 preferably has a circular crosssection and, although it need not have the same diameter cross section as the bores 38 and 26, is of a shape to permit conformal movement thereinto of the rod 40 with the insulative sleeve 42 thereon. If desired, the bores 26, 38 and 50 may all have the same cross section. Normally electrically interconnecting the first conductive member 24 and the rod 40 is a metallic member 52. The metallic member may take the form of a shearable, severable, tearable or breakable diaphragm or annular member having a general cupshape, the lip of the cup being normally connected as by brazing, welding or the like to a first member 24 and the bowl of the cup being connected to the rod 40 by a connector 54, such as a rivet, stud or the like. The member 52 may take other forms such as one or more wires or conductive strips, a metal disc or a body of solder or the like.Rightward movement of the piston like member 32 due to ignition of the power cartridge 30 causes the right edge of the piston 32 to bear against one side of the metallic member 52 while at the same time the left edge ofthe sleeve 36 bears against the metallic member 52 from the other side. Ultimately, the metallic member is sheared and the electrical interconnection between the first member 24 and the rod 40 is broken. To aid in this shearing action, the metallic member 52 may contain a weakened or prescored portion, as more fully described in the above noted 978 patent. The connector 54 both attaches the metallic member 52 to the rod 40 and connects the piston 32 and the rod 40 to ensure conjoint movement thereof. Normally electrically interconnecting the rod 40 and the second conductive member 44 is a metallic member 56 which may be the same as or similar to the metallic member 52. Upon rightward movement of the rod 40, the metallic member 56 is sheared by the action of the right edge of the insulative sleeve 42 and the left edge of the sleeve 48. Similar to the metallic member 52, the metallic member 56 may generally comprise a cup shaped diaphragm or annulus, the lip or rim of which is connected as by welding, brazing or the like to the second member 44 and the bowl of which is attached by a connector 58 directly to the rod 40. As pointed out more fully in the above noted 978 patent, metallic members such as those shown at 52 and 56 may be adjacent a cutting edge or member not shown instead of or in addition to pre weakening thereof to ensure that they are severed, as described above.The metallic member 56 may, of course, comprise functionally similar members such as wires, metal strips, metal discs, a body of solder or the like. Assuming that both members 24 and 44 are connected to an electrical circuit, and whether or not the path 14 is used in conjunction with the switch 10, the elements of this switch 10 normally assume the position depicted in FIGURE 1. A normal current path through the switch 10 therefore includes, in order, the first member 24, the metallic member 52, the rod 40, the metallic member 56, and the second member 44. Should it be desired to open the switch 10, for example, because of the occurrence of a fault current or other ovexcurrent in the circuit to which the switch 10 is connected, the power cartridge 30 is ignited to pressurize the chamber 28. This moves both the piston 32 and the rod 40 with the insulative sleeve 42 thereon rightwardly. Rightward movement of the piston 32 severs the metallic member 52, and rightward movement of the rod 40 severs the metallic member 56, as described above. Further, the piston 32 conformally moves through and out of the bore 26 and conformally into the bore 38 while the rod 40 with the insulative sleeve 42 thereon moves through and out of the bore 38 and conformally into the bore 50. The rightward movement of the rod 40 and the severance of the metallic members 52 and 56 opens the switch 10 at two locations and opens two gaps therein. The first gap is opened between the right end of the member 24 and the left end of the rod 40, which together may be viewed as a first contact pair 24,40. The second gap is opened between the right end of the rod 40 and the left end of the member 44 acting as a second contact pair 40,44. The first gap is electrically insulated by the conformal reception of the piston 32 in the sleeve 36. The second gap is electrically insulated by the conformal reception of the sleeve 42 in the sleeve 48. If the circuit to which the switch 10 is connected is, as contemplated, at a sufficiently high voltage, arcing may occur in the two gaps.Specifically, arcing may occur in the first gap between the member 24 probably at or in the vicinity of the lip of the metallic member 52 connected to the member 24 and the rod probably at or in the vicinity of the bowl of the member 52 carried by the rod 40. Because the piston 32 has conformally entered the bore 38, the first arc between the member 24 and the rod 40 is constricted between the piston 32 and the sleeve 36. This constriction is accompanied by the evolution of arc extinguishing gas should the piston 32 or the sleeve 36 include an ablative arc extinguishing material. Both the constriction and the arc extinguishing gas tend to raise the voltage of or extinguish the arc, either or both of which effect current commutation to the path 14.Moreover, the conformal reception of the piston 32 in the bores 26 and 38 prevents or hinders the conductive ignition products of the power cartridge 30 from reaching the right end of the member 24 or the left end of the rod 40, thus eliminating substances which could encourage the arc to persist or lower its voltage. Arcing may also occur in the second gap. Specifically, such arcing may occur between the left end of the member 44 or the lip of the metallic member 56 remaining thereon and the right end of the rod 40 or the bowl of the member 56 carried thereby. This second arc is constricted between the insulative sleeves 42 and 48 because of conformal reception of the rod 40 and the sleeve 42 thereon in the bore 50. Thus, the second arc is constricted and subjected to the action of arc extinguishing gas if the sleeves 42 and 48 are made of an ablative, arc extinguishing material. Further, the second gap has excluded therefrom any ignition products of the power cartridge 30 which manage to infiltrate into and beyond the first gap. In the switch 10 of FIGURE 1, the members 24 and 44 are similar and, indeed, may be used interchangeably at either end thereof. Because the member 44 is lined with the sleeve 48, the diameter of the bore 46 is slightly less than the diameter of the bore 26. Thus, the diameters of the. members 52 and 56 are slightly different as depicted in FIGURE 1. This difference in the diameters of the bores 26 and 50 leads to the diameter of the rod 40 with the insulative sleeve 42 thereon being slightly smaller than the diameter of the bore 38 in order to facilitate movement of the rod 40 with the sleeve 42 thereon conformally into the bore 50. As noted previously, the diameter of the bore 38 must be sufficiently large to accommodate conformal movement thereinto of the piston 32.If similarity of the members 24 and 44 is not a primary concern, the diameters of the bores 26, 38 and 50 may all be the same, which requires that the bore 46 of the member 44 be initially somewhat larger than the diameter of the bore 26. In this event, the diameters of the piston 32 and the rod 40 with the sleeve 42 thereon are the same. It should be noted that, unlike the switches of the 650 patent application and 978 patent, the present switch 10 opens two electrically insulated gaps. As previously discussed, the switch of the 650 patent application opens a single electrically uninsulated gap, while the switch of the 978 patent opens a single electrically insulated gap. Further, the present invention contemplates normally electrically interconnecting each of two contact pairs 24,40 and 40,44 with the metallic members 52 and 56 in contrast to the switch of the O Leary application which utilizes one such member at one contact pair, but sliding contact elements at the other contact pair. Turning now to FIGURE 2, there is shown an alternative version of the switch 10 constructed along a building block approach which can rapidly produce practically any desired number of electrically insulated gaps to rapidly open a high voltage current path. The alternative switch 10 of FIGURE 2 includes two types of switch cells 64 and 66. A specific form of the first type of switch cell 64 comprises a first tubular conductive member 67 defining a bore 68 therethrough between the ends thereof. The bore 68 contains or is lined with an insulative layer or sleeve 69 defining a bore 70. Normally conformally positioned within the bore 70 is an insulative member 71 which is conformally movable through and out of the bore 70. In a more general form, the layer 69 is not used, and the first type of switch cell 64 may include only the conductive member 67 with the bore 68 and the insulative member 71 in and conformally movable through and out of the bore 68. Differences in operation between the specific and general first type of cell 64 are explained below.Whichever first cell 64 is used, the bore 70 68 in the general form and the insulative member 71 preferably have circular cross sections, but other cross sections are contemplated.Moreover, the inside diameter of the bore 70 or of the bore 68 if the layer 69 is not used while preferably substantially equal to the outside diameter of the insulative member 71, may be slightly larger than the diameter of the member 71. Preferably, the member 71 and the layer 69 where used comprise or contain an ablative, arc extinguishing material, such a Nylon, Delrin, polyethylene, melamine, polytetrafluoroethylene, horn fiber or the like. A specific form of the second type of switch cell 66 comprises a tubular insulative member 72 defining a bore 73 therethrough between the ends thereof. Conformally contained within the bore 73 and conformally movable through and out of the bore 73 is a conductive member 72 covered with an insulative layer or sleeve 75. In a more general form, the layer 75 is not used, and the second type of switch cell 66 may include only the insulative member 72 with the bore 73 and the conductive member 74 conformally located therein and conformally movable therethrough. Whichever second cell 66 is used, the bore 73 and the conductive member 74 with the layer 75 thereon or the member 74 alone if the layer 75 is not present preferably have circular crosssections, other cross sections being contemplated.Also, the inside diameter of the bore 73, while preferably substantially equal to the outside diameter of the layer 75 or of the member 74, if the layer 75 is not used may be slightly larger than this diameter. Preferably, the member 72 and the layer 75 where used comprise or contain an ablative arcextinguishing material. In a specific form of the switch 10, an alternating series .64,66,64,66,64,66 . . . etc of the first and second cells 64 and 66 is formed.Specifically, a housing 22 , which may be similar to the housing 22 shown inFIGURE 1, maintains each cell 64,66 in an end to end relationship to its adjacent cell or cells 66 or 64 so that the bores 70 and 73 are aligned. The bores 70 and 73 have cross sections of the same size and configuration.Accordingly, the bores 70 and 73 of the alternating, end to end series of cells 64 and 66 form a continuous passage... 70,73,70,73,70,73 etc. Also, each insulative member 71 is conformally movable into the bore 73 of an adjacent second cell 66, while each conductive member 74 with its layer 75 is conformally movable into the bore 70 of an adjacent first cell 64. Each cell 64 and 66 is adjacent at both of its ends to a cell 66 and 64 of the opposite type, except those cells at the termini of the series. In FIGURE 2, these terminal cells are shown as one cell 64 at the left of the first type and one cell 66 at the right of the second type. It should be clear that the series may also terminate with a first cell 64 at both ends, with a second cell 66 at both ends, or with a second cell 66 at the left and a first cell 64 at the right.Preferably, the number X of first cells 64 or the number Y of second cells 66 is greater than 1. As a consequence, preferred specific forms of the switch 10 shown inFIGURE 2 include the following series of cells 64 and 66 64,66,64 66,64,66 64,66,64,66 66,64,66,64 64,66,64,66,64 etc. The series will always include either the same number of first and second cells 64 and 66 if the series has an even number of cells , or one more of one type than the other if the series has an odd number of cells . Metallic members 76 normally electrically interconnect the conductive members 67 and 74 of adjacent cells 64 and 66. This means that the conductive member 67 of all but terminal first cells 64 are normally electrically interconnected to the conductive member 74 of both adjacent second cells 66, and that the conductive member 74 of all but terminal second cells 66 are normally electrically interconnected to the conductive member 67 of both adjacent first cells 64. The conductive members 67 and 74 of terminal cells are electrically interconnected to the conductive members 74 and 67 of the only cell of the opposite type 66 and 64 which is adjacent thereto. The metallic members 76 are the same as or similar to the severable or shearable metallic members or diaphragms 52 and 56 shown in FIGURE 1. Application of a force to either end of the switch 10 conjointly moves the insulative member 71 of each cell 64 and the conductive member 74 with the layer 75 of each cell 66 in the direction of application. To this end, adjacent members 71 and 74 and the member 76 therebetween may be held together by connectors which are not shown in FIGURE 2, but may be similar to the connectors 54 and 58 of FIGURE 1. In FIGURE 2, if the force is applied rightwardly to the insulative member 71 of the left hand terminal cell 64, all of the members 71 and 74 move rightwardly. Further, each member 71 and 74 except that of the right hand adjacent cell 66 moves conformally out of its respective bore 70 or 73 and conformally into the bore 73 or 70 of its righthand adjacent cell 66 or 64.The member 74 of the right hand terminal cell 66 merely moves out of its bore 73. A similar, but mirror image, result is achieved if a leftwardly directed force is applied to the member 74 of the right hand terminal cell 66, except that the member 71 of the left hand terminal cell 64 merely moves out of its bore 70. The force applying means is preferably similar to the power cartridge 30 described above with reference toFIGURE 1, as more fully explained below with reference to FIGURE 3. For purposes of describing the specific form of switch shown inFIGURE 2, it is assumed that conductive member 67 of the left hand terminal cell 64 and the conductive member 74 of the right hand terminal cell 66 are continuously, electrically connected to an energized electrical circuit.Further, the members 67 and 74 may also be electrically connected to a parallel path, similar to the path 14 of FIGURE 1. Assuming the application of the rightwardly directed force, in a general sense, the switch 10 of FIGURE 2 operates much like the switch 10 ofFIGURE 1 in that movement of the insulative member 71 of the left hand terminal cell 64 moves all other insulative members 71 and all other conductive members rightwardly. This movement simultaneously severs all of the metallic members 76 producing an insulated gap at the point of severance of each such member 76. Specifically, as each metallic member 76 is rendered discontinuous, as described with reference to FIGURE 1, the conductive members 74 conformally move into the bore 70 of the rightwardly adjacent first cell 64.This movement opens a first gap between the left end of each member 74 and the right end of the leftwardly adjacent member 67. Each first gap is insulated by the conformal engagement between the leftwardly adjacent insulative member 71 and the bore 73 of the insulative member 72 being vacated by the moving member 74. A second gap is also opened between the right end of each member 74 and the left end of the rightwardly adjacent member 67. Each second gap is insulated by the conformal engagement of the layer 75 on each member 74 and the bore 73 of the rightwardly adjacent insulative member 72 into which the member 74 is moving. The insulation of the gaps by the member 71 and the layers 69 and 75 achieves the same ends as achieved by the piston 32 and the sleeves 36, 42 and 48 of FIGURE 1 relative to arc constriction and extinguishment and to isolation of the gaps from the ignition products of the power cartridge 30. The voltages of any arcs forming in the gaps are additive in effect. Thus, the effect of quickly opening multiple gaps with multiple arcs therein is the equivalent of opening a single long gap zith a single long are therein. However, the multiple gaps are opened simultaneously in a much shorter time than the long gap can be opened because of the short distance through which the members 71 and 74 are moved.Thus, the switch of FIGURE 2 is quite fastacting and may achieve rapid, positive commutation of current to a parallel path. If desired, a stop or brake not shown may be used to limit the movement of the members 71 and 74. Specifically, it may be desirable to stop the train of members 71 and 74 when each member 71 and 74 has moved part way through the adjacent bore 73 and 68. The switch 10 may also include an alternating series of the more general forms which may be taken by the cells 64 and 66, as discussed earlier.If both types of more general cells 64 and 66 are used, only the first insulated gap is formed. Specifically, neither layer 67 or 75 is present. Thus, the insulative members 71 normally conformally reside in the bores 68 and the conductive members 74 are in direct conformal engagement with the bores 73.The bores 68 and 73 have, in this event, similar cross sections and are aligned, for example, by the housing 22 . Rightward movement of the train of members 71 and 74, as described above, severs the metallic members 76, but insulated gaps are formed by the conformal engagement between the members 71 and 72 only between the left end of each member 74 and the right end of the leftwardly adjacent member 67. No gap is formed between the right end of the member 74 and the left end of the rightwardly adjacent member 67, between which there will be sliding contact or only a small separation.As should be obvious, alternate metallic members 76 those shown in FIGURE 2 as interconnecting the right end of the members 74 to the left end of the rightwardly adjacent members 67 may be omitted or some other form of normal interconnection, such as a small overlap, may be substituted. If the specific cells 64 or 66 of either type are used, second insulated gaps will be formed. Specifically, if the more general first type of cell 64 is used with the more specific second type of cell 66, second insulated gaps are formed by the conformal engagement between the layer 75 and the bore 68 of the rightwardly adjacent member 67 into which each member 74 moves. In this event, the bores 68 and 73 have similar cross sections. If the specific first cells 64 are used with the more general second cells 66, second insulated gaps are formed by the conformal engagement between the members 74 without the layers 75 and the bore 70 of the righwardly adjacent layers 69.In this event, the bores 70 and 73 have similar cross sections. General and specific types of cells 64 and 66 may be combined and permitted to open second gaps at preselected locations of the switch 10. Turning now to FIGURE 3, there is shown a specific embodiment of the switch 10 in accordance with the building block approach generally illustrated in FIGURE 2. FIGURE 3 illustrates, specifically, a way in which to move the train of members 71 and 74 and in which the members 67 or 74 may be continuously connected to a circuit. As can be seen in FIGURE 3, the switch 10 includes two cells of the second type 66 between which is a single cell of the first type 64. Unlike the generalized switch in FIGURE 2, the switch 10 of FIGURE 3 terminates at either end with structure that deviates somewhat from the specific form of the first and second cells 64 and 66. Specifically, the cell at the right of the switch 10 in FIGURE 3 which is like that shown at the right of FIGURE 1 and bears the same reference numerals is similar to the first type of cell 64, except that it normally contains no insulative member 71 therein. This permits the leftwardly adjacent conductive member 74 with the layer 75 thereon to move into the bore 50 of the sleeve 48.Similarly, the cell at the left of the switch 10 in FIGURE 3 contains only the piston 32 which is similar to the member 71 within the bore 26 of the tubular conductive member 24 which is similar to the member 6 like the structure depicted at the left in FIGURE 1. This structure is representative of the first type of cell 64 in its general form, that is, the insulative layer 69 is not present. Thus, the switch 10 of FIGURE 3 includes one first cell 64 in its general form and one first cell 64 in its specific form alternated with two second cells 66 in the specific form. By the same token, then, the switches of FIGURE 1 may be said to constitute a first cell 64 in its general form the members 24 and 32 and a second cell 66 in its specific form the members 36, 40 and 42 . Similar to the structure shown in FIGURE 1, the member 24 houses the power cartridge 30 in the enclosed chamber 28. Ignition of the power cartridge 30 exerts a rightwardly directed force on the piston 32.Rightward movement of the piston 32 moves the train of members 71 and 74 to the right. Any number of first and second cells 64 and 66 may be alternated and the ends of the switch 10 may take any convenient configuration. Since the switch 10 of FIGURE 3 contains four metallic members 76 and since the specific forms of the cells 64 and 66 are utilized, four gaps are opened during the operation thereof. The opening of four gaps creates a high arc voltage between the conductive members 24 and 44 which will effect the rapid commutation of current in the switch 10 to the fuse 14 if such is used with very little movement of the members 71 and 74.
