# Steric stabilisation of PVC particles against agglomeration.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of steric stabili sation of polyvinyl chloride PVC particles against agglomera tion by use of additives during polymerisation of vinyl chloride. The method is characterised by the use of a hydroxy alkyl acrylate comonomer added to the reactants prior to the onset of polymerisation. The process of the present invention can be carried out to produce PVC either by bulk or by suspension polymerisation techniques. The comonomer used may be considered as an adduct of hydroxypropyl meth acrylate and propylene oxide. The PVC products so produced have a better monomer desorption rate and can absorb more plasticizer than those produced in the absence of the comonomer.
