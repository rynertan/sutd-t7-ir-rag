# Continuous treatment process for polymer compositions.

## Abstract
A continuous treating process for a rubber modified styrenic polymer composition produced by bulk or solution polymerization and containing at least 1 by weight of a rubber component and at least 16 by weight of the total amount of an unreacted monomer and solvent is provided. The polymer composition is treated in a two stage volatile component separation apparatus each stage comprising a multi tube preheater 4, 14 and a volatilizer 5, 15 to remove the unreacted monomer and other volatile components via lines 20, 25 in the first stage volatilizer 4, 5 the composi tion treated therein contains 3 15 by weight of the unreacted monomer and solvent, and in the second stage volatilizer 14, 15 voltaile components are further stripped from the composition reducing their contents to negligible levels.
