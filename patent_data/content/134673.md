## Description
Improved plasmid vector and use thereof This invention relates to Escherichia coli plasmid vectors improved in that they are suited for the production of useful polypeptides and to the use thereof. More particularly, it relates to improved plasmid vectors having a 5 terminal untranslated region of the Eschrichia coli lipoprotein gene, which region is improved in that a gene coding for a useful polypeptide can be inserted in an easy and simple manner and that said useful polypeptide can be produced in substantially complete form, and to the production of useful polypeptides using Escherichia coli transformants transformed with said plasmids. The so called recombinant DNA technology hereinafter abbreviated as rDNA technology has so far made it possible to produce a variety of useful polypeptides by the use of microbial cells or higher animal cells and, accordingly, it may be said that general techniques thereof have already been established. However, with respect to the technology and method of economical production of each individual polypeptide, there still remains room for improvement. In producing a certain useful polypeptide by utilizing rDNA technology, various factors exert influences on the productivity. It is known that, among the factors the promoter involved in the promotion of transcription of an exogeneous gene coding for the useful polypeptide as inserted and the so called Shine Dalgarno sequence SD sequence involved in complementary binding of mRNA to the 3 terminal sequence of 16S ribosome RNA have a great influence on the production of said useful peptide.However, there is no rule established between the promoter region or SD sequence and the productivity of each individual polypeptide. Thus, for instance, the fact that a certain promoter or SD sequence causes high expression of a certain heterologous gene does not always mean that it also allows high expression of another heterologous gene. Whereas the presence of a 3 terminal untranslated region of said gene is also a factor bringing about high expression of an exogeneous gene and is important especially for the expression of a heterologous gene in eukaryotic cells, mention thereof is not made herein because the invention has no direct relation thereto.It is also known that some host cells are suited for the expression of an objective gene but others are not suited. No further mention is made in that respect, either. For the expression of an inserted heterologous gene, various promoters are used depending on the host cells. When the host is Escherichia coli, for instance, use is made of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthesis gene promoter, ss galactosidase gene promoter, B lactamase gene promoter, alkaline phosphatase gene promoter and lipoprotein promoter and the lambda A phage PL promoter, among others. Roughly speaking, heterologous polypeptides are produced by two methods.In the first method, an objective peptide is produced as a hybrid protein with a certain protein while, in the second method, the objective polypeptide is produced directly, with a methionine residue added to the N terminus in some cases. Thus, for instance, a hybrid protein from an objective peptide and a certain protein connected with each other through methionine is produced and then treated with cyanogen bromide CNBr for cleaving the methionine residue, and the resulting objective peptide is isolated. In that case, use of the ss galactosidase gene promoter for producing an objective peptide as a hygrid protein with alkaline phosphatase protein is favorable in respect of productivity of the objective peptide and purification thereof Japanese Patent Application No. 107,474 1982 .For producing polypeptides, such as interferons, by direct expression, there are used, for example, the tryptophan gene promoter, ss galactosidase gene promoter and A phage PL promoter cf., for example, P.W. Gray et al., Nature, 295 503, 1982 D. Goeddel et al., Nature, 287 411, 1980 T. Taniguchi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci., 77 5230, 1980 R. Derynck et al., Nature, 287 193, 1980 . On the other hand, one of the factors required for efficient production of a heterologous polypeptide inEscherichia coli is the SD sequence which is upstream from the translation initiation codon ATG . The complementarity of this SD sequence and the 3 terminal sequence of 16S ribosome RNA, the distance between theSD sequence and translation start codon, and the secondary structure of mRNA, at and around the translation startpoint, among others, are supposed to contribute to efficient initiation of translation. It is therefore presumable that the productivity of the polypeptide to be produced depends on the amino acid sequence of that portion of said peptide which is close to the N terminus, or, in other words, the DNA sequence corresponding to said portion. Paying their attention to the above points, the present inventors modified the nucleotide sequence of the 5 terminal untranslated region of the Escherichia coli lipoprotein gene in various ways and thereby constructed Escherichia coli plasmids into which exogeneous genes can be inserted for very efficient expression thereof and which allow efficient production of objective polypeptides in substantially complete form, and have now completed the present invention.Furthermore, the use of the plasmid vectors according to the invention led to efficient production of a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of human immune interferon hereinafter abbreviated as hINF y , whereby culture compositions containing said polypeptide in high concentrations could be obtained. Thus, the present invention provides Escherichia coli plasmid vectors characterized in that they have a 5 terminal untranslated region inclusive of the promoter region and Shine Dalgarno sequence of theEscherichia coli lipoprotein gene, which region is improved to thereby enable direct production of useful polypeptides in substantially complete form. The Escherichia coli lipoprotein is a protein which constitutes the outermembrane of Escherichia coli, the content being 4.8 x 105 molecules per cell Bacterial Outermembrane, Biogenesis and Functions, edited by Masayori Inouye, page 8, Wiley Interscience Publication, Toronto, 1979 . It is also known that the corresponding lipoprotein gene has a promoter potent in transcription activity. The gene covering the lipoprotein promoter region 5 terminal untranslated region to the structural gene for said protein has already been cloned in pBR322 and a series of plasmids modified to thereby enable expression of exogeneous genes inserted therein have been constructed cf. Kagaku to Seibutsu, 20, No. 1, 47 58, 1982 . A patent specification laid open discloses heterologous polypeptide production using the above promoter region Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho No. 140,800 1982 . However, the cloning vector disclosed in the above has serious drawbacks, such as mentioned below. The cloning site site for insertion of exogeneous polypeptide encoding genes in said vector, the EcoRI cleavage site of said vector is 10 11 bases downstream from the translation startpoint and therefore the desired product polypeptides have, on the N terminus side thereof, an extra peptide added thereto. This offers a problem of antigenicity upon administration to the human body, even if the product polypeptides are physiologically active. Such polypeptides are never preferred since they have a structure different from the original one. In accordance with the invention, novel high expression vectors free of the drawbacks that the above known vector has are constructed through modification of the SD sequence of the lipoprotein gene, modification of the distance between the SD sequence and translation startpoint and insertion of the cloning site at a new site, among others. Typical examples have proved their utility. Hereinbelow, the plasmid vectors according to the invention and use thereof are described in more detail. The base sequence including the Escherichia coli lipoprotein promoter region and part upstream portion of the structural gene for said protein on pINIA2, which is one of the plasmids reconstructed to thereby enable expression of exogeneous genes, is shown in Fig.1. This plasmid has drawbacks such as mentioned above, since the cloning site EcoRI in Fig. 1 for insertion of exogeneous genes to be expressed is in the lipoprotein structural gene in the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide . The base sequence from the promoter region to an upstream portion of the structural gene to the EcoRI cleavage site as shown in Fig. 1 is identical with that of one of the expression vectors disclosed in the above citedJapanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho No. 140,800 1982. Accordingly, for avoiding extra peptide addition to the N terminus of desired heterologous polypeptides, the present inventors replaced the XbaI EcoRI fragment shown in Fig. 1 with a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide fragment having XbaI and EcoRI cohesive ends at the respective ends and containing theSD sequence , followed by connection of the gene coding for a desired useful polypeptide for example, polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of hIFN y downstream from said EcoRI site. The thus constructed plasmid pIN4GIF54 was used for transformation ofEscherichia coli. The transformant W3110 pIN4GIF54 , under the control of the lipoprotein gene promoter, could produce hIFN y without any extra peptide added to the N terminus thereof. In the above explanation, hIFN y has been given as an example of the heterologous useful polypeptide for better understanding. It is obvious that the above principle can also be applied to the production of other polypeptides. Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the construction of pIN4GIF54. In the figure, pGIF54 is essentially the same plasmid as pGIF4 disclosed in Japanese PatentApplication No. 86,180 1982. An Escherichia coli transformant, WA802 pGIF4, obtained by transformation with said plasmid containing the chemically synthesized gene coding for the amino acid sequence of hIFN y as shown in Fig. 6 has been named SBMG105 and deposited with the Fermentation Research Institute, the Agency ofIndustrial Science and Technology Deposit No. FERMP 6522 International Deposit No. under the BudapestTreaty FERM BP 2823. The plasmid pINI A2 is a gift from Mr. Inoue of New York State University. A hostEscherichia coli strain obtained by transformation with said plasmid has been named JA221 PINIA2 and deposited with the Fermentation Research Institute under DepositNo. FERM BP 320. Fig. 3 illustrates the nucleotide sequence from the 5 terminal untranslated region of the lipoprotein gene as modified according to the invention to an upstream portion of the hIFN y gene inserted. The SD sequence shown in Fig. 3 is the same as that of the lipoprotein gene and the distance between the SD sequence and the translation initiation codon remains unaltered. While the strain of Escherichia coli transformed with pIN4GIF54 constructed in the manner shown in Fig.2, W3110 pIN4GIF54, also produced hINF y as described later in detail , the inventors attempted further modification of the SD sequence for increasing the productivity cf. Fig. 4 . Thus, they designed the SD sequence oligonucleotide so as to made it complementary to the 3 end sequence of Escherichia coli 16S ribosomeRNA, and chemically synthesized the DNA fragment shown in Fig. 4, namelyEMI10.1 Then, pIN5GIF54 was constructed by replacing theXbaI EcoRI fragment of pIN4GIF54 with the above DNA fragment. Escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid, W3110 pIN5GIF54, was found to produce hIFN y in an amount 4 times greater as compared with the case of W3110 pIN4GIF54 cf. Table 2 , indicating that the modification of the SD sequence according to the invention is effective.Furthermore, culture compositions containing hIFN y in high concentrations could be obtained from the cultured cells of said fransformant. In the example of the invention, ampicillinresistant gene is inserted as a drug resistant gene into the plasmid of the invention ref. Fig.s 2 and 4 , however, the drug resistant gene is not limited to the example, and other known drug resistant genes may be employed. For instnce, well known tetracyclineor kanamycin resistant gene may be used instead of the ampicillin resistant gene without injuring the essence of the invention. The drawings are briefly explained as follows Fig. 1 shows the base sequence of the 5 terminal untranslated region of the Escherichia coli lipoprotein gene, which includes the promoter region and SD sequence, on the plasmid pINIA2 and part upstream portion of the structural gene for said protein.Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the construction of the hIFN y gene expression plasmid vector pIN4GIF45. Fig. 3 shows the base sequence covering the improved 5 terminal untranslated region of the lipoprotein gene on the plasmid pIN4GIF54. Fig. 4 schematically illustrates the construction of the hIFN y gene expression plasmid vector pIN5GIF54. Fig. 5 shows the base sequence covering the improved 5 terminal untranslated region of the lipoprotein gene on the plasmid pIN5GIF54. Fig. 6 shows the bases sequence of a chemically synthesized hIFN y gene and the corresponding amino acid sequence. Fig. 7 and Fig.8 schematically illustrate the construction of the plasmids PIN5T4 and PIN5T5, respectively. The following examples illustrate the invention in more detail. ExamplesI. Construction of pIN4GIF54 The plasmid pIN4GIF54 was constructed, as shown inFig. 2, from 1 DNA fragment containing the lipoprotein gene promoter region indicated by lpp in the figure as obtained by digestion of the plasmid pINIA2 with the restriction enzymes XbaI and PstI, 2 oligonucleotide having XbaI and EcoRI cohesive ends and 3 DNA fragment containing the hINF y gene as obtained by digestion of the plasmid pGIF54 with EcoRI and PstI.The procedure followed was as described hereinbelow.The restriction enzymes used were all products ofTakara Shuzo KK.A Preparation of XbaI PstI DNA fragment of pINAI2 The pINIA2 DNA 3 pg was digested with 15 units each of XbaI and PstI in 150 ul of 1 X TA solution 33 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.6, 66 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol at 370C for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was subjected to 1.08 agar gel electrophoresis and a gel portion located at the position corresponding to about 980 b.p. base pairs was cut out and placed in a dialysis tube, and the XbaI PstI DNA fragment was eluted by electrophoresis. After removal of ethidium bromide from the eluate by adding an equal amount of phenol thereto, 2.5 volumes of ethanol was added.After standing at 800C for 30 minutes, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, whereby theDNA fragment was obtained as an ethanol precipitate.To this ethanol precipitate was added 10 ul of distilled water for dissolving the DNA fragment.B Preparation of EcoRI PstI DNA fragment of pGIF54. The pGIF54 DNA 3 pg was digested with 15 units each of EcoRI and PstI in 30 pl of 1 X TA solution at 370C for 60 minutes, followed by 0.78 agar gel electrophoresis, whereby an EcoRI PstI DNA fragment of about 3.4 Kb was eluted from the gel. The eluate was subjected to phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation in the same manner as above. To the ethanol precipitate, 10 p1 of distilled water was added for dissolution of the DNA fragment.C Preparation of oligonucleotide having XbaI and EcoRI cohesive ends For the expression of complete hINF y protein, an oligonucleotide having the Shine Dalgarno SD sequence downstream from the XbaI cleavage site of pINIA2 and further having an EcoRI cohesive end, namely the oligonucleotide SD EMI14.1 XbaI cohesive end EcoRI cohesive end was synthesized by the solid phase method. The synthetic procedure has been disclosed in detail inJapanese Patent Application No. 86,180 1982. The above oligonucleotide 100 picomoles was phosphorylated at the 5 OH in 30 ijl of a kinase reaction solution 50 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgC12, 10 mM dithiothreitol , with 2 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase Takara Shuzo KK added, at 370C for 60 minutes. D Construction of pIN4GIF54 The plasmid pIN4GIF54 was constructed by ligation of the three DNA fragments prepared above in accordance with the following procedure. Thus, to a mixture of 5 p1 of a solution of the XbaI PstI DNA fragment of pINIA2 solution of the ethanol precipitate in 10 ul of distilled water , 5 ijl of a solution of the EcoRI PstIDNA fragment of pGIF54 solution of the ethanol precipitate in 10 jil of distilled water and 3 p1 of a solution of the phosphorylated oligonucleotide 10 picomoles , there were added 2 jil of a ligation reaction medium 10 fold higher in concentration 20 mMTris hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgC12 , 2 p1 of 4 mM ATP and 1 p1 of a solution of T4 DNA ligase Boehringer Mannheim 5 units , and the ligation was carried out at 16 C overnight. II. Transformation of Escherichia coliA Transformation of Escherichia coli WA802 Escherichia coli WA802 was cultured in 2.0 ml ofL broth at 370C overnight, 0.3 ml of the culture broth was added to 30 ml of L broth, and shake culture was performed at 370C for 2 hours, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. To the thus obtained cells was added 10 ml of 50 mM Caul2 for suspending the cells, and centrifugation was conducted at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. To the thus obtained cells was added 1.0 ml of 50 mM Caul2 solution, and the mixture was allowed to stand in an ice bath for 60 minutes.To 0.2 ml of this suspension of Ca treated cells was added 10 ul of the ligation reaction mixture obtained in Example I D containing the above mentioned three DNA fragments ligated , the mixture was allowed to stand in an ice bath for 60 minutes, them 2 ml of L broth was added and incubation was conducted at 370C for 60 minutes. The culture broth was used for plating a nutrient agar medium BBL containing 40 pg ml of ampicillin. After incubation at 370C overnight, ampicillin resistant transformants were selected. One of the transformants obtained was used for plasmid DNA separation therefrom by the conventional method cleared lysate method .The base sequence of the DNA at and around the XbaI EcoRI region inserted was determined by the Maxam Gilbert method Methods in Enzymology, 65 499 560, 1980 and it was confirmed that the DNA had the desired DNA base sequence. This plasmid was named pIN4GIF54 and the transformant Escherichia coli strain carrying the same was named WA802 pIN4GIF54. The base sequence of pIN4GIF54 at and around the promoter is shown in Fig. 4. In this pIN4GIF54, theShine Dalgarno SD sequence is the same as that in pINIA2 and the distance between the SD sequence and the translation initiation codon ATG for hIFN y is 9 b.p., which is the same as in pINIA2. Nevertheless, owing to the EcoRI cleavage site introduced between the SD sequence and translation initiation codon ATG, modification of the SD sequence and of the distance between the SD sequence and translation initiation codon can be made with ease and therefore this vector is considered to be an advantageous vector for use in constructing high expression vectors not only for the hIFN y gene but also for other genes. B Transformation of Escherichia coli W3110 The pIN4GIF54 plasmid obtained was used for transformation of Escherichia coli by the above mentioned method. Ampicillin resistant strains were isolated and one of the transformants was namedW3110 pIN4GIF54. This transformant was tested for antiviral activity. III. Test of transformant W3110 pIN4GIF54 for antiviral activity For examining the amount of hIFN y expressed, W3110 pIN4GIF54 and, for comparison, W3110 pGIF54 essentially the same strain as the transformant disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No.86,180 1982 and deposited with the FermentationResearch Institute under Deposit No. 6522 were cultivated in the manner mentioned below and the culture supernatants were assayed for antiviral activity. The host strain W3110 was used as a control. The strains W3110 pIN4GIF54 and W3110 were cultivated in 2.0 ml of L broth containing 40 pg ml of ampicillin at 370C overnight, 0.1 ml of the culture broth was used for inoculation of 5 ml of L broth, and incubation was performed at 370C for 4 hours. With W3110 pGIF54, 0.1 ml of a preculture broth was used for inoculation of 5 ml of the same L broth as above, incubation was conducted at 370C for 2 hours, then isopropyl ss D thiogalactopyranoside hereinafter abbreviated as IPTG was added in a final concentration of 1 mbl and the incubation was continued for further 2 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifuging 4 ml of each culture broth at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes. To the cells obtained, there was added 200 jil of 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mM Nail, pH 7.2, containing 1 mg ml of lysozyme Sigma, USA hereinafter abbreviated as 1 X PBS . The mixture was allowed to stand on an ice bath for 30 minutes to thereby effect bacteriolysis. Thereafter, the lysate was frozen quickly with dry ice methanol and then thawed quickly in a constant temperature bath maintained at 370C.After disintegration of the cells by three repetitions of such freezing and thawing treatment, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was assayed for antiviral activity by the method described in Japanese Patent Application No.86,180 1982. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Antiviral activity of transformants Strain Antiviral activity I.u. ml W3110 0 W3110 pGIF54 400 W3110 pIN4GIF54 1000 The antiviral activity was completely lost at pH 2.Neutralization with a hIFN y specific antibody also resulted in complete inactivation, whereas antibodies specific to a type and B type interferons practically failed to cause inactivation. As seen in Table 1, W3110 pIN4GIF54 showed 2.5 times higher antiviral activity as compared withW3110 pGIF54. However, the degree of expression cannot yet be said to be satisfactory. Therefore, the lipoprotein SD sequence was modified. The lipoproteinSD sequence is GAGG 4 bp and this sequence is complementary to the sequence CUCC indicated below byEMI20.1 of the 3 terminalEMI20.2 ofEscherichia coli 16S ribosome RNA. The inventors expected that conversion of the lipoprotein SD sequence complementary to said 16S ribosome RNA to AGGAGGT which is used in the R17A orMS2A protein SD sequence might result in an increase in complementarity with 168 ribosome RNA, hence in translation activity, so that the expression of the hIFN y protein could be increased, Therefore, they attempted to insert the SD sequence AGGAGGT between the XbaI EcoRI sites of the plasmid pIN4GIF54. For that purpose, an oligonucleotide having the above sequence as well asXbaI and EcoRI cohesive ends at the 5 ends, namely CTAGGAGGTAG CTCCATCTTAA and this was inserted between XbaI EcoRI of pIN4GIF54, whereby the plasmid pIN5GIF54 was constructed cf.Fig. 4 . THe following are the details.IV. Construction of pIN5GIF54 plasmid cf. Fig. 4 A Preparation of oligonucleotide having XbaI and EcoRI cohesive ends The oligonucleotide having the SD sequence AGGAGGT and XbaI and EcoRI cohesive ends at the 5 ends, namely 5,C T A G G A G G T A G3 3 C T C C A T C T T A A was synthesized by the solid phase method mentioned above cf. Japanese Patent Application No.86,180 1982 . The above oligonucleotide 100 picomoles was phosphorylated at the 5 OH, at 370C for 60 minutes, in 50 pl of the kinase reaction solution detailedly described in Example I C with 2 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase Takara Shuzo added, as mentioned above.B Preparation of XbaI EcoRI DNA fragment of pIN4GIF54 plN4GIF54 2.5 pg was digested with 5 units each of XbaI and EcoRI in 30 ul of 1 X TA solution at 370C for 60 minutes for cleaving the DNA. After cleavage, 0.7 agar gel electrophoresis was carried out and anXbaI EcoRI DNA fragment of about 4.3 Kb SD sequencefree longer fragment was eluted from the gel by electrophoresis as mentioned above. The eluate was subjected to phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation as mentioned above and, to the ethanol precipitate, 10 pl of distilled water was added for dissolution of theDNA fragment.C Construction of pIN5GIF54 The plasmid pIN5GIF54 was constructed by ligating the above two DNA fragments in the following manner.Thus, to 5 pl a solution of the phosphorylated oligonucleotide 10 picomoles , there were added 3 ul of the ligation reaction solution 10 fold in concentration mentioned hereinbefore , 10 ul of 100 mMDTT and 4 mM ATP in distilled water, and 1 ul 5 units of T4 DNA ligase Boehringer Hannheim . The mixture was incubated at 160C overnight.V. Transformation of Escherichia coliA Transformation of Escherichia coli WA802 In the same manner as above Example II A , cells of Escherichia coli WA802 as grown in L broth were treated with Caul2, and 0.2 ml of cell suspension was mixed with the ligation reaction mixture obtained inExample IV C for effecting transformation ofEscherichia coli WA802. Transformant selection was conducted using a nutrient agar medium BBL containing 40 pg ml of ampicillin. Using one of the transformant strains thus obtained, plasmid separation was performed by the conventional method cf. Example II A , and theDNA base sequence at and around the insert region, namely XbaI EcoRI region, was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5, pIN5GIF54 must be free of the XbaI cleavage site originally present in pIN4GIF54 fig. 3 . Therefore, the plasmid separated was treated with XbaI, followed by 0.78 agar gel electrophoresis and determination, for the plasmid DNA remaining uncleaved with XbaI, of the DNA sequence at and around the oligonucleotide fragment insert by the Naxam Gilbert method. The results obtained confirmed the presence of the intended DNA base sequence. This plasmid was named pIN5GIF54, and the WA802 strain transformed therewith was named WA802 pIN5GIF54.B Transformation of Escherichia coli W3110 The pIN5GIF54 plasmid obtained above was used for transformation of Escherichia coli V73110 in the same manner as above. An ampicillin resistant transformant was isolated and named W3llO pIN5GIF54. This transformant was compared with W3110 pIN4GIF54 with respect to antiviral activity.VI. Test of W3110 pIN4GIF54 and W3110 pIN5GIF54 for antiviral activity W3110 pIN4GIF54, W3110 pIN5GIF54 and, as a control, W3110 were each grown in 2.0 ml of L broth containing 40 pg ml of ampicillin at 370C overnight, and 0.1 ml of each culture broth was used for inoculating 5 ml of L broth containing 40 g ml of ampicillin , followed by further cultivation for 2 hours. A 2 ml portion of each culture broth was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes. To the cells thus obtained was added 1.0 ml of 1 X PBS containing 1 mg ml of lysozyme, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 minutes to effect bacteriolysis.Thereafter, the cells were disintegrated by three respective repetitions of rapid freezing with dry ice methanol and rapid thawing at 370C, and the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes was assayed for antiviral activity by the method described inJapanese Patent Application No. 86,180 1982. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Antiviral activity measurement Strain I.u. ml W3110 0 W3110 pIN4GIF54 1000 W3110 pIN5GIF54 4000 As is evident from Table 2, W3110 pIN5GIF54 exhibited 4 times higher antiviral activity as compared with W3110 pIN4GIF54, indicating that the improvement in the SD sequence had been effective in increasing the expression yield of hIFN y protein. Escherichia coli W311D transformed by plasmidsPIN5T4 and PIN5T5 wherein tetracycline resistant gene Tcr is inserted insteadof ampicillin resistant gene Apr on PIN5GIF54 exhibited the same antiviral activity as W3110 PIN5GIF54 mentioned above. PIN51 4 was prepared by the ligation of DNA fragment containing lsIFN r gene and DNA fragment containing Tc gene with T4DNA ligase after making the cohesive ends to smooth ends with T4DNA polymerase and dNTP. The former DNA fragment was obtained by cleaving PINS GIF54 with restriction enzymes AatII and SalI, and the latter by cleaving pBR322 with EcoRI and AhaIII Fig. 7 . PIN5T5 was able to be prepared by the same procedure as above except for cleaving pBR322 with EcoRI and PstI Fig. 8 . The antiviral activity disappeared upon treatment at pH 2 and upon neutralization with a hIFN y specific antibody. These facts clearly indicate that these transformants are hIFN y producing strains.
