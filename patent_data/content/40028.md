# Water softening and reverse osmosis treatment system.

## Abstract
A system for the combined softening of water and reduc tion of dissolved solids from the water, which can be retro fitted to a conventional water softening apparatus, is dis closed. The system includes a pressure tank 10 having a closure 12 with an access opening 20 an inlet line 16 for conveying hard water to the pressure tank 10 , an outlet line 18 for conveying softened water from the tank 10 and having a mouth 22 located proximate the bottom of the tank, pelletized treatment material 28 located within the pressure tank 10 for softening the raw water, and a plurality of mem brane element means 30 embedded within the treatment material. Each membrane element means includes a semi permeable reverse osmosis membrane 36 enclosing a tubu lar membrane carrier 32 . A conduit 57, 62 for collecting the purified water from the membrane carrier is provided.
