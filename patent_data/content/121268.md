# Flat card shaped semiconductor device with electric contacts on both faces and process for its manufacture.

## Abstract
Two superimposed series of electric contacts 3, 4 in the shape of metal sheet strips, electrically connected to a metallic place 2 which supports a semiconductor chip 5 , are electrically separated but mechanically connected by an interposed layer of adhesive material 8 at high insulation. The whole is completely inserted in a covering 14 of insulat ing material, which forms a flat support, from which, at oppo site faces, only limited adjacent contact portions 9, 10 of said electric contacts emerge. The place 2 and at least one of the two series of contacts 3, 4 make part of a single starting metallic frame 1 on which the other series of contacts is superimposed. This latter in its turn can make part of the same metallic frame 1 and to be superimposed by refolding or can be prepared separately and then applied on the first series.
