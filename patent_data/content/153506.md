# A method for preparing a concentrated stable water in oil emulsion containing at least 40 weight percent of a water soluble polymer.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a method for preparing a concentrated stable water in oil emulsion containing at least 40 weight percent of a water soluble polymer, which method comprises as steps of 1 forming a stable water in oil emulsion containing at least one water soluble monomer in an aqueous phase which is dispersed in a continuous oil phase, said emulsion of monomer containing an emulsifying amount of a water in oil emulsifier 2 subjecting said paper, emulsion of monomer to conditions sufficient to polymerize the monomer thereby forming a stable water in oil precon centrate emulsion of a water soluble polymer and 3 concentrating said preconcentrate emulsion by removing at least a portion of the water from the perconcentrate emul sion. The invention is characterized in that prior to or during step 3 , an inverting surfactant is added in an amount sufficient to reduce the bulk viscosity of the preconcentrate emulsion, but less than that which destabilizes the precon centrate emulsion or the concentrated emulsion. The concentrated emulsions prepared by the process of this invention are superior to conventional emulsions in that they have increased polymer solids, reduced oil content, lower bulk viscosity and greater stability than are character istic in the conventional emulsions containing about 30 weight percent of solids. In addition to their utility as additives in drilling muds, fracturing fluids and fluid mobility control agents in en hanced oil recovery methods, the emulsions prepared by the process of the present invention are also useful as flocculat ing agents for sewages, industrial wastes, mining streams such as coal slurries and mining effluents, as thickeners for coating formulations and as additives for the manufacture of paper.
