## Description
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a device, in which method an intermediate layer is formed from a first photosensitive lacquer on a substrate surface and is covered with a top layer formed from a second photosensitive lacquer, the top layer is patternwise exposed to radiation and is then developed so as to form an apertured mask, the intermediate layer then being exposed to radiation using the developed top layer as a mask, the second photosensitive lacquer comprising a binder, a positive acting photosensitizer and a solvent in which the intermediate layer is only slightly soluble. The method according to the invention is used, for example, in the manufacture of a semiconductor device. The invention additionally relates to a device manufactured by means of the method according to the invention and to a photosensitive lacquer. The method mentioned in the opening paragraph is described in the publication Materials for multilevel resist schemes by E. Reichmanis, C.W. Wilkins, Jr. and E. Ong, in Polymer Engineering and Science, The said publication describes how a transition layer is formed at the interface between the first and the second lacquer layers and this causes difficulties when exposing and developing the intermediate layer, It is the object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing a device by using a bilayer photosensitive lacquer system in which the formation of the transition layer takes place to a considerably reduced extent. For that purpose, the method described in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the binder is selected from the group of polymers which is formed by polyhydroxystyrenes and halogenated polyhydroxystyrenes. Upon developing, the top layer shows an especially large solubility difference between the exposed and unexposed parts in an embodiment of the method according to the invention which is characterized in that the binder is poly para hydroxystyrene. The formation of the transition layer is counteracted to a particularly strong extent if the binder is a brominated poly para hydroxystyrene compound having on an average 1 to 2 substituted bromine atoms per phenyl group. A preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention is characterized in that the binder is poly 2,4 dihydroxystyrene . Although the use of polyhydroxystyrene also termed polyvinylphenol in a multilayer system has been described in the publication Multilayer resists for fine line optical lithograph by E. Ong and E.H. Hu in Solid State Technology, June 1984, Suitable positive acting photosensitizers are multiple esters of trihydroxybenzophenone and 2 diazo 1 naphthoquinone 4 sulphonyl chloride of 2 diazo 1 naphthoquinone 5 sulphonyl chloride. The tri esters or a mixture of bi esters and tri esters are preferably used. Photosensitive lacquers based on polyhydroxystyrene and esters of o quinone diazide sulphonic acid are described in German Patent Application DE 3309222, but the use in a bilayer system is not described therein. The lacquers according to the said German Patent Application are not suitable for use in the method according to the invention because the solvents used, for example 2 ethoxy ethyl acetate, enhance the formation of a transition layer. The transmission of light having a wavelength of 200 nm through the transition layer exceeds 80 , which indicates a very thin transition layer, if in the method according to the invention the solvent of the second photosensitive lacquer is selected from the group formed by cyclohexanone and 2 ethoxy ethanol. The top layer can be developed in the conventional manner, for example, by using a metal ion free basic solution, for example trismethyl ammonium hydroxide in water. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the intermediate layer comprises a polymer or a copolymer of methyl methacrylate. Very suitable is polymethyl methacrylate, but copolymers with, for example, other alkyl methacrylates, methyl acrylate and methacrylonitrile can also be used successfully. The intermediate layer can be developed in a conventional manner. The intermediate layer may, for example be developed by using a solvent, for example methyl isobutyl ketone by which the remainders of the top layer are also dissolved. In connection with the further treatments to which the device is subjected for example chemical etching, ion etching or deposition of a metal layer, succeeded by removal of the remainders of the intermediate layer , it may be of importance for the remainders of the top layer to remain on the developed intermediate layer as an extra protection. In such a case it is efficacious for the intermediate layer to be developed with a solvent selected from the group formed by chlorobenzene, xylene and toluene. Embodiments of the method according to the invention and comparative examples will be described in greater detail with reference to the drawing, in which Figure 1 A top layer 4 using a second photosensitive lacquer, is then provided, for example, also by spinning. Said photosensitive lacquer consists of 17 by weight of poly para hydroxystyrene as a binder molecular weight 1500 7000 of Messrs. Polyscience Inc. , 78 by weight of cyclohexanone as a solvent and 5 by weight of the tri ester of 2,3,4 trihydroxybenzophenone and 2 diazo 1 naphthoquinone 5 sulphonyl chloride as a photosensitive component Figure 3 A transition layer 5 is formed at the interface between the intermediate layer 3 and the top layer 4. This layer is very thin and does not cause the problems occurring when other binders and solvents are used in the second photosensitive lacquer. The transmission of light through the transition layer is 90 at a wavelength of 200 nm and 95 at 220 nm. For comparison a transition layer having a thickness of not more than 30 nm which is formed when a known photosensitive lacquer HPR 204 of Messrs. Hunt on the basis of novolak is used causes a transmission of only 30 at 220 nm. The transmission is measured by an absorption determination on a quartz substrate with polymethylmethacrylate as the reference. The substrate 1 with the photosensitive lacquer layers 3 and 4 is exposed in the form of a pattern through a mask not shown by means of light in a wavelength range from 350 450 nm see Figure 1 The exposed parts of the top layer 4 are dissolved see Figure 1 The substrate 1 with the photosensitive layers 3 and 4 is then exposed throughout the surface to parallel UV radiation having a wavelength of 190 250 nm see Figure 1 The exposed part of the intermediate layer 3 is then dissolved in toluene, apertures being formed in the intermediate layer having side walls extending substantially perpendicularly to the substrate 1, the remainders of the top layer 4 not being dissolved Figure 1 The pattern formed in the intermediate layer 3 may be used in various conventional manners in the further manufacture of the device. The pattern may serve as a mask in a chemical or plasma etching treatment or ion implantation. It is also possible Figure 1 Figure 2 This pattern is used as a mask during etching of the conductive layer 16. Etching may be carried out in any known manner, for example, by chemical etching or by etching with reactive ions. A pattern Figure 2 The width of the conductor tracks, for example 17 and 18, is determined by the mask used in the first exposure and by the nature of the further processes, but hardly by the presence of steps or bosses 12 on the substrate 11, as a result of which track width variations at the crossings of such steps occur only to a small extent. In the method according to the invention other solvents may also be used in the second photosensitive lacquer, provided the solvent does not attack the intermediate layer 3. Particularly suitable is, for example, 2 ethoxy ethanol the use of which even results in the measured transmission through the transition layer 5 being larger than when cyclohexanone is used, which indicates a still thinner transition layer 5. The overall concentration of binder and photosensitizer in the lacquer may be adapted at will. In order to obtain a good spinnability this overall concentration is, for example, 10 to 40 by weight, preferably approximately 25 by weight. The ratio of binder to photosensitizer in the composition of the second photosensitive lacquer can freely be chosen within certain limits. If the ratio of binder to photosensitizer is greater than 8 1, however, the rate of dissolution of the unexposed part of the top layer becomes too large, for example more than 1 Âµm min, as a result of which the top layer 4 shows little selectivity. On the other hand it is not advisable to choose a ratio smaller than 2 1 because there is no further improvement of the result. Due to the comparatively high cost of the photosensitizer a ratio of approximately 3 1 is to be preferred. Poly para hydroxystyrene is used as a binder in the above described example. Poly ortho hydroxystyrene and poly 2,4 dihydroxystyrene may also be used in the lacquer layer 4 in the method according to the invention. When brominated poly para hydroxystyrene compounds with on an average 1.5 bromine atoms per phenyl ring are used, the transmission of light of a wavelength of 220 nm through the transition layer 5 is even more than 98 . When the brominated compounds are used it is necessary to further dilute the developer, for example, in a ratio of 1 4 to 1 8, with water, the rate of developing decreasing. Because the problems with the transition layer are considerably reduced in the method according to the invention, there is more freedom in the choice of the molecular weight and the glass transition temperature of the binder and in the drying temperature than, for example, when novolak is used. Poly para hydroxystyrene having a molecular weight between 1,500 and 30,000 has proved to be useful, the molecular weight preferably being smaller than 7,000 All molecular weights stated are number averaged molecular weights of the polymer molecules . The glass transition temperature of polyhydroxystyrene is approximately 200 C, that of novolak, dependent on the type, 100 130 C. The result of this is that the mobility of the polyhydroxystyrene molecules remains low and little interdiffusion takes place between the top layer and the intermediate layer, as a result of which the formation of a transition layer is suppressed. The transmission values recorded in the Table are measured at a wavelength of 200 nm through the transition layer which is formed on polymethyl methacrylate when various combinations of binders and solvents in the second photosensitive lacquer are used to form the top layer. The novolak PN 430 of Messrs. Hoechst comprises a diazoquinone as a photosensitive component, the poly hydroxystyrenes of Messrs. Polyscience Inc. comprise the above described tri ester Figures 3 It has proved possible by means of the method according to the invention to make well defined patterns with tracks having a width which is smaller than 1 Âµm, in which the width does not vary substantially if such a track crosses a step on the surface of the substrate. It will be obvious that the above described method permits many modifications without departing from the scope of this invention. The method may also be applied to other substrate materials and to multilayer substrates. Other acrylate or methacrylate containing polymers which are sensitive to radiation of short wave UV light may also be used for the intermediate layer.
