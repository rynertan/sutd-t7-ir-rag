# Relational algebra engine.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a relational algebra engine which has a sort engine SE , a merge engine ME , a control processor CP and a common bus BUS . The sort engine has a plurality of first processing elements PE1, PE2,..., PEn which are connected in series. Each first processing element includes first and second buffer memories M11, M21..., Mn1 M13, M23,..., Mn3 , a first memory which has a FIFO function B12, B22,..., Bn2 , and a first processor P1, P2,..., Pn which sorts input data elements in accordance with a predetermined rule by using the first and second buffer memories and the first memory which has the FIFO function. The first and second buffer memories and the first memory which has the FIFO function are disposed in parallel. The merge engine has two second processing elements RP1, RP2 which are disposed in parallel. Each second processing element includes a third buffer memory M01, M02 , a second memory which has the FIFO function B01, B02 , a second processor P01, P02 which merges the data elements sorted in the sort engine by using the third buffer memory and the second memory which has the FIFO function and an output buffer memory OB1, OB2 which stores the data elements merged in the second processor. The third buffer memory is disposed parallel to the second memory which has the FIFO function.
