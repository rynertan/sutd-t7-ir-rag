## Description
Single grip lever water tapThe present invention relates to a single grip lever water tap in which the amount and temperature of mixed water are adjusted by raising and lowering the lever, the temperature being adjusted by turning the lever, and the movable lever and the stationary body have stop means working in conjunction with each other to limit the preselected extreme position of the turning movement of the lever, and to a single grip lever tap in which the amount and temperature of mixed water are adjusted by raising and lowering the lever, the temperature being adjusted by turning the lever, and the movable lever and the stationary body have stop means working in conjunction with each other to limit the preselected extreme position of the turning movement of the lever, the lever being additionally equipped with user controlled release means by the moving of which the said extreme position limit can be overridden.A single grip lever tap of this type is previously known from, for example, DE patent 34 02 103. It has a springloaded pressbutton attached with bearings to the control lever, and, attached to the pressbutton, a pin working in conjunction with the stop in the body of the tap, in which case the limiting pin can pass beyond the said stop when the pressbutton is pressed. In terms of manufacture, this structure has a disadvantage in its complicated structure and partial weakness of material, which is, among other things, dependent on the strength of the pin. In addition such a pin structure is cumbersome. if it is desired that it will function smoothly in the different turning and lifting positions of the lever. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a single grip lever tap having a possibility of limiting the temperature and having a button enabling this stop to be overridden, but in such a way that the structure of the tap is not immoderately complicated and that the limiting mechanism is at the same time both reliable in operation and has a long useful life. In order to accomplish this, the lever tap according to the invention is characterized in that the stop means in the body is a shoulder formed in the cup like part below the central part of the lever and parallel to the side line of the cup, and that the stop in the lever is a stop part oriented towards the said shoulder and normally engaging it, the stop part being raisable over the shoulder.According to one advantageous embodiment of the invention the release means consists of a trigger attached so that it can turn inside the central part, one of its ends serving as the stop part in the lever and the other end being capable of being affected from outside the lever.One end of the trigger can be shaped into a pressbutton which protrudes from an opening at the root of the lever.Certain advantageous features and details of the invention are disclosed in greater detail in the unindependent claim and in the following description, in which reference is made to the accompanying drawings.Figure 1 depicts a cross section of the upper part of a single grip lever tap, the part being, according to one embodiment, equipped with the mechanism according to the invention,Figure 2 depicts a top view of the lever tap according to Figure 1,Figure 3 depicts a top view of the trigger, Figure 4 depicts a cross section of the protective cup of the upper part of the tap,Figure 5 depicts a top view of the protective cup,Figures 6 and 7 depict another embodiment of the protective cup, in a manner corresponding to that inFigures 4 and 5,Figure 8 depicts another embodiment of the single grip lever tap according to the invention, deviating somewhat from that shown in Figure 1,Figure 9 depicts one more embodiment of the invention, andFigure 10 is a partial cross section along line A inFigure 9.Figure 1 thus shows a cross section of the upper part of a conventional single grip lever tap. The lower part, which in a manner known to an expert in the art includes the water mixing part with its ceramic plates, is not shown here. The movable lever of the tap comprises a protrusion, i.e. the actual lever 1, which is cut in the figure, the upper part la, the interior part lb, and the skirting part ic around the interior part, all of these parts making up one unit. This lever is attached by means of a screw to a spindle 2, which in a known manner moves the movable upper ceramic plate. The amount of mixed water is adjusted by raising and lowering the lever 1, and the temperature ofmixed water is adjusted by turning the lever to the right or to the left.With reference still to Figure 1, the turning movement of the lever 1 is limited as follows. The protective cup 4 fastened to the upper part of the body of the tap is designed so as to have a spherical exterior surface, and furthermore, a shoulder, or stop 14, parallel to the side line of the cup, has been made in this exterior surface.The end 9 of the trigger, oriented obliquely downwards, engages this stop, the trigger being turnably attached to the interior part lb of the lever, the opposite end of the trigger forming a pressbutton 6. When the lever 1 is turned in this case sufficiently far to the left to the hot side , part 9 of the trigger comes against the stop 14, thereby limiting the movement of the lever. When the pressbutton 6 is pressed downwards, the part 9 rises over the stop 14, whereupon the lever 1 can be turned further to the left, all the way to the extreme position.Figure 2 depicts a top view of the tap. The fastening screw of the lever 1 is covered by a covering plate 7, and the pressbutton 6 protrudes from the opening next to the covering plate 7.Figure 3 shows a top view of the trigger, which is in general indicated by numeral 8. The trigger is preferably made from a resilient strong plastic material. The end opposite in relation to the pressbutton 6 is preferably branched in such a way that the thinner, resilient tongue 10 at the same time forms a spring which keeps the part 9 in contact with the exterior surface of the protective cup 4. The trigger has in the middle a groove 11 having the shape of a partial cylinder, the groove leaning against a correspondingly designed area in part lb, thereby forming the turning axis of the trigger. In addition, the trigger is provided with a hole 12 through which the lever can be fastened to the spindle 2.The shape of the protective cup 4 is better seen inFigures 4 and 5. The outer surface 13 of the protective cup is mainly spherical in such a way that the center point of the spherical surface is the same as the center point of the movement of the lever 1. In this manner the part 9 of the trigger remains steadily against the surface 13 of the protective cup 4, regardless of the movements of the lever 1. The stop, or shoulder 14, protrudes from this spherical surface, as is best seen in Figure 4. The limiting position determined by the stop 14 can, furthermore, be selected by positioning the protective cup 4 in the desired manner in relation to the body of the tap.For this purpose the protective cup is provided with inside ring like toothing 15, which can engage a correspondingly shaped sleeve like part 5 fastened to the body, the part 5 being shown in Figure 1. Shifting the position of the protective cup 4 requires, of course, that the cover 7 of the lever tap be removed and the lever 1 be detached from the spindle 2, whereafter the protective cup 4 can be raised and positioned at a new angle.Figures 6 and 7 depict a slightly different embodiment of the protective cup. The protective cup is in other respects similar to that in Figures 4 and 5, but at the top the shoulder 14 is cut in such a way that a second shoulder 14a, extending towards the periphery, is formed. The purpose of this shoulder is to prevent the tap from being opened from the closed position when the lever 1 has been turned beyond the limit position determined by the stop L4. For this purpose the part 9 of the lever 8 is so long that, when the tap is in the closed position, the lower end of the part 9 remains just above the shoulder 14a. In this case the trigger can be moved over the stop 14 when the tap is open, but a tap which has been turned to a position giving tbo hot water cannot be opened without first turning it to the permitted range. Figure 8 depicts an embodiment slightly different from that in Figure 1.The structure is the same as in Figure 1, but the end 17 of the trigger remains inside the upper part of the lever and is affected by means of a separate pressbutton 16 in the center, the pressbutton being loaded by a heLical spring 18 leaning against the central part lb. It is clear that even in this case the resilience could be in the trigger itself.Finally, Figures 9 and 10 depict one alternative embodiment, which has no trigger but in which the lever 1 itself can be lifted in order to release the limiting action. In this case the inner surface of the skirting part lc of the lever 1 is provided with a shoulder 19, which hits the shoulder 14 in the protective cup 4. When the lever 1 is in the normal position, the shoulder 19, as seen from above, remains on the right hand side of the shoulder 14, as seen in Figure 10. The limit position can be overridden by raising the entire lever 1 upwards, the spring 21 compressing between the head of the fastening screw 20 and the central part lb. If it is desired also to prevent the tap from being opened when the lever has in advance been turned to a position giving too hot water, the lower edge of the shoulder 14 must be cut and the corresponding point in the upper edge of the shoulder 19 must also be cut, so that an operation corresponding to that described in connection with Figures 6 and 7 is obtained.It is clear that the embodiments depicted in the drawings can be varied greatly without deviating from the idea of the invention.
