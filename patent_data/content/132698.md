# Improved cathodic electrocoating composition compounded with latex binder.

## Abstract
Improved cathodic electrocoating compositions comprising an aqueous suspension of synthetic, cation active, film forming latex particles are characterized by at least one of the following a a Tg of at least 20 DEG b a latex gel content not substantially above 10 and or c being practically free from amino monomer and initiator fragments. Such compositions have excellent deposition properties and result in coated metal substrates having improved gloss, adhesion surface characteristics and durability.
