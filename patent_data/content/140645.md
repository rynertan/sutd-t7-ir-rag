## Description
This invention relates to a method of fabricating a semiconductor light emitting device. In a prior art high speed responding light emitting diode of double hetero structure type of In Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings of the present application, an n InP substrate 1 is doped with Te at a density of 1 x 10¹⁸cm ³ a p InP clad layer is doped with Zn at a density of 3 x 10¹⁸cm Fig. 2 shows the carrier density profile of the layers of the light emitting diode having the structure shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, numerals 1,2,4,5 and 6 along the horizontal axis correspond to the reference numerals 1,2,4, 5 and 6 denoting the layers of the structure of Fig. 1. Since the p In Fig. 3 shows the energy band profile of the layers of Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, reference numerals 1,2,4,5 and 6 along the horizontal axis correspond to the reference numerals 1,2,4,5 and 6, respectively, denoting the layers in Figs. 1 and 2. When the junction is shifted into the n InP clad layer 2 as shown in Fig. 3, a portion of the carriers flow out from the p In Furthermore, since the remote junction makes the carrier enclosure incomplete, reduction in the response speed is inevitable, even when the p type impurity Zn is doped at a high density. To avoid the remote junction, it is conventional to provide sequentially the n InP layer 2 on the n InP substrate 1, the undoped In Fig. 4 shows the carrier density profile of a light emitting diode having the sequentially provided layers as described above. As shown by a broken line in Fig. 4, a p n junction is formed in the active layer 3 by diffusing Zn from the p InP clad layer 5 into the In The light emitting device produced by the method described above is, in spite of its high response speed, not suitable for high speed data transmission through optical fibres, because of the large half value width of its light emitting spectrum. That is, the data transmittable distance through optical fibres depends upon the half value width of the light emitting spectrum of the light emitting device as shown in Figure 6. In the case where the half value width is 160 nm, as shown by the curve b in Fig. 5, data transmission over a distance of 0.8 km or larger is practically impossible, as shown by a broken line in Fig. 6. The conventional light emitting device produced by Zn diffusion as described above has a further disadvantage that uneven Zn diffusion in the In According to the present invention there is provided a method of fabricating a semiconductor light emitting device comprising providing an n InP clad layer, forming an undoped In The present invention provides a method of fabricating a semiconductor light emitting device having an increased response speed and an intensified light emitting output. It can be used to form a semiconductor light emitting device having a narrowed half value width of the light emitting spectrum. The method of the present invention results in a structure which overcomes the difficulty of the conventional light emitting device, i.e. the remote junction, in which the p n junction position is formed within the n InP clad layer. Accordingly, the light emitting device produced by a method according to the present invention has important characteristics such as high response speed and light emitting output and a small half value width of light emitting spectrum, and can be used as a semiconductor light emitting device suitable for high speed data transmission through optical fibres. Furthermore, since the p n junction position is formed easily on the interface, or in its neighbourhood, between the n InP clad layer and the undoped In The invention will be better understood from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which With reference now to the drawings, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. Fig. 7 shows a structure of a semiconductor light emitting device according to the present invention, in which reference numeral 1 denotes an n InP substrate doped with Te in the density of 1 x 10¹⁸ cm ³. On the n InP substrate 1, there is formed an n InP clad layer 2 doped with Te at a density of 1 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, in the thickness of 5 µm, by epitaxial growth. On the n InP clad layer 2, there is formed an undoped In As described above, when the undoped In Fig. 8 shows the carrier density profile of the layers of the semiconductor light emitting device of Fig. 7, in which Zn of the p In In the present invention, the substrate and the layers thereon may take other values of thicknesses and carrier densities than those defined hereinabove with respect to the preferred embodiment. For example, the carrier density of the n InP substrate 1 may be 1 x 10¹⁸ 5 x 10¹⁸ cm ³ in which bulk resistance is low, the carrier density of the n InP clad layer 2 may be 1 x 10¹⁸ 5 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, and the dopant of said two layers may be Sn or S as well as Te. Further, the thickness of the n InP clad layer 2 may be 2 20 µm which is easily controllable during growth of the crystal. While the quantity of dopant of the p In Accordingly, the optimum value of the thickness of the undoped In to and assuming tht the dopant is any of Cd, Mg and Be, the optimum range of the thickness is, as seen from Fig. 11B, from to provided that the carrier density is defined as the number of carriers per cm³. The carrier density of the undoped In The carrier density of the p InP clad layer 5 is taken to be substantially equal to the carrier density of the p In
