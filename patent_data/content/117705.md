## Description
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SPECIFIC FOR MONOCYTES AND BLAST CELLS Monoclonal antibodies provide a sensitive tool for analyzing and detecting the presence of specific determinant sites. Many determinant sites of interest are found on highly complex structures, such as cells, where there are a seemingly limitless diversity of determinant sites. Frequently one is interested in being able to distinguish a particular type or group of cells which share common determinant site s for purposes of identification, separation or growth inhibition. One particular area where monoclonal antibodies may find widespread application is in immunosuppression of patients undergoing skin grafts and other transplant procedures, as well as in treatment of patients having certain immune system disorders. While certain monoclo nal antibodies specific for particular cell types have been used as immunosuppressants, the desired immunosuppression is often accompanied by adverse side effects.For example, treatment with OKT3 monoclonal antibody although generally effective, results in virtual depletion of normal blood lymphocytes leaving the patient susceptible to infection. Cosimi, et al. 1981 New Engl. J. Med. 305 308 314. It is thus desirable to provide monoclonal antibodies which afford immunosuppression without such adverse side effects. Unfortunately, despite the seeming simplicity of the above stated goal the preparation of hybridomas capable of producing antibodies having a desired specificity is problematic. The mixture of hybridomas which result from a fusion often contain few, if any, hybrido mae producing antibodies having high specificity for a determinant site of interest. The problem is intensified when it is desired to produce monoclonal antibodies specific for two or more cell types where it is unknown if the cell types have common determinant sites. Cosimi, et al. 1981 supra. described the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for certain T cell subsets for immunosuppression. Several anti blast hybridoma cell lines have been developed. See, e.g.,Omary, et al. 1980 Nature 286 888 891 B3 25 cell line Haynes, et al. 1981 J. Immunol. 127 347 351 5E9 cell line and Reinherz, et al. 1980 PNAS 77 1588 1592 OKT9 cell line . A polyclonal rabbit antiserum designated 157 which is specific for blast cells and peripheral blood monocytes has been developed.Billing, et al. 1979 Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol.13 435 443. According to the invention, irrn6clanal antibodies reactive with both monocytes and blast cells, the hybridomas which produce such monoclonal antibodies, and use of the monoclonal antibodies as immunosuppressants are provided. More specifically, mxcclonal antibodies which are specific for a determinant site common to both blast cells and monocytes are particularly useful in immunosuppression therapy for patients undergoing skin graft or other transplantation procedures. The subject monoclonal antibodies can also be used to identify and isolate the determinant site. The isolated determinant can then be used for the production of monoclonal antibodies specific to the same or substantially the same site as the subject monoclonal antibodies but which may differ in class. As used herein, the term blast cells includes those rapidly dividing, partially differentiated lymphoblastoid cells which are produced in response to antigenic challenge and which mature into B and T lymphocytes. The term monocyte includes all mononuclear phagocytes, specifically embracing macrophages which derive from monocytes. Preferably, the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention will lack specificity for normal peripheral blood cells other than monocytes. In particular, the subject antibody will not react with normal peripheral T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and granulocytes. In this way a patient treated for immunosuppression with the subject antibody will retain the existing blood population of T and B lymphocytes to fight bacterial, viral and fungal infection. The production of new B and T lymphocytes, however, is inhibited through the suppression of blast cells and monocytes, resulting in increased patient tolerance to the transplant or graft. The subject hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies are raised against a determinant site common to both blast cells and monocytes. Conveniently, blast cells or monocytes may be employed, either directly or as a source of the isolated determinant molecule. In particular, the antibodies may be raised against a cultured T acute lymphocytic leukemia T ALL cell line designated CEM. One monoclonal antibody raised against the CEM cell line designated CBL1, which has been deposited at the ATCC on 24 February 1983 under acession No. HB8214, displayed cytotoxicity against a broad range of malignant cells, as well as against normal monocytes and blast cells. CBL1 displayed no reactivity with normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or granulocytes. Ascites fluid containing the monoclonal antibody was successfully used to prolong skin allograft survival in Rhesus monkeys without apparent side effects. The subject hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies can be obtained substantially following the well known procedure of Kohler and Milstein, Fur. J.Immunol. 1976 6 511 591. The method involves hyperimmunization of a mammalian host, e g., a mouse, with the CEM cell line. Shortly after the last immunization, the host spleen is removed and the spleen cells fused with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas having a range of specificities. The hybridomas are selected on HAT media, and the supernatants screened for antibodies having the desired specificity. Those colonies which produce the desired antibodies may then be cloned by limiting dilution and grown out in flasks. Production of the desired antibodies may be enhanced by intraperitoneal injection of the hybridoma into a mammalian host to produce high titered ascites fluid.In contrast to antisera derived directly from an immunized host, the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are substantially free from immunoglobulins having differing specificities. The antibodies of the subject invention can be used to isolate the common determinant site. This can be readily achieved by a number of conventional techniques. For example, the antibody may be used to prepare an immunosorbent column By lysing the CEM cells, separating the cellular debris, and then passing the supernatant through the column, the molecules displaying the determinant will bind to the column.After washing the column to remove nonspecifically bound proteins, the antigen or determinant may be eluted, using detergents, urea, etc. in programmed gradient elution. The antigen may then be isolated and used to hyperimmunize an appropriate host followed by fusion of splenocytes with a fusion partner and screening for the desired hybridoma s . In this way, monoclonal antibodies having substantially identical specificities, but which differ in class, such as IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD, may be obtained. In addition, antibodies from a variety of different hosts, e.g., human, can be obtained. The subject antibodies are particularly useful for immunosuppressive treatment. For such use, it is desirable to employ antibodies of class IgM, IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG3 which activate the hosts own complement system to reduce the population of blast cells and monocytes.Alternatively, antibodies of any class may be coupled to cytotoxic agents to provide a composition lethal to blast cells and monocytes, but relatively nonlethal to the remainder of the normal peripheral blood population.Suitable cytotoxic agents include chlorambucil Ghose et al., 1972 , Cancer 29, 1398 1400 and Ghose et al. 1972 Br. Med. J. 3 495 499 , 131I Ghose et al. 1975 ,Cancer 36 1646 1657 , whole diphtheria toxin Moolten et al. 1972 J. Natl.

Chem. 254 1022 1027 and Oeltmann et al., ibid, 254 1028 1032 . For administration to a patient, the antibodies will normally be combined with a physiologically acceptable media, such as saline, phosphate buffered saline, serum, water, or other convenient carrier. The antibodies can be administered in a variety of ways, conveniently intravenously. The subject antibodies will also find use in screening assays, particularly for the immunological classification of leukemia. Lymphoid leukemias can be divided into immunological subsets depending on the particular surface antigens displayed by the malignant cells. For example, CBL1 antibody is reactive with three out of the four generally recognized morphological types of leukemia, being nonreactive with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . CBL1 would thus be useful, in combination with other antibodies having different specificities, in clinical diagnosis of a patient having leukemia. Malignant lymphocyte cells which are incapable of reacting with CBL1 would be presumed to beCLL. The following experimental results are offered by way of example and not by way of limitation. EXPERIMENTAL The following abbreviations are employed ALL acute lymphocytic leukemia AML acute myelomic leukemia AMML acute myelomonocytic leukemia CML chronic myelocytic leukemia CLL chronic lymphocytic leukemia PBS phosphate buffered saline PAGE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PHA phytohemagglutinin RBC red blood cell SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate and WBC white blood cell. MATERIAL AND METHODSCells Leukemia Cells Heparinized peripheral blood samples were drawn from children and adults with active leukemia. The acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and acute myelocytic leukemia AML patients had peripheral blood blast counts greater than 90 . Leukemia cells from patients and peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors were isolated by Ficoll Hypaquel density gradient centrifugation. Leukemia cells were stored in liquid nitrogen. Cell lines were grown in suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 containing 10 heat inactivated fetal calf serum. T and B Lymphocytes T and B lymphocytes were prepared from whole lymphocytes by the nylon wool method. Danilovs, et al. 1980 HistocompatibilityTesting 1980, Terasaki ed. UCLA Tissue Typing Laboratory, Los Angeles, CA., pp. 287 288. PHA Blasts Whole peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated by the Ficoll Hypaq technique were cultured at 2.5x106 ml in media 199 M199 with 20 human AB serum heat inactivated at 370C with 50pg ml of Difco PHA under sterile conditions for 3 6 days. Control lymphocytes were incubated in M199 with 20 human AB serum without PHA. At the end of the culture period, cells were removed, washed, and tested by microcytotoxicity against the blast sera. Monocytes Monocytes were isolated using a Percolle density gradient. Gutierrez, et al. 1979 Immunol. Meth. 29 57 63. Briefly, the thrombin pellet from lymphocyte isolation containing monocytes, platelets, and granulocytes was washed and resuspended in 65 Percolle in PBS by volume . Then 55 Percoll, 40 Percoll commat , and McCoy s media were layered, respectively, over the suspension and centrifuged at 3200 x g for 10 min with the brake off. The monocytes were recovered from the 40 55 Percolle interface, diluted with media and washed. Granulocytes Granulocytes were isolated from Ficolle pellets by removing RBCs by agglutination.The Ficolle pellet from lymphocyte isolation containing granulocytes and RBCs was suspended in McCoyls media and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 1 min and the buffy coat from the pellet removed. This process was repeated until the buffy coat was sufficiently enriched for granulocytes. The appropriate agglutinin anti A, B, AB, 0, and H was added and allowed to agglutinate fully. The clumps were then spun at 1500 x g for less than 1 sec and the supernatant layered over Ficolle 1.3545g ml and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 2 min.The granulocyte enriched pellet was then washed and tested against antiblast sera. This entire process was done in Fisher tubes using a Fisher,Model 59, centrifuge. Cytotoxicity A microcytotoxicity test was performed by adding 1p1 of antiserum at various dilutions to 1p1 of cell suspension 2000 cells in a microtest plate. The mixture was incubated at 220C for 30 min, 5p1 of rabbit complement was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 60 min. The reaction was then stained with eosin dye, fixed, and read for cytotoxicity. See,Billing, et al. 1979 Immunol. Immunopathol. 13 435 443.Antibodies Heteroantibody designated heteroantibody 157 to cell line CEM a lymphoblastoid T ALL cell line was raised in rabbits immunized with CEM cells.Billings et al 1979 , supra. Monoclonal antibodies against the CEM cell line were raised as follows. Two 6 week old femaleBalb c mice were immunized intravenously with 1 2x107CEM cells weekly for three weeks. Three days after the final injection the spleens were removed and a single cell suspension was made. Spleen cells were fused withP3X63Ag8 myeloma cells at a ratio of 3 1 with 50 polyethylene glycol. After the fusion, hybrid cells were selected by hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine treatment. After three weeks, supernatants were screened by microcytotoxicity against CEM cells. Several wells produced discriminating antibodies. One hybridoma,CBL1 which showed specificity for blast cells, was cloned and grown out in tissue culture flasks and as ascites in Balb c mice. Monoclonal antibodies against Ia positive leukemia cells Reh cell line were raised as follows.Female Balb c mice six weeks old were immunized intravenously with 2x107 Ia positive leukemia cells Reh at 14 day intervals. Four days after the third immunization the spleens were removed and a suspension of single cells was prepared. Cell fusions were carried out by fusing with mouse myeloma cells X63 according to the procedure developed by Kohler andMilstein 1976 Eur. J. Immunol. 6 511 519. After cell fusion the cells were distributed and cultured in selective medium. One hybrid clone produced a cytotoxic monoclonal antibody H4 that reacted with B cells and other Ia positive cells but not T cells. It was anIgG3 antibody that bound to protein A. By immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis, H4 reacted with the human Ia like antigen p.27,35 . Hocking et al. 1981 Blood 58 1040 1042.Immunoprecipitation and PolyacrylamideGel Electrophoresis Cells 5x106 per experiment were labeled with 1251 by the iodogen technique of Markwell and Fox 1978 Biochemistry 17 4807 4817, solubilized with 300ml 0.5 Nonidet commat P40, and immunoprecipitated with 20p1 of antiserum 157 bound to 40p1 protein A Sepharose 4B beads Pharmacia or 10p1 CBL1 bound to 40p1 rabbit antimouse IgM protein A Sepharose 4B. After washing three times with PBS, the precipitated antigens were released from the protein A by adding 50p1 2 SDS.They were boiled for 2 min with or without dithiothreitol and run on 5 and 7 gels. Fifty 2mm slices from each gel were counted on a gamma counter. Standard proteins of known molecular weight were also run in order to calculate the molecular weight of the precipitated antigens. The gel system used was that originally described by King and Laemmli 1971 J. Mol. Biol. 62 467 480, and used by Billing et al. 1978 J. Natl.Cancer Inst. 61 423 429 The molecular weight and protein standards used were lysozyme 14,400, soybean trypsin inhibitor 21,500, carbonic anhydrase 31,000, ovalbumin 45,000, bovine serum albumin 68,000, phosphorylase B 92,900, and B galactosidase 116,500. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using 125I labeled lysate of CEM TALL line . CBL1 bound to rabbit antimouse IgM proteinA Sepharose 4B beads was then immunoprecipitated with antibody 157 bound to protein A Chromatofocusing One milliliter of CBL1 ascites in 20ml 0.025M ethanol amine buffer was loaded on a lxl5cm column of 0Polybuffer Exchanger 94 Pharmacia . Proteins were eluted from the column according to their isoelectric points with polybuffer 96 at pH 6.0. When the column reached pH 6.0, 1.OM NaCl was used as an eluent to remove all remaining proteins. Fractions were collected during the elution and the pH and OD280nm of each fraction was measured.In order to determine which fractions contained the antibody activity, each fraction was tested for complement dependent cytotoxicity against blast cells and monocytes.CFU C test This test, involving the growth of normal bone marrow colonies in soft agar with and without treatment with antibodies and complement is described in Billing et al. 1980 Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol.16 202 210.Animals Young male or female Rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta from the California Primate Research Center were used. Initially, two monkeys suffering from endometriosis were used because of the unknown possibility that fatal side effects might occur. Later, healthy animals weighing between 5 and 6kg were used.Four animals were used as controls 10 were treated with anti Ia, and six with antiblast monocyte antibodies.Treatment of monkeys The ascites form of antibodies was given daily by intravenous injection in 5ml saline. Control monkeys received similar injections of saline. The quantities of ascites given to each monkey are mentioned in the Results section. The initial dose was given two days prior to skin grafting. Then the same dose was given daily except weekends until the graft was rejected. In some cases the dose was increased after the second day. A full thickness 4cm x 4cm skin graft was applied on the forearm which was put in a plaster cast and removed on the fifth postoperative day.Discoloration of the graft was taken as the endpoint for graft rejection.Monitoring The total and differential counts of peripheral white blood cells were done daily. The peripheralB cells were monitored daily be a rosetting technique using ox red blood cells coupled with the mouse H4 monoclonal antibody. Rosetted cells were counted on a hemocytometer and expressed as a percentage of total lymphocytes. Additionally, B cells were tested for indirect immunofluorescense using the H4 monoclonal antibody. Using this technique it was possible to define the dosage and the timing of antibody administration required to provide a reduction in peripheral blood Ia positive cells in treated monkeys. In the second experiment peripheral blood monocytes were counted daily. Blood serum was also examined by immunodiffusion to detect antimouse antibodies in these primates.None of the monkeys had detectable levels of these antibodies at any time during the administration of monoclonal antibody or following skin graft rejection. RESULTS The reactivity of monoclonal antibody CBL1 and heteroantiserum 157 was tested by cytotoxicity Table 1 against a panel of normal and leukemia cells.The general reactivity pattern of the two antibodies was similar but not identical. For example, both CBL1 and 157 reacted with leukemia blasts from the majority of AML, AMML, ALL, and CML in blast crisis. Leukemia cells from 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL and 3 hairy cell leukemia patients were negative. Eight of eight ALL cell lines and 6 6 PHA blast tested were positive to both CBL1 and 157. However, apart from monocytes, no other normal peripheral blood cells reacted with either CBL1 or 157.

There were some definite differences in reactivity of CBL1 and 157 against certain leukemia cells which remained consistent after several repeated testings Table 2 . In Table 2, AML cell 206371 is a representative cell which was clearly positive to both CBL1 and 157. Against this target cell the titer of CBL1 was 1 105 and the titer of 157 was 1 128. The other six cells listed in Table 2 showed discrepancies betweenCBL1 and 157. For example, human blast cells from five patients reacted with 157 but not with CBL1 and one AML cell, 223836, reacted with CBLI but not with 157.

TABLE 3 CYTOTOXICITY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY CBL1 AGAINST CFU C FROM NORMAL HUMAN BONE MARROW RecoveryAntibody Dilution CFU C 100 CBL1 1 100 0 CBL1 1 1000 0 CBL1 1 10,000 44 CBL1 was tested against isolated cells from solid tumors. Apart from a lung and papillary carcinoma, 22 different solid tumor cells were negative. These included cells from four breast, five lung, four colon, four rectum, two stomach, and three ovarian tumors. CBL1 as cites fluid was fractionated by chromatofocusing. One major cytotoxicity peak was eluted at a pH of 9.95 suggesting that the ascites contained only one cytotoxic antibody against the immunizing cell CEM . This antibody reacted with blast cells and monocytes and was identified as IgM by immunodiffusion. Fraction 26, which contained only 1 of the total cytotoxic reactivity, contained several subclasses of IgG, IgM, and IgA. The proteins in fraction 26 probably represent IgG1 from the X63 myeloma genes and also normal mouse proteins that are part of all myeloma ascites. The apparent molecular weights of the blast antigens detected by 157 and CBL1 were determined by immunoprecipitation of 1251 labeled cell surface antigens and SDS PAGE. Antiserum 157 immunoprecipitated an antigen of 180,000 daltons under nonreducing conditions that dissociated into a single polypeptide of 90,000 under reducing conditions. The antigen detected by CBL1 could not be 125 determined by I labeling and immunoprecipitation using the immunizing cell CEM T ALL line . When labeled cell surface antigens from CEM were immunoprecipitated with CBL1 and run on SDS PAGE, no labeled antigenic peaks were observed. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments with 157 and CBL1 were done.125I labeled lysate from CEM was cleared with CBL1 bound to Sepharose beads. Then the supernatant remaining was immunoprecipitated with antibody 157 bound to Sepharose beads. SDS PAGE of the bound antigen still showed 180,000 dalton peaks present after clearing the lysate with CBL1. This strongly indicated that the CBLI antibody was not removing, and thus not reacting with the 180,000 dalton antigen recognized by antiserum 157. Treatment with CBL1 as Immunosuppressant The cytotoxicity of CBL1 against normal cells was presented in Table 1. All monocytes and blast cells were positive titer 1 1 while normal nondividing cells were negative. Six Rhesus monkeys treated with CBL1 ascites received skin transplants which survived from 16 to 22 days Table 4 . No deaths or adverse side effects were seen following treatment with CBL1. Differential blood cell counts taken every other day did not show any significant changes in lymphocytes, granulocytes, platelets, or monocytes.

The H4 antibodies were also shown by immunoprecipitation to react with the Ia antigen p27,35. Hocking et al. 1981 , supra.

All these doses proved to be fatal and the animals died within hours of receiving the antibodies. The cause of death appeared to be directly related to the cytotoxic effect of the H4 ascites fluid, because a similar volume of ascitic fluid with a lower cytotoxic titer did not have any adverse effects on the primates. Thereafter there was only one death that occurred on the sixth postoperative day which was again attributable to administration of a higher dose of H4.The animals appeared to die from an anaphylactic type reaction, apparently resulting from the Ia specific reaction with mast cells which can release toxic levels of histamines. Meaningful skin transplant results were obtained from five monkeys treated with anti Ia. All of these were alive and well during the treatment. The four control animals rejected their grafts on the fifth or sixth days whereas the five anti Ia animals rejected between 13 and 19 days Table 6 . The number and percentage of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the Ia treated monkeys was reduced during treatment but invariably began to increase again towards the rejection time. Table 7 shows the blood counts of one representative monkey 7862 . Similar results were obtained with the other anti Ia treated monkeys. The number of B lymphocytes decreased from 1,011x103 mm3 before treatment to between 173 and 250x103 mm3 during treatment but began to increase to 330xl03 mm3 at rejection.Total WBC and platelet counts remained fairly constant during treatment TABLE 7 REPRESENTATIVE BLOOD CELL COUNTS IN AN ANIMAL TREATED WITH ANTI IA ANTIBODY H4 Pretreatment Days following skin graft with H4 Day 1 Day 4 Day 7 Day 12 Day 15WBC 103 mm3 7.2 8.1 5.4 6.0 5.7 5.8 Lympho 52 22 31 17 40 38 Platelets mm3 429,000 439,000 331,000 535,000 B cells of lymphocytes 27 13 11.8 17 11 2 14 Absolute count ofB cells mm3 1101 231 197 173 250 330 Graft rejected It is evident from the above results that the subject monoclonal antibodies are specific for a particular subpopulation of leukocytes including blast cells and monocytes. The antibodies may be used as immunosuppressive agents which prolong survival of transplants. Moreover, the antibodies promise fewer side effects than pancytotoxic drugs which have a broad spectrum suppressive effect on the immune system. In particular, by leaving the existing population of mature B cells and T cells intact to fight bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, the patients ability to survive is greatly enhanced. The use of monoclonal antibodies which further react with Ia antigen, as typified by H4, is contraindicated since such reactivity can be lethal. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced.
