# Apparatus for counteracting the cathode current increase occurring during warming up in a travelling wave tube in response to variation in the grid cathode distance.

## Abstract
Apparatus for compensating the injurious increase of the cathode current occurring during the initial operation perod of a travelling wave tube when, during successive warming up, the grid first approaches the cathode and then assumes the nominal distance therefrom. The apparatus includes a distance control device measuring the deviation between the actual grid cathode distance and the nominal distance and generating a control signal proportional to the deviation for reducing the value of the grid voltage.
