## Description
VAPOR FUEL SYSTEM FOR A N INTERNAL COtssUSTION ENGINE Background of the Invention The present invention relates generally to an internal combustion engine operable with an alcohol fuel and, specifically, to a fuel system for supplying a vaporized fuel to the engine. The term alcohol as used herein includes a variety of hydroxyl derivatives of hydrocarbons, such as, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tertiary butanol and mixtures thereof with or without water. Internal combustion engines operated with alcohol or a blended gasoline alcohol mixture have been in use for many years. Such blending, however, lowers the boiling point of the gasoline and thereby causes vapor lock in the fuel pump at a lower temperature than would be the case with pure gasoline. In addition, the introduction of water to a blended gasoline alcohol fuel mixture causes the mixture to separate into its constituent phases. Since the resultant fuel supplied to the carburetor is not of constant composition and does not correspond to the composition to which the carburetor was initially adjusted, the engine malfunctions. Thus, the need exists for a fuel system which, in addition to overcoming the cold starting difficulties of an alcohol fueled engine, can operate with either gasoline, oropane or alcohol. However, another problem exists. The use of a conventional carburetor often leads to inefficient combustion with unburned fuel passing through the exhaust manifold to the atmosphere. This inefficient combustion is evidenced by an increase in hydrocarbon emissions. As an alternative, the fuel can be injected.A fuel injected system introduces small droplets of fuel into an air stream for passage to a cylinder. The injection inlets usually ave an inside diameter 1.27cm of at least 0.050 inches Although a fuel injected system is more efficient than a conventional carburetor, the injection of such large fuel droplets also results in incomplete combustion. In an ideal fuel system, the size of each droplet would approach that of a single molecule of fuel. If each fuel molecule could be surrounded by air, complete combustion would be possible. This would result in greater engine efficiency and power output as well as the possible elimination of all emissions other than carbon dioxide and water. By removing the carburetor and vaporizing the alcohol fuel, the present invention produces almost complete fuel combustion. In addition, any dependence on gasoline to overcome the cold starting difficulties normally associated with alcohol fueled engines is eliminated. Summary of the Invention The invention provides means for reducing the dependence of an internal combustion engine on hydrocarbon fuels derived from crude oil. Specifically, the present invention provides a fuel system which supplies alcohol vapors to an engine and produces nearly complete combustion. Electrical means is provided to heat and vaporize the alcohol fuel prior to ignition and thus avoid the cold starting problems associated with the use of alcohol as fuel. In addition, means are provided to heat the alcohol prior to combustion using thermal energy generated by the engine under normal operating conditions. The method according to the present invention comprises the steps of conveying the alcohol to a heat exchanging device in which is incorporated an electric heating element, and transferring heat from the electric heating element or the heated engine coolant to the alcohol. The heated alcohol flows through a conduit from the heat exchanger to a vaporization chamber which contains a second electric heating element. In the chamber the alcohol is heated to its boiling point. The alcohol vapors produced upop.boiling are then passed directly to the intake manifold of the engine. All components of the fuel system through which the heated alcohol and alcohol vapor flow are insulated to minimize heat loss. An additional heat exchanging device located on the exhaust line heats a solution of 5 50 alcohol in water to boiling. As a result, the vapor content and temperature of the air passing to the intake manifold is increased, and steam is created to maintain the alcohol that flows from the vaporization chamber in the gaseous state. It is an object of this invention to increase the efficiency of an alcohol operated internal combustion engine by providing means for vaporizing the alcohol fuel as well as means for heating and humidifying the air used in combustion. It is a further object of this invention to provide a means for overcoming the cold starting problems of an internal combustion engine operated with alcohol as fuel. Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description made with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a vaporization chamber which heats and vaporizes the alcohol fuel prior to combustion. Figure 4 is a side elevational view of an exhaust gas heat exchanging unit. Figure 5 is a sectional view taken along the line 5 5 of Figure 4. Detailed Description of the Invention As illustrated in Figure 1, fuel is stored in a tank 10 and is drawn therefrom via conduit 12 under pressure produced by a fuel pump 14. The fuel may be selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tertiary butanol or mixtures thereof with or without water. The alcohol fuel flows through the conduit 12 to a heat exchanger 16 at a pressure of anproximately two pounds per square inch. The heat exchanger 16, best shown in Figure 2, is a hollow cylinder having a liquid coolant inlet 18 and outlet 20 plus a fuel inlet 22 and outlet 24. Liquid coolant from the internal combustion engine 26 is circulated by a water pump 28 through a hose 30 to the coolant inlet 18. The coolant circulates through the heat exchanger 16 and, via coolant outlet 20, returns to the engine 26 through a hose 32. Fuel flows from conduit 12 to the fuel inlet 22 of the heat exchanger and through a tube 34 located within heat exchanger 16. Tube 34 is connected to the fuel outlet 24. A conduit 36 communicates the fuel outlet 24 of the heat exchanger 16 with an inlet 38 of a vaporization chamber 40. An elongated, rod like electric heating element 42 is located within the heat exchanger 16, tube 34 being concentrically disposed about the heat ing element. The electric heating element supplements the heat from the engine to overcome the cold starting difficulties associated with use of alcohol fuel. A thermostat 44 located between the heat exchanger 16 and the vaporization chamber 40 controls the electric heating element 42. Electric heating element 42 is operated by power supply 47, which may be the vehicle s battery. The heated alcohol flows from the heat exchanger 16 through conduit 36 to the inlet 38 of the vaporization chamber 40. As illustrated in Figure 3, the vaporization chamber 40 has an outlet 48 in addition to the inlet 38. The level of fluid in the vaporization chamber 40is regulated by a valve 50 and a float 52. Electric heating element 54 located below the fluid level within the vaporization chamber 40 further heats the alcohol to boiling. A thermostat 53 located between the chamber 40 and the intake manifold 58 controls the electric heating element 54 and a ready light 55. The ready light indicates when the alcohol fuel is vaporized so that the engine can be started. The alcohol vapors produced flow through the outlet 48 to a conduit 56 which is connected to the intake manifold 58 of the engine 26. A butterfly valve 60 controls the volume of alcohol vapor which flows to the manifold. A safety valve 62 opens to release alcohol vapor if the pressure within the vaporization chamber 40 exceeds a predetermined value. Referring again to Figure 1, a conduit 64 communicates a tank 66 with an exhaust gas heat exchanger 68. The alcohol water solution contained in the tank 66 flows by gravity to the exhaust gas heat exchanger 68. The freezing of the alcohol water solution at low temperatures is prevented by increasing the alcohol concentration within the range of 5 to 50 by volume to depress the freezing point of the solution. As further shown in Figure 1, the exhaust gas heat exchanger 68 is a hollow cylinder comprised, in part, of exhaust gas inlet 70, exhaust gas outlet 72, air inlet 74 and air outlet 76. Exhaust gas inlet 70 is connected via exhaust pipe 78 with the exhaust manifold 80 of the engine 26. The air outlet 76 is connected via a hose 82 with the intake manifold 58 of the engine 26. Exhaust gas outlet 72 and air inlet 74 are in communication with the atmosphere. Referring now to Figure 4, the exhaust gas inlet 70 is connected to exhaust gas outlet 72 by a plurality of heat transfer tubes, generally designated by the numeral 82. Surrounding the heat transfer tubes is a solution of 5 50 alcohol in water from tank 66. The alcohol solution enters the heat exchanger 68 through an inlet 86. The level of the fluid in heat exchanger 68 is regulated by a valve 88 and a float 90. Hot exhaust gases are used to heat the alcohol water solution in heat exchanger 68 to boiling. The gases are admitted at exhaust gas inlet 70, are passed through heat transfer tubes 84 and are released as cooled gases to the ambient atmosphere through exhaust gas outlet 72. Since the exhaust gases pass through a series of tubes, rather than through a single heat transfer tube, the surface area of the tubes in contact with the surrounding fluid is increased and maximum heat transfer from the gases passing through tubes 84 to the alcohol water solution results. Incoming air through the air inlet 74 is deflected toward the surface of the boiling solution by a baffle 92. Thereafter, the air passes over the surface of the boiling solution, absorbs moisture and passes through the air outlet 76 to flow through hose 82 to the intake manifold 58. T he operation of the invention is as follows.Thermostat 44, which controls electric heating element 42, is adjusted to a temperature slightly less than the boiling point of the alcohol uset.65sr example, the boiling poit3omethanol is 1490F. and that of ethanol is 173 F. The heated alcohol flows through conduit 36 to the vaporization chamber 40. Thermostat 53, which controls electric heating element 54, is adjusted to 2 temperature slightly greater than the boiling point of the alcohol used. IQhen the alcohol reaches its boiling point, the light 55 illuminates to indicate that the engine may be started. The volume of alcohol vapor that flows from the vaporization chamber 40 and the intake manifold 58 can be manually controlled by the operator. As indicated, each thermostat is adjustable. Thus, the fuel system is capable of using alcohols with different boiling points. In addition, the system can adapt to ambient temperature changes and pressure changes due to variations in altitude. A able within the range of 140, and 220 F is suitable for this purpose. When the engine reaches its normal operating temperature and the engine coolant is heated sufficiently, a thermostatic valve 94 opens to allow the flow of heated engine coolant from the radiator 96 through heat exchanger 16. The heated coolant supplements the electric heating element 42 to heat the alcohol fuel. The incoming air to the carburetor used in combustion is heated and humidified in the following manner. Tank 66 gravity feeds a solution of 5 50 alcohol in water to exhaust gas heat exchanger 68.The exhaust gases passing through exhaust pipe 78 heat the alcohol water solution to boiling. As the incoming, air passes over the boiling solution, the air is heated and becomes saturated with alcohol and water. The humidified air passes through air outlet 76 to the intake manifold 58 which is in communication with the cylinders of engine 26. The heated air aids in the vaporization of the alcohol fuel. The additional moisture creates steam in the engine cylinder which results in a higher internal pressure than in the case of a heated dry gas due to the steam water volumetric expansion ratio of 1800 1. A dry gas, on the other hand, only expands in direct proportion to its absolute temterature. A suitable corrosion inhibitor may be added to the fuel system to inhibit the corrosive effects of the water present. Alternatively, suitable corrosion resistant materials may be utilized in the fabrication of the system. As an additional advantage of the invention, greater expansive forces are realized upon combustion due to the presence of steam in the engine cylinders at elevated temperatures. The addition of water in the form of steam to the system may have the additional advantage of reducing the generation of emissions because the cooling effect of the condensed water lowers the combustion temperature thereby reducing nitrogen oxide production which is temperaturetime dependent. It will be understood that various changes and modifications may be made in the above described apparatus without departing from the spirit thereof, particularly as defined in the following claims.
