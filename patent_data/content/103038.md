## Description
Continuous skin, variable camber airfoil edge actuating mechanism. The present invention relates generally to contin ous skin, variable camber airfoils, and, more particularly, to improved actuating mechanisms for such variable camber airfoils which are characterized by their simplicity, rigidity and stability, yet which permit attainment of optimized aerodynamic airfoil configurations and or reconfigur, ons. without compromising structural wing box design and or plcement, withour requiring the continuous flexible skin to f unction as a load carrying member, without the need for actuating members to project out of the desired opti mized aerodynamic contour of the airfoil, and without the need for separate flaps and or other structures which tend to produce discontinuities in the upper continuous skin surface of the airfoil. The Government has rights in this invention nur suant to Contract No. F33615 78 C 3027 awarded by theUnited States Air Force. In the design of airfoils especially in light of today s highly advanced state of aircraft technology many differing, and sometimes conflicting, design considerations must be taken into account such, merely by way of example, , as the operating conditions to which the aircraft is to be subjected e.g., subsonic, transonic and or supersonic flight conditions. Each different set of operating conditions presents its own special and, ofttimes, unique problems in terms of desired and or required airfoil performance characteristics.However, common to the problems of efficient and effective airfoil design is the continuing need to design improved actuating mechanisms for varying camber of the airfoil or, at least, of a portion of the airfoil i.e., the leading and or trailing edge s of the airfoil in a smooth, efficient manner so as not to induce flow separation at localized regions on the surface of the airfoil, yet wherein the variable camber portion of the airfoil can be readily deployed to any desired operating position. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that most conventional airfoil designs in use today irrespective of whether intended for aircraft having subsonic, transonic and or supersonic capability, and or whether the aircraft is intended for commercial or other types of usage require a rigid structural wing box which generally occupies at least 40 of the chord wise dimension of the airfoil such wing box serving to provide structural rigidity for the airfoil, primary structural frame members for attachment of leading edges, trailing edges and or ailerons, as well as storage space for fuel. However, since trailing edge flaps, ailerons and actuating members therefore also commonly require 40 of the chord wise dimension of the airfoil, this leaves only on the order of 20 , or less, of the airfoil s chord wise dimension to accomodate leading edge flaps and actuating mechanisms.These conflicting demands for space have, prior to the advent of the present invention, mandated compromise on the part of the designer i.e., a specific airfoil design has generally been required for each differing specific operational condition. That is, for example, high lift, low speed performance characteristics are required, separate flaps are commonly provided which, unfortunately, inherently result in skin surface discontinuities that deleteriously affect airfoil performance and which require complex actuating mechanisms.Alternatively,If separate flaps cannot be tolerated, the designer is forced to make some other compromise such, for example, as limiting the degree of permissible flap deflection, permitting actuating members to project out of the optimum airfoil contour, and or permitting the actuating mechanism to penetrate into the critical area desirably reserved for the rigid structural wing box. The present invention obviates the need for such compromises. From the standpoint of design and or operating desideratum, a number of points are of promary interest.These include, for example, a variable camber system wherein i the actuating mechanism is compatible with a wide range of airfoil designs and does not denigrate or otherwise compromise such requisite structural considerations as wing box location and or extent ii the actuating mechanism is capable of providing a rigid airfoil structure at each different operating position and wherein load paths are maintained both simple and short iii the variable cambe control linkage mechanism is table at all operating positions an essentially derives no strength from the skin that is, wherein the airfoil skin does not serve as a load carrying element iv the actuating linkage permits both positive up and negative down deflection through a maximum range of desired rotational angles while maintaining a smoortly continuous skin surface having a relatively constant curvature consistent with desired aerodynamic contours and v the actuating linkage is equally applicable for usage in either or both of variable camber leading airfoil edges and or trailing edges. Many attempts have been made in the past to provide variable camber airfoil surfaces which meet certain selected design requirements and operational parameters.Such prior art attempts have involved many different approaches and have met with varying degrees of success.An early typical approach involved the use of slip joints 1 and or similar overlapping skin surfaces having the ability to grow and or shrink as the degree of airfoil camber is increased and decreased. However, the design of such systems has commonly required the elimination of, or significant alteration of, the airfoil wing box. Because rigid wing box designs are eliminated or significantly altered, poor structural load paths result and, often, the skin itself has been required to function as a load carrying element. Moreover, in such systems undesired flow separation is commonly produced at the skin surface discontinuities in the regions of the slip joints or other overlapping flap arrangements. As a result of such limitations, this type of apparatus has generally been limited to usage where the airfoil need only operate in low dynamic pressure regions. Typical prior art approaches involving slip joints or other overlapping flap constructions wherein the skin surface of the airfoil is characterized by one or more surface discontinuities are illustred in, for example, British Provisional Pat.No. 103,400, January 25,1917 a slip joint arrangement and actuating linkage for use in trailing edges U.S.Pat.No. 1,567,531 Magni a discontinuous lap joint and actuating linkage for varying camber throughout all or selected portions of the chord wise dimension of an air foil , U.S.Pat.No. 1,868,748 Hogan a discontinuous lap joint and actuating linkage for leading and or trailing edges U.S.Pat.No. 3,179,357 Lyon a slip joint and actuating linkage for trailing edges and U.S.Pat.No.4,0123 Ball et al a slip joint and actuating linkage for an inlet ramp on supersonic aircraft . Other types of mechanisms disclosed in the prior art for varying camber along all or a substantial portion of the chord length of the airfoil are disclosed in U.S.Pat.Nos. 1,828,981 Parker, 1,886,362 Antonl, 2,022,806 Grant, and 3,716,209 Pierce. In general, all of the foregoing proposed constructions result in one or more of i flow separation at localized areas of skin surface discontinuities, ii elimination or substantial reduction of the structural airfoil wing box with consequent denigration of structural load paths, iii , lack of rigidity and stability in the actuating mechanism, iv a requirement that the skin of the airfoil function as a load carrying element, and or v , excessive undesired skin flutter which severely alters the performance characteristics of the airfoil. As a consequence, this type of construction has generally been limited to airfoils used in low dynamic pressure regions. Another proposed solution to the problems inherent with variable camber airfoils has required the use of separate flaps such, for example, as the use of Krueger flaps at an airfoil leading edge in the manner disclosed inU.S.Pat.No. 3,504,870 Cole. Again, this type of construction is characterized by discontinuities in the upper skin surface of the airfoil which characteristically produce flow separation and, further, is not suitable for cruise camber control but, rather, is limited to usage as a low speed, high lift device of the type commonly employed in take off and or landing operational modes. Efforts to overcome the problems associated with discontinuities in the upper skin surface have contemplated the usage of variable camber leading and or trailing edges wherein the airfoil employs a flexible skin which is subjected to rather sharp deflection in a highly localized region such, for example, as the arrangement disclosed inU.S.Pat.Nos. 1,763,888 Griswold, II, and 2,749,060 Brady et al. See, also, U.S.Pat.No. 2,650,047 Carhart et al. Because of the relatively sharp skin deflection in a localized region, such attempts have failed to solve the problem of flow separation i.e., the sharp localized deflection area, although a continuous skin surface, still functions as a significant curvature discontinuity which produces flow separation.Moreover, in such constructions the airfoil skin is subjected to significant stress and, this fact places severe constraints on the degree of deflection permitted. Other types of variable camber systems employing continuous upper skin surfaces are those disclosedin, for example U.S.Pat.Nos. 2,763,448 Davie,Jr. 3,836,099 O Neill et al 3,994,451 Cole 3,994,452 Cole and 4,053,124 Cole.These types of camber control arrangements commonly employ relatively complex linkages or, linkage mechanisms which project out of the aerodynamic contour of the airfoil. Moreover, they provide only limited camber control, generally do not permit of positive up flap control and, commonly violate wing box integrity, As a result of these problems, aircraft employing such control mechanisms are commonly limited to operation in low dynamic pressure regions. Perhaps the mostrelevant of the prior art proposals of which the inventor and the inventor s assignee are presently aware are those disclosures in Zapel U.S.Pat.Nos. 4,131,253 and 4,171,787, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, which respectively disclose continuous flexible skin variable camber arrangements for airfoil trailing edges and airfoil leading edges. In these patent disclosures, while the flexible airfoil skin assumes a relatively constant smooth curvature devoid of interruptions throughout the region of airfoil deflection, the arrangements fail to obviate some of the more perplexing problems in variable camber airfoil design.Thus, the upper flexible skin surface is unsupported in all but the position of maximum deflection, thereby resulting in undesired skin flutter only limited deflection is obtained .g. in the range of up to 150 to 160 negative deflection for either a leading edge U.S.Pat.No. 4,171,787 or a trailing edge U.S.Pat.No. 4,131,253 the actuating linkage mechanism disclosed requires the use of cam grooves and followers which, because of their requisite and inherent loose fits , produce undesired flap flutter or chatter in addition to, and distinct from, the problem of skin flutter discussed above and, such actuating linkages tend to impinge upon wing box integrity, particularly in the regions of the cam rollers, followers and slideways which project into the regions where the leading and trailing spars of a wing box are desirably located. Moreover, the number of individual links required and the arrangements for pivotally interconnecting such links tends to increase the length and complexity of load paths. Because of the foregoing disadvantages, variable camber trailing and or leading edges of the types disclosed in the aforesaidZapel patents are generally limited to usage in relatively low speed operating modes. Accordingly, it is general aim of the present invention to provide an improved actuating mechanism suitable for use with continuous skin variable camber airfoils which overcomes the foregoing disadvantages inherent in conventional prior art variable camber control mechanisms and which permits changing airfoil contours to obtain optimum aerodynamic performance from a wide variety of different types of aircraft at various combinations of air speed, altitude and angles of attack.More specifically, the invention has as one of its principle objectives the provision of continuous skin variable camber control mechanisms characterized by their versatility and adaptability to virtually any airfoil design and which permit of optimal deflection of the variable camber portion of the airfoil through maximum operating ranges so as to enable the airfoil to be configured or, indeed, rapidly reconfigured in flight, to obtain. optimum acrodynamic performance c n lrac teristics for operation at subsonic, transonic and or supersonic operating modes. As a result of attaining these objectives, substantial improvements can be achieved in terms of payload ranges, maneuverability, and quality of ride. A further general objective of the invention is the provision of an improved, simple, yet highly efficient control actuating mechanism for variable camber airfoils which permits varying the camber of continuous skin airfoils through a relatively wide range of deflection angles, including both positive up and negative down deflection angles yet, wherein the degree of curvature of the deflect ed flexible skin surface remains substantially constant throughout the region of deflection for any given deflection angle, thereby insuring smooth, uniform uninterrupted airflow over the contour of the airfoil and attainment of optimized aerodynamic efficiencies and characteristics over a wide range of operating speeds and conditions.In this connection, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved variable camber system which permits optimization of both airfoil edge deflection and upper skin curvature to meet a wide range of desired aerodynamic configurations. It is a more specific, but highly important, objective of the invention to provide an improved actuating mechanism for varying the camber of continuous skin airfoils through a relatively wide range of deflection angles characterized by its simplicity, compactness, rigidity, stc illty and reliability, and which permits of freedom or aircraft oepration in virtually all conceivable dynamic pressure regions. In one of its more detailed aspects, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved actuating mechanism for a continuous skin variable camber airfoil which permits deployment of leading and or trailing edges to any desired position yet, which provides positive skin support and remains rigid and stable at all operating positions, thereby insuring eiimlnation of skin and or flap flutter which tend to reduce aerodynamic performance characteristics. Another objective of the invention is to provide an improved actuating mechanism for continuous skin variable camber airfoils which is characterized by short, simple load paths between the deflectable edge structure and the main airfoil support frame, and wherein the airfoil skin is not required to function as a load carrying element and is not subjected to apperciable chord wise stress resulting from motion of the actuating linkage. In one of its more important aspects, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved actuating mechanism for variable camber airfoils which is, because of its compact, rigid, stable actuating linkage, compatible with virtually any conventional airfoil design and can be readily adapted to the structural wing box of such airfoils withour requiring either modification or displacement of the structural wing box and without impinging on the critical space generally reserved for the wing box. A detailed objective of the invention is the provision of an improved actuating mechanism for continous skin variable camber airfoils which permits attainment of optimum deflection characteristics i.e., leading edge negative down deflections up to on the order of 23 , trailing edge negative down deflections up to on the order of 320, leading edge positive up deflections of up to on the order of 30, and trailing edge positive up 0 deflection of up to on the order of 6 yet wherein relatively constant curvature of the smooth, continuous, uninterrupted skin is maintained throughout the area of deflection at each given desired operating position.Indeed, when used in connection with a variable camber leading edge, achievabie deflection angles utilizing the linkage of the present invention are sufficiently great that separate lift flaps e.g., tvrueger flaps are no longer required, thereby eliminating the need for separate high lift systems from wings requiring good low speed aerodynamic characteristics. Yet another objective of the invention is to provide an improved actuating mechanism for continuous skin variable camber airfoils which greatly improves the versatility of the aircraft and which finds equally advantageous use with low speed flaps high lift devices or high speed ailerons used for roll control since the system has positive up deflection capability. A further objective of the invention is the provision of a continuous skin variable camber airfoil actuating mechanism which, because of its simple, positive force transmitting linkage arrangement, permits of rapid response times for desired changes in airfoil configurations, thus permitting enhanced maneuverability as required with high performance aircraft. A somewhat more detailed objective of the invention is the provision of a simple, compact and reliable actuating mechanism for continuous skin variable camber airfoils which permits of ease of mechanization from conventional materials, and wherein the linkage arrangements employed are subtantial ly identical irrespective of whether incorporated in the airfoil leading edge, the trailing edge, or both edges, thereby simplifying airfoil design, installation and maintenance. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the attached drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a typical high performance aircraft with which the present invention finds particularly advantageous, but by no means exclusive, use Figure 2 is a fragmentary plan view of a portion of the main airfoil of the aircraft depicted in Fig.1 Figure 3 is a highly diagrammatic sectional view taken substantially along the line 3 3 in Fig. 2, here depicting the optimal locations for the leading and trailing spars or structural frame members in a conventional rigid structural wing box and depicting alsor in general terms, the relative percentages of chordal areas generally reserved ij for the centralrigid structural wing box, ii the trailing edge deflectable control flaps, ailerons and actuating linkages, and iii leading edge deflectable flaps and actuating mechanisms Figure 4 is a sectional view of a forward variable camber section of a flexible continuous skin airfoil employing an actuating mechanism in accordance with the present invention, with the sectional view here taken transverse to the span wise axis of the airfoil, and showing the airfoil in its cruise or uncambered position Figure 5 is a highly simplified, diagrammatic line drawing here particularly illustrating in composite form the two 4 bar linkage mechanisms utilized with the present invention for deflecting the leading edge of an airfoil Figure 6 is a view similar to figure 5, but here illustrating only the 4 bar linkage mechanism utilized to control horizontal and vertical displacement of the airfoil structural edge member Figure 7 is a view similar to figure 6, but here illustrating the 4 bar linkage arrangement utilized for controlling angular rotation of the leading edge and for controlling the moment applied to the end of the upper flexible skin Figure 8 is a sectional view similar to figure 4, but, here depicting the leading edge of the airfoil at an intermediate negative down deflected position Figure 9 is a vertical sectional view similar to figures 4 and 8, but here depicting the leading edge of the airfoil in its fully deflected position defining an included angle with the wing chord reference plane of on the order of 230 Figure 10 is a sectional view similar to figure 4, but here illustrating the leading edge upon positive up deflection and defining an included angle with the wing chord reference plane on the order of 30 Figure 11 is a framentary vertical plan view of the actuating linkage of the present invention, here depicting the links interconnected to the main structural frame members of the wing box, but with the airfoil skin removed for purposes of clarity, and Figures 12 and 13 are sectional views similar to figures 4 and 9, respectively, but here illustrating the actuating mechanism of the present invention as incorporated in a variable camber continuous skin trailing edge with the trailing edge being illustrated in the cruise position fig.12 and in the position of maximum negative down deflection defining an included angle on the order of 320 with the wing chord reference plane figure 13 . While the invention is susceptible of various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that it is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but, on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. Referring first to figure 1, there has been diagrammatically illustrated a conventional high performance aircraft, generally indicated at 20, having i a main wing or airfoil 21 comprosing a variable camber airfoil embodying features of the present invention and ii a conventional rudder and stabilizer assembly, generally indicated at 22.As here sho, the exemplary variable camber airfoil 21 includes a single segment variable camber leading edge 24 and a three segment variable camber trailing edge 25 having three deployable flaps 26, 27 and 28. However, as the ensuing description proceeds, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited to the number of deployable edges 24,25 but, rather, finds equally advantageous use with either single segment or multiple segment edges on either or both of the leading and trailing edges 24,25 of the airfoil 21.Moreover, although the invention has, for purposes of understanding, here been illustrated as incorporated in a high performance aircraft capable of speeds ranging up to and into supersonic ranges, it is equally applicable to other types of aircraft including, for example, commercial and or private aircraft capable of operating at any desired speeds within the subsonic, transonic and or supersonic ranges. In the design of variable camber airfoils for such aircraft and, as best illustrated by reference to figs.2 and 3 conjointly, it is desirable that provision be made for varying the camber of the airfoil in response to pilot commands and or changes in flight conditions. In general, this can be accomplished by providing a variable camber leading edge capable of being deployed both downwardly negative deflection and upwardly positive deflection , as indicated by the broken line positions in Figure 3 for the leading edge 24. This may also be accomplished by providing a variable camber trailing edge, either in lieu of or in addition to the variable camber leading edge such variable camber trailing edge also being deployable both downwardly negative deflection and upwardly positive deflection , as indicated by the broken line positions depicted in figure 3.However, in order to achieve the desired deflection angles, the variable camber portion s of the airfoil 21 whether either or both of the leading and or trailing edges have, as heretofore indicated, generally required separate flaps, discontinuous upper skin surfaces, complex actuating linkage assemblies, and or actuating linkage assemblies which project out of the airfoil s aerodynamic contour and or which impinge on and, consequently, result in reduction in the size of, modification of, and or elimination of, the structural wing box commonly employed within the airfoil. For example, referring to figure 3, there has been diagrammatically illustrated a typical multi purpose variable camber airfoil 21 having a chord length CL and a centrally located structural wing box WB defined by leading and trailing main frame structural spars, diagram,matically illustrated at 32 and 32 , respectively such wing box WB extending along the full span wise dimension of the airfoil 21. As a general rule, the wing box WB desirably occupies at least the central 40 of the airfoil s chordal dimensionCL. Similarly, the trailing edge flaps, ailerons, and actuating mechanisms therefore, commonly require the trailing 40 of the airfoil chordal dimension CL viz. the 40 of the airfoil disposed rearwardly of the rearmost wing box spar 32 .As a consequence, the deployable leading edge of the variable camber airfoil 21, together with its actuating mechanism, is generally limited to use of only the leading 20 , or less, of the airfoil s chordal dimension CL viz., to that portion of the airfoil forward of the forwardmost wing box spar 32. Because of these severe space limitations, prior to the advent of the present invention, airfoil designers were generally forced to make unwanted compromises in design parameters in order to meet specific operational needs.The present invention obviates the need to make such compromises and permits both positive up and negative down deflection of either or both of the leading and trailing edges 24, 25 of the airfoil 21 through deflection angles equal to and or greater than heretofore obtainable yet, permits achievement of these results without impingement upon the space desirably reserved to accomodate the structural wing box E Thus, in accordance with one of the important aspects of the present invention and, as best illustrated by reference to figure 4, there has been provided an improved actuating mechanism, generally indicated at 29, for permit ting both controlled positive and controlled negatieve deployment of a span wise structural edge member 30 which, for purposes of eXdmp ve, here takes the form of the span wise structural edge member 30 for the leading edge 24 of the airfoil 21 to any selected angular position within a relatively wide range of desired rotational angles, and, which is characterized by i its stability and rigidity in all operating positions, ii its ability to provide load bearing support at all operative positions without requiring the upper airfoil skin to function as a load bearing element, and iii its compactness, thereby permitting the actuating mechanism 29 to be contained entirely within the aerodynamic contour of the airfoil 21, yet without requiring elimination, modification and or displacement of the conventional airfoil structural wing box WB and without impinging upon the space desirably reserved for such wing box. To accomplish this, the present invention contemplates the use of two 4 bar linkage assemblies one 4 bar linkage assembly to control horizontal and vertical displacement of the structural edge member 30 as it is deployed, and a second 4 bar linkage assembly to control i the angular rotation of the structural edge member 30 during deployment and ii , the moment applied to the flexible continuous upper skin 31 in the variable camber portion of the airfoil. To permit controlled vertical and horizontal displacement of the structural edge member 30 and, as will best be understood by reference to figures 4 and 5 conjointly fig.5 comprises a simplified line diagram of the actuating control links employed , the first 4 bar linkage assembly includes a first generally horizontal control link L1 pivotally connected at its forward end to the lower inboard edge of structural edge member 30 at point P1, a pair of generally upright control links L2 and L3 pivotally connected at points P2 and P3, respectively, to the structural main frame MF which here projects forwardly from the leading edge, diagrammatically indicated at 32, of the structural wing box WB and, the forward projecting portion of the main frame t1F. In carrying out the invention, the lower end of link L2 is pivotally connected to the inboard end of link L1 at point P1 2i while the lower end of link L3 is pivotally connected to link L1 at point P1,3 intermediate the ends of link L1 i.e. intermediate points P1 and P1 2. The second 4 bar linkage assembly for controlling angular rotation of the structural edge member 30 during deployment comprises control link L1 and control links L4,L5 andL6. As here shown, control link L4 comprises a relatively short, generally horizontal link pivotally connected at one end to control link L1 at point P1,2, with its opposite end extending towards, and terminating short of, the pointP1,3 of pivotal connection between links L1 and L3.Control link L5 comprises a short, generally upright, link pivotally connected at its upper end to the main frame MF at point P3 and pivotally connected at its lower end to the forward end of link L4, as indicated at P4 5. Control link L6 is pivotally connected at point P6 to the upper inboard edge of structural edge member 30, and extends rearwardly therefrom, havings its opposite end pivotally connected to control link L5 at point P5,6 intermediate points P3 and P4 5. To facilitate and understanding of the operation of the control actuating linkage assemblies, reference is first made to Fig.6 wherein the airfoil 21 is diagrammatically illustrated for purposes of clarity with only the 4 bar linkage assembly for controlling vertical and horizontal displacement of the structural edge member 30 viz. links and and L3 and main frame MF.Thus, as here shown, it will 1 L 2 be observed that as link L2 is pivoted about point P2 by any suitable means not shown such, for example, as a rotary actuator having an output shaft passing through point P2 and connected to link L2 which would then function as a torque arm or, a linear actuator coupled to links L1,L2 at point P1,2 pivotal connection P1,2 moves along a circular path 34.Similarly, point P1 3 also moves along a circular path 35 about pivot point P3. Rs a consequence of the foregoing motions, and the differing lengths of links L2 and L3, point P1 co t rlslnq the pivotal connection between control link L1 and structural edge member 30 moves along a noncircular curvilinear path 36.Thus, with links L1 L3 and structural edge member 30 in the positions shown viz., the cruise camber position and, assuming that link L2 is pivoted in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in the drawing, point P1 2 moves to the right to the position P1 2i point P1 3 moves to position P1 3 and, the structural edge member 30 is displaced downwardly and rearwardly so as to shift point P1 to the position indicated at P1,. Turning now to Fig.7, the motions associated with the 4 bar linkage assembly for controlling angular rotation of structural edge meber 30 have been diagrammatically illustrated and, while links L2 and L3 are not reproduced for purposes of clarity, the paths of movement 34, 36 for points P112 and P1 ,respectively , have been shown. Thus, it will be appreciated that as link L1 and its inboard pivot point P1 2 move along circular path 34, the pivotal connection P4 5 between the links L4 and L5 moves along a circular path 38, while the pivotal connection Pug,6 between links L5 and L6 moves along a circular path 39.Since the outboard end of control link L6 is pivotally connected at point P6 to structural edge member 30 and, since point P6 is fixed relative to point P1, movement of link L1 and its pivot point P1 2 to position P1 2 as previously described is 1,2 1,2 accompanied by corresponding circular movement of points P4,5 and P5,6 to positions P4 5 and P5,6,, respectively.As result, pivot point P between structural edge member 6 30 and link L moves along the curvilinear path 40 to point 6 P6 Similarly, clockwise movement of point P1 2 along path 34 causes corresponding clockwise roation of links L3 fig.6 and L5 about pivot P3, thereby causing points P1 and P6 to move upwardly and to the left to positions P1 and P61,, respectively. As a result of the foregoing movement, structural edge member 30 moves from the solid line position shown in fig.7 downwardly and to the right during negative de flection as indicated at tile positions shown fragmentarily at 30a, 30b and 30c.During positive up deflection, structural edge member 30 moves upwardly and to the left from the solid line cruise camber position to the position shown fragmentariiy at 30d. With the foregoing description of the motions of the actuating mechanism 29 in mind and, upon reference to fig.4, it will be noted that the upper flexible skin 31 of the airfoil 21 is supported at the midpoint of its chordal dimension by means of a support link L7 pivotally connected at its lower end to the central portion of linkL6 and its upper end to a bracker 41 rigidly secured to the inner surface of flexible skin 31.The arrangement is such that during deflection of the variable camber leading edge portion of the airfoil, the chord wise mid point of the flexible upper skin is maintained in a stable position of controlled constant curvature throughout its chord wise length by support link L7 which is interconnected directly to the actuating linkage assembly 29, with the latter and, espe ially, links L1 and L3 providing load bearing support for the structural edge member 30 i.e., the skin 31 provides no load bearing support. Of course, although the curvature of the flexible skin portion is maintained constant over is chord wise length for any given deflection angle, the degree of curvature varies dependent upon the actual deflection angle. Not only does suort link L7 insure that proper constant curvature is maintained for given angular deflections but, in addition, the support link imparts sufficient structural stability to the flexible skin 31 as to effectively preclude skin flutter in all operative positions of the airfoil.Thus, the upper skin surface of the airfoil 21 is characterized, at all operative positions of the variable camber surface, by a smooth, uninterrupted, continuous surface completely devoid of both surface discontinulties i.e., relatively sliding flaps,etc. and curvature discontinuities i.e., highly localized deflection areas. In carrying out the present invention, the continuous flexible upper skin 31 is wrapped around and secured to the structural edge member 30, terminating at a point 42 just below and slightly forward of the point P1 of pivotal connection between control link L1 and structural edge member 30. The lowermost airfoil skin surface in the variable camber region of the airfoil 21 preferably comprises a generally rigid panel 44 secured to the lower surfaces of the control links L1 for movement therewith such rigid panel 44 having an upwardly curved forward portion 45 dimensioned to provide a smooth, relatively slidable, interface with the edge 42 of the flexible skin 31 at all angular positions of the variable camber edge.Rigid panel 44 is provided with a rigid flap 46 hingedly connected thereto in a span wise direction as indicated at 48, and extending rearwardly beneath the skin surface 49 under the centrally disposed structural wing box portion of the airfoil 21 with the skin flap 46 and skin 49 defining a closely interfitting, slidable, lap joint, generally indicated at 50. To insure proper positioning of flap 46 relative to skin surface 49, the hinged connection 48 is preferably a conventional spring loaded hinge arrangement tending to bias flap 46 into sliding contact with the undersurface of skin portion 49 at all operative positions of the variable camber airfoil 21. Referring now to figures 4,8 and 9 conjointly, it will be observed that during negative down deflection, link L2 which may, as previously indicated, comprise a torque arm driven by a suitable rotary actuator, not shown moves in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in the drawing fran the cruise camber position shown in fig.4, to the consecutive deflected positions depicted in figures 8 and 9 wherein the variable camber airfoil 21 is shown in a partially deflected position fig.8 and a fully deflected position fig.9 .As the angle of negative deflection 0 from the wing chord reference plane WCRP is progressiveiy increased, the hinged sliding flange 46 carried by the links L1 is flexed out of the plane of rigid skin panel 44 against the bias force exerted by the spring loaded hinged connection 48 and slides rearwardly beneath, and in face to face contact with, the skin 49 secured to the bottom surface of the structural wing box WB.During such deployment of the variable camber airfoil surface, the continuous upper flexible skin 31 is maintained in a stable structural condition of sub stantially constant curvature over its chord wise length by support link L7 which is pivotally secured i to the bracket 41 on the inner surface of flexible skin 31 at its chord wise mid point, and ii to control link L . Similarly, 6 upon rotation of link L2 in a clockwise direction from the cruise camber position shown in figure 4, the continuous skin variable camber airfoil 21 is deflected upwardly from the wing chord reference plane WCRP so as to define a positive up deflection angle 5 as clearly illustrated in Fig.10. It has been found that in carrying out the present invention, leading edge negative down deflection angles o of up to on the order of 230 and leading edge positive up deflection angles 2 o f up to on the order of 30 from the wing chord reference plane WCRP can be readily achieved without modification, elimination and or displacement of the structural wing box WB this despite the fact that the leading structural edge 30 and the entire actuating mechanism 29 used to deploy the leading edge 24 can be dimensioned to occupy from only 12 to 209s of the chord length CL fig.3 of the airfoil.The compact nature of the actuating mechanism permits attainment of such significant deflection angles and e without impingement upon the critical space reserved for the structural wing box WB even at angles of maximum negative down deflection on the order of 230 and, indeed, since such deflection angles can often be achieved using substantially less than 20 of the chord wise lengthCL of the airfoil, the invention actually permits of increase in the size of the wing box WB and, therefore, increased fuel storage capacity permitting significant increases in payload ranges.Moreover, the structural stability and rigidity of the actuating mechanism 29 is imparted via support link L7 to the upper flexible skin 31, thereby precluding skin flutter and maintaining optimum aerodynamic skin curvatures and airfoil contours. While the support link L7 has been found to be highly advantageous in many, if not most, aerodynamic applications, it should be understood that it need not necessarily be employed in all applications. For example, insome instances where negative deflection angles of 230 are not necessarily required, it is still possible to utilize the actuating mechanism 29 of the invention without a support link such as the link L7 provided that the chord wise length of the flexible panel 31 is reduced and or the thickness of the panel 31 is increased, thereby permitting attainment of the desired constant curvature and avoiding skin fitter. In keeping with the present invention and, for the purpose of further enhancing the stability and rigidity of the actuating mechanism 29, the two main load carrying members of the actuating mechanism viz., control links L and L3 are dualized with all pivot pin connections in double shear, Thus, as best illustrated in Fig.11, it will be observed that each 4 bar linkage assembly employed to control horizontal and vertical displacement of the structural edge member 30 comprises a pair of parallel control linksL1 and a corresponding pair of parallel control links L3 respectively coupled thereto by pivot pins P1,3 passing through yokes 51 formed in the lower ends of the links L3. Similarly, although each actuating mechanism 29 employs only a single 4 bar linkage assembly for controlling the rotational angle of the structural edge member 30 and comprising the two parallel control links L1 and one each of links L4,L5 andL6 C.f., Figs. 4 and 11 ,the link L6 is provided with a yoke 52 at its inboard end permitting pivotal connection with link L5 by a pivot pin L5,6 in double shear. Link L6 is further provided with a centrally located vertical slot 54 positioned to receive the lower end of support link L7.thereby permitting pivot pin P6,7 to be maintained in double shear. As a consequence of this construction, actuating mechanisms 29 embodying the features of the present invention are highly rigid and stable yet, simple, compact and sufficiently controllable to permit both positive and negative deflection of the structural edge member 30 through wide ranges of operative deflection angles. Thus far, the present invention has been described in conjunction with an actuating mechanism 29 characterized by its ability to vary the camber of the leading edge 24 of a continuous skin airfoil 21.However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to usage in conjunction with leading edge actuating mechanisms but, in addition, it finds equally advantageous use in conjunction with variable camber trailing edges. Thus, referring to figures 12 and 13, there has been illustrated an actuating mechanism, generally indicated at 29 , which is, for all essential purposes, identical to the actuating mechanism 29 previously described in conjunction with figures 4 through 11.Because of the substantial identity of components except for relative dimensions those elements depicted in figures 12 and 13 which are substantially unchanged from those pre viously described except for dimension are identified by identical reference disgnations while those which are similar in construction and identical in function are described by identical primed reference designations. With the foregoing in mind, it will observed upon inspection of figures 12 and 13 that the variable camber trailing edge portion of the airfoil 21 employs a trailing edge structural member 30 which is carried by and supported from a rearwardly projecting main frame MF integral with the rearmost edge 32 of the structural wing box by means of a pair of 4 bar linkage assemblies which are identical to those hereinabove described but, which are reflected in figures 12 and 13 as mirror image representations of the actuating mechanism 29 shown in figures 4 11.As here shown, the continuous flexible upper skin 31 is secured to the trailing structural edge member 30 and forms a variable camber trailing edge flexible panel which defines a continuous uninterrupted smooth upper surface continuation of a rigid trailing edge assembly 55 defining the trailing edge 25 of the airfoil 21. In this instance, the lower rigid skin panel 44 carried by the control links L1 is provided with an upwardly curved forward edge 44a and an upwardly curved rearward edge 44b which respectively form close, relatively sliding, interfaces with the lower airfoil skin 49 carried by the structural wing box WB and the rigid trailing edge assembly 55. Thus, the arrangement is such that when the actuating mechanism 29 is actuated for example, by a conventional rotary or linear actuator not shown in the manner previously described to deflect the trailing edge 25 downwardly from the solid line cruise camber position shown in figure 12, link L2 is rotated in a clockwise direction about pivot P2 from the position shown towards the position of maximum negative down deflection depicted in figure 13. Alternatively, when positive up deflection is desired, link L2 is pivoted in a counterclockwise direction as reviewed in figure 12 to cause the rigid trailing edge assembly 55 to swing upwardly towards the broken line position shown in figure 12.It has been found that in the practice of the present invention, negative trailing edge deflection angles from the wing chord reference planeWCRP of up to on the order of 32 may be readily attained, while positive deflection angles 5 of up to on the order of 60 can be attained. Yet, the constant curvature of the variable camber surface of flexible skin 31 throughout the chord wise dimension of the skin can be maintained at all deflection angles, while the skin 31 is supported by support link L7 and, hence, skin flutter is essentially eliminated. Thus, it will be appreciated that there has herein been described a simple, compact actuating mechanism for use with continuous skin variable camber airfoils which is characterized by its stability and rigidity and which can be readily used with either or both of variable camber leading and or trailing edges without in any way impinging upon the space reserved for the structural wing box WB. Because of the structural stability and rigidity of the actuating mechanism which serves to provide all load bearing support, the continuous flexible upper skin is not required to function as a load bearing element. Maximum deflection angles may be readily attained and, the simple, positive, force transmitting nature of the 4 bar linkage assembly defined by links L1,L2 and L3 and main frame MF, insures that rapid response times can also be achieved permitting ease of in f lingt reconfiguration of airfoil contours.
