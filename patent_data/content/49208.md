# Magnetized conveyor chain element.

## Abstract
A magnetic conveyor including chain links 30 with article carrying portions having magnetic filler material 31 dispersed throughout to impart magnetic properties to the conveyor chain for conveying ferro magnetic articles. Preferably, the chain links comprise a polymeric resin material with the magnetic material 31 dispersed therein during the molding process. Magnetization to provide multiple poles allows a minimum amount of filler material to be used thereby resulting in a relatively small reduc tion in the strength of the chain.
