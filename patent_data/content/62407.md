Particularly suitable cephalosporins for use in the compositions of this invention include cephaloridine and cefazolin which may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt for example the sodium salt. When present together with a cephalosporin or penicillin, the ratio of a compound of the invention to the penicillin or cephalosporin agent may vary over a wide range of ratios, such as from 10 1 to 1 10 for example about 3 1, 2 1, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5 or 1 6 wt wt, based on pure free antibiotic equivalent . The total quantity of a compound of the invention in any unit dosage form will normally be between 25 and 1000 mg and will usually be between 50 and 500 mg, for example about 62.5, 100, 125, 150, 200 or 250 mg.

Such compositions containing di salts of carbenicillin and ticarcillin will be adapted for parenteral administration. The present invention also provides a method of treating bacterial infections in animals, in particular humans or domestic mammals, which comprises the administration of a composition of this invention. Commonly the infection treated will be due to a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes,Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Bacteroides fragilis or the like. The organisms believed to be most readily treated by an antibacterially effective amount of a compoound of this invention is Staphylococcus aureus.The other organisms named are more readily treated by using a synergistically effective amount of the compound of the invention and a penicillin or cephalosporin. The administration.of the two components may take place separately but in general we prefer to use a composition containing both the synergist and the penicillin or cephalosporin. The indications for treatment include respiratory tract and urinary tract infections in humans and mastitis in cattle. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI12.1 wherein Rê and R are as defined with respect to formula I hereinbefore and Rx is a carboxy blocking group with a compound of formula R4 X where X is a leaving group and thereafter where necessary removing the carboxy blocking group RX and converting the compound to an in vivo hydrolysable ester. Suitable groups X include halogen, such as iodine, bromine, or a sulphate group SO4R4, an oxonium residue such as R4 2BF4 or an alkyl. or aryl sulphonate such as methanesulphonate, or p toluensulphonate. For example, where R4 is methyl, suitable compounds R4 X include methyl iodide, methyl bromide and dimethylsulphate. The starting material of formula III is disclosed in U.K. Patent No. 1566706. The compounds of formula III may be prepared by reacting a secondary amine of formula IV EMI13.1 with a compound R. X. For the preparation of compounds I1 where R3 R, compound IV may conveniently be reacted with two equivalents of compound R3 X, without isolating the intermediate compound III . The compounds of formula IV may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding primary amine with a compoundRê X. Similarly, when Rê R R4, compounds I may be prepared by reacting the primary amine with 3 equivalents of compound Rê X without isolating the intermediates III or Ty . Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the x group C02R in formula III include ester derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is preferably one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. Suitable ester forming carboxyl blocking groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions. Such groups for Rx include benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, 3,5 di t butylbenzyl4 hydroxy benzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 tribromoethyl, allyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, 2 benzyloxyphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, methoxymethyl, a silyl, stannyl or phosphorus containing group, or an in vivo hydrolysable ester radical such as defined above. The carboxylic group or a salt thereof may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Rx group, for example, base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymicallycatalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogention. A preferred group RX i s the silyl group, in particular the trimethylsilyl group which may be removed by aqueous hydrolysis. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or methylene dichloride, preferably in the presence of a strong non nucleophilic organic base, and at a non extreme temperature for example 10 to 50 , more usually 5 to 20 and conveniently in the range 5 to 10 . Suitable strong non nucleophilic organic bases include 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0. non 5 ene DBN . The desired product may be obtained from the reaction mixture by evaporation of the solvent.Purification may be effected by crystallisation for example before all the solvent has been evaporated off or by column chromatography, for example using silica gel or cellulose and butanol ethanol water 4 1 1. Certain compounds within formula I and protected derivatives thereof possess the additional utility as intermediates in the preparation of tertiary amines. Accordinly the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula V EMI15.1 wherein RÚ, Rê and R are defined with respect to formula I which process comprises hydrogenation of aEMI16.1 wherein R6 is CO2, CO2H or CO2Rx, and wherein Rx, Rê, R n and Z are as defined above and R7 is a group R which is hydrogenolysable and thereafter where necessary removing a carboxy blocking group Rx and converting the product to a pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable ester. Suitable groups R include benzyl, benzyl substituted by up to three groups selected from halogen,C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy, nitro, hydroxy, carboxy or C1 6 alkoxy carbonyl. The hydrogenation is normally carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. The catalyst we have preferred to use is palladium, for example in the form of palladium on carbon charcoal , palladium on barium sulphate, palladium on calcium carbonate or the like. A favoured catalyst is palladium on carbon sometimes referred to as palladium on charcoal for example 5 , 10 , 20 or 30 palladium on carbon. The higher palladium content catalyst are particularly apt as smaller total weights of catalyst can be employed thereby avoiding possible problems associated with. absorption of product onto the carbon. A low, medium or high pressure of hydrogen may be used in this reaction, for example from 1 to 6 atmospheres.In general if the catalyst used contains a lower percentage of palladium for example 5 or 10 palladium then better yields of the desired product are obtained using a pressure of about 3 to 5 atmospheres of hydrogen, for example about 4 atmospheres of hydrogen. In general if the catalyst used contains a higher percentage of palladium for example 20 or 30 palladium then acceptable yields of the desired product may also be obtained at low and medium pressures of hydrogen, for example about 1 to 2 atmospheres of hydrogen.We have found it convenient to use an atmospheric or slightly superatmospheric pressure of hydrogen in conjunction with higher palladium content catalysts. The reaction is normally carried out at a nonextreme temperature, for example from 0 C to 30 C and more usually from 120C to 25 0C. It is generally convenient to carry out the reaction at ambient temperature. Suitable solvents for carrying out the hydrogenation include ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate or mixtures of such solvents or such solvents in the presence of water. A favoured solvent is aqueous tetrahydrofuran. A further favoured solvent is a mixture of isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran and water. The product may generally be isolated from the reaction mixture by filtering off the solids the catalyst, which should be well washed to remove the product and then evaporating the solvent, preferably under low pressure, to yield the initial product. The desired product is normally obtained in crystalline form unless it is an unsalted ester .Trituration under ethanol, isopropanol or the like C14 alkanol or other conventional solvent such as a ketone, ether or ester solvent or other conventional solvent for example of up to 6 carbon atoms and more suitably of up to 4 carbon atoms may also be used to aid crystallisation.
