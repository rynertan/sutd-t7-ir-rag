# Controlled braze joining of electronic packaging elements.

## Abstract
A brazed joint that is not significantly degraded by repeated heating at temperatures above the original brazing operation is made between two surfaces by providing a tin gettering metal layer 20, 22 on either one or both of the surfaces to be joined, placing a mass 24 of low melting gold tin alloy between the surfaces, heating to melt the mass of gold tin alloy, and subsequently applying a pressure to force the surfaces together to squeeze the major portion of the molten alloy from the joint, while maintaining the joint at the temperature sufficient to react the major portion of the remaining tin with the tin gettering layer, and subsequently cooling the resultant brazed joint. When pressure is applied, the volume of the molten gold tin between the surfaces to be joined is significantly reduced, thereby reducing the amount of tin, which when combined with gold, increases the melting point. As the tin gettering layer 20, 22 removes the major portion of the remaining tin, the melting point of the molten volume is raised and it freezes, forming a bond of an alloy with higher melting temperature. Since this resultant bond will with stand significantly higher heating without melting, it will withstand repeated rework operations on the substrate 12 without degrading.
