# PULSE WIDTH CONTROL OF BONDING BALL FORMATION

## Abstract
A method, timing control circuit, and power supply are described for initiating arc discharge between the cover gas delivery shroud and lead wire held in the bonding tool of a lead wire bonding machine for melting and forming a ball at the end of the lead wire. An arc discharge timing control pulse controls duration of the arc discharge within an empiri cally determined time window between the shortest and longest durations of arc discharge which result in optimal ball formation of a substantially spherical ball at the end of the lead wire without necking of the lead wire above the formed ball. The timing control circuit also provides an initial cover gas movement delay before ball formation for displa cing oxygen from the shield and the end of the lead wire, and sequent cooling delay for solidifying and cooling the formed ball in the cover gas stream prior to ball bonding. Initially, the lead wire tail length extending below the bond ing tool is selected to provide a ball of specified size the voltage is selected according to tail length to form the mass of tail length metal into a substantially spherical ball and a neck of desired thickness is selected by adjusting the dura tion of the arc discharge timing control pulse within the time window.
