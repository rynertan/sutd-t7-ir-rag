# Magnetic refrigerator.

## Abstract
A magnetic refrigerator includes a plurality of working substances 15 each of which, when it is within a magnetic field, generates heat and, when it is outside the magnetic field, absorbs the heat to permit a gas to be condensed on the outer surface of the working substance. The working substance has even surfaces and an uneven surface formed on said outer surface thereof. A heat elimination system 32 which, only when the working substance is within the magnetic field, contacts the even surfaces of the working substance to take the heat from the working substance, is provided.
