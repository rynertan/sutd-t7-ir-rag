# A DEVICE FOR GRASPING, AUTOMATICALLY CENTERING AND ALIGNING THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF LONG BODIES ACCORDING TO THE WORKING AXIS

## Abstract
The device permits of grasping, centering automatically and aligning the longitudinal axis of a long body in particular of a pen body according to the working axis B or corresponding to the following operation carried out on a machine tool preferably automatic. It comprises a toggle lifting mechanism 6, 7, 8, 9 provided with graspings jaws 8 , 9 of the long body, jaws made angled by which grasping the long body they deter mine the movement of translation until bringing the longitu dinal axis A into the exact position of centering and alignment with the working axis B or corresponding to the following operation.
