# HCG sandwich type immunoassay and reducing LH cross reactivity in an immunological reaction for HCG with LH present.

## Abstract
A method for reducing the cross reactivity of LH when analyzing for hCG in a biologically derived fluid sample which includes both hCG and LH. The technique may be a conventional sandwich type immunoassay in which the hCG is bound to immobilized antibody and to free labeled antibody, to form a sandwich. The binding to the two different antibodies may be performed either simultaneously or sequentially. The improvement involves the binding of the labeled antibody in a buffered solution at a limited concen tration of salt, typically sodium chloride, namely, to a maximum concentration of 0.5 weight volume of the salt, to reduce the cross reactivity with LH. Reduction in LH cross reactivity is also assisted by reducing the buffering agent concentration.

## Description
HCG SANDWICH TYPE IMMUNOASSAY AND REDUCING LH CROSSREACTIVITY IN AN IHUNtLOGICAL FACTION FOR HCG WITH LH PRESENTMonoclonal antibodies are highly useful for the analysis of various glycoprotein hormones such as human choriogonadotropin hCG . hCG is analyzed from biologically derived samples, e.g., derived from urine or serum. A particularly effective technique is known as the two site sandwich methodology, using enzyme labels as set forth in H.G. Wada et al., Clin.Chem. 28 9, 1862 1866 1982 . The anti alpha subunit monoclonal antibody is used as the solid phase e.g., a coated tube to capture the hCG. Luteinizing hormone LH may be present at significant concentrations in serum or urine. During incubation, the immobilized antibody captures both the hCG and LH. Anti beta subunit monoclonal antibodies are coupled to a label, such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, and reacted with the bound hCG and LH on the solid surface. The free labeled antibody is separated from the bound antibody, and the label on the latter is detected. In the Wada et al article, this technique is performed in a so called simultaneous sandwich technique, i.e., binding of the hCG to the immobilized antibody and to the labeled antibody are performed in a single incubation step. The sandwich technique is also known to be performed sequentially so that the serum or ,urine sample is first incubated with the solid phase immobilized antibody , the soluble sample is removed, and then the solid phase is immunologically reacted with the labeled antibody.One problem with the above sandwich technique is the cross reactivity of LH in the tested sample for the labeled antibody.Thus, as set forth in the above Wada et al paper, cross reactivity was shown to be 8.38 for LH at vg L or 200 international units L IU L .In accordance with the present invention, crossreactivity for LH in a sandwich type immunoassay for hCG is significantly reduced by controlling the maximum salt content of the buffered solution uti lived during reaction of the labeled antibody with the hCG. The maximum salt content is on the order of 0.5 weight volume in the buffered solution, in comparison to a standard buffered solution containing about 0.9 weight volume .The present invention relates to a sandwich type of immunoassay for hCG in a biologically derived fluid, typically derived from serum or urine.In the sandwich type of immunoassay to which the present invention is applicable, monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of hCG and LH is first immobilized onto a solid surface. Then, it is contacted with the serum or urine, and the hCG and accompanyingLH in the sample is bound to the immobilized antibody. Anti beta subflnit monoclonal antibodies coupled to a label, preferably an enzyme, is contacted with the hCG and bound thereto. Then, the free labeled antibody is removed and the bound labeled antibody is detected as a measure of the quantity of hCG in the fluid sample. The two incubation steps may be performed sequentially for either serum or urine samples. On the other hants, the simulteneous technique may be utilized for urine Example, but preferably not for a serum sample.This is because other proteins in the serum sample can cause a non specific binding problem for the enzyme labeled antibody.In the first step, the antibody is immobilized by binding to a solid surface such as a tube, stick, beads, plate, paper, a disk or the like. Typically, the surface to be coated is the interior of a test tube or the end of a dip stick, convenient surfaces for coating and washing.One suitable surface for bonding of antibody is a plastic material such as polystyrene, polypropylene, or the like. Other plastic materials may also be employed. The advantage of plastic such as polystyrene is that relatively strong bonds are formed by adsorption. Antibody may also be covalently bonded to the above plastic materials or other solid materials. The use of such covalent bonding techniques is described in Biochemical Aspects of Reactions onSolid Supports, G . R. Stark, Ed., Academic Press, 1970.In a typical instance, the antibody to be immobilized is dissolved in a suitable buffer e.g., phosphate buffered isotonic saline at a suitable pH. A suitable antibody concentration is between 0.5 and 50 pg ml. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of antibody solution is placed into the bottom of a test tube formed, for example, of polystyrene or polypropylene. The filled tubes are incubated at room temperature for 4 to 48 hours. After adsorption, excess antibody is removed such as by washing in a suitable wash solution. As set forth above, the present invention is applicable to either a simultaneous or a sequential type of immunoassay method for hCG. Referring to the sequential assay, the biologically derived sample urine or serum which includes hCG and LH, is contacted with the immobilized anti alpha subunit monoclonal antibody bound in a solid layer to a solid surface. For simplicity of description, the present specification will refer to the immobilized antibody as a layer on the inside surface of a test tube. The sample is incubated in the test tube until the hCG and LH in the sample are immunologically bound to the antibody to form a solid phase of immobilized antibody immunologically bound to hCG and LH referred to herein as antibody thCG and LH .Then, the sample solution is removed from the test tube, typically followed by one or more washing steps.Thereafter, free labeled anti beta subunit monoclonal antibody, specific for the beta subunit of hCG but also reactive with LH, is added to the test tube in a buffered solution of a precise maximum quantity of a salt which includes potassium chloride, sodium chloride, or both. The mixture is then incubated to cause an immunological reaction, to thereby form a sandwich of immobilized antibody hCG and LH labeled antibody. The reaction mixture containing the free labeled antibody is then separated from the bound labeled antibody on the solid surface, and the bound labeled antibody is detected as a measure of the quantity of hCG in the fluid sample.Control of cross reactivity for LH in the fluid sample by controlling a character of the buffered solution in which the labeled antibody is present during incubation is a major feature of the present invention. A conventional solution for the labeled antibody is an isotonic buffered solution with a salt concentration of 0.9 weight volume sodium chloride.At such concentrations, it has been found that there is significant cross reactivity for LH. Crossreactivity is determined by assaying for LH in the absence of hCG. Cross reactivity is defined in the following equation. Cross Reactivity LH assay concentration x 100 LH actual concentrationBy reducing the salt concentration, LH cross reactivity is reduced. One problem in reducing crossreactivity for the LH is that there is a loss in the detection of a certain amount of hCG in the sample.However, this loss in reactivity of the hCG is far less than the loss in reactivity of the LH. Thus, the preferred buffer solution is one that provides an acceptable minimum reductidn in the detection of the hCG, while maximizing the loss in cross reactivity ofLH. In that regard, it has been found that a preferred concentration of buffering agent is in the 40 to 60 mM range, with a preferred salt concentration of the order of 0.1 weight volume . It has been found that, for typical buffer solutions, the preferred salt concentration is from 0.05 to 0.5 weight volume salt. This is substantially lower than the conventional 0.9 sodium chloride used in a conventional buffered solution.The concentration of buffering agent in the buffered solution also has an effect upon the amount of cross reactivity. Thus, in a typical buffer solution of 10 mM tris, the cross reactivity drops to a significantly lower level than in a 50 mM tris buffer solution. When the concentration of buffering agent is increased, say to 100 mM, the cross reactivity significantly increases. Thus, it is preferable that the buffering agent be present at a concentration no greater than 100 mM. Any conventional buffering agent for this system may be utilized, such as phosphate e.g., sodium phosphate , tris e.g., tris MgC12 buffer , glycine, and histidine borate.As set forth above, the present invention is also applicable to the simultaneous immunoassay technique as well as the above described sequential technique.There the usample and labeled antibody are. added simultaneously to the tube containing the immobilized antibody to form the above described sandwich.Thereafter, the free labeled antibody and the sample are separated from the test tube and the bound labeled antibody on the tube is detected as a measure of the quantity of hCG in the fluid sample. The limits of concentration of the salt and buffering agent are calculated on the basis of the solution of labeled antibody in the absence of the sample. A suitable general technique for performing simultaneous sandwich type immunoassay in accordance with the present invention is described in the aforementioned Wada et al article, with the exception that the specific buffer solution of the present invention is substituted for the one described in that paper.Any of the known techniques may be employed to irreversibly bind the label, preferably enzyme, to the free antibody for use in the present invention.See, for example, the Periodate method described inWilson, M. B., et al, in Immuno fluorescence andRelated Staining Techniques W. Knapp, et al, Eds., Elsevier North Holland Biomedical Press, New YorkAmsterdam, 1978, pp. 215 224.The enzyme activity of the solid phase is determined by incubation with a substrate and measuring the reaction.Although the present system is described using enzyme as the preferred label, it should be understood that the same principles apply to other labels such as of the radioactive, fluorometric, or colorometric type.A further disclosure of the nature of the present invention is prssided by the following specific examples of its practice. It should be understood that the data disclosed serves only to exemplify and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.Percentage concentrations are on a weight volume basis. Percent cross reactivity is abbreviated as 11 CRX .Example 1 Sequential Sandwich Immunoassay for hCG A polystyrene tube is coated with anti alpha subunit monoclonal antibody specific for the alpha chain of hCG and LH clone A57B5 . hCG is partially purified for pregnancy urine and calibrated against WHO 1stIRP no. 75 537. LH is calibrated against WHO 1st IRP 68 40. The system is incubated to bind LH and hCG to the walls of the tube.Excess sample is then washed with a solution of normal saline containing surfactant. After washing, a specific monoclonal antibody for the beta chain of the hCG clone 5004 is added. The antibody is covalently coupled to the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. The antibody enzyme conjugate is added in a tris buffer solution containing 1 mg ml bovine serum albumin, a surfactant 0.04 Tween 20 and sodium chloride at concentrations of 0 , 0.1 , and 0.9 . Unbound, or free, antibody enzyme conjugate is washed away with a saline solution containing surfactant as set forth above. The enzyme substrateBCIP 5 bromo, 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate is then added in a tris MgCl2 buffer, at a concentration of I mg ml and a pH of 9.8, and allowed to incubate until a blue color develops.The enzyme reaction is then stopped with a solution of 10mM EDTA, and read in a spectrophotometer at 620 nm.The results of two different runs using the above procedure are set out in Table 1. TABLE 1 Run 1 Run 2Na Cl Conc 0.0 0.9 0.1 0.9 OmIU ml hCG 0.007 0.009 0.026 0.025 50mIU ml hCG 0.056 0.108 0.100 0.119 400mIU ml LH 0.010 0.109 0.056 0.151 CRX 0.8 12.5 5.3 16.8 Example 2The above procedure was utilized varying the sodium chloride concentration sequentially from at 0.9 , 0.45 , 0.1 , 0.045 for tris buffer solutions at 10 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM. The results are set forth inTable 2 on the following page.Example 3The procedure of Example 2 is followed with the exception that potassium chloride was substituted for sodium chloride. The results are set forth inTable 3 on the following page.It is apparent from Example 3 that, as the salt concentration is decreased within the above ranges, so does the LH cross reactivity. This holds true for potassium chloride or sodium chloride salt at the different concentrations of tris buffer. Although the decrease is present at these different concentrations, it is also apparent that the cross reactivity is higher for higher buffer content, but the detectibility of the hCG remains at a more constant high level.

In this way the sandwich formation takes place during one incubation time. The remainder of the assay is identified. In this system, the antigen is incubated with enzyme conjugate for 30 minutes at room temperature.Unbound antigen and enzyme conjugate are then washed away with a saline solution as set forth in Example 1. BCIP substrate is allowed to incubate until blue color develops. Enzyme reaction is then stopped and read as set forth in Example 1. The tris buffer was maintained at 50 mM.
