# Coating process and moisture curable organopolysiloxane compositions therefor.

## Abstract
Novel organopolysiloxane compositions, which cure rapidly from the liquid to the non liquid state when exposed to moisture, are used to rapidly coat a substrate, such as label release liner, with an adhesive releasing coating. Curing of the liquid coating occurs in 5 seconds at room temperature in some cases. The organopolysiloxane compositions con tain a large amount of a metal ester, such as tetraisopropyl titanate, dissolved in an organopolysiloxane fluid which has moisture reactive, silicon bonded alkoxysilylorganic radi cals.

## Description
COATING PROCESS AND MOISTURE CURABLv ORGANOPOLYSILOXANE COMPOSITIONS THEREFOR The present invention relates to a process for coating a substrate with an organopolysiloxane composition, to moisture curable organopolysiloxane compositions which are used in said process and to organopolysiloxanes which are used in said compositions. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for rapidly providing a cured, adhesive releasing organopolysiloxane coating on a flexible sheet substrate at room temperature, to rapidly curable organopolysiloxane compositions therefor and to organopolysiloxane fluids that are particularly suited therefor. Rapidly curable coating compositions are required in fast paced coating operations, such as paper or fiber coating operations, wherein, in rapid succession, a curable composition is applied to a substrate, the applied composition is cured and the coated substrate is subjected to further operations such as packaging, spooling, rolling, cutting or further coating. Organopolysiloxane coating composItions which are rapidly curable are known however, they require the use of added energy, such as heat or radiation, to achieve rapid curing. Since the use of added energy is frequently precluded when the substrate to be coated is easily damaged, and with all coating operations represents an added cost, there exists a definite need for an organopolysiloxane coating composition which will cure rapidly on a substrate without the use of added energy. Moisture curable organopolysiloxane compositIons cure without the use of added energy however, moisture curable compositions of the art are not regarded as being rapidly curable. The most common examples of these moisture curable organopolysiloxane compositions are the acid, alcohol, aide or oxime releasing compositions which find use as encapsulants, sealants and caulks. These common compositions comprise an organopolysiloxane component which bears hydrolyzable radicals which are bonded to siloxane silicon atoms, i.e. silicon atoms which are bonded to other silicon atoms through a siloxane linkage. They are not, however, rapidly curable since they take several minutes to become tack free and hours to become fully cured. Of more relevance to the present invention are the moisture curable compositions of Weyenberg, U.S.Patent No. 3,175,993 Brown et al., U.S. PatentNo, 3,122,522 and Homan et al. r U.S. Patent No. 4,269,963. The compositions of Weyenberg consist essentially of a siloxane component which contains two to three alkoxy or haloalkoxy radicals bonded to each of two, three or four terminal silcarbane silicon atoms, i.e. terminal silicon atoms which are bonded to other silicon atoms through divalent hydrocarbon radicals instead of the usual divalent oxygen atoms, and,optionally, a catalyst component for accelerating tte cure of the siloxane component in the presence of moisture. The curing rate of the compositions of Weyenberg is said to be variable by the choice of said catalyst and the functional groups present in the system. A portion of this teaching is supported by weyenbergs examples which show that as the catalyst is varied from stannous octoate to tetraisopropyl titanate to tetrakis methylcellosolve titanate the tack free cure time of the composition ranges from 4U minutes to less than 24 hours to 48 hours, respectively, Weyenberg further states that the amount of catalyst is not critical but is normally present in an amount of from 0.1 to 2 percent by weight, based on the weight of siloxane. The suggested uses for the compositions ofWeyenberg are as coating compositions, sealants, impregnating compounds and for electrical insulation. It can be seen from the disclosure of Weyenberg that neither rapidly curing compositions nor rapid coating processes are contemplated therein. The compositions of Brown et al. consist essentially of a siloxane component which contains two or three cellosolvoxy radicals bonded to at least two terminal silcarbane silicon atoms, i.e. terminal silicon atoms which are bonded like those described in Weyenberg s disclosure above, and optionally a catalyst component for accelerating the cure of the siloxane component in the presence of moisture. When the catalyzed compositions of Brown et al.are exposed to moisture, their viscosities are said to gradually increase and cure follows thereafter. The catalyst component is preferably present in an amount that ranges from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts of siloxane to provide maximum catalyst efficiency. However, rapid cure rate of the catalyzed compositions of Brown et al. is not contemplated therein. The compositions of Homan et al. comprise a siloxane component which contains at least two sulfur containing siloxane units and no more than 10 mol percent pendant sulfur containing siloxane units per molecule, and optionally a curing catalyst to accelerate the cure of the siloxane component in the presence of moisture. The sulfur contoining siloxane units contain two or three methoxy or ethoxy radicals bonded to a silicon atom which is bonded to another silicon atom by an oxygen free, sulfur containing, divalent thioether radical The catalyzed compositions of Homan et al. are said to spontaneously and rapidly cure when exposed to moisture however, specific cure times recited by Homan et al. range fros S to 45 minutes. Rapid curing of Homan s compositions is thus not apparent. It is thus apparent that, while the art discloses compositions that cure rapidly and compositions that cure without the use of added energy, it does not disclose organosiloxane compositions that cure rapidly without the use of added energy. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process, a composition useful therein and an organopolysiloxane fluid therefor for rapidly coating a substrate with a cured organopolysiloxane coating. It is a particular object of this invention to provide a process, a composition useful therein and an organopolysiloxane fluid therefor for rapidly coating at least one surface of a flexible sheet substrate with a cured, adhesive releasing organopolysiloxane coating. It is also an object of this invention to provide a process, a composition useful therein and an organopolysiloxane fluid therefor for rapidly coating a substrate with a cured organopolysiloxane coating that does not require added energy to achieve rapid curing of the organopolysiloxane coating. These objects, and others which will become apparent to those skilled in the organopolysiloxane coating art upon consideration of the following disclosure and appended claims, are obtained by the present invention which, briefly stated, comprises applying a thin coating of the moisture curing compositions of this invention to a substrate and suitably exposing the applied composition to moisture. The compositions of this invention are prepared by mixing components comprising certain alkoxy substituted organopolysiloxane fluids and a sufficient amount of a soluble, metal ester to provide a tack free cure time of less than two minutes for the coating composition. The alkoxy substituted organopolysiloxane fluid and the metal ester can each be either a known material or a novel material disclosed herein. Properly formulated compositions of this invention have the unexpected advantage of curing so rapidly when applied to paper that they experience little or no soak in, even on highly porous paper. This characteristic allows the compositions of this invention to be used on less expensive grades of paper and or at reduced coverage rates, compared to the slower curing compositions of the art, to obtain effective adhesive release therefrom. While not wishing to be limited by theory, I believe that when an amount of a metal ester is used in the compositions of this invention which is greater than the catalytic levels taught in the art the resultant rapid curing of the composition in the presence of moisture is due in large part to rapid formation of numerous metal O Si bonds, in addition to the usual metal catalyzed formation of Si O Si bonds. More specifically, the present invention relates, in a first aspect, to a liquid composition which cures to a non liquid composition when exposed to moisture, said liquid composition being prepared by mixing, under substantially anhydrous conditions, components comprising A an organopolysiloxane fluid comprising at least two silicon bonded, alkoxysilylorganic radicals having the formola QSiR 1 OR2 whercin Q denotes a divalent organic radical bonded to silicon atoms by silicon carbon bonds, R1 denotes a monovalent hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms R2 denotes a methyl, ethyl, propyl or methoxyethyl radical and a has a value of O or 1, and B a metal ester, soluble in said liquid composition, selected from the group consisting of titanium esters, zirconium esters, hafnium esters and vanadium oxide esters the amounts of components A and B being sufficient to provide a tack free cure time of less than 120 seconds for the liquid composition. In Its broadest form, this aspect of the present invention relates to a liquid composition which has a tack free cure time of less than 120 seconds, as measured by the Tack Free Cure Time test method described below, and contains at least an alkoxy substituted organopolysiloxane fluid, further described below, and a metal ester dissolved in the organopolysiloxane fluid. When the organopolysiloxane fluid contains at least two, and preferably more, silicon bonded alkoxysilylorganic radicals having the formula QSiR1fOR2 3 at a composition having a tack free time of less than 120 seconds can be prepared by dissolving a sufficient amount of a metal ester in the organopolysiloxane fluid.Said sufficient amount of metal ester depends on the particular metal ester and the particular organopolysiloxane fluid that is used, as detailed below. The cumpositions of this invention are liquid compositions. That is to say, the compositions of this invention can be applied to a substrate by flowing, spreading, extruding, rolling, brushing and the like. When the compositions of this invention are exposed to moisture, they cure to the non liquid state. Component A of the compositions of this invention can be any organopolysiloxane fluid which contains at least two alkoxysilylorganic radicals having the formula a OR2 3 a The alkoxysilylorganic radicals can be bonded to terminal siloxane units and or to non terminal siloxane units of the organopolysiloxane, which can have a molecular structure which is branched, linear and or cyclic. In the alkoxysilylorganic radical shown above, Q denotes a divalent organic radical which is bonded to silicon atoms by silicon carbon bonds. The specific structure of Q is not critical as long as it does not adversely affect the utility of the compositions of this invention as a rapidly curing coating composition, and particularly as an adhesive releasing, paper coating composition. Typically, the particular Q radical is further selected on the basis of organopolysiloxane synthesis methods and starting materials therefor, further delineated below. For example, Q can be an alkylene radical such as c 2H4 or C3H6 which arises from readily available vinyl or allyl substituted silanes or siloxanes. Q can be, for example, an ester containing radical such as CH2CH CH3 CO2CH2CH2CH2 which arises from readily available methacryloxypropyl substituted silanes.As another example, Q can be a urethane containing radical such as CH2CH2CH2 OCH2CH2 7O2CNHCH2CH2CH2 which arises from readily available alcohol substituted siloxanes and isocyanatoalkyl substituted silanes. Based on the above delineation, other suitable Q radicals will occur to the reader of ordinary skill in the organopolysiloxane coatings art and are within the scope of the present claims. To obtain maximum ease of adhesive release from the cured compositions of this invention, Q preferably contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms and most preferably is an alkylene of the formula CnH 2n having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as CE2CH2 . In the alkoxysilylorganic radicalown above, and in the organopolysiloxanes disclosed herein, R1 denotes any monovalent hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6, both inclusive, carbon atoms. Examples of R1 radicals include alkyl radicals, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl cycloaliphatic radicals, such as cyclohexyl aliphatically unsaturated radicals, such as vinyl, allyl, butenyl and cycl6hexenyl and aryl radicals, such as phenyl. RT, at each occurrence, is preferably the methyl radical in view of its favorable adhesive releasing characteristics, ready availability and ease of preparation. In the alkoxysilylorganic radical, each R2 denotes a radical selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl and methoxyethyl radicals. For rapid curing of the compositions of this invention on a paper substrate, as measured by the smear, migration, rub off test delineated below it is preferred that each R2 be a methyl radical. For maxirmirn cure rate for any particular composition of this invention, the alkoxysilylorganic radicals are preferably trialkoxysilylorgano radicals QSi OR2 3 , such as QSi OMe 3 radicals however, QSiNe QMeJ2 radicals also provide highly desirable cure rates. As noted above, component A can have any suitable siloxane structure as long as it is a fluid and contains at least two alkoxysilylorganic radicals.Preferably, said siloxane structure consists of two or more siloxane units selected from terminal siloxane units of the formulae RR21SiO1 2 and R31SiO1 2 and non terminal siloxane units of the formulae RR1SiO2 2, R21SiO2 2,RSiO3 2, R1SiO3 2 and SiO4 2 wherein R denotes the above delineated alkoxysilylorganic radical and R1 is as denoted above. It should be stated that, if desired, a minor portion of the R1 radicals in the above listed siloxane units can be replaced with R1 radicals which have been substituted with substituents that are unreactive with the metal ester, such as halogen atoms, such as fluorine and chlorine or organic groups, such as cyano, amido and carbalkoxy. Examples of siloxane units having the above formulae include terminal units such as Me3SiO1 2,PhMeViSiO1 2, Me2ViSiO1 2, Me2EtSiO1 2,H2NCOCH2CH2Me2SiO1 2, NCCH2CH2Me2SiO1 2,MeO2CCH2CH2Me2SiO1 2, ClCH2CH2CH2Me2SiO1 2,F3CCH2CH2Me2SiO1 2, RMe2SiO1 2 and RPhMeSiO1 2 and non terminal units such as Me2SiO2 2, PhMeSiO2 2, MeViSiO2 2, NCCH2CH2MeSiO2 2, MeO2CCH2CH2MeSiO2 2,CH3CONHCH2CH2CH2MeSiO2 2, F3CCH2CH2MeSiO2 2,ClCH2CH2CH2MeSiO2 2, RMeSiO2 2, RPhSiO2 2, RSiO3 2,MeSiO3 2, PhSiO3 2, MeO2CCH2CH2SiO3 2, ViSiO3 2, EtSiO3 2,NCCH2CH2SiO3,2, F3CCH2CH2SiO3 2 and ClCH2CH2CH2SiO3 2, wherein Me, Et, Vi and Ph denote the methyl, ethyl, vinyl and phenyl radicals, respectively. Most preferably, component A of the compositions of this invention has a linear siloxane structure having the formula Ia . ZR21SiO Me2SiO RR1SiO R21SiO zSiR21Z Ia . In formula Ia , Me denotes a methyl radical, Z denotes either an R radical or an R radical, and R and R1 have the meanings delineated above, including preferred delineations thereof. In formula Ia , x has a value of at least 50 and z has a value of from 0 to not more than x when theR1 radicals of the R1SiO siloxane units are not methyl. 12Of course, when R2SiO is Me2SiO the value of z is included in the value of x. The lower limit of 50 dimethylsiloxane units is established in order to provide preferred adhesive release for the coating compositions of this invention the upper limit for the value of z is established for the same reason. The value of x in formula Ia is preferably from 50 to 500, and most preferably from 100 to 400, and the value of z is selected to modify the physical properties of a cured composition of this invention as desired when R21SiO is not Me2SiO. The value of y in formula Ia can be from 0 fin which case each Z must be an R radical to x y z 4 in which case each Z may be an R radical or an R1 radical . The maximum value of Y should not exceed the value of x Z z 4, that is, 25 mol percent of the total nnsher of internal siloxane units in the organopolysiloxane, in order to provide a catalyzed composition that has a resistance to gelling in storage. For organopolysiloxanes wherein the value of x y z exceeds 120, the value of Y need not exceed the value of 3600 x y z in order to provide ideally rapid cure rates for the catalyzed compositions of this invention. Thus, as the value of x Z z is increased from 5Q to 66 2 3 to 120 and higher, and the value of x is at least 50 r the maximum permissible value of y ranges from 0 to 16 2 3 to 30 and higher, respectively however, the maximum ideal value of y ranges from 0 to 16 2 3 to 30 and then to progressively lower values, respectively.Ideally then, the organopolysiloxanes of this invention have no. more than 30 R radicals per molecule. As noted above, R1 and R2 are preferably methyl radicals, thereby giving rise to organopolysiloxanes having the formula Ib as a highly preferred component A of the compositions of this invention. ZMe2SiO Me2SiO x MeRSiO ySiMe2Z Ib In addition, each R radical in Ib is preferably QSiMea OMe 3 a for the reasons noted above. The value of x z in formula Ib is preferably from 100 to 400 and the value of y is preferably from 0 to 3600 x when the value of x z is 120 or greater and from 0 to x 4 when the value of x y is less than 120. That is to say, as the value of x z in formula Ib increases beyond 120 the preferred number of alkoxysilylorganic radicals that are present in component A decreases.There is, therefore, an opportunity to select an organopolysiloxane of formula Ib which represents a compromise between desirably low alkoxysilylorganic radical content and desirably low molecular weight. Preferred examples of component A which have the formula Ib are obtained when Q is an alkylene radical of the formula CnH2n wherein n has a value of 2 to 10. Structures having the formula Ib and being further illustrated by the examples disclosed below include Me3SiO Me2SiO x MeS1iO ySiMe3 Ic C H Sì OMe MeO 3SiCnH2n Me 2SiO Me2SiO xSi Me 2CnH2nSi OMe 3 Id and NeO 3SiCnH2n Ne 2SiO 2SiO x MeSiO ySi Me 2CnH2nSi 0Me 3 CnH2nS OMe Ie wherein x and Y are as noted above and may have such values as 100 and 5, 250 and 4, 400 and 3, 250 and 14, 100 and 7 and 400 and 9, respectively. Examples of known organopolysiloxane fluids which are useful as component A in the compositions of this invention include those disclosed by Brown et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,122,522 Weyenberg, U.S. PatentNo. 3,175,993 Gignac, Jr., U.S. Patent No. 3,509,081 andHoman et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,269,963 the disclosures of which show suitable examples of component A of the compositions of this invention. Examples of novel organopolysiloxane fluids which are useful as component A in the compositions of this invention include the organopolysiloxane fluids of this invention which comprise a second aspect of the present invention and which have the formula IIa . R21SiO Me2SiO x DR1SiO y R21SiO zSiR21z1 IIa The organopolysiloxanes of this invention ilk are a subset of the organopolysiloxanes described by formula Ia above in that Me, RI R2, x, z and a have the same meaning in each case, including preferred embodiments thereof, while the alkoxysilylorganic radicals D and Z1 radicals that are present in the organopolysiloxanes of this invention are encompassed by the alkoxysilylorganic radicals R and Z radicals of formula Ia but are further restricted therefrom as to minimum number value of and structure. The alkoxysilylorganic radicals that are present in the organopolysiloxanes of this invention are denoted by D and have the formula Q1SlRa OR2 a wherein denotes a divalent organic radical which is free of sulfur atoms. In all other respects, the delineation of Q radicals noted above is hereby applied to the class of Q1 radicals. The number of alkoxysilylorganic radicals that are present in formula IIa has a value of at least three. Thus, the organopolysiloxanes of this invention must contain at least one alkoxysilylorganic radical which is bonded to a non terminal siloxane unit of the organopolysiloxane. The organopolysiloxanes of this invention are particularly useful as component A in the compositions of this invention delineated above, although they are expected to also be useful as a base fluid for other moisture curing formulations, filled or unfilled. In accordance with the first aspect of this invention, a highly preferred class of organopolysiloxanes of this invention have the formula IIb . Z Me2SiO Me2SiO x MeDSiO ySiMe2Z1 lIb Furthermore, in formula IIb , D denotes the preferred radical QlSiMeatOMe 3 a for the reasons noted above for the preferred R radicals of organopolysiloxane Ib , the value of x v is preferably from 100 to 400 and the value of y, while having a lower limit of 1, has the same upper limit as noted for organopolysiloxane Ib3. Organopolysiloxanes Ic and Ie are highly preferred organopolysiloxanes of this invention. The particular advantages of using the organopolysiloxanes of this invention as a component A in the compositions of this invention, instead of the above described organopolysiloxanes that are old in the art, are that they are easier to synthesize than the branched organopolysiloxanes of Weyenberg or Brown et al., they are more reactive than the linear organopolysiloxanes of Weyenberg or Brown et al. and they do not have the sulfur odor of the organopolysiloxanes of Homan et al. It should be noted that although the formulae for the organopolysiloxanes disclosed above are written in groups of two or three types of internal siloxane units, the conventional interpretation, i.e. random arrangement of internal siloxane units, of these formulae is intended. It should also be noted that component A , whether or not it is an organopolysiloxane of this invention, can contain trace amounts of silicon bonded hydrogen atoms which remain unreacted after the preparation of said component without departing from the scope of this invention. The organopolysiloxanes of this invention can be prepared by any suitable method, preferably giving rise to a random arrangement of internal siloxane units.Accordingly, a siloxane equilibration reaction is preferably used at some point in their preparation. As is well known, siloxane equilibration provides a minor amount of cyclic1 as well as linear, organopolysiloxanes, even when terminal siloxane units are present in the equilibrating mixture. It is within the scope of the present invention to remove or not remove these cyclic organopolysiloxanes, as desired. Preferably, the organopolysiloxanes of this invention do not contain more than 15 percent by weight cyclic organopolysiloxanes that do not have alkoxysilylorganic radicals. The organopolysiloxanes of this invention are preferably prepared by a process which comprises a hydrosilylation reaction between an organopolysiloxane reactant containing silicon bonded hydrogen atoms or silicon bonded aliphatically unsaturated radicals and a silane reactant containing 2 or 3 OR radicals, 1 or 0, respectively, R1 radicals and 1 silicon bonded aliphatically unsaturated radical or 1 silicon bonded hydrogen atom, respectively. The hydrosilylation reaction thereby provides the organopolysiloxanes of this invention by creating the Q radical, delineated above, and bonding QSiRa OR2 3 a radicals to the organopolysiloxane through the Q radical. For example, an organopolysiloxane of this invention can be prepared by reacting, in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst, an organopolysiloxane reactant having the formula HR21SiO Me2SiO x HR1SiO y R21SiO zSiR21H, optionally containing up to an equilibrium amount of cyclic organopolysiloxane containing any combination ofMe2SiO siloxane units, HR1SiO siloxane units and R21SiO siloxane units, with a silane reactant having the formulaCH2 CHCH2SiR1 OR2 3 taken in sufficient amount to react with all available silicon bonded hydrogen atoms in the organopolysiloxane reactant. As another example, an organopolysiloxane of this invention can be prepared by reacting, in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst, an organopolysiloxane reactant having the formula R31SiO MeSiO x R1SiO y R21SiO zSiR31, CH C112 optionally containing up to an equilibrium amount of cyclic organopolysiloxane containing any combination ofMe2SiO siloxane units, R1SiO siloxane units and R21SiO CH CH3 siloxane units, with a silane reactant having the formulaHSiRa1 OR2 3 a, taken in sufficient amount to react with all available silicon bonded vinyl radicals in the organopolysiloxane reactant. In view of the disclosure above and the examples below, one skilled in the organosilicon art will be able to conceive other suitable methods for preparing the organopolysiloxanes of this invention. Component B of the compositions of this invention is a metal ester which is soluble in the organopolysiloxane component A or mixtures thereof with other components such as solvents. By soluble, it is meant herein that the amount of metal ester needed to provide the required amount of metal will dissolve in the liquid composition to provide a homogeneous, non settling composition. Metal esters are well known materials many are widely used and are commercially available. For the purposes of this invention, titanium esters, such as tetraalkyl titanates, are preferred metal esters. Examples of tetraalkyl titanates include titanium esters of methanol, ethanol, n propanol, i propanol, n butanol, s butanol, i butanol, t butanol, 2 ethylhexanol and octadecanol. Of the tetraalkyl titanates, tetraisopropyl titanate is the most preferred for the purposes of this invention. If a longer tack free time can be tolerated or if the compositions of this invention which are applied to a substrate can be heated to accelerate the cure rate thereof titanium esters other than tetraalkyl titanates can be used in the present invention. Thus, aryl titanates and titanium chelates, which are expected to function in the same manner as tetraalkyl titanates in the present invention but in a slower manner, are also contemplated in the present invention. Examples of these additional titanium esters include triethanolamine titanate, octyleneglycol titanate and bis acetylacetonyldiisopropyl titanate. The titanium ester can be unhydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed. Partially hydrolyzed titanium esters are those simple and complex compounds, and mixtures of compounds, that are obtained when a titanium ester, particularly a tetraalkyl titanate is exposed to water. Said exposure to water can be adventitious, such as that which occurs when a container of titanium ester is opened repeatedly or extensively to a moisture containing atmosphere or it can be deliberate, such as that which occurs when liquid water, per se or in a carrier liquid, is added to the titanium ester in a less than stoichiometric amount. The compositions of the present invention will cure when exposed to moisture, irrespective of whether a titanium ester or a partial hydrolyzate thereof, is present therein in the stated amount. However, the cure rate of any particular composition of this invention depends critically on the age of the composition if the composition has been prepared with an unhydrolyzed titanium ester and depends much less on the age of the composition if the composition has been prepared with a partial hydrolyzate of a titanium ester. That is to say when a curable composition of this invention is prepared with unhydrolyzed tetraalkyl titanate, particularly tetraisopropyl titanate, the composition should be cured by exposure to moisture within about 15 minutes after components A and B are mixed, preferably within about 10 minutes and most preferably within about 5 minutes, such as immediately, after components A and B are mixed, if a rapid cure rate is desired. As noted above, a rapid cure rate means that a tack free composition is obtained within 120 seconds after its exposure to moisture. Contrastingly, when a composition of this invention is prepared with a partial hydrolyzate of tetraisopropyl titanate, the composition displays a rapid cure rate when exposed to moisture any time within a period of about one hour after components A and B have been mixed. In addition to being a titanium ester or a partial hydrolyzate thereof, component B of the compositions of this invention can be a partial alcoholate, such as a methanolate or ethanolate of tetraisopropyl titanate. Said partial alcoholates of tetraisopropyl titanate are new and can be prepared by adding less than four, and preferably about 2, molar parts of methanol and or ethanol to one molar part of tetraisopropyl titanate. As with the partial hydrolyzates of titanium esters discussed above, partial alcoholates of tetraisopropyl titanate provide compositions of this invention which maintain their rapid cure rate for a longer period of time, e.g. up to two hours, than compositions prepared with unhydrolyzed tetraisopropyl titanate, and are, therefore, preferred. The amount of metal ester that is used in the compositions of this invention is merely that amount which will provide for the compositions a tack free cure time of less than 120 seconds as defined below. Preferably, a composition to be used in the method of this invention, detailed below, will provide a fully cured coating, as hereinafter defiried, within less than 60 seconds, and preferably within less than 30 seconds, after being applied to a substrate and exposed to moisture. When the compositions of this invention comprise an organopolysiloxane component A having the formula Ia , the metal ester is preferably a titanium ester and should be used in an amount that will provide from 0.5 to 4.0 parts by weight of titanium per 100 parts by weight of the organopolysiloxane. More preferably, a range of from 1.5 to 2.5 parts of titanium, on the same basis, is used.In terms of the preferred titanium ester, tetraisopropyl titanate, the amounts that will provide the stated amounts of titanium are 3 to 24 parts, preferably 9 to 15 parts. In terms of a novel and preferred partially methanolated tetraisopropyl titanate 80 TPT 20 MeOH on a weight basis , the corresponding amounts are 3.7 to 29.7 parts, preferably 11 to 18.5 parts. Although not as desired as titanium esters, esters of zirconium, hafnium or vanadium oxide which are analogous to the above described titanium esters can be used in place of titanates, if desired, in the compositions of this invention and suitable allowance can be made therefor with respect to amounts and curing temperatures. The moisture curing compositions of this invention are prepared by thoroughly mixing components comprising the appropriate amounts of component A and component B under substantially anhydrous conditions.Preferably, component B is added to component A . Any suitable mixing means can be used for said mixing. Preferably, a mixing means that will permit the prompt use, such as the substantially immediate use, of the resulting mixture as a coating composition is used. The moisture curing compositions of this invention can further comprise the usual optional components of moisture curable silicone compositions, such as fillers, colorants, stabilizers and diluents. Said optional components, if any, are preferably mixed with component A before component B is mixed therewithWhen a diluent is used, it may be desirable to mix said diluent with components A andfor B before A and B are mixed with each other. The moisture curing compositions of this invention can further comprise silanes of the formulaSiRb1 OR2 4 b, or partial hydrolyzates thereof, if desired, to modify the cured properties of the composition. In said fonmula, RI and R2 are as delineated above and b has a value of from zero to three, inclusive.Examples of suitable silanes include propyl orthosilicate, ethyl orthosilicate, ethyl polysilicate, methyltrimethoxy silane, cellosolve orthosilicate, dimethyldimethoxy silane and trimethy thoxy silane. The moisture curing compositions of this invention are useful as coating compositions, sealing compositions and encapsulating compositions. A preferred use for the compositions of this invention is as a coating composition as further delineated below. In a third aspect, the present invention relates to a method comprising i applying to a substrate a liquid composition which cures to a non liquid composition when exposed to moisture, said liquid composition being prepared by mixing, under substantially anhydrous conditions, components comprising A an organopolysiloxane fluid comprising at least two silicon bonded, alkoxysilylorganic radicals having the formula QSiRa1 OR2 3 a wherein Q denotes a divalent organic radical bonded to silicon atoms by silicon carbon bonds,R1 denotes a monovalent hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R2 denotes a methyl, ethyl, propyl or methoxyethyl radical and a has a value of 0 or 1, and B a metal ester, soluble in said liquid composition, selected from the group consisting of titanium esters, zirconium esters, hafnium esters and vanadium oxide esters the amounts of components A and B being sufficient to provide a tack free cure time of less than 120 seconds for the liquid composition, and ii exposing the applied liquid composition to a moisture containing environment until the applied composition has attained at least the desired amount of cure. The moisture curing compositions that are applied to a substrate in the method of this invention are those which are delineated above and claimed herein, including preferred embodiments thereof. For example, the above disclosed compositions of this invention which comprise an organopolysiloxane fluid having the formula Ia above and from 0.5 to 4.0 parts of titanium as a titanium ester are preferred for use in the method of this invention for providing a substrate with an elastomeric coating having various adhesive releasing capabilities, depending, as noted above, upon the relative number and nature of R1 radicals that are present therein.Furthermore, in order to enhance the possibility of the applied composition having a full cure time of less than 60 seconds at room temperature, it is recommended that the titanium be present as tetraisopropyl titanate or a partial hydrolyzate, methanolate or ethanolate thereof. As another example, the above disclosed compositions of this invention which comprise an organopolysiloxane fluid having the formulae Ib e above and from 1.5 to 2.5 parts of titanium as tetraisopropyl titanate or a partial hydrolyzate, methanolate or ethanolate thereof are preferred for use in the method of this invention for rapidly coating a paper substrate with an adhesive releasing coating. By rapidly coating, it is meant in this case that a period of less than 30 seconds is required to cure the applied composition to a no smear, no migration, no rub off condition, as further described below. As noted above, any liquid composition of this invention has a cure time which depends, to various degrees, upon the amount of time that elapses between mixing the composition and exposing the composition to moisture. This characteristic must be taken into consideration when practising the method of this invention, particularly when it is desired that the method of this invention provide a substrate with a cured organopolysiloxane coating within 60 seconds, and preferably within 30 seconds, at room temperature. More particularly, when a composition of this invention is prepared with a highly reactive titanium ester, such as tetraisopropyl titanate, it should be applied to a substrate and exposed to moisture within a period of less than 5 minutes after being prepared if a rapid curing of the applied composition at room temperature is desired. Preferably, the composition to be applied in the method of this invention is prepared with a partial hydrolyzate, ethanolate or ethanolate of tetraisopropyl titanate, delineated above. As noted above, such a compdsition can be held, under anhydrous conditions, for up to 2 hours after being prepared without experiencing a significant increase in cure time. Of course, if a longer cure time can be tolerated or a higher curing temperature can be used, the compositions of this invention can be held for a period of several hours after their preparation, if desired, before being exposed to moisture. In the process of this invention, the composition to be applied to a substrate must be maintained under substantially anhydrous conditions until at least shortly before, such as a few seconds before, it is applied to the substrate. Preferably, the composition is kept under anhydrous conditions until it is applied, and most preferably, until after it has been applied to a substrate. Thereafter, the applied composition can be exposed to moisture when curing thereof is desired. The compositions of this invention should be applied to a substrate as a thin coating, such as less than 50 mils, preferably less than 5 mils and most preferably less than 0.5 mils, in thickness if a rapid curing thereof is desired. Since the curing process appears to involve the diffusion of water into the composition, thick coatings require longer cure times than thin coatings. Although the liquid composition can be applied to a substrate by any desired method, such as brushing, spreading, flowing, extruding, rolling or spraying, proper consideration must be made of the need for maintaining the above stated anhydrous conditions until at least shortly before the composition is to be applied. For example, in a spraying method of application comprising the use of a gaseous medium to form and apply an aerosol of the liquid composition, the liquid composition should be maintained under anhydrous conditions at least until the aerosol is formed. As another example, in a brushing, rolling or spreading method of application, the liquid composition and those portions of brushes, roller and spreaders that are in contact therewith should be maintained under anhydrous conditions.An example of a method of application to a flexible sheet material which is particularly useful in the method of this invention is disclosed in an application for U.S. patent by Brown et al., entitled Dual Web Coating Method and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Said application, filed on October 18, 1982 and having U.S.S.N. 434,813, shows a method for applying the compositions of this invention. The substrates to which the cdmpositions of this invention can be applied are not narrowly limited. As to composition, they can be cellulosic, such as paper or wood siliceous, such as concrete, brick, granite, glass, ceramic or mortar polymeric, such as polyolefin, polyamide, polyester, polycarbonate or polyacrylate metallic, such as steel, iron, copper, aluminum or silver and of animal or plant origin, such as leather and wool.As to form, they can be in fiber, filament, sheet, film, woven, flat, convoluted and composite form. However, due to the rapid curing that takes place when the compositions of this invention are exposed to moisture t substrates which can be rapidly moved past, and be coated by, a stationary source of the coating composition, maintained under anhydrous conditions, and then be exposed to a controlled environment with respect to humidity and tewperature are preferred substrates for the process of this invention. Preferred substrates include flexible sheet material, such as paper and fiber material, such as optical fibers, which can be rapidly moved through a reservoir of the fresh coating composition, maintained under anhydrous conditions, and then moved into a curing chamber, preferably having a controlled moisture content, such as 50 and controlled temperature, such as 400C, said moisture content and temperature being more controllable than room conditions. After the liquid composition has been applied to the substrate, it is exposed to a moisture containing environment, preferably immediately and continuously, until it cures to the extent desired, typically to a non liquid state that is sufficiently rigid to permit further handling of the coated substrate. For example, in the paper coating art, wherein the paper is typically coated on one side and stored in roll form until being processed further the applied composition need only be cured sufficiently to the dry, solid state to permit rolling of the coated paper further curing in the roll being permissible without undesirable consequences.In the fiber coating art, wherein the fiber is typically coated completely and stored in spool form until being processed further, the applied composition should be cured sufficiently to prevent adhesion of the spooled fibers due to continued curing of the coating while in intimate contact. In a preferred embodiment of the method of this invention, wherein a liquid composition of this invention is applied to a flexible sheet material, the viscosity of the liquid composition preferably has a value of from 300 to 5000 centipoise at 250C. Such a composition, properly formulated to have a sufficient amount of tetraisopropyl titanate as delineated herein and applied to a paper substrate at a coating weight of approximately 1 pound per ream, reacts with moisture so rapidly that it uses moisture in the paper, as well as in the atmosphere, to form a cured, adherent film at the paper composition interface berore the liquid composition can soak into the paper to any appreciable extent.A beneficial result of this invention is thus the possibility to use less coating composition andbof more porous substrates in the paper coating art than previously required. The following examples are disclosed to further teach how to practise the present invention in its three aspects but not to limit said invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Tack free cure time of a curable composition was measured by applying the composition, 1 8 inch thick, on a polyethylene coated surface and exposing the applied composition to an atmosphere having a relative humidity of 50j 4 at 77 2 F. The time that elapses from exposure to moisture until a 1 x 8 inch strip of 3 mil polyethylene, applied to the surface of the exposed composition for 4 seconds under a force of 0.5 oz in.2, can be cleanly removed therefrana was noted as tack free cure time. For any given coqosition tack free cure time is never more than full cure time, described below. Full cure time of a curable composition was measured by applying the composition to super calendaredS2S kraft paper at a coating weight of 1 pound ream using a laboratory blade coater and exposing the applied composition to an atmosphere having a relative humidity of 50 4 at 77i20F. The time required from exposure to moisture until the applied composition cured to the no smear, no rub off, no migration state was noted as the full cure time. For any given composition, full cure time is never less than tack free cure time, described above. The smear of a coating was measured by lightly rubbing the coating with a finger and looking for hazing of the coating. The degree of haze none, very slight, slight, moderate, gross that was observed indicated the degree of smear of the coating. A fully cured coating demonstrates no smear. The rub off of a coating was measured by vigorously rubbing the coating with the index finger tip, trying to remove the coating from the paper. The extent of rub off was described as none, very slight, slight, moderate or gross. A fully cured coating demonstrates no rub off. Migration of a coating was measured by placing a test strip of No. 5910 3M8 St. Paul, Minnesota brand transparent tape on the coating, adhesive bearing surface in contact with the coating, and rubbing the strip 5 to 20 times with a finger to adhere it to the coating. The strip of transparent tape was then removed from the coating and its adhesive bearing surface was doubled, end to end, onto itself and pressed firmly together. The force needed to separate the doubled test strip was approximately the same as the force needed to separate a doubled strip of fresh tape for a coating having no migration. Other ratings include very slight, slight, moderate and gross migration. A fully cured coating demonstrates no migration. Adhesive release for a coating was measured on a fully cured coating that further had been aged for 24 hours at room temperature. Each cured coating was prepared for release testing according to the following procedure. The cured coating was coated with adhesive using either a solution of MonsantoS St. Louis, Missouri GMS 263 acrylic adhesive hereinafter Acrylic or National StarchS NewYork, New York 36 6045 styrene butadiene rubber adhesive hereinafter SBR . The adhesive solution was applied to the cured coating at a wet thickness of 3 mils 76.2 Vm using a draw down bar. The applied adhesive was air dried at room temperature for one minute, heated at 700C. for one minute and then cooled to room temperature again for 1 minute.A sheet of 60 pound matte litho was applied to the dried adhesive and the resulting laminate was rolled with a 4.5 pound rubber coated roller and aged at 70 C. Release testing of the laminates was accomplished by cooling the aged laminates to room temperature, cutting the cooled laminates into 1 inch 25.4 mm strips and pulling the matte adhesive laminate from the kraft paper coating laminate at an angle of 1800 wradians at 400 inches minute 0.17 m s . The force, in grams per inch, that was required to separate the laminate was noted as adhesive release. This value was converted to newtons per meter elm for this disclosure by multiplying by Q.3860885 in.N g.m and rounding off to three significant figures.Example 1 A pclydimethyl co methylhydrogensiloxane having the average formula HMe2SiO Me2SiO 142 MeHSiO 3SiMe2H was prepared by heating the following mixture of reactants at 750C for 4 hours HMe2Si 2O,l.34 parts MeRSiOtc, 1.80 parts c 3 Ne2SiO c 105.08 parts ic 3 CF3SO3H, 0.03 parts. The reaction mixture was cooled, neutralized and filtered to provide a fluid siloxane having a viscosity at 250C of 259 cs. r a specific gravity at 250C of 0.968 and a SiH content of 0.044 . Several organopolysiloxanes of this invention were prepared by mixing, under anhydrous conditions, 500 parts of the above described polydimethyl co methyl hydrogensiloxane with a sufficient amount of various vinylalkoxysilanes to react with 110 of the siliconbonded hydrogen atoms therein and 70 parts per million based on the siloxane, of a platinum containing catalyst.The mixtures were allowed to stand at room temperature until substantially all of the silicon bonded hydrogen atoms had reacted with vinyl alkoxysilane. Table I. The organopolysiloxanes shown in Table I and their associated unreacted vinylalkoxysilane were mixed, in the absence of moisture, with partially hydrolyzed tetraisopropyl titanate, to produce liquid, curable compositions of this invention which contained 90 percent siloxane and 10 percent titanate. The cure times tack free and full were measured as noted above and are listed in Table I. A titanium concentration of 1.87 parts per 100 parts of organopolysiloxane was used in this example.Example 2 A 10 excess of an organotrimethoxy silane having the formula CH2 C CH3 CO2 CH2 3Si OMe 3 was reacted with the polydimethyl co methylhydrogensiloxane described in Example 1 to prepare an organopolysiloxane of this invention having the formula RMe2SiO Me2SiO 142fMeRSiO 3 SiMe2R wherein R denotes CH2CH CH3 CO2 CH2 3Si OMe 3.The organopolysiloxane was mixed under anhydrous conditions with partially hydrolyzed tetraisopropyl titanate to produce a curable composition of this invention which contained 90 percent organopolysiloxane and associated unreacted organotrimethoxysilane and 10 percent titanate. Paper was coated with this curable composition according to the method of this invention and a full cure time of 45 seconds was noted therefor.Example 3 An organopolysiloxane having the structure ViMe2SiO Me2SiO 145 MeViSiO 3SiMe2Vi, 200 parts, was mixed at room temperature with 17.2 parts of HSCH2CH2CH2Si OMe 3 and 0.2 part of a mineral oil solution of ferric octoate 6 Fe . The mixture was stirred for one hour then pressure filtered to give an organopolysiloxane bearing cH 2cH2SCH2cH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals.One hundred parts of this organopolysiloxane was mixed with 6.4 parts of a partial hydrolyzate of tetraisopropyl titanate 1.1 parts of titanium and the resulting composition of this invention was found to have a full cure time of 60 seconds at 23 C. when this experiment was repeated with 8.7, 11.1 and 13,6 parts of the titanate 1.5, 1.87 and 2.29 parts of titanium full cure times of 27, 20 and 17 seconds were measured. The four cured coatings released acrylic adhesive GMs 263 with a force of 45 to 55 g in. 17.4 to 21.2 N rn and rubber adhesive SBR 6045 with a force of 21 to 26 g in. 8.1 to 10.0 N m . Example 4 This example illustrates the need for high levels of titanium ester to get rapid cure when the organopolysiloxane contains only 2 alkoxysilylorganic radicals. An organopolysiloxane having the formulaRMe2SiO Me2SiO 250 25QSiMe,R rrhere R denotes CH2CH2Si OMe 3 was prepared by a hydrosilylation reaction ofCH2 CHSi OMe 2 with HMeSiO Me2SiO 250SiMe2H as described in Example 1. One hundred parts of the organopolysiloxane were mixed with 17 parts of mixture of 80 TPT tetraisopropyl titanate and 20 dry methanol. The resulting composition of this invention had 2.3 parts of titanium in the form of partially methanolized TPT and a full cure time of 30 seconds.The resulting cured coating released acrylic adhesive GMS 263 with a force of 18.1 Nfm after no aging and 88.4 N m after aging at 700C for 2 weeks. When the experiment was repeated with 5.2 parts of the mixture of partially methanolized titanium ester 0.88 parts of titanium instead of 17 parts, a full cure time of 1500 seconds was measured.Example 5 Two linear organopolysiloxanes having an average of 100 dimethyl siloxane units and two CH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals were prepared, one having the CH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals on the ends of the polydimethylsiloxane chain and the other having the CH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals randomly spaced along the polydimethylsiloxane chain in place of methyl radicals which was therefore endblocked with trimethylsiloxane units. When mixed with approximately 8.7 parts 100 parts organopolysiloxane of the partially methanolized titanium ester of Example 4 1.5 parts of titanium , the resulting compositions had a full cure time of 210 seconds and 1088 seconds respectively. This example illustrates the effect of terminal alkoxysilylorganic groups in providing a more rapid cure rate. Compare also Example 6.Example 6 Two linear organopolysiloxanes having an average of 100 dimethylsiloxane units and 7 CH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals were prepared, one having CH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals on both ends of the polydimethylsiloxane chain and the other having methyl radicals on the ends of the polydimethylsiloxane chain, the remaining CH2CH2Si OMe 3 radicals in each case being randomly spaced along the polydimethylsiloxane chain in place of methyl radicals.When mixed with approximately 8.7 parts 100 parts of organopolysiloxane of the partially methanolized titanium ester of Example 4 10.9 parts of the mixture of TPT andMeOH and 1.5 parts of titanium , the resulting compositions had a full cure time of 30 and 90 seconds, respectively.This example illustrates the effect of terminal alkoxysilylorganic groups for providing a more rapid cure rate. Compare also Example 5.Example 7 Two organopolysiloxanes of this invention having the formula RMe2SiO Me2SiO x MeRSiO ySiMe2R were prepared wherein R denotes CH2CH2Si OMe 3 one with x 390 y 10 and the other with x 238 y 12. Four liquid compositions of this invention were prepared by mixing either 5.2 parts or 17 parts of the 80 20 mixture of TPT NeoB that is described in Example 4 to provide either 4.2 parts or 13.6 parts of partially methanolized titanium ester and either 0.7 or 2.3 parts of titanium for every 100 parts of organopolysiloxane. The four curable compositions were applied to paper and became fully cured within 120 seconds when exposed to moisture. Example 8 A rapidly curing composition of this invention was prepared by mixing, under anhydrous conditions, 100 parts of an organopolysiloxane having the formula Ne3SiO Ne2SiO 242 NeR SiOX6SiMe3 wherein R denotes cH2CH2Si OKe and 17 parts of the mixture of TPT and MeOB in Example 4. The resulting mixture had 13.6 parts of partially methanolized titanium ester and 2.3 parts of titanium for every 100 parts of organopolysiloxane. The resulting curable composition was applied to paper and exposed to moisture. A full cure was obtained in 20 seconds. The resulting cured coating released acrylic adhesive with a force of 58 g in. 22.4 N m after no aging and 95 grin. 36.7 NIm after 2 weeks at 700C.Corresponding values for SBR adhesive were 55 g in. 21.2 N ni in each case. Example 9 When 100 parts of an organopolysiloxane having the formula RMe2SiO Me2SiO 242 MeRSiO 6SiMe2R, where R denotes CH2CH2Si OMe 3, were mixed under substantially anhydrous conditions with from 1 to 10 parts of either TPT 0.17 to 1.7 parts of titanium or di isopropoxy di ethylacetoacetoxy titanium TDIDE 0.12 to 1.2 parts of titanium , compositions having a tack free cure time of less than 120 seconds were obtained.Example 10 Five compositions were prepared by mixing, under substantially anhydrous conditions, 100 parts of an organopolysiloxane having the formula Me3SiO Me2SiO x MeRSiO wherein y 3 wherein R denotes CH2CH2Si OMe 3, x had a value of 213 and Z had a value of 12 and either 11.1, 8.7, 6.4, 4.2 or 2.0 parts of the titanate methanol mixture disclosed inExample 4 1.5, 1.2, 0.86, 0.57 and 0.27 parts of titanium . Only the compositions containing 1.5, 1.2 and 0.86 parts of titanium had a full cure time of 30 seconds or less at 250C. Heating these applied coatings to 600C reduced their full cure time to 5 seconds or less. The composition containing 0.57 parts of titanium had to be heated to 800C to have a full cure time of 20 seconds.The composition containing 0.27 parts of titanium would not fully cure in less than 30 seconds, even when heated to 1200C.Example 11 The composition of Example 10 having 1.5 parts of titanium was applied to various substrates using a blade coater at a blade pressure of 20 p.s.i. After 5 seconds of exposure to moisture at room temperature, each applied coating was examined for cure. In each case, the coating was cured with respect to the smear test and to the migration test, and also with respect to the rub off test when the substrate was corona treated polyester, corona treated polypropylene, kraft paper or coronatreated polyethylene. However, the coating did not pass the rub off test when the substrate was untreated polyethylene, untreated polypropylene or polyester film.Example 12 This example illustrates the effect of the age of a composition of this invention on its cure rate. The composition that was used in Example 11 was prepared and coated onto kraft paper immediately, after 30 minutes and after 60 minutes and the applied composition was immediately exposed to moisture in each case. The time required for the coated composition to reach a full cure was noted to be 5 seconds, 5 seconds and 10 seconds, respectively When the above composition was prepared using 11.1 parts of fresh tetraisopropyl titanate and the resulting composition was coated onto kraft paper immediately, after 5 minutes and after 10 minutes and exposed to moisture immediately thereafter, full cure times of 5 seconds, 20 seconds and 60 seconds, respectivelywere noted.Example 13 The organopolysiloxane used in the experiment ofExample 1O was mixed with 11.11 or 5.26 or 2.56 parts of OV C3H7 3 per 100 parts of the organopolysiloxane 2.3, 1.1 or 0.5 parts of vanadium, respectively . All three compositions had a full cure time of 30 seconds or less at 25QC. Example 14 Example 13 was repeated except that 9.00 parts of tetrapropyl zirconate or 11.11 parts of tetrapropyl titanate or 6.78 parts of triisopropoxy vanadium oxde was used instead of the stated amounts OV OC3H7 3. Tack free times of 18 seconds, 12 seconds and 35 seconds respectively were noted.
