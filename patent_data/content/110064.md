# Heat resistant light alloy articles and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
Light alloy articles comprising a body 1 of light alloy having a composite layer 2 of heat resistant fibers and light alloy and bonded to said body, and a surface layer 3 of heat resisting alloy sprayed onto said composite layer 2 exhibit improved integrity and heat resistance when the heat resisting alloy is plasma sprayed onto one surface of a preform of fibers and the light alloy is then cast to the opposite surface of the preform such that an interfacial layer 4 is defined between the composite layer 2 and the sur face layer 3 in which the fibers and light alloy are integrally incorporated with the heat resisting alloy.
