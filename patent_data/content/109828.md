# Method and apparatus for separating particulate materials.

## Abstract
Particles having different properties e.g. particulate fly ash and carbon are separated by driving the particles by means of a vibratory feeder 12 forwards along a horizontal electrode plate 1 above which is mounted a second electrode 2 having at least one plate 4 mounted at an acute angle Î± to the horizontal. Preferably, two plates 4 each extend sideways from a central block 3 of dielectric material. An alternating electric field is generated between the electrodes 1, 2 by a high voltage AC power source 14 . The potential across each plate 4 varies in particular, decreases in the lateral direction, the variation being continuous or stepwise. The field lines 16 from each plate 4 curve to the side and impart centrifugal forces to particles charged by friction or conductive induction, which forces separate lighter, more heavily charged particles from the others. The separated particles are collected in bins 13 arranged around the lower electrode 1 .
