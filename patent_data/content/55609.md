## Description
COMPOSITION FOR COMLORIC ADMINISTRATION, ITS PREPARATION, AND INCREDENTS FOR USE THEREIN The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for coelomic administration and its preparation.More particularly, it relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, which is suitable for administration through a body cavity, and a process for preparing the same. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are known as antimicrobial agents. It is also well known that the combined use of them within a certain proportion ranges produces a synergistic effect in antimicrobial activity U.S. patent 3,341,541 . Thus, the combination of sulfamethoxaztle and trimethoprim in a weight proportion of 5 1 is normally used, although a higher sulfamethoxazole proportion is practically usable. In fact, tablets comprising 400 mg of sulfamethoxazole and 80 mg of trimethoprim per each tablet are on the clinical use with an ordinary dose of two tablets twice a day. This corresponds to the administration of 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg of trimethoprim each time. Since the said tablets contain a relatively great amount of the active ingredients, their size are obliged to be large. This causes difficulty on the oral administration. Further, they sometimes cause a damage to a principal absorption organs such as stomach or duodenum. In order to avoid the above difficulty, it was frequently tried to administer the active ingredients through a body cavity such as rectum. From the practical viewpoint, however, the following drawbacks are seen on the realization of such coelomic administration 1 In the manufacture of a preparation suitable for coelomic administration, the viscosity of a mixture of the active ingredients and a base material s at the mixing step is abnormally elevated to solidify, and the resulting mixture is hardly molded into a desired shape 2 The preparation as manufactured changes remarkably in various physical properties such as disintegrating property, dissolving property and melting property, and in particular, the disintegration is unfavorably delayed. 3 Even immediately after the manufacture, the preparation can hardly produce desired blood levels of the active ingredients. Various proposals have been made to overcome the above drawbacks. For instance, German OffenlegungsschriftNo. 2,415,660 proposes a suppository preparation comprising a portion containing sulfamethoxazole alone and a portion containing trimethoprim alone, optionally with any separation layer between them. This proposal overcomes the difficulty on the manufacture to a certain extent but is disadvantageous in requiring two or three stages for molding. Further, for instance, Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 102,517 80 proposes a preparation for coelomic administration using a complex of sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim as disclosed in Japanese patent 805,379 Japanese Patent Publication examined No. 20125 75 . As a result of the subsequent study for overcoming the solidification at the step for mixing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim as the active ingredients with a base material s , it has now been found that the presence of a small amount of a phospholipid in the mixing system is effective in prevention of such solidification. Advantageously, the phospholipid can solve simultaneously the problem of delay in disintegration. It has also been found that the use of trimethoprim in its salt or the incorporation of an organic acid into the mixture can promote the absorption of trimethoprim, its own absorption rate being somewhat smaller than that of sulfamethoxazole.The present invention is based on the above findings. Accordinglyr a basic object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, which is suitable for coelomic administration. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, which can be prepared while preventing the solidification at the step for mixing of the active ingredients with a base material s . A further object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, wherein the absorption of trimethoprim is improved without affording any unfavorahle influence on the absorption of sulfamethoxazole. According to the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition for coelomic administration comprising sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with a base material s , and having a phospholipid included therein so that the tendency of solidification at the step for mixing the said components in the manufacture of the said composition is preventedt whereby the said comtosition can be molded into any desired shape suitable for coelomic administration without any difficulty.Advantageously, the inclusion of the phospholipid can solve at the same time the problem of the delayed disintegration. The term pharmaceutical or veterinary composition for coelomic administration is intended to mean any pharmaceutical composition which is formulated in any preparation suitable for administration through a body cavity. It is usually manufactured as a suppository preparation, which maintains a solid state at room temperature and is readily melted in a body cavity. It may be also manufactured in the form of ointment of liquid, which can be filled in a soft capsule for administration. The term sulfamethoxazole as one of the active ingredients in the composition of the invention covers not only sulfamethoxazole itself but also its derivatives which are considered to exert an antimicrobial activity substantially in the form of sulfamethoxazole in a living body. Examples of such derivatives are acetylsulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxazole sodium, etc. Likewise, the term trimethoprim as the other active ingredient covers not only trimethoprim itself but also its derivatives which are considered to exert an antimicrobial activity substantially in the form of trimethoprim in a living body. Examples of such derivatives are organic and inorganic salts of trimethoprim such as hydrochloride, sulfate, citrate, lactate, tartrate, malate and maleate. In this connection, it should be noted that the incorporation of trimethoprim in its salt form into the composition of the invention can promote the absorption of trimethoprim. Alternatively, trimethoprim or its salt may be incorporated into the composition with any organic acid e.g. lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid so that the absorption rate of trimethoprim can be increased. When the organic acid is incorporated, its amount may be usually from about 0.1 to 4 by weight based on the weight of the composition. In the composition of the invention, the weight proportion of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim as the active ingredients may be usually from about 1 1 to 10 1. The composition of the invention may be administered in such an amount as providing from about 1 to 50 mg of sulfamethoxazole and from about 1 to 5 mg of trimethoprim per kg of the body weight for a single dose. The interval of administration is usually from about 12 to 18 hours. As the phospholipid, there may be used any phospholipid obtained from plant seeds such as soybean, eggs, livers of animals such as cows and pigs, etc.Synthetic ones are also usable. Specific examples are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelins, dipalmitoyllecithin, etc. These may be employed alone or in combination. The amount of the phospholipid to be used may be from about 0.5 to 5 by weight based on the weight of the composition. When the amount is less than the said lower limit, the desired solidification preventing effect is not exerted. When the amount is more than the said upper limit, the viscosity of the composition is lowered. Thus, the composition becomes sticky so that its molding into an appropriate shape is quite difficult. In addition, the quality of the composition is much deteriorated. As the base material s , there may be used any physiologically accepable carrier or diluent conventionally employed for preparation of ointments or suppositories.Examples of the base material s are oils and fats e.g.peanut oil, plam oil, olive oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cotton seed oil, castor oil, linseed oil, rice bran oil, rape oil, corn oil, cacao butter, beef tallow, lanolin , their hydrogenated products, their modified products with exchange of fatty acids or acetylation, their glycerides, etc. There are also usable water miscible base materials such as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerogelatin, methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose. In order to accelerate the absorption of the active ingredients, any surfactant which exerts only a mild action to mucous membranes may be incorporated in the composition of the invention. The surfactant may be any of nonionic, cationic, anionic and amphoionic types. Specific examples are polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene higher alcohol esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene alkylamines, polyoxyethylene alkylamides, polyether alcohol sulfates, alkyl sulfates, etc. When desired, the composition of the invention may further include any other additive such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, coloring agents, etc. As to the order of incorporation of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and the phospholipid with or without an organic acid into a base material s , there is no particular limitation. Thus, they may be mixed together in any optional order. Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the invention are illustratively shown in the followingExamples wherein part s are by weight.
