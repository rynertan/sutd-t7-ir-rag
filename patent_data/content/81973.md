## Description
POLYMER COMPRISING MERS OF ESTERS AND USE THEREOF INCOATING COMPOSITIONS, BINDERS OR ADHESIVES ESTERSAND USE THEREOF AS MONOMERS, REACTIVE DILUENTS,MODIFIERS OR CROSSLINKERS This invention concerns polymer comprising mers of esters and the use thereof as or in coating compositions, binders or adhesives esters and the use thereof as monomers, reactive diluents, modifiers or crosslinkers. The invention more specifically concerns esters of ss acryloxy propionic acid and other Michael addition homopolymers of acrylic acid, polymers of such esters and applications for the esters and polymers, such as in formulations for coatings, binders and adhesives.The esters of vinyl addition monomers, many of which are particularly adapted for use as reactive diluents, modifiers and crosslinkers in compositions comprising polymeric materials, are especially useful in systems cured by radiation or autoxidation. Preparation of the homopolymer of acrylic acid has been described in Polymer Letters Edition, Volume 14, pages 277 281, 1976 Macromolecules, Volume 7, pages 256 258, 1974 U.S. Patent 3,888,912 and European Patent 3045. The European Patent and U.S. Patent 4,048,259 disclose the use of the homopolymer aci9 in adhesives and U.S. Patents 3,266,930 and 4,048,259 disclose its use in coatings. U.S. Patent 3,868,410 t es the recovery of acrylic acid, an alkanol and an alkyl acrylate from an alkyl ester of the acrylic acid Michael addition homopolymer. In the interests of reducing pollution it is desirable to develop reactive diluents in coating compositions. Ideally, these diluents are high boiling i.e. essentially nonvolatile , low viscosity monomers that function as solvents for polymeric constituents during application but can subsequently be induced to polymerize, i.e. can undergo a curing process of some kind, thus becoming an integral part of the final product. Pollution by conventional solvents are thereby reduced or eliminated. There is also a desire, in such coating systems, for multifunctional monomers, with similar physical characteristics, that can function as crosslinkers providing desirable coating properties, especially mechanical and resistanceproperties.Unfortunately, many reactive diluents and crosslinkers currently in use suffer significant disadvantages 1 excessive volatility n use, 2 undesirable handling characteristics i.e poor solubility in or compatibility with common polymeric materials, crystallinity, high viscosity, etc. or 3 toxicity. The esters of the invention are particularly useful as reactive diluents, modifiers and crosslinkers when admixed with other polymeric materials They can be lower in volatility and surprisingly lower in toxicity than acrylate analogues while still retaining desirable viscosity and reactivity properties. The esters of the homopolymers of acrylic acid hereinafter referred to as AOnPA , such esters being referred to as AOnPAtes may be more hydrophobic than the corresponding acrylates and thus more compatible with many conventional polymers and formulations in, for example, coatings, binders and adhesives. This invention embraces the preparation, properties and uses of addition homopolymers and copolymers of esters of AOnPA and an alcohol. The invention also embraces the preparation, properties and uses of monomers which are esters of AOnPA and an alcohol other than a C1 to C10 alkyl monohydroxylate. AOnPA is used herein to mean more than one acid represented by CH2 CHCO 2 CH2CH2CO2 nH I wherein the average value of n, n, is 0.1 or greater.In the copolymer, the alcohol can be any monohydroxyl alcohol, preferably it has other functionality such as aromaticity, other unsaturation, atoms other than carbon and hydrogen, or even a long hydrocarbon chain such as is common in surfactant molecule The invention embraces processes for preparing the polymers, and the use of the polymers in the preparation of coatings, binders, adhesives and rigid plastic articles. TheAOnPA ester monomers are useful as monomers in forming homopolymers and copolymers, particularly as modifiers, reactive diluents and crosslinkers when used in conjunction with other polymers.Where the alcohol is a polyol and more than one hydroxyl function is esterified by OAnPA, the ester is a vinyl addition crosslinking monomer and 1 other polymers with appropriate functionality can be crosslinked to a polymer network or 2 the AOnPA ester alone can be crosslinked to a polymer network. The a,3 ethylenically unsaturated acids of the ester monomers of this invention, are represented by the formula CH2 CHCO2 CH2CH2C02 H, wherein the average value of n, n, is 0.1 or greater, preferably between about 0.4 and about 10 and more preferably between about 0.9 and about 5. These acids are prepared conveniently by the Michael addition reaction of acrylic acid to itself, the degree of addition determining the value of n. As is the case with most polymers, the degree of polymerization is conveniently characterized by the average value of n samples of the polymer will normally have a low degree of polymerization and are thus properly described as oligomers.These oligomers consist of mixtures of individual molecules defined by the above chemical formula when individual molecules are being denoted, n must have integral values. When n is 0, the structure is acrylic acid, which is well known as are its esters.The acid molecule where n equals 1 is also known as ss acryloxypropionic acid. This acid, when pure, is represented by Formula I with n 1, for the value of n for every molecule in this sample is 1 thus the average value is also 1. Materials other than acrylic acid may be used to prepare the AOnPA for making the esters and polymers of this invention, but the preparation starting with acrylic acid is preferred and the use ofAOnPA as the intermediate is also preferred. It is known that samples of acrylic acid spontaneously undergo theMichael addition reaction to a small degree so that, after standing for a protracted period, they contain traces of AOnPA. It is recognized that n is the number average degree of polymerization. The polymers of this invention are polymers comprising mers of esters of AOnPA and any alcohol, and may comprise mers of ester monomers of this invention.The ester monomers of this invention are preferably esters of AOnPA and a functional alcohol. A functional alcohol is an alcohol having a functional group such as a functional hydrocarbyl group e.g., an alkylaryl, aralkyl, surfactant alkyl, ethylenically unsaturated, acetylenicallyunsaturated group or a non hydrocarbyl functional group including an ether, ester, halogen, amine, acid, aldehyde, ketone, amide1 urea, hydantoin, imide, quaternary ammonium or another hydroxyl group. Preferably the functional alcohol is an ester alcohol or an unsaturated alcohol.A surfactant alkyl group is a group having twelve or more carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and most preferably a linear chain of 12 to 18 carbon atoms As used in the specification and or claims the term ester forming derivative thereof is intended to include ester forming derivatives of the acid represented by the formula and ester forming derivat,ives of the alcohol s One preferred embodiment is that in which the alcohol is also an ester of an alpha ,ss unsaturated acid other than AOnPA, such as, and preferably, acrylic or methacrylic acid. This monomer has two unsaturated groups and thus is adapted to serve as a crosslinking monomer.Ester monomers wtth another functional group may also serve as a crosslinking monomer. Those with allyl, hydroxyl vinyl, carboxy, amide such as alkylol amide or alkoxyalkyl amide and the like urea and hydantoin , amine, halogen, aldehyde, ketone, imide, hydrazide and quaternary ammonium functionality can all serve as crosslinkers via well known condensation crosslinking, ionic cross linking and other addi tion crosslinking reactions . Preferred other functional groups are hydroxy, carboxy, amine, amide, aldehyde and ketone groups. Such groups can be introduced into AOnPA or AOnPAte homopolymers and copolymers by well known postpolymerization functionalization reactions.Preferred other coreactants usefulfor reacting with theAOnPAte monomers are polyfunctional epoxides, isocyanates, formaldehyde condensates including melamines, ureas and phenolics, polyamines, polyhydrazides, polythiols, Michael reaction acceptors, titanates and the various silicon based coreactants, all familiar to those skilled in polymer chemistry. In another preferred embodiment, the ester is a monoester of AOnPA wherein the alcohol is a polyol thus the ester has both ethylenic unsaturation and a hydroxyl functional group. The ester may also have other functional groups as in the alcohols above. Thus the ester can be incorporated in an addition polymer by means of the ethylenic group and be crosslinked by means of the hydroxyl or the other functional group. Preferably the polyol is a hydrocarbenyl diol and most preferably the hydrocarbenyl group is ethylenyl or propylenyl. In another embodiment, the ester is a polyester ofAOnPA and a polyol. The polyol can have other functional groups as described in the alcohols above. Being a polyester of an ethylenically unsaturated acid, it is peculiarly adapted to serve as an addition polymerizable crosslinker. A preferred embodiment is one in which the polyol is a polyhydroxyl substituted hydrocarbon such as ethylene glycol 1,3 butylene glycol, neopentyl glycol,l,4 butanediol, or propylene glycol, and especially where the ester is a diester. In a related embodiment, the ester is an addition product of AOnPA and an epoxide, such as one of the bisphenol A epoxides or an epoxidized oil the product being a hydroxyl functional AOnPAte. In another embodiment the polyol is trimethylol propane and the ester is a diester or, preferably, a triester. A general chemical formula for the vinyl addition monomer AOnPAte of this invention is ETCH2 CHCO2 CH2CH2CO2 nzX wherein the average value of n is 0.1 or greater, Y is the residue of an alcohol other than a C1 to C10 monohydroxylate having z hydroxyl groups, where z is 1 the alcohol may have one other functional group, z being a positive integer, and the average value of x being greater than 0 but not greater than z. The polymer of this invention is a homopolymer or copolymer of an AOnPAte or of any other ester of AOnPA and an alcohol. Although we do not wish to be bound by any of the following speculative comments, they are made to assist the reader in understanding certain features of the invention and its objectives In many cases, acrylates and methacrylates offer what appear to be simpler routes to the type of functionality achievable with the AOnPAtes of this invention. However, among the differences, it is found that the AOnPAtes provide harder and more resistant films as in Examples 27 and 28 below. Further, a trimethylolpropane tris AOnPAte can be used as a sole component topcoat for a soft substrate such as paper and the resulting cured paper may be less brittle than the material made with the corresponding acrylic analogue.This result is presumably due to the greater length along the chain between the unsaturated groups in the ester because of the flexibility associated with longer length and of less penetration into the paper substrate by the topcoat because of both the large size molecule and the greater viscosity of the AOnPAte. The AOnPAtes have lower volatility than the corresponding acrylate and methacrylate materials. Simple methods to decrease the volatility of the acrylics such as by the introduction of alkoxyether units between the alcohol and the acid gives materials with the undesirable properties of the ether units similar situations exist with other materials such as thioethers, amides and amines. The ether and the other units. bind water more strongly than the ester linkage in the AOnPAte, and thus can be expected to be more water sensitive.The polarity or hydrogen bonding capacity which lead to the water swellability also lead to increasing sensitivity to various types of solvents particularly socalled strong solvents. Under appropriate strongly alkaline or strongly acidic conditions AOnPAtes may hydrolyze more readily than corresponding acrylate and methacrylate esters. This property has a variety of applications as in processes such as the recycling of paper comprising polymeric adjuncts, the removal of size from fabrics, removal of other temporary coatings from substrates and particularly a papermaking process step known in the art as broke recovery . Certain of the physical property differences between the AOnPAtes and the acrylates are advantageous, particularly in industrial practice. An example is the relative softness or ease of liquification of theAOnPAtes. For instance, pentaerythritol tetracrylate is a solid whereas.the tetra AOnPAte is a liquid and thus easily handled and incorporated into liquid formulations. Mono AOnPAtes Among the esters useful herein are those derived from monofunctional alcohols including linear and branched aliphatic alcohols with 1 36 carbon atoms, alicyclic aliphatic alcohols with 3 36 carbon atoms e.g.cyclohexanol , 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexanol, dicyclopentenyl alcohol, etc. , hydroxy functional aromatics e. g. phenol, naphthol, etc. and their ethoxylates or propoxylates, alcohols with alkylaryl groups e. g. benzyl alcohol, 2phenylethanol, furfurol, etc. , allylic alcohols e. g.allyl alcohol, 2 methyl 2 propen l ol, 2 allyloxyethanol, 2 2 allyloxyethoxy ethanol, 2 buten 1 ol, etc. , hydroxylfunctional ethers e. g. 2 methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, 2 butoxyethanol, 2 phenoxyethanol, 2 2 methoxyethoxy ethanol, 2 2 ethoxyethoxy ethanol, 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol, 2 2 hexoxyethoxy ethanol, the corresponding ethers derived from diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, propylene glycol or dipropylene glycol, dicyclopentenyloxyethanol, etc. hydroxyl functional esters e. g. 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and methacrylate, 2hydroxypropyl acrylate and methacrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate and methacrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate and methacrylate, ethyl 2 hydroxypropanoate, butyl 2 hydroxypropanoate, etc. , hydroxyl functional acids e. g. 12hydroxystearic acid, lactic acid, etc. , hydroxyl functional aldehydes e g. 5 hydroxypentanal, 2,2 dimethyl 3hydroxypropanal, 2 hydroxymethyl 2 methylbutanal, 2 hydroxymethyl 2 methylpentanal, 2 ethyl 2hydroxymethylhexanal, 3 hydroxy 2, 2 ,4 tr imethylpentanal, etc. , hydroxyl functional ketones e.g. 4 hydroxy 4 methyl2 pentanone,haloalcohols e. g. 2 chloroethanol, 2 bromoethanol, etc , aminoalcohols e. g. N,Ndimethylethanolamine, N 2 hydroxyethyl piperdine, etc. , Nmethylolamides, N methylolureas, N methylolhydantoins, Nmethylolimides, and the like, and N 2 hydroxyethyl or N 2 hydroxypropyl derivatives of amides, ureas, hydantoins, imides, etc. Also of use are monoesters of common polyols, especially 2 hydroxyethyl ss acryloxypropionate, 2hydroxypropyl ss acryloxypropionate, and the corresponding esters of higher oligomeric homologues of acryloxypropionic acid obtained either by direct esterification with the appropriate diols e. g. ethylene glycol or propylene glycol or, preferably, by reaction with the requisite alkylene oxides e. g. ethylene oxide or propylene oxide using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Monoesters of other diols, triols, and higher polyols are similarly useful. PoIy AOnPAtes Among the poly vinyl functional esters of use are those derived by esterification of common diols e. g.ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, 1,2 propanediol, 1,3 propanediol, dipropylene glycol, 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,3pentanediol, di hydroxyethyl and di hydroxypropyl adipate, azelate, dodecanoate, maleate and fumarate, 1,3 butanediol, 1 ,4 butaned iol, 2 buten l,4 diol, 2 butyn 1,4 diol, 1,5 pentanediol, 1,6hexanediol, 1,2 cyclohexanedimethanol, 1 ,3 cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,2 cyclohexanediol, 1,3 cyclohexanediol, 1,4 cyclohexanediol, 1,7 heptanediol, l,8 octanediol, 2 ethyl 1,3 hexanediol, 1,9 nonanediol, 1,10 decanediol, 1 ,l2 dodecanediol, 4,4 isopropylidenediphenol and its ethoxylates or propoxylates, 2,21 thiodiethanol, 3,3 thiodipropanol, N methyldiethanolamine,N ethyldiethanolamine, N butyldiethanolamine, N phenyldiethanolamine, N methylol , N 2 hydroxyethyl , or N 2 hydroxypropyl derivatives of bisamides, ureas, hydantoins, etc. , triols e. g. glycerol, 2 ethyl 2 hydroxymethyl 1,3 propanediol, l,l,l tris hydroxymethyl ethane, or their ethoxylates and propoxylates triethanolamine, N methylol , N 2 hydroxyethyl , or N 2hydroxypropyl derivatives of guanamines, melamine, cyanuric acid, etc. , tetrols e.g. pentaerythritol, N methylol , N 2 hydroxyethyl , or N 2 hydroxypropyl derivatives of quanamines, melamine, etc. , hexols e. g. dipentaerythritol, sorbitol, Nmethylol , N 2 hydroxyethyl or N 2 hydroxypropyl . derivatives of melamine, etc. , and octols e. g. tripentaerythritol . A. As ss acryloxypropionic acid and higher oligomeric homologues used in this invention can be prepared by any of a variety of methods including I Addition of acrylic acid to ss propiolactone 2 reaction of acrylic acid or acryloyl chloride with 3 hydroxypropionic acid, or 3 thermal dimerization oligomer ization of acrylic acid either with or without added catalysts. ss acryloxypropionic acid can be used admixed in varying proportions with higher oligomeric homologues.For some applications, it is advantageous to employ only the higher oligomeric. homologues. In all cases, however, the acid s used herein are of commercial grade and therefore contain small quantities of acrylic acid as an impurity unless otherwise specified. Preparation of AOnPAtes The esters of this invention can be synthesized by any of the well known procedures described in the literature including direct esterification, transesterification, acrylation of an alcohol via t he carboxylic acid chloride, anhydride, or mixed anhydrides, and, of course, other related methodologies. In direct esterification, the reaction can be effected at temperatures ranging from 200 C. to 2000 C, preferably 50 C. to 1500 C., at atmo pheric, subatmospheric, or superatmospheric pressure, in the presence of one or more acid esterification catalysts of which sulfuric acid, hycrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, para.toluenesulfonic acid, and the like, are Illustrative examples. Catalysts are generally employed at levels of 0.1 to 20 mole , preferably 0.5 to 10 mole . It is also desirable to use a vinyl polymerization inhibitor or inhibitors during the reaction, at concentrations ranging from 50 ppm to 10,000 ppm, preferably 10Q ppm to 5000 ppm, based on the weight of acid substrate. Among suitable inhibitors are hydroquinone, resorcinol, pyrocatechol, and the like, lower alkoxy substituted phenolics or lower alkylated alkoxypheriolics having up to ten carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkoxy groups e. g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone, monoethyl ether of hydroquinone, mono t butyl ether of hydroquinone, etc. alkylated hydroxyanisoles, etc. , phenothiazine, alkyl or aryl phosphites e. g. triethyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, etc. , iodine, and copper salts e.g. CuC12, CuBr2 CuSO4, Cu PO3 2, Cu NO3 2,CuO, etc. . Since the efficiency of some of the cited inhibitors is enhanced by the presence of oxygen, it is advantageous, where appropriate, to sparge air or oxygen through the reaction mixture. The esterification can be carried out with up to 90 wt. , preferably up to 50 wt. of an inert solvent which may will form an azeotrope with water generated during the reaction, thus facilitating removal of the water and displacement of the reaction equilibrium toward product.. Examples of such solvents are benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, pentane, he , heptane, octane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, trifluor m trichloroethylene, 3 methyl 2 butanone, methyl tart butyl tone, etc. The ratio of acid to alcohol used in the ester ation reaction can vary considerably, ranging, for example from 1 through 1 10, on an equivalent basis, with preferred levels ranging from 5 1 to 1 5. The reaction is continued until either all of the desired hydroxyl groups or all of the desired acid groups have been esterified as measured by standard analytical procedures.Recovery of the ester is then achieved by conventional means generally involving 1 neutralization of the catalyst and, where appropriate, excess unreacted acid, 2 physical seation of the organic phase containing the product ester, and 3 removal of solvent and or other impurities from the organic phase.As noted with the starting reactants, the product ester wi 1 be of commercial grade and should thus contain small quantit of various reaction byproducts. With monofunctional alcohols, the principal impurity will be the corresponding acrylate ester, formed either by esterification of the alcohol with resid u acrylic acid in the acid substrate or via reaction with t substrate at the internal ester function. When polyols are employed, the principal impurities will be materials with mixed acrylate and ss acryloxypropionate groups. In most applications, however, low levels of such impurities are not deleterious. As noted above, during the esterification of alcohols or polyols with AOnPA, some acrylate functional products may be formed. We speculate that this is either the result of esterification of the alcohol or polyol with acrylic acid, generated in situ by the thermally induced, acid catalyzed decomposition of AOnPA and propionyl mers or hydrolysis of AOnPA with the water of esterification, or via direct attack of the alcohol or polyol at the internal ester function of AOnPA. Thus, the propionyl mer distribution in the product may not be the same as the mer distribution in the AOnPA starting material.This phenomenon is implied in Example 1 below in which excess butyl acrylate was found in the preparation of butyl AOnPAte. Additional evidence is provided by the fact that the esterification of dodecanol with distilled AOnPA less than 1 wt. AA consistently affords 4 7 wt 5 9 mole 3 dodecyl acrylate. The addition polymers comprising AOnPAtes are made by any of the known procedures for vinyl addition polymerization sùch as bulk polymerization, solution polymerization, suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, solution and emulsion polymerization being preferred. Any addition copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a group H2C C or C C may be used for copolymerization, except those comprising primary amine groups or groups which generate primary amines under the polymerization conditions. Certain preferred polymers of AOnPAtes are copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated acids, generally in the range of about 0.2 to 20 , preferably 3 to 10 , by weight. To obtain water dispersible copolymers, about 2 to 10 acid is usually employed depending on the hydrophilic nature of the other monomers. When water solubility of the copolymer is desired about 5 to 15 or even more acid monomer is used in the copolymer7 the higher levels being needed when the remaining monomers are relatively hydrophobic.Examples of the i , ss ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids which are used in forming copolymers of the prasent invention include acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, aconitic, crotonic, citraconic, ss acryloxypropionic, ss methacryloxypropionic, maleic, fumaric, cinnamic, mesaconic, alpha chloroacrylic, and the like acids. Mixtures of these acids can also be used. The unsaturated hydrocarbon monomersawhich can be used in forming the copolymers of the present invention include ethylene, propylene, isobutene, butylene, amylene, hexylene, butadiene, isoprene and particularly. the vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene, vinyl toluene and other alkyl and dialkylstyrenes. Mixtures of these hydrocarbons can also be used. In some preferred embodiments of the invention the copolymers contain from about 10 to about 50 by weight of unsaturated hydrocarbon monomer. Examples of the acrylic acid esters which can be used in forming the copolymers of the present invention include the esters of C1 C18 alcohols such as benzyl, cyclohexyl, isobornyl, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, nbutyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, and the several amyl, hexyl, octal including 2 ethylhexyl , decyl, dodecyl and octadecyl isomers and the like. Acrylic acid esters of alcohols having other functionality, in addition to the alcohol functionally used in forming the ester, can be used in forming the copolymers of this invention, such as hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, methoxyethoxyethyl, ethoxyethoxyethyl, methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, and the like acrylates Mixtures of these esters can be used.Preferably, lower alkyl, i. e. C1 C8 esters of acrylic acid and more desirably C1 C4 esters of acrylic acid are employed In some preferred compositions, the copolymers contain from about 1 to 40 , preferably 5 to 20 by weight of an acrylic acid ester, in others the range is 50 to 99 , preferably 80 to 95 . The methacrylic acid esters which can be used as a monomer in forming the copolymers of the present invention, include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, amyl, isoamyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, 2 ethylbutyl, 2 ethylhexyl, octyl, decyl, lauryl, myristyl, cetyl, stearyl, dicyclopentenyl, dicyclopentenyloxyethyl and the like methacrylates. Methacrylic acid esters of alcohols having other functionality, in addition to the alcohol functionality used in forming the ester, can b used in forming the copolymers of this invention, such as hydroxyethyl hydroxypropyl, methoxyethoxyethyl, ethoxyethoxyethyl, methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, and the like methacrylates. Mixtures of these esters can also be used. Preferably lower alkyl, i. e. C1 C , and more desirably C1 C4 , esters of methacrylic acid are employed. In some preferred compositions, the copolymers of the invention contain from about I to 40 , preferably 5 to 20 by weight of a methacrylic acid ester,in others the range is 50 to 99 , preferably 80 to 95 . Compositions consisting essentially of AOnPAte ester mer units are very useful, particularly where high crosslink density is desired. Other ethylenically unsaturated monomers can be used in forming the copolymers of the instant Invent ion, such as the esters of vinyl alcohol including the formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and versatic acid esters the acetic ester being preferred , acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, ethacrylonitrile, phenylacrylonitri le, acrylamide, methacrylamide, ethacrylamide, N methylol acrylamide, N monoalkyl and N,N dialkylacrylamides and methacrylamides including N monomethyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and N,N dimethyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and the like , the corresponding aromatic amides such as Nmonophenyl and N,N diphenyl acrylamides and methacrylamides , vinyl ethers such as butyl vinyl ether , N vinyl lactams such as N vinylpyrrolidone , halogenated vinyl compounds such as vinylidene fluoride, vinyl chloride, and vinylidene chloride , itaconic monoesters and dlesters of the alcohols used in forming the acrylic acid esters, supra, allyl and methallyl esters of saturated monocarboxylic acids such as those used to form esters of vinyl alcohol., supra , vinylthiophene, vinylpyridine, vinylpyrrole, and ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a quaternary amnonium group such as methacryloxyethyl trimethylnonium chloride and acryloxyethy trirethyl ammonium chloride . The copolymers of the present invention are preferably prepared by conventional solution or aqueous emulsion polymerization techniques, however, bulk, suspension or other polymerization methods can be used In coating applications, it is useful to have anAOnPAte content ranging from about 2 to about 95X, by weight, preferably 5 to 85 . Of the many monomers that can be used to copolymerize the AOnPAte, those especially preferred include styrene S , ethyl acrylate EA , n butyl acrylate BA , nbutyl methacrylate BMA , methyl methacrylate , acrylonitrile AN , acrylic acid AA , and methacrylic acid MAA . The solution polymerization may be effected by free radicals obtained from the thermal decomDosition of peresters, such as t butyI peroxypivalate and t butyl peroctoate. However, any of the conventional free radical initiators can be used, including azonitriles, peroxycarbonates and peroxides. The amount of initiator generally used is ca. 1 to 4 by weight, based on the monomers to be polymerized. However, this amount can be over a broader range,. e. g., from about 0.1 to about 10 by weight.Among the useful initiators are the azonitriles such as 2,2 azobis isobutyronitrile , 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile and 1,1 azobis cyclohexanecarbonitrile , the peroxycarbonates such as di n propyl peroxydicarbonate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, dicyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate and di 2 ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate, and the peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, t butyl peracetate and t butyl perbenzoate. As in emulsion polymerization, infra, chain transfer agents can be used to moderate the molecular weight of the copolymer. The same transfer agents and amounts are generally effective. In the preparation of water soluble water reducible copolymers, the monomers can be polymerized in a water miscible solvent such as 2 butoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethyl acetate, isopropanol or isobutanol, and subsequently the acidic groups are neutralized and the system diluted with water. The organic solvent can either be retained apart of the solvent or removed under reduced pressure at a slightly elevated temperature, preferably less than 100 C.The neutralization of the carboxyl functionality, when present in the polymers, can be accomplished with inorganic bases, e. g., ammonia or sodium or potassium hydroxides, or organic bases such az primary secondary or tertiary mines, amino alcohols, and other comnon bases. Usual precautions should be observed to preclude undesired reÅactions, e. g., primary amines are not used it aldehydes or ketones are present. In the preparation of the present copolymers by emulsion polymerization techniques, the emulsifiers or dispersing agents employed and general emulsion polymerization techniques are taught in EmulsionPolymerization by F. A. Bovey et al, Interscience Publishers, 1965, and Emulsion Polymerization by D. C.Blackley, John Wiley Sons, publishers, 1975. The polymerizable. monomer emulsions can be prepared at a temperature in the range of from about Oo C. to about 1000C. and , ii a pressurized reactor is used, even higher temperatures, but intermediate temperatures are generally preferred. Although other free radical initiators are useful, peroxide free radical catalysts, particularly catalytic systems of the redox type, are recommended. Such systems, as is well known, are combinations of oxidizing agents and reducing agents such as a combination of potassium persuffate and sodium metabisulfite.Suitable peroxide agents include the persalts such as the alkali metal and ammonium persulfates and perborates, hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, such as tert butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide, and esters such as tert butyl perbenzoate. Reducing agents include water soluble thiosuifates, hydrosulfites, tertiary amines, such as triethanolamine and the like, thiourea and salts of metals such as the sulfate salts of metals capabIe of existing in more than one valence state such as cobalt, iron, nickel, and copper. A convenient method of preparing the copolymer latex comprises agitating an aqueous suspension or emulsion of the mixture of copolymerizable monomers and redox catalytic combination at room temperature without the application of external heat. The amount of catalyst can vary but the usual range is from 0.01 to 3.0 of the peroxidic agent and the same or lower proportions. of the reducing agent based on the weight of monomer. In this way,It is possible to prepare latices which contain as little as 1 and as much as 60 or even more of the r esinous copolymers on a weight basis. It is more practical and preferred to produce latices which contain from about 30 to about 50 resin solids. If desired, a chain transfer agents used to moderate the molecular weight of the copolymer obtained by the emulsion copolymerization procedure the art known chain transfer agents may be used, including long chain alkyl mercaptans, such as tert dodecyl mercaptan alcohols, such as isopropanol, isobutanol, lauryl alcohol, and tert octyl alcohol halogenated hydrocarbons, such as carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene and trichlorobromomethane. Generally, from about 0 to 3 , by weight, based on the weight of the monomer charge, of the chain transfer agent is used. The monoesters of this invention have utility as monomers from which homopolymers and copolymers are easily prepared by common polymerization techniques including bulk, solution, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. They may also be employed as modifiers or reactive diluents in diverse coating applications, cure of the product monomers in such applications being effected, for example, by conventional thermally activated initiators e.g. peroxides, hydroperoxides, peresters, percarbonstes, azo compounds, etc. or via free radical redox couples, by exposure to ultraviolet light or electron beam radiation, or by chemical reactions well known to those skilled in the art.The polyfunctional esters of this invention can be used as modifiers, crosslinkers, reactive diluents and, where appropriate, even as resin like components of a reactive diluent resin system. In the presence of other polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride or a rubber, the polyesters can be reacted to provide cured, crosslinked, insoluble products.Used in plastisols, to provide fluidity, the polyesters crosslink during usual flexing and curing cycles. They are useful in rotocasting and closed mold casting applications as well as in open systems, where their low volatility is advantageous. In rubber compounding, the AOnPAtes may act as processing aids, to improve tack and decrease mooney viscosity, and product modifiers to improve final properties such as colour, aging resistance, compression set and solvent resistance. Rubbers which may be effectively modified byAOnPAtes include nitrile, styrene butadiene, EPIOM, polybutadiene, polyurethane and acrylic rubbers. A typical polyvinyl chloride thermosol formulation comprises, in parts by weight dispersion grade poly vinylchloride resin 100 polyAOnPAte 10 90 ester plasticizer up to 80 peroxide initiator 0.25 to 2 of AOnPAteSuitable fillers, stabilizers, pigments, fibers etc. may be incorporated The ester monomers of this invention, particularly those having more than one AOnPAte function,can be especially adapted for use in radiation cured systems. In the application of such systems, radiation capable of pausing a chemical change is absorbed to produce curing, usually by means of crosslinking. The radiation includes visibIe, ultraviolet, far ultraviolet, x rays, electron beams and so forth. In one embodiment such a system comprises a multifunctional AOnPAte monomer, a photoinitiator and a polymer having residual unsaturation.The system may also contain other monomers including mono functional AOnPAte esters and could have application wherever clear coatings are used.Other embodiments may comprise the same materials as well as pigments, fillers, other organic polymers including thickeners, surfactants and further specialty materials, such as flattening agents. Coatings cured by electron beams generally are similar but need not comprise a photoinitiator. The ester monomers are generally used to reduce the viscosity of a monomer polymer system to levels required by the specific application means, such as spraying, dipping, brushing, flow coating, etc. Pentaerythritol triAOnPAte and tetra AOnPAte have a high degree of unsaturation and may give high levels of crosslink density in responding readily to ultraviolet or electron beam radiation.Formulations comprising these monomers are especially adapted for use in printing inks and other coating systems. Trimethyloipropane di and tri AOnPAte have a low viscosity thus aiding in producing formulations for applications by procedures requiring good crosslinking and low viscosity. Di AOnPAtes with modest chains between the two groups, such as an ethylene, propylene, butylene or hexamethylene chain or a 2 to 10 member oxyethylene or oxypropylene chain , can provide low viscosity systems for radiation or other curing as well as the production of flexible polymeric finished products.These finished products may include materials such as gravure inks, coatings for flexible substrates, metal decorating coatings, particularly those subjected to forming operations after application of the coating, and coatings for paper and vinyl substrates.Preferred polymers for use with AOnPAte ester monomers of this invention in radiation curing are acrylic functional polymers such as epoxyacrylates e.g., acrylic esters of epichlorohydrin bisphenol A condensates , polyesterurethanes also terminated with two or more acrylate units, polyether acrylates and polyester acrylates. Typically each of these materials has two or more acrylic terminal groups and a backbone of the type described, varying in length and chemical composition to fit the needs of the specific application. Applications include coating of metals, textiles, wood and overcoating other coatings such as in overprint varnishes and, in many instances, printing inks,Examples include coil coatings, metal decorating coatings, coatings for wood panels, plywood, particle board, floor coverings, vinyl polymers, rubber, paper, and road surfaces.Other examples include potting and coating formulations especially those used to make rigid, insoluble polymers. In the UV curable formulations photoinitiators initiate the polymerization by steps believed to include the adsorption of the radiation and the photochemical generation of free radicals. Such photoinitiators usually have adsorption in the 300 to 430 nanometer wave length region.Typical examples of these initiators are aromatic ketones such as benzophenone, acetophenone derivatives and alkylbenzoin ethers optionally in admixture with accelerators such as tertiary amines, and organic halides e.g., tetrachloroethylene. For ultraviolet light curing systems medium pressure mercury arc lamps are often used as the light source. Lamps are readily available having intensities of 100 watts per inch to 300 watts per inch which will effectively cure coatings of up to about 10 mils thickness. Shorter ultraviolet rays will penetrate and cure only a very thin top layer of a coating which behavior may be desired in some instances. An ultraviolet curing station comprises a power source and control equipment, a cooling system, an efficient reflector, such as an eliptical reflector and a radiation shield with a lamp mounted at a distance about 2 to 4 inches from the substrate which is preferably being conveyed by conveyor means. In electron beam curing formulations the photo initiator may be omitted and free radicals are generated as a result of electron impacts. An electron generator forms a highly directed beam which is directed onto the formulation which may be pigmented and typically has a thickness up to. about 2d milts. The electrons are of very high energy such as 3 to 10 million electron volts although other systems employing somewhat longer exposures and or thinner coatings may well operate at lower energies such as down to 100,000 electron volts. The radiation is applied in dosages expressed in rads, the unit of radiation that results in the adsorption of 100 ergs of energy per gram of irradiated material. The common unit is the megarad Mrad . Commonly about 1 10 to 10 Mrads is employed with about 0.5 to 5 Mrads being preferred. Irradiation can be carried out in air at atmospheric pressure, or under partial or high vacuum conditions, or in an inert gas atmosphere. In some instances air seems to have an inhibitory effect on the crosslinking efficiency. A flame retardant curable composition may be made by employing the bis AOnPAte of bis 2hydroxyethyl tetrachloroterephthalate following the procedures taught in U.S. Patent 4,208,502. The esterification of the hydroxyethyl compound withAOnPA can proceed more readily than with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. A further embodiment of this invention is in the preparation of rubber comprising radiation curable paint as taught in U.S. Patent 3,719,521, wherein the acrylate and methacrylate cross linking agents are replaced by the multi functional AOnPAte esters of the instant invention to effect a surprising improvement. Also the hydroxyalkyl AOnPAtes are advantageously substituted for the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate of the patent. A further embodiment of this invention is the preparation of foams and rigid thermoset articles.These preparations are exemplified by those described in U.S. Patent 4,180,632, wherein the acrylate monomers of the patent are replaced by the multi functionalAOnPAtes of the instant invention.

Example 15 Volatility of Acrylates and AOnPAtes Volatility data on AOnPAte esters and acrylate esters are obtained by boiling point measurements and by measurements of retention time in a gas chromatograph employing columns which reflect the volatility little influenced by the chemical nature of the material. A Ovarian 3700 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and stainless steel columns of a methyl silicone gum OV 1 or a phenyl 50 methyl silicone gum OV 17 was employed. The acrylates used were the commercially available materials and the AOnPAtes were those described in previous examples except for the one based on ethanol as the alcohol which was made buy the method of Example 1.The retention time is that of the pure compound, acrylate or w Q acryloxy propionate, resulting after separation from impurities in the gas chromatograph. The data obtained are presented in Table 10. It is readily seen that the t acryloxy propionates are far less volatile than the corresponding acrylates the former have much higher boiling points and greater retention times in the gas chromatograph equipped with the same column and having the same run conditions.

Example 16 Monomer Cure Response to Ultraviolet Radiation The monomers of Examples 6 and 9, respectively, formulated with 2 wt. diethoxyacetophenone, were coated on aluminum panels to a nominal thickness of 0.05 mm. 2 mil. , and irradiated on a U. V. range PPG Co. containing two standard medium pressure mercury lamps 80 watts cm. with parabolic reflectors. Cure response in air and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively, were rated by pencil hardness and a physical examination of the film surface. Results are presented in Tables 4 and 5 along with data for 1,6hexanediol diacrylate, l,10 decanedidl diacrylate, and trimethylolpropane triacrylate TMPTA controls.

S. 4,251,597 Except for some differences in hardness reverse impact, and chemical resistance, the properties of the two coatings are fairly similar. Thus, the monomer of this invention performs in a manner comparable to that of the corresponding triacrylate.The principal advantage of the monomer of this invention, however, iies in its reduced .toxicity. It exhibits a skin sensitivity or Draize rating of less than 1 slight irritant whereas trimethylolpropane triacrylate, used as a control in the same sensitivity test, exhibits a Draize rating greater than 4 moderate irritant . Example 18 Cure of AOnPAtes Table 7 compares various neat multifunctional acrylate andAOnPAte monomers for their cure response by electron beam EB or ultraviolet W irradiation. Cure was quantitatively measured using infrared analysis to follow the disappearance of the reactive double bond at ca. 810 wave numbers and also qualitatively by rubbing the surface with methanol saturated cheese cloth under moderate finger pressure. The table reports the percent conversion of double bonds after exposure to l megarad Mrad EB irradiation Energy Science, Inc. model CB 200 30 20,l75 Kev or after 1 pass at 50 m min under a medium pressure W lamp operating at 40 watt cm. Radiation Polymer Corp. Model. QC 1202 .It also lists the EB dose needed, or the number of UV passes needed at 130 m min. 80 W cm. , for a thin coating to survive 50 back and forth methanol rubs with no visible damage. Diethoxy acetophenone DEAP, Upjohn Co. was used as photoinitiator for W cure at the levels noted 0.5, 2, or 5 and the coating was exposed in air, nitrogen, or between air impervious substrates closed . The data show clearly and surprisingly that l all. the difunctional AOnPAte monomers cure much faster than the hexanediol diacrylate control, 2 similarly, the AOnPA triester of trimethylol propane and the AOnPA tetraester of pentaerythritrol cure faster than the correspondi ng acrylic acid multiesters by EB conversion, 3 the tripropyleneglycol diacrylate. and the tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate cure more slowly than the AOnPA diester monomers except as determined by IR analysis of EB cure. The fast cure response is par1 icularly surprising since the concention of acrylate double bonds is lower inthe higher molecular weight AOnPA multiesters.

Example 19 AOnPAte containina C02tNnas Coating formulations Table 8 containing equal weights of monomer and of acrylate terminated oligomers were prepared.Free filmswere.made for stress strain testing by using 5 mil.opening Cardnere knife drawdowns on decal paper Dennison Co., 2242 , setting the coating by exposure to 0.25 to 0.6 Mrad EB irradiation, cutting these gelled coatings into the appropriate test strips, removing them from the decal paper and finally fully curing each by exposing top and bottom surfaces to 5 Mrad ES irradiation.Coatings for impact resistance and hardness measurements Table 9 were 8 mil. drawdowns on steel panels cured by one EB pass at a 10 Mrad dose. The tables report the stress strain data obtained according to ASTM American Society For Testing Material D882 79, the falling weight impact resistance by ASTM D2794 69, and theTukon hardness by ASTM D1474. The data Tables 8, 9 show clearly that for all comparable urethane diacrylate formulations, the AOnPA ester films except theneopentyl glycoI diester have a lower modulus, greater elongation and much greater.impact resistance than the acrylate. ester films. That these properties are not greatly offset by lower hardness or tensile strength is shown. by the work to break data. It is seen that,in general,the AOnPAte formulaticns produce films having equal or higher values of tensile strength, elongation and work to break than do the commercial acrylate esters. The oligomer diacrylates admixed with the monomers of this invention, as described in this Example, are suitable as coatings. The epoxy types are particularly good as coatings for hardboard, as wood lacquers and as paper or print materials. The urethane types are especially useful as vinyl flooring coatings. The ethylene glycol di AOnPAte leads to greater impact resistance than either hexanediol diacrylate or decanediol diacrylate. The improved elongation and impact hardness balance is surprising because decanediol diacrylate has the same number of connecting carbon and oxygen atoms between functional double bonds as does the di AOnPA ester. The difference in the so called toughness index the product of the hardness XXN and reverse impact resistance in. lbs. , is particularly large.
