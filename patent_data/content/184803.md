# Sequential logic integrated circuit for PCM compression.

## Abstract
The cricuit comprises two registers SR12, SR8 which temporarily memorize uncompressed and compressed PCM words, respectively. The uncompressed word is sequentialiy read and a counter CNT counts the number of zeros present in the most significant positions of the absolute value of said word. The compressed word is composed, in the corresponding register, of the sign bit of the uncompressed word, followed by the counting bits of the counter and by the bits of the positions of the uncompressed word following those of the counted zeroes.
