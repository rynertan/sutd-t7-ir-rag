# Plural computer control for shared laser machining.

## Abstract
A laser machining apparatus is disclosed for machining each of at least first and second work pieces and, in particular, for conducting a sequence of machining steps on each such work piece. The laser machining apparatus includes a single, time shared laser for emitting a laser beam, and beam directing means having a movable laser reflective portion, whereby the single laser beam may be directed along a first laser path to the first work piece and along a second laser path to the second work piece. It is understood that the beam directing means is dedicated to the processing of just one work piece at a time.
