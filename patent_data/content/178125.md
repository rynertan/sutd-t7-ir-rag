# Labeled antibody fragments.

## Abstract
Bifunctional coupling agents for joining radionuclide met al ions to biologically useful molecules, including antibody Fab fragments are disclosed. The coupling agents contain a maleimide moiety and a paramagnetic or radionuclide chelating moiety. The maleimide can be used to selectively bind to free sulfhydryl groups, or amine groups.
