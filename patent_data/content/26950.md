## Description
An electronic rear light for a bicycle or a mopedThe invention relates to a rear light for a bicycle or a moped inwhich a circuit with Light Emitting Diodes, LED s has been applied. In a suitable model of rear light has been placed a circuit of Led s.The tradional rearlight consist of a body, inwich a glow lamp with a screw thread or a bayonet catch has been placed,The disadvantage of this type of rear light is the short duration of the glow lamp. mostly a glow lamp will break by trembling of the bicycle on the road, before it gets worn out.An incidental disadvantange is that the glow lamp sometimes has been taken out by others. This is possible because the lamp is interchangeable quickly. An other disadvantange of glow lamps is the low output, which is about 35 or less.A soloution for the problem with glow lamp rear lights seemed theGerman invention inwhich a number of Led s have been used in a rear light. This is written in the German tOffen legungsschrift 26.33.270.In here two methods are descriped, the first method contains twoLed s,which are connected inverse parallel in series with the frontlight, which is a glow lamp. X second method is to connect a Led inverse parallel to a silicon diode, the circuit is connected in series again with the front light. Yhe disadvantage of this series circuits is the duration of the complete lighting parts of the bicycle depends on the duration of the glow lamp. Besides the characteristic of the glow lamp is also determining for the properties of the Led s. A circuit in series of the front and rear lighting of a bicycle or a moped, is not usual.The invention as claimed is intended to provide a rear light which does not have the disadvantages of the glow lamp lighting and which does not have the disadvntaes of the german invention with Led s as mention above. This can be obtained by using a parallelelcircuit, in a given case, an inverseparallel circuit of a number of Led s, the Led s will be pre connected by a capacitor and the rear light work s independent of the front light. Abstract An electronic rear light for a bicycle or a moped. For the working of the circuit,we have to look at the circuit which is drawed in fig 1.In the vectordiagram of fig.2. and the graphical tensionfield of the dynamo in fig.3, we see that the current and the tension for alternating current is 900 out of face, Icl and Ucl, the capacitor does not take much power, except some dielectrical losses. The tension of both Led s Udi and Ud2 are in phase with Icl while the vectorial sum of both currents of 1d1 and 1d2 are similar to the current which goes through the capacitor C1. Further the current is shown by the glow lamp L1 which is in phase with Ug of the dynamo. D1 conducts fig.3 during the positive part of the alternating tension.After 5 R.C. C1 will be loaded completely, during that time current goes through the Led, the Led will burn, while during the negative period in the other Led current will go through and this will burn. One Led loads the capacitor, while the otherLed unloads the capacitor. The circuit of the Led s can be build in different ways. Not only a capcitor can be used as a pre connected component, but also a few other possibiloties are shown. The requirements for bicycle rearlight for the Netherlands are published in the Official Government Gazette of llonday august 23rd 1971 nor.161. An adaptation to these requirements of the present day of technic is necessary, because no Led s have been used before. The invention will be illustrated by some drawings inwhich some models are shown.
