# Process for the polymerization of cyclic polyhalophosphazenes using a catalyst composition of boron trihalide and oxygenated phosphorus compounds.

## Abstract
Linear polydihalophosphazene polymers which are sub stantially free of gel are prepared by thermally polymerizing a cyclic polyhalophosphazene represented by the formula NPX₂ ₃, wherein X is fluorine, chlorine or bromine in the presence of a catalyst which comprises the reaction product of a boron trihalide compound with an oxygenated phos phorus compound. In addition to producing substantially gel free polymers, the catalyst composition of the process of the invention per mits improved control of molecular weight, lower polymeriza tion temperature, high rates of conversion of NPCl₂ ₃ to NPCl₂
