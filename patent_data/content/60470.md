# Method and apparatus for non destructive inspection of tyres.

## Abstract
A pulsed through transmission ultrasonic non destructive inspection of the internal structure in a tire wall 112 is effected. The ultrasonic inspection is preferably carried out through the walls 112 of a rotating inflated tire with the ultrasonic tranducers 500, 502, 210 being automatically moved toward the inner and outer tire wall surfaces to optimum relative distances of separation during an inspection cycle. The transducers 500, 502 disposed inside the inflated tire are preferably mounted 1504 for automatic retraction into a protected space 1506 during tire mounting and demounting operations. Such ultrasonic inspection techniques may be combined with conventional tire buffing methods and apparatus 204 as practiced in tire retreading operations.
