# Fuel spacer.

## Abstract
A plurality of independent cells 9 having a regular oc tagonal cross section are arranged in the form of a lattice. Cross sectionally square independent cells 9 are substi tuted for two octagonal cells in the central portion of the lat tice arrangement. These two square independent cells 9 are so formed that each side of the cells 9 has the largest possible length when the cells are placed among the adja cent cells having a regular octagonal cross section. Spacer support rods 5 serving also as water rods are inserted into the square cells 9 in such a fuel spacer 4 , which consists of a combination of cells having a regular octagonal cross section and cells having a square cross section as men tioned above, to form a fuel assembly.
