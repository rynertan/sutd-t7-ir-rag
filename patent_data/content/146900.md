## Description
Process for producing azetidinones This invention relates to an industrially advantageous process for producing azetidinones of the formula EMI1.1 whereinEMI1.2 is a protective group for the amino group R is a protective group for the nitrogen atom of the imino compound R3 is an organic residue bonding through a carbon atom thereof, which are of great value as an intermediate for the synthesis of naturally occurring compounds and pharmaceuticals, particularly B lactam antibiotics. There have heretofore been known a variety of processes for producing azetidinones, and among such processes is known a cycloaddition reaction as a procedure of producing optically active azetidinone compounds. As the process for producing azetidinones havingEMI1.3 whereinEMI1.4 is as defined hereinbefore at the 3 position by means of the cycloaddition reaction, there are known a process Journal of ChemicalSociety, 1880 1975 involving the reaction of an acid chloride with an imine compound, a method Synthesis, 210 1979 consisting of the reaction of an active ester formed from 2 chloro N methylpyridinium iodide and an acid with aSchiff base, and a process Synthesis, 689 1976 comprising the reaction of an active ester formed from a phosphonium salt and an acid with a Schiff base.These processes, however, suffer from the disadvantages of lowered yield, prolonged reaction time, complicated post treatment and costly raw materials required, etc. Moreover, it is considered difficult to produce azetidinones, particularly azetidinones havingEMI2.1 at the 3 position, in one step in satisfactory yields by means of these processes.Therefore, azetidinones havingEMI2.2 at the 3 position are synthesized The Japanese Unexamined Patent PublicationNo. 46060 1983 by reacting a reactive derivative of a compound of the formula R CH2COOH wherein R is azide, phthalimido or a group represented by R OCO CH C CH3 NH wherein R is lower alkyl , with a Schiff base, then converting the 3 substituent R of the resulting azetidinones to the amino group and introducingEMI2.3 into the 3 amino group, but this synthetic process, because of an increased number of steps involved, is not industrially advantageous.Since the protective groupEMI2.4 for the amino group can allow selection of the type of R through the employed method of deprotecting, on the other hand, azetidinones havingEMI2.5 at the 3 position are considered of value as a useful intermediate, and an industrially favored production process for such compounds is needed. The present inventors, under these circumstances as described above, conducted extensive investigation into a method of synthesizing azetidinones havingEMI2.6 at the 3 position, and as a result, found that a compound of the formula EMI3.1 whereinEMI3.2 is as defined hereinbefore EMI3.3 is an esterified carboxyl group can be reacted with a compound of the formula R2.N H.R3 III wherein the symbols are as defined hereinbefore or a salt thereof to produce the azetidinones I in one step and at reduced costs and furthermore that a reaction mixture formed by the reaction of an amino protected glycine,EMI3.4 whereinEMI3.5 is as defined hereinbefore, or a salt thereof with an alkyl halogenocarbonate in the presence of a base can be reacted with the compound III or a salt thereof to produce the azetidinone I in one step and economically, whereby in addition to this, the reaction provides the advantages as an industrial production process, such as shortened reaction time, simplified post treatment and increased yields.

Chem. Soc. , 1880 1975 or methods similar thereto. Synthesis of the compound II is mentioned in more detail hereinafter. The compound III may be synthesized, for example, by the method described in the JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication No. 46066 1983 or methods similar thereto.

The compound III may be used either in the free state or in the form of a conventional salt. As salts of the compound III , there may be used, for example, salts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, or salts with organic acids such as acetic acid, para toluenesulfonic acid and oxalic acid. Salts with mineral acids are more preferable in the present invention. This reaction is carried out by allowing 1 mole of the compound III or a salt thereof to react with 1 to 6 equivalent moles, preferably 1 to 3 equivalent moles, of the compound II . This reaction may be conducted in a solvent. As such a solvent, there may be used, for example, aprotic solvents. Specific examples of the solvent may be ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloroethane, methylene chloride and chloroform, nitriles , such as acetonitrile, and amides, such as N,N dimethylformamide andN,N dimethylacetamide. As the preferred solvent, there may be used, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride.

As the reaction temperature, there may employed temperatures of 70 to 1000C, preferably 20 to 400C. The reaction proceeds and completes within a very short period of time.Therefore, the reaction time of up to 2 hours is sufficient, and the preferred reaction time may be 5 to 40 minutes. After the completion of the reaction, it is also possible to determine the amount of the objective compound I produced, for example, by employing high speed liquid chromatography, etc. The objective compound I thus obtained can be isolated and purified by the known isolation methods, such as extraction, washing, chromatography, crystallization and recrystallization, but can also be used, without being isolated, as a starting material in the subsequent reaction. In the process of the present invention which involves the reaction of the above described compounds II and III or a salt thereof to produce the objective compound I , it is advantageous to use, as the compound II , a reaction mixture obtained by the reaction of an amino protected glycine,EMI8.1 or a salt thereof with an alkyl halogenocarbonate in the presence of a base. As the salt of the amino protected glycine, there may be used, for example, salts with alkali metals such as sodium and potassium, or salts with tertiary amines such as tri Cl 4 alkyl amine being exemplified by trimethylamine, triethylamine and tributylamine. Preferred examples of the salt of the amino protected glycine may be, for example, salts with triethylamine and tributylamine. As the halogen in the alkyl halogenocarbonate, there may be used, for example, bromine and chlorine. As the alkyl in the alkyl halogenocarbonate, there may be used, for example C 1 6 alkyl, which includes specifically such alkyls as exemplified in the above for R. Preferred examples of the alkyl halogenocarbonate may be, for example, ethyl chlorocarbonate, isopropyl chlorocarbonate and isobutyl chlorocarbonate. In the case of such a reaction mixture being used, the amount of the amino protected glycine or a salt thereof to be used may be 1 to 6 equivalent moles per mole of the compound III , preferably 2 to 4 equivalent moles. The amount of the alkyl halogenocarbonate to be used may be 1 to 10 equivalent moles per mole of the amino protected glycine or a salt thereof, preferably 2 to 6 equivalent moles. The reaction of an amino protected glycine or a salt thereof with an alkyl halogenocarbonate may be carried out in a solvent. As the solvent, there may be used, for example, the solvents as exemplified for the reaction between the compounds II and III or a salt thereof.The amount of the solvent to be used is 1 to 30 m per g of the amino protected glycine or a salt thereof, preferably to 5 to 15 mQ. It is advantageous to carry out this reaction in the presence of a base. Such a base may be, for example, tertiary amines such as tri C1 4 alkyl amines being exemplified by triethylamine and tributylamine. The amount of the base to be used may be 1 to 7 equivalent moles per mole of the amino protected glycine or a salt thereof, preferably 2 to 6 equivalent moles. An amino protected glycine or a salt thereof may be reacted with an alkyl halogenocarbonate in the presence of such a base at a temperature of, for example, 80 to 200C, preferably 400C to 100C. The reaction time may be an extremely short length of time.Concretely, it suffices to allow the reaction to proceed only for a length of time of less than 2 hours, preferably 3 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture thus obtained is used as such in the subsequent reaction with the compound III or a salt thereof. The compound III or a salt thereof may be added to the reaction mixture obtained after the above reaction, but may also be added in advance of, or in the course of, the above reaction. For example, such a compound, after being mixed with at least one out of the amino protected glycine, or a salt thereof, alkyl halogenocarbonate, base and solvent, may be added to the abovementioned reaction system. The azetidinone I thus obtained can exist in four isomers having cis and trans configurations relative to the 3 and 4 substituents. The present invention is especially suitable and advantageous for producing selectively the 3S, 4S azetidinones I , particularly the compounds of the formula EMI10.1 wherein R2 is as defined hereinbefore.

The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the methylene chloride is distilled off under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 60 ml of methylene chloride and 600 ml of n hexane is added to the solution to allow crystals to separate out. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with 90 mQ of a mixed solvent of methylene chloride n hexane 1 4 to give 32.9 g yield of 77.9 of crystals of 3S,S 3 benzyloxycarboxamido l 3,4 diemthoxybenzyl 4 R 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxolan 4 yl 2 azetidinone.
