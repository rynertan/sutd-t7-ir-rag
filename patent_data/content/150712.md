# METHOD FOR THE OBTENTION OF A GLYCOSPHINGOLIPID COMPLEX

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the obtention of a glycosphingolipids complex characterized by the prepara tion in the first step of an acetone dried powder of animal brains by means of their anhydrification through successive acetone treatments then, from the prepared powder, gan gliosides are axtracted with a solvent solution water me thanol chloroform in a way that they remain dissolved in the aqueous phase impurified with phospholipids then a purification is performed by Silica gel columm chromato graphy changing the polarity of eluent from an apolar sol vent mixture that eluates phospholipids, remaining the gan gliosides in the columm, to a more polar one that eluates gangliosides. Once the gangliosides are obtained, these are fractionated through ionic exchange columm chromato graphy. Finally, ganglioside mixture is reformulated in or der to obtain the desired glycosphingolipid complex.
