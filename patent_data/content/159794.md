## Description
INTRODUCTION The present invention relates to novel surfactants derived from fortified rosins, which surfactants are of particular use in the preparation of rosin emulsions, suitable for sizing paper. Rosin contains a mixture of aromatic carboxylic acids whose major constituent is the tricyclic, doubly unsaturated, monocarboxylic acid, abietic acid. The levopimaric acid isomer of abietic acid undergoes Diels Alder reactions with dienophiles. In particular rosin may be reacted with dienophilic carboxylic acids such as maleic anhydride or fumaric acid to form a tetracyclic poly carboxylic acid, This process is called fortification . Fortified rosins are widely used in size for the paper industry. Conventionally, fortified rosin is saponified with alkali and emulsified in water. Casein is added to stabilise the emulsion.Casein stabilised emulsions, however, are susceptible to microbiolical spoilage. To avoid this problem a number of attempts have been made to develop alternative stabilisers. For example various surfactants, including alkyl phenyl ether sulphates and sulphosuccinate half esters have been proposed as stabilisers. The casein free rosin emulsions proposed hitherto have all exhibited various disadvantages which have rendered them generally uncompetitive with conventional casein stabilised emulsions. These disadvantages include poor stability, particularly on shearing, and a tendency to foam. Because of these disadvantages, there has been a trend away from the casein free emulsion and back to casein stabilised size. We have now discovered that a substantially improved anionic stabiliser for rosin emulsions may be obtained by reacting a derivative of fortified rosin acid having a plurality of polyalkyleneoxy chains per molecule, so as to provide a sulphosuccinate half ester. THE PRIOR ART U.S.P. 4,203, 776 describes the use of alkyl phenyl ether sulphosuccinates as stabilisers for fortified rosin emulsions. U.S. P, 4,267,099 describes the use of alkyl phenyl ether sulphates as rosin emulsion stabilisers. U.S.P 4,260,550 describes non Ionic surfactants prepared by reacting maleinated abietic acid with a non ionic polyoxyalkylene surfactant. U.S.P. 4,238,380 describes the use of sulphosuccinate half esters of ethexylated rosin acids having l to s alkyleneoxy groups as foal stabilisers for latex emulsions. This disclosure counterindicates the use of such products as size stabilisers. where foam stabilisation is a serious disadvantage. Japanese Patent No. 8270158 describes the use of the sulphosuccinate half esters of ethoxylated rosin acid to emulsify rosin in water. The composition described in the aforesaid Japanese patent is based on the monocarboxylic rosin acid. It thus differs fundamentally from our novel surfactants in posessing only one hydrophilic group. Such products are insufficiently soluble in water to provide commercially acceptable rosin emulsions. THE INVENTION The present invention provides a novel surfactant comprising the alkali metal, ammonium or alkaline earth natal sulphosuccinate half ester, of an alkolated, fortified rosin acid, having an average of at least 1.5 polyalkyleneoxy groups per molecule of said surfactant. According to a more specific embodiment our invention provides a maleinated and or fumarated rosin, ethoxylated to provide an average of from 0.5 to 1 equivalents of polyethyleneoxy chains per esterifiable carboxy group, said polyethyleneoxy chains having an average of from 4.5 to 30 ethyleneoxy units each, and being esterifled with sodium sulphosuccinyl groups. In particular our invention provides a compound or mixture of compounds. of the formula H 3 m R. E CH2CH2O n OC.C2H3S03Na. COONa m wherein R is a fortified rosin acid tricarboxylate group, m has. an average value of from 1.5 to 3, and n has an average value from 4.5 to 25 and mixtures of rosin acids and or fortified rosin acids and or water, containing such a compound or mixture of compounds. Typically, products according to our invention comprise a mixture of salts of unesterifled and partially esterified mono and polycarboxylic rosin acids. According to a further embodiment our invention provides a method for the preparation of a surfactant, which method comprises i reacting fortified levopimaric acid or a fortified rosin at elevated temperature with from 1.5 to 3 moles of polyethylene glycol per mole of polycarboxylic acid, said polyethylene glycol having an average of from 4.5 to 50 ethyleneoxy groups per molecule thereof, ii reacting the ethoxylated acid with maleic anhydride and iii reacting the product of ii with alkali metal sulphite. According to a further embodiment our invention provides an oil in water emulsion of rosin, preferably fortified rosin, optionally at least partially saponified, together with a stabilising proportion of a surfactant of the invention. THE ROSIN ACID The rosin acid feedstock for use in our invention is a fortified rosin acid. Typically, a gum rosin or, preferably, on economic grounds, a tall oil rosin, is fortified by reaction with anOk ss dicarboxylic acid or anhydride such as maleic anhydride or fummaric acid or with any esterifiable or transesterifiable derivatl of maleic or fuaric acid, such as an acid chloride or methyl ester, or less preferably with any other dienophilic di or poly carboxylic acid. Alternatively a fortified abietic acid fraction of rosin nay be used as the acid feedstock. The degree of fortification is typically frol 40 to 100 molar based on the total fortifiable acid content of the rosin. This usually represents from 20 to 60 molar of the total rosin e.g. at least 30 . This nay be achieved by reacting the rosin with from 5 to 18 , based on the weight of rosin, of maleic anhydride andlor fularic acid, preferably 6 to 18 , e.g. 10 to 16X by weight. Typically the reaction is carried out at temperatures substantially greater than the melting point e.g. typically above 110 C but insufficient to decolpose the rosin e.g. temperatures of 150 C to 200 C are prefered. The reaction is optionally but preferably performed in the presence of a crystallisation Inhibitor, e.g. para formaldetyde or formalin. Lower aryl sulphonic acids such as para toluene sulphonic acid in catalytifc quantities, may also be present. üsually the reaction takes 5 to 5 hours to complete in the presence of a catalyst and 5.5 to 8 hours in the absence of catalyst THE ALKOXYLATION The fortified rosin is preferably alkoxylated by esterifying the acid with a polyalkylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol is strongly preferred. Polylsopropoxy groups or mixed propoxy ethoxy groups are within the broad scope of the invention but are substantially less satisfactory than polyethyleneoxy groups. Esterification may be carried out in any conventional way for esterifying involatile carboxylic acids and alcohols. Typically the fortified rosin is melted and the polyalkylene glycol is added, optionally in the presence of an esterificatlon catalyst such as zinc oxide. Preferably the mixture is heated to a temperature of 250 3009C under an Inert atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen, for from 3 to 5 hours Typically the polyalkylene glycol is added in a proportion sufficient to provide an average of from 1.5 to 3 polyalkyleneoxy groups per molecule of alkoxylated fortified acid in the product, preferably 2 to 3 groups per molecule. We believe that the polyalkylene glycol reacts preferentially with the two carboxy groups of the fortified acid, which derive from the maleic or fumaric acid. The polyalkylene glycol preferably has an average of more than 4.5 but less than 50 alkyleneoxy units per molecule, e.g. 13.6 to 46 units per molecule, especially 10 to 15. Generally speaking, rosin esters with an average of less than 13 ethyleneoxy groups, total, per molecule of fortified rosin ester, form anionic surfactant products which are insufficiently soluble in water to be useful as emulsion stabilisers, while products with more than 70 total ethylene oxy units per ester molecule tend to be of too high a molecular weight for effective stabilisation of rosin emulsions. Preferably surfactants according to our invention have from 13 to 60 ethylene oxide units per ester molecule. do not exclude the possibility of some polyethylene glycol di levopliarate or higher copolymer forming, but analysis has failed to provide evidence of such products, and suggests that the porportion, if any, Is snail. Alkoxylation of the fortified rosin feedstock nay alternatively be effected by reacting the rosin acids. with alkylene oxide at elevated temperature under pressure or in the presence of an alkali catalyst. PREPARATION OF THE ANIONIC SURFACTANT The nonionic intermediate formed by alkoxylation of the rosin acid feedstock may be converted into an anionic surfactant of the invention by at of the leans conventional in the surfactant art for preparing anionic surfactants from nonionic surfactant alcohol precursor. For example the intermediate nay react with maleic anhdride to form a maleate half ester, which nay be sulphonated by reaction with sodium sulphate. Preferably the reaction fixture is mafintained at a temperature of between 70 C and 100 C for from 40 to 100 Minutes prior to addition of the sulphite.The latter may then Mlxed with maleate half ester and sufficient hot water e.g. 7OoC to 100 C0 added to fon a clear solution. Typically such a solution nay contain up to SOX by weight of solids. In preparing the anionic surfactant fro the non ionic precursor a stoichiometric excess of either reagent of up to, for example 10 by weight nay be employed. Preferably however the portions are substantially stoichiometric. The anionic surfactant of our invention is preferably the sodium salt. Other water soluble salts such as potassium, lithium, ammonium or calcium may be used, but are substantially inferior to sodium salts in their emulsion stabilising action. Mixed salts may be used. It is possible, in theory, to prepare surfactants of our invention by a process which comprises the steps of reacting fortified rosin with a polyethylene glycol mono maleate half ester or mono sulphosuccinate half ester . In practice, however, this approach tends to provide unsatisfactory products, probably due to formation of copolymers, and is therefore not preferred. PREPARATION OF ROSIN EMULSIONS Rosin emulsions may be prepared using our novel surfactant by the inversion process. The rosin, preferably a fortified rosin optionally treated with para formaldehydein in the presence of para toluene sulphonic acid toInhibit crystallisation, and optionally one which has been at least partially saponified with concentrated sodium or potassium hydroxide or with a volatile base such as ammonia or a lower amino such as methyl amine or triethanolamine, may be melted and a stabilising proportion of the surfactant e.g. from 5 to 15 based on the total weight of rosin and surfactant may then be added as a concentrated e.g. 50 by weight solids aqueous solution. Sufficient water is stirred in to form a creamy water in oil emulsion e.g. 20 to 40 based on the weight of rosin . On dilution with water the emulsion inverts to provide a stable oil in water emulsion, typically having a solids content of from 20 by weight up to the maximum achievable oil in water concentration, often about 50 by weight solids and preferably from 30 to 40 by weight solids. The rosin content of the emulsion or dispersion usually contains at least 90 of unsaponified rosin acids. The emulsions may be used for sizing paper, including alumed paper. The emulsions may contain biocides, such as bactericides, slimicides and or fungicides, or diluents such as wax. MISCELLANEOUS USES Our novel surfactants are also useful generally as dispersants, For example they nay be used to disperse pigments and fillers for use in paints. They nay be used to form talc dispersions for paper coating. They nay be used as dispersants In the preparation of coal dust slurries, aqueous tackiflers, disproportionated rosins, rosin diluents such as paraffin wax, Metal finishing systems such as degreasing solutions, and in oil field secondary recovery and the dispersion of oil spills.
