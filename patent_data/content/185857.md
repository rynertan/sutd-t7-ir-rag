# Shield tunneling machine.

## Abstract
A shield tunneling machine comprises a tubular shield body 12 , a partition wall 14 provided in the shield body, a rotary shaft 20 supported rotatably by the partition wall and extending longitudinally of the shield body, a cutter head 22 disposed on the front end of the rotary shaft and a mechanism 50 for rotating the cutter head through the rotary shaft. The cutter head 22 comprises a first cutter 24 provided with a plurality of cutter bits and a second cutter 26 provided with a plurality of roller bits 44 . The machine also comprises a mechanism 62 , for moving straight forward and backward one of the first and second cutters relative to the other. The machine locates the first cutter more forward than the second cutter for excavating the face of stratum having a soft layer like clay layer with the first cutter and the second cutter more forward than the first cutter for excavating the face of the stratum having a hard layer like bedrock layer with the second cutter.
