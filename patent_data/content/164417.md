# THERMAL RECORDING MATERIAL.

## Abstract
A thermal recording material containing, in its heat sen sitive, colour forming layer containing a leuco dye and an organic acidic substance capable of reacting with the leuco dye to form color, a hydrocarbon compound having a melting point of 50 to 200 C selected from the group consisting of benzylbiphenyls, alkylbenzylbiphenyls, hydrogenated ben zylbiphenyls, hydrogenated alkylbenzylbiphenyls, hydrogen ated terphenyls, and hydrogenated alkylterphenyls. This material has a high heat response and is suited for high speed recording.
