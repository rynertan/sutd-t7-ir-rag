# Method and apparatus for detecting leakage in tanks.

## Abstract
A partial vacuum is created in a perforated tank 10 by means of a pump 37 driven by an electric motor 38 so as to produce a pressure difference across the tank wall and thus to cause air to pass through the perforation. A hydrophone included in a probe 22 senses the acoustic waves produced by the formation of air bubbles in the fuel 14 , which are processed to provide an electrical signal which is supplied to a control and display unit 27 and from there to an oscilloscope 29 and headphones 31 where they can be recognised by the operator and thus indicate the presence of the perforation. The method and apparatus can also be used with above ground fuel storage tanks and other types of above and below ground storage tanks.
