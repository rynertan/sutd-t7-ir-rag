# Welding torch.

## Abstract
The disclosure is directed to an improved welding torch compact in size and efficient in operation, which is free from obstruction to feeding of an electrode wire by sputter, with a passage for maintaining a stable shielding gas flow being provided, and is capable of resuming welding by cutting off an end portion of the electrode wire even when such end portion is fused, onto an item to be welded.
