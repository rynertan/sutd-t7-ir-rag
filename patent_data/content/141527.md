# CYLINDER HEAD FOR SPARK IGNITION INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
A cylinder head 1 has four valves 2, 4 per cylinder and the desirable arrangement whereby the sparking plug 7 electrodes are in the centre of the four valves. The sparking plug 7 is housed in a tube 29 to protect it from the oil in the valve gear region of the head. By appropriate choice of dimensions, it has been found possible to operate the valves 2, 4 via rockers 9, 11 by means of a camshaft 18 located in the vee space between the valves, while still allowing room to accommodate the sparking plug 7. A desirable compactness is thereby achieved.
