# A camera support assembly.

## Abstract
A camera support assembly 10 comprises a base 16 providing an elongate slide bed 18 , a first slide carriage 20 for attachment to a camera 12 and a second slide carriage 22 for attachment to a camera lens 14 . The slide carriages 20, 22 are slidable longitudinally along the slide bed 18 and the support assembly 10 provides ready adjustement of the centre of gravity of a supported camera 12 and lens 14 , with respect to the base 16 , while mitigating bending loads between the camera 12 and lens 14 . Preferably, the slide bed 18 comprises slide walls 32 which converge and the slide carriages 20, 22 have complementary configurations such that the carriages 20, 22 can only be displaced longitudi nally along the base 18 .
