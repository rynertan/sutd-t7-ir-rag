# Resonant current driven power source.

## Abstract
Preferably, the power source is a DC converter regula tor including an inductor L1 and a capacitor C1 electri cally coupled to one another. An input inverter 12 converts an input DC voltage Es into an AC voltage having substan tially no DC component and applies the AC voltage across the inductor L1 and capacitor C1 in a manner which causes the inductor and capacitor to resonate with one another whereby an AC voltage appears across the capaci tor. An output circuit 16 converts the AC voltage appearing across the capacitor C1 into a DC output voltage Ep . A control circuit 18 is provided for controlling the operation of the inverter circuit in a manner which controls the magni tude of the output voltage.
