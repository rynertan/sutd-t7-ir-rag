# Control system for an AC DC convertor.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a multi loop control system for convertors of the kind used in h.v.d.c. transmission and industrial applications. The invention consists in a control circuit which effects transfer between two or more control loops, e.g. a constant current loop and a constant Î± loop, in a smooth and precise manner, without extra smoothing lags, even in the presence of ripple in the controlled quantities.
