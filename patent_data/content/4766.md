## Description
4 HALO PREGN 4 ENES, THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL USE This invention relates to corticosteroids. More specifically it relates to pregn 4 enes which are substituted at the 4 position with fluoro or chloro and which are topically active anti inflammatory agents in mammals. The invention further relates to pharmaceutically active compositions comprising the compound of the invention and to a process for preparing the compounds of the invention. 4 Chlorohydrocortisone and 4 fluorohydrocortisone are knovm compounds. However, no biological activity is shown for these compounds. See U.S. 3,232,960 toMagerlein and Ernst Jucher, Process in Drug Research, Vol. 5, p. 50, Birkhauser Verlag Basel and Stuttart, 1963. U.S. 3,192,301 to Westerhof discloses a process for making certain steroids. At column 3 of the patent the broad formula indicates that the patent relates to compounds of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R5 and R6 may be, i.a., halogen. However, the patent does not disclose the preparation of any 4,6 dihalo steroids. U.S. Patent 3,707,537 to Kierstead discloses certain 4 chloro 6 halo pregna 4,6 dienes which require the presence of a 6 7 double bond. Another patent which discloses the possibility of certain 4,6 dihalo pregna4 enes is U.S. 3,489,748 to Benningen and Muller. These compounds differ from the compounds of this invention in that the Benningen et al compounds exhibit a 16a alkylthio group at the 16 position and have no substitution at the 17a position. Furthermore, there are no di substituted compounds disclosed, only 4 chloro pregna4,6,16 triene 3,20 dione and the corresponding 16a ethylthiopregna 4 , 6 diene. 4 Other 3 keto E steroids are also known which are 6,6 difluoro substituted. See, for example, U.S.3,219,673 U.S. 3,767,684 U.S. 3,822,253 U.S.3,681,338 U.S. 3,718,673 U.S. 3,546,215 and U.S.3,629,242. A heretofore unknown series of compounds has now been disclovered which show high topical anti inflammatory activity. One aspect of this invention is a compound chosen from those represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein xl is fluoro or chloro X2 is hydrogen, fluoro or chloro x3 is hvdroqen, fluoro, chloro or bromo X4 is C O orEMI3.2 when X3 is chloro R1 is hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, hydroxy or methoxy R2 is fluoro, chloro, bromo, hydroxy or alkanoyloxy of 2 to 6 carbon atoms when R1 is hydrogen or R2 is the same as R1 when R1is fluoro, chloro, hydroxy or methoxy R3 is hydroxy or alkanoyloxy of 2to 6 carbon atoms when R4is methyl or methyl or R3 and R together areEMI3.3 and tne sofia ana DroKen lines De tween the 1 and 2 positions in the A ring of the steroid nucleus represent a single or double bond. Another aspect of this invention is a topical anti inflammatory pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least one suitable pharmaceutical excipient in combination with a compound chosen from those represented by Formula I , above, wherein each of the substituents are as defined. Particularly valuable compounds in this composition are set forth hereafter. Still another aspect of this invention is the use of compounds of Formula for treating an inflamed condition in a mammal. Still another aspect of this invention is a process for the preparation of a compound chosen from those represented by Formula I , above, wherein the solid and broken lines between C I and C 2 represent a double or single bond. This process comprises contacting a compound represented by the formulaEMI4.1 with a base for a time sufficient to form a compound of the invention. One subgroup of the broad aspect of this invention comprises those compounds represented byFormula I wherein X1 is fluoro or chloro ss is hydrogen or fluoro X3 is hydrogen or fluoro X4 isEMI5.1 R1 is hydrogen, hydroxy,or methoxy R2 is the same as RÚ when RÚ is methoxy or hydroxy or is hydroxy, fluoro, chloro or acetoxy when R1 is hydrogen and R3 and R4 together are 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxy. Still another subgroup of this invention comprises the compounds represented by Formula I wherein X1 is fluoro or chloro ss is hydrogen or fluoro X3is hydrogen or fluoro 0 isEMI5.2 R1 is hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy R is chloro, fluoro, hydroxy or acetoxy when R1 is hydrogen or R2 is the same as R when R1 is hydroxy or methoxy R3 is 4 hydroxy or alkanoyloxy of 2 6 carbon atoms and R is methyl or 3 methyl. A subdivision of this subgroup comprises the compounds represented by Formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is fluoro, chloro, hydroxy or acetoxy and is a methyl. Preferably, in each of the subgroups set forth hereinbefore there is a double bond between C i andC 2 of the steroid ring. In naming the compounds of this invention the first substituent will be the 4 position and all other substituents on the steroid ring shall be included numerically unless there is a substitutent the same as that at the 4 position. For example, where X1 is chloro, X and X3 are fluoro, X is hydroxy, R1 is R2 3 4 hydrogen, R2 is methoxy, R and R together are 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxy and there is a double bond between C i and C 2, the name is 4 chloro 6a,9a difluoro llss hydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxy 21 methoxypregna l,4 diene 3,20 dione.If on the other hand, R3 is hydroxy and R4 is a methyl while RÚ , Rê and XÚ X4 are the same as immediately named above, the compound is named 4 chloro 6a,9a difluoro llS,17a dihydroxy 16a methyl 21 methoxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione. If, however, in the compound of Formula I , X1 andX3 are both chloro, X isEMI6.1 X is fluoro, R1is hydrogen, RZ is chloro, RJ and R together are isopropylidenedioxy, and there is a double bond between C i and C 2, the compound is 4,9a,llB,21 tetrachloro 6a fluoro 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione. The compounds of this invention are useful for the relief of inflamed conditions in mammals, and more specifically are useful for relieving inflammatory manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses in humans. Initial approximation of anti inflammatorV activity is done by following the procedure of McKenzie,S.W. and Stoughton, R.B., Method for Comparing Percutaneous Absorption of Steroids Arch Dermat, 86, 608 1962 or modifications thereof. Generally, the inflammatory manifestation in mammals, particularly humans, is combatted by treating the afflicted mammal with a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the novel steroids of this invention, that is an amount which results in improve ment of the inflamed condition. Preferably the steroids are first formulated to prepare a suitable pharmaceutical formulation, as discussed hereinafter, which is then placed in contact with the afflicted area. A therapeutically effective amount will depend upon the particular condition and the mammal receiving the treatment but will vary between 0.001 to 10 by weight of the pharmaceutical composition and preferably will be between 0.01 and 1 by weight of the formulation.Using these levels in the formulation, a therapeutically effective, nonside effect producing amount, i.e. enough to effect an anti inflammatory response, but not enough to adversely effect the recipient, is applied to the inflamed area. The compounds of this invention not only have antiinflammatory activity but also exhibit a low level of systemic activity, as measured by recognized laboratory assays. This allows for the application of an effective amount of the anti inflammatory compounds with little adverse effect on the rest of the mammal s system. The novel steroids of this invention may be formulated with suitable pharmaceutical excipients known in the art to form particularly effective anti inflammatory compositions. Generally an effective amount of the steroid is about 0.001 w to about 10 w of the total formulated composition. The rest of the formulated composition will be about 90 w to about 99.999 w of suitable excipients which may include a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent and other pharmaceutically acceptable additives to form an effective pharmaceutical formulation. A pharmaceutically acceptable solvent is one which is substantially non toxic and non irritating under the conditions used and may be readily formulated into any of the classical dr ug formulations such as powders, creams, ointments, lotions, gels, foams, suppositories, aerosols, solutions or the like. Particularly suitable solvents include water, glycerine, propylene carbonate, and a glycol such as 1,2 propylene diol i.e. propylene glycol , 1,3 propylene diol, polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 100 to 10,000, dipropylene glycol, etc. and mixtures of the aforementioned with each other. A topical cream may be prepared as a semi solid emulsion of oil in water or water in oil. A cream base formulation by definition is an emulsion which is a two phase system with one liquid for example fats or oils being dispersed as small globules in another substance e.g., a glycol water solvent phase which may be employed as the primary solvent for the novel steroids therein, the cream formulation may contain fatty alcohols, surfactants, mineral oil or petrolatum and other typical pharmaceutical adjuvants such as anti oxidants, antieptics, or compatible adjuvants.A typical cream base formulation is given in the following table Water glycol mixture 50 99 parts by weight 15 or more glycol Fatty alcohol 1 20 Non ionic Surfactant 0 10 Mineral oil 0 10 Typical pharmaceutical 0 5 adjuvants Active Ingredients 0.001 10 The fatty alcohol, non ionic surfactant, and other adjuvants are discussed in U.S. 3,934,013 to Poulsen which is incorporated herein by reference. The novel steroids of this invention may also be formulated as ointments. A classical ointment is a semisolid anhydrous composition which may contain mineral oil, white petrolatum, a suitable solvent such as a glycol and may include propylene carbonate and other pharmaceutically suitable additives such as surfactants, for example Span and Tween, or wool fat lanolin , along with stabilizers such as antioxidants and other adjuvants as mentioned before.Following is an example of a typical classical ointment base White petrolatum 40 94 parts by weight Mineral Oil 5 20 Glycol solvent 1 15 Surfactant 0 10 Stabilizer 0 10 Active Ingredients 0.001 10.0 Other suitable ointment base formulations which employ propylene carbonate are described in U.S. patent 4,017,615 issued April 12, 1977 by Shastri et al entitled Propylene Carbonate Ointment Vehicle and U.S.3,924,004 issued December 2, 1975 by Chang et al entitled Fatty Alcohol Propylene Carbonate GlycolSolvent Cream Vehicle .

A suitable non classical anhydrous, water washable ointment type base is described in U.S.Patent No. 3,952,930 to Katz and Neiman, and that patent is incorporated herein by reference. A representative composition of this invention utilizing such a base is as follows Glycol solvent 40 35 parts by height Fatty alcohol 15 45 Compatible plasticizer 0 15 Compatible coupling 0 15 Agent Penetrant 0 20 Active Ingredients 0.001 10.0 The novel compounds of this invention are ultimately obtained by converting a compound represented by Formula IV to the corresponding compound of this invention represented by Formula I wherein X1, Xê , X 4 R1, R2 R3 and R are defined hereinbefore. The overall process for preparing the pregna l,4 dienes compounds of the invention is a three step process which is illustrated by the following reaction sequence, wherein X is chloro, fluoro or bromo and the other substituents are defined hereinbefore for the broadest aspect of the invention.EMI10.1 EMI11.1 In the first step a compound represented by formula II is reacted to form a compound of the formula III wherein Y is methoxy or ethoxy. If, in the starting compound represented by formula it , R is hydroxy andR1 is hydrogen then R2 should be protected by acetylation or some similar means. If there is a hydroxy at the 11 position it is preferable that this hydroxy is also protected by acetylation or the like. Protection of both positions is readily accomplished by reacting the compound represented by II with acetic anhydride in pyridine and triethylamine in the preence of catalytic amounts of dimethyl pyridine at about 100 to about 1000C, preferably at room temperature, to give a compound of formula IIa EMI11.2 where R5 and R6 are eachEMI11.3 Although such protection is not needed in the case of the 11B hydroxy, it does improve the yield. If compound II is a 17a,21 dihydroxypregna 1,4diene where R4 is methyl or hydrogen, it is preferably reacted with acid aqueous formaldehyde to form the 17a,21 20,21 bis methylenedioxy compound of the formulaEMI12.1 Thus both the 17 and 21 hydroxy moieties are protected from reaction. Once the hydroxy groups, if any, are protected, compound it , IIa or IIb is reacted with, for example, a large excess of trimethyl orthoformate in methanol or triethyl orthoformate in ethanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable acid catalyst, such as fuming sulfuric acid, at reflux temperature or less. About 50 550C is preferred. Generally the molar ratio of trimethyl orthoformate or triethyl orthoformate to the compound represented by formula II , IIa or IIb is about 10 1 to about 30 1, preferably about 10 1 to 15 1.Once the reaction is complete a base is added to neutralize the acid and the resulting enol ether represented by formula III or the enol ether corresponding to the compound represented by formulas IIa or Ilb where Y is methoxy or ethoxy is recovered and purified using methods well known in the art such as evaporation, recrystallization, etc. The enol ether is then fluorinated or chlorinated using perchloryl fluoride C1Q3F or trifluoromethoxy fluoride CF30F as a fluorinating agent, a source of positive chlorine such as N chlorosuccinimide, dichioro hydantoin, etc. as a chlorinating agent, to form the 3 keto 4a fluoro chloro pregna 1,5 diene represented by formula IV or the 3 keto 4a fluoro chloro pregna1,5 diene corresponding to the compound represented by formulas IIa or lIb . In the case of ClO3F, which is a gas, an approximately equimolar amount 1 to 1.1 moles ClO3F per mole of the enol ether is metered in to a mixture of the enol ether in a solution which is a major amount of acetone, preferably 90 by weight, and a minor amount of water, preferably about 10 over a period of about 1 3 hours at lO 300C, preferably ambient temperature.Dichlorohydantoin is similarly reacted. The compound of formula IV ,or the corresponding compound from formula IIa or IIb , is reacted in an inert atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen, with a suitable base such as an alkali metal carbonate, e.g. potassium carbonate, in a suitable oxygenated hydrocarbon solvent such as an alkanol, e.g. methanol1 to cause a rearrangement to take place to form the desired 4 fluoro 4 chloro 3 keto pregna 1,4 diene. If appropriate, the protecting groups at the llB,17a and or 21 positions are hydrolyzed using a suitable base such as 1 molar sodium hydroxide if the treatment with, e.g. potassium carbonate is not sufficient. Where X is fluoro, chloro or bromo, potassium carbonate is generally sufficient for hydrolysis of the llS acetoxy group. In the case of the 9a chloro or 9a bromo llB hydroxy compound, the treatment with potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide may form a 9,11 epoxide. This can be converted to the 9,11 chlorohydrin or 9,11 bromohydrin compound by reacting the 9,11 epoxide with hydrochloric or hydro bromic acid in chloroform respectively. The BMD compound is hydrolyzed using a suitable acid such as 60 formic acid or 48 hydrofluoric acid. Once the final pregna 1,4 diene is obtained, the compound may be readily selectively hydrogenated across the 1 2 bond by any suitable means known in the art to 4 obtain the corresponding A4 3 keto steroid. To prepare the 4 halopregn 4 enes of formula I of this invention wherein X3 is hydrogen, a slightly modified route is required as set forth in the following reaction sequence EMI14.1 In this sequence, the starting 3 keto pregn 4 ene represented by formula II is first reacted with a suitable amine such as pyrrolidine to form the enamine represented by Formula III . This reaction takes place readily at reflux temperatures in a suitable inert organic solvent such as benzene or methanol. The enamine represented by formula III is then fluorinated or chlorinated according to the procedure set forth above to form the 4a fluoro chloro 3 ketopregn 5 ene of formula IV which in turn is treated with, e.g. potassium carbonate in methanol under N2, to shift the double bond to the 4 position thus giving a compound of this invention represented by I . The resulting 3 keto pregn 4 ene is readily dehydrogenated at the l position by methods known in the art such as using 2,3 dichloro 4,6 dicyano 1,4 benzoquinone in dioxane. Any protecting groups at 11 beta , 17a , or 21 are readily hydrolyzed by methods discussed hereinbefore. More specific embodiments of the process of this invention are given hereafter in the Examples.Preparation Of Starting Compounds As pointed out above, starting compounds for the process of preparing the compounds of this invention are represented by the formulas 11 or II wherein the substituents are described hereinbefore for each of the respective formulas and are either known per se or are readily prepared using known techniques.For example, pregna 1,4,9 11 trienes are treated with chlorine according to the process of U.S. 3,009,933 to give the corresponding 9a,118 dichloropregna 1,4 diene. The 9a bromo llss hydroxy or 9a chloroo hydroxy compounds are prepared by reacting the appropriate pregna1,4,9 11 triene with dibromohydantoin or N,N dichloro dimethylhydantoin to form the 9a bromohydrin or ga,llS chlorohydrin, respectively. The 9a,11ss bromo hydrin steroid is in turn reacted with sodium hydroxide to give the corresponding 9B,11B epoxide which is then treated with a hydrogen fluoride urea complex according to the process set forth in U.S. 3,211,758 to Tarkoey to give the 9 fluoro llss hydroxy compound. An 11f3 hydroxy unsubstituted steroid is readily prepared from a 3 keto 6a optionally substituted pregna1,4 diene or pregn 4 ene by methods well known in the art such as employing Cunninghamella blakesleeana,Cunninghamella bainieri, Curvularia Lunata, or other suitable micro organisms in ethanol which selectively affords the desired llS hydroxy steroid. 16a,17a Isopropylidenedioxy pregna 1,4,9 11 trienes are known or can readily be prepared by reacting an llss hydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxypregna 1,4 diene with thionyl chloride in pyridine at OOC. A 17ahydroxypregna 1,4 9 ll triene is prepared by reacting the corresponding 11B,17a dihydroxy pregna 1,4 diene with methane sulfonyl chloride in pyridine with S03 at about OOC or with methyl chlorosulfinate prepared by distilling methanol with thionyichloride in tetrahydrofuran and pyridine at 780C and allowing the reaction mixture to slowly warm to ambient temperature. A 16 ,17a isopropylidenedioxy group is readily introduced by treating the corresponding 16a,17a dihydroxy steroid with acetone in the presence of perchloric acid. The 16a,17 dihydroxy groups are introduced by treating a pregn 16 ene derivative with potassium permanganate, acetone and acetic acid. A 16 methyl group is introduced by treating the corresponding 20 keto pregn 16 ene steroid with methyl magnesium bromide in the presence of cuprous chloride in an ether such as tetrahydrofuran. The 20 keto pregn16 ene steroid is prepared by preparing the 3,20 bissemicarbazone of a 3,20 diketo 17a hydroxy steroid, treating it with glacial acetic acid and acetic anhydride and then allowing the resulting product to react with aqueous pyruvic acid. The 17a hydroxy group is introduced in conjunction with the 16 methyl group by first treating the corresponding 16 methyl pregn 16 ene steroid which is prepared by treating the corresponding pregn 16 ene steroid with diazomethane and then heating the resulting product to 1800C. with hydrogen perioxide, in an aqueous basic media, then permitting the resulting 16,17 oxido 16methyl steroid to react with hydrogen bronide in glacial acetic acid. The resulting olefin is hydrogenated with the use of a palladium catalyst to afford the corresponding 16a methyl 17a hydroxy derivative. The 21chloro, bromo or fluoro group is introduced by treating a 21 hydroxy steroid derivative with methanesulfonyl chloride in pyridine, then refluxing the resulting 21 mesylate ester with lithium chloride or lithium bromide in sulfolane at 1350C to get the corresponding 21 chloro or bromo steroid derivative.The 21 fluoro steroid is obtained by refluxing the 21 bromide with potassium fluoride in sulfolane at 1350C. Preferably the 21 bromo compound is isolated before preparing the 21 fluoro compound. Further discussion of the preparation of these 21 halo steroids can be found in U.S. 3,053,830 to Fried. The 21 acyloxy compounds are readily prepared by reacting the known corresponding 21 hydroxy compounds, e.g. prednisolone, with the desired alkanoyl chloride or, preferably, anhydride and an organic base, e.g.pyridine. The 21,21 dihalo steroids are readily prepared according to the processes disclosed in U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 711,042 filed August 2, 1976 by formylating an appropriate 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxy pregna l,4,9 ll triene 3,20 dione with ethyl formate in a hindered base to form a hydroxymethylene group at 21 halogenating at 21 with, e.g., lithium chloride, cupric bromide, or perchloryl fluoride to form a 21,21 dihalo 21 formyl and deformylating with sodium hydroxide to form the 21,21 dihalo steroid. To prepare the 21,21 dihydroxy and 21,21 dialkoxy steroids useful as starting materials, the process set forth in U.S. 4,011,315 is particularly useful and that patent is incorporated herein by reference. In this process, an appropriate 21 hydroxy steroid is contacted with air in the presence of a copper II catalyst such as cupric acetate to yield the 21,21 dihydroxy steroid i.e. a 21 aldehyde hydrate . The rection is preferably conducted in methanol at a temperature of 500 to 300C for a period of 30 minutes to 60 hours. The 21 aldehyde hydrate can then be isolated according to methods known in the art or may then be heated under vacuum at a temperature of 1000C for a period of 30 minutes to 3 hours to yield the 21 aldehyde which is reacted with a lower alkanol containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably methanol, at a temperature of 200 to 60QC for a period of 15 minutes to 1 hour to yield a 21 aldehyde hemiacetal. Reaction of the 21 aldehyde hemiacetal with a suitable halogenating agent such as methane sulfonyl chloride, thionyl chloride, or thionyl bromide in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine, pyridine and the like yields the 21 halo 21 alkyl ether. The reaction is preferably conducted in a chlorinated organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, l,l dichloroethane and the like for a period of l to 16 hours and a temperature of 20 to 100C.The thus obtained 21 halo 21 alkyl ether is then treated with an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably a sodium alkoxide such as sodium methoxide. The reaction is conducted in a solvent medium usually containing the alkanol corresponding to the alkoxide utilized although a solvent inert to the other reactants may be employed. Reaction temperatures are preferably maintained at 200 to 600C for a period of 2 to 6 hours. By following the procedures set forth above for preparing the starting material for the compounds of this invention, steroids of a relatively simple structure can be converted to other structures as desired. Thus, exemplary known compounds which can be employed to prepare starting materials for compounds of this invention according to procedures discussed above include progesterone, corticosterone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, betametbasone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone, paramethasone, fluocinolone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, and the like. Further specific embodiments of this invention are found in the following examples which are given by way of illustration only and are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the claims appended hereto. Example 1 This example sets forth a process for preparing 4,6a,9a trifluoro llss hydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidene dioxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 diones which are substituted at the 21 position according to the following reaction sequence EMI19.1 EMI20.1 A. Preparation of 4,6a,9a trifluoro llB,21 dihydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione. Ten grams g fluocinolone acetonide 6a,9a difluoro 11, 21 dihydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxy pregna l,4 diene 3,20 dione is stirred into 5 milliliters ml of acetic anhydride, 5 ml triethylamine and 1 g 4 N,N dimethylamino pyridine at room temperature for 5 hours to form the corresponding 11S,21 diacetate X2 and X3 are F, X4is EMI20.2 R2 is acetoxy and R is H which is then recovered by precipitation in water and filtration. To a solution of 620 ml trimethyl orthoformate, 206 ml anhydrous methanol, and 4.1 ml fuming sulfuric acid, 42 g of the 11B,21 diacetate of fluocinolone acetonide prepared according to the preceeding paragraph is added. The resulting mixture is stirred at 50 550C for 30 minutes, at which time thin layer chromatography TLC using an eluant of 35 ethyl acetate and 65 hexane shows that the reaction is complete. Twenty five ml of triethyl amine are added to neutralize the acid and the solvents are removed using a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure.The residue is dissolved in 500 ml of acetone, about 25 ml water is added and the acetone is removed under reduced pressure to give crystalline precipitate which is collected by filtration and air dried overnight to give 40 g. of compound III , above, wherein R1 is hydrogen, R2 is acetoxy, R4 isEMI21.1 and X2 and X3 are F. Thirty g of the resulting product is added to 300 ml of a solvent consisting of 90 by weight w acetone and 10 w water and molar equivalent of perchloryl fluoride C103F is added at ambient temperature over about 30 minutes. TLC of the reaction mixture using a mixture of 35 ethyl acetate and 65 hexane shows the reaction to be complete upon completion of the ClO3F addition. Water is slowly added to the reaction mixture until a total volume of 2 1 is obtained. A crystalline precipitate forms which is collected by filtration, dissolved in 300 ml methylene chloride CH2C12 and the resulting solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.The product represented by IV1 wherein R1 is hydrogen R2 is acetoxy X1, Xz and X3 are F and X4 isEMI21.2 is purified by chromatography on 300 g column of silica gel, eluting with a mixture of 75 CH2Cl2 and 25 hexane.

The pure product is isolated by column chromatography on silica gel to give 4,6a,9a,21 tetrafluoro llss hydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione. Similarly, by substituting other A1,4 steroids of this invention made according to Examples 1 22 for the compound of formula I23 , other corresponding steroids are prepared such as 4 chloro 6a fluoro llss hydroxy 16a methyl 17a propionyloxy 21 acetoxypregna 1, 4 diene 3 , 20 dione. Example 20 This example sets forth a process for preparing an ll keto compound of this invention by oxidizing any of the llss hydroxy steroids set forth in Examples 1 19. One g of 4,6a,9a,21 tetrafluoro llss hydroxy 16a,17 isopropylidenedioxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione is dissolved in 50 ml of acetone and treated at room temperature with Jones reagent chromic anhydride in dilute sulfuric acid dropwise until TLC indicates the absence of starting material. The mixture is treated with five drops of isopropyl alcohol to destroy any excess of reagent, then diluted with 50 ml of water and the mixture concentrated under vacuum under reduced pressure to give a crystalline material, namely 4,6a,9a,21 tetrafluoro 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxypregna 1,4 diene 3,11,20 trione. Example 21 This example sets forth a process for converting aA4 steroid to a A1,4 steroid. A mixture of 0.5 g of 4,6a difluoro 11S,21 dihydroxy 16 ,17 isopropylidenedioxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione, 10 ml of dioxane and 0.35 g. of 2,3 dichloro5,6 dicyano 1,4 benzoquinone is refluxed for 10 hours.The mixture is then cooled, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in acetone and this solution is then filtered through 10 g of alumina and concentrated to yield 4,6a difluoro llss,21 dihydroxy 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione which is further purified by recrystallization from acetone hexane. Example 22 This example sets forth an alternative route to the 16methyl steroid of this invention. A. Ten 10 g of 6a fluoro 166 methyl 17a,21 diacetoxypregna 1,4,9 11 triene 3,20 dione in 110 ml of dioxane A.R. plus 2.2 mls of a solution of 4.4 ml 70 HC104 in 200 mls of H2O, treated with 4 g of dibromantoin in the dark at R.T. for a period of one hour, when TLC in 50 ethyl acetate 50 hexane shows the reaction to be complete. The reaction mixture is precipitated in 2 1 of water, stirred for 10 minutes and the crystalline precipitate collected by filtration, washed with water, and air dried to give 11.4 g of 6 fluoro 9a bromo llss hydroxy 165 methyl 17a,21 diacetoxy pregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione.This bromohydrin 19.1 g is mixed with 286 ml of methyl orthoformate, 96 ml of anhydrous methanol and 1.9 ml of fuming sulfuric acid and heated on a water bath at 50 550C for 15 minutes.The mixture is treated with 15 ml of pyridine and poured into 300 ml of water, separated and washed three times with water. The resulting mixture is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under high vacuum to a foam which is left in crushed dry ice for 16 hours to give the ll orthoester of 3 methoxy 6a fluoro 9a bromo 165 methyl 17a,21 diacetoxypregna 1,3,5 6 triene 20 one. The orthoester so obtained is dissolved in 300 ml of a mixture of 80 THF 20 water and treated at room temperature with a slow stream of ClO3F until no more starting material is detected by TLC analysis. The mixture is diluted with water and the organic solvent eliminated under reduced pressure high vacuum at 50 550C.The mixture is diluted with water up to 2 liters and kept in the refrigerator for 20 hours. The resulting precipitate is filtered and dried. One 1 g of crude reaction mixture is dissolved in about 20 ml of methylene dichloride MDC and filtered through a 10 g column of silica with 100 MDC. The column is eluted with 1.2 liters of MDC, then with 2 ethyl acetate 98 MDC. The homgeneous fractions containing small amounts of negative and positive polar impurities are concentrated to dryness under high vacuum. NMR analysis of the negative polar product eluted indicates that the product is 4,6a difluoro 9a bromo 11B hydroxy 16B methyl 17a,21 diacetoxypregna l,5 6 diene 3,20 dione. The resulting product is mixed with tin tributylhydride in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature to eliminate the 9a bromine and form 4,6a difluoro 115 hydroxy 16ss methyl 17a,21 diacetoxypregna 1,4 6 3,20 dione. The reaction may be accelerated by adding a small amount of a free radical and refluxing. The resulting product is stirred with methanol containing anhydrous potassium carbonate under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature untilTLC shows the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is diluted with methanol and glacial acetic acid and concentrated under reduced pressure to a small volume.The crystalline precipitate which forms is collected by filtration and washed with methanol and water to give 4,6a difluoro llss,17a,21 trihydroxy 16ss methylpregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione.

The latter is then mixed with the other ingredients at 80 850C to give the desired formulation. Example 24 LD50 Six Swiss Webster mice Simonsen each weighing about 25 grams, were injected subcutaneously with a solution of 4,6a,9a trifluoro llB hydroxy 16,17a isopropylidenedioxypregna l, 4 diene 3 , 20 dione in carbomethoxycellulose having a concentration of 10 ml kg. The dosage was 25 mg kg or about .625 mg mouse.The mice were observed daily for mortality for 21 days.No mice died. The LD50 is, therefore, more than 25 mg kg. Example 25 Biological ActivityAnti inflammatory Activity This example sets forth the results of the topical anti inflammatory activity of compounds of this invention. The topical anti inflammatory activity potential for each compound was asayed using a modifiedStoughton McKenzie vaso constriction assay in humans, i.e., McKenzie, W.W. and Stoughton, R.B. Method forComparing Percutaneous Absorption of Steroids Arch.Dermat. 86, 608 1962 . Eight normal adult human subjects were treated on four sites on each forearm by topical administration with alcoholic solutions containing 1 X 10 5 and 1 X 10 6 g ml of each of the compounds to provide 64 total test sites for each compound in a series 32 for each concentration . Areas of the subjects forearms were outlined by a rubber stamp grid coated with silicone grease, and 10 microliters of each solution were applied per 7x7 mm square site. After the preparations dried, the areas on each forearm are covered with SaranR wrap and the margins sealed with tape. The occlusive wrap is removed after 18 hours.Twenty four hours after application, the presence or absence of vasoconstriction is noted by visual examination by two independent observers, and expressed as the number of sites responding vasoconstriction and is calculated as a percentage of the total number of sites. Also, the intensity of the vasoconstriction is scored on a 0, 1, 2 scale, 2 being the most intense reaction. Both scores are used in the constructing dose response graphs according to methods set forth in an article by Place, V.A. et al entitled Precise Evaluation of Topically AppliedCorticosteroid Potency , Arch Derm, 101, 531 537 1970 . The activity is determined relative to fluocinolone acetonide PA . If the compound exhibits activity in the range of 0.1 times the activity of FA, it is an active compound.Thymolytic Activity The compounds to be tested, including a hydrocortisone standard, were prepared in three or more concentra tions by suspension in a sodium carboxymethylcellulose vehicle. Animals received the test materials by subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml of the suspension on each of three successive days. Four hours following the final injection, the rats were sacrificed and the thymus gland of each animal removed and weighed and a determination of activity relative to hydrocortisone BC obtained. HC has low thymolytic activity. Generally, the compounds of this invention show high anti inflammatory activity but low thymolytic activity, thus exhibiting a therapeutic advantage over compounds of the art.
