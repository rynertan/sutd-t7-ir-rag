# Fastening railway rails.

## Abstract
A railway sleeper is in the form of an inverted trough narrrower at the top 16 than at the bottom and having a gap 13 in its upper side. The sleeper supports a rail 14 with the bottom of a flange 15 , which is at the bottom of the rail, in the gap and lower than the top of the sleeper. The rail is secured by a clip D , part of which is inside the sleeper and constrained by the narrowness of the top of the sleeper so that the clip cannot turn through a large angle about a vertical axis. The rail may be further secured by a portion 17 of the sleeper overhanging one side of the flange. The clip may be a bent bar of the same cross section throughout its length and comprising a short upper limb A and a longer lower limb B , slightly arched 1A and ending in an up turned part 9 , the limbs extending generally in the same direction from a bend C which joins them.

## Description
Fastening Railway Rails According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a railway sleeper in the form of an inverted trough which has at least one of its two side walls inclined to the vertical so that the sleeper is narrower at the top than it is at the bottom, the sleeper having a gap in its upper side such that the sleeper can support a railway rail with the bottom of a flange, which is at the bottom of the rail, in said gap and lower than the top of the sleeper. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an assembly comprising a railway sleeper in the form of an inverted trough which has at least one of its two side walls inclined to the vertical so that the sleeper is narrower at the top than it is at the bottom, the sleeper having a gap in its upper side, a railway rail having the bottom of a flange, which is at the bottom of the rail, in said gap and lower than the top of the sleeper and a clip engaging the sleeper and one side of the flange and holding the rail down, the clip having a part inside the sleeper at its top, said part being constrained by the narrowness of the top of the sleeper so that the clip cannot turn through a large angle about a vertical axis. Part of the top of the sleeper could overhang and hold down the other side of the flange of the rail. According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a clip which is suitable for use in an assembly according to the second aspect of the invention, the clip comprising a bent steel bar having substantially the same..shape of cross section over its entire length and having a long lower limb and, above it, a shorter upper limb, the two limbs extending in the same general direction as one another away from a bend which joins them and there being an up turned part at that end of.the lower limb which is remote from the bend, the lower limb being slightly arched. Examples in accordance with the invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 show an end view and a side view, respectively, of part of an assembly in a railway track, Figure 3 shows a perspective view of another such assembly, and Figures 4 and 5 show an end view and a plan view, respectively, of part.of a third such assembly. A clip D shown in Figures 1 and 2 has been made by bending a bar of resilient steel. The shape of cross section of the bar is substantially rectangular and substantially the same over the whole length of the bent bar, although there are small and unavoidable departures from the truly rectangular cross section, due to the bending process. The clip consists of two limbs A and B extending in the same general direction as one another to the right, considering Figure 1 away from a bend C which joins them, the limb B being below the limb A and longer than the limb A.When the clip is placed in the particular position in which it is illustrated and it is free from stress, a first portion 1 of it, which extends over by far the greater part of the length of the clip, is nearly straight, being slightly arched at 1A, and horizontal, the left hand end of the first portion being adjoined by a second portion 2 which extends upwardly and to the left, this being followed by a third portion 3 which extends upwardly, then a fourth portion 4 which extends upwardly and to the right, then a fifth portion 5 which extends to the right, a sixth portion 6 which extends downwardly and to the right, a seventh portion 7 which extends to the right and an eighth portion 8 which extends upwardly and to the right.The right hand end of the arch in the first portion 1 is adjoined by a ninth portion 9 which extends upwardly and to the right at an angle of between 300 and BOO, in the illustrated case about 65 to the horizontal. Figures 1 and 2 show a steel railway sleeper in the form of an inverted trough of triangular crosssection. The side walls of the trough are referenced 11 and 12. Both of them are inclined to the vertical although in principle one could be vertical and the other inclined to the vertical so that the sleeper is narrower at the top than it is at the bottom. A part has been cut out of the sleeper to form a gap 13. Portions have been cut out of the side walls and parts of the side walls, between the cut out portions, have been bent over inwardly to form ledges llA and 12A. A railway rail 14 of a light weight narrow gauge railway has a flange 15 at its foot and the bottom of the flange lies in the gap 13 and lies on the ledges llA and 12A, whereas a portion 15A of the flange, between the side walls 11 and 12, has no part of the trough vertically beneath it.The whole of the flange 15 is lower than the top 16 of the sleeper.The rail is located by vertical faces 21 and 22, and above the faces 21 there are inclined faces 23, one on each of the side walls 11 and 12, to assist the operation of placing the rail in position. A portion 17 of the sleeper overhangs the flange 15 on one side of the rail, i.e. the side nearer the other rail which lies on the same sleeper, and holds the rail down on that side. The other side of the rail is held down by the clip D, of which the junction between the parts 1A and 9 bears downwardly on the upper face of the flange. The clip is initially put, in a factory or depot, in a preparatory position, to the left of the position shown in Figure 1, with the legs A and B of the clip forced apart by the sleeper and the free end of the portion 9 of the clip vertically below the portion 18 of the top of the sleeper, the portion 7 of the clip engaging the top of the sleeper near the top of a ramp 19 on the sleeper. This ramp prevents the clip falling away from the sleeper when it is held in various positions during storage, transportation and assembly.When the sleeper and the rail have been positioned as shown, the clip is driven to the right to the illustrated position, where the portion 7 of the clip is still on the ramp 19, which prevents the clip from moving to the left In contrast to what is shown in Figure 1, the ramp 19 is preferably inclined to the horizontal by an angle equal to or greater than the angle which the upper face of the flange 15 makes with the horizontal. In a modified version of what is shown in Figure 1, the top of the sleeper at its extreme left hand end is flat and horizontal and the left hand end of the ramp 19 is a few millimetres from the left hand end of the sleeper. At the other end of the sleeper there is a clip on the right hand side of the other rail and an overhanging portion 17 on the left hand side. However, because the overhanging portions 17 are on the left hand side of one rail and on the right hand side of the other rail, there are difficulties when it is desired to replace a single sleeper without dismantling joints between adjacent lengths of rail and this can be done only by turning the rails about their longitudinal axes. In contrast, Figure 3 shows an assembly in which it is only necesary to remove the clips, raise the rails and the sleeper vertically, remove the sleeper from the rails, put a new sleeper in its place on the rails, lower the rails and the sleeper and re insert the clips. Each of the overhanging portions 17 is on the left hand side of its associated rail, the right hand clip, which is substantially as shown in Figure 1, being driven into position as described above with reference to Figure 1 and the other clip, of exactly the same shape as the right hand clip, being positioned by inserting its leg B into a hole 25 which passes through the flat top 16 of the sleeper. The portion 7 of this clip is caused to engage the top of a ramp 19 or a flat horizontal surface 26 between the top of the ramp and the hole 25 and then the clip is driven to the left into a position where its portion 9 bears upon the flange of the rail. If the right hand end of the sleeper is inconveniently far from the nearest rail, so that if the right hand clip were to be positioned as shown in Figure 3 the clip would have to be inconveniently long, the right hand clip could have its leg B inserted in a hole like the hole 25, between the rail and the end of the sleeper. In the example shown in Figures 4 and 5 the sleeper has the same shape of cross section as that shown in Figure 3 and two gaps 13 and one hole 25 in its top.The example differs from that shown in Figures 1 and 2 as follows. A rib 28 extends across the top of the sleeper to prevent the clip moving away from the rail and the portion 7 of the clip bears on the flat top of the sleeper between this rib and the end of the sleeper in the above mentioned preparatory position of the clip.The top of the arched portion 1A of the clip is vertically below the bottom of the portion 7. The gap 13 is bounded by vertical faces 30 below which there are inclined faces 31 and the portion 17 has a slightly different shape. The clip D for the right hand rail is shown, inserted through a hole 25, and there is an overhanging portion 17 on the other side of the right hand rail. Instead of there being the overhanging portions 17, which is an arrangement which is particularly useful for railways in mines, there could if desired, for mine railways and other narrow gauge railways or even wider gauge railways, be four clips per sleeper. All four could have their limbs B inserted in holes like the hole 25 or the arrangement could be that only the clips which are between the rails have their limbs B inserted into holes, whilst the other clips are positioned as shown in Figure 1. The sleepers shown in Figures 3 to 5 could have the ledges llA and 12A, as in the example according toFigures 1 and 2. In all three examples, the parts of the side walls of the sleeper between the above mentioned cut out portions could be bent over outwardly, instead of inwardly, to form the ledges llA and 12A, in other words the ledges could extend away from one another instead of towards one another as shown in Figure 2. Figures 3 to 5 also show outwardly directed flanges 27 at the bottom of the side walls 11 and 12 of the sleeper, in order to strengthen the sleeper. These flanges could be provided on the sleeper shown in Figures 1 and 2. In all three examples each clip has a width which is equal to or slightly less than the width of the interior of the top of the sleeper so that part of the clip which is inside the sleeper is contrained so that the clip cannot turn, or can turn through only a few degrees, preferably no more than ten degrees, about a vertical axis.
