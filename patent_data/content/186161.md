# CANISTER FOR CONSOLIDATION OF NUCLEAR FUEL RODS

## Abstract
A canister for the consolidation of nuclear fuel rods 22 comprises an elongated, tapered box 24 of generally rectangular cross section having upper 42 and lower 44 internal sections, the upper section having rectangular grid structure 46 and the lower section having vertically extend ing plate members 48 . The upper section receives indi vidual fuel rods in a relatively loosely packed rectangular array of rows and columns and urges the rods closer together as they are lowered into the box, such that the rods emerge through the lower end of the grid section in a relatively tightly rectangular array. The number of plate members 48 in the lower section corresponds to the number of rows of fuel rods in the upper section. Each plate has tapered side edges 204 abutting the tapered box, and a plurality of integrally formed, corrugated channels 206 corresponding to the number of rows of fuel rods. These channels guide the fuel rods into the triangularly pitched array, and the decreasing space between adjacent plates causes the fuel rods to move closer together as they move through the box. At the lower edge 202 of each plate the corrugations form a periodic series of alternating convex 208 and concave 210 arches such that each concave arch on one plate faces a concave arch on the adjacent plate. At their closest spacing, the edges of adjacent arches are separated by a distance substantially equal to a fuel rod diameter.
