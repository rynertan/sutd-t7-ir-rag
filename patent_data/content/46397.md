# Process for producing trimellitic acid or pyromellitic acid.

## Abstract
Trimellitic acid or pyromellitic acid is produced by li quid phase air oxidation of at least one of 2,4 dimethylbenz aldehyde, 3,4 dimethylbenzaldehyde and 2,5 dimethylbenz aldehyde or 2,4,5 trimethylbenzaldehyde respectively in acetic acid as solvent in the presence of cobalt, manganese and bromine as catalyst at a total concentration of the cobalt and the manganese of 0.05 0.5 by weight on the basis of the acetic acid and a reaction temperature of 180 240 C in a reactor of perfect mixing type, where the oxida tion is smoothly carried out and intended acid is produced in high yield.
