# Collapsible tripods.

## Abstract
First and second legs 4 and 5 of a collapsible tripod 1 are pivoted to a third leg 6 and interconnected by two interpivoted bracing links 15 and 16 . To swing the first and second legs 4 and 5 towards and away from the third leg 6 , first and second tie mem bers 24 and 25 extend, respectively, from the first and second legs 4 and 5 to an actuating member 18 which is movable longitudinally of the third leg 6 . To prevent relative movement between the legs 4, 5 and 6 when the tripod 1 is in its extended condition, a control link 32 extends from the pivotal interconnec tion between the two bracing links 15 and 16 and the actuating member 18 and locking means 21 are pro vided for releasably locking the actuating means 18 to the third leg 6 .
