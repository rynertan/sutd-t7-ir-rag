## Description
This invention relates to the preparation of 4 amino pyridinedicarboxylic acids and esters having fluoroalkyl substitution at the 2 and 6 positions. Pyridine derivatives and derivatives of nicotinic acid have been investigated for many years for use in the biological sciences. Such compounds have been prepared by a variety of methods. In U.S. Patent 3,748,334 there is disclosed a method of preparation of a 4 hydroxy 2,6 bis trifluoromethyl pyridine by cyclization of a heptanetrione of the formula A method of obtaining a 2 or 6 fluoroalkyl 3 pyridinemonocarboxylate compound is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,534,056. This method involves the reaction of nicotinic acid N oxide with hexafluoropropene. The product obtained is a mixture of the 2 and 6 substituted tetrafluoroethyl nicotinic acid. An object of this invention is to provide novel methods for preparing the novel pyridine compounds useful as herbicides. The novel compounds prepared by the process of this invention are useful as herbicides or intermediates in the preparation of herbicides and are represented by the generic formula R is lower alkyl R₁ and R₂ are independently selected from fluorinated and chlorofluorinated lower alkyl radicals and R₃ is independently selected from lower alkyl, aralkyl, and cycloalkyl. The term alkyl means both straight and branched chain radicals which include, but are not limited to, ethyl, methyl, n propyl, 1 ethylpropyl, 1 methylpropyl, n butyl, 2,2 dimethylpropyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, isobutyl, isopropyl. The term cycloalkyl means saturated cyclic radicals such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl. The term lower alkyl herein means an alkyl radical having 1 to 7 carbon atoms. The term fluorinated alkyl means alkyl radicals having one or more fluorine atoms attached thereto including radicals wherein all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine. The term chlorofluorinated alkyl means an alkyl radical having at least one hydrogen replaced by fluorine and at least one other hydrogen replaced by chlorine. The term aralkyl means alkyl substituted aryl radicals such as benzyl and the like. The process of preparation of pyridine dicarboxylate compounds of the present invention is shown schematically in the route below. In the process, a pentane 3 one dioate ester, also referred to as an acetonedicarboxylate, is reacted with an appropriate primary amine in a suitable reaction medium to provide a 3 amino 2 pentenedicarboxylate enamine diester . The reaction medium employed in this step is not narrowly critical the acetonedicarboxylate may be employed alone or a solvent such as an ether may be used. The reaction proceeds smoothly at low temperatures 0 50 C although temperatures up to reflux may be used. The reaction is exothermic. The reaction proceeds in the liquid phase and need not be performed at elevated temperatures and pressures, although pressures above atmospheric may be employed if desired. In the second step of the process, the enamine diester is reacted with fluorinated or chlorofluorinated alkyl acid halide, anhydride or mixed anhydride represented by The third step of the process involves the reaction of the 2 alkylcarbonyl 3 amino 2 pentenedicarboxylate produced in step 2 with a fluorinated or chlorofluorinated acetonitrile to form a 4 amino pyridine dicarboxylate compound. Again, as in step 2 of the process, dimethyl or diethyl ethers, toluene, or the like are suitable solvent media and an amine base such as triethylamine, potassium t butoxide or DBU is employed. Temperatures of 60 C to 50 C are generally sufficient for this reaction step. When higher temperatures are to be used, superatmospheric pressures may be required because of the volatility of the halogenated acetonitrils.
