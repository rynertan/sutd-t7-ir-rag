# COMPUTER MEMORY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A computer memory system 10 is provided for use with a user processor 20 , and which provides automatic memory operations independently of the user processor 30 . The memory system 10 includes a logical memory system 10 which is accessed by the user processor 20 through a binding register unit 15 , enabling the user processor 20 to allocate blocks 40, 45 and specify the length of the blocks. Data 40d, 45d within the blocks 40, 45 can also be specified by the user by relative indexing i , j with respect to a block specifier in the binding register unit 15 . The user cannot ac cess the memory 12 directly, but must access the memory 12 through the binding registers 21 30 . The logical memory system 10 is controlled by a separate memory management unit 11 which manages the physical memory 12 of the sys tem 10 which manages the memory 12 to have the logical memory system 10 appearance to the user processor 20 .
