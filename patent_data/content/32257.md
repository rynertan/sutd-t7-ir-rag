# Method for the continuous manufacture of packing containers.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a continuous manufacture of packing containers comprising an outer rigid casing 17 and an inner baglike container 16 , the inner container being manufactured in that first seals 5 are arranged in pairs at equal distances, substantially in transverse direction of the web, whereupon mandrels 2 are introduced into the web which has been provided with seals, and opening devices are applied to the web with the help of the mandrels as backing. After the mandrels have been withdrawn the free edges 32 of the web are sealed to one another and the contents are introduced into the tube formed which is sealed in its trans verse direction along narrow sealing regions 13 to form filled and closed tube portions 14 which are separated from one another and are introduced into a rigid casing 17 .
