# Data signal detection apparatus.

## Abstract
A readout signal detection circuit comprises a data signal detector 12 which senses changes in voltage of the signal waveform relative to signal peak amplitude threshold detec tors 14, 15 for sensing signal peak magnitudes that exceed preset positive and negative magnitude a differentiator 16 to locate signal peak position by sensing changes in slope of the signal waveform and logic circuitry 46, 32, 33, 24, 37, 34 to test the validity of a detected peak in a linear readout signal applied to the detectors 12, 14, 15 and the differentiator 16 in parallel. A ramp timer 36 provides a delay and fixed period during which the readout signal is checked for validity.
