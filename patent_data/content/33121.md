# Photoflash unit having a reflector.

## Abstract
An improved photoflash unit 10 comprising a circuit board 43 with lamp firing circuitry 55 thereon, a plurality e.g. ten of electrically activated photoflash lamps 11 15 and 21 25 and a reflector 40,41 located between the lamps and circuitry. The lamp firing circuitry 55 includes at least one switch which is activated by radiant energy emitted from an adjacent photoflash lamp. The improvement comprises pro viding at least one longitudinal opening slot 83 within a cavity portion 21 , 12 , 14 of the reflector 40, 41 between the activating lamp and switch, and surrounding the opening 83 with a transparent, non conductive region 85 to thereby assure consistent switch activation by substantially eliminat ing arcing between the reflector and circuitry.
