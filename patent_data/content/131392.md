## Description
SECONDARY CELL This inventions relates to secondary cells. In recent years small portable electronic devices powered by electrical cells have become very advanced and are now in widespread use. Such electronic devices are wrist watches, cameras, calculators lighters, hearing aids, etc. Thus efforts have been made to produce electrical cells of relatively small size and of reduced thickness, yet having increased capacity. However, as the number of functions of small portable electronic devices has increased, this has inevitably resulted in an increase in their power consumption. Therefore, the cells of such electronic devices must satisfy requirements which conflict in the effort to reduce their size and thickness. It has therefore been suggested to provide a maintenance free power source by combining a solar cell with a secondary cell. Several types of secondary cell are now in use, such as cadmium nickel cells and zinc silver oxide cells both using aqueous electrolytes, and lithium titanium disulphide cells using nonaqueous electrolytes. Secondary cells must be capable of performing a relatively large number of chargejdischarge cycles, have a relatively good charging efficiency and have a relatively small self discharge rate. These requirements need to be taken into consideration when determining the cathodically active material and the anodically active material of secondary cells. Cathodically active materials should exhibit little or no structural change as a result of the electrochemical oxidizing and reducing reactions which should be reversible, and cathodically active materials should have very low solubility in the electrolyte.Anodically active materials, on the other hand, should not form dendrites during the period of charging, and should not produce gas as a result of side reactions. However, conventional anodically and cathodically active materials in secondary cells cannot fully satisfy all of the above requirements.For example, cadmium nickel cells have a relatively low charging efficiency due to a side reaction which cause oxygen to evolve on the cathode during charging. Lithium titanium disulphide cells suffer from the disadvantage that the titanium disulphide crystals decay with the repetition of the chargejdischarge cycles, since lithium ions infiltrate into the titanium disulphide crystals during charging, so that the crystals extend in the direction of the C axis. According to the present invention, there is provided a secondary cell comprising an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte in contact with both the anode and the cathode, characterised by said cathode containing as an electrochemically active material an oxidation product of a polynuclear metal cyanide complex of the general formula NA B CN 6 t XH20 where 0 a metal ion having a valence of A, N a metal ion having a valence of B, K a positive number of from I to 4, Q a positive number of from 1 to 3, x a positive number inclusive of 0 and wherein A, B, K and Q satisfy the following relation A x K 6 B x and, said anode contains as an electrochemically active material a reduction product of the said polynuclear metal cyanide complex. The polynuclear metal cyanide complex may be represented by the formula NA4A NB CN 6 3.SH20 where MA Fe III , Ru III , Os III , Al III , Sb III , Bi III , Ce III NB Fe II , Fu II , Ox I , x a positive number inclusive of O, Alternatively, the polynuclear metal cyanide complex may be represented by the formula M3A MB CN6 2.xH20 where MA Mn II , Fe II , Ru II 1 Os 11 , Co 11 , Ni II , Cu II , Zn II , Cd II , Sn II , Pb II , Bg II , Pd II , Rh II , Th II , Ti 11 , MB Cr III , Nn III , Fe III , Co III , Rh III , Ir III , x a positive number inclusive of 0. As a further possibility the polynuclear metal cyanide complex may be represented by the formula MAjMB CN 6 . 2 MA M Sn IV , Ce IV , MB Cr II , Mn II , Fe II , Ru II , Os II , Co II , Ph II , Ir 11 1 x a positive number inclusive of 0. The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure I shows cyclic voltammograms of oxidation reduction reaction of Prussian Blue formed by two different methods and Figure 2 shows a single electrode constant current charge discharge characteristics of Prussian Blue and Everitt s salt and constant current chargejdischarge characteristics of Everitt s salt and Berlin Green. when discussing Prussian Blue and Prussian Blue analogs it is most convenient to start with Prussian Blue itself because it has been well studied in the past. An understanding of PrussianBlue analog follows easily from an understanding of Prussian Blue itself. Prussian Blue is a compound which was first synthesized in 1704 by Diesbach, a dye craftsman, in Berlin. Since then, because of its deep blue colour, Prussian Blue has been widely used as a pigment for printing inks, paints, etc. and has other colouring uses. Prussian blue has some interesting properties in addition to being the first metal complex to be synthesized. Prussian Blue is believed to include two types of compounds, i.e. soluble Prussian Blue NIFe III Fe II CN 6 and insolublePrussian Blue Fe III 43 wherein MI represents a monovalent cation. One of the interesting properties of PrussianBlue is that whichever type it is, Fe II and Fe III , which have different oxidation numbers, coexist in a common crystal lattice.Prussian Blue is thus a typical mixed valence complex compound.A second interesting property is that whichever type it is, PrussianBlue is an insoluble salt having a solubility product Ksp 10 40A third interesting property of Prussian Blue is that Everitt s salt which is the reduction product of Prussian Blue represented by N2IFe II or N4IFe II 4 Fe II CN 6 3 and BerlinGreen which is the oxidation product of Prussian Blue represented by Fe III or Fe III 4 Fe III CN 6 3.3X , whereX represents a monovalent anion, both have the same lattice constant of 10.2 i as Prussian Blue see, for example, J.F. Keggin andF.D. Miles, Nature, 137, 577 1936 . This means that the crystalline structure of Prussian Blue is not changed when it undergoes oxidation reduction reactions. These interesting properties of Prussian Blue are also found in Prussian Blue analogs. For example, a compound having Ru II substituted for Fe 11 bonded to the carbon atoms of the cyano groups of Prussian Blue is also a mixed valence complex compound and is a purple pigment known as Ruthenium purple. Ruthenium purple has a lattice constant of 10.4 i see, for example J.F.. Keggin and F.D. Miles, Nature 137, 577 1936 . It is also known that 3 bonds with Nn2 , Fe2 , Co2 , Ni2 , cd2 , to form very low solubility salts represented by N3II Cr CN 6 2, and which has the same salt structure as Prussian Blue and a lattice constant a 10. 1 to 10.6 . Similarly, M III CN 6 3 whereM Nn3 , Co3 , Rh3 or Ir3 forms Prussian Blue analogs see, for example, B.M. Chadwick and A.G. Sharpe, Advan. Inorg. Chem.Radiochem. 8, 83 1966 . Generally Prussian Blue analogs may may be represented by the general formula MKA MB CN XE2 K wherein MA a metal ion having a valence of A, MB a metal ion having a valence of B, K a positive number from 1 to 4, a positive number from 1 to 3, x a positive number including 0. The foregoing shows that Prussian Blue and its analogs are salts with very low solubility having a common structure. Prussian Blue and its analogs are electrochemically active compounds capable of undergoing a reversible oxidation reduction reaction. Although Prussian Blue and its analogs are mixed valence complex compounds having a metal ion as a redox centre, their electrochemical behaviour is not well known at present. This is because Prussian Blue and its analogs have been traditionally available only in the form of colloidal particles. Prussian Blue is conventionally prepared by the following methods a Fe2 Prussian Blue b Fe Fe II CN 6 Prussian Blue c Fe2 Fe II CN 634 Everitt s salt oxidation Prussian BluePrussian Blue is obtained only in the form of colloidal particles since the chemical reaction takes place very rapidly according to any one of methods a , b and c .Up until now it was impossible to obtain Prussian Blue in the form of a film which could be conveniently used as an electrode to examine the electrochemical behaviour of Prussian Blue. Prussian Blue and its analogs can now be obtained in the form of a film on an electrode having a suitable shape to examine the electrochemical behaviour thereof by one of the following methods 1 Prussian Blue or a Prussian Blue analog is electrolytically produced in the form of a film on an electrically conductive substrate to obtain a thin film electrode. 2 A composite thin film electrode is obtained by bindingPrussian Blue or a Prussian Blue analog with a matrix polymer together with an electrically conductive agent such as acetylene black. Nethods 1 and 2 are briefly explained hereinafter and the electrochemical behaviour of Prussian Blue as a typical example will be discussed. First, method 1 is not only important in that a film ofPrussian Blue can be produced, but is also important from the standpoint of evaluating whether method 2 is appropriate or not. Method 1 is based on the experimental finding that, unlike conventional methods a , b , c of synthesising Prussian Blue, no deposit forms in a mixed solution containing Be and IFe CN A very small platinum plate electrode on which a film of PrussianBlue is to be formed and a large platinum plate electrode to be used as a counter electrode, were immersed in a solution containing 3 Fe and lFe cN 6l ions. Constant current electrolysis was then carried out for about 10 minutes by cathodically polarising 2 the small platinum electrode at a current density of about 10 WA cm2. At the end of electrolysis, it was found that a film of PrussianBlue had been deposited as a blue film on the small platinum electrode. In order to examine its electrochemical behaviour, the thus obtained film of Prussian Blue was placed in 1 N KCl to provide a three electrode electrolytic cell. A cyclic voltammogram of the film of Prussian Blue was produced by sweeping a triangular waveform potential thereon. The result is as shown by curve 1 in Figure 1. When the potential with respect to a saturated calomel electrode SCE is 0.6 V, the film is Prussian Blue.As the potential is swept from 0.6 V, toward the cathode potential, a reduction current peak appears at about 0.2 V and the film changes to a film of Everitt s salt at 0.2 V. As the potential is swept from 0.2 V toward the anode potential, an oxidation current peak appears at about 0.2 V and the film changes to a film of Prussian Blue at 0.6 V. The above process may be expressed by the following electrochemical reaction scheme EMI7.1 Prussian Blue Everitt s salt Next, as the potential of the electrode is swept from 0.6 V towards the anode potential, an oxidation peak current appears at about 0.9 V, and the film becomes Berlin Green which is an oxidation product at about 1.4 V. As the potential is swept from 1.4 V to the cathodepotential, a reduction peak current from Berlin Green to Prussian Blue appears at about 0.9 V, and the film becomes Prussian Blue at 0.6 V. The above process is expressed by the following electrochemical reaction scheme Fe III 4 Fe II CN 6 3 3e 3CI Fe lII 4 Fe 111 4 Fe III CN 6 3.3CI Prussian blue Berlin green Next, method 2 will be described.An aqueous solution Fe 2 containing Fe ions was mixed with an aqueous solution containing Fe CN 6 3 ions, giving Prussian Blue in the form of a colloidal deposit. The Prussian Blue deposit was then thoroughly dried in vacuo and micronised to a fine powder having a particle size of not larger than 1 m by means of a mixer mill In a solution of toluene and 1 by weight of a low density polyetbylene were dispersed 100 mg of the fine Prussian Blue powder and 100 mg of acetylene black.The dispersion thus obtained was spread on a very small platinum plate electrode by a spin coating method, and the toluene, acting as a solvent, was removed by evaporation in a dryer to obtain a composite electrode consisting of PrussianBlue, acetylene black, and lowdensity polyethylene. In order to examine the electrochemical properties of this composite electrode, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in 1 M KCl. The result is shown by a curve 2 in Figure 1. Like the method the electrochemical behaviour of Prussian Blue can be studied. It was thus determined that by using either the electrolytic film forming method 1 or the composite film forming method 2 ,Prussian Blue can be used not only as a pigment but also as anodically and cathodically active materials for secondary cells, since it undergoes a reversible electrochemical reaction. That is, Everitt s salt ES which is a reduction product of Prussian Blue PB serves as an anodically active material for a secondary cell according to the present invention which exhibits good reversible property, and Berlin Green BG which is an oxidation product of Prussian Blue serves as a cathodically active material for a secondary cell according to the present invention which exhibits good reversible properties. It was also found that Prussian Blue analogs are also effective as anodically and cathodically active materials for secondary cells. The following examples are given to demonstrate that oxidation and reduction products of Prussian Blue and Prussian Blue analogs are useful as cathodically active materials and anodically active materials for secondary cells. Example 1 This example is given to illustrate single electrode constantcurrent chargejdischarge characteristics of Prussian Blue andEveritt s salt. A small platinum plate having an area of about 2 2 1 cm and a large platinum plate having an area of 50 cm were immersed in an aqueous solution containing potassium ferricyanide K3F6 cN 6 at a concentration of 20 mM and ferric chloride FeCR3 at a concentration of 20 mM, and having a pH of 1.0. Electrolysis was carried out at a current density of 10 gA for 10 minutes with the small platinum plate as the anode. A film of Prussian Blue was found to have been deposited on the small platinum plate. The electrode so formed, a platinum electrode having an area 2 of 10 Cm , and a saturated calomel electrode SCE as a reference electrode, were immersed in an aqueous solution containing potassium sulphate K2504 at a concentration of 0.5 M, to constitute an electrolytic cell of the three electrode type. The single electrode constant current chargejdischarge characteristics of the electrode wit a film of Prussian Blue were examined by means of this electro lytic cell. Curve 1 of Figure 2 represents chargejdiscbarge 2 characteristics at a current density of 10 gA cm .Current efficiencies of charge and discharge were 100 and 98 , respectively, and current efficiencies were nearly the same even after 103 charge discharge cycles. Example 2 This example deals with chargeidischarge characteristics of a secondary cell according to the present invention in which a reduction product of Prussian Blue, i.e. Everitt s salt was used as the anodically active material, and an oxidation product of Prussian Blue, i.e., Berlin Green was used as the cathodically active material. A film of Prussian Blue was precipitated onto a platinum 2 plate having an area of 1 cm in the same manner as that of Example 1. A first electrode obtained by effecting electrolysis at a current density of 10 WA for 10 minutes, was then subjected to electrolysis for 15 minutes to form a second electrode. A secondary cell was constituted by using the first and second electrodes. An aqueous solution having a pli of 4.0 and containing potassium sulphate at a concentration of 0.5 M, was used as an electrolyte. Curve 2 of Figure 2 represents constantcurrent chargejdischarge characteristics at a current density of 10 WA cmê. During charging the first electrode acts as a cathode andthe second electrode acts as an anode. These roles are reversed during discharge. From the chargejdischarge characteristics, the charge discharge efficiency was found to be about 90 maintaining an average terminal voltage of 0.8 V. The terminal voltage and charge discharge efficiency were found to be nearly the seme even after 10 charge discharge cycles. The electrochemical reaction of the secondary cell for each of the electrodes are thoughttobe as follows First Electrode chargeEMI10.1 dischargePrussian Blue Everitt s salt Second Electrode charge Fe III 4 Fe II CN 6 3 43 2 SO42 Be Fe III 4 3 26 504 discharge Prussian blue Berlin green In this example, it will be seen that the reduction product Everitt s salt of Prussian Blue serves as the anodically active material for the secondary cell, and the oxidation product thereof Berlin Green serves as a cathodically active material for the secondary cell. That is, there is achieved a thin film secondary cell which employs the same compound, but having differently oxidized states, for the anode and the cathode. Example 3 A first electrode having a film thickness of 3000 and a second electrode having a film thickness of 4000 were formed 2 on a platinum plate having an area of about 1 cm by method 2 above. The chargeydischarge characteristics were examined in the same manner as in Example 2. The charge discharge efficiency was found to be about 80 maintaining an average terminal voltage of about 0.8 V. The terminal voltage and charge discharge efficiency were found to be nearly the same even after 103 charge discharge cycles. Example 4 This Example illustrates a thin film secondary cell according to the present invention which employs a reduction product and an oxidation product of Fe III 4 s II CN 6J 3Xfl20 as the anodi cally active material and the cathodically active material, respectively. First, K4 Os CN 6 synthesized according to a customary manner was oxidised with PbO2 which is an insoluble oxidizing agent, in an acidic aqueous solution containing sulphuric acid, such solution contained tos III cN 6 ions. An aqueous solution 6 containing 20 mM of jOs III CN E ions was admixed with the same amount of an aqueous solution having a pB of 1.0 containing ferric chloride FecQ3 at the same concentration to form a clear solution of pale yellowish colour.A large platinum plate having 2 an area of about 50 cm to be used as a cathode and a small platinum 2 plate having an area of 1 cm were immersed in this solution, and constant current electrolysis was performed at a current of 5 WA for 15 mintues with the small platinum plate as the anode.A purple film was precipitated on the anode to form a first electrode.The electrolysis was performed for 20 minutes to precipitate a 2 purple film on a further plating plate having an area of 1 cin to form a second electrode. Then, a secondary cell was constituted by using the first and second electrodes and the constant current charge discharge characteristics were determined in the same manner as in Example 2. The first electrode was used as the cathode and the second electrode was used as the anode during charging and vise versa during discharging. After 103 charge discharge cycles, the charge discharge efficiency was about 80 maintaining an average terminal voltage of abut 0.8 V. Example 5 This example illustrates a thin film secondary cell which employs a reduction product and an oxidation product ofFe II 3 Mn III CN 612.xH20 as an anodically active material and a cathodically active material, respectively. An aqueous solution containing X3tMn III CN 6 and an aqueous solution containing FeC were mixed together at an equal molar ratio to obtain a precipitate of Fe II 3tMn II1 CN 60 2.xE20. By method 2 above, a composite film electrode was obtained by forming Fe II 3 Mn 111 632 acetylene black low density polyethylene on the platinum plate. A secondary cell was constituted by using two composite film electrodes thus produced. Constantcurrent charge discharge characteristics were determined in the same manner as in Example 2. The charge discharge efficiency was about 70 maintaining an average terminal voltage of about 0.9 V after 100 chargedischarge cycles. Example 6 This Example illustrates a thin film secondary cell employing a reduction product and an oxidation product of Sn IV Fe iI CN 63 xH20 as an anodically active material and a cathodically active material, respectively. An aqueous solution containing K4tFe lI cN 6 and SN IV Cl4 dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid were mixed together at an equal molar ratio to obtain a white precipitate of SN IV Fe II CN 6 .xH20. Relying upon method 2 above, a composite film electrode was obtained by formingSn IV Fe II CN 6 acetylene black lowdensity polyethylene on a platinum plate. A secondary cell was constituted by using two composite electrodes thus produced. Constantllurrent charge discharge characteristics were determined in the same manner as in Example 2. The charge discharge efficiency was about 70 maintaining an average terminal voltage of about 0.8 V after 100 chargeydischarge cycles.
