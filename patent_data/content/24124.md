# Ferritic stainless steel and process for producing it.

## Abstract
Careful control of chemistry, and in particular niobium, and of annealing temperatures provides a ferritic stainless steel of improved creep strength. Annealing is performed at a temperature of at least 1038 C 1900 F , and in certain embod iments, at a temperature no higher than 1088 C 1990 F . The steel comprises, by weight, up to 0.1 carbon, up to 0.05 nitrogen, from 11 to 20 chromium, up to 5 aluminum, up to 5 molybdenum, up to 1.5 manganese, up to 1.5 sili con, up to 0.5 nickel, up to 0.5 copper, up to 0.6 titanium, and niobium and tantalum in accordance with the following a 0.63 to 1.15 effective niobium, in the absence of tantalum, or b effective niobium and tantalum in accordance with the equation When both niobium and tantalum are present, balance essentially iron said effective niobium and tantalum being computed in accordance with the following If A is positive or zero Then Effective Nb content weight Nb Effective Ta content weight Ta If A is negative Then When Ta is absent Then if B is positive Effective Nb content B Effective Ta content weight Ta If B is negative Effective Nb content 0
