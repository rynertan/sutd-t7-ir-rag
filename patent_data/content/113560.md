# Capillary bridge viscometer.

## Abstract
A capillary bridge viscometer is disclosed for measuring the relative viscosity of a solute in a solvent. The bridge contains two fluid flow circuits 8, 9 . One circuit 8 contains two capillaries 12, 14 in series. The second circuit 9 contains two capillaries 11, 13 in series with valving means 15 and an associated liquid reservoir 18 positioned intermediate of the capillaries 11, 13 . A common feed line 6 feeds a first liquid to both fluid flow circuits 8, 9 . With the valving means 15 set in one operating position, the first liquid flows through all four capillaries 11, 12, 13, 14 and no pressure differential is established across the bridge. With the valving means 15 set in a second operating position, the first liquid exiting the first capillary 11 of the second fluid flow circuit 9 flows into the liquid reservoir 18 and displaces a second liquid stored therein which then flows through the second capillary 13 of the second fluid flow circuit 9 . A differential pressure is established across the bridge which is a function of the viscosity of the second liquid. The pressure differential is measured by a differential pressure transducer 22 .
