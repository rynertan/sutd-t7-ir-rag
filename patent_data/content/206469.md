# Method and apparatus for establishing and utilising anaerobic conditions.

## Abstract
An anaerobic station and a method of establishing and utilising anaerobic conditions in such a station is described. In order to provide a more efficient and economic use of the gases required for anaerobic conditions, the anaerobic station is divided into two chambers a first chamber 12 with an anaerobically maintained atmosphere, which cham ber can afford compact storage for specimens being cul tured, and a low oxygen second chamber 14 serving as a manipulation chamber with an otherwise inert gas atmo sphere maintained therein. A selective communication 16 is provided between the first and second chambers. The chamber 14 is provided with a further selective communication 38 to an entry exit lock 40 which is sub jected, when used for access from outside, to inert gas flushing, from the chamber 14 . The lock 40 is provided with a displaceable extraction fan 44 to reduce pressure in the lock prior to opening the further selective communica tion 38 . The pressure in the two chambers is preferably above atmospheric with the pressure in the chamber 12 higher than that in the chamber 14 .

## Description
title Method and apparatus for establishing and utilising anaerobic conditions DESCRIPPION Uhe invention relates to a method and apparatus for establishing and utilising anaerobic conditions, typically in relation to requirements for chambers used for culturing micro organisms requiring absence of oxygen, in order to grow. Such requirements arise in microbiology, e.g. pathology, laboratories in the process of aiding identification of certain types of bacteria including disease producing bacteria. Conventionally, a typical anaerobic atmosphere comprises a mixture of oxygen consuming gas hydrogen , an anerobe nurture gas carbon dioxide and an inert gas nitrogen , typically in ratios by volume of 1 1 8, respectively.At least in relatively advanced countries, such anaerobic gas mixture is available as such, i.e. already admixed cylinders, but is not cheap and there is advantage to be gained from increased efficiency in its use. It is, in fact, the case that we have already made proposals in ourEuropean patent application no. 0168915 for economy by using separate supplies of those constituent gases effectively with injection of oxygen consuming gas only after flushing without that gas. It is an object of this invention to make yet further economy whether, as will be specifically described below, by using pre mixed anaerobic gas, or by using separate supplies of constituent gases. To that end, we have devised a radical departure from customary anaerobic chamber design hitherto.Such design has generally been for a relatively large main chamber having an incubated anaerobic atmosphere that is used for specimen culturing with time and for manipulation including opening, inoculation and examination, conveniently using hands on facilities by way of gloved ports, and for a much smaller lock chamber via which materials are entered and removed, the lock chamber and the main chamber having an interconnecting part that can be opened and closed via the hands on facilityCustomarily, the lock chamber is flushed and purged with anaerobic gas mixture at each opening to the outside, or can be so according to our above mentioned patent application. According to this invention an anaerobic station comprises a first chamber with an anaerobically maintained atmosphere, which chamber can afford compact storage for specimens being cultured and which may be heated a low oxygen second chamber with an otherwise inert gas atmosphere maintained therein and serving for manipulation purposes and selective coinitninication between those chambers for culturing and manipulation, respectively. It is convenient for both of the first and second chambers to have hands on facilities via gloved ports. By manipulation purposes we mean operations including for example loading unloading of the first chamber and the inspection of specimens etc. It is convenient to refer to the first and second chambers respectively as culturing and manipulation chambers. According to another aspect of the invention then there is provided a method of establishing and utilising anaerobic conditions in an anaerobic station, the method comprising maintaining a substantially anaerobic atmosphere in a first chamber serving as a storage and culturing chamber, and maintaining a low oxygen otherwise inert gas atmosphere in a second chamber having selective communication with the first chamber, so that loading, unloading inspection and manipulation is done via or in the second chamber. It is preferred for the manipulation chamber to have further selective communication to an entry exit lock that is subjected, when used for access from outside, to inert gas flushing, advantageously from the manipulation chamber, i.e. with the aforesaid further selective communication open. A suitable flushed lock comprises an external tubular extension from that further selective communication that may have a displaceable extraction fan at its otherwise free end. In operation of the flushed lock, it can be loaded with sealed specimens, say by temporary, displacement of the extraction fan, before opening the further selective communication, Prior to opening thereof a reduced pressure can be pulled on that lock, say from action of the aforesaid extraction fan. Then, at opening the further selective communication, the lowoxygen inert gas atmosphere of the manipulation chamber will flood into and flush through the lock, conveniently as drawn by said extraction fan, and is fed to the manipulation chamber at over pressure from compressed source. After transfer of the specimens into the manipulation chamber, using the hands on facility thereof, the further selective communicatIon is closed and the extraction fan turned off. It will be appreciated that opening and inoculation of those specimens in the low oxygen predominantly inert gas atmosphere of the manipulation chamber can be done quickly for transfer into the culturing chamber without deleterious effect as the anaerobic atmosphere of the latter can be assured to have sufficient oxygen burning gas component to kill off any oxygen entrant thereto. Similar considerations apply to inspection in the manipulation chamber of specimens taken from the culturing chamber, though at least one specimen at a time can usually be first inspected therein, i.e. before transfer of batches to the manipulation chamber. Specific implementation of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic elevational view of an anaerobic station Figure 2 is a corresponding schematic end view. In the drawing, anaerobic station 10 comprises a culturing chamber 12, and a manipulation chamber 14 with a selective communication 16 therebetween of the well known port with removable sealing bung type. The culturing chamber 12 is shown equipped with hands on facility via front ports 18A, 18B for long gauntlets sealed thereto. Internally, the culturing chamber 12 is shown equipped with carousels or shelves for compact storage of petri dish stacks therein.Also indicated is a dehumidifying condenser plate 20 at its end wall 12A, and which is preferably of aircooled type with drip gutter 20G and U type tube drain 20U providing a water trap . An external cooler blind 22 is indicated for progressively adjustable insulation of the plate 20 from the effects of external lower temperatures. Heating is conveniently by way of electric lamps not shown also serving lighting purposes and preferably run off a lower voltage supply than normally intended. A conventional capillary thermostat not shown may be used in temperature control. Supply of anaerobic gas mixture is indicated from pressurised cylinder 24 via a solenoid valve 26 and pressure regulator 28 controlling the valve via an associated switch not shown operable to maintain a desired over pressure, for which 1 2 inches 25 50 mm of water gauge has been found to be satisfactory. Also, the culturing chamber 12 will usually have a circulation fan not shown for its anaerobic atmosphere, and a catalyst for oxygen consuming action at a convenient place in that circulation. The manipulation chamber 14 is also shown equipped with a hands on facility via front ports 30A, 30B also for long gauntlets sealed thereto. A nitrogen supply thereto is indicated via pressurised cylinder 32, a solenoid valve 34 and another pressure regulator 36 with associated valve control switch operable to maintain a suitable over pressure in the manipulation chamber 14, but further preferably less than the over pressure for the culturing chamber 12 and typically i 1 inch 12.525 mm water gauge. Thus, the manipulation chamber has a low oxygen, predominently inert gas nitrogen atmosphere. At the other end 14A of the manipulation chamber is a further selective communication 38, again conveniently of the port with removable sealing bung type, this time to a small lock 40 shown as a tubular extension away from the end 14A. The lock 40 has an inverted U section and is shown with capacity for three stacks of petri dishes. Its free end 40A is shown closed off by a plate 42 carrying an extraction fan 44 with normally closed louvres 44D and hinged to the lock 40 at 46. Controls can be located in an instrument panel 50 conveniently located above the manipulation chamber 14.The manipulation chamber 14 serves for inoculation and emanation of cultures. In operation of the flushed lock 40, it can be loaded with sealed specimens by temporary displacement of the extraction fan 44 before opening the further selective communication 38. Prior to opening of the latter, a reduced pressure is pulled on the lock 40 by the action of the aforesaid extraction fan 44. Then at opening of the further selective communication 38, the low oxygen inert gas atmosphere of the manipulation chamber 14 floods into and flushes through the lock 40. The fan 44 aids this flushing. The specimens can then be transferred into the manipulation chamber 14 using the hands on facility thereof, whereafter the further selective communication is closed and the extraction fan turned off. Opening and inoculation of the specimens in the low oxygen predominantly inert gas atmosphere of the manipulation chamber 14 can be done quickly for transfer into the culturing chamber 12. It will be apparent that the apparatus described can accomplish the procedures mentioned above, including control on a suitable basis, and the use of anaerobic gas mixture in the culture chamber 12 is minimal.Moreover, the nitrogen for the manipulation chamber 14 and flushing purposes can be inexpensive commercial grades, typically using about 30 litres only for each lock flushing.
