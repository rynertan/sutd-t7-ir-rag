## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DL SERINE This invention relates to a process for producing serine. Serine is a kind of an a amino acid. L serine is used as a component of a parenteral solution, and D serire is useful as a material for cycloserine, an antibiotic.Serine is also useful as a material for the production by an enzymatic process of L tryptophan which is expected to gain future acceptance as a feed additive. One conventional process for production of DLserine from aziridine 2 carboxylic acid comprises heating in 15 sulfuric acid lithium aziridine 2 carboxylate synthesized by hydrolysis of ethyl aziridine 2 carboxylate in the presence of lithium hydroxide K.D.Gundermann, Chem. Ber., 93, 1639 1960 . This process, however, requires the use of a large excess about 12 moles of sulfuric acid relative to the starting lithium aziridine 2 carboxylate. In order to separate the resulting serine from the reaction mixture after the reaction, the excess sulfuric acid should be neutralized with calcium hydroxide or barium hydroxide to precipitate it as calcium sulfate or barium sulfate, followed by separating the salt by filtration. The process steps, therefore, become complex and the reactor volume is large.If an anion having higher nucleophilic reactivity than water, such as a halogen ion, is present in the hydrolysis of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid in sulfuric acid, a compound having such an ion added thereto forms as a byproduct to decrease the yield of DL serine. It is desirable therefore to provide a process for producing DL serine from aziridine 2 carboxylic acid or its alkali or alkaline earth metal salt which can be produced relatively easily. The salt of aziridine 2 carboxylate can be easily obtained by heating an aqueous solution of an a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt, which can be easily produced by the reaction of an a,ss dihalogeno propionitrile or an a halogenoacrylonitrile with ammonia, together with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. The present inventors have made extensive investigations, and found that DL serine can be produced with industrial advantage by causing aziridine 2carboxylic acid to be adsorbed to a strong acid type cation exchange resin, and heating the ion exchange resin in the wet state, and that DL serine can be industrially produced by treating an a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt in water or a water containing organic solvent with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide to form an aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salt, charging the reaction mixture onto a strong acid type cation exchange resin without isolating the product therefrom, thereby to adsorb aziridine 2 carboxylic acid, washing the resin with water to remove a halogen ion, and heating the ion exchange resin. The process of this invention is a novel process not known heretofore, and has the advantage that, in contrast to the conventional hydrolyzing method in sulfuric acid, the process can be markedly simplified and serine can be obtained in a high yield based on the aziridine 2carboxylic acid without substantially forming a byproduct. Another advantage of the process of this invention is that serine formed by the reaction can be simply isolated by washing the heated ion exchange resin with aqueous ammonia to elute the serine, and concentratirg the eluate to dryness or concentrating and crystallizing it. When according to one embodiment of the process of this invention the process starts from the production of an a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt, halogen ioris formed as a by product in the production of an aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salt can be easily removed. Hence, this brings about the advantage that serine can be obtained in a high yield based on the starting a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt without substantial formation of by products. The aziridine 2 carboxylic acid or its alkali or alkaline earth metal salt to be adsorbed to a strong acid type cation exchange resin can be produced by a known method which comprises treating an alkyl aziridine 2carboxylate obtained by reaction between an alkyl a,B dibromopropionate and liquid ammonia, with an alkali or alkaline earth metal K.D.Gundermann, Chem. Ber., 93, 1639 1960, E.Kyburz, Helv. Chim. Acta., 49, 368 1966 or a similar method. The aziridine 2 carboxylate salt produced by such a known method needs not to be isolated before being put to use in the process of this invention, and it may be used in the form of an aqueous solution obtained after the hydrolysis of the alkyl aziridine 2carboxylate.Such an aqueous solution may, for example, be an aqueous solution of sodium aziridine 2 carboxylate obtained by hydrolyzing isopropyl aziridine 2 carboxylate obtained from isopropyl a,B dibromopropionate and liquid ammonia with sodium hydroxide in a mixture of ethanol and water and distilling off the alcohol under reduced pressure, or an aqueous solution of a salt of aziridine 2carboxylic acid with another alkali or alkaline earth metal which is obtained by a similar method. The aziridine 2 carboxylic acid or its alkali or alkaline earth metal salt to be adsorbed to the strong acid type cation exchange resin in the process of this invention may also be produced by a novel method discovered by the present inventors which comprises treating an a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide in water or a water containing organic solvent. Examples of the a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid used in this method include a chloro ss aminopropionitrile, a bromo ss aminopropionitrile, a chloro 8 aminopropionitrile hydrochloride, a bromo Baminopropionitrile hydrochloride, a chloro B aminopropionitrile sulfate and a bromo 8 aminopropionitrile sulfate. These a halogeno B aminopropionitriles or their mineral acid salts can be produced in the following manner.A free a halogeno B aminopropionitrile is obtained by reacting an a,8 dihalogenopropionitrile or a halogenoacrylonitrile with ammonia in water or an organic solvent, optionally extracting the reaction product with a water immiscible organic solvent, and distilling the reaction product under reduced pressure.Action of hydrogen chloride or sulfuric acid on the reaction product mixture or the extract gives an a halogeno B aminopropionitrile hydrochloride or sulfate.For example, an chloro B aminopropionitrile hydrochloride can be isolated in a yield of more than 80 by adding a chloroacrylonitrile dropwise at about 0 C to a solution of ammonia gas in isopropanol, reacting them at this temperature for 2 to 4 hours, and then feeding a solution of hydrogen chloride in isopropanol into the reaction mixture. The alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide used in this method is a hydroxide of an alkali metal such as lithium, sodium, potassium and rubidium, or a hydroxide of an alkaline earth metal such as beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. Specific examples are lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, beryllium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide. The amount of the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is at least 2 equivalents based on the starting material when the starting material is a free a halogeno B aminopropionitrile, and at least 3 equivalents based on the starting material when the starting material is an a halogeno B aminopropionitrile mineral acid salt. There is no specific upper limit to the amount of the hydroxide used, but it is not necessary to use it in great excess.Usually, up to 5 equivalents are sufficient. The reaction is carried out in water or a watercontaining organic solvent. In other words, the reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution or in a solution of a mixture of water and a water miscible organic solvent.Examples of the water miscible organic solvent include methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, tert butanol,Cellosolve or methyl Cellosolve, acetone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N,N dimethyl formamide, N,N diethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. When a mixture of water and an organic solvent is used, the ratio of water to the organic solvent may be chosen as desired. The amount of the solvent used is 3 to 200 times, preferably 5 to 100 times, the amount of the starting a halogeno Baminopropionitrile. The reaction is carried out by dissolving the a halogeno B aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt in water, while stirring the solution adding the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide in the form of an aqueous solution or as a solid, and continuing the stirring at 0 to 100 C for 0.5 to 50 hours, preferably at 20 to 80 C for 1 to 30 hours. The order of addition of the starting material and the alkali is not specially limited to the above mentioned order. For example, the a halogeno ss aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt may be added to an aqueous solution or a suspension of the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. The end point of the reaction may be determined by thin layer chromatography, etc. In practising the process of this invention, an aqueous solution of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid or an aqueous solution containing its alkali or alkaline earth metal salt for example, an aqueous solution containing an alkali or alkaline earth metal aziridine 2 carboxylate obtained by treating an a halogeno ss aminopropionitrile with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is charged onto a strong acid type cation exchange resin, and deionized water is then passed through the resin to adsorb aziridine 2 carboxylic acid to the ion exchange resin. The aqueous solution of the aziridine 2carboxylic acid or its metal salt may contain a watermiscible organic solvent such as methanol and ethanol. The halogen ion of a metal halide formed as a by product in the formation of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid from the a halogeno B aminopropionitrile is removed preferably by passing deionized water. When the halogen ion remains, the yield of DL serine tends to decrease.Subsequently, the ion exchange resin having adsorbed thereto aziridine 2 carboxylic acid is heated in the wet state to form DL serine in the adsorbed state. The strong acid type cation exchange resin may be of any form such as H, Na or NH4. Preferably it is in H form. Any kind of ion exchange resins s as a gel, porous or macroporous type can be used. The type of the resin is not limited so long as it is a strong acid type cation exchange resin. Two or more different types of strong acid type cation exchange resins may be used in combination. The amount of the ion exchange resin used is at least 1 equivalent, preferably at least 1.2 equivalents, as an ion exchange capacity in the wet state based on the total amount of the aziridine 2 carboxylic acid and the alkali or alkaline earth metal ion present in the aqueous solution.For example, when 1 mole of sodium aziridine 2 carboxylate is used as a starting material and a strong acid type cation exchange resin having a total exchange capacity of 2.0 meq. ml is used, the amount of the resin used is at least 1 litre, preferably at least 1.2 litres. When aziridine 2carboxylic acid is produced by treating 1 mole of a chloro B aminbpropionitrile hydrochloride in water with 3 moles of sodium hydroxide, and a strong acid type cation exchange resin having a total exchange capacity of 2.2 meq. ml is used, the amount of the resin is at least 2.3 litres, preferably at least 2.7 litres. If the amount of the resin used is smaller than the specified limit, aziridine 3 carboxylic acid may leak out at the time of adsorption.The amount of the ion exchange resin used may be decreased by using an aqueous solution obtained by concentrating the reaction mixture containing the aziridine 2 carboxylate salt and removing the precipitated metal halide by filtration. Adsorption of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid to the strong acid type cation exchange resin in the process of this invention may be performed usually by passing an aqueous solution of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid through a column packed with the ion exchange resin, or adding dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, etc. to the aqueous solution and thus passing the aqueous solution in a neutral or weakly acidic condition and thereafter passing deionized water through the column. The concentration of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid in the aqueous solution of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid is not particularly limited, but preferably it is up to 15 by weight. When the aziridine 2 carboxylic acid produced from an a halogeno 8 aminopropionitrile or its mineral acid salt is used, it may be caused to be adsorbed to the strong acid type cation exchange resin in the same way as above. When a water miscible organic solvent is used in the reaction, the solution to be adsorbed to the cation exchange resin may contain the organic solvent used, but preferably it is distilled off prior to adsorption.After passing the aqueous solution of aziridine 2carboxylic acid through the ion exchange resin, the resin column is washed with water until no halogen ion is detected from the washing. When a halogen ion is present in the ion exchange resin column having adsorbed thereto aziridine 2 carboxylic acid, an a halogeno a alanine orB halogenoalanine is formed as a by product in the subsequent heating of the ion exchange resin, and the yield of the desired serine decreases. According to the process of this invention, the strong acid type cation exchange resin having adsorbed thereto aziridine 2 carboxylic acid and beiny free from a halogen ion is heated in the wet state, namely in the presence of water. There is no specific limitation on the method of heating the ion exchange resin. For example, heated water may be continuously passed through the ion exchange resin column, or the column packed with the ion exchange resin may be heated externallyAlternatively, the ion exchange resin is transferred to a separate heating vessel and heated with stirring. The heating is effected at 40 to 1200C for 1 to 100 hours, preferably at 50 to 100 C for 2 to 50 hours. The reaction proceeds at a temperature of not more than 40 C, for example at room temperature, but a very long period of time is required for completion of the reaction. DL serine formed by heating the ion exchange resin having adsorbed thereto aziridine 2 carboxylic acid exists in the adsorbed state. To isolate serine, it is eluted from the ion exchange resin, for example by using aqueous ammonia, and the eluate is concentrated to dryness. Or the eluate is concentrated to a concentration above the solubility of serine, and then serine is crystallized. The following examples illustrate the present invention.Referential Example 1 Synthesis of lithium aziridine 2 carboxylate 100 g of ethyl a chloro ss aminopropionate was dissolved in 1 litre of dehydrated ethanol, and 200 g of triethanolamine was added.
