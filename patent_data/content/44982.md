# Tube plug.

## Abstract
A tube plug comprises a shell 12 having a tapered inner surface 16 against which an externally tapered expander member 14 moves by application of a pulling force. The expander member 14 is captured in the shell 12 such that motion relative to the shell 12 causes the shell 12 to expand into contact with a heat exchange tube 40 thereby plugging the tube 40 . The expander member 14 is pulled outward to cause expansion of the shell 12 . For removal the shell is pulled and thereby elongated and reduced in thickness.

## Description
TUBE PLUG This invention relates to tube plugs and more particularly to a plug for plugging heat exchanger tubes. In tube type heat exchangers, a first fluid flows through the tubes of the heat exchanger while a second fluid surrounds the tubes such that heat exchange occurs between the two fluids. Occasionally, one of the tubes can become defective such that a leak either is impending or occurs which allows the two fluids to mingle.When this occurs, it is sometimes necessary to plug the tube so that the fluid does not flow through the tube thereby preventing leakage from the tube. In nuclear reactor power plants, the tube type heat exchangers are commonly referred to as steam generators. When a defect occurs in the tubes of a nuclear steam generator that allows the coolant in the tubes to mingle with the coolant outside of the tubes, a more significant problem arises. Not only does this situation create an ineffective heat exchanger, but it also creates a radioactive contamination problem. Since the fluid flowing in the tubes of a nuclear steam generator is generally radioactive, it is important that it not be allowed to leak from the tubes and contaminate the fluid surrounding the tubes. Therefore, when a leak occurs in a nuclear steam generator heat exchange tube, the heat exchange tube is plugged so that the coolant is not permitted to flow through the tube. This prevents contamination of the fluid surrounding the tubes. There are several kinds of plugs that may be used to plug the heat exchange tubes. One such device used to plug heat exchange tubes in nuclear steam generators is an explosive plugging device. With the explosive plugging devices, a metal plug is inserted in the heat exchange tube with an explosive contained within the plug.When the explosive is detonated, the plug is forced into close contact with the inside of the tube, thus blocking flow through the tube. One problem associated with explosive plugging is that should it become necessary to replace the defective tube or defective plug, the explosive plug must be removed by machining methods which is a time consuming procedure. There are also several kinds of mechanical plugs that can be used to plug heat exchange tubes which do not use explosives. However, these mechanical plugs suffer from defects such as not being as leak tight as necessary, difficult to remove from a tube, difficult to install in a tube , or require assembly in the field. Since tube plugs to be used in a nuclear reactor environment must be easily installable, leak tight, and easily removable, the mechanical plugs known in the prior art are generally not acceptable for use in nuclear steam generators. Therefore, it is the principal object of the present invention to provide a mechanical plug that is capable of being quickly and easily installed in a heat exchange tube of a nuclear steam generator for preventing the flow of reactor coolant therethrough but which also an be removed when necessary. With this object in view, the present invention resides in a tube plug for plugging the open ends of tubes, comprising a substantially cylindrical shell having one closed end and one open end and an expander member having a conical outer surface and slidably disposed in said shell characterized in that said shell 12 is conical inside, with the smaller inside diameter being near said open end 20 and the larger inside diameter being near said closed end 18 and said expander member 14 is captured within said shell 12 with the smaller end of said expander member 14 being arranged nearer said open end 20 of said shell 12 for expanding said shell 12 when said expander member 14 is moved toward said open end 20 of said shell 12 and that a plurality of lands 24 are formed on the outside surface of said shell 12 . Motion of the expander member relative to the shell causes the shell to expand into contact with a heat exchange tube thereby plugging the tube. Preferably the expander member is formed from a hardened metal with tangentially blended leading radius and a selflocking trailing edge which provides for ease in expanding the shell while preventing inadvertent unlocking of the plug. The shell may have a substantially uniform wall thickness throughout the portion of the shell which experiences expansion so that the force necessary to perform the expanding process does not increase beyond strength limitations of installation equipment as the expander member is moved through the shell.The shell also has a plurality of lands on the outside surface thereof whose depth preferably increases from closed end to open end of the shell so that a substantially uniform wall thickness can be maintained in that region while allowing the lands to contact the inner surface of the heat exchange tube.The invention will become more readily apparent from the following description, of a preferred embodiment thereof shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of the tube plug Figure 2 is a cross sectional view in elevation of the tube plug, installation apparatus, and heat exchange tube Figure 3 is a cross sectional view in elevation of the tube plug and installation apparatus in the expanded position and Figure 4 is a cross sectional view in elevation of the tube plug in a heat exchange tube in the expanded position. Referring to Figure 1, a tube plug referred to generally as 10, comprises a shell 12 and an expander member 14. Shell 12 may be a substantially cylindrical member manufactured from a metal such as Inconel. Shell 12 has a conical inner surface 16 which has a larger diameter at the closed end 18 and a smaller diameter at the open end 20. Inner surface 16 is arranged such that expander member 14 is captured within shell 12 so that movement of expander member 14 relative to inner surface 16 toward the shell s open end causes the shell 12 to expand without allowing expander member 14 to be removed from the shell 12. Shell 12 also has a threaded bore 22 near open end 20 which has a diameter larger than the smallest diameter of inner surface 16 which allows apparatus to be inserted through threaded bore 22 and into the interior of shell 12.Shell 12 also has a substantially uniform wall thickness in the portion of shell 12 that is expanded by expander member 14. In this portion of shell 12 the wall thickness does not vary by substantially more than i 10 of the nominal wall thickness which allows for a somewhat uniformly increasing pulling force to expand shell 12 by expander member 14. In addition, a plurality of lands 24 are formed on the outside surface of shell 12 in a manner such that the height of each land 24 increases from closed end 18 to open end 20 while the outer surfaces of all lands 24 are maintained at approximately the same external diameter and while the wall thickness of shell 12 remains substantially constant throughout the portion of shell 12 wherein lands 24 are located. Shell 12 is also constructed such that the area near open end 20 has a thicker wall section than the remainder of shell 12 to provide stability in extracting tube plug 10. Still referring to Figure 1, expander member 14 may be manufactured from a hardenable metal such as stain less steel alloy Carpenter 455 and is formed such that it has a leading end 26 which has a tangentially blended radius that minimizes plowing or pushing metal ahead of expander member 14 when expander member 14 is pulled through shell 12. A lubricant such as graplite suspended in alcohol may be applied to expander member 14 to aid in its sliding movement. Expander member 14 may also have a polished exterior surface that enhances its movement relative to shell 12. Expander member 14 also has a trailing edge 28 which is formed to have a sharp edge such that it provides a self locking mechanism. The sharp edge feature of trailing edge 28 restrains expander member 14 from moving toward closed end 18 of shell 12, thereby preventing inadvertent diametral contraction of shell 12.However, the construction of expander member 14 is such that the sharp edge feature of trailing edge 28 does not prevent expander member 14 from being pushed toward closed end 18 by a plug removal tool. Expander member 14 is also provided with a conical outer surface 30 that is arranged such that its outside diameter is smaller near leading edge 26 and larger near trailing edge 28. The shape of outer surface 30 provides a mechanism for expanding shell 12 when expander member 14 is moved relative to shell 12.Expander member 14 also has internal threads 32 which can be used for gripping expander member 14 during the expansion process. In addition, a counterbore 34 is provided near the end of expander member 14 which prevents expander member 14 from gripping the pulling device too tightly. OPERATION Referring now to Figures 2, 3, and 4, when inserting a tube plug 10 in a heat exchange tube of a nuclear steam generator, it is imperative that tube plug 10 be capable of being inserted therein in a quick and efficient manner due to the radioactive nature of the environment. Therefore, before workmen enter the steam generator, draw bar 36 which is attached to hydraulic cylinder 38 chosen from those. well knows in. the art is threaded into internal threads 32 of expander member 14.In this position, hydraulic cylinder 38 is in contact with open end 20 of shell 12 and draw bar 36 is in contact with expander member 14. Workmen then insert tube plug 10 into heat exchange tube 40 as shown in Figure 2. When in this position, tube plug 10 fits easily but snugly into heat exchange tube 40. Next, hydraulic cylinder 38 is activated to exert a force of approximately between 12,000 lb.and 22,000 lb. which causes draw bar 36 to be moved toward hydraulic cylinder 38 and which in turn pulls expander member 14 relative to shell 12 as shown in Figure 3.Since shell 12 is being restrained by hydraulic cylinder 38, the relative motion of expander member 14 may be accomplished by the single action of draw bar 36. As shown in Figure 3, the relative movement of expander member 14 with respect to inner surface 16 causes shell 12 to expand until lands 24 contact heat exchange tube 40. The tangentially blended radius of leading end 26 allows for a smooth movement of expander member 14. As expander member 14 is moved relative to shell 12, the metal in the wall of shell 12 tends to flow around the corner of trailing edge 28 of expander member 14 such that inadvertent backward motion of expander member 14 is lessened which provides a self locking feature. Once tube plug 10 has been expanded, draw bar 36 may be unthreaded from expander member 14 and removed which results in tube plug 10 being in the locked position as shown in Figure 4. When in the locked position a plurality of lands 24 are impressed in the wall of heat exchange tube 40.Lands 24 thereby establish a type of labyrinth seal along the inner surface of heat exchange tube 40 which prevents fluid from flowing therethrough. Moreover, since shell 12 has a closed end 18 there is no potential leak path through tube plug 10 which is not the case in many tube plugs having more than one part. It has been found that during the locking process typical expander members may tend to grip drawbar 36 so tightly that subsequent removal of drawbar 36 may be extremely difficult. The present invention circumverts this problem by using a hardenable stainless steel alloy such as Carpenter 455 and having counterbore 34 arranged near the end of internal threads 32 so that drawbar 36 may be unthreaded from internal threads 32 even though expander member 14 is experiencing compressive stresses. When it becomes necessary to remove tube plug 10 from heat exchange tube 40, a plug removal apparatus such as that described in copending United States Patent Application Serial No. 129,538, entitled Plug Removal Apparatus filed in the name of W. F. Nanstiel et al. may be used to move expander member 14 to its initial position as shown in Figure 1. Moving expander member 14 to its initial position relieves stress on shell 12 which relieves pressure between lands 24 and heat exchange tube 40 thereby allowing tube plug 10 to be removed from heat exchange tube 40. Once expander member 14 has been moved to near the closed end 18 of shell 12, a device may be threaded into internal threads 22 for pulling tube plug 10 from heat exchange tube 40. An important advantage in having threaded bore 22 near open end 20 arises from the fact that when tube plug 10 is pulled from heat exchange tube 40 in the extraction process, the pulling action tends to elongate the tube plug 10 which simultaneously causes a reduction in diameter of tube plug 10 thereby facilitating the extraction process. The uniform wall thickness of tube plug 10 along the portion of tube plug 10 that contacts heat exchange tube 40 provides for a relatively uniform axial stress during the extraction process which also facilitates the removal of tube plug 10. Therefore, it can be seen that the invention provides a mechanical tube plug capable of being quickly and easily installed in a heat exchange tube of a nuclear steam generator that is both leak tight and easily removable.
