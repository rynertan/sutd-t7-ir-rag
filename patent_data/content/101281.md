# Underwater seismic testing.

## Abstract
A method of marine seismic investigation involves positioning or deploying at a predetermined point close to or within a multi element seismic source array a calibration source which is an acoustic pressure wave point source which has a far field seismic signature of broad bandwidth. The radiated pressure wave field of the calibration source 3 is weaker than that of the main source 2 . The two sources are fired at separate instants within a predetermined time range, preferably with the calibration source 3 being fired about two seconds before the main source 2 . The reflected response of the sub surface strata is recorded and processed to generate seismic data. In one embodiment, the response is recorded with two hydrophone arrays a short high resolution array 4 and a conventional main array 5 . The method can be used to determine the far field signature of the main source array 2 . It can also be used to obtain a high resolution shallow seismic section simultaneously with a deep seismic section. Apparatus suitable for the method is described, and also a method of conducting an underwater seismic survey.
