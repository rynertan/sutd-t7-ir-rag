# Power assisted dump valve.

## Abstract
A high pressure fluid system for providing fluid to a hand held nozzle, comprising an improved power assisted dump valve which may be remotely located and controlled. The dump valve includes a stepped piston positioned in a stepped bore with one end of the piston adapted for sealing off a pressure relief outlet. A fluid conduit, preferably a passageway through the piston, conducts high pressure fluid to the valve chamber at the large diameter end of the piston. A control valve either seals off the large diameter end of the chamber or vents it to ambient pressure so that differential pressure supplied by the working fluid itself drives the valve piston to its open or closed positions. An electrical, hydraulic, or mechanical actuator operates the control valve, remotely if desired, to control the flow of high pressure fluid to the nozzle.
