# Use of vinyl phenol polymer as colour developer for leuco pigment and colour developer composition and thermosensitive recording element comprising same.

## Abstract
Disclosed is the use as a phenolic colour developer for a leuco pigment of an oligomer or polymer of a vinyl phenol. When this colour developer is used for developing, for example by thermosensitive, pressuresensitive or electrostatic photo graphic development, the colour of a leuco pigment, a colour having a high density is developed even if the leuco pigment concentration is low.
