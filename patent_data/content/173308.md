# Combination measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
A combination measuring apparatus including a plurali ty of heads provided on a machine frame. The discharge plates of the pool hoppers provided in these heads are opened and closed to throw a predetermined material to be measured into the measuring hoppers provided on the lower side of the pool hoppers. The weight of the material in each measuring hopper is measured with a weight mea suring device, such as a load cell. A combination of measur ing hoppers, the weight of the material in which is the clo sest to a target weight set by the combination computation of the detected weights in all of the heads, are determined. The discharge plates of the selected measuring hoppers are opened to discharge the material therefrom, and supply the material to a subsequent stage, for example, a stage pro vided with a packaging machine. The discharge plates of the pool hoppers and measuring hoppers are opened and closed in accordance with the vertical movement, which is effected by the power from a driving unit, of a discharge plate opening and closing unit provided on the central por tion of the machine frame.
