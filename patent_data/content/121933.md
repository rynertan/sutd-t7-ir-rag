# Shell type electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A shell type electrostatic copying apparatus comprising a supporting structure consisting of a lower supporting frame 110 and an upper supporting frame 112 pivotally mounted on the lower supporting frame 110 , a rotating drum 12 rotatably mounted on the supporting structure, a copying paper feed device 40a, 40b, 40c and a copying paper conveying mechanism including a plurality of lower elements 56, 66, 74 and a plurality of upper elements 58, 68, 72 for conducting a copying paper delivered from the paper feed device to the rotating drum 12 . A conveying unit frame 234 is pivotably mounted on the supporting structure. At least one of the upper elements is mounted on the conveying unit frame 234 , and at least one of the lower elements, on the lower supporting frame 110 . The appara tus also includes a drum unit frame 148 having the rotating drum 12 rotatably mounted thereon. A provisional unit placing means 274 for supporting the drum unit frame 148 movably is provided in the lower supporting frame 110 and or the conveying unit frame 234 . The drum unit including the drum unit frame 148 is provisionally placed on the provisional unit placing means 274 , and then in the required manner, mounted detachably on the upper sup porting frame 112 .
