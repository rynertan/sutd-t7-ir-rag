Cointegrales Plasmid zur Verwendung beim Transformieren von Pflanzenzellen und gebildet durch Rekombination durch einen einzigen Crossover

## Description
This invention is in the fields of genetic engineering, plant biology, and bacteriology. In the past decade, the science of genetic engineering has developed rapidly. A variety of processes are known for inserting a heterologous gene into bacteria, whereby the bacteria become capable of efficient expression of the inserted genes. Such processes normally involve the use of plasmids which may be cleaved at one or more selected cleavage sites by restriction endonucleases. Typically, a gene of interest is obtained by cleaving one piece of DNA, and the resulting DNA fragment is mixed with a fragment obtained by cleaving a vector such as a plasmid. The different strands of DNA are then connected ligated to each other to form a reconstituted plasmid. See, for example, U.S. Patents 4,237,224 Cohen and Boyer, 1980 4,264,731 Shine, 1981 4,273,875 Manis, 1981 4,322,499 Baxter et al, 1982 , and 4,336,336 Silhavy et al, 1982 . A variety of other reference works are available. Some of these works describe the natural process whereby DNA is transcribed into mRNA and mRNA is translated into protein, see, e.g., L. Stryer, Most of the genetic engineering work performed to date involves the insertion of genes into various types of cells, primarily bacteria such as As used herein, the term plant refers to a multicellular differentiated organism that is capable of photosynthesis, such as angiosperms and multicellular algae. This does not include microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi. The term plant cell includes any cell derived from a plant this includes undifferentiated tissue such as callus or crown gall tumor, as well as plant seeds, propagules, pollen, or plant embryos. The tumor inducing Ti plasmid of Research by several laboratories has led to the characterization of several structural i.e., protein coding genes located in T DNA Garfinkel et al 1981 Leemans et al 1982 , as well as other DNA sequences which appear to serve various other functions. For example, two sequences referred to as the left border and the right border appear to delineate T DNA and may be involved in the process whereby T DNA is transferred into plant chromosomes Zambryski et al 1982 . A different species of Various other bacteria are also reported to be capable of causing genetic transformation of plant cells, including As used herein, the term Ti plasmid includes any plasmid 1 which is contained in a microorganism, other than a virus, which is capable of causing genetic transformation of one or more types of plants or plant cells, and 2 which contains a segment of DNA which is inserted into a plant genome. This includes Ri plasmids. As used herein, the term T DNA refers to a segment of DNA in or from a Ti plasmid 1 which has been inserted into the genome of one or more types of plant cells, or 2 which is contained in a segment of DNA that is located between two sequences of bases which are capable of serving as T DNA borders. As used herein, the terms T DNA border and border are determined and applied empirically these terms shall refer to a sequence of bases which appears at or near the end of a segment of DNA which is transferred from a Ti plasmid into a plant genome. Despite the existing knowledge of T DNA and Ti plasmids, no one prior to this invention has been able to utilize these vectors for the introduction of foreign genes which are expressed in genetically modified plants. A variety of obstacles to such use have been encountered in genetic engineering efforts. Such obstacles include As described above, simple recombinant DNA techniques for introducing foreign genes into plasmids are not applicable to the large Ti plasmid. As a result, several indirect methods have been developed and are discussed below. The first reported use of the Ti plasmid as a vector was in model experiments in which bacterial transposons were inserted into T DNA and subsequently introduced into plant cells. The bacterial transposons were reported to be stably maintained in the plant genome Hernalsteens et al, 1980 Garfinkel et al 1981 . However, in these cases the transformed tumor tissues were found to be incapable of regeneration into normal plants, and there was no reported evidence for the expression of bacterial genes in the plant cells. In addition, because the insertion of bacterial transposons is believed to be essentially random, a great deal of effort was required to identify and localize the position of the inserted DNA in these examples. In later experiments, J. Leemans, H. de Greve et al 1982 demonstrated the expression of dihydrofolate reductase, a characteristic product of the bacterial Tn 7 transposon, by crown gall tobacco cells that had been transformed by mutant Ti plasmids containing the Tn 7 transposon sequence in the T DNA. The authors speculate that it should be possible to insert, behind the T DNA promotors for opine synthesis, the sequences of bacterial genes that code for functions that inactivate other antibiotics. Thus they suppose it might be possible to achieve good expression and possibly sufficient antibiotic resistance to allow for direct selection of the transformed plant cells. Other researchers have reported the use of intermediate vectors which replicate in both Various foreign DNA s have been inserted at specific sites in the T DNA by this method and they have been reported to be stably transferred into plant cells Matzke and Chilton, 1981, Leemans et al 1981, 1982 . However, such foreign genes have not been reported to be capable of expression in plant cells. Possible reasons for this are discussed by M D Chilton et al 1981 . For example it is suggested that the length and sequence of the 5 untranslated portion of the transcript could affect the efficiency of capping, splicing, transport to the cytoplasm or initiation of translation. Furthermore, in the procedure described above, it is preferred for a double crossover event to occur, in order to substitute the modified DNA fragment for the wild type copy. A single crossover results in the formation of a co integrate plasmid which contains two copies of the T DNA subfragments. This duplication is undesirable in these methods since homologous recombination, which can occur in A major disadvantage of the above methods is that the frequency of double recombination is quite low, about 10 ⁴ to 10 ⁹ Leemans et al, 1981 and it requires extensive effort to identify and isolate the rare double crossover recombinants. As a result, the number and types of experiments which can be performed using existing methods for genetically engineering the Ti plasmid is severely limited. Choudary et al, 1982 using a similar procedure, report the transfer of the gene for phaseolin from bean to sunflower plant cells, using recombinant cells of Another report on the prospects of using the Ti plasmids of Agrobacteria as vectors for the genetic manipulation of plants is that of Ream and Gordon 1982 . EP A 0 116 718 which is prior art relative to the present application under Article 54 3 EPC, describes modified acceptor Ti plasmids which allow the introduction of any gene s of interest contained within an intermediate cloning vector carrying a region of homology with a corresponding region in the acceptor Ti plasmid. This introduction is achieved in However, the hybrid Ti plasmids of EP A 0 116 718 that are produced by the single crossover event have two copies of T DNA subfragments. This duplication is undesirable for the reason referred to above. A variety of other methods has been reported for inserting DNA into plant cells. One such method involves the use of lipid vesicles, also called liposomes, to encapsulate one or more DNA molecules. The liposomes and their DNA contents may be taken up by plant cells see, e.g., Lurquin, 1981. If the inserted DNA can be incorporated into the plant genome, replicated, and inherited, the plant cells will be transformed. Other techniques involve contacting plant cells with DNA which is complexed with either a polycationic substances, such as poly L ornithine Davey et al, 1980 , or b calcium phosphate Krens et al, 1982 . Using these techniques, all or part of a Ti plasmid has been reportedly inserted into plant cells, causing tumorigenic alteration of the plant cells. Another method has been developed involving the fusion of bacteria, which contain desired plasmids, with plant cells. Such methods involve converting the bacteria into spheroplasts and converting the plant cells into protoplasts. Both of these methods remove the cell wall barrier from the bacterial and plant cells, using enzymic digestion. The two cell types can then be fused together by exposure to chemical agents, such a polyethylene glycol. See Hasezawa et al, 1981. However, all of the foregoing techniques suffer from one or more of the following problems i transformation efficiencies reported to date have been very low ii only small DNA molecules can be inserted into plant cells iii only small numbers of DNA molecules can be inserted into plant cells and or iv a gene which is inserted into a plant cell will not be stably maintained by the plant cell unless it is incorporated into the genome of the plant cell, i.e., unless the gene is inserted into a chromosome or plasmid that replicates in the plant cell. Prior to this invention, no satisfactory method existed for the creation and identification of genetically transformed plant cells which could be routinely regenerated into morphologically normal plants. This invention relates to several plasmids which are useful for creating transformed plant cells which are capable of subsequent regeneration into differentiated, morphologically normal plants. This invention also relates to microorganisms containing such plasmids, and to methods for creating such plasmids and microorganisms. This invention involves a first plasmid, such as pMON120, which has certain desired characteristics described below. A gene which is capable of being expressed in plant cells may be inserted into this plasmid to obtain a derivative plasmid, such as pMON128. For example, plasmid pMON128 contains a chimeric gene which expresses neomycin phosphotransferase II NPT II , an enzyme which inactivates certain antibiotics. The chimeric gene is capable of expression in plant cells. The derivative plasmid is inserted into a suitable microorganism, such as Because of the characteristics of the inserted plasmid of this invention, the resulting co integrate Ti plasmid contains the chimeric gene and or any other inserted gene within the T DNA region of the co integrate plasmid. The inserted gene s are surrounded by at least two T DNA borders, at least one of which was inserted into the Ti plasmid by the crossover event. By means of appropriate antibiotics, A variety of uses exist for plants transformed by the method of this invention. For example, a gene which codes for an enzyme which inactivates a herbicide may be inserted into a plant. This would make the plant and its descendants resistant to the herbicide. Alternately, a gene which codes for a desired mammalian polypeptide such as growth hormone, insulin, interferon, or somatostatin may be inserted into plants. The plants may be grown and harvested, and the polypeptide could be extracted from the plant tissue. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, a variety of chimeric genes were inserted into plant cells using the steps that are summarized on the flow chart of Figure 1. As shown on Figure 1, three preliminary plasmids were prepared. Those plasmids were designated as After these plasmids were assembled, each plasmid was digested by appropriate endonucleases to obtain a desired fragment. Three fragments one from each of the three plasmids were assembled in a triple ligation to obtain the intermediate vector, plasmid pMON120, as shown in Figure 7. Plasmid pMON120 plays a key role in the embodiment of this invention that is described in detail below. This plasmid has the following characteristics It is recognized that a wide variety of intermediate vectors which differ from pMON120 in one or more respects may be prepared and utilized by those skilled in the art. For example, the NOS marker used for scoring transformed plant cells might be deleted, or replaced or supplemented by a different scorable or selectable marker. One such marker gene might comprise an antibiotic resistance gene such as the NOS NPT II NOS chimeric gene described below. As another example, the spc str marker gene used for selecting Plasmid pMON120 was constructed from fragments derived from 3 other plasmids. These three plasmids were designated as pMON41, pMON109, and pMON113. The construction of each of these three plasmids is summarized below additional information is provided in the examples. A nopaline type Ti plasmid, designated as the pTiT37 plasmid, may be digested with the HindIII endonuclease to produce a variety of fragments, including a 3.4 kb fragment which is designated as the HindIII 23 fragment. This fragment contains the entire NOS gene and the T DNA right border. The Applicants inserted a HindIII 23 fragment into a plasmid, pBR327 Soberon et al, 1980 , which had been digested with HindIII. The resulting plasmid, designated as pMON38, was digested with both HindIII and BamHI. This produced a 2.3 kb fragment which contains the nopaline type right border and the 5 portion of a NOS gene including the promoter region, the 5 non translated region, and part of the structural sequence . This 2.3 kb fragment was inserted into a pBR327 plasmid which had been digested with HindIII and BamHI. The resulting plasmid was designated as pMON41, as shown in Figure 2. A variety of strains of Plasmid pMON109 contributed a spc str selectable marker gene and the 3 portion of a NOS gene to pMON120. It was created by the following method. Plasmid pMON38 described above and shown on Figure 2 was digested with RsaI, which creates blunt ends as shown 5 GTAC A bacterial transposon, designated as Tn7, is known to contain the spc str gene, mentioned previously. The Tn7 transposon also contains a gene which causes the host cell to be resistant to the antibiotic trimethoprim. The exact location and orientation of the spc str gene and the trimethoprim resistance gene in Tn7, are not known. The Tn7 transposon may be obtained from a variety of cell strains which are publicly available. A strain of Plasmid pGV3106 was digested with HindIII, and the fragments were shotgun cloned into pBR327 plasmids which had been digested with HindIII. These plasmids were inserted into E. coli cells, and cells which were ampicillin resistant due to a pBR327 gene and trimethoprim resistant due to a Tn7 gene were selected. The plasmid obtained from one colony was designated as pMON31. This plasmid contained a 6kb HindIII insert. The insert contained the spc str resistance gene and trimethoprim resistance gene from Tn7, and the 3 portion of a NOS gene which came from the pTiT37 plasmid . Plasmid pMON31 was reduced in size twice. The first reduction was performed by digesting the plasmid with EcoRI, diluting the mixture to remove an 850 bp fragment, and religating the large fragment. The resulting plasmid, designated as pMON53, was obtained from transformed cells selected by their resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin. Resistance to trimethoprim was not determined. Plasmid pMON53 was further reduced in size by digesting the plasmid with ClaI, diluting the mixture to remove a 2 kb fragment, and religating the large fragment. The resulting 5.2 kb plasmid was designated as pMON54, as shown in Figure 4. This plasmid contains the spc str gene. Plasmid pMON54 was digested with EcoRI and PstI, and a 4.8 kb fragment containing the spc str gene was isolated. M 4 DNA was digested with EcoRI and PstI, and a 740 bp fragment containing the NOS 3 non translated region was isolated. These fragments were ligated together to form pMON64. In order to be able to obtain the NOS 3 portion and the spc str gene on a single EcoRI BamHI fragment, the orientation of the spc str gene was reversed by digesting pMON64 with ClaI and religating the mixture. Plasmids having the desired orientation were identified by cleavage using EcoRI and BamHI. These plasmids were designated as pMON109, as shown in Figure 5. A region of homology may be derived from any type of plasmid capable of transforming plant cells, such as any Ti plasmid or any Ri plasmid. An intermediate vector can be designed which can form a co integrate plasmid with whatever type of plasmid the region of homology was derived from. In addition, it might not be necessary for the region of homology to be located within the T DNA. For example, it may be possible for a region of homology to be derived from a segment of a Ti plasmid which contains a T DNA border and a sequences of bases outside of the T DNA region. Indeed, if the intermediate vector contains two appropriate T DNA borders, it might be possible for the region of homology to be located entirely outside of the T DNA region. The Applicants obtained an Plasmid pMON90 was digested with BglII, and a 2.6 kb fragment which contains the LIH region but not the left border was purified. The 2.6 kb fragment was treated with Klenow polymerase to convert the cohesive ends into blunt ends, and the fragment was digested with HindIII to obtain a 1.6 kb fragment the desired fragment and a 1 kb fragment. Both fragments were mixed with a pBR322 plasmid which had been digested with PvuII and HindIII. The mixture was ligated, and inserted into To assemble pMON120, three fragments had to be isolated. Plasmid pMON41 was digested with PvuI and BamI, and a 1.5 kb fragment containing a nopaline type right border and the 5 portion of a NOS gene was isolated. Plasmid pMON109 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and a 3.4 kb fragment containing a spc str gene and the 3 part of a NOS gene was isolated. Plasmid pMON113 was digested with PvuI and EcoRI, and a 3.1 kb fragment containing the LIH region was isolated. The three fragments were mixed together and ligated to form pMON120, as shown on Figure 7. A culture of It is recognized that a variety of different methods could be used to create pMON120, or any similar intermediate vector. For example, instead of the triple ligation, it would have been possible to assemble two of the desired fragments in a plasmid, and insert the third fragment into the plasmid. As mentioned previously, pMON120 has three unique cleavage sites EcoRI, ClaI, and HindIII which are suitable for the insertion of any desired gene. These cleavage sites are located in the portion of pMON120 that will be inserted into a plant genome, so the inserted gene also will be inserted into the plant genome. A variety of chimeric genes which are capable of expressing bacterial and mammalian polypeptides in plant cells have been created by the Applicants. These chimeric genes are described in detail in a separate application entitled Chimeric Genes Suitable for Expression in Plant Cells, copending U.S. application serial number 458,414, filed on January 17, 1983. Those chimeric genes are suitable for use in this invention. They may be inserted into pMON120 to create a derivative plasmid, which may be utilized as described below. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, a chimeric gene was created which comprises the following DNA sequences This chimeric NOS NPT II NOS gene was isolated on a DNA fragment having EcoRI ends. This fragment was inserted into the EcoRI cleavage site of pMON120, and the resulting plasmids having chimeric gene inserts with opposite orientations were designated as pMON128 and pMON129, as shown in Figure 8. Plasmid pMON129 has two copies of the chimeric gene this may be a useful feature in certain types of work. Either plasmid may be utilized to transform plant cells, in the following manner. A culture of Plasmid pMON128 or any other plasmid derived by inserting a desired gene into pMON120 is inserted into a microorganism which contains an octopine type Ti plasmid or other suitable plasmid . Suitable microorganisms include The plasmid may be inserted into the microorganism by any desired method, such as transformation i.e., contacting plasmids with cells that have been treated to increase their uptake of DNA or conjugation with cells that contain the pMON128 or other plasmids. The inserted plasmid such as pMON128 has a region which is homologous to a sequence within the Ti plasmid. This LIH region of homology allows a single crossover event whereby pMON128 and an octopine type Ti plasmid combine with each other to form a co integrate plasmid. See, e.g., Stryer, The inserted plasmid, such as pMON128, combines with the Ti plasmid in the manner represented by Figures 9 or 10, depending upon what type of Ti plasmid is involved. In Figure 9, item 2 represents the T DNA portion of an octopine type Ti plasmid. Item 4 represents the inserted plasmid, such as pMON128. When these two plasmids co exist in the same cell, a crossover event can occur which results in the creation of co integrate plasmid 6. Co integrate plasmid 6 has one left border 8, and two right borders 10 and 12. The two right borders are designated herein as the proximal right border 10 the right border closest to left border 8 , and the distal right border 12 the right border that is more distant from left border 8. Proximate right border 10 was carried by plasmid 4 the distal right border was contained on Ti plasmid 2 before co integration. A culture of When co integrate Ti plasmid 6, shown in Figure 9, is inserted into a plant cell, either of two regions of DNA may enter the plant genome, T DNA region 14 or T DNA region 16. T DNA region 14 is bounded by left border 8 and proximate right border 10. Region 14 contains the chimeric gene and any other genes contained in plasmid 4, such as the spc str selectable marker and the NOS scorable marker. However, region 14 does not contain any of the T DNA genes which would cause crown gall disease or otherwise disrupt the metabolism or regenerative capacity of the plant cell. T DNA region 16 contains left border 8 and both right borders 10 and 12. This segment of T DNA contains the chimeric gene and any other genes contained in plasmid 4. However, T DNA region 16 also contains the T DNA genes which are believed to cause crown gall disease. Either of the foregoing T DNA segments, Region 14 or Region 16, might be transferred to the plant DNA. This is presumed to occur at a 50 50 probability for any given T DNA transfer. This is likely to lead to a mixture of transformed cells, some of which are tumorous and some or which are non tumorous. It is possible to isolate and cultivate non tumorous cells from the mixture, as described in the examples. An alternate approach has also been developed which avoids the need for isolating tumorous from non tumorous cells. Several mutant strains of Various other types of disarmed Ti plasmids may be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. See Matzke and Chilton, 1981 Leemans et al, 1981 Koekman et al, 1979. Figure 10 represents an octopine type Ti plasmid with a T DNA region 22 which undergoes mutation to delete the tms and tmr genes and the right border. This results in a disarmed Ti plasmid with partial T DNA region 24. When plasmid 26 such as pMON128 is inserted into a cell that carries the disarmed Ti plasmid 24, a crossover event occurs which creates a co integrate Ti plasmid with disarmed T DNA region 28. The LIH region of homology is repeated in this Ti plasmid, but the disarmed Ti plasmid does not contain any oncogenic genes. Alternately, if only the right border had been deleted from T DNA region 22, then the tms and tmr genes and the octopine synthase OCS gene would be contained in the co integrate disarmed Ti plasmid however, they would have been located outside of the T DNA borders. The disarmed co integrate Ti plasmid is used to infect plant cells, and T DNA region 28 enters the plant genome, as shown by transformed DNA 30. Plant cells transformed by disarmed T DNA 28 have normal phytohormone metabolism, and normal capability to be regenerated into differentiated plants. After pMON128 is inserted into The Ti plasmid 28, shown in Figure 10, contains two LIH regions. It is possible that co integrate Ti plasmids will undergo a subsequent crossover event, wherein the two LIH regions will recombine. This event is undesirable, since it can lead to a deletion of the DNA between the LIH regions, including the chimeric gene. However, this is not likely to lead to serious difficulties, for two reasons. First, this event is likely to occur at a relatively low probability, such as about 10 2. Second, plasmid pMON120 and its derivatives have been designed so that the selectable marker gene spc str is located in the region of DNA that would be deleted by the crossover event. Therefore, the selective conditions that are used to identify and culture Only one of the LIH regions in the co integrate Ti plasmid will be inserted into the plant genome, as shown in Figure 10. This important feature results from the design of pMON120, and it distinguishes this co integrate plasmid from undesired co integrate plasmids formed by the prior art. The LIH region which lies outside of the T DNA borders will not be inserted into the plant genome. This leads to at least two important advantages. First, the presence of two LIH regions inserted into the plant genome could result in crossover events which would lead to loss of the inserted genes in the transformed plant cells and their progeny. Second, the presence of two regions of DNA homology can significantly complicate efforts to analyze the DNA inserted into the plant genome Matzke and Chilton, 1981 . After The plant cells to be transformed are contacted with enzymes which remove the cell walls. This converts the plant cells into protoplasts, which are viable cells surrounded by membranes. The enzymes are removed, and the protoplasts begin to regenerate cell wall material. At an appropriate time, the Plant cells which have been transformed i.e., cells which have received DNA from the co integrate Ti plasmids and their descendants may be selected by a variety of methods, depending upon the type of gene s that were inserted into the plant genome. For example, certain genes may cause various antibiotics to be inactivated such genes include the chimeric NOS NPT II NOS gene carried by pMON128. Such genes may serve as selectable markers a group of cells may be cultured on medium containing the antibiotic which is inactivated by the chimeric gene product, and only those cells containing the selectable marker gene will survive. A variety of genes may serve as scorable markers in plant cells. For example, pMON120 and its derivative plasmids, such as pMON128, carry a nopaline synthase NOS gene which is expressed in plant cells. This gene codes for an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of nopaline. Nopaline is a non detrimental compound which usually is accumulated at low quantities in most types of plants it can be easily detected by electrophoretic or chromatographic methods. If a plant is transformed by a gene which creates a polypeptide that is difficult to detect, then the presence of a selectable marker gene such as the NOS NPT II NOS chimeric gene or a scorable marker gene such as the NOS gene in the transforming vector may assist in the identification and isolation of transformed cells. Virtually any desired gene may be inserted into pMON120 or other plasmids which are designed to form co integrates with Ti or similar plasmids. For example, the Applicants have created a variety of chimeric genes, which are discussed in the previously cited application, Chimeric Genes Suitable for Expression in Plant Cells. The suitability of any gene for use in this invention may be determined through routine experimentation by those skilled in the art. Such usage is not limited to chimeric genes for example, this invention may be used to insert multiple copies of a natural gene into plant cells. This invention is suitable for use with a wide variety of plants, as may be determined through routine experimentation by those skilled in the art. For example, this invention is likely to be useful to transform cells from any type of plant which can be infected by bacteria from the genus Certain types of plant cells can be cultured The As mentioned previously, it is not essential to this invention that co cultivation be utilized to transfer the co integrate plasmids of this invention into plant cells. A variety of other methods are being used to insert DNA into cells. Such methods include encapsulation of DNA in liposomes, complexing the DNA with chemicals such as polycationic substances or calcium phosphate, fusion of bacterial spheroplasts with plant protoplasts, microinjection of DNA into a cell, and induction of DNA uptake by means of electric current. Although such methods have not been used to insert DNA into plant cells with satisfactory efficiency to date, they are being actively researched and they may be useful for inserting foreign genes into plant cells, using the intermediate vectors and co integrate plasmids of this invention, or plasmids derived therefrom. This invention may be useful for a wide variety of purposes. For example, certain bacterial enzymes, such as 5 enol pyruvyl shikimate 3 phosphoric acid synthase EPSP synthase are inactivated by certain herbicides other enzymes, such as glutathione S transferase GST , inactivate certain herbicides. It may be possible to insert chimeric genes into plants which will cause expression of such enzymes in the plants, thereby causing the plants to become resistant to one or more herbicides. This would allow for the herbicide, which would normally kill the untransformed plant, to be applied to a field of transformed plants. The herbicide would serve as a weed killer, leaving the transformed plants undamaged. Alternately, it may be possible to insert chimeric genes into plants which will cause the plants to create mammalian polypeptides, such as insulin, interferon, growth hormone, etc. At an appropriate time, the plants or cultured plant tissue would be harvested. Using a variety of processes which are known to those skilled in the art, the desired protein may be extracted from the harvested plant tissue. An alternate use of this invention is to create plants with high content of desired substances, such as storage proteins or other proteins. For example, a plant might contain one or more copies of a gene which codes for a desirable protein. Additional copies of this gene may be inserted into the plant by means of this invention. Alternately, the structural sequence of the gene might be inserted into a chimeric gene under the control of a different promoter which causes prolific transcription of the structural sequence. The methods of this invention may be used to identify, isolate, and study DNA sequences to determine whether they are capable of promoting or otherwise regulating the expression of genes within plant cells. For example, the DNA from any type of cell can be fragmented, using partial endonuclease digestion or other methods. The DNA fragments can be inserted randomly into plasmids similar to pMON128. These plasmids, instead of having a full chimeric gene such as NOS NPT II NOS, will have a partial chimeric gene, with a cleavage site for the insertion of DNA fragments, rather than a NOS promoter or other promoter. The plasmids with inseted DNA are then inserted into Using this method, it is possible to evaluate the promoter regions of bacteria, yeast, fungus, algae, other microorganisms, and animal cells to determine whether they function as gene promoters in various types of plant cells. It is also possible to evaluate promoters from one type of plant in other types of plant cells. By using similar methods and varying the cleavage site in the starting plasmid, it is possible to evaluate the performance of any DNA sequence as a 5 non translated region, a 3 non translated region, or any other type of regulatory sequence. As used herein, a piece of DNA includes plasmids, phages, DNA fragments, and polynucleotides, whether natural or synthetic. As used herein, a chimeric piece of DNA is limited to a piece of DNA which contains at least two portions i.e., two nucleotide sequences that were derived from different and distinct pieces of DNA. For example, a chimeric piece of DNA cannot be created by merely deleting one or more portions of a naturally existing plasmid. A chimeric piece of DNA may be produced by a variety of methods, such as ligating two fragments from different plasmids together, or by synthesizing a polynucleotide wherein the sequence of bases was determined by analysis of the base sequences of two different plasmids. As used herein, a chimeric piece of DNA is limited to DNA which has been assembled, synthesized, or otherwise produced as a result of man made efforts, and any piece of DNA which is replicated or otherwise derived therefrom. Man made efforts include enzymatic, cellular, and other biological processes, if such processes occur under conditions which are caused, enhanced, or controlled by human effort or intervention this excluses plasmids, phages, and polynucleotides which are created solely by natural processes. As used herein, the term derived from shall be construed broadly. Whenever used in a claim, the term chimeric shall be a material limitation. As used herein, foreign DNA includes any DNA which is inserted into a pre existing plant cell. A foreign gene is a gene which is inserted into a pre existing plant cell. As used herein, a marker gene is a gene which confers a phenotypically identifiable trait upon the host cell which allows transformed host cells to be distinguished from non transformed cells. This includes screenable, scorable, and selectable markers. As used herein, a region of homology refers to a sequence of bases in one plasmid which has sufficient correlation with a sequence of bases in a different plasmid to cause recombination of the plasmid to occur at a statistically determinable frequency. Preferably, such recombination should occur at a frequency which allows for the convenient selection of cells having combined plasmids, e.g., greater than 1 per 10⁶ cells. This term is described more fully in a variety of publications, e.g., Leemans et al, 1981. By tumorigenic genes is meant those genes of the Ti plasmid whose presence in the transformed plant results in a morphologically abnormal plant, i.e. induces crown gall formation. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention discussed herein. Such equivalents are within the scope of this invention. A culture of The mixture was incubated at 22 Fifty ug of pMON38 DNA were digested with HindIII and BamHI 50 units each, 2 hours, 37 Thirty ug of plasmid pMON38 described in Example 1 were digested with RsaI 30 units, 2 hours, 37 Twenty ug of plasmid pGV3106 Hernalsteens et al 1980, prepared by the method of Currier and Nester 1976 was digested with HindIII 20 units, 2 hours, 37 Plasmid pMON31 from a mini prep 0.5 ug was digested with EcoRI 1 unit, 1 hour, 37 Plasmid pMON53 0.5 ug from a mini prep prepared from dam cells was digested with ClaI, and recircularized in dilute solution as described above.

Following ligation T4 DNA ligase, 2 units , transformation of DNA 0.5 ug of pMON64 was digested with ClaI 1 unit, 1 hour, 37 Plasmid pNW31C 8,29C Thomashow et al, 1980 was obtained from Dr. S. Gelvin of Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. This plasmid carries the pTiA6 7.5 kb Bam 8 fragment. The Bam 8 fragment was purified from 50 ug of BamHI digested pNW31C 8,29C using NA 45 membrane as described in previous examples. The purified 7.5 kb Bam 8 fragment 1.0 ug was mixed with 0.5 ug of pBR327 vector DNA which had been previously digested with both BamHI 2 units and 0.2 units of calf alkaline phosphatase CAP for 1 hour at 37 Twenty five ug of pMON90 DNA were digested with BglII 25 units, 2 hours, 37 Twenty ug of plasmid pMON109 described in Example 3 were digested with EcoRI and BamHI 20 units each, 2 hours, 37 Twenty ug of pMON113 DNA described in Example 4 were digested with PvuI and EcoRI 2 units each, 2 hr, 37 A culture of Plasmid pMON75 described in detail in a separate application entitled Chimeric Genes Suitable for Expression in Plant Cells, previously cited contains a chimeric NOS NPT II NOS gene. This plasmid and pMON128, described below may be digested by EcoRI and a 1.5 kb fragment may be purified which contains the NOS NPT II NOS gene. Plasmid pMON120 was digested with EcoRI and treated with calf alkaline phosphatase. After phenol deproteinization and ethanol precipitation, the EcoRI cleaved pMON120 linear DNA was mixed with 0.5 ug of the 1.5 kb EcoRI chimeric gene fragment from pMON75 or 76. The mixture was treated with 2 units of T4 DNA ligase for 1 hour at 22 Plasmid pMON128 described in Example 6 was transferred to a chloramphenicol resistant A separate type of co integrate plasmid for use in control experiments was prepared by inserting pMON120 into A. tumefaciens cells, and selecting for cells with co integrate plasmids using spectinomycin and streptomycin, as described above. Like pMON120, these plasmids do not contain the chimeric NOS NPT II NOS gene. The following solutions were used by the Applicants Mitchell petunia plants were grown in growth chambers with two or three banks of fluorescent lamps and two banks of incandescent bulbs about 5,000 lux . The temperature was maintained at a constant 21 The digestion mixture was sieved through a 68, 74, or 88 um screen to remove large debris and leaf material. The filtrate was spun at 70 100 g for five minutes to pellet the protoplasts. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet was gently resuspended in float rinse solution. This suspension was poured into babcock bottles. The bottles were filled to 2 or 3 cm above the base of the neck. 1 ml of growth medium MS9 was carefully layered on top of the float rinse. The Babcock bottles were balanced and centrifuged at 500 to 1000 rpm for 10 to 20 minutes. The protoplasts formed a compact band in the neck at the interface. The band was removed with a pipette, taking care not to pick up any excess float rinse. The protoplasts were diluted into MS9. At this point, the protoplasts were washed with MS9 or diluted for plating without washing. Protoplasts were suspended in MS9 medium at 5 x 10⁴ per ml, and plated into T 75 flasks, at 6 ml per flask. Flasks were incubated on a level surface with dim, indirect light or in the dark at 26 28 On day 5 following protoplast isolation, five to seven day old tobacco suspension cultures TXD cells were diluted if necessary with MS2C medium to the point where 1 ml would spread easily over the surface of agar medium in a 100 x 15 mm petri plate this is a 10 to 15 suspension w v . The agar medium was obtained by mixing 0.8 agar with MS ES medium, autoclaving the mixture, and cooling the mixture until it solidifies in the plate. One ml of the TXD suspension was spread over 25 ml of feeder plate medium. An 8.5 cm disc of Whatman 1 filter paper was laid over the TXD feeder cells and smoothed out. A 7 cm disc of the same paper was placed in the center of the larger one. Separately, aliquots of a culture of The bacteria were added to the flasks to a density of 10⁸ cells ml. 0.5 ml of the cell mixture was spread in a thin layer on the surface of the 7 cm filter paper disc. The plates were wrapped in parafilm or plastic bags and incubated under direct fluorescent lighting, no more than five plates in a stack. Within seven days, colonies were discernable. Within 14 days, the 7 cm discs, with colonies adhering to them, were transferred to new MSO agar medium without feeder cells containing 500 ug ml carbenicillin, as well as 50 ug ml of kanamycin sulfate Sigma, St. Louis, MO . Within two weeks, vigorously growing green colonies could be observed on the plates which contained plant cells that had been co cultured with Both sets of transformed cells and a third set of cells which had been transformed in the same manner by a chimeric gene coding for the enzyme NPT type I were assayed for resistance to kanamycin. The results are indicated in Figure 11. The transformed kanamycin resistant colonies described in Example 10 contained both tumorous and non tumorous cells, as described in Figure 9 and the related text. The following procedure was used to isolate non tumorous transformed cells from tumorous transformed cells, and to regenerate differentiated plant tissue from the non tumorous cells. Colonies were grown on MS104 agar medium containing 30 ug ml kanamycin sulfate and 500 ug ml carbenicillin until they reached about 1 cm in diameter. Predominantly tumorous colonies appear a somewhat paler shade of green and are more loosely organized than predominantly non tumorous colonies were removed from the MS104 medium by tweezers and placed upon MS11 medium containing 30 ug ml kanamycin and 500 ug ml carbenicillin. As the colonies continued to grow, colonies that appeared pale green and loosely organized were removed and discarded. MS11 medium contains zeatin, a phytohormone which induces shooting formation in non tumorous colonies. Several shoots were eventually observed sprouting from kanamycin resistant colonies. These shoots may be grown to a desired size, and cut off by a sharp blade, and inserted into agar medium without phytohormones, such as MSO, where it may generate roots. If desired, the medium may be supplemented by napthalene acetic acid to induce rooting. The plants may be grown to a desired size in the agar medium, and then transferred into soil. If properly cultivated, such plants will grow to maturity and generate seed. The acquired trait will be inherited by progeny according to classic Mendelian genetics. A. Bale et al,
