# Method for welding together two parts.

## Abstract
At high energy or EB welding of two parts the energy bundle is directed into the boundary or slit of the adjacent sides of these parts. The danger can exist that elements, e.g. a rubber seal 4, laying behind this boundary can be demaged by the high energy bundle. The invention obviates the indicated disadvantage by the following measure Before welding a protecting means 6 preferably a steel wire, is arranged in a groove 9 at the end of the boundary or slit 10 of both parts 1, 2 . The result will be such that the energy beam 8 when finishing the welding and thereby reaching the end part of the slit 10 can ultimately only penetrate into the wire 6 . Damaging an element 4. e.g. a seal made of rubber, is therefore prevented.
