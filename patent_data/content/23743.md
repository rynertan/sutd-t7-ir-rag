# Gas discharge laser.

## Abstract
In a gas discharge laser comprising a cylindrical glass discharge vessel 1 of which at least one end is sealed by means of a metal cap 2 which supports at its centre a reflector body 7 and to which a metal exhaust tube 11 is connected eccentrically, at least a major portion of the cap 2 has the shape of a truncated cone and the metal exhaust tube 11 is connected to the conical surface 13 in order to give the generated laser beam good direction stability.
