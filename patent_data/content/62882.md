## Description
DIRECTIONAL FLEXIBILIZATION OF EXPANDED THERMOPLASTIC FOAM SHEET FOR LOW TEMPERATE INSULATIONBackground of the Invention Rigid closed cell thermoplastic foams have been used extensively as thermal insulating materials because of light weight, good compressive strength and high insulating values. However, their rigidity and inelasticity are adverse factors for application to curved surfaces such as pipe lines and cylindrical or spherical tanks. Cutting pieces to fit or custom molding incur added fabrication problems and costs.Yet, if such foams are forceably applied to a curved surface, the closed cell structure is often cracked or broken resulting in loss of insulation value. Alternately, Nakamura U.S. Patent 3,159,700 describes a process for directional flexibilization of rigid plastic foam sheets by partial compression or crushing an expanded foam sheet in a direction generally normal to that of desired flexibility. The process is designed to introduce wrinkles into the cell wall of the plastic foam without rupturing the foam cells or causing significant loss of compressive strength in other directions. By repeating the process in a direction substantially at right angles to the first, two directional flexibilization can be achieved giving a foam product which can assume to a limited degree a compound curvature. Such properties are particularly valuable for rigid foam sheet to be used for low temperature insulation of pipelines, tanks, and other large vessels for the transportation and storage of low temperature fluids.Furthermore, such flexibilized pieces or sheets of expanded foam are readily assembled by the spiral generation techniques of Wright U.S. Patent 3,206,899 and Smith U.S. Patent 4,017,346. However, insulating requirements for the transportation and storage of liquid petroleum gas LPG and cryogenic fluids such as liquid nitrogen demand even higher long term resistance to water vapor transmission while retaining compressive strength adequate for field application and use. Cell wall cracking and rupture must be reduced to a minimum. Accordingly, the present invention has for its objects providing a synthetic resin foam which 1 can be easily applied to a curved surface and then heated to secure the bent shape 2 has improved flexural workability and resistance to cracking, breaking or tearing 3 maintains effective, long term com pressive strength and insulating properties necessary for low temperature storage and transport of liquefied natural gas and cryogenic fluids and 4 has high creep resistance and lasting crack resistance in biaxial directions essential to tolerate heavy loads under cryogenic storage conditions.Summary of the Invention It has now been discovered that flexibilized, rigid plastic foam sheets with improved elongation and water vapor barrier properties particularly desirable for low temperature and cryogenic insulation can be prepared by mechanical compression of certain expanded, closed cell foams having carefully selected structural and physical properties including age after expansion. More specifically the invention is an improved process for the flexibilization of a rigid, substantially closed cell plastic foam sheet having a generally rectangular shape defined by the three dimensional rectangular coordinates X length , Y thickness and Z width and the YZ, XZ and XY planes normal thereto by partial crushing the foam sheet in a direction normal to that of desired flexibilization.The improvement is further characterized by A selecting a freshly extruded foam sheet having 1 a bulk density of 20 100 kg m31 2 an anisotropic cell structure oriented in the Y axial direction with an average y cell size of 0.05 to 1.00 mm, and 3 a Y axial compressive strength of at least 1.8 kg cm2 B compressing said foam sheet within 0.25 to 240 hours of expansion in a short confined compression zone to form a directionally flexibilized foam and thereafter C recovering a directionally flexibilized foam having 1 anisotropically wrinked cell wall structure with wrinkles oriented in the direction of flexibilization 2 average cell sizes x, y and z measured in the axial directions X, Y and Z satisifying the following conditions y 0.05 1.0 mm, and y x and y z 1.05 3 a higher elongation at rupture in the direction of flexibilization and 4 a Y axial water vapor permeability of not more than 1.5 g m2.hr by the water method of ASTM C 355.The resulting flexibilized foam has improved flexural workability and crack resistance particularly desirable for low temperature insulation. Indeed with a substantially closed cell polystyrene resin foam having a bulk density of about 20 to 60 kg m3, flexibilized foam with a Y axial water permeability of less than 1.0 g m2.hr by the water method of ASTM C 355 can be obtained which is stable and effective for long term insulation of cryogenic storage tanks.Detailed Description of the Invention Referring to the drawings, Figures 1A, B, C and 2A, B, C are photomicrographs magnification 50x of the one and two directionally flexibilized foam of preferred Examples 123 and 223 of the present invention showing the closed cell structure as view in the X , Yand Z axial directions defined in Figure 3. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the flexibilized foams of this invention are characterized by an anisotropic cell wall structure in which the wrinkles in the cell wall are directionally oriented. Thus for the one dimensionally flexibilized foam of Figure 1, wrinkles in the cell wall observed in the X axial direction Figure 1A are significantly fewer than those observed in the Y and Z axial directions Figures 1B and 1C . For the two dimensionally flexibilized foam, the cell walls are generally less wrinkled in the X axial andZ axial directions Figures 2A and 2C than in theY axial direction Figure 2B . Because of the small size and polyhedral shape of the foam cells, it is difficult to express thedistribution and location of such wrinkles accurately in terms of cell structure. For simplicity, such distribution is parametrically observed and described in terms of the three dimensional coordinate system of Figure 3. For a typical sheet of extruded thermoplastic foam, the coordinates dimensions X, Y andZ correspond to the length in the machine or extrusion direction, thickness and width of the foam sheet, respectively. The anisotropic wrinkles in combination with the properties of the formulated resin forming the cell walls membranes, the cell size and shape, and the foam density are important parameters of the flexibilized foam. Also such physical properties as axial elongation at rupture and water vapor permeability provide fairly accurate indication of the type, location and distribution of the anisotropic wrinkles.Synthetic Resin Foams The present invention is greatly influenced by the properties of the initial expanded foam sheet or planks. Thus the synthetic resin foams used herein must be of substantially closed cell structure and include foams expanded by extrusion as well as those molded from expandable beads. However, most preferable are extrusion expanded foam boards of substantially rigid, closed cell structure. Also important is their density, cell size, compression strength, and thermal resistance which in turn depend on the synthetic resin polymers used in making the initial foams. Suitable are synthetic resins mainly composed of styrene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, methyl methacrylate or nylon including copolymers thereof and physical blends of these resins. Preferable for the present invention are resins containing as a major component styrene or a styrenic monomer such as a methyl styrene and o , m , p vinyltoluene and chlorostyrene.Also usable are copolymers of styrene or styrenic monomers and other monomers copolymerizable therewith such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, methy methacrylate, maleic anhydride, acrylamide, vinylpyridine, acrylic acid, and methacrylic acid. However, more preferably for the present invention are polystyrene resins consisting essentially of only polymerized styrene and, most preferable polystyrene resins containing 0.3 percent by weight or less of residual styrene monomer and 0.5 to 1.5 percent by weight of styrene oligomers, primarily dimer and trimer.Polystyrene resins containing such quantities of styrene monomer and styrene trimer provide expanded foams having particularly uniform distribution of density and cell size as well as improved resistance to repeated compression. Foams from such polystyrene resins are especially well suited for one and two directional flexibilization. To improve toughness, rubber may be blended with such monomers before polymerization or added to the system after polymerization. Further, the foregoing resins may be blended with other polymers so long as the desirable properties of the styrene resins are not adversely affected.Selection of Foam Sheets To achieve the desired flexibilization and properties essential for low temperature insulation requires careful selection of the initial foam sheets and control of several important properties prior to flexibilization. Thus it has been found essential for the present invention that the synthetic resin foam have 1 a bulk density of about 20 to 100 kg m3, and preferably about 20 to 60 kg m3 for one directional flexibilization 2 a Y direction cell size of about 0.05 1.0 mm, and 3 a Y axial compressive strength of at least 1.8 kg cm2. To examine the interrelation of foam density kg m3 and cell size mm , especially Y axial cell size y, a group of flexibilized foams having varied foam densities and Y axial cell sizes were evaluated for Y axial compressive strength as a parameter of creep resistance, X axial and Z axial tensile strengths as parameters of breakage or rupture resistance of the foams in use, variations in the X axial and Z axial tensile strengths as parameters of the uniformity of performance or quality, and Y axial thermal conductivity. Typical results given below in Tables 1 and 2 and based on an overall evaluation from a series of tests indicate that foams of the present invention must have a bulk density of about 20 to 100 kg m3, average y cell size of 0.05 to 1.0 mm and average cell size ratios y x and y z 1.05. More preferably the foams must be constructed substantially of cells having the major axis thereof more definitely disposed along theY axis with the axial average cell axial size ratios y x and y z are 1.10 to 4.0. If the average axial cell size ratios yXx and y z exceeds 4, the balance between the dimensional stability, linear expansion coefficient and the tensile strength will be lost. Comtression Flexibilization Synthetic resin foams having the required bulk density and anisotropic cell structure and size can be flexibilized by compression in one or two axial directions as described in Nakamura U.S. 3,159,700 to provide the high water vapor barrier and other properties desired for low temperature and cryogenic insulation.However, carefully controlled conditions are required. Figures 4 and 5 show schematic diagrams of suitable compression equipment of flexibilizers. In the flexibilizer of Figure 4, there are provided infeed rollers 1, 2 and outfeed rollers 3, 4 spaced longitudinally from each other. The flexibilizer shown in Figure 5 is provided with infeed belts 9, 10 and outfeed belts 11, 12 which are also spaced longitudinally from each other. These paired rollers or belts hold the expanded foam securely. The reference numerals 5, 6 inFigure 5 and the reference numerals 13, 14 in Figure 4 indicate foam holding pressure means which should be controlled accurately because the foam will undergo a significant thicknesswise compression if the pressure is too strong. In operation the infeed rollers or belts are driven somewhat faster than the second outfeed pair so that the foam is compressed in the longitudinal direction in the gap between the infeed and outfeed rollers or belts. According to the present invention, the foam is normally compressed first in the longitudinal X axial direction. Then if desired, the one directionally flexibilized sheet can be subjected to compression in another direction at right angle to the longitudinal direction, namely, in the lateral Z axial direction to provide a more flexible sheet which can assume a compound curvature. As noted, the flexibilization conditions must be carefully selected and controlled. Particularly important are a selection of expanded foam plans having uniform quality throughout the sheet b minimum aging of the foam planks after expansion c short compression zone and d stepwise compression for flexibilized foams with larger elongation. A uniform quality for the initial expanded foam sheet is required since the foams are mechanically compressed for flexibilization one direction at axis by axis a time, e.g., X axially first and then Z axially, while being held squeezedly Y axially. Thus it is necessary that the foams have minimum variation in mechanical properties, especially compressive strength throughout the sheet. The importance of minimum foam aging after extrusion or expansion and before flexibilization is shown in Figures 7 and 8. As described further inExample 3, foam samples aged for varying length of time before flexibilization in the apparatus of Figure 5 were evaluated for water vapor barrier and foam elongation properties particularly important in the use of the foam for low temperature and cryogenic insulation.These results indicate that the foam should be flexibilized while fresh shortly after initial extrusion, i.e., within 10 days 240 hrs and preferably 3 days 72 hrs or less. Indeed, in line flexibilization shortly after foam extrusion, e.g., after about 0.1 hour to allow for cooling, may be advantageous. By control of the compression conditions, foam sheets ranging from 10 mm to 300 mm in thickness have been flexibilized without significant loss inY axial compressive strength, water vapor barrier properties and other desired properties. For sheets thicker than about 35 mm the flexibilizer of Figure 5 is preferred. Elongation of foam processed with this flexibilizer can be controlled by the spacing between the infeed and outfeed belts. For best results, the compression distance D should be about 300 mm at the maximum, and preferably 200 mm or less, with a compression duration of at least one second. Line speeds of 5 to 40 m min can be achieved with good results. For thicker insulation, flexibilized sheets can be laminated in desired configurations using a small amount of an adhesive applied sporadically to minimize the effect of the adhesive on the properties of the laminated foams. Flexibilized Foam for Low Temperature Insulation Flexibilization essential herein is achieved by the controlled introduction of anisotropically oriented wrinkles in the foam cell walls in a manner that does not unduly weaken the integrity of the foam or crack the cell walls and cause loss of thermal insulation and water vapor barrier properties. Since the foam cells are very small and have polyhedral shapes, it is very difficult to define the location of such wrinkles accurately in terms of cell shape and structure. However, the Y axial water vapor permeability of the flexibilized foam indicates cracking or breakage of the cell walls. Also the percentage elongation at rupture in the three axial directions is a measurable parameter of the extensibility, location and distribution of the wrinkles. Typical results are given in theExamples, and particularly Tables 3 and 4. From Tables 3 and 4, it will be obvious that the foams contemplated by the present invention must have a Y axial water vapor permeability Py equal to or smaller than 1.5 g m2 . hr to prevent or minimize deteriora tion in thermal insulating properties over long use.More preferably, the water vapor permeability should be 1.0 g m2 hr or less. In addition to the Y axial water vapor permeability of the flexibilized foams, the elongations at rupture in the three axial directions are useful parameters of extensibility, location and distribution of wrinkles and suitability for applications involving such severe conditions as encountered in liquid nitrogen storage tanks. Evaluation of the variations in theX axial and Z axial elongations at rupture shows the uniformity of the extensibility throughout the foam while the change in Y axial thermal conductivity with time reflects loss of thermal insulating properties from moisture absorption after prolonged use underY axial loads. Also, cryogenic tests at about 1600C and 1960C show the crack resistance of the foam when used as thermal insulation for liquefied natural gas and nitrogen tanks. The preferred polystyrene foams exhibit excellent properties as cryogenic insulation even without cladding reinforcement. Their bendability and thermoformability are particularly advantageous for field construction. To minimize multi axial strains of the foams after application or to improve thermal properties, two or more such foams may be bonded to form foam logs with biaxial extensibility Also, they may be clad with metal foils or they may be combined with synthetic resin films having high gas barrier properties. The present invention also provides improved synthetic resin foams which can be applied to small diameter pipes by adjusting the extensibility of the foams in the bending direction in accordance with the pipe outside diameter and the foam thickness. Other tests with 114 mm outside diameter pipes confirmed the applicability of the one and two dimensionally flexibilized foam sheet to a variety of curved surfaces including pipes and cylindrical and spherical tanks regardless of curvature. Such tests are representative of the bendability, applicability to curved surfaces, cryogenic insulating properties, and other characteristics required for practical use of such foams. Indeed, the flexibilized foams of the present invention are significantly improved over prior art foam products. They are becoming increasingly important as thermal insulation for transportation and storage of LNG, for cold storage of foods, and for exterior walls of buildings. These foams provide effective thermal insulation that can be applied easily to such structures in the field. The present invention will be further illustrated by the following preferred and reference examples using the procedures and tests described below. Unless otherise specified, all parts and percentages are by weight. Polystyrene Resins The polystyrene resins used for the extruded foam sheets were selected from commercial stock after analysis for residual volatiles primarily styrene and ethylbenzene and oligomers styrene dimer and trimer by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector.For the oligomers, the resin is dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone, the polymer precipitated with methanol, and the supernatant liquid analyzed. These resins had an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.83 measured in toluene solution at 300C. Extruded Foam Sheets The polymers were expanded into a rigid, substantially closed cell foam with an extrusion foaming system composed of a screw extruder, blowing agent blending feeder, cooler and board forming die. More specifically, a mechanical blend of 100 parts of the polystyrene resin, 2 parts of a flame retardant and 0.03 to 0.1 part of a nucleator is continuously fed into the extruder with 12 to 17 parts of a 50 50 mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane methyl chloride as a blowing agent. The thermoplastic mixture is kneaded under pressure, cooled to an extrusion temperature of about 900 to 1180C and then extruded through a die and expanded into a foam.The extrusion conditions were controlled so that the foam was about 110 mm x 350 mm in cross section and the axial cell size ratios Y X and were about 1.1 to 1.25 and 1.1 to 1.17, respectively. The Y axial cell size and bulk density D were varied in the range of 0.07 to 1.6 mm and about 21.5 to 77 kg m3, respectively. Foams lighter than about 21 kg m3 were subjected to secondary expansion by exposure to steam at 1000C for 2 to 6 minutes. The resultant foams have a bulk density of about 15.5 to 20 kg m3. Analysis showed essentially no loss of residual volatiles or oligomers in the extrusion process. Directional Flexibilization Skins were removed from the freshly extruded foams to obtain skinless foam boards about 100 mm x 300 mm in cross section and 2,000 4,000 mm in length.These foam planks were mechanically compressed for flexibilization in the of X axial direction and then for two directional flexibility in the Z axial direction using the equipment shown in Figure 5.

Three 20 mm x 100 mm x 1750 mm specimens were prepared from a flexibilized foam board and wound around a stainless steel pipe 36 and their opposite end faces YZ faces were butt welded together as shown at o0, 41 and 42 in Figure 10. The the pipe specimens were quickly immersed in a cryostat filled with liquid nitrogen so that all specimens were well under the liquid surface. After being immersed for 5 hours, they were taken out of the cryostat and left at a room temperature for 5 hours. After 4 cycles of such treatment, the three specimens were carefully observed for any visual changes including cracks, fractures or ruptures. Good ... No visible fractures or cracks Unacceptable ... cannot wind without fracturing B. In another test, flexibilized foam specimens 50 mm thick, 170 270 mm wide and 300 mm long were smoothed by machining the top and bottom surfaces.After marking the X and Z axes on the edges, each piece was covered top and bottom with 12 mm thick plywood conforming to Japanese Agricultural Standard using a commercial cryogenic polyurethane adhesive SumitacEA90177 produced by Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd., Japan to the joint surfaces. The adhesive was cured by placing the test panel under pressure of 0.5 kg cm2 for 24 hours at 230C. 1. Cryogenic Test at 1600C Each cryogenic test panel 34 is placed in a liquid nitrogen cooled cryostat box having an internal temperature controlled to 1600C i 50C by controlled addition, gasification and diffusion of liquid nitrogen.After 5 hours, the test panel is quickly removed and left at room temperatures for about 1 hour. This process is repeated 4 cycles. After the last cycle, the test panel is visually checked for cracks in the four exposed faces of the foam specimen. Then one hour after removal from the cryostat, the plywood covers are removed with a slicer. Then a 10 mm thick slice of the foam is cut from the top surface and a mixture of a surfactant and colorant in water is applied to the surfaces of the cut foam to show any cracks formed therein. 2. Cryogenic Test at 1960C For this test, a cryogenic box partially filled with a liquid nitrogen is used. The plywood faced test panels are submerged in the liquid nitrogen and placed on triangular steel supports fixed to the bottom of the box. A steel weight precooled in liquid nitrogen is placed on the test panel top, and the panel held immersed for 30 minutes. Then the test panel is taken out and left at room temperature for one hour under forced ventilation.

Bendability Three pieces of flexibilized foam 200 mm wide, 500 mm long and 25, 37.5 and 75 mm thick are bent to the curvature of a steel pipe 54 about 114 mm in outside diameter by applying a bending stress Y axially thereto with its Z axis disposed in parallel with the axis of the pipe 54, as shown in Figure 11. The specimen is bent until it is brought into close contact with the outer peripheral surface of the pipe over an area exceeding the outer surface area of a semicylindrical half section of the pipe the section above the center line A A shown in Figure 11 .Rating ObservationGood Bends easily without cracksPassable Bends with careful attentionUnacceptable Breaks B.

Markings are put on the cut edge of the pipe 54 diameterically oppositely along the center line A A shown in Figure 12. The bent specimen 56 is then totally covered with a galvanized, 0.3 mm thick sheet iron 55 and the opposite side ends of the foam specimen held with tensioning bands 57. Then the covered specimen 56 is placed in a hot air oven with the tensioning bands 57 down and heated at 850C for 45 minutes. After being removed from the oven, the specimen is cooled at room temperature for two hours.Then, the galvanized cover 55 is removed and the gaps 58 and 59 from the outer ends of the foregoing markings to the intersections of the center line A A and the inner wall of the specimen 56 are measured and rated as follows Good Average gap 5 mmPassable Average gap 5 10 mmUnacceptable Average gap 10 mm C. Thermal Insulation Test Pieces of flexibilized foam cut to a 37.5 mm x 200 mm x 500 mm size are thermoformed as above in two layers and then cutZ axially to provide inner and outer semicylindrical thermal insulation covers for a 114 mm o.d. pipe. The test cover pieces are then fit to a lla mm o.d. stainless steel pipe about 800 mm long with flanges at each end and secured with a cryogenic polyurethane adhesive.The joints of the outer covers are staggered from those of the inner cover. The entire section is then coated with a 2.5 mm thick waterproof layer of polyurethane mastic. After 4 days aging, the covered pipe is connected to a cryogenic test line and filled with liquid nitrogen.The interior of the stainless steel pipe is maintained at 1960C for 6 hours. Thereafter, the liquid nitrogen is discharged and the covered pipe left for 12 hours at 230C and 80 R.H.

The results are evaluated as follows Good No visible surface change Passable Brief spots of moisture condensation Unacceptable Icing or extensive condensation Immediately after the above tests, the waterproof coating and foam insulation layers are carefully removed and visually examined for cracks using a colorant solution if necessary. Good No visible damage or cracks Passable Fine cracks Unacceptable Ruptures or large cracksExample 1 One Direction Flexibilization Using a commercial polystyrene resin containing 0.20 weight percent residual volatiles including styrene monomer and 0.87 weight percent oligomers including styrene trimer herein PS Resin A , a variety of foam planks were prepared for one directional flexibilization. The extrusion conditions were controlled to give a foam sheet about 110 mm x 350 mm in cross section with a bulk density of about 21.5 to 60 kg m3. Skins were removed from each of the foams and the resulting foam board was cut into three smaller planks each 100 mm square and 4,000 mm long. Preferred Examples 101 112 Reference Examples R101 107 After aging one day, the foam planks were flexibilized by compression in the machine direction X axis using the equipment of Fig. 5 and the typical conditions described in the procedures above. The flexibilized foam planks of the preferred Examples 101 112 were evaluated for density, Y axial cell sizes, cell shapes represented by y x and y z, compression strengths Y axial and Z axial , X axial tensile strengths and elongation at rupture with the results shown in Table 1. In these examples, the axial cell size ratios y z were in the range of 1.00 to 1.25. For comparison other foams expanded from PSResin A but lacking in desired foam characteristics were flexibilized in a similar manner with results shown in Table 1 as Reference Examples.

Those foams lighter than about 21 kg m3 are subjected to secondary expansion by exposing them to steam at 1000C for 2 to 6 minutes resulting in a bulk density of about 15.5 to 20 kg m3.

Example 3 Flexibilization Time In normal practice, rigid thermoplastic foam sheets are aged for at least several weeks before use to stabilize the foam structure. During the development of the flexibilized foam for cryogenic insulation, it was discovered that the age of the extruded foam at the time of compression flexibilization profoundly influenced the resulting foam properties. Using foam sheet extruded from polystyrene resin A and cut to standard 25 mm and 100 mm thick pieces, the effect of flexibilization time was examined for both one and two direction flexibilization.Typical results are shown graphically in Figures 7 and 8 with the A series being one directional X axial flexibilization and the B series being two directional X axial, then Z axial flexibilization. A. One Directional Flexibilization Figure 7A shows the relation between X axial elongation at rupture Ex of the flexibilized foams and the aging period of the initial foam sheet after extrusion, while Figure 8A shows the relation between water vapor permeability and the aging period before flexibilization. It is evident that to obtain the improved elongation and water vapor barrier properties intended by the present invention, it is necessary that the aging period for the foams prior to compression flexibilization be not more than 10 days 240 hrs and more preferably, 3 days 72 hrs or less. B. Two Directional Flexibilization Figure 7B shows a relation between the X axial percentage elongation at rupture Ex of two directionally flexibilized foams and the aging time of the extruded foam planks. Note that aging affects the X axial andZ axial percentage elongations at rupture substantially equally. The initial fresh foam planks had a density of about 27 kg m3, thickness of about 100 mm, and X, Yand Z axial average cell sizes of about 0.55 mm, 0.72 mm and 0.58 mm, respectively. After being cut to a thickness of 25 mm, the foams were subjected to one cycle of 37 percent compression X axially first and then Z axially at varied aging times. The Z axial percentage elongations at rupture Ez ranges from about 80 to 90 percent of the X axial percentage elongation at rupture Ex.In Fig. 7B, the axial percentage elongations at rupture are representatively given as theX axial percent elongation at rupture Ex. Fig. 8B shows a relationship between the water vapor permeability Py of flexibilized foams and the aging period of the material foams after expansion thereof. The foam planks have the same density and axial average cell sizes as those above. Test pieces about 25 mm thick were cut and subjected to 20 37 percent compression applied one to three times in each direction. The resulting foams had an X axial percentage elongation at rupture Ez of about 20 percent and Z axial percentage elongation at rupture Ez of about 16 percent. Again it is clear that to obtain desired properties, the foam should be flexibilized while fresh, i.e., within 10 days or more preferably 3 days of extrusion and or expansion. This applies especially to relatively thin foams as represented by the 25 mm thick samples used in the preceding experiments. The optimum time within the range of about 0.25 240 hours will, of course, depend on the specific properties of the initial foam and the desired results. Example 4 Water Vapor Permeability Critical for low temperature insulation is the ability of the foam to be an effective barrier to the transfer of water vapor from the outer to inner surface of the insulation. A. One Directionally Flexibilized Foam Preferred Examples 121 132 Reference Examples R121 126 Using the same equipment and methods, flexibilizable foam planks were expanded from PS Resin A under controlled conditions so that the resultant foams had densities D in the range of about 22.5 to 51 kg m3,Y axial cell sizes y in the range of about 0.07 to 1.0 mm and axial cell size ratios y x and y z of about 1.35 to 2 and about 1.1 1.3, respectively. Then the resultant foam planks were cut to 100 mm square and 4,000 mm long and after aging for one day were compressed X axially.Typical properties including water vapor permeability for these flexibilized foams are given in Table 3.

Figures 1A, B and C are photomicrographs magnification 50x of the polystyrene foam of the preferred example 123 showing closed cells distributed as viewed in the X , Y and Z directions shown in Fig.3. Note that the flexibilized foams of the present invention have a unique structural anisotropy in which wrinkles in the cell walls observed in the YZ plane Fig. 1A are significantly fewer than those observed in the XZ and XY planes Fig. 1B and 1C . Since the foam cells are very small and have polyhedral shapes, it is very difficult to express the distribution and locations of such wrinkles accurately. However, con vsidering the relations between Ex, E and the Y axial water vapor permeability Py with reference to Fig. 1, these relationships provide fairly accurate structural parameters of the wrinkles including their type, location and distribution.

These foam planks were compressed for flexibilization X axially first and then Z axially by using the equipment as shown in Fig. 5. Then the foam densities D and other properties including the Y axial water permeability Py of the thus biaxially flexibilized foams are measured. Also, the changes in Y axial thermal conductivity as well as the X axial and Z axial cryogenic resistance at l600C and 1960C are observed.Typical results are shown in Table 4.

For applications involving such severe conditions as encountered in liquid nitrogen gas tanks and for ensuring improved he at insulating properties over a longer period, the preferred foams of the present invention must also satisfy the following conditions Ez 52 Ez 8.3 Ex Ey B 1.8, 8.3 h Ex Ey A 1.8 Ex Ez 12 Ey where 40 L Ex L 12 and 40 Ez 12 and Py 1.0 Fig. 2A, B and C are photomicrographs magnification 50x of the flexibilized polystyrene foam ofPreferred Example 223 showing the closed cells viewed in the X, Y and Z directions shown in Fig. 3.Note that the foam is characterized by structurally anisotropic cell walls. Those visible in the YZ and XV planes shown in Fig. 2A and 2C are generally wavy only in one direction, namely in the Z axial and X axial directions respectively, but not in the Y axial direction. Such anisotropically distributed cell wall wrinkles in combination with the foam density as well as with the sizes and shapes of cells are important structural parameters of the foams of the present invention, in view of the aforementioned relationship between Ex and Ez, the ratios of axial percentage elongations at rupture Ex Ey, Ez Ey and Y axial water vapor permeability that represent the distribution and directions of such wrinkles.Example 5 Cryogenic Insulation A. One Directionally Flexibilized Foam Surprisingly, an experiment has revealed that when wound around a steel drum and heated at about 800C foams having the desired improved elongation properties and water vapor barrier properties can be shaped to the drum curvature and can be fixed to that shape. Still the winding requires no large force and entails only a minimum reduction in the thermal insulating properties. Table 5 shows the results of experiments on still another group of the preferred examples of the present invention and several reference foams. Since these evaluation items are substantially representative of the bendability, applicability to curved surfaces, adhesion workability, cryogenic insulating properties and other characteristics practically required to such foams, Table 5 does give overall evaluation for practical applicabilities of such foams. Further, to minimize multi axial strains of the foams after application or to improve the thermal insulating properties effectively, two or more such foams may be bonded so that the resultant foam logs show biaxial extensibility or they may be clad with metal foils or they may be combined with synthetic resin films having high gas barrier properties.

The synthetic resin foams of the present invention having larger extensibility in two axial directions show excellent bendability, thermoformability and applicability to pipes having small diameters.They can be easily applied to such small diameter pipes and can be easily thermoformed to their bent shapes.Further, because of substantial freedom from crack formation in bending operation or under cryogenic conditions, the synthetic resin foams according to the present invention can provide excellent cryogenic thermal insulating materials free from moisture condensation even at 1960C which are generally applicable to pipes, cylindrical and spherical tanks. Although the reference foams compressed onlyX axially or Z axially have satisfiable bendability and thermoformability, they are not entirety satisfactory as cryogenic thermal insulation because they may break under cryogenic conditions due to cracks spreading circumferentially of the pipe or in other directions.Such cracks form because these foams do not have sufficient extensibility to absorb stresses generated by sudden changes between the room and cryogenic temperatures.Example 6 Thermoplastic Resin Foams The improved flexibilization process is applicable to a variety of thermoplastic resin foams, both extruded and expanded. A. Commercial PS Resin A is a thermally polymerized polystyrene resin having an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.83 dissolved in toluene at 300C and containing 0.20 weight percent residual volatiles including styrene monomer and 0.87 weight percent oligomers including styrene trimer. Blends with other polystyrene resins richer in residual styrene monomer and trimer were flexibilized with typical results shown in Table 7. For such thermally polymerized polystyrene resins, preferred resins for the flexibilized foams are those containing 0.3 weight percent or less of residual volatiles including styrene monomer and 0.5 1.5 weight percent of styrene oligomers including trimer.

Instead of the polystyrene foams used in the foregoing examples, two commercially available polyvinyl chloride foams Klegecell 33 produced byKanegafuchi Chemical Co., Ltd. and Rockecell Board produced by Fuji Kasei Co., Ltd. and a methyl methacrylate resin foam made experimentally by Asahi DowLimited cut to 50 x 600 x 900 mm , 25 x 600 x 900 mm and 50 x 300 x 900 mm , respectively, are compressed under conditions typically given above. The resultant flexibilized foams are tested and evaluated with typical results shown in Table 8.Thus, the present invention is applicable also to foams expanded from polyvinyl chloride resins including blends thereof with inorganic materials, methyl methacrylate and the like resins other than polystyrene, and the resulting flexibilized foams satisfy the requirements of the present invention. C. A batch of prefoamed polystyrene beads 3 having a bulk density of 11.6 kg m is placed in a mold, and steam is heated for about 40 seconds under pressure of 3 kg cm2. The resulting foam was aged at about 70 C for 12 hours. It had a density of 10.9 kg m3 with of 0.33 mm, of 0.31 mm and of 0.32 mm.Three 350 mm cubes are cut out from its central portion by means of an electrically heated wire cutter. One sample was flexibilized X axially by compression to 90 percent of its original volume by applying 40 kg cm2 pressure with a 50 ton press. The compression was repeated continuous six times by relieving the pressure immediately after its application. The compressed foam has the size of 350 x 350 x 262 mm with a density of 14.5 kg m3. The other samples were similarly flexibilized in two and three directions. All were subjected to the standard tests and failed to meet one or more of the desired results contemplated by the present invention. Note also that none had the requisite initial foam density.
