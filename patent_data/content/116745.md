# BURSTER FOR CONTINUOUS FORM STATIONERY

## Abstract
A burster including spaced infeed and outfeed pairs of rollers in fixed spatial relationship with respect to each other which are driven by a system including a variable, limited lost motion connection to the infeed rollers. The connection includes a long lived tooth and stop assembly wherein impacting surfaces of the tooth and the stop members are configured to minimize shear stresses occurring in the tangential direction in favor of readily absorbed radial stresses to thereby provide a long lived apparatus.
