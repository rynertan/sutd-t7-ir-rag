## Description
POLYURETHANE ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to novel adhesive compositions, and is particularly concerned with polyurethane adhesive compositions which are useful as an adhesive for metals, plastics, rubber, etc. Recently, as packaging materials for foodstuffs, etc., there have been developed and put in wide use multi ply composite films consisting of films of plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, polyester and polyvinyl chloride, being laminated to metal foil, such as aluminum foil, in two, three or four layers. For bonding together these plastic films or metal foil, there has been known a method of applying over. it an adhesive composition containing a linear saturated polyester glycol, an epoxy resin having not less than 2 hydroxyl groups, a polyisocyanate compound and an ester of phosphoric acid However, this method suffers from the defects that the resultant bond is not always provided with adequate adhesion strength and is inferior in heat resistance or chemical resistance, such as acid and alkali resistance For example, there is encountered the disadvantage that the composite film fabricated by the method, when heat sterilized by high temperature hot water of not less than 1200C after highly acid food containing free fatty acids is packaged therein, not only shows reduction in adhesion strength between the metal foil and the plastic films but also displays lowered strength as a packaging material and, in extreme cases, develops complete delamination, with the resultant induction of pinholes through the metal foil, reducing the air barrier properties inherent to metals and hence, constituting a serious hindrance to achievement of the object of preserving foodstuffs for a long period of time. The present inventors, after extensive investigation conducted with a specific view to eliminating these defects, found that incorporation of a silane coupling agent in to the said composition can produce adhesive compositions having adhesion strength by far superior to those obtained by the conventionally known processes and thus can yield coating films having outstandingly excellent heat and chemical resistance.

The oxyacids of phosphorus or derivatives thereof as mentioned above may be used alone or as a mixture of not less than two kinds. Among the above compounds, those having not less than one free oxyacid are particularly preferable, and orthophosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid or partial adducts of orthophosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid with epoxy compounds are favorable. The oxyacid of phosphorus or derivative thereof is capable of forming the ionic or covalent bond with metals, and also can react with the epoxy resin and isocyanate group to be described hereinafter, with the result that they play a very important role in enhancing particularly the performance of adhesion toward metals and also in improving the acid and alkali resistance.Their amount to be added is in the range of about 0o01 to 10 weight percent against the total adhesive composition, preferably about 0.05 to 5 weight percent, more preferably about 0.1 to 1 weight percent. As the epoxy resins which are useful in this invention, by way of example, use is made of reaction products between polyhydric phenols, such as bisphenol A and tetrahydroxydiphenylethane, and polyfunctional halohydrins, such as epichlorohydrin, which have a molecular weight of about 320 to 5,000, preferably about 320 to 4,000 and an epoxy equivalent of about 140 to 3,500, preferably 450 to 1000. The amount of the epoxy resin is in the range of about 1 to 50 weight percent, preferably about 5 to 30 weight percent, against the total adhesive composition.

In addition to the silane coupling agent, if necessary, use can be made of additives such as antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, hydrolysis stablizers, antifungal or antibacterial agents, thickening agents, plasticizers, pigments and fillers. Also, known catalysts, additives, etc. can be used for the regulation of the curing reaction. The polyurethane adhesive composition of this invention is obtained by admixing the above mentioned organic polyisocyanate, polyol, oxyacid of phosphorus or derivative thereof, the epoxy resin and the silane coupling agent. The NCO H ratio, i,e,, the number of the NCO group of the organic polyisocyanate the number of the active hydrogen group H of the polyol, the oxyacid of phosphorus or the derivative thereof and the epoxy resin is chosen in the range of about 0.4 to 20. The polyurethane adhesive composition of this invention can be used either as one can type onecomponent or two can type two component adhesive according to the intended object Thus, the one can type adhesive is obtained by reacting a uniformly mixed solution of a polyol, an oxyacid of phosphorus or derivative thereof, an epoxy resin and a silane coupling agent with an organic polyisocyanate in the presence of an excess of isocyanate group.This is a type of causing cure by the reaction with water or moisture in the air In producing the one can type adhesive, it is convenient to carry out the reaction of the isocyanate group NCO with the active hydrogen group H of the polyol and oxyacid of phosphorus or derivative thereof and the epoxy resin in an NCO H ratio of about 1.5 to 20, preferably about 2 to 10. Less than 1.5 of the NCO H ratio results in too much increased viscosity of the resultant composition, and leads in some instance to its gelatin. And, when the NCO H ratio is in excess of 20, there develop deteriorated curing characteristics, and the composition with adequate adhesion strength in some instances cannot be obtained. The reaction is carried out normally at 30O to 100or, whereby the organic metal catalyst, tertiary amine catalyst, etc. if desired, may be added. As another embodiment of this invention, there may be mentioned the so called two can type, which comprises mixing a polyol as the principal component with a curing agent of an organic polyisocyanate immediately before use. The oxyacid of phosphorus or derivative thereof and the silane coupling agent are respectively added to either the polyisocyanate or polyol, but it is favorable to add either of them in advance to the polyol or a mixture thereof with the epoxy resin. In the case of the two can type, the proportion in which the curing agent is mixed with the principal component is such as an NCO H ratio may be about 0.4 to 10, preferably about 0.5 to 2.0. As is the case with the one can type, it is possible in the case of the two can type to use catalysts such as organic metal and tertiary amine catalysts. Normally, the two can type exhibits faster curing rate and better adhesion performance than the one can type, finding wider application. Though the two can type showed a shortened length of pot life, it can be used without difficulty by employing a device which is adapted to automatically deliver a principal component and a curing agent through separate stream lines at the determined weight ratio and only in the minimal weights required for coating application and to mix them immediately before use The adhesive composition of this invention, when it has a viscosity of about 100 to 10,000 cps., preferably about 100 to 5,000 cps., at normal temperature to l400C, preferably normal temperature to 1000C,, can be used as the solvent free type. When the viscosity exceeds the above range, such adhesive composition may also be diluted with an organic solvent, in whichever case it may be used as the one can type or two can type. As the organic solvent, use may be made of any solvent which is inert to the isocyanate group, such as esters being exemplified by ethyl acetate butyl acetate 2 ethoxyethyl acetate, etc., ketones being typified by methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone etc. aromatics being exemplified by toluene, xylene, etc.and ethers being exemplified by tetrahydrofuran, dioxane etc. The procedure specifically prescribed for using the polyurethane adhesive composition of this invention comprises, for example, applying the adhesive composition to the surface of a film by means of a solvent type or solvent free type laminator, joining the mating surfaces either after the solvent is evaporated in the case of the solvent type or directly in the case of the solvent free type, and curing the composition at normal temperature or under heating. Normally, it is favorable to use the adhesive composition in the application amount within the range of about 1.0 to 2.0 g m2 in the case of the solvent free type and about 2.0 to 4.0 g m2 in the case of the solvent type. As compared with the conventional solvent type, a solvent free type of the adhesive composition of this invention permits the saving of energy and does not require solvent recovery facilities, thus enabling the overhead expenses to be reduced down to not more than the half of those for the conventional solvent type. As compared with the conventional solvent free type urethane adhesives, the adhesive composition of this invention exhibits faster curing characteristics and better adhesion performance, and particularly shows excellent adhesion strength, heat resistance, water resistance and chemical resistance when applied to films of plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate, nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride as well as metals such as aluminium, stainless steel, iron, copper and lead On the other hand, a solvent type of the adhesive composition of this invention is superior in adhesion strength, heat and chemical resistance to the conventional solvent type ones. Particularly, the epoxy rings in the resin are opened by an oxyacid of phosphorus or derivative thereof added in small amount, thus yielding coating films having excellent chemical resistance. The polyurethane adhesive composition, when used for example as an adhesive for packaging materials for food, provides the bond showing outstandingly excellent adhesion strength, heat resistance and hot water resistance between metal foil such as aluminum foil and films of plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon and polyethylene terephthalate etc. The packaging materials thus prepared, when they are filled with foods in sealed relation and subjected to high temperature, hot water sterilization treatment at a temperature of not less than l200C, are entirely free from delamination between the metal foil and the plastic film, and are therefore used advantageously as the packaging material which shows improved tolerance to foodstuffs and ensures the prolonged shelf lives of foodstuffs.
