# Semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
This Schottky barrier gate field effect transistor has N type source and drain regions 48, 50 formed in the surface area of a GaAs semi insulation substrate 30 , a channel region 52 formed between the source and drain regions 48, 50 , and a gate electrode 47 formed on this channel region 52 . Particularly, in this Schottky barrier gate field effect transistor, the gate electrode 47 has a first metal portion 46 , which is preferably in Schottky contact with the channel region 52 , and a second metal portion 40 , which stably affixes to the first metal portion 46 . The first and second metal portions 46, 40 are fixed to an insulative portion 44 formed on the channel region 52 .
