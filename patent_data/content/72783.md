# An improvement in expendable containers.

## Abstract
An improvement in expendable dispenser type fluid containers. The expendable container 1 is formed in one integral piece and consists of three portions, viz. one front portion 3 which has comparatively thick walls and therefore is shape resistant, one portion 4 which extends from the first portion and which has comparatively thin walls and therefore is collapsible exhaustible, and a dispensing portion 5 . The expendable container 1 is made from plastics and the properties of the various portions 3, 4, 5 result from the different wall thicknesses of the portions. This is achieved by manufacturing the container in an extrusion operation followed by blow moulding to the desired shape. The dispensing portion is provided with a mechanism designed to dispense fluids in metered quantities and said mechanism may be of a kind known per se.
