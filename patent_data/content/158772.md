# Magnetic brush development device for an electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A developing device comprising a developer receptacle for storing a two component developer composed of carrier particles and toner particles, a magnetic brush mechanism 36 disposed in a front portion within the developer receptacle, a first agitating mechanism 38 disposed in a rear portion within the developer 14 receptacle in a spaced apart relationship to the magnetic brush mechanism 36 , a second agitating mechanism 40 disposed in proxim ity to, and rearwardly or downwardly of, the magnetic brush mechanism, a developer removing member 50 disposed between the magnetic brush mechanism 36 and the first agitating mechanism 38 with its front edge being in contact with, or in proximity to, the surface of the magnetic brush mechanism 36 , and a toner particle supplier 32 for supplying toner particles to the developer receptacle is characterized in that a plurality of cuts 54 spaced in the widthwise direction are formed at least in the front portion of the developer removing member 50 , and a part of the developer held on the surface of the magnetic brush mechanism 36 is removed therefrom by the action of the developer removing member 50 and caused to flow over the upper surface of the developer removing member 50 toward the first agitating mechanism 38 but the remainder of the developer held on the surface of the magnetic brush mechanism 36 moves through the cuts without undergoing the action of the developer removing member and is caused to flow toward the second agitating mechanism 40 .
