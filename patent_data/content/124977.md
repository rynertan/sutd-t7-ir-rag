# Clamp arrangements.

## Abstract
A clamp arrangement for clamping a marginal portion of a board 1 between two opposed substantially flat parallel walls 7a . The mechanism 17 is mounted on the board 1 and is arranged to be capable of expansion in a direction normal to the board 1 . The mechanism 17 comprises an elongate spring strip 19 extending in the direction of its length along the marginal portion, and having corrugations transverse to its length. An elongate cam 23 overlies the spring strip, the cam having a plurality of cam surfaces 23a along its length spaced apart at the same pitch as the spring strip corrugations. Clamping is obtained by sliding the cam 23 relative to the spring strip 19 bringing the cam surfaces 23a into contact with the corrugations, thus causing expen sion of the mechanism and subsequent pressure on the two opposed walls 7a due to compression of the spring corruga tions.
