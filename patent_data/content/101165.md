# Developer for use in forming a polyimide pattern.

## Abstract
A developer comprising A at least one solvent selected from N,N dimethylacetamide, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and γ butyrolactone, B methanol and C at least one solvent represented by the formula R¹OCH₂CH₂OCH₂CH₂OR² wherein R¹ is a hydrogen atom or R², and R² is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, is used to remove areas of photosensitive polyimide precursor which have not been exposed to actinic radiation when forming a polyimide pattern on a base plate by exposing imagewise to actinic radiation through a mask a layer of photosensitive polyimide precursor on the base plate, removing unexposed area using a developer and curing the resultant pattern of the polyimide precursor. The resulting pattern may be used as an insulator or a protective coating for multi layered semiconductor integrated circuits.
