# A PRODUCT TO BE USED IN DENTAL AMALGAMS

## Abstract
A new amalgamable powder is disclosed containing, in the preferred embodiment, by weight, a mixture of between 24 and 56 silver, 20 and 48 tin, and 12.5 and 43 copper, in which when the tin copper relation is between 1 1 and 2.50 1, the silver tin relation is between 0.75 1 and 1.8 1, and when the tin copper relation is between 0.75 1 and 1 1, the silver tin relation is between 0.75 1 and 2.5 1. In the amalgamable powder at least a portion of the particles are of irregular polyhedral shape, obtained by mechanical means starting from a solid state alloy, while the remainder of the particles, if any, are spheroidal shape, obtained by rapid sol idification from a liquid state. In addition, at least 80 of the particles of the powder have their largest dimension greater than 4 microns.
