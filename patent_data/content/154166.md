A repaired elastomer article having a cut or crack entirely therethrough. A treating agent is located about the cut portion on the inner surface of the article and an amine curable polymer or prepolymer layer resides over said treating agent. A cured elastomeric patch resides over said curable polymer. Since the amine curable polymer cures at ambient temperatures, the repair of the elastomer article can occur on site. The invention is especially useful in the repair of tires.
