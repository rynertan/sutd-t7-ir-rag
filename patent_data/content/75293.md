## Description
Method for inhibiting f3 D galactosidase The present invention relates to a novel method for inhibiting ss D galactosidase in order to terminate ss D galactosidase catalyzed reactions.In recent years, ss D galactosidase has progressively found its application as an enzyme for labelling an antibody or an antigen in enzyme immunoassays hereinafter referred to as ElA . In EIA, since the measured value of the ss D galactosidase activity is directly reflected as the amount of the component to be measured, it is necessary, on measuring the ss D galacto sidase activity, to obtain the accurate measured value of the enzyme reaction product with a high sensitivity.Heretofore, as the method for measuring the ss D galactosidase activity in the field of EIA, a method has been employed which comprises using chiefly a synthetic substrate and, as a means for terminating the ss D galactosidase catalyzed reaction, shifting the pH value of the reaction mixture to an alkaline side which widely deviates from the optimal pH range for ss D galactosidase. However, although shifting the pH for terminating the enzyme reaction was operatively simple, this procedure could not completely inhibit ss D galactosidase. Therefore, in case that the amount of the reaction product cannot be measured immediately after the termination of the ss D galactosidase catalyzed reaction, the action of ss D galactosidase upon the remaining substrate in the reaction mixture gradually proceeds and accordingly it is quite difficult to determine the accurate amount of the reaction product and also, quite often, the measured results are widely scattering.Especially, with the increase in reaction temperature, the phenomenon of this scattering in measured results is further increased. As a result of intensive studies for the purpose of solving the aforesaid problem in the measuring method of ss D galactosidase activity , the present inventors have discovered that by bringing ss D galactosidase and a chelating agent in contact with each other in an alkaline pH range other than the optimal pH range for ss D galacto sidase, the ss D galactosidase catalyzed reaction can be terminated completely.According to this method, since the operation is simple and ss D galactosidase activity may be determined without any restriction from the aspect of the measuring time, this method is extremely advantageous in practice.Of course, the conventional conditions and manners for measuring the reaction product of the ss D galactosidase catalyzed reaction may be directly employed.The chelating agent used in this invention is a polydentate ligand which forms a chelate compound by coordinating with a metal ion, and may be used as a salt, such as an alkali metal salt of e.g. sodium, potassium etc., a heavy metal salt of e.g. cobalt, copper etc., and the like.Specific examples thereof include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid hereinafter referred to as EDTA , ethylenediamine, oxalic acid, oxines, amino acids, acetylacetone, pyrophosphoric acid, hydroxylamine, chelating polymers, metal adsorbing polymers etc. Among those, EDTA is generally preferred because it has an extremely strong effect to inhibit ss D galactosidase and it does not require handling as a poisonous chemical.In general, the chelating agent has 2 or more functional groups coordinating with a metal ion, and it is known that their main coordinating atoms, namely oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, coordinate in such form as O,O coordinatio 1, N,N coordination, S,S coordination, O,N coordination, S,Ncoordination or O,S coordination to form a chelatermg chelating agent having such various coordinations may be employed in the present invention. While the chelating agent in the present invention may be used alone as a single chelating agent, it is generally preferred to use it in combination with other adjuvants, such as a buffer, because the effect to inhibit ss D galactosidase is further enhanced.On this occasion, the present invention may be practiced without being influenced by the components composition and liquid properties of the buffer used in combination with the chelating agnet or without being restricted by the source of ss D galactosidase or the kind of the reaction product to be measured. Further, on practicising the present invention, ss D galactosidase may be in either free form or insolubilized form, and the means for measuring the reaction product from the enzyme substrate by ss D galactosidase may be any of e.g.colorimetry, spectrometry, fluophotometry, emission spectrometry etc. The amount of the chelating agent to be used in the present invention is not particularly restricted because even an extremely small amount can satisfactorily exhibit the effect to inhibitI3 D galacto sidase, but it is desired that the chelating agent is present in an amount of 1 mM or more, taking into consideration the relationship with the amount of ss D galactosidase to be used. ss D galactosidase and the chelating agent are brought into contact with each other at an alkaline pH range other than the optimal pH range for the enzyme reaction, for example, pH 9 11.5, preferably pH 10 10.5.The present invention is more particularly described by the following examples.

Example 4Relationship between the inhibitory effect of EDTA on ss D galactosidase and the pHSimilarly as in Example 2, glass beads having the TSH antibody insolubilized thereon were contacted with theTSH enzyme complex labelled with ss D galactosidase derived from Echerichia coli, to prepare beads having ss D galacto sidase insolubilized on their surface.Thereafter, to test tubes, each containing 0.30 ml of a 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3 containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1 NaN3, 0.1 M NaC1 and 10 mM MgC12,were transferred the above beads with insolubilized ss D galactosidase, and, after adding 0.05 ml of the enzyme substrate solution employed in Example 2, each mixture was incubated statically at 370C.
