Detailed Description Of The Invention The present invention provides a selectable and autonomously replicating recombinant DNA expression vector which comprises a a runaway replicon and b a transcriptional and translational activating sequence which is in the reading frame of a gene that codes for a bioactive bovine growth hormone derivative, said gene being EMI5.1 EMI6.1 wherein A is deoxyadenyl, G is deoxyguanyl, C is deoxycytidyl, T is thymidyl, R is a DNA sequence that codes for amino acids 9 leucine through 191 phenylalanine of bovine growth hormone, and R1 is a DNA sequence that codes for a translational stop signal which isEMI6.2 The invention further relates novel transformants of the aforementioned vectors, compounds, granules and methods of use. The present invention can be constructed by independently ligating the following XbaI HgiAI DNA linker sequencesEMI7.1 into the c10.2 kb BamHI XbaI and 0.6 kb BamHI HqiAI fragments of plasmid pCZ101. The resultant plasmids, respectively designated as plasmids pCZ1920, pJRl and pAT2, contain 1 the E. coli lipoprotein gene transcriptional and translational activating sequence Nakamura and Inouye, 1979, Cell 18 1109 in the reading frame of a coding sequence for a bioactive bovine growth hormone derivative 2 an appropriately placed translational stop signal and 3 a runaway replicon.Cells transformed by plasmids pCZ1920, pJR1 and pAT2 respectively express MET LYS GLY ASPN SER MET ALA bGH, MET PHE PRO ALA MET ALA R2 and MET bGH where in MET is methionine, LYS is lysine, GLY is glycine, ASPN is asparagine, SER is serine, ALA is alanine, PHE is phenylalanine, PRO is proline, bGH is the natural amino acid sequence of bovine growth hormone beginning with the N terminal first phenylalanine R2is the natural amino acid sequence of bovine growth hormone beginning with the sixth amino acid leucine from the N terminus.A restriction site map of each of plasmids pCZ1920 and pJRl is presented in Figure 9 of the accompanying drawings. Additional plasmids that are also within the scope of the present invention can be constructed by independently ligating the following 2SgI HgiAI DNA inker sequencesEMI8.1 EMI9.1 EMI10.1 wherein A is deoxyadenyl, G is deoxyguanyl, C is deoxycytidyl and T is thymidyl, into the 10 kb EcoRI BamHI and 0.6 kb BamHI HgiAI fragments of plasmid pCZ101 and the 0.29 kb EcoRI ClaI fragment of plasmid pNM608. The resultant plasmids, respectively designated as plasmids pCZ112, pATI, pASPI, pASP2, pCZ154, pCZ155 and pCZ156, contain 1 the E. coli tryptophan gene transcriptional and translational activating sequence Hallewell and Emtage, 1980, Gene 9 27 in the reading frame of a coding sequence for a bioactive bovine growth hormone derivative 2 an appropriately placed translational stop signal and 3 a runaway replicon.Cells transformed by plasmids pCZ112, pATI, pASP1, pASP2, pCZ154,pCZ155 and pCZ156 respectively express MET ASP ASP LYS bGH, MET ASP bGH,MET ASP bGH, MET VAL bGH, MET ALA PHE RPO ALA MET SERLEU SER VAL b GH, and MET ASP bGH, wherein MET is methionine, ASP is aspartic acid, LEU is leucine, SER is serine, PRO is proline, PHE is phenylalanine, LYS is lysine VAL is valine, ALA is alanine, b GE is the natural amino acid sequence of bovine growth hormone beginning with amino acid 9, leucine, and bGH is the natural amino acid sequence of bovine growth hormone beginning with the N terminal first phenylalanine. A restriction site map of illustrative plasmid pCZ112 is presented in Figure 10 of the accompanying drawings. The plasmid pCZ101 starting material is s10.8 kb and is constructed by ligating the s0.6 kb XbaI BamBI fragment of plasmid pNM789B into similarly digested plasmid pIM I A3. The latter plasmid, which contains the transcriptional and translational activating sequence of the E. coli lipoprotein gene as well as a runaway replicon, can be obtained from E. coli K12 RV308 pIM I A3, a strain deposited and made part of the permanent stock culture collection of the NorthernRegional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois. The strain is available as a preferred source and stock reservoir of the plasmid under the accession number NRRLB 15733.The plasmid pNM789B starting material is derived from plasmid pKENlll in accordance with the steps illustrated and described in Figures 1 8 andExample 1 below. Plasmid pKENl1l can be obtained fromE. coli K12 CC620 pKENlll, a strain deposited and made part of the permanent stock culture collection of theNorthern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois.The strain is available as a preferred source and stock reservoir of the plasmid under the accession numberNRRL B 15011. Plasmid pNM789B also contains the transcriptional and translational activating sequence of the E. coli lipoprotein gene and, in addition, the coding sequence, including an appropriately positioned translational stop signal, for a fusion protein comprising bGE and a nine member polypeptide at the bGH Nterminus. Ligation of the fusion protein coding sequence, contained in the XbaI BamHI fragment, to appropriately cleaved plasmid pIM I A3 results in the aforementioned plasmid pCZ101 starting material. The plasmid pNM608 starting material is 4.6 kb and is constructed by ligating the EcoRI ClaI fragment of plasmid pHI7A41 into EcoRI ClaI digested plasmid pBR322. Plasmid pHI7A4hl can be constructed in accordance with the teaching of Example 5 below. Be cause of the multiplicity of TagI restriction sites in plasmid pHI7 4 1, the desired c fragment can best be generated by subcloning the pHI7 4 1 EcoRI TagI and EwaI TaqI fragments. Plasmid pNM608 contains the E.coli tryptophan transcriptional activating sequence and is thus useful for constructing the present invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the various DNA linkers described above are important components of the present invention. These sequences can be conventionally synthesized by the modified phosphotriester method using fully protected dideoxy ribonucleotide building blocks. Such synthetic methods are well known in the art and can be carried out in substantial accordance with the procedure of Itakura et al., 1977, Science 198 1056 and Crea et al., 1978, Proc.Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 75 5765. In addition, an especially preferred method is disclosed in Hsiung et al., 1983,Nucleic Acid Research 11 3227 and Narang et al., 1980,Methods in Enzymology 68 90. The linkers code for a translational activating sequence and also amino acids comprising the first portion N terminus region of the aforementioned bGH derivative compounds. The remainder of the bGR coding sequence including an appropriately positioned translational stop signal and also a transcriptional activating sequence can be provided by ligation of the appropriate fragment of. plasmid pCZ101. Such ligations result in the illustrative bovine growth hormone derivative expression plasmids of the present invention. Deletion of the 900 bp BstEII restriction fragment o f plasmid pCZ101, followed by recircularization, results in plasmid pCZlO3. The BstEII deletion does not affect the bGH coding region in plasmid pCZlOl.Using plasmid pCZ103 in place of plasmid pCZ101 in the above described constructions thus results in similar, but 900 bp smaller, plasmids The bGE derivatives expressed by these pCZl03 derived plasmids are therefore identical to the derivatives expressed by their pCZlOlderived counterparts. Thus, musing the 9.3 kb BamHI XbaI and 0.6 kbBamHI HgiAI restriction fragments of plasmid pCZ103, in place of the 10.2 kb BamHI XbaI and 0.6 kb BamHI HgiAI restriction fragments of plasmid pCZl0l, in the abovedescribed constructions of plasmids pJR1 and pAT2 results in the construction of derivative plasmids pJR1.3 and pAT2.3, respectively.Using the 9.3 kb BamHI EcoRI and 0.6 kb BamHI HgiAI restriction fragments of plasmid pCZ103, in place of the 10.2 kb BamHI EcoRI and s0.6 kbBamHI HgiAI restriction fragments of plasmid pCZ101, in the above described constructions of plasmids pATl, pASP1, pASP2, pCZ154,pCZ155 and pCZ156 results in the construction of derivative plasmids pAT1.3, pASP2.3, pCZ154.3, pCZ155.3, and pCZ156.3, respectively. The present invention is in no way limited to the use of a particular transcriptional activating sequence since the choice of a specific sequence is not critical to the operability of the present invention.Transcriptional activating sequences which can be substituted for the previously exemplified lipoprotein and tryptophan activating sequences include, but are not limited to, the E . coli lactose lac , bacteriophage A PLOL and bacteriophage A PROR transcriptional activat ing sequences. In addition, one or more transcriptional activating sequences, or parts of them, can be used in tandem, such as, for example, the trp and lac or tac transcriptional activating sequences. All of the aforementioned sequences have been previously characterized and can be constructed either synthetically or from known plasmids. In the specific embodiments herein described, plasmid replication is determined by a thermoinducible runaway replicon disclosed in both GB Patent PublicationNumber 1,557,774 and Uhlin et al., 1979, Gene 6 91. At temperatures below 30 C, especially 250C, the replicon maintains a relatively low copy number of about 10 15 copies per cell. When the temperature is raised to 37 C, copy number control is lost and plasmids containing the replicon amplify to 1000 2000 copies per cell.The particular runaway replicon exemplified herein is contained in the previously described plasmid pIM I A3 starting material. Skilled artisans will understand that the present invention is not limited to the use of any particular runaway replicon or copy number mutant.Other inducible runaway or high copy number replicons can be obtained by appropriate selection or can be constructed in accordance with the procedure disclosed in International Publication Number W082 02901. Such replicons can be used to construct expression vectors that are also within the scope of the present invention. The cloning of foreign genes into vectors containing a runaway replicon results, upon induction and loss of copy number control, in a greatly increased rate of protein synthesis and the concomitant formation of a heretofore unknown and unrecognized species of intracellular proteinaceous granule. Such granules, which further comprise the present invention, are highly homogeneous in their protein composition and are thus distinguishable over the known high molecular weight aggregates and inclusions that sometimes occur in recombinant DNA containing host cells. The latter inclusions are heterogeneous, commonly containing an assortment of cellular components, such as nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids and peptides, and comprise only 10 20 of a particular protein product.The granules of the present invention are highly homogeneous with the desired protein product comprising at least 50 and often exceeding 80 of the granule. The present novel species of granule can be readily isolated from cell lysates and is stable to washing in low concentrations of urea or detergents.Washing removes proteins that bind non specifically to the granule. Isolation, which generates high specific activity material, constitutes a useful first step in the purification of foreign proteins All subsequent steps in purification are therefore simplified. Particularly helpful is the fact that cell wall components can be readily separated from the granules. It is believed that the formation of the granules of the present invention sequesters a foreign protein such that disruption of normal cell metabolism and premature cell death does not occur. Some proteins, such as human proinsulin, are rapidly degraded in E. col and do not accumulate. However, when such proteins are coded for in vectors containing a runaway replicon, the proinsulin protein forms insoluble granules that protect the ordinarily unstable protein from proteolytic degradation. The formation of the present species of granule is thus useful not only for accumulating unstable proteins, but also for simplifying procedures for isolating and purifying gene products. The present invention thus further comprises a method for producing an intracellular highly homogeneous species of foreign proteinacious granule, said method comprising 1 transforming a competent cell witn a selectable and autonomoulsly replicating recombinant DNA expression vector which comprises a a runaway replicon. anc b a transcriptional and translationa activating sequence which is reading frame of a nucleotide sequence that codes for a functiona polypepdide, said functional poly peptide coding sequence containing a translational stop s7a positioned iamediately adjacent an ownstreat from the nucleotide triplet that codes for the carboxy terminus of said functional polypeptide, and 2 culturing the transformed cell under growth conditions suitable for gene expression and activation or induction said runaway replicon. Any runaway replicon and transcriptional any translational activating sequence, as previously described herein, and nucleotide sequence that codes for a functional polipeptide or fused gen product can be used to construct vectors for use in but are not limited to, sequences that code for bovine growth morse bGH , human growth hormone bGH , human pre grwoth hormone pre bGH , porcine grwoth hormone pGH , mammalian grwoth hormone,avian grwoth hormone, growth hormone realising factor, human insulin A chain, human r.suiin B chain human proinsulin, human preproinsulin human and non human interferon, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, interleukin II, any polypeptide hormone, any polypeptide enzyme and any bioactive polypeptide of research or commercial value. Transformed cells which, upon culturing in accordance with the above defined method, exemplify the production of the present species of granule include, but are not limited to, E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ1920, E.coli K12 RV308 pJR1, E. coli K12 RV308 pASP1, E coliK12 RV308 pCZ112, E coli K12 RV308 pASP2, E coli K12RV308 pAT1 E. coli K12 RV308 pAT2, E. coli K12RV308 pCZ154, E. coli 12 RY308 pCZ156, E. coli K12RV308 pJR1.3, E. coli K12 RV308 pASP1.3, E. coli K12RV308 pAT2.3, E. coli K12 RV308 pAT1.3, E. coli K12RV308 pAT2.3, E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ154.3, and E. coliK12 RV308 pCZ156.3. The present method for producing a highly homogeneous species of granule is not limited to the use of the above plasmids coding for bovine or human growth hormone. Human proinsulin granules can also be produced by culturing cells, in accordance with the aforementioned method, that contain vectors comprising the human proinsulin coding sequence. Such a vector can be constructed by ligating a trDLE proinsulin fusion sequence containing EcoRI BamHI fragment, as depicted in Figure 15, into the large EcoRI BamBI fragment of plasmid pCZ101. The resultant plasmid, designated as plasmid pCZ201, can transform E. coli, such as E. coliK12 RV308, in accordance with conventional transformation methods. The present granules, which in this case comprise human proinsulin, can then be produced by culturing the E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ201 transformants at 370C. Many modifications and variations of the present illustrative DNA sequences and plasmids are possible. For example, the degeneracy of the genetic code allows for the substitution of nucleotides throughout polypeptide coding regions as well as for the substitution of theEMI19.1 translational stop signals for theEMI19.2 translational stop signal specifically exemplified. Thus R, as defined hereinabove, can be one of any number of possible DNA sequences that code for amino acids 9 leucine through 191 phenylalanine of bGH. Such sequences can be deduced from the known amino acid sequence of bGH and can be constructed by following conventional synthetic procedures.However, nucleotide triplets should be chosen in accordance with known principles and extrapolations reviewed in Zuker andStiegler, 1981, Nucleic Acids Research 9 1 133, to avoid generating complementary bases in mRNA. Hydrogen bonding pairing between such complementary bases results in stem and loop configurations and folding that reduce the efficiency of translation. Skilled artisans will understand that all of the modifications and variations disclosed above can be conventionally synthesized in substantial accordance with the synthetic methods previously cited. Therefore, the present invention is in no way limited to the DNA sequences and plasmids specifically exemplified. The expression vectors and method of this invention can be applied to a wide range of host organisms, for example, gram negative prokaryotic organisms such as Escherichia coli, E. coli K12, E. coli K12 RV308, E. coli K12 Hub101, E. coli K12 C600, E. coli K12C600 Rk Mk , E. coli K12 RR1, E. coli K12 MM294 and the like.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that the expression vectors of this invention are used to transform suitable host organisms such that a bovine growth hormone derivative product is expressed using standard fermentation conditions. The product, expressed as a highly homogeneous granule and isolated by routine methods from the resulting cell lysates is useful for increasing milk production and for generally stimulating growth in cattle.

Construction of Plasmid pKEN021 and the XbaI BamHI Fragment Thereof The 5.1 kb fragment produced by XbaI BamHI cleavage of plasmid pKEN021 106 in Figure 3 was used as starting material. Plasmid pKEN021 is a derivative of pKENlll, 101 in Figure 1 and further described inLee, et al., 1981, J. Bact. 146 861 866 and Zwiebel, et al., 1981, J. Bact. 145 654 656 , which is on deposit in E. coli CC620 NRRL Deposit No. 15011 and which has a 2.8kb fragment which contains the lipoprotein gene ofE. coli. A. description of this fragment is provided inNakamura and Inouye, 1979, Cell 18 1109 1117.In pKEN021, the 650 bp base pair sequence between the unique EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pBR322 has been replaced by sequences taken from the lipoprotein gene of E. coli. The lipoprotein gene sequence Nakamura and Inouye, 1979 includes a 462 bp AluI fragment, upstream from the first triplet methionine of the lipoprotein gene that contains the promoter, the 5 untranslated region and the ribosome binding site. A unique XbaI restriction site is located within the ribosome binding site 16 bp before the translation initiating methionine signal. A PvuII restriction site located 105 bp upstream from the translation termination codon of the structural gene was,changed to a BamHI restriction site by the addition of a synthetic DNA linker 5 CCGGATCCGG3 , obtained from CollaborativeResearch .The coding sequence for the last thirty five amino acids of lipoprotein, the translation termination signal, and the sequence corresponding to the 3 untranslated region of the messenger RNA follow the BamHI site. Plasmid pKEN021 also includes some 850 bp of extraneous sequences unrelated to the lipoprotein gene and located downstream of it in the E. coli chromosome.These sequences were included as a consequence of the methods and restriction enzyme sites used in the original isolation of the gene. Referring to Figures 1, 2, and 3, plasmid pKEN021 is derived from p Nlll in the following manner About 50 g of pKENlll 101 in Figure 1 are digested with 25 units of EpaII restriction enzyme in 400 pl of a buffer containing 20mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, l0mM MgCl2, and 6mM ss mercaptoethanol at 370C for 2 hours. The mixture is extracted twice with 300 p1 of a 50 50 mixture of phenol and chloroform and the recovered aqueous phase is then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate. The DNA pellet is dissolved in 100 p1 of electrophoresis buffer and fractionated on a 5 percent polyacrylamide gel acrylEmide bis ratio is 29 1 in all gels except where noted . The gel is stained in a solution containing 0.5 pg ml of ethidium bromide and bands are visualized under long wave length ultraviolet light. A 950 bp band is isolated and recovered from the gel by electroelution into a dialysis bag. After phenol CHC13 extraction and ethanol precipi tation, the recovered DNA approximately 2.5 pg is dissolved in 25 pl of TEN lOmM NaCl, lOmM Tris HCl pE 7.4 and lmM sodium ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate EDTA , pH 8.0 . About 2 pg of the 950 bp HpaII fragment are digested with Alul restriction enzyme in 200 p1 of a buffer containing 50mM NaCl, 6mM TrisHC1 pH 7.6 , 6mMMgC12, and 6mM ss mercaptoethanol for 2 hours at 370C.The DNA is fractionated on a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel and the 462 bp AluI fragment generated is recovered and purified by the method previously described. The 462 bp Alul fragment approximately 1 pg is dissolved in 10 p1 of T4 DNA ligase buffer 66mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, lOmM MgCl2, lOmM dithiothreitol, 0.4mM ATP containing 150 picomoles of phosphorylated EcoRI linker 5 GGAATTCC3 from Collaborative Research and 2 units T4 DNA ligase.After incubation at 40C. for 16 hours, the mixture is heated at 650C. for 10 minutes and diluted to 10Q p1 with the addition of EcoRI buffer 100mM Tris HCl pH 7.2, 50mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl2, 6mM ss mercaptoethanol and 40 units EcoRI enzyme. After 2 hours at 370C., the sample is conventionally phenol CHC13 extracted and ethanol precipitated. The DNA is then dissolved in 20 pl of T4DNA ligase buffer containing 0.1 unit T4 DNA ligase and 0.1 pg pBR322 102 in Figure 1 which has been linearized with EcoRI and then treated with alkaline phosphatase.After ligation at 40C for 16 hours, the resultant DNA is used to conventionally transform E. coli strain K12HB101. Transformants are selected on agar plates containing 12 pg ml of tetracycline and plasmids isolat ed from resistant colonies by the rapid alkaline extraction procedure described in Birnboim and Doly, 1979,Nucleic Acids Research 7 1513 1523. A plasmid 103 inFigure 1 containing a 466 bp XbaI BamHI fragment is selected and used as the starting material for the step next described. About two pg of this plasmid 103 in Figure 2 are digested with 2 units of HindIII enzyme in 50 p1HindIII buffer 60mM NaCl, lOmM TrisHC1, pH 7.4, lOmMMgCl2 and 6mM ss mercaptoethanol for 1 hour at 37 C.After phenol CRCl3 extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA is dissolved in 200 pl of a buffer containing 300mM NaCl, 30mM sodium acetate pH 4.25, lmM ZnCl2 and 200 units of S1 nuclease Miles Laboratories . After 1 hour at 150C., the reaction is stopped by phenol CHC13 extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resultant DNA is dissolved in 10 p1 T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 20 picomoles phosphorylated BamHI linkers 5 CCGGATCCGG3 , from Collaborative Research and 2 units T4 DNA ligase.After 16 hours at 40C, the reaction mixture is heated at 650C for 10 minutes to inactivate the ligase and then diluted to 100 pl in BamHI buffer 150mM NaCl, 20mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 10mM MgCl2, 6mM ss mercaptoethanol containing 20 units BamHI enzyme. After 2 hours at 370C, the mixture is purified on a 1 percent agarose gel. The gel is stained and the larger fragment 4.5 kb is recovered by elution after freezing and then purified by phenol CHC13 extraction and ethanol precipitation. The recovered fragment with BamHI cohesive ends is dissolved in 20 pl of T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 0.1 unit T4 DNA ligase. After 16 hours at 4 C, the DNA is used to transform E. coliHB101.Transformants are selected by resistance to ampicillin Apr at 100 pg ml and screened for sensitivity, to 10 pg ml tetracycline Tc5 . Several plasmids, prepared by the previously described Birnboim procedure from colonies which are AprTcs, are examined for the absence of a HindIII site and the presence of a single BamHI site. EcoRI, SalI sequential digestion yields a 466 bp and a 305 bp fragment. A plasmid 104 in Figure 2 with these characteristics is selected and then modified to convert the EcoRI site, located upstream of the lpp promoter, to a HindIII restriction site. Two micrograms of plasmid lO4 in Figure 2 are digested in 100 p1 of EcoRI buffer with 0.2 units ofEcoRI for 10 minutes at 370C. The reaction is stopped by heating for 10 minutes at 650C and then, after phenol CHC13 extraction, the DNA is ethanol precipitated, dissolved in 200 p1 of S1 nuclease buffer containing S1 nuclease at 1000 units ml and reacted at 120C for 1 hour. The reaction is stopped by phenol CHC13 extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resultant DNA is resuspended in 10 p1 of T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 20 picomoles phosphorylated HindIII linker S CCAAGCTTGG3 , from Collaborative Research and 2 units of T4 DNA ligase.After 16 hours at 40C, the mixture is heated for 10 minutes at 650C, diluted to 150 p1 in HindIII buffer containing 10 units HindIII enzyme, incubated for 2 hours at 370C and then fractionated on a 1 percent agarose gel. The largest band equivalent to single cut plasmid is conventionally recovered and purified, dissolved in 20 p1 T4 ligase buffer containing 0.2 unitsT4 ligase, incubated 16 hours at 4 C. and then used to transform E. coli HB101. Transformants are selected for ampicillin resistance and plasmid isolates conventionally analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis. A plasmid 105 in Figure 2 with an EcoRI HindII fragment of 500 bp is selected and used as the cloning vector for addition of the 3 region of the lpp gene. About two pg of plasmid 105 in Figure 3 are digested in 50 p1 of SalI restriction buffer 150mMNaCl, 6mM Tris ECl, pH 7.9, 6mM MgCl2, 6mM ss mercapto ethanol with 2 units of SalI for 1 hour at 370C and then diluted to 150 p1 in BainHI buffer containing 2 units BamHI. After 1 hour at 37 C, 2.5 units of alkaline phosphatase are added and then incubation is continued for 1 hour at 650C. The material is phenol CEC13 extracted, ethanol precipitated, dissolved in TEN, and used as a cloning vector for the lpp 3 fragment. To obtain the fragment containing the lpp 3 region, 10 pg of pKEN111 101 in Figure 3 are digested in 200 p1 of HpaI buffer 20mM KCl, lOmM Tris HC1, pH 7.4, lOmM MgC12 and 6mM ss mercaptoethanol with 10 units of EpaI for 2 hours at 370C. After phenol CEC13 extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA is dissolved in 10 p1 T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 20 picomoles phosphorylated SalI linker S GGTCGACC3 , from Collaborative Research and 2 units T4 DNA ligase and then incubated for 16 hours at 40C. The ligase is inactivated by heating at 650C for 10 minutes.The resultant material is diluted to 100 pl in SalI buffer containing 10 units of SalI and incubated 1 hour at 370C, and then diluted to 300 p1 in PvuII buffer 60mM NaCl, 6mM Tris ECl, pH 7.5, 6mM MgC12, 6mM ss mercaptoethanol containing 10 units PvuII restriction enzyme. After 1 hour at 370C, the DNA is fractionated on a 5 percent polyacrylamide gel. Approximately 0.5 pg of a 950 bp fragment is recovered, purified and dissolved in TEN.Two tenths microgram of the fragment is diluted into 20 p1 T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 20 picomoles phosphorylated BamHI linker 5 CCGGATCCGG3 , fromCollaborative Research and 2 units T4 DNA ligase and then incubated for 16 hours at 40C. The resultant DNA is then heated for 10 minutes at 650C, diluted to 100 p1 in Ba,HI buffer containing 20 units BamHI, incubated at 370C for 2 hours and then fractionated on a 5 percent polyacrylamide gel to remove excess linker molecules.The resultant 950 bp fragment having BamHI and SalI cohesive ends is conventionally purified and dissolved in 20 p1 of T4 DNA ligase buffer containing both 0.2 pg of the cloning vector described previously and 0.2 unitsT4 DNA ligase. After incubation for 16 hours at 40C, the DNA is used to transform E. coli K12 HB101. Plasmids are prepared from ampicillin resistant transformants and conventionally analyzed for the SalI BamHI fragment.The desired plasmid 5.2 kb is designated pKEN021 106 in Figure 3 . Ten micrograms of pKEN021 were digested at 370C in 200 pl of XbaI BamHI buffer 150mM Nail, 10 Tris Hcl, pH 8, 10mM MgCl2, 6mM ss mercaptoethanol using 10 units of BamHI for 1 hour followed by 10 units ofXbaI for an additional hour at 370C. The desired XbaI BamHI digested DNA was then treated with 2.5 units of alkaline phosphatase for 1.5 hours at 650C, phenol CEC13 extracted, collected by ethanol precipitation, and dissolved in 50 pi of TEN for future use 107 inFigure 3 .B. Construction of Plasmid pNM575 Plasmid ptrpED50chGH800 108 in Figure 4 , described in Martial et al., 1979, Science 205 602 607 was used as the source of a DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for a portion of the human growth hormone gene. This fragment can also be constructed synthetically Itakura et al., 1977 and Crea et al., 1978 or can be obtained using recognized methodology described by Goodman et al., 1979, Methods in Enzymology 68 75 90, by isolating mRNA coding for human growth hormone from human pituitaries. The human growth hormone gene portion of plasmid ptrpED50chGR800 contains a unique SmaI restriction site 6 bp downstream from the translation termination codon of the gene.This site was changed to a BamHI site using the following procedure 6 pg of the plasmid were digested with 6 units ofSmaI in 200 p1 of SmaI restriction buffer 15mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0 6mM MgCl2, 15mM KCl and 6mM ss mercaptoethanol for 1.5 hours at 370C. After digestion was complete, phenol CHCI3 extraction was performed and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and then dissolved in 24 p1 of TEN. Forty picomoles of phosphorylated BainHI adapter fragment Collaborative Research were added to 0.5 pg 0.2 picomole ends of the above digested plasmid in 16 pl of ligase buffer containing 2 units T4 DNA ligase.The mixture was incubated 2 hours at 220C, 16 hours at 40C and then 10 minutes at 650C. BamHI cohesive termini were generated by conventional digestion with BamHI restriction enzyme. The enzyme cleaved the linker sequence as well as the BamHI site located at the beginning of the cloned human growth hormone cDNA sequence. This yielded a 691 bp fragment with cohesive BamRI ends which was separated on a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel and then conventionally recovered. The recovered DNA fragment was ligated using 0.2 unit T4DNA ligase in 20 p1 of buffer under previously described conditions with 0.2 pg of BamBI digested and alkaline phosphatase treated pBR322 102 in Figure 4 . After 16 hours at 40C, the material was used to transform E. coli strain JA221 NRRL No.B 15014 in substantial accordance with the transformation procedure of Wensink et awl., 1974, Cell 3 315 325 Transformants were selected on agar plates containing 100 pg m1 ampicillin and then plasmids were conventionally isolated and identified by restriction enzyme and gel electrophoretic analysis.Desired plasmids, designated as pNM575 109 in Figure 4 , contain a BamHI fragment of approximately 700 bp and were conventionally amplified for future use. C. Construction of Plasmid pNM702 The DNA sequence of mature human growth hormone contains one FnuDII site which is 47 bp from the first nucleotide. Twenty five micrograms of pNM575 were digested in 250 p1 of BamHI buffer with 25 units ofBamHI at 370C for 1 hour. The 691 bp fragment withBamHI cohesive termini was conventionally isolated from a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel and purified.After purification of the fragment, one third of it equivalent to 8 pg of plasmid was digested in 100 pi ofFnuDII buffer 6mM Nail, 6mM TRis HCl, pH 7.4, 6mM MgC12, 6mM ss mercaptoethanol with 2.5 units FnuDII for 1.5 hours at 370C. Electrophoresis on a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel and standard recovery procedures were used to isolate a 538 bp DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for the last 175 amino acids of the gene followed by a translation stop signal. A double stranded DNA fragment 110 in Figure 5 was synthesized by the phosphotriester method to join the lpp promoter region with the human growth hormone coding region. The double stranded DNA fragment 110 inFigure 5 has the following sequence XbaIEMI31.1 The fragment was prepared by recognized phosphotriester methodology by which the following segments were prepared 1 CTAGAGGGTAT 2 TAATAATGTTCC 3 CATTGGATGAT 4 GATGATAAGTTCC 5 CAACCATTCCC 6 TTATCCAGGC 7 TTTTTGACAACG 8 CTATGCTCCG 9 CATTATTAATACCCT 10 ATGGGAA 11 CTTATCATCATCATCCA 12 GCTTGGGAA 13 GGATAAGGGAAT 14 GTCAAAAAGCCT 15 CGCAGCATAGCGTT Using the above prepared segments, the T4 ligase catalyzed joining reactions were performed stepwise as described below a 5 Unphosphorylated segment 1 was joined to 5 phosphorylated segment 2 in the presence of 51 phosphorylated segment 9 using T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 1 Brown et al., 1979, Methods in Enzymology 68 109 151 . The duplex was isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis on 15 polyacrylamide. b 5 Phosphorylated segment 3 was joined to 5 phosphorylated segment 4 in the presence of 5 phosphorylated segment 11 using T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 2 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. c 5 Phosphorylated segment 5 was joined to 5 phosphorylated segment 6 in the presence of 5 phosphorylated segments 12 and 13 using T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 3 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. d 5 Phosphorylated segment 7 was joined to 5 phosphorylated segment 8 in the presence of 5 phosphorylated segment 14 and 5 unphosphorylated segment 15 using T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 4 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. e The DNA duplexes 2, 3 and 4 then were joined together by T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 5 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. f 5 phosphorylated segment 10 and DNA duplex 5 were added, in the presence of T4 ligase, to the DNA duplex 1. The resulting DNA duplex 110 inFigure 5 was purified by 10 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This DNA duplex then was enzymatically phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and y 32P ATP by following established procedure. The expression plasmid pNM702 was constructed by enzymatically joining 0.1 picomole 0.4 pg of the Xbal BamHI fragment of plasmid pKEN021 107 in Figure 5 , 0.025 picomoles synthetic DNA fragment 110 in Figure 5 and 0.3 picomoles 0.08 pg of 538 bp fragment from 109 in Figure 5 in 24 pl of ligation buffer using 1.5 unitsT4 DNA ligase. After incubation for 16 hours at 40C, the mixture was used to transform E. coli JA221 as previously described. Transformants were selected on agar plates containing 100 pg ml ampicillin and were conventionally cultured as a preferred source of the desired expression plasmid. Expression of human growth hormone was detected by a standard radioimmunoassay procedure Twomey et al., 1974, Clin. Chem. 20 389 391 and was determined to be at least 2 million molecules per cell.D. Construction of Plasmid pNM789 Plasmid pNM702 111 in Figure 6 , .the expression plasmid for human growth hormone, was used as the starting material for construction of a plasmid expressing Met Phe Pro Leu Asp Asp Asp Asp Lys bGE. Plasmid pBP348 112 in Figure 6 , described inMiller et al., 1980, J. Biol. Chem. 255 7521 7524, was used as the source of two DNA fragments containing the coding sequence for a portion of the bovine growth hormone gene. The plasmid contains an 831 bp bovine growth hormone encoding sequence cloned in the PstI restriction site of pBR322.As an alternative to the method described in Miller et al., 1980, the sequence for bovine growth hormone can be constructed synthetically Itakura et al., 1977 and Crea et al., 1978 or can also b e obtained from messenger RNA isolated from bovine pituitaries by the now routine procedures described by Goodman et al., 1979. The coding sequences for human growth hormone and bovine growth hormone are very similar and show much homology. Particularly useful in the construction of the expression plasmid for bovine growth hormone were the fragments generated by digestion with the restriction enzyme PvuII. The size of the fragments produced are 497 bp in human growth hormone and 494 bp in bovine growth hormone and the corresponding restriction sites occur in the same reading frames in both sequences. Ten micrograms of pNM702 111 in Figure 6 were partially digested with 1 unit of PvuII in 200 p1 of PvuII restriction buffer 60mM NaCl, 6mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 6mM MgCl2, 6mM ss mercaptoethanol for 10 minutes atAfter the reaction was stopped by heating at 65 C for 10 minutes, the DNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase and the fragments separated on a one percent agarose gel. The linear DNA fragment 113 in Figure 6 of the size that corresponded to DNA with the 497 bpPvuII fragment missing runs slightly faster than single cut plasmid was conventionally excised, purified and used in the construction of an intermediate plasmid 114 in Figure 6 . A 494 bp PvuII fragment of plasmid pBP348 was prepared by digesting 10 pg of the plasmid in 200 p1PvuII buffer containing 10 units of PvuII for 1 hour at 37 C. The fragments were separated on a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel and the desired 494 bp fragment from 112 in Figure 6 was conventionally visualized and purified. Intermediate plasmid 114 in Figure 6 was constructed by reacting 0.2 pg of the plasmid pNM702 PvuII fragment with 0.05 pg of 494 bp fragment in 20 pl of T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 2 units T4 DNA ligase for 16 hours at 4 C. After transformation and selection of transformants for ampicillin resistance, the plasmids were conventionally analyzed for the presence and proper orientation of the 494 bp PvuII fragment. Plasmids with a 494 bp PvuII fragment and a 440 bp Xbal SmaI fragment are selected for use in further constructions. Ten micrograms of the intermediate plasmid 114 in Figure 7 were digested with 1 unit PvuII in 200 pl PvuII buffer for 5 minutes at 370C. After the heating at 650C for 10 minutes, the mixture was spread on a 1 percent agarose gel and linear DNA having only a single PvuII cut per molecule was recovered and purified. This recovered material approximately 3 pg was digested completely with 5 units of XbaI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The fragments were spread on a 1 percent agarose gel and the largest fragment missing the 109 bp fragment between the XbaI and the firstPvuII site in human and bovine growth hormone was conventionally recovered 115 in Figure 7 . The DNA sequence for the first 23 amino acids 69 bp of bovine growth hormone to the first PvuII site contains 2 HpaII restriction sites, the first of which is 23 bp from the first nucleotide of the coding sequence. A 63 bp fragment 116 in Figure 7 was synthesized by the phosphotriester method. This fragment corresponds to the 19 bp sequence from the XbaI site in the 1PP ribosome binding site through the ATG translational start signal followed by the coding sequence forPhe Pro Leu Asp Asp Asp Asp Lys 24 bp and 20 nucleotides of the coding sequence of bovine growth hormone from Phe to the first EDaII site .The fragment has the following sequence XbaIEMI37.1 In producing the 63 bp fragment, the following nine segments were prepared 1 CTAGAGGGTAT 2 TAATAATGTTCC 3 CATTGGATGAT 4 GATGATAAGTTCC 5 CAGCCATGTCCTTGTC 6 ATGGGAACATTATTAATACCCT 7 TTATCATCATCATCCA 8 ATGGCTGCGAAC 9 CGGACAAGGAC Using the above prepared segments, the T4 ligase catalyzed joining reactions were performed stepwise as described below a 5 Unphosphorylated segment 1 was joined to 5 phosphorylated segment 2 in the presence of 5 phosphorylated segment 6 using T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 1 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. b 5 Phosphorylated segments 3, 4 and 5 were joined in the presence of 5 phosphorylated segments 7 and 8 and 5 unphosphorylated segment 9 using Tn ligase to form DNA duplex 2 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. c Duplexes 1 and 2 then were joined by T4 ligase to form DNA duplex 116 in Figure 7 which was purified by 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.This DNA duplex then was enzymatically phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and y P32 ATP following established procedure. The DNA fragment of 46 bp which runs from the above described HpaII site to the PvuII site can either be constructed synthetically or obtained from the original pBP348 piasmid. Accordingly, one hundred micrograms of plasmid pBP348 were digested in 400 p1 ofPvuII buffer with 50 units of PvuII for 2 hours at 370C.After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, theDNA was dissolved in 400 p1 of PstI buffer 50mM NaCl, 6mM Tris ECl, pR 7.4, 6mM MgC12, 6mM B mercaptoethanol with 50 units of PstI for 2 hours at 370C. The DNA fragments were spread on a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel and the 135 bp fragment containing the desired 46 bp sequence was recovered and purified by standard procedures. One third of the recovered DNA equivalent to 33 pg was subjected to limited digestion by 1 unit ofHDaII restriction enzyme in 100 p HtaII buffer 20mM Tris HCl, pE 7.4, 7mM MgCl2, 6mM B mercaptoethanol for 40 minutes at 370C.After heating at 650C for 10 minutes, the DNA fragments were run on a 5 percent acrylamide gel acrylamide bis ratio 19 1 along with an appropriate size marker. The desired 46 bp fragment yielded by HpaII partial digestion of the 135 bp fragment from 112 in Figure 7 was purified by standard procedures. Two tenths microgram of the XbaI PvuII fragment of plasmid vector 115 in Figure 7 , 3.2 picomoles of synthetic 63 bp fragment 116 in Figure 7 and 0.5 picomoles 46 bp fragment from 112 in Figure 7 were incubated in 10 p1 ligation buffer with 2 units of T4DNA ligase for 16 hours at 40C. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli JA221 and the resultant transformants, which thus contained the desired plasmid pNM789, were selected by ampicillin resistance. The identity of plasmid pNM789 117 in Figure 7 was confirmed by conventionally screening for the presence of both the 494 bp PvuII the 109 bp XbaI PvuII fragments.E. Final Construction of Plasmid pNM789B Plasmid pNM789 117 in Figure 8 requires one amino acid codon change for complete conversion to bovine growth hormone. This was accomplished by the removal of the 28 bp PvuII to BamHI fragment of pNM789 and replacement with a synthetic double stranded fragment having the following sequence 118 in Figure 8 EMI39.1 Ten micrograms of pNM789 were digested with 1 unit of PvuII in 200 pl PvuII buffer for 5 minutes at 370C. After heating 10 minutes at 650C, the mixture was diluted to 300 pl with the addition of BamHI buffer, digested to completion with 10 units of BamHI for 1 hour at 370C, treated with 5 units of alkaline phosphatase and incubated for 1 hour at 650C.The DNA fragments were separated on a 1 percent agarose gel and a DNA fragment 119 in Figure 8 about the size of single cut plasmid pNM789 was conventionally purified. Two tenths microgram of this fragment was ligated with 5 picomoles of synthetic fragment using 2 units of T4 ligase in 20 p1 ligase buffer. The ligation was carried out overnight at 40C. Following transformation, several plasmids were isolated and screened for the appropriatePvuII 494bp and XbaI BamHI 628bp fragments. Plasmids comprising the aforementioned fragments constituted the desired plasmid pNM789B 120 in Figure 8 . Example 2Construction of Plasmid pCZ101 and E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ101 A. Isolation of Plasmid DIM I A3 The bacterium E. coli K12 pIM I A3 NRRLB 15733 was cultured in TY broth 1 tryptone, 0.5 yeast extract, 0.5 sodium chloride, pH 7.4 with 50 pg ml of kanamycin at 250C according to conventional microbiological procedures. After the culture was diluted 1 10 into fresh broth and after 3 hours incubation at 370C, about .5 ml of the culture was transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for about 15 seconds. Unless otherwise indicated, all the manipulations were done at ambient temperature.The resultant supernatant was carefully removed with a fine tip aspirator and the cell pellet was resuspended in about 100 pl of freshly prepared lysozyme solution 2 mg ml which contained 2 mg ml lysozyme, 50mM glucose, 10 mMEDTA diaminetetracetate and 25 mM Tris HC1, pH 8.About 200 p1. of alkaline SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate solution O.2N NaOH, 1 SDS were added and the tube was gently inverted and then kept at OOC until lysis was complete 6 minutes . Next, about 150 p1 of 3M sodium acetate were added and the contents of the tube mixed gently by inversion for a few seconds. The tube was maintained at OOC for at least 60 minutes and then centrifuged for 15 minutes to yield an almost clear supernatant. The supernatant was transferred to a second centrifuge tube to which 3 volumes of cold 100 ethanol were added. After the tube was held on dry ice ethanol for 5 minutes, the resultant precipitate was collected by centrifugation 5 minutes and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The collected pellet was dissolved in 100 pl of TE lOmM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, lmM EDTA and constituted the desired pIM I A3 plasmid DNA. B. XbaI BamEI Digestion of Plasmid pNM789B and generation of the 0.6 kb XbaI BamHI Fragment About 5 pg of plasmid pNM789B DNA in 50 pl HiSalt buffer were incubated with 10 units each of BamHI and XbaI restriction enzymes at 370C for about 1 hour.After the addition of 5 pl of 3M sodium acetate pH 7.0, the DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of 100 ethanol.The desired DNA digest was dissolved in 100 p1 of TE buffer and stored at 0 C for future use. Hi Salt buffer was conventionally prepared with the following composition 100 mM NaCL 20 mM Tris HCL pE 8.0 10 mM MgCl2 5mM ss mercaptoethanolC. XbaI BamHI Digestion of Plasmid pIM I A3 The desired digestion was carried out in substantial accordance with the procedure of Example 2B except that plasmid pIM I A3, rather than plasmid pNM789B, was used. The desired DNA was dissolved in about 100 p1 of TE buffer and stored at OOC. for future use.D. Ligation and Transformation About 1 pg of the plasmid piM I A3 digest,I pg of the plasmid pNM789B Xbal BamHI digest, 40 p1 water, 5 pl 5mM ATP, 5 pl ligation mix and 5 units T4 DNA ligase were incubated at 200C for about 2 hours.After incubation at 650C for 2 minutes followed by cooling on ice, the resultant ligation mixture was used to transform, in substantial accordance with the transformation procedure of Wensink, 1974, Cell 3 315, E.coli K12 RV308 on TY plates 1 tryptone, 0.5 yeast extract, 0.5 sodium chloride, 1.5 agar, pH 7.4 containing 50 pg ml of kanamycin. Bacterial strain E.coli K12 RV308 has been deposited and made part of the permanent stock culture collection of the NorthernRegional Research Laboratory Peoria, Illinois, from which it is available to the public under the accession number NRRL B 15624. Some of the resultant transformants, as conventionally shown by agarose gel electrophoresis Maniatis et al., 1982 and other tests, contained only the desired 10.8 kb plasmid. Such a transformant, herein designated as E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ101, was selected, plated on TY agar containing appropriate antibiotics and then cultured using conventional microbiological techniques. The resultant cells were used to isolate plasmid pCZ101 in substantial accordance with the procedure of Example 2A. Ligation mix can be prepared with the following composition 500 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8 200 mM Dithiothreitol 100 mM MgC12 Example 3Construction of Plasmid pCZ1920 and E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ1920A. Construction of the 10.2 kb BamHI XbaI Fragment of Plasmid pCZ101 The desired fragment was constructed in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 2B except that plasmid pCZ101, rather than plasmid pNM789B, was used. The desired 10.2 kb BamRI XbaI restriction fragments were conventionally separated and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis Maniatis et al., 1982 and then dissolved in about 100 Cil of TE buffer and stored at 0 C for future use.B. Construction of the 0.6 kb BamHI HgiAL Fragment of Plasmid pCZ101 The desired fragment was constructed in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 2B except that plasmid pCZ101 and HgiAI restriction enzyme, rather than plasmid pNM789B and XbaI restriction enzyme, were respectively used. The desired 0.6 kb BamRI HgiAl restriction fragments were conventionally separated and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis Maniatis et al., 1982 and then dissolved in about 100 p1 of TE buffer and stored at 0 C for future use. C. Construction of the DNA Linker SequenceEMI45.1 The desired linker sequence was conventionally synthesized by the modified phosphotriester method in substantial accordance with the teaching of Itakura et al., 1977 and Crea et al., 1978. The aforementioned synthesis method is also specifically illustrated inExample 1.D. Ligation and Transformation About 20 picomoles of the DNA linker ofExample 3C, 1 pg of the plasmid pCZ101 10.2 kb BamRI XbaI fragment and 0.5 pg of the plasmid pCZ101 0.6 kb BamRI HAAI fragment were ligated and the resultant plasmid used to transform E. coli K12 RV308 in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 2D. Some of the resultant transformants, as conventionally shown by agarose gel electrophoresis Maniatis et al., 1982 and other tests, contained only the desired 10.8 kb plasmid. Such a transformant, herein designated as E. coli K12 RV308 pCZ1920, was selected, plated on TY agar containing appropriate antibiotics and then cultured using conventional microbiological techniques. The resultant cells were shown, by SDS gel electrophoresis, RIA and other tests, to express the aforedefined MET LYS GLY ASPN SER MET ALA bGH derivative at high levels. Because plasmid pCZ1920 contains a thermoinducible runaway replicon, maximum expression of the desired bcE derivative product occurs at culture temperatures of about 370C. Example 4Construction of Plasmid pJRl and E. coli K12 RV308 pJRl The desired constructions are made in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 3 except that the DNA linker sequenceEMI46.1 is substituted for the linker sequence of Example 3C.The above specified linker sequence can be constructed in substantial accordance with the conventional procedure of Itakura et al., 1977 and Crea et al., 1978. The aforementioned synthesis method is also specifically illustrated in Example 1. The desired transformants, herein designated as E. coli K12 RV308 pJRl, are plated on TY agar containing appropriate antibiotics and then conventionally cultured for subsequent production and isolation of plasmid pJR1. The transformants are also shown, by SDS gel electrophoresis, RIA and other tests, to express the aforedefined MET PHE PRO ALA MET ALA Rê bovine growth hormone derivative at high levels. Because plasmid pJR1 contains a thermoinducible runaway replicon, maximum expression of the desired bGH derivative product occurs at culture temperatures of about 370C. Example 5Construction of Plasmid pHI7A4A1 A partial scheme for the construction of plasmid pRI7A4A1 is presented in Figure 15 of the accompanying drawings.A. Construction of Plasmid pBRHtrp Plasmid pGMl carries the E. coli tryptophan operon containing the deletion ALE1413 Miozzari, et al., 1978, J. Bacteriology, 1457 1466 and hence expresses a fusion protein comprising the first 6 amino acids of the tro leader and approximately the last third of the trp E polypeptide hereinafter referred to in conjunction as LE , as well as the trp D polypeptide in its entirety, all under the control of the trp promoteroperator system. E. coli K12 W3110tna2trp 8102 pGMl has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection ATCC No. 31622 and pGMl may be conventionally removed from the strain for use in the procedures described below. About 20 pg of the plasmid were digested with the restriction enzyme PvuII which cleaves the plasmid at five sites. The gene fragments were next combined with EcoRI linkers consisting of a self complementary oligonucleotide of the sequence pCATGAATTCATG providing an EcoRI cleavage site for later cloning into a plasmid containing an EcoRI site. The 20 pg of DNA fragments obtained from pGMl were treated with 10 unitsT4 DNA ligase in the presence of 200 picomoles of the 5 phosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotide pCATGAATTCATG and in 20 pl T4 DNA ligase buffer 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol at 4 C overnight. The solution was then heated 10 minutes at 700C to halt ligation.The linkers were cleaved byEcoRI digestion and the fragments, now with EcoRI ends, were separated using 5 percent polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hereinafter PAGE . The three largest fragments were isolated from the gel by first staining with ethidium bromide and then locating the fragments with ultraviolet light and cutting from the gel the portions of interest. Each gel fragment, with 300 pl O.lxTBE, was placed in a dialysis bag and subjected to electrophoresis at 100 v for one hour in O.lxTBE buffer TBE buffer contains 10.8 gm Tris base, 5.5 gm boric acid, .09 gm Na2EDTA in 1 liter H20 . The aqueous solution was collected from the dialysis bag, phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, and made 0.2M with respect to sodium chloride.The DNA was then recovered in water after ethanol precipitation. The tro promoter operator containing fragments with EcoRI sticky ends were identified by insertion into a tetracycline sensitive plasmid which, upon promoter operator insertion, becomes tetracycline resistant. All DNA fragment isolations hereinafter described in this example are performed using PAGE followed by the electroelution method described above.B. Construction of Plasmid pBRHtrp Expressing Tetra cycline Resistance Under the Control of the trp Promoter Operator and Identification and AmDlifi cation of the tro Promoter Operator Containing DNA Fragment Isolated in A above. Plasmid pBRRl, Rodriguez, et al., 1979,Nucleic Acids Research 6, 3267 3287 and ATCC No. 37070 expresses ampicillin resistance and contains the gene for tetracycline resistance but, there being no associated promoter, does not express that resistance. Cells harboring the plasmid are accordingly tetracycline sensitive. By introducing a promoter operator system in the EcoRI site, the plasmid will express tetracycline resistance. Plasmid pBRRl was digested with EcoRI. The enzyme was removed by phenol extraction followed by chloroform extraction and then the DNA was resuspended in water after ethanol precipitation. The resulting DNA was, in separate reaction mixtures, combined with each of the three DNA fragments obtained in Example SA above and ligated with T4 DNA ligase as previously described. The DNA present in the reaction mixture was used to transform competent E. coli K12 294 URAL B 15625 by standard techniques Hershfield et al., 1974, Proc. Nat.Acad. Sci. USA 71 3455 3459 and the bacteria were then plated on LB plates Maniatis et al., 1982 containing 20 pg ml ampicillin and 5 pg ml tetracycline. Several tetracycline resistant colonies were selected and the plasmid DNA was isolated and designated pBRHtrp. The presence of the desired fragment was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. Plasmid pBRHtrp expresses B lactamase, imparting ampicillin resistance, and contains a DNA fragment which includes the tro promoter operator. The DNA fragment also codes for a first protein, designated LE , comprising a fusion of the first six amino acids of the trp leader and approximately the last third of the trp E polypeptide, a second protein designated D , corresponding to approximately the first half of the trp D polypeptide, and a third protein, coded for by the tetracycline resistance gene. C. Construction of Plasmid pSOM782 Plasmid pBRHtrp was digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme and the resulting fragment, isolated by PAGE and electroelution, was combined with EcoRIdigested plasmid pSOMil Itakura et al., 1977, Sci.198 1056, U.S. Patent No. 4,366,246, G.B. Patent Publication No. 2,007,676A . The mixture was ligated with T4DNA ligase and the resulting DNA transformed into E. coli K12 294 as previously described. Transformant bacteria were selected on ampicillin containing plates and the resulting ampicillin resistant colonies were screened by colony hybridization Gruenstein et al., 1975, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72 3951 3965 . The trp promoter operator containing fragment, isolated from pBRHtrp and then radioactively labelled with 32p, was used as a probe in the above procedure. Several colonies were shown to be positive by colony hybridization and were therefore selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated and the orientation of the inserted fragments was determined by restriction analysis using enzymes BslII and BamHI in double digestion. Colonies containing the desired plasmid with the trp promoter operator fragment in the proper orientation were grown in LB medium containing 10 pg ml ampicillin.The desired plasmid was designated pSOM7A2 and was used for subsequent constructions described below.D. Construction of Plasmid ptrp24 1. Construction of a Gene Fragment Coding for the Distal Regions of the LEs Polypeptide With BglII and EcoRI Restriction Sites Respectively at the 5 and 3 Ends of the Coding Strand Plasmid pSOM7A2 was HindIII digested followed by digestion. with lambda exonuclease a 5 to 3 exonuclease under conditions chosen so as to digest beyond the BqlII restriction site within the LE encoding region. About 20 pg of EindIII digested pSOM7A2 was dissolved in buffer 20mM glycine buffer, pH 9.6, lmM MgCl2, lmM mercaptoethanol . The resulting mixture was treated with 5 units of lambda exonuclease for 60 minutes at room temperature.The reaction mixture obtained was then phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, and ethanol precipitated. To create an EcoRI residue at the distal end of the LE gene fragment, a primer 32pCCTGTGCATGAT was synthesized by the improved phosphotriester method Crea et al., 1978 and hybridized to the single stranded end of the LE gene fragment resulting from lambda exonuclease digestion. The hybridization was performed by dissolving 20 pg of the lambda exonuclease treated HindIII digestion product of plasmid pSOM7A2 in 20 pl H2O and combining with 6 p1 of a solution containing approximately 80 picomoles of the 5 phosphorylated oligonucleotide described above. The synthetic fragment was hybridized to the 3 end of the LE coding sequence and the remaining single strand portion of the LE fragment was filled in by Klenow Polymerase I using dATP, dTTP, dGTP and dCTP. Klenow Polymerase I is the fragment obtained by proteolytic cleavage of DNA Polymerase I.It contains the 5 3 polymerlzing activity, the 3 5 exonucleolytic activity, but not the 5 3 exonucleolytic activity of the parental enzyme Kornberg, 1974, W. H. Freeman and Co., SFO, 98 . The reaction mixture was thus heated to 500C and let cool slowly to 10 C whereafter 4 pl of Klenow enzyme were added. After 15 minutes incubation at room temperature, followed by 30 minutes incubation at 370C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 pl of 0.25 molar EDTA. The reaction mixture was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, and ethanol precipitated. The DNA was subsequently cleaved with the restriction enzyme BqlII and the fragments were separated by PAGE. An autoradiogram obtained from the gel revealed a 32p labelled fragment of the expected length of approximately 470 bp, which was recovered by electroelution. As outlined, this fragment LE d has a BglII terminus and a blunt end coinciding with the beginning of the primer.2. Construction of Plasmid pThal Plasmid pThal was constructed by inserting a synthesized gene for thymosin alpha 1 into plasmid pBR322. The synthesis of the thymosin alpha 1 codingDNA involves the synthesis and subsequent ligation of the 16 oligonucleotides T1 through T16 that are indicated by the double headed arrows in Figure 11 of the accompanying drawings. A met ATG was inserted at the N terminus and the 5 ends were designed with single stranded cohesive termini to facilitate joining to plasmids cleaved with EcoRl and Basel. As can be readily appreciated, the BglII site in the center of the gene assists in the analysis of recombinant plasmids. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides T1 to T16 were synthesized by the modified phosphotriester method ofItakura et al., 1977 and Crea et al., 1978. The various oligodeoxyribonucleotides are shown below in Table 1.

Various nucleotide fragments that are used in the synthesis of T1S are numerically designated in the Figure. The abbreviations employed are as follows TPSTe, 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulforyltetrazole BSA, benzene sulfonic acid TLC, thin layer chromatography HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography DMT, 4,4 dimethoxytrityl CE, 2 cyanoethyl R, p chlorophenyl Bz, benzoyl An, anisoyl iBu, isobutryl Py, pyridine AcOR, acetic acid Et3N, triethylamine. The fully protected trideoxyribonucleotides 4 85 mg, 0.05 mmol and 2 180 mg, 0.1 mmol were deblocked at the 5 hydroxyls by treatment with 2 BSA in 7 3 v v chloroform methanol 10 and 20 ml, respectively for 10 minutes at OOC. Reactions were stopped by addition of saturated aqueous ammonium bicarbonate 2 ml , extracted with chloroform 25 ml and washed with water 2 x 10 ml . The organic layers were dried magnesium sulfate , concentrated to small volumes about 5 ml and precipitated by addition of petroleum ether 350 600C fraction . The colorless precipitates were collected by centrifugation and dried in a dessicator in vacuo to give 6 and 8, respectively, each homogeneous by silica gel tlc Merck 60 F254, chloroform methanol, 9 1 . Trimers 1 and 3 270 mg, 0.15 mmol 145 mg, 0.075 mmol were converted into their phosphodiesters 5 and 7 by treatment with triethylamine pyridine water 1 3 1, v v, 10 ml for 25 minutes at ambient temperature. Reagents were removed by rotary evaporation and the residues dried by repeated evaporations with anhydrous pyridine 3x 10 ml . Trimer 8 0.05 mmol and trimer 7 were combined with TPSTe 50 mg, 0.15 mmol in anhydrous pyridine 3 ml and the reaction mixture left in vacuo at ambient temperature for two hours. TLC analysis showed that 95 of the trimer 8 had been converted into hexamer product visualized by detection of the DMT group by spraying with 10 aqueous sulfuric acid and heating at 600C . The reaction was quenched by addition of water 1 ml and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure.After removal of pyridine by coevaporations with toluene, the hexamer was deblocked at the 5 position with 2 BSA 8 ml as described above for trimers 4 and 2. The product 10 was purified on a silica gel column Merck 60 H, 3.5 x 5 cm by step gradient elution with chloroform methanol 98 2 to 95 5, v v . Fractions containing product 10 were evaporated to dryness. Similarly, trimer 5 was coupled to 6 and the fully protected product directly purified on silica gel. This latter compound was deblocked at the 3 end by triethylamine pyridine water as described above to give fragment 9. Finally, hexamers 9 and 10 were coupled in anhydrous pyridine 2 ml with TPSTe 75 mg, 0.225 mmol as the condensing agent. Upon completion 4 hours, ambient temperature the mixture was rotary evaporated and the residue chromatographed on silica gel. Product 11 160 mg was obtained by precipitation with petroleum ether and appeared homogeneous on TLC. A portion of compound 11 20 mg in pyridine 0.5 ml was completely deblocked by treatment with concentrated ammonium hydroxide 7 ml, 8 hours, 600C and subsequent treatment in 80 acetic acid 15 minutes, ambient temperature .After evaporation of acetic acid, the solid residue was dissolved in 4 aqueous ammonium hydroxide v v, 4 ml and extracted with ethyl ether 3x2 ml . The aqueous phase was concentrated to 1 2 ml and a portion applied to HPLC for purification of 12. The fractions corresponding to the major peak were pooled ca. 2 A254 units and concentrated to about 5 ml. The final product 12 was desalted on Bio gel P 2 1.5 x 100 cm by elution with 20 aqueous ethanol, reduced to dryness and resuspended in water 200 p1 to give a solution ofA254 10. The sequence of 12 was confirmed by twodimensional sequence analysis. The complete thymosin alpha 1 gene was assembled from the 16 synthetic oligo nucleotides by methods previously described in detail for somatostatin Itakura et al., 1977 , insulin Goeddel et al., 1979 , and growth hormone Gqeddel et al., 1979, Nature 281 544 .Ten microgram quantities of oligonucleotides T2 throughT15 were quantitatively phosphorylated with p32 ATP New England Nuclear in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase Goeddel et al, 1979 , to give specific activities of approximately 1 Ci mmol. Radiolabelled fragments were purified by 20 polyacrylamide 7 M urea gel electrophoresis and sequences of the eluted fragments were verified by two dimensional electrophoresis homochromatography Jay et al., 1974,Nucleic Acids Res. 1 331 of partial snake venom digests. Fragments T1 and T16 were left unphosphorylated to minimize undesired polymerization during subsequent ligation reactions.These oligonucleotides 2 pg each were assembled in four groups of four fragments see figure 13 of the accompanying drawings , by T4 DNA ligase using published procedures Goeddel et al., 1979 . The reaction products were purified by gel electrophoresis on a 15 polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea Maxam and Gilbert, 1977, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.USA 71 3455 . The four isolated products were ligated together and the reaction mixture resolved by 10 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA in the size range of the thymosin alpha 1 gene 90 105 base pairs was electroeluted. Plasmid pBR322 0.5 pg was treated with BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and the fragments separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The large fragment was recovered from the gel by electroelution and subsequently ligated to the assembled synthetic DNA Goeddel et al., Nature 281 544 1979 .This mixture was used to transform E. coli K12 294.Five percent of the transformation mixture was plated onLB plates containing 20 pg ml ampicillin. The four ampicillin resistant colonies obtained were sensitive to tetracycline, suggesting insertion into the tetracycline resistance gene. Analysis of the plasmids from these four colonies showed that in each case the plasmid, designated pThal, contained a a BqlII site not found in pBR322 itself, thus indicating the presence of the thymosin alpha 1 gene as shown in Figure 11, and b a fragment of approximately 105 base pairs generated by BamHI EcoRI cleavage. The construction route for plasmid pThal not drawn to scale , is presented inFigure 13 of the accompanying drawings wherein the heavy dots indicate 5 phosphate groups.3. Reaction of Treated pThal and LE d Fragment The plasmid pThal contains a gene specifying ampicillin resistance and a structural gene specifying thymosin alpha 1 cloned at its 5 coding strand end into an EcoRI site and at its 3 end into a BamEl site. The thymo.sin gene contains a BglII site as well. To create a plasmid capable of accepting the LE d fragment prepared above, pTHal was EcoRI digested followed byKlenow polymerase I reaction with dTTP and dATP to blunt the EcoRI residues. BqlII digestion of the resulting product created a linear DNA fragment containing the gene for ampicillin resistance and, at its opposite ends, a sticky BglII residue and a blunt end.The resulting product could be recircularized by reaction with the LE d fragment containing a BII sticky end and a blunt end in the presence of T4 ligase to form the plasmid ptrp24. In doing so, an EcoRI site is recreated at the position where blunt end ligation occurred. E. Construction of Plasmid pSOM782A4 Successive digestion of ptrp24 with BglII andEcoRI, followed by PAGE and electroelution, yields a fragment having codons for the LE d polypeptide with aBglII sticky end and an EcoRI sticky end adjacent to its 3 coding terminus. The LE d fragment can be cloned into the BslII site of plasmid pSOM7A2 to form an LE polypeptide somatostatin fusion protein expressed under the control of the tryptophan promoter operator. To do so requires 1 partial EcoRI digestion of pSOM7A2 in order to cleave the EcoRI site distal to the tryptphan promoter operator, and 2 proper choice of the primer sequence in order to properly maintain the codon reading frame, and to recreate an EcoRI cleavage site. Thus, 16 pg of plasmid pSOM7A2 were diluted into 200 pl of buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 , 0.02 NP40 detergent, and 100 mM Nail, and treated with 0.5 units EcoRI. After 15 minutes at 370C, the reaction mixture was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and subsequently digested with BqlII. The larger resulting fragment was isolated by the PAGE procedure followed by electroelution. This fragment contains the codons LE p for the proximal end of the LE polypeptide, i.e., those upstream from the BglII site. This fragment was next ligated to the above LE d fragment in the presence ofT4 DNA ligase to form the plasmid pSOM7A24, which upon transformation into E. coli K12 294, efficiently produced a fusion protein consisting of the fully reconstituted LE polypeptide and somatostatin under the control of the tryptophan promoter operator.F. Construction of Linear DNA Having aPstI Residue at the 3 end and a BgIII Residue at its 5 End Bounding a Gene Specifying Tetracycline Resistance Plasmid pBR322 was HindIII digested and the protruding HindIII ends were digested with S1 nuclease.The S1 nuclease digestion involved treatment of 10 pg ofHindIII cleaved pBR322 in 30 p1 S1 buffer 0.3M NaCl, 1 mM ZnC12, 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 with 30Q units S1 nuclease for 30 minutes at 150C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 pl of 30X S1 nuclease stop solution 0.8M tris base, 50 mM EDETA . The mixture was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and then EcoRI digested as previously described.The resulting fragment, obtained by the PAGE procedure followed by electroelution, has an EcoRI sticky end and a blunt end whose coding strand begins with the nucleotide thymidine. The Sl digested HindIII residue beginning with thymidine can be joined to a Klenow PolymeraseI treated BqlII residue so as to reconstitute the Bg1II restriction site upon ligation. Therefore plasmid pSOM7A2, prepared inExample 5C, was BqlII digested and the resulting BqlII sticky ends were made double stranded by treatment withKlenow polymerase I using all four deoxynucleotide triphosphates. EcoRI cleavage of the resulting product, followed by PAGE and electroelution of the small fragment, yielded a linear piece of DNA containing the tryptophan promoter operator and codons of the LE proximal t sequence upstream from the BqlII site LE p . The product had an EcoRI end and a blunt end resulting from filling in the BglII site. However, the BglII site is reconstituted by ligation of the blunt end to the blunt end of the above Sl digested HindlIl fragment.Thus, the two fragments were ligated in the presence of T4 DNA ligase to form the recircularized plasmid pHKY10 which was propagated by transformation into competent E. coli K12 294 cells. Tetracycline resistant cells bearing the recombinant plasmid pHKY10 were selected and the plasmid DNA extracted. Digestion with BgllI and PstI, followed by isolation by the PAGE procedure and electroelution of the large fragment, yielded the desired linear piece of DNA having PstI andBqlII sticky ends.This DNA fragment, thus produced from pHKY10, contains the origin of replication and, therefore, is useful as a component in the construction of plasmid pHI7A4Al in which both the genes coding for the trp LE polypeptide fusion protein and the tetracycline resistance are controlled by the trp promoter operator.G. Construction of Linear DNA Having the trp Promoter Operator Plasmid pSOM7A2A4, prepared in Example 5E, was subjected to partial EcoRI digestion followed by PstI digestion. The resulting fragment contained the trp promoter operator and was isolated by the PAGE procedure followed by electroelution. Partial EcoRI digestion was necessary to obtain a fragment which was cleaved adjacent to the 5 end of the somatostatin gene but not cleaved at the EcoRI site present between the ampicillin resistance gene and the trp promoter operator. Ampicillin resistance lost by the PstI cut in the ampicillin resistance gene can be restored upon ligation with the final pHKY10 linear DNA derivative produced in Example SF above. H. Preparation of Synthetic Gene Coding for the 32 N Terminal Amino Acids of Proinsulin A series of 18 oligonucleotides, shown in. Table 2, were prepared as a first step in constructing a gene coding for the first 32 amino acids of proinsulin.The nucleotide sequence of the entire gene ultimately constructed is shown in Figure 14.

These olignucleotides were synthesized by the conventional method of Crea et al., 1978, J. Biol. Chem. 250 4592 and Itakura et al., 1975, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 97 7327.Some of the oligonucleotides were used for constructing a gene for the human insulin B chain previously described by Crea, et al., 1978 and Goeddel, et al, 1979. Two oligonucleotides B5 and B10 incorporate HPaII and terminal BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The terminal sites are particularly useful for purposes of cloning. The eight oligonucleotides H1 H8, used previously for constructing the left half of the human insulin B chain gene Goeddel, et al., 1979 , contain the coding sequence for the 1 13 amino acids of the B chain gene and an additional N terminal methionine. The right half of the B chain gene was constructed from oligonucleotides B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9 andB10 by ligation using T4 DNA ligase in substantial accordance with the teaching of Goeddel, et al., 1979.The resultant gene fragment codes for the 14 30 amino acid units of the human insulin B chain and the first arginine of the bridging chain. A HpaII restriction site is incorporated into the gene sequence in the same reading frame and location as the HpaII site in the human insulin gene. After purification of thé ligated gene fragment by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and after elution of the largest DNA band, the fragment was inserted into HindIII BamHI cleaved plasmid pBR322. The resultant piasmid, designated pB3, was inserted into E. coli K12 294 by transformation. The plasmid conferred resistance to antibiotics ampicillin and tetracycline and was found to contain the desired nucleotide sequence. Two fragments, a 58 base pair HindIII BamHI fragment of pB3 and a 46 base pair EcoRI HindIII fragment of pBHl disclosed in Goeddel, et al., 1979 , were ligated to produce a fragment having EcoRI and BamHI termini. This fragment was conventionally ligated intoEcoRI and BamHI restricted plasmid pBR322 and the resultant plasmid, designated pIB3, was then cloned intoE. coli K12 294. After conventional amplification and isolation, plasmid pIB3 was digested with EcoRI and B aII to produce a synthetic gene fragment Fragment 1, Figure l5 that codes for the N terminal proinsulin amino acids preceded by a methionine. The synthetic gene was isolated conventionally by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. I. Isolation of cDNA Coding for the 50 C Terminal Amino Acids of Human Proinsulin The scheme for obtaining the desired cDNA is presented in Figure 16 of the accompanying drawings. In accordance therewith, the DNA sequence pCCGGATCCGGTTT18T, which contained both a BamHI recognition sequence and a 3 polythymidylic acid tract of approximately 20 residues, was synthesized and used to prime AMV reverse transcriptase for cDNA synthesis. The primer was prepared using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase Enzo Biochem, 200 units with 1 pmoi of the BamHI decanucleotide in a reaction volume of 0.6 ml containing 1.5 x 10 4 mol TTP. The reaction was conducted at 37 C for 1 hour in the buffer system of Chang, et al., 1978,Nature 275 617. Human insulinoma tissue was provided by theInstitute fir Diabetesforschung, Muenchen, West Germany.Those skilled in the art understand that human insulinoma tissue is readily available and can be obtained from a number of other sources in the medical community. PolyA mRNA 2.5 pg of the human insulinoma tissue was isolated in substantial accordance with the procedure ofUllrich, et al., 1977, Science 196 1313 and then converted to double stranded cDNA in substantial accordance with the teaching of Wickens, et al., 1978, J. Biol.Chem. 253 2483. Thus, a reaction volume of 80 p1 containing 15 mM Tris HCl pH 8.3 at 420C , 21 mM KC1, 8 mM MgC12, 30 mM B mercaptoethanol, 2 mM of the primer dCCGGATCCGGTT18T, and 1 mM dNTPs was preincubated at OOC. After addition of AMV reverse transcriptase, the mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at 420C. The resultant RNA DNA was then denatured using conventional procedures. The complementary cDNA strand was synthesized in a reaction volume of 150 pl containing 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.3, 35 mM KC1, 4 mM MgCl2, 15 mM ss mercaptoethanol 1 mM dNTPs and 9 units of Klenow Polymerase I. The mixture was incubated at 150C for 90 minutes followed by 15 hours at 40C. S1 nuclease digestion was then performed for 2 hours at 370C using 1000 units of S1 nuclease Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, Indiana in substantial accordance with the teaching of Wickens, et al., 1978. The double stranded cDNA 0.37 pg was electrophoresed on an 8 polyacrylamide gel and DNA fragments larger than 500 base pairs were eluted.Oligodeoxycytidylic acid residues were added to the 3 ends of the fragments using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in substantial accordance with the procedure of Maizel, 1971, Meth. Virol. 5 180. The dC tailed cDNA fragments were then annealed to pBR322 that had first been digested with PstI restriction enzyme and then tailed with deoxyguanidylic acid using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli K12 294 and the resultant cells plated on LB and TET medium. Colonies resistant to tetracycline but sensitive to ampicillin were isolated and screened for plasmids that had three PstI restriction sites. Such a restriction pattern is indicative of the gene for proinsulin, Sures, et al., 1980, Science 208 57.One plasmid, designated as peel04, contained a 600 base pair insert, gave the anticipated PstI restriction pattern and contained aBamHI site between the 3 polyA and the polyGC introduced during the cDNA preparation. Some of the nucleotide sequence of the insert is shown in Figure 14. J Assembly of a Gene Coding for Human Proinsulin The scheme used for assembling a gene coding for human proinsulin is shown in Figure 15 of the accompanying drawings. The synthetic gene segment coding for the first 31 amino acids of proinsulin, fragment 1 inFigure 15, was recovered from 50 pg of plasmid pIB3 using the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and HDaII as described above. This fragment also contains the ATG sequence for methionine in place of the presequence of preproinsulin. The cDNA gene segment coding for amino acids 32 86, as well as the translation stop signal and the 3 untranslated region of the mRNA, was recovered from 40 pg of plasmid pHI104 by treatment first with BamHI and then H aII restriction enzymes. The two fragments were isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution. The gene fragments were joined by treatment with T4 DNA ligase in 20 p1 ligase buffer at 40C for 24 hours. The mixture was diluted with 50 p1 H2O, conventionally extracted with each of phenol and chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol. The resulting DNA was treated with BamHI andEcoRI restriction enzymes to regenerate these sites and remove gene polymers. The assembled proinsulin gene was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ligated using T4 DNA ligase to EcoRI and BamHI digested plasmid pBR322. The resulting DNA was used to transform E. coli K12 294 and then the resultant colonies were screened for tetracycline sensitivity and ampicillin resistance. Plasmid pHI3, isolated from one such colony, contained the desired proinsulin gene which was subsequently characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis.K. Construction of a Plasmid for Expression of a Chimeric Protein Containing Human Proinsulin The complete human proinsulin gene, including the N terminal codon that codes for methionine, was recovered from plasmid pHI3 by treatment with EcoRI andBamHI restriction enzymes. The desired fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and then ligated usingT4 DNA ligase to the plasmid pSOM72ss4 PstI EcoRI partial digest prepared in Example 5G and the larger of the PstI BglII fragments of plasmid pHKY10 prepared in Example 5F . Thus, about 1 pg of the complete human proinsulin gene with EcoRI and BamHI termini, 4 pg ofPstI EcoRI partial pSOM78ZA4 fragment, and about 1 pg of the PstI BglII fragment of pHKY10 were ligated at 40C. for 24 hours using T4 DNA ligase in ligation buffer. The ligated DNA mixture was used to transformE. coli K12 294. Colonies that grew on both ampicillin and tetracycline were selected and were found to contain the desired plasmid pHI7A4Al and to express a protein of the molecular weight expected of the trp LE proinsulin fusion. Plasmid pHI74Al, which expressed the aforementioned protein, was completely characterized as to the DNA sequence and restriction sites of both the incorporated gene and also the vector. Plasmid pHI7A4al is depicted in Figure 15 of the accompanying drawings and can be selected readily because of the restoration of ampicillin and tetracycline resistance.
