# Fuel cell power generation system and method of operating the same.

## Abstract
A fuel cell power generation system in which the temperature of fuel cells 10 is held constant irrespec tive of their load level, and waste energy is effectively recovered, that is, heat generated by the fuel cells 10 or a hydrogen producing device 40 is temporarily stored, thereby to absorb the fluctuations of generated heat attendant upon the load fluctuation of the fuel cells 10 and also to generate steam required in the hydrogen producing device 40 by the use of the stored heat. When the amount of heat generated by the cells 10 is small as in low load or stand by operation, the stored heat is used for heating so as to allow power to be generated immediately upon a load demand.
