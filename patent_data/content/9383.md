## Description
A Device for attachment of a resilient and or flexible tube onto a nipple nozzle or like connection This invention relates to a device for attachment of a resilient and or flexible tube onto a nipple, nozzle or like connection and to bleeding equipment for use therewith, The invention has particular application to the field of bleeding hydraulic equipment such as vehicle brakes and clutches for the attachment of a resilient and or flexible bleed tube onto a bleed nipple of a brake or slave cylinder. Up to the present time, there has only been marginal difficulty in attaching a resilient and or flexible tube to a bleed nipple of ordinary relatively 1O N7 pressure hydraulic equipment since the apparatus has usually used relatively large diameter tubes as there is only a relatively small pressure build up in the tllbes, even in bleeders incorporating a one way valve. However, difficulty has been experienced on a number of occasions due to the resilient and or flexible tube being hlo.m off the nipple and this is undesirable even when it happens only rarely.Also systems using a higher pressure in the hydraulic system can cause severe difficulties and in one of the improved forms of bleeding equipment proposed here, pressure build up is a serious problem which has to be overcome if its advantages arfD to be utilised. The invention seeks to enable a resilient and or flexible tube to be attached to a nipple, nozzle or like connection securely and in a simple and economical way. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for attachment of a resilient and or flexible tube onto a nipple, nozzle or like connection comprises a retaining element have an aperture therein of larger diameter than the tube with which it is intended to be used, the diameter of the aperture being large enough to pass over the tube when the tube is in position on the nipple, nozzle or like connection but small enough to cause the resilient and or flexible tube to grip the nozzle or like connection. Preferably the size of the aperture is such that the grip is sufficient to present the tube being forced off the nipple, nozzle or the like connection in normal use.The apertured element may comprise a flat plate like element with a suitably dimensioned hole there through. When the device is used in a brake clutch or the like bleeding device, a transparent tube may be inserted into the resilient and or flexible tube. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a brake, clutch or the like bleeding device comprising a flat retaining element having at least three apertures therein, a resilient and or flexible tube being threaded through first and second apertures in opposite directions and being connected to a transparent tube, threaded through the third aperture, at the second aperture and the first aperture being of a larger diameter than the resilient and or flexible tube, being large enough to pass over the resilient and or flexible tube when the tube is in position on a bleed nipple and being small enough to cause the resilient and or flexible tube to grip the bleed nipple. The resilient and or flexible tube may have a valve arrangement therein. The valve arrangement may comprise a valve forming means which provides and retains a bend in the resilient and or flexible tube sufficiently sharp to completely block the resilient and or flexible tube at normal atmospheric pressure. The advantage of the invention lies mainly in the security of the connection of the resilient and or flexible tube to the nipple, nozzle or like connection. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a view showing the use of a retaining element for prevention of the removal by accident of a bleeder from the bleed nipple Figure 2 is a diagrammatic sectional view of the action of the retaining element shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a view of a wire element use for forming a valve in a tube Figure 4 is a view of the wire element of Figure 3 in use Figure 5 and 6 are sectional views used to indicate the operation of the wire element valve shown in Figure 4 Figure 7 is a perspective view of a practical form of bleeding device using the principle of the retaining element of Figure 1 and the wire element of Figure 3 with the valve in use Figure 8 is a perspective view of the apparatus shown in Figure 7 but with wire element unclipped and the retaining element set up for a different size of bleed nipple, and Figure 9 is a perspective view showing how the retaining element of Figures 7 and 8 can be used to form a valve without the use of the wire element. Referring firstly to Figure 1, a device for attachment of a resilient and or flexible tube of a brake bleeder is shown with the tube connected to a bleed nipple.In this figure the device is indicated at 1, the resilient flexible tube is indicated at 2, attached to a transparent tube 3 and the bleed nipple is indicated at 4. The device 1 comprises a flat plate like element 5 having a first aperture 6 at one end and a small aperture 7 at the other end. As will be referred to particularly hereafter in connection with Figure 2, the aperture 6 is larger than the diameter of the tube 2 and is in fact large enough to pass over the head part of the bleed nipple 4 when the tube is pushed thereon. The flexible tube 2 is secured to the transparent tube 3 by pushing the transparent tube 3 into the flexible tube 2 and securing the two together by means of a wire clip 8. Suitably the wire clip 8 may also be used to secure the plate like element 5 to the brake bleeder, using the small aperture 7. A one way valve may be provided either at the end of the tube 3 or at an intermediate position thereof. If a small base transparent tube is used, the one way valve may not be necessary. The operation of the device will now be described with additional reference to Figure 2. For ease of illustration, the parts are shown in Figure 2 stretched out sideways, connection between the plate like element 5 and the bleeder not being shown. Before attaching the flexible tube 2 to the bleed nipple 4, whose head 9 can be seen in Figure 2, the platelike element 5 is pushed well back along the flexible tube 2 so that a section of the flexible tube 2 protudes from the aperture 6. Then the free end of the flexible tube is pushed over the head 9 of the bleed nipple 4 as far as it will go. Thereafter the plate like element is passed along the flexible tube 2 until it passes over the head 9 of the bleed nipple 4 to take up the position shown. This will cause the tube 2 to grip the nipple 4 and prevent significant bulging or spreading of the end of the flexible tube 2. The nipple is then unscrewed in the usual way and the brake pedal pumped to bleed the brakes. As can be seen from Figure 2, only the middle portion 10 of the flexible tube 2 can expand under pressure, as indicated by the arrows 11, the free end of the flexible tube being restrained by the edges of the aperture 6 in the plate like element 5. Thus no brake fluid can pass back around the head 9 of the bleed nipple 4, braking the seal between the flexible tube and the bleed nipple and allowing pressure to be taken up which might otherwise force the flexible tube 2 off the bleed nipple 4. The transparent tube 3 and or an extension thereof on the other side of the one way valve may have a very small internal diameter, of the order of 1 16 inch or less, and may extend to a length as required to bring the tube to a position which is visible to the operator. With a tube of this order, a stroke of the brake pedal can fill a length of tube of the order of 8 10 ft. Ignoring the brake fluid in the flexible tube 2 , with a small base tube of this length the valve is not usually necessary. One aperture 22 has a keyhold like shape and is open at 25 at one side of the element. This enables quick insertion and release of one part of the tube 23 which enables the valve to be opened out and effectively removed. Figure 5 shows the flexible tube 23 with the wire element 20 in the position which i t takes up when initially attached to a bleed nipple 27. A retaining element, for example as shown in Figures 1 and 2 is shown at 28. As can be seen, with no pressure present in the tube 23, the opposite sides 30 and 31 of the tzbe will be forced together by the sharpness of the curve in the tube and will effectively provide a shut off valve. Once pressure is applied to the tube e,g by the flow of brake or clutch fluid from the released nipple 27, the tube 23 will swell and will provide a passageway for the brake fluid 34 around the bend 24 as is shown in Figure 6. Once the pressure is removed the tube will return to its configuration as shown in Figure 5 and in this way will seal the brake system successfully. It will be observed that pressure in either direction will open the valve but this is of no significance since the only pressure which is sufficient to open the valve during a brake or clutc h bleeding operation is that o the brake fluid from the brake system the other side ef the valve usually being of atmospheric pressure. Figure 7 shows the use of the valve arrangement for a brake bleeding operation, a brake nipple being indicated at 35 and shown removed from the brake cylinder into which it is normally screwed. As can be seen, the full length of the tube 23 enables one end of the tube to be pushed over the nipple portion of the bleed nipple at 36, it being retained thereon by means of a strap member 37. The retaining strap 37 is provided with four apertures 38, 39, 40 and 41 in two pairs one aperture 38 of the apertures 38 and 39 at one end receiving a flexible tube 7 and one aperture 40 of the lower apertures 40 and 41 receiving the other end of the flexible tube 23. Into the lower end of the flexible tube 23 is connected a transparent tube 42 which is then passed back through the aperture 41 to assist in its retention.The tube 42 may be of any suitable length, perferably being a small bore tube 8 to 10 foot in length, the free end of which is suitably inserted into or connected to a container not shown for receiving brake or clutch fluid which is pumped out during a bleeding operation. The wire element 20 provides for a valve action in the tube 23 at 24. It is to be noted that the strap 37 is provided with two upper apertures 38 and 39, the aperture 38 being arranged to hold the tube 23 on the bleed nipple 35, the aperture 39 being unused in Figure 7. Suitably the two apertures 38 and 39 are of different sizes so that they can be used with different sizes of bleed nipple provided that sufficient stretch and flexibility is present in the tube 23. Thus figure 7 shows the use of the lower aperture 38 for a small bleed nipple 10 while figure 8 shows the use of the upper aperture 39 for a large bleed nipple 44. Figure 8 demonstrates the use of the open slotted portion 25 in the wire element 20 to enable the valve to be opened and the valve action provided at 24 to be dispensed with. This is useful in brake bleeding operations where the small bore tube is used as usually in this case the valve is not needed, the length of the tube being a sufficient safeguard against indrawn air. Thus the tube 23 is forced out of the slot 25 thus removing the restricted bend 24 and allowing full flow of fluid through the tube 23. As will be appreciated, when it is desired to return to the valve action, it is a simple matter to push the tube 23 back through the slot 25 into the aperture 22. As is usual in brake bleeding operations, the transparent tube 17 is preferably connected with a container or the like not shown for receiving the bleed fluid. Figure 9 shows the possibility of providing a valve using only the retaining element 37. In this case, the tube 23 is threaded through both of the upper apertures 38, 39 so as to provide the bend 24 in the tube 23 with the desired valve action. In this case the apertures 38 and 39 may be made of the same dimensions. To provide for use with different sizes of bleed nipple, three apertures could be provided, the upper aperture being, for example, smaller than the other two. Thus for larger nipples the middle and lower apertures would be used the middle aperture providing the retention on the nipple and for smaller nipples the middle and upper apertures would be used the upper aperture providing retention on the nipple. It will be appreciated that various modifications could be made to the above described embodiments without departing from the scope of the inventions For example, the wire valve element could be replaced by a suitable moulded or extruded plastics chip arrangement.Two of the valved resins could be used together on opposite of a tube for sapling purposes.
