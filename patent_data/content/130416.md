# A process for making an ohmic contact to an N type conductivity group III V semiconductor compound and a semiconductor device having such an ohmic contact.

## Abstract
An ohmic contact is made to an n type Group III V semiconductor compound eg gallium arsenide by vapour depositing germanium 3 and a refractory metal 4 select ed from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten and tantalum on to the substrate and sintering the substrate in a reducing atmosphere for a time and at a temperature sufficient to form the first to form germanide of the refrac tory metal. The resulting ohmic contact includes an inter face region of germanium heavily doped with the Group V element disposed between a region of the Group III to V compound doped with germanium and the layer of ger manide.
