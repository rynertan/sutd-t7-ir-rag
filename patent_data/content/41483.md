## Description
Electric wire coated with an adhesive and covered with electric tapi ,The present invention concerns an electric wire used in the manufacture of windings for motors, generators, transformers, inductors, etc. coated with an adhesive1 around which an electric tape is wound.Insulating conductors are already knows upon which the tape or the insulating tapes are applied by means of a simple winding upon the bare wire.These well known conductors involve some disadvantages in the manu facture of the coated conductor and during its use indeed the tape sticks to the wire imperfectly and forms wrinkles in corresphndence to the superimpositions, when the conductor is bent.Also the application of conductors covered with insulating adhesive tape has been tried neverthless bad results were obtained. Indeed it has been observed that the adhesive is usually removed by the insulating oil at least in part, polluting the oil itself, and that it undergoes thermal degradation. Moreover the production cycles of the adhesive insulating tape, and of the conductor covered with this, involve such difficulties that they turn out to be expensive, and, in particular1 it is difficult to cut a tape with parallel edges, as required for a good insulation.Consequently it appears that the directions suggested by the known technique were such as to make the invention more difficult.The conductor, object of the present invention, overcome the incon veniences of the pertinent known technique it allows an increase of the production and improves the quality of the finished goods.Other advantages will be clear to those skilled in the art, as speci field in the following description.The electric conductor object of the present invention is coated with an adhesive and it is covered on the coating so obtained with insulating tape wound spirally with partially superimposed edges.Conductors of this type may have circular or polygonal section avid, in particular, they may be made of alwn iniuin, copper or other metals.The conductors with circular section have generally sections between 2 0,8 and 10 mm , while the conductors with polygonal section have sec 2 tions between 3 and 200 mm . The insulating tapes made of paper may consist of cellulose paper or synthetic organic material or mixed material, that is, cellulose with addition of synthetic organic material.Among the synthetic organic materials on the market, the Nomex type, an aromatic polyamide rSu Pont trade mark is preferred among the materials of the mixed type, the Tecwrap Tecnoconvert trade mark is preferred.Usually the tapes have thickness between 5 and 100 microns and up to 60 superimposed tapes can be applied.The adhesive nosed to this purpose must stand the contact with mineral oil up to 130 C or, if used under dry conditions, up to 250 C, without inconveniences.The following adhesives were found to be satisfactory the polyurethan, epoxy and vinyl ones, but certainly others can be used successfully.The following table shows clearly the mechanical superiority of the conductor taped with paper stuck on the conductor, oompared with the one taped with paper without glueing. TABLEBehaviour under traction of a wire covered with paper. Paper wound around a wire of aluminium coated with an adhesive the paper breaks when the aluminium wire exceeds the maximum tensile stress, which occurs with an ultimate elongation of 2 o Paper wound around a copper wire coated with an adhesive the paper breaks when the elongation of the copper wire reaches 23 . Paper merely wound around an aluminium wire and, respectively, a copper wire the paper comes off when the elongation of the aluminium and 4l the copper reaches 5 .As it can be expected, also the insulation characteristics of the conductor of the present invention are superior to the characteristics, which can be obtained with a tape merely wound without adhesive indeed, for example, the insulation of a conductor having only one tape stuck on itself is about the same as that of an insulated conductor having two insulating tapes merely wound on itself.
