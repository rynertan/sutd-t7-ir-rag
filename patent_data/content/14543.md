# Surge voltage arrester with ventsafe feature.

## Abstract
A surge voltage arrester assembly comprises a primary gas tube surge arrester 22 and an air gap secondary arrester that provides surge protection should the gas tube become vented to atmosphere. The secondary arrester has the air gap 42 defined by a rim 40 of one of the gas tube electrodes and a metallic cup 36 into which the gas tube is positioned. In a three element version of the invention wherein the gas tube has two line electrodes 70, 70 and a ground electrode 72 , metallic cups 80,80 are provided at opposite ends of the gas tube to cooperate with the ground electrode for forming sec ondary air gaps 86 for each line electrodes. An O ring 53,88 and a sealing compound 90 seals each secondary air gap 86 against the entrance of contaminants.
