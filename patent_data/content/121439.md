# Tris dialkylamino sulfonium bifluoride catalysts.

## Abstract
Tris dialkylamino sulfonium bifluoride salts are obtained by hydrolysis, methanolysis, or pyrolysis of corresponding tris dialkylamino sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicates, reac tion of dialkylaminotrialkylsilanes with sulphur tetrafluoride, or reaction of bis dialkylamino sulfur difluorides with dialkyl amines. These bifluoride salts, which have the general for mula R¹R²N R³R⁴N R⁵R⁶N S
