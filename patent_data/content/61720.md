# Process for the selective aliphatic chlorination of alkylbenzenes.

## Abstract
Alpha chlorinated cumene derivatives are prepared by chlorinating cumene derivatives in the presence of light. The chlorination may be taken to 100 percent conversion when performed in a solvent, e.g., m dichlorobenzene.
