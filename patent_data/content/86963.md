# Injection molding valve pin direct pneumatic actuator.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a valve gated injection molding system of the type where the melt passage enters the system on general alignment with the valve pin and cavity. The system has a novel valve pin actuating mechanism which is pneumatically operated according to a predetermined timed cycle. A pision 62 which reciprocates in a cylinder 64 has an outer collar portion 66 from which a tongue portion 68 extends inwardly to operatively engage the driven end 38 of the valve pin 36 . The melt passage extends through a portion of the back plate 22 which, in turn, extends through the outer collar portion 66 of the piston 62 and is offset to leave room for the tongue portion 68 of the piston 62 to engage the driven end 38 of the valve pin 36 . Piston rings 84, 86 are located between the piston 62 , back plate 22 and cylinder 64 to prevent excessive air leakage. This center entry system with a pneumatic actuating mechanism pro vides a more reliable mechanism which may be double acting.
