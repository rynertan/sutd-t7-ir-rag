# Tire tread compound.

## Abstract
A predominantly styrene butadiene copolymer rubber SBR tire tread compound bay be reinforced with a special high structure carbon black designated herein as a N103, having a relatively high volatiles content as indicated by its iodine number , and a superfine particle size smaller than about 20 nanometers nm , a DBPA greater than 120 cm³ 100 g carbon black, and an I₂ No in the range from 130 160 mg g, in an oil extended tread compound in which there is at least 30 parts of processing oil per 100 parts of rubber the presence of this N103 black in a major amount relative to the total amount of high structure black, is essential.
