# Control circuit for semiconductor element with control electrode.

## Abstract
A control circuit for a semiconductor element with a control electrode includes a signal transmission circuit 30, 31 , in which two switching elements 2, 4 made conductive when a control signal is supplied from a control signal source 35 to the switching elements 2, 4 through a signal insulating element 1 , are provided so that the control signal is transferred to a turn on circuit 40 for the semi conductor element only when the switching elements 2, 4 are simultaneously made conductive.
