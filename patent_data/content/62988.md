## Description
DESCRIPTION PAPER PULPED The present invention relates to a paper pulper, particularly for the treatment of waste paper to produce useable stock or slush pulp therefrom. It is an object of the present invention to provide a paper pulper requiring less energy and being more effective in breaking up or separating onto any synthetic plastics materials, foils or other extraneous matter that may be contained in the feedstock, than pulpers hitherto provided. The pulper of the invention is designed to receive waste paper from openei bales from which heavy and large contaminants have been removed, and to maintain the size of contaminants to facilitate their removal. According to the present invention, a paper pulper comprises a driable, rotatable drum 2 containing an independently rotatable roller of lesser axial length eccentrically located therein, wherein paper to be pulped is Ted through the nip between the drum and the roller, and is characterised in that the drum is orientated with its longitudinal axis. lying in an inclined plane, and that the internal surface of the drum, over at least the axial extent 8 corresponding to the roller 20 , and the external surface of the roller are provided with abrading discontinuities 10,24 .The drum and the roller are rotated relative to one another to cause paper passing into the nip to be submitted to a shearing, tearing or abrading action. The term 1,roller as used in this specification is intended to comprehend within its scope a hollow body, i.e. a drum. The shearing action tears and disintegrates the paper and ,F e disintegred bits form a pulp with added water and consequently nay b wasned out of the drum as pulp by spraying water into the drum. The paper feed stock may be moistened before or after introduction into the drum, and it is preferably maintained in a moist condition after input into the drum to assist in disintegration of the paper. Accordingly, the pulper may be provided with means for spraying water thereinto preferably arranged so that the addition of water can be controlled at two or more locations in thelength of the pulper. The means may introduce the water at either or both ends of the pulper, and may be arranged to operate either intermittently or continuously. To facilitate throughput and drainage, the drum is arranged to incline downwardly from the input end, i.e. the end at which the paper feedstock is introduced, and may be formed to extend in an axial direction beyond the end of the roller remote from said input end and to provide in the extended portion of the drum a series of circumferentially spaced holes to permit the pulp to drain from the drum. The holes may be dimensioned to prevent passage therethrough of extraneous material such as pieces of plastics material, Since the input used will usually be waste paper, the paper fed into the pulper may easily contain such extraneous material unless such material is first removed. The holes may be in the form of slots. The downstream end of the drum may be open so that any extraneous material present passes out thereat. It is also preferred that the roller itself be in the form of a drum closed at each end and that it provide means for introducing liquid into the drum and removing it therefrom so tat the weight of the roller may be varied. The present invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawing, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal vertical cross sectional view of a paper pulper according to the present invention, and Figure 2 is a transverse cross sectional view of the pulper of Figure 1, taken along the line II II of that Figure. Referring to the drawing, the pulper comprises a rotatable drum 2, orientated to lie, with its longitudinal axis inclined, on a pair of rollers 4 adjacent the uppermost end of the drum and a pair of rollers 6, adjacent the lowermost end of the drum. At least one of the rollers in each pair is driven, and by means of a friction drive the drum 2 is thereby rotated. On its interior surface, the drum, over a section 8 of its length extending from its uppermost end, is formed with a serrated surface 10 and this is followed by a further section 12 of its length comprising stock outlet holes in the form of slots 14 spaced around the circumference and extending through the shell of the drum. The section 12 comprising the slots terminates well short of the lowermost end 16 of the drum, which is formed with that end open. The uppermost end 18 of the drum may have an end wall not shown in which case it is apertured to give access to the drum interior. Located eccentrically within drum 2 is a roller 20 which is preferably also in the form a drum, the axial length of which is somewhat less than that of section 8 of the drum. Roller 20, when no feedstock is present in drum 2, is supported on the serrated interior surface 10 of section 8 of the drum. In order to maintain the axial position of roller 20 within drum 2, the former is tethered in any suitable manner, such as by a chain and swivel mechanism 22, to some fixed point. The exterior surface of the roller is formed with serrations 24 in a like manner to that of the interior surface of section 8 of the drum 2. In use of the pulper, paper feedstock is fed into the uppermost end 18 of the drum, while the latter is rotated by the friction drive provided by the driven ones of rollers 4,6. This causes the roller 20 to roll on the drum interior and to draw feedstock into the nip formed between the serrations 24 of the roller 20 and those 10 of the drum 2 interior the stock being sheared as it passes through the nip. The inclination of the pulper causes the paper feedstock to be fed forward under the action of gravity, the feedstock being repeatedly passed through the nip. This causes the stock to be comminuted and to disintegrate.Compression of the feedstock at the output side of the nip takes place on rotation of the drum and roller and this also gives rise to some amount of abrasion and disintegration of the stock. The disintegrated stock or slush pulp is formed into a pulp by water sprayed into the drum by sprays 26 leading into the drum 2 through the apertured upper end 18 or introduced at any other convenient point The watered and comminuted pulp then flows into drum section 12 to exit through the slots 14 therein into any suitable receptacle 28. The slots 14 are dimensioned to prevent exit of pieces of non disintegrated material 30 resulting from the inclusion in the feedstock of extraneous material such as pieces of synthetic plastics material, metal foil, wet strengthened paper or other impurities, from passing through, and such material is carried on to exit at the open bottom end 16 of the drum 2. Alternatively, the feedstock may be cleansed of such material before input to the pulper.A doctor not shown may be used to clear the slots 14 of any pieces of extraneous material 30 that become lodged therein. Preferably, the feedstock is moistened to a 6 to 35 consistency for treatment in the pulper. This may be done in the pulper, but the feedstock may also be wetted, at least with part of the water required, before introduction into the pulper. Treatment agents may be added to the water, such as a bleach or ink dispersing agent. Although the illustrated pulper employs serrated surfaces to effect the shearing action, other formations such as a scroll or indentations may be used, and it may be preferable for different configurations to be used on the drum 2 and roller 20 respectively. The illustrated embodiment also shows the roller 20 as one which is freely rotated by rolling on the interior of the drum, but it may, in the alternative, be positively driven or be braked so that its rotational speed is not determined, or wholly determined, by the speed of rotation of the drum 2. Further, two or more rollers 20 tethered together in series may be employed and it is preferred in the case wherein the or each roller 20 is constituted by a drum, that the or each drum is capable of having liquid introduced into or removed from it so that the weight of the rollers 20 may be varied to suit different operating requirements. In this way, the pressures applied to the wetted paper by the rolling surfaces can be adjusted by varying the inner roll 20 mass. Conveniently the angle of inclination of drum 2 can be varied as can its speed of rotation. In this way the time of treatment of stocks passing therethrough can be adjusted to suit requirements dictated by the nature of the feedstock and the required quality of the disintegrated stock or slush pulp .
