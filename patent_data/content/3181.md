# Process for closing a flexible receptacle and closed receptacle.

## Abstract
To provide a hermetic seal for flexible receptacles such as plastic bags, pouches, or casings, the outside of the mouth 11 of the receptacle is coated with a cold flowing resin so that when the receptacle is filled and its mouth 11 gathered under pressure the resin will cold flow and fill the voids in the gathered folds. Preferably, the end of the gathered mouth 11 is trimmed and then high pressure is applied to cause the resin 10 to exude from the trimmed end. Next, a moulding plunger 9 is used to press the exudate into a smooth surface whereby a fused cap of resin is formed hermetically closing the bag s mouth 11 . As an alternative, a clip or band can be placed around the gathered end under sufficient pressure to cause cold flow of the resin thereby sealing the voids.
