# Improved go back N automatic repeat request communication systems.

## Abstract
A go back n automatic repeat request communication system is improved by resending a correcting code corres ponding to failed data rather than just resending the failed data. Further improvement is obtained by using either a half rate invertible code or, for a bursty system a burst code. Still further improvement is obtained by using a resend slots corresponding to good data to send code forms correspond ing to the longest outstanding failed data. It is preferred to generate and buffer the current N code forms at the transmitter and to buffer the N data units starting at the earliest failed data unit at the receiver, the receiver including correcting logic.
