## Description
A SAF TY GARMENT The present invention relates to a safety garment for providing buoyancy to its weUrt r in an emergency, which Is particularly suitable for people involved in water sports, or working aboard ships o close to waterways. The garment is comfortable and convenient to wear. Various different types of life saving garments are available, some of which are provided in the forir of a jacket having pouches for receiving buoyant materials and whi.ch act only to provide an assistance to the wearer in keeping afloat, whilst other devices have one or more inflatable buoyancy bags. These inflatable devices are either in thc form of a yoke like collar which the user places over his heaG and secures by means of a belt round his waist, or in the form of a jacket or full length, one piec0, waterproof suit, wherein inflatable buoyancy bags are provided as to form a yoke like collar. With these various inflatable buoyancy arrangements, inflation may be performed by the wearer blowing into a mouthpiece conveniently located for this purpose, or by means of a cylinder of compressed gas provided for the purpose. The various above mentioned garments are generally quite satisfactory for maintaining a person afloat, but are cumbersome and inconvenient, due to the fact that thcy ounally have to m worn eternally to other clnthing worn by the user to allow zccess to the mouthplece, or to the release for the ges bottle, for inflntion of the buoyancy bags.Further, when in use1 they are at risk of being daniaged by the rigging or fittings, for example, on a yacht. FurLher more, a person having such a lifeiacket would, when going ashore, tend to leave his life jscket behind so as to avoid having to carry it around whilst ashore, thins placing his own life at risk since many accidents occur in travelling in a small dinghy or skiff from a moored yacht to shore. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide a safety garnlent for providing buoyancy for its wearer to maintain him afloat, which is combined with a jacket in such a manner that the inflatable buoyancy aid, which is preferably in the form of a substantially yoke shaped bag, is invisible externally, and can be worn with safety and comfort, but is readily accessible and inflatable in the event of an emergency. According to the present invention there is provided a safety garment for provi.diBgbuoyancy to its wearer to keep him afloat, comprising a jacket having an inflatable stole secured thereto and located inside the jacket, the stole having two limbs extending down the front of the jacket, and the limbs being joined around the collar region, and a belt secured to and encompassing the lower part of the stole and passing around the body in use. With this arrangement the stole may be partially inflated and the belt may be fastened around it, the belt being worn loose under normal circumstances. This arrangement is comfortable and the jacket mav be worn unfastened. If the wearer should fall over board, the stole is prevented by the arm holes of the jacket from riding up over his head arid is prevepted by the belt from floating up from his body. Thus, sufficient flotation is achieved to allow the stole to be fully inflated. The belt will be tight around the fully inflated stole and will hold the stole firmly for full long term support. Preferably the belt is fixed to the outside of one limb of the stole and is slidable in a retainer on the outside of the other limb. Preferably the garment comprises two waterproof layers with the stole accommodated between them. The belt also may pass between the layers ot the jacket, the two ends of the belt emerging through the inner lining layer of th jacket, in the region of the front fasteners of the jacket, where they may be fastened together by means of a buckle of suitable type.To enable access to the mouthpiece for in flating the stole, an aperture is provided in the inner lining of the jacket, near the collar, through which the mouthpiece projects, and preferably, a flap is provided on the inner lining which covers the mouthpiece when not in use, but which can be easily opcned, for example using a Velcro RUl fastening means, when it is required to inflate the stole. The jacket may be of conventional type, but is preferably of a lightweight waterproof material and may be provided with pockets as required. Further, a I1ood may be provided in the collar of the Jacket if detired. The presert invention will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates the extenial appearance of a jacket incorporating a stole in accordance with the present invention Figure 1A illustrates the manner in which the mouthpiece of the stole is accessible under a flap inside the front of the jacket Figure 2 illustrates the shape of the stole and Figure 3 illustrates the positioning cif the stole within a jacket of the type shown inFigure 1. As shown in the drawings, a jacket 1 incorporatirg a stole 2 in accordance with the present invention is of normal appearance and the incorporation of a stole 2 is totally invisible externally. The stole 2 provided within the jacket 1 is illustrated inFigure 2 and is formed of a conventional shape having two large front limbs 3 and 4 joined together by a collar portion 5 which extends behind the collar of the jacket 1.The stole 2 is inflatable by means of a mouthpiece 6 which is positioned so as to be readily accessible to the wearer in the case of an emergency, and as illustrated in Figure la the mouthpiece 6 may be accommodated in a pocket 9 provided in the inside lining of the jacket, which pocket 9 may be closable by means of, for example, a Velcro strip fastener 10 so as to be readily accessible in Lhe event of an emergency. Alternatively, a cylinder of compressed gas could be provided for the purposes of inflation, in which case an additional pocket would be provided in the inside lining of the jacket 1 to accommodate such a cylinder. A belt 7 is provided which is fixed by bonding to the limb 3 and which is slidably attached to limb 4 by means of a belt loop 8. The ends of the belt 7 pass out through slits provided in the inside layer cf the jacket to enable the belt 7 t be fastened by means of a buckle 11. The stole 2 can be positicned between the inner and outer layers of the jacket 1 and secured in position by any suitable means, such as loops Se cured by press studs, or by Velcro strips, and the stole 2 is readily accessible for inspection for leaks, or for removal and replacement, in that the inner and outer layers are not stitched together at the bottom hem but are fastened together by a plurality of fastening means such as Velcro strips or press studs. The jacket 1 may be provided with any number of pockets as required and a hood may be provided in the collar of the jacket, as is known. The position of the stole 2 within a jacket 1 can be seen fromFigure 3, in that the two front limbs 3 and 4 of the stole 2 pass down between the inner and outer layers of the front panels of the jacket 2 whilst the portion 5 extends behind the collar of the jacket 1. When inflated, this arrangement ensures thdt tht wearer is maintained in a face up position with his head supported out of the water by means of the portion 5 behind the collar. As can be readily seen, the present invention provides a jacket which can be worn at any time with olit anyone other that the wearer being aware that it incorporates a life jacket so that it can be worn ashore without embarrasement, whilst ensuring that tit wearer is protected against drowning. Further, since the stole 2 is positioned within a jacket, the stole 2 is additionally protected against damage since it is covered by the outer layer of the jacket. The jacket can be provided in a variety of styles providing sufficient allowance is uade for the ex pans ion of the buoyancy stole following infintion thereof, so that a presentable garment is provided which may induce persons to wear the jacket whereas t hey may not have done so in the case of a conventional life jacket.
