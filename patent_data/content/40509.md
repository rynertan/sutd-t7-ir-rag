# Linear motor.

## Abstract
A linear motor comprises an armature 14,15,16 and a stator 11,12 each adapted to provide a sequence of North and South poles along the length of the motor. The pole pitch of the stator magnets is different from that of the armature coils 15,16 such that with appropriate energisation of the coils this difference in pole pitch and stator can result in a net thrust of the armature relative to the stator in a desired direc tion at any location within a range of relative longitudinal positions of the armature and stator. The motor may be sub ject to closed loop velocity and or positional control and means are disclosed to achieve this. Several variations in pole configurations and means of controlling the coil energisation are disclosed.
