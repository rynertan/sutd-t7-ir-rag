# Polyurethane RIM system.

## Abstract
A polyurethane RIM system has at least two molding stations. The reactants are brought to the mixheads as three separate streams. One stream contains the isocyanate, the second stream contains some of the polyol, the chain extender and crosslinker and a third stream contains addi tional amounts of the polyol, along with what additives might be desired. At each mixhead the proportions of ingredients are controlled to give an isocyanate index of about 100, but the ratio of one polyol stream to the other is regulated to control the flex modulus and other properties of the molded product as may be desired. In this way, one source of supply can be used to feed several molding stations, each of which may produce a product of different physical properties and thus of different costs.
