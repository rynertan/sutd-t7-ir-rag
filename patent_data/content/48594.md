## Description
COMBINATION OF PHENOLIC ANTlOXID ANT AND STABILIZER FOR USE IN ORGANIC MATERIAL This invention relates to a combination of antioxidant and stabilizer for organic materials. More particularly the invention relates to stabilizing compositions comprising a mixture of A the phenolic antioxidant N,Ntbis 2 3 j3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyll propionyloxy el hylloxarnide with one of the following stabilizers B1 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzoph enone B2 2 2, 5 di t butyl 2 hydroxypheny i 5 cMorobenzo triazole or B3 N hydroxyethyl 2 ,2, 6, 6 tetramethylpiperidino succin ic acid ester. The protection of organic materials, especially polymers, normally subject to deterioration over a period of time by exposure to such adverse influences as the weather especially ul traviolet light , by the addition of various antioxidants and stabilizers has previously been known, but it has been desired to provide more satisfactory protection in an economical and convenient manner. Typical prior stabilization practices are illustrated in CanadianSerial No. 318,249, Hirsch et awl., Dec. 20, 1978 U. S. patents 2,154,723, Hirsch et al, May 15, 1979 4,187,212 Zinka et al, Feb 5, 1980 and 4,104,248, Cantatore, Aug. 1, 1978. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that a remarkably high level of protection is achieved by employing a combination of the phenolic antioxidant A described above with one of the stabilizers B described above, as the stabilizer system. The phenolic antioxidant A and the stabilizers B described above employed in the stabilizing mixtures of the invention are known materials. The ratio of phenolic antioxidant compound A to stabilizer compound B employed in the mixed stabilizer composition of invention may vary widely, for example from 1 9 to 9 1, preferably from 2 8 to 8 2, and more preferably from 4 6 to 6 4, by weight. To stabilize an organic material in accordance with the invention the material is mixed by any suitable conventional means, with the phenolic antioxidant compound A and one of the described stabilizer compounds B , separately or together, in a stabilizingly effective amount. Remarkably small quantities of the mixed stabil izer composition of the invention are effective, e.g., from 0 005 or less to 5 or more, preferably from 0.05 to r, more preferably from 01 to 0. 5 , based on the weight of the material to be stabilized.The optimum amount id aiiy given case will depend on such variables as the degree of stabilization desired, the particular material being stabilized, etc. and is readily determinable with the aid of standard tests for evaluating stabilizers in various materials. If desired, the stabilizer composition of the invention can be employed in combination with other stabilizers, e. g. dilauryl or distearyl beta thiodipropionate, antiozonants, thermal stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers and or with coloring materials, dyes, pigments, metal chelating agents, etc. The organic materials which can be stabilized in accordance with this invention by admixing with phenolic antioxidant A and stabilizer B include polyolefins which can be homopolymers of unsubstituted olefinic hydrocarbons such as, e.g. ethylene, propylene, 1 butylene , 1 ,3 butadiene and styrene, homopolb mers of substituted olefinic hydrocarbons such as, e.g. vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride and esters such as acetate, vinyl alcohols, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, or copolymers of two or more of such stubstituted and or unsubstituted olefinic hydrocarbons.Also included are condensation polymers such as, e. g. polyalkylene oxides, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates and polyamides such as polyhexamethylene adipamide and polycaprolactam. Other organic materials which can be stabilized by this invention include lubricating oils, e.g. of the aliphatic ester type such as di 2 ethylhexyl azelate and pentaerythritol tetracaprolate, animal and vegetable derived oils such as linseed oil, fat, tallow, lard, peanut oil, cod liver oil, castor oil, palm oil, corn oil and cottonseed oil, fatty acids such as soaps, and other hydrocarbon material such as gasoline, mineral oil, fuel oil, drying oil, cutting fluids and waxes. It is possible with the stabilizer mixture according to the invention to stabilize, for example, the following polyolefins 1. polymers that are derived from singly unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as polyolefins, e.g. polyethylene of low and high density, which can optionally be crosslinked, poly propylene, polyisobutylene, polymethylbutene 1 and poly rnethylphentene 1 2. mixtures of the homopolymars mentioned under 1, such as mixtures of polypropylene and polyethylene, poly propylehe and polybutene 1, polypropylene and polyisobu ethylene 3. copolymers of the monomers on which the homopoly mers mentioned under 1 are based, such as ethylene propylene copolymers, propylene butene 1 copolymers, propylene isobu tylene copolymers, ethylene butene 1 copolymers, as well as terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with a diene, such as hexadiene, di cyclopentadiene or ethylid enenorbornene. The following examples, in which all quantities are expressed by weight unless otherwise indicated, will serve to illustrate the practice of the invention in more detail. Example 1 This example illustrates the stabilization of polypropylene resin with a combination of phenolic antioxidant and stabilizer identified as follows in Table I Phenolic antioxidant A N,N bis 12 3 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl J propionyl oxy ethyl oxamide, BPEO . Stabilizer B1 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenone, HOBP . The effectiveness of the stabilizer combinations is evaluated by observing changes in ultimate tensile strength upon prolonged exposure to simulated outdoor weathering conditions. Control stock containing no stabilizer Run 1 in Table l , or the phenolic antioxidant component alone or stabilizer component alone Runs 2 and 3 in Table I are included for comparison with a stock of the invention containing both the phenolic antioxidant A and the stabilizer B Run 4 in Table I . The stocks represented in Table I are prepared by dry mixing in a Hobart trademark mixer 100 parts of unstabilized powdered polypropylene average molecular weight about 72,000 Profax 6501 ltrademark with 0.1 part of the phenolic antioxidant A and 0.3 part of the stabilizer B1. The mixtures are extruded on aDavis Standard trademark extruder containing three screens 60 80 100 mesh and a 3 4 bar die length to diameter ratio 30 1 . The extrusion is conducted with the following temperature profile feed 1930 transition 1970, 2040 metering 2100, 2150 and die 2210C at 20 RPM.The extrudate is chopped and injection molded on an Ankerwerke trademark machine with rear, middle and front temperatures of 182 C, mold temperature at 52 C, intoT bars of dimensions 8 long by 1 8 thick by wide. TheT bars are aged in an Atlas Sunshine Arc Weatherometer trademark model XW W with conditions 63 C spray mist rate of 18 minutes every 2 hours. The samples are tested for tensile strength at break according to ASTM D638 Type I, dumbell specimens at a rate of 2 per minute. The results after 1200 hours exposure are shown in Table I. The data in Table I indicate the marked improvement in retained tentile strength using the antioxidant stabilizer in the combination of this invention rather than alone.
