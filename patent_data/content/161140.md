# Rate scanning demand pacemaker and method for treatment of tachycardia.

## Abstract
A self adapting demand pacemaker that recognizes the tachycardia from the intrinsic signals and initiates treatment in the following manner First, the escape interval of the demand pacemaker is shortened to be identical to the cycle length of the tachycardia, then to overdrive the tachycardia the pacemaker escape interval is continuously shortened with each subsequent beat, for a predetermined number of beats, by a small programmable decrement. Thereafter, the escape interval is restored to its original value and protects against a potential bradycardia. It has to be emphasized that the pacemaker remains in demand mode all of the time thus stimulation in a vulnerable zone is prevented and some of the hazards that accompany overdrive pacing are reduced. An additional advantage of this treatment is that since each stimulus is delivered only a few milliseconds before the next intrinsic depolarization is expected to arrive at the site of the electrode, it facilitates capture even when the excitable in terval is extremely short.
