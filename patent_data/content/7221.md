# Method and apparatus for patterning fabric having a thermoplastic pile.

## Abstract
Pile fabric 10 with thermoplastic pile is fed beneath a radiant heater 14, preferably with the pile brushed back by a brush 40. The files pulled back over a blade 16 so as to contact a cool pattern roller 18 having rows of thin blades in longitud inal slots at its periphery. The blades pattern the softened pile which is then set by the cool roller and air jet 32 directed on the back of the fabric. The fabric itself rotates the roller which may be braked friction brake34,36,38 . The apparatus and the method embodied in the apparatus can produce a stria pile fabric simulating a fabric produced with slubbed yarns. How ever the invention can be used whether the fabric is woven, tufted or knitted.
