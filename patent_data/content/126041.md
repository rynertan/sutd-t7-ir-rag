# Percussion tool.

## Abstract
A power operated percussion tool in which a shoulder 28 in the tool housing 10, 17 defines a rear rest position for a working implement 12 attached to the tool, and in which an energy absorbing bias unit 23, 31 is arranged to resiliently load the working implement 12 toward the rest position. The bias unit 23, 31 comprises a spring 23 and a shock wave mitigating ring assembly 31 and acts between a rearwardly facing shoulder 22 in the housing 10, 17 and a forwardly facing shoulder 30 on the working implement 12 . The ring assembly 31 includes two spring steel rings 32, 33 formed with mating conical contact surfaces for transforming axial load variations into radial deformation of the rings 32, 33 .
