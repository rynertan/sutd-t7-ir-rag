# Fiber optic connector.

## Abstract
An optical connector 10 for coupling a semiconductor light source 46, 46 to an optical fiber transmission line 12 . A light source such as a light emitting diode is mounted on a movable post 52, 52 within a housing 34 in juxtaposition to the end of an optical fiber 12 centered within a channel in a connector housing 14 . The optical fiber is held stationary whereas the post supporting the light emitting diode is moved by a probe inserted through multiple aligning ports 54 , until the diode is properly positioned for optimum light coupling into the fiber.
