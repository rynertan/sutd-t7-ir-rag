# CURRENT LIMITING CIRCUIT BREAKER HAVING AN IMPROVED CONTACT ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
In a current limiting circuit breaker, containing a pair of electrical contacts within separate chambers arranged side by side and isolated by means of an insulated barrier, the improvement consisting in that the contacts are electrically connected in series such that the arcs formed between the contact pairs are magnetically motivated by the sum of the current paths through both contact pairs.
