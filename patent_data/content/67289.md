# Mechanism for driving operator interchangeable gear driven platens in typewriters or printers.

## Abstract
A support 32 for an idler gear 26, 30 is pivotally mounted about the driving gear axis 36 in a gear driven platen drive for a typewriter or printer. A constraining member 16, 18 mounted with the interchangeable platen 10 engages and constrains support 32 in a position to insure engagement of idler gear 26, 30 with platen gear 14 and may be sized or shaped to insure proper positioning of support 32 and idler 26, 30 for a number of different platen gears of varying diameters, allowing platens and platen gears to be readily changed to vary the line feed increment as desired by the operator.
