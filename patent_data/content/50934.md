# Fluorine containing hydrogel forming polymeric materials.

## Abstract
Polymeric materials suitable for bio medical applica tions, particularly in making contact lenses, are derived by reaction of the following 1 20 to 40 mole of a polymerisable amide which is an unsubstituted or substituted amide of a carboxylic acid containing olefinic unsaturation, 2 25 to 55 mole of a N vinyl lactam, 3 5 to 20 mole of a polymerisable ester which is an ester of a carboxylic acid containing olefinic unsaturation, 4 1 to 10 mole of a polymerisable carboxylic acid containing olefinic unsaturation, and 5 3 to 10 mole of a hydrophobic monomer component comprising a a fluorine containing polymerisable monomer having a fluoroaliphatic side chain, or a polymerisable monomer having an esterifiable group, and b a non fluorine containing polymerisable hydrophobic vinyl monomer and subsequently esterifying any esterifiable groups pro vided by monomer 5a using a fluorine containing aliphatic acid or derivative thereof, the amounts of the monomers 1 to 5 totalling 100 mole , and either the copolymerisation is carried out in the presence of a cross linking agent or the resulting copolymer is subsequently cross linked. The polymeric material of the present invention may be machined to form contact lenses and subsequently hydrated to form a hydrogel which is suitable for use as an extended wear contact lens.
