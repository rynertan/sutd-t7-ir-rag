# Wide fabric manufacturing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Wide woven fabric 10 having dipped and treated cords 19, 20, 23, 24 is made by first connecting warp cords 19, 20 of relatively strong material in at least two narrow sheets 11, 12 . The narrow sheets 11, 12 are dipped and treated after which they are positioned in loom letoff rolls 17, 18 adjacent a loom 26 where they are joined to form a wide fabric 10 having a width greater than the width of eigher of the narrow sheets 11, 12 . The warp cords 19, 20 from the narrow sheets 11, 12 are guided from the letoff rolls 17, 18 into the loom 26 and during the process the narrow sheets 11, 12 may be run through a cord separating apparatus 29 to separate the warp cords 19,20 . The warp cords 19, 20 may be woven in the loom 26 with a dipped and treated weft cord 31 to provide a wide reinforcing sheet 10 with a heavy woven construction having a width greater than the width of any one of the narrow sheets 11, 12 .
