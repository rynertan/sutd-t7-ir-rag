# Process for forming direct positive images, direct positive silver halide elements, compositions and compounds as characteristic feature of such processes and elements.

## Abstract
Direct positive photographic elements are disclosed em ploying internal latent image silver halide emulsions associated with developer autoxidation promoter agents constituted by 5 or 6 membered nucleus containing heterocyclic compounds comprising an azomethine group, whose methine group is substituted with a 5 amino 1,2,4 triazolyl group, and or copper complex compounds thereof. Preferably said direct positive photographic elements are multilayer elements comprising internal latent image type type silver halide emulsion layers sensitized to different regions of the visible light and associated with image dye providing com pounds photographic color couplers .
