# ACTIVE ARC SUPPRESSION CIRCUIT FOR DIRECT CURRENT SWITCHES

## Abstract
A DC arc suppression circuit is disclosed for suppressing arcs which occur across a mechanical switch or circuit breaker. Several embodiments are described which employ a bipolar transistor Q1 to actively shunt the load current around the mechanical switch S1 when the contacts 2, 4 are opened for a period of time long enough to enable the contacts to be separated by a sufficient distance to prevent arc development. When contact bounce occurs upon closure of the contacts, arcing is prevented by a diode D1 connected in parallel with the base emitter portion of the transistor Q1 which restores the arc suppressing capacity of the circuit almost immediately upon the first closure of the contacts 2, 4 .
