## Description
CHAIN EXrEED xnEUXtEs OF MEIHCrrlMATE AND AMINOPTERIN The invention relates to certain novel chemical compounds having anti tumour activity against L1210 leukemias in mice together with low toxicity and to therapeutic compositions containing these compounds or certain related compounds, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carrier, which are useful for administration to mice and other mammals having certain tumors for extending their life spans. Methotrexate MTX 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroylglutamic acid and Aminopterin AMT 4 amino4 deoxy pteroylglutamic acid are folate antagonists and act bs antinebplastic agents by interfering with one or more biosynthetic steps involving folate coenzymes of the tumor cell. The structure of MTX differs from AMT in that the former contains a methyl group in the N10 position while the latter does not, having hydrogen instead. The structural formula of MTX is as follows EMI1.1 MTX and AMT have been found to be effective clinically against certain malignant tumors for example, good to excellent tumor response has been seen in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, Burkitt s lymphoma, carcinoma of the breast, mycosis fungoides, epidermoid cancer of the head and neck area, and osteogenic sarcoma.In addition, MTX is the drug of choice in the treatment of choriocarcinoma and is also used for certain non neoplastic conditions such as generalized psoriasis and certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.However, chemotherapy with MTX or AMT is accomplished by a variety of toxicities, particularly their ability to form polyglutamates, which limit the effectiveness of the compounds and their long term use. The novel compounds of the present invention comprise MTX and AMT analogues in which the dicarboxylic acid portion of the molecule contains from 6 25, and preferably from 6 15, carbon atoms. These compounds have the following generic structure EMI2.1 in which R CH3 or H n 3 22, preferably 3 12.They are compounds in which the glutamic acid moiety ofMTX or AMT is replaced by an L a amino dicarboxylic acid having 6 25 carbon atoms. Among such L a amino dicarboxylic acids are L craminoadipic, L a aminopimelic, L o aminosuberiC, L a aminoazelaic, L a aminosebacic, Li a aminoundecanedioic, L a amino dodecanedioic, and L a aminotetradecanedioic. The novel compounds of the present invention are prepared by the condensation of N10 protected4 amino 4 deoxy pteroic acid or N10 protected 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroic acid with a diester of an L a amino dicarboxylic acid containing 6 25 carbon atoms, followed by hydrolysis with base. Coupling is accomplished in up to 85 yield by the use of the peptide bond forming reagent diethyl phosphorocyanidate at room temperature. For example, the compounds of examples 1 3 are synthesized by the condensation of 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroic acid with the diesters of L a aminoadipic,L a aminopimelic, and L a aminosuberic acids. Therapeutic compositions containing the novel compounds of the present invention as the active agents can be prepared by dispersing or dissolving the active agent in any pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carrier suitable for the desired mode of administration, which may be parenteral, that is, by injection or infusion which is intravenous, intracavitary, or other conventional mode. Preferably the carrier is an aqueous medium buffered to pH 7.2 7.5, the physiological range.Any suitable conventional buffer can be used such as phosphate, bicarbonate, or citrate. If desired, saline solution can be used, with pH adjustment and buffering.Dosages may vary over a wide range depending upon individual conditions and can readily be determined using the dosages commonly employed for MTX or AMT as exemplars. The toxicity and therapeutic effectiveness of the compounds of the present invention are shown by in vitro assays and by in vivo evaluations in mice. The cytotoxicity of the compounds against L1210 cells in culture is measured according to the method described byRosowsky et al. 1982 J. Med. Chem., 25, 171. The results show that cytotoxicity to L1210 cells in culture is comparable to, or slightly higher than that of MTX orAMT, indicating that the ability of the compounds of the present invention to cross the cell membrane is preserved. Furthermore, cytotoxicity increases as the number of CH2 groups in the amino acid side chain is extended. The ability of the compounds of the present invention to act as substrates or inhibitors for the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase, folate polyglutamate synthetase, and carboxypeptidase G1 is also measured in in vitro assays. Dihydrofolate reductase assays are performed as described by Rosowsky et al. 1981 J. Med. Chem. 24, 1450. The results of the dihydrofolate reductase assays show that the compounds of the present invention bind to bacterial Lactobacillus casei and mammalian L1210 mouse leukemia dihydrofolate reductase with an affinity comparable to MTX and AMT and that increasing the distance between the side chain groups is not detrimental to binding. Folate polyglutamate synthetase assays are performed as described by Forsch et al. 1983 AACRProc. 24. The results of the folate polyglutamate synthetase assays show that, unlike MTX and AMT, the compounds of the present invention are poor substrates for the enzyme and therefore are not expected to form polyglutamates intracellularly. This property, which presumably accounts for the higher dosage and frequency requirements of these compounds relative to MTX or AMT, is of particular interest and is a therapeutic asset. In patients with MTX or AMT resistant tumors, where resistance is associated with a lower capacity for polyglutamation than for normal proliferative tissues, dose escalation will be tolerated better with. the compounds of the present invention than with MTX or AMT, since the compounds of this invention are not polyglutamated and thus have a faster clearance rate and lower toxicity than MTX or AMT. Thus, the compounds of the present invention whose cytotoxic action does not involve polyglutamation will offer an advantage, since a tumor with a low capacity for polyglutamate formation would be no less sensitive than normal proliferative tissues.Additionally, it should be noted that the compounds of.the present invention may find use in longterm low dose regimens, e.g., in psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis treatment, where progressive MTX orAMT polyglutamate accumulation in hepatocytes may be responsible for the chronic hepatotoxicity typically associated with this type of therapy. Carboxypeptidase Gi assays are performed as described by McCullough et al. 1971 J. Biol. Chem.246, 7207. The results of the carboxypeptidase G1 assays show that while MTX is rapidly cleaved by the enzyme, as described by Chabner et al. 1972 Nature, 239, 395, the compounds of the present invention are not. This property is of particular interest and is a therapeutic advantage since carboxypeptidase Gl can be used to create a deficiency in reduced folates and thus potentiate the therapeutic effect of the compounds of the present invention without inactivating them. In vivo antitumor activity is determined against L1210 ascitic leukemia in mice according to a standard NCI protocol, Geran et al. 1972 CancerChemother. Rep., 3 3 , 1. The results of the in vivo anti tumour assays against L1210 leukemia in mice show that the compounds of the present invention increase survival to about the same extent as MTX or AMT. The following examples are intended to illustrate more fully the preparation of the compounds of the present invention without acting as a limitation upon the scope of the invention. Example 1 N 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroyl L alpha aminoadipic acid.
