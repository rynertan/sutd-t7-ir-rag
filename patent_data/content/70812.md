# Device for the centrifugal chill casting of light alloy parts, such as motor vehicle wheels.

## Abstract
The chill mould is mounted on a support 22 which is rotatable about the vertical axis of its casting cavity and is composed of a lower element 62 , an upper element 72 which has a pouring opening, and four peripheral elements 92a, 92b, 94a, 94b arranged in two opposing pairs. The lower element 62 occupies a casting position on the support 22 and coaxial therewith, the upper element 72 is movable between a casting position in which it overlies the lower element 62 coaxially, and shakeout position in which it does not interfere with the upward removal of the piece from the mould, and the peripheral elements 92a, 92b, 94a, 94b are displaceable radially on the support 22 to allow their movement from a casting position, in which together they surround the upper and lower elements 62, 72 , to a shakeout position in which they are further removed from the axis of rotation. The elements of the chill mould are provided with locking means which are mutually engageable due to the move ment of a first pair 92a92b of the opposed peripheral elements towards their respective casting positions when the lower and upper elements 62, 72 and the opposed peripheral elements 94a, 94b of the other pair are substantially in their respective casting positions. Means are also provided for locking the peripheral elements 92a, 92b of the first pair in their respective casting positions.
