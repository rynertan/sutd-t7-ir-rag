# SELF OPENING ENVELOPE

## Abstract
An envelope is provided with a string assembly 22 disposed along the line of fold 18 of the sealable flap. The string assembly is pressed into position with a coating of a pressure adhesive, which is co extensive with the line of fold. One envelope corner is weakened, so that pulling outwardly from this corner will tear the envelope and will open it along the string assembly, which acts as a knife edge.
