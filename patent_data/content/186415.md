# Electrophotographic imaging member.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic imaging member is disclosed comprising a charge generation layer, a contiguous charge transport layer comprising an aromatic amine or hydrazone charge transport molecule in a continuous polymeric binder phase, and a cellulosic hole trapping material located on the same side of the charge transport layer as the charge generation layer, the cellulosic hole trapping material being free of electron withdrawing groups and having the structu ral formula
