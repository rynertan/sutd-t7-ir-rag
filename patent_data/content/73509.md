# Semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A stacked semiconductor IC device is disclosed which comprises a single crystalline semiconductor substrate 10 having planar surfaces 12, 14 with different height and a slant surface 16 , a single crystalline semiconductive layer 40 which is epitaxially grown from the substrate 10 on or above the substrate 10 , and which has planar surfaces 42, 44 with different height and a slant surface 46 and a substantially uni form thickness, groups of semiconductor elements 20, 22, 50, 52 each formed on the low planar surface 14 of the sub strate 10 and on the low planar surface 42 of the layer 40 , and contact wiring pattern 58 passing through the slant por tion of the layer 40 to electrically connect the element groups.
