## Description
PREPARING METALLIC ZIRCONIUM, HAFNIUM OR TITANIUM The present invention relates to the preparation of metallic zirconium, metallic hafnium and metallic titanium. So far, metallic zirconium Zr and metallic hafnium Hf have been produced by reducing their chlorides with metallic.magncsium or sodium in a stream of an inert gas. Since metallic sodium is hazardous, metallic magnesium has been used more often as the reducing agent. Metallic titanium has generally been produced from TiO2, by chlorinating it in the presence of carbon to produce TiC14 as an intermediate, and reducing this intermediate by contact with metallic magnesium or sodium to obtain metallic titanium. These conventional processes, however, involve rather rather complicated operations for producing metallic zirconium or metallic hafnium and a high cost in consumption of metallic magnesium or sodium. In the preparation of metallic titanium, sources of raw materialTiO2 are limited since the material is required to have a low content of impurities, and a complex process for purifying the TiC14 intermediate is needed before metallic titanium is produced. In addition, the preparation of titanium is accompanied by troublesome management in order to attain the desired end. The high cost involved when metallic magnesium or sodium is used for the reduction necessarily raises the production cost of metallic titanium. This is the chief reason why application of titanium is not widely developed despite the excellent properties.of the metal. The present invention provides anew, improved, process which is intended to overcome such drawbacks of the previous processes. The invention provides a process for preparing metallic zirconium, hafnium or titanium, which process comprises bringing a fluorine containing compound of zirconium, hafnium or titanium into contact with heated metallic aluminium or magnesium, to convert the fluorine conaining compound into the corresponding metal. In this invention, metallic Zr, Hf and Ti are prepared from fluorine containing compounds of the metals, instead of from their chlorides. The fluorine containing compounds are better starting materials. Crystals of them are prepared more easily. The fluorine containing compounds provide more easily purifiable crystals than do the corresponding chlorides. In addition, metallic aluminium can be used as the reducing agent in the present invention. Furthermore, the fluorine necessary for preparing the fluorine containing compounds as intermediates can be recirculated in the process. In the present process, a fluorine containing compound of zirconium, hafnium or titanium reacts with heated metallic aluminium or magnesium to convert the fluorine containing compound into the corresponding metal. The reaction should naturally not be conducted in the presence of material which mars the reaction. Oxygen, for example air, mars the reaction and hence should be avoided.

The invention is illustrated by the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a flow sheet illustrating the basic process of the invention Fig. 2 is a more elaborate flow sheet which also illustrates the production of the starting material and Fig. 3 is a yet more elaborate flow sheet which also illustrates the recovery and re use of fluoride after the basic process. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, but it will be appreciated that discussion is applicable generally. The flow sheet of Fig. 1 shows the basic process for producing Zr, Hf or Ti. The fluorine containing compound A of Zr, Hf or Ti is introduced into a reactor C where metallic aluminium or magnesium is heated, preferably above 14000C for zirconium and hafnium, and preferably above 2200 C for titanium, in a stream of an inert or reducing gas or in vacuum. In the reactor, metallic zirconium, metallic hafnium or metallic titanium is prepared according to reactions such as are expressed by the following equations EMI10.1 The fluorine containing compounds of Zr and Hf are not limited to those shown in equations 1 to 4 . As shown in the equations above, Alp3, MgF2, HF and NH4F D are produced as by products in addition to the metallic zirconium or metallic hafnium. The former compounds can be led outside the system in a gaseous form, depending on the operating conditions of the reactor C . If they are retained in the reactor, they can be removed by washing with water or dilute aqueous acids or by heating in a vacuum furnace. Metallic titanium can be prepared by the reaction with metallic aluminium according to the following equations EMI10.2 By products such as A1F3, KF and NH14F D are led outside the reactor C in gaseous form to separate them from Ti. Alternatively, depending on the operating conditions, the metallic titanium is washed with water or dilute aqueous acid to remove the by products. Metallic titanium E can be obtained from fluorine containing compounds of titanium A by the reaction with metallic magnesium B , usually heated at a temperature above 2200C, as shown in the following equations EMI11.1 The flow sheet of Fig. 2 illustrates the process in which the fluorine containing compound of Zr, Hf orTi is produced as starting material. An organic solvent F extracting and containing Zr, Hf or Ti is led to a stripping stage G , where Zr, Hf or Ti in the organic phase is transferred to an aqueous phase H by being contacted with an aqueous solution E which contains one or more of NH4 and F for Zr and Hf and of NH4 , F andK for Ti, to obtain fluorine containing compounds of these metals.This may be illustrated by the following equations EMI11.2 EMI12.1 where R.H ia an extracting agent having an H type exchanging group, and TBP represents tributyl phosphate. Regenerated organic solvent K is circulated again to the extraction stage. The Zr, Hf or Ti transferred to the aqueous medium is deposited as crystals such as NH4 2ZrF61 NH4 2HfF6 TiF4, NH14 2TiF6 or K2TiF6, and is removed from the aqueous medium by filtration J . The fluorine containing compound of Zr, Hf or Ti obtained A is treated as shown in Fig. 1 to produce metallic zirconium, hafnium or titanium. Fig. 3 is a flow sheet of the present invention which includes a procedure for treating A1F3, MgF2 and NH4F D by products from the reduction of the fluorine compounds of Zr, Hf and Ti by means of metallic magnesium and aluminium.The route from the organic solvent F which contains Zr, Hf or Ti as a result of extraction to the reactor C is as shown inFig. 2. AlF3 or MgF2 D from the reactor C is transferred to the decomposition stage CM , where it is converted into A1203 or MgO N by the action of steam or air, as illustrated by the following equations EMI13.1 The HF Q produced in the oxidation reactions is introduced for recovery into the absorption stage P where a NH4F and NH14H F2 containing solution circulates, the solution acting as stripper for Zr, Hf or Ti. As the reactor C of the present invention, those of various forms can be used including conventional closed type electric furnaces or external heating furnaces having a double structure upright, horizontal or rotational . The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples.

Meanwhile, aluminium was vaporized by heating in a stream of argon. The two vapours were brought into contact in a separate reactor. When the latter reactor was cooled, analysis of a black reaction product deposited on the inside wall and at the bottom of the reactor revealed that it was 4.8 g of metallic titanium.Example 6 A mixed organic solvent consisting of 60iso of TBP and 140 of isoparaffin commercially available under the name Isoparaffin which extracted and contained H2TiF6 was brought Into contact with an aqueous solution containing 200 g l of KHF2 to produce crystals or K2Ti6. 20 Grams of the crystals were peeked together with 50 g or metallic aluminium at the bottom of a reactor.The reactor was filled up with 82 gas and the temperature was rapidly raised to 1000 C and maintained there for 2 hours. Then the reactor was cooled. All the residue found on the inside wall and at the bottom or the reactor was collected, washed with 5 HCl, and analysed as 4 g of metallic titanium.Example 7 Gaseous TiF4, which was produced by heating 20 g of crystalline TiF4 at a sufficient temperature in a stream or hydrogen, was transferred to a reactor in which metallic magnesium was preheated at 8000 C.
