# Terminal independent color memory for a digital image display system.

## Abstract
The present terminal independent color memory for a digital image display system provides for inter system com patability, color display systems generally having varying modes of access to color memories, varying color memory capacities, and features such as blinking implemented in varying ways. The data processor 1 of the present system may access color memory 6a of video controller 6 or color values stored in permanent memory 9 or random access memory 10 , responsive to the same command language. The present data processor 1 is also capable of entering color data values comprising color hue and grey levels into color memory for use in a terminal independent manner. Multiple process chained blinking from a particular color to a particular color is also provided by the present processor, the several processes in timedelayed relation ship to one another.
