# Raster display generating system.

## Abstract
A visual display system for use in converting calligraphic symbology information into raster scanned symbology. The system simultaneously generates and displays calligraphic and raster matrix imagery utilizing the same set of software instruc tions. The imagery is displayed upon a single, hybrid calligra phic raster matrix display 10 or separate raster matrix and calligraphic displays. A programmable calligraphic symbology generator 20 utilizes digital stroking techniques that success sively generates addressing for a matrix arrayed memory and determines the attributes of both the raster matrix generated and calligraphic generated symbology. The information is stored in a single or a plurality of matrix arrayed memories ac cording to desired symbol attributes and system performance, and is passed via a raster image buffer 30 to the matrix dis play 10 .
