# Polyimide esters and filaments.

## Abstract
High modulus filaments are melt spun from polyimide esters derived from I 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, a diphenol and 4 carboxy N p carboxyphenyl phthalimide II 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, an aromatic dicarboxylic acid 4 hydroxy N p hydroxyphenyl phthalimide or III 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 carboxy N p hydroxyphenyl phthalimide. The polyimide es ters are optically anisotropic in the melt. As spun filaments from these polymers can be heat treated while free from tension to increase their tenacity.
