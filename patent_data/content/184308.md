# Process for preparing milbemycin derivatives and certain novel compounds employed therein.

## Abstract
13 Hydroxy 5 ketomilbemycin derivatives are prepared by oxidizing a 5 ketomilbemycin with selenium dioxide in the presence of a lower aliphatic carboxylic acid. A range of new 13 acyloxy 5 ketomilbemycins and a method of preparing them are also disclosed.
