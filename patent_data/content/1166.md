# Liquid polymer compositions, process for the preparation of adhesives and laminate structures.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a composition characterised in that it comprises at least one alkyl acrylate liquid polymer containing polymerized therein at least about 65 weight percent of at least one alkyl acrylate, about 1 weight percent to about 20 weight percent of N binyl 2 pyrrolidone, and containing both terminal and random hydroxyl functionality, wherein the alkyl group of the alkyl acrylate contains from 3 to 10 carbon atoms. It also provides a composition in which there is additionally present at least prepolymer of a polyalkylene ether glycol or polyester glycol with an excess amount of an aromatic diisocyanate, such compositions being capable of use as adhesives, particularly in the production of laminate structures.
