# Air and liquid supplying device for endoscope.

## Abstract
An air and liquid supplying device for an endoscope has a main body 28 with a connecting portion 30 and an air pump 43 arranged in the main body. A first switch control valve 9 is connected to an air supply channel 7 and a liquid supply channel 8 of the endoscope. A universal cord 4 is con nected at one end to a control section 2 of the endoscope and at the other end to the connecting portion through a connector 6 . A first air feed path 96a extends from the first valve to the end of the connector through the universal cord. A liquid feed path extends from the first valve through the universal cord and communicates with a first liquid supply tank. The air pump is connected to the connecting portion through a sec ond air feed path 96b . A second liquid supply tank 45 including second liquid is connected to the second air feed path. A second switch control valve 48 is connected to the second air feed path to switch between the supply of air and the supply of the second liquid to the second air feed path. When the connector is not connected to the connecting por tion, leakage of the second liquid through the connecting portion is prevented by a leakage preventing device 99 .
