## Description
Tetracyclines are well known broad spectrum antibiotics. Recently antibiotic tetracyclines have also been discovered to inhibit the activity of collagen destructive enzymes, e.g. mammalian collagenase, macrophage elastase and bacterial collagenases. For example, tetracyclines have recently been found to be useful in the treatment of periodontal diseases, severe progressive adult periodontitis and localized juvenile periodontitis. Antibiotic tetracyclines are also useful in the treatment of non infected corneal ulcers, in the treatment of pathologically excessive bone resorption, in the treatment of joint destruction involved with rheumatoid arthritis and generally in the treatment of those diseases characterized by excessive collagen destruction. Also, in Moreover, clinically, the antibiotic tetracyclines Minocin, Achromycin and Vibramycin at regular and low dose levels were found to reduce collagenase activity in human periodontal pockets and regular dose levels of tetracycline brought about the healing of refractory non infected corneal ulcers in humans, lesions which are believed to be mediated by mammalian collagenase. In a report by Golub et al. the use of the antibiotic tetracyclines minocycline, doxycycline and tetracycline as effective inhibitors of collagenases from different mammalian sources, including humans, has been demonstrated However, although the commercially available antibiotic tetracyclines are effective as anti collagenolytic agents, long term use, either continuously or episodically, e.g. two weeks on three months off two weeks on three months off, is subject to the usual complications of long term antibiotic usage, such as intestinal disturbance, overgrowth of yeast and fungi, the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, etc. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide compositions and therapies based on tetracyclines having substantially no effective antibiotic and antibacterial activity, and particularly the utilization of tetracyclines which have anti collagenolytic activity in the treatment of diseases or conditions characterized by excessive collagen destruction, without at the same time giving rise to the usual complications involved with long term antibiotic use. It is another object of this invention to provide compositions containing said non antibiotic tetracyclines and the use of such commpositions as anti collagenase agents while at the same time providing novel compositions and applications of such compositions in the treatment of various diseases and conditions characterized by excessive collagen destruction. It is a special object or aspect of this invention to provide non antibiotic tetracycline compositions having improved properties, such as animal feed compositions containing tetracyclines which are effective when supplied or administered to animals not only as anti collagenolytic agents but which also provide improved animal nutrition. Current usage of the antibiotic tetracycline as an additive to animal feed for promoting improved feed conversion and weight gain has been found to have the adverse effect of producing the overgrowth of resistant organisms which are presently considered to be hazardous to human health. By the practice of this invention this adverse effect is eliminated while at the same time animal weight gain is promoted. How these and other objects of this invention are achieved will become apparent in the light of the accompanying disclosure and drawings whyerein It has been discovered that tetracyclines which have substantially no effective antibiotic or antibacterial activity possess anti collagen destructive enzyme activity or anti collagenase activity. More particularly, it has been discovered that tetracyclines which have substantially no effective antibiotic or antibacterial activity possess the ability to inhibit collagenolytic enzyme activity and collagen resorption. Tetracyclines are characterized by four carbocyclic rings and are well known antimicrobials or antibiotics. Not all tetracyclines, however, possess antimicrobial or antibiotic properties. A number of tetracyclines exhibit substantially no antimicrobial or antibacterial activity whereas other tetracyclines, although exhibiting some antimicrobial or antibiotic activity, do not possess such antimicrobial or antibacterial activity to the extent that they are useful as chemotherapeutic agents or as antibiotics in the treatment of diseases. Those tetracyclines which exhibit no or substantially no or insufficient antimicrobial or antibiotic activity are usefully employed in the practices of this invention. Especially useful in the practices of this invention is the tetracycline, dedimethylaminotetracycline. As indicated, however, other tetracyclines which do not possess sufficient, if any, antimicrobial activity are also useful in the practices of this invention. Generally, tetracyclines, as has now been discovered, whether possessing antimicrobial or antibiotic activity or not, all possess anti collagen destructive enzyme activity or anti collagenase activity. This anti collagenase activity appears to be attributable to the unique structure of tetracyclines, i.e. the special four carbocyclic ring structure which is characteristic of and possessed by the tetracyclines. As an observation, it is believed that the carbonyl moieties in the carbocyclic ring nucleus of the tetracycline are important to the anti collagenolytic activity of these compounds because they chelate the metal ions calcium and zinc. This is an important property since the collagenolytic enzymes mentioned are metal dependent. The action of the tetracyclines, when employed in accordance with the practices of this invention as anti collagenolytic agents, appears to be systemic, although the tetracyclines may be employed topically, such as direct application to the gingival tissue, such as in the case of the treatment of periodontitis wherein excessive collagenase activity is involved and skin as in the treatment of ulcerative lesions, such as decubitus ulcers, diabetic ulcers, epidermolysis bullosa. In the practices of this invention the tetracyclines may be employed in any of the known modes of application appropriate for the treatment of the condition involved. The dosage of the non antimicrobial or non antibiotic tetracyclines of this invention to reduce collagenase activity or when employed as an anti collagenolytic agent could be the same as or slightly greater than the dosage of conventional tetracyclines when used as antimicrobial or antibiotic agents. In addition, however, the dosage can be substantially below or but a fraction or minor amount of such standard dosages or levels at which conventional antimicrobial tetracyclines are employed, such as about 5 50 of the standard therapeutic dosages with respect to the utilization of antimicrobial or antibiotic tetracyclines when employed in the treatment of diseases. One commercially important aspect of the practices of this invention involves the utilization of the special non antimicrobial or non antibiotic tetracyclines, such as dedimethylaminotetracycline as an additive to animal feeds. Animal feed for ruminant, non ruminant and ruminant related animals usually comprises a mixture of grains, proteins, amino acids, minerals, vitamins and additives, such as preservatives, antioxidants, bacteriostats, fungistats and supplements that help protect the animal against parasites and diseases. The advantage of the use of the special tetracyclines in accordance with this invention as a component or additive in animal feed is that such a use would likely not give rise to antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The primary purpose of incorporating the special type tetracyclines of this invention in animal feed is as an anti collagenolytic agent to improve animal nutrition and body weight. By way of example as to the concentration or amount of the special tetracyclines of this invention incorporated in animal feeds, for poultry feeds for chickens, turkeys and broilers, the amount of the tetracycline incorporated in the feed would be in the range from 10 grams to 200 grams per ton of feed. With respect to feed for beef cattle for young calfs up to about 12 weeks of age, the amount of the tetracycline in the feed should be such that 0.1 mg to 1.0 mg per pound of calf weight per day is taken up by the calf upon consumption of the feed. With respect to beef cattle, the amount of tetracycline present in the feed should be such that the animal takes up or consumes from 75 mg to 300 mg per pound per day from the tetracycline containing feed. Stock solutions of minocycline, dedimethylaminotetracycline CMT and tetracycline were prepared as aqueous solutions. These solutions were to be used to determine the antibacterial activity of each of these tetracyclines. The minocycline was obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri, Lot 60F 0048. The tetracycline was also obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri Lot 103F0350 and the dedimethylaminotetracycline was synthetically prepared in accordance withm the method of J. H. Boothe et al, In this study four different groups of rats were utilized. Group I was an untreated control group of conventional rats harboring a normal oral flora Group II was an untreated control group of diabetic rats rendered diabetic by administration of streptozocin Group III was a diabetic group treated orally with metronidazol and Group IV was a diabetic group of animals treated orally with dedimethylaminotetracycline. At the conclusion of the experiment the rats were sacrificed and samples were removed with sterile currettes from the gingival margin of the molar teeth of rats from each of these groups of animals and transferred to broth and incubated for 72 hours at 37 C. The organisms isolated were compared to determine if there was any major change in the composition of the flora following the administration of either metronidazol or dedimethylaminotetracycline. The results of the isolation and identification of the organisms obtained from gingival samples indicated that 1 the untreated conventional control animals had slightly more organisms present than the animals in any of the other groups and were easily identified by the amount of growth and by the bacterial compositions, 2 the diabetic animals receiving metronidazol produced less growth from the gingival samples than any other group and had predominantly Gram positive cocci 3 the untreated diabetic control animals and the diabetic animals receiving dedimethylaminotetracycline were essentially indistinguishable in the amount of growth obtained from the gingival samples and in the bacterial composition of each sample. These results are summarized in Table 2. These Golub et al, Another experiment was carried out. In this experiment, a single level of bacterial collagenase was incubated a with a wide range of concentrations of CMT. 0, 2, 10, 20 and 60 µg ml and b with the known inhibitors of metallo proteases, EDTA and phenanthroline. As in the first experiment, 10 ng of collagenase degraded about half of the available radiolabeled collagen substrate after an 18 hr. incubation at 27 C in the absence of CMT, Fig. 2. The very low concentration of 2 µg ml CMT inhibited collagenase activity by about 20 while the concentrations of 10 60 µg ml CMT reduced activity about 90 . These higher concentrations of CMT inhibited collagenase activity by the same extent as the chelating agents, EDTA and phenanthroline, consistent with the hypothesis that the metal binding characteristics of the tetracyclines including CMT are responsible, at least in part, for their anti collagenolytic enzyme properties. A third experiment was carried out and the results are presented in Fig. 3. In this experiment radiolabeled collagen molecules were incubated 18 hrs., 27 C with an extract of rat leukocytes known to contain collagenolytic enzyme activity. This mammalian collagenase preparation was incubated with 0 60 µg ml CMT or with the collagenase inhibitors, EDTA or phenanthroline. The collagenase by itself degraded about 55 of the available collagen substrate. In this experiment, 2 10 µg ml CMT reduced the collagenase activity by about 20 while 20 and 60 µg ml reduced the activity about 85 . EDTA and phenanthroline, two metal chelating agents, completely inhibited the activity of this mammalian collagenase, as expected, since leukocyte collagenase is known to depend on the presence of the metal ions, calcium and zinc, for normal activity. It is believed that the reason why this mammalian collagenase preparation required a higher concentration of CMT, than the bacterial collagenase preparation, to achieve the same degree of inhibition was two fold Firstly, the mammalian collagenase was a relatively impure enzyme compared to the highly purified bacterial enzyme. Thus, the CMT could have reacted with other metallo proteases e.g. gelatinase in the leukocyte preparation, in addition to reacting with collagenase, thus effectively reducing the inhibitor CMT collagenase ratio. Secondly, leukocytes contain a high level of calcium ions and earlier experiments demonstrated that adding calcium to a collagenase tetracycline mixture could overcome the inhibition of the enzyme activity. Just prior to killing the rats, a subgingival plaque sample was taken from each animal from the maxillary areas. The samples were immediately placed into prereduced broth to protect the anaerobic microorganisms incubated under anaerobic conditions, and the relative numbers of the Gram positive, Gram negative and motile microorganisms were assessed. As shown in Fig. 4, the control rats, over the 37 day protocol, gained weight while the untreated diabetics D group progressively lost weight. Daily metronidazole therapy had no effect in retarding the weight loss in the D rats, whereas daily treatment of the D rats with CMT completely inhibited body weight loss. In addition, towards the end of the experiment after day 30 the D rats treated with CMT began to gain weight in a manner paralleling the non diabetic controls while the untreated D rats during the same time period continued to lose weight. The data in Fig. 5 shows a similar pattern of change. The D and D metronid groups lost more than 50 of the skin mass by the end of the 37 day protocol, whereas treating the D rats with CMT on a daily basis inhibited the loss of skin mass skin loss is a complication of the diabetic condition . The data in Table 3 shows that all of the diabetic groups D group D metronid groups D CMT group were severely hyperglycemic 638 850 mg blood glucose levels compared to the normoglycemic 104 mg control rats. Treating the diabetic rats with metronidazole had absolutely no effect on the pathologically excessive collagenase activity in the diabetics skins, Table 3, or in the diabetics gingiva, Fig. 6, even though the blood glucose in the metronidazole antimicrobial treated rats was slightly reduced Table 3 . In marked contrast, even though the CMT treatment appeared to have a lesser effect than metronidazole on blood glucose concentration, this modified tetracycline dramatically inhibited skin and gingival collagenase activity by about 50 , Table 3 and Fig. 6. These data demonstrate that CMT inhibits mammalian collagenase activity and collagen resorption Although emphasis in this disclosure and the practices of this invention has been placed on the dedimethylaminotetracycline as the non antimicrobial or non antibacterial tetracycline, other substantially non antimicrobial or non antibacterial tetracyclines are also useful, such as 6γ benzylthiomethylene tetracycline having the structural formula Also useful is the nitrile analog of tetracycline having the structural formula Also useful is the Mono N alkylated amide of tetracylcine having the structural formula Also useful is the 6 Fluoro demethyltetracycline having the structural formula and also 11α chlorotetracycline having the structural formula The special non antimicrobial or non antibacterial tetracyclines of this invention are suitably employed per se or in the form of their salts, such as the hydrochloride salts. Other water soluble salts, such as the sodium or potassium salts, might also be employed. The tetracyclines of this invention might also be encapsulated for oral administration since, as indicated hereinabove, the tetracyclines of this invention appear to be systemically effective as anti collagenolytic agents. The tetracyclines of this invention can also be formulated in the form of tablets, capsules, elixirs and the like. The tetracyclines of this invention may be formulated into solutions or suspensions for intramuscular or peritoneal administration. Additionally, the tetracyclines might also be incorporated or formulated into a polymer carrier or delivery system for topical or local use, such as in the case of the treatment of periodontal diseases, such as for delivery directly into the periodontal pocket. Suitable polymeric materials useful for incorporating therein the tetracyclines of this invention include ethylene vinyl acetate, polycaprolactone, polyurethane, ethylene cellulose which, after having the tetracyclines incorporated or dispersed therein, are suitable shaped or formed into fibers, sheets, film or particles or granular material capable of being shaped or formed into a suitable form for treatment of periodontal diseases and the like or for direct application to a lesion evidencing pathological collagen destruction or resorption. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosures many modifications, alterations and substitutions are possible in the practice of this invention.
