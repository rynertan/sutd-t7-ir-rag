# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO RODS AND PIPES

## Abstract
Improvements in or relating to rods and pipes with particu lar but non limiting application to the oil pumping industry. One aspect includes insulated tubing and couplings thereof wherein the thermal insulation is improvided. An advantagous arrange ment uses a vacuum to improve the insulation. There is particularly described coupling means for cou pling first and second lengths of insulating tubing which in clude respective inner 13 and outer 1 spaced tubes defining an inter tube space 16 therebetween characterised by the coupling means comprising respective first and second cou pling portions 26, 27 which are coupleable to form an inner tube seal 6 and an outer tube seal 6 which seals 6 are spaced from one another. Also descirbed is thermally insulated fluid transfer tubing comprising first 1 and second 13 tubes arranged one within the other characterised by the space 16 between them being evaucated. Further disclosed are improvements in heavy wall pipe wherein thin wall pipe is welded to thick wall pipe 40 . In parti cular, a method of making a heavy walled pipe characterised by the steps of providing a shaped section of pipe 40 having comparatively thick walls, providing two lengths of pipe having comparatively thin walls, and welding the lengths of pipe to re spective ends of said shaped section 40 . Additionally there are disclosed improvements in paraffin scrapers particularly in providing a full circumference scraping action under axial movement alone. There is described a paraf fin scraper 51 for scraping the inner surface of a pipe compris ing a substantially cylindrical body having an oil passage 54 for axial passage of oil characterised by radially outwardly dis posed blade means 53 arranged so that the inner surface of the pipe may be scraped around its full circumference by axial movement of the scraper 51 .
