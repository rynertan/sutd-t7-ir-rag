# Planetory gear box with eccentrics.

## Abstract
A planetary gearing with eccentrics comprising at least two gears 37,45 with circular movement meshing with the same internally toothed output ring gear 8 , each gear 37, 45 getting its circular movement from at least two eccentrics 18, 21 having their axes of rotation parallel and equally spaced from the output shaft axis, the eccentrics 18, 21 of one gear 37 being angularly displaced from the eccentrics 40, 22 of the other gear 45 , the wall of the housing 1 taking the reaction force from the eccentrics 17, 20 , support shafts 11, 12 being held in bushes 9, 10 in the wall of the housing and penetrating inside the interior of the output ring gear 8 and serving as supports for the bearings 13, 14 e 15, 16 of the eccentrics 17, 20 , each eccentric 17, 20 being driven by at least one gear wheel 23, 25 , driven synchro nously by the input gear 27 which is journalled in the housing wall, the gear wheels 23, 25 being secured by a pin 50 to a shoulder generated on the eccentrics.
