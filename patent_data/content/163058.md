# High conducting polymer metal alloy blends.

## Abstract
A high conducting polymer alloy blend is prepared by stress blending a polymer having Non Newtonian rheologic al behavior with a low melting temperature alloy to form an interpenetrating polymer alloy network. The blend is per formed at a temperature intermediate the solidus and liquidus temperatures of the alloy where the alloy has a fractional solidus imparting to the alloy a viscosity corres ponding to the viscosity of the polymer. In the resulting blend, the interpenetrating polymer network is the stabilizing component of the high conducting polymer alloy inter penetrating network and the interpenetrating alloy network provides the high conductance path.
