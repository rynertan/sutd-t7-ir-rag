# Video recorder playback machine.

## Abstract
A video recorder playback machine is provided for recording and or playing back video information from an information disc. The machine includes a write laser and a read laser respectively for generating record and playback optical beams which are focused upon the disc by an optical record playback head. An optics carriage movably positions the head with respect to the disc in moving optical alignment with the write laser and carries the read laser in fixed optical alignment with the head. The machine includes apparatus for monitoring the record optical beam during operation in a record mode, and for substantially simul taneous operation in a playback mode to monitor the playback optical beam during the recording process.
