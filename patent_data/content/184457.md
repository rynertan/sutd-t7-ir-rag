# Turbocharger rotor shaft assembly.

## Abstract
A rotor shaft assembly for a turbocharger includes a ceramic solid hubbed turbine rotor 32 having an integral stub shaft 70 interference fit within one end of a generally cylindrically shaped sleeve member 72 . The sleeve member 72 has a hub portion 80, 82 adapted to mate with a piston ring seal 60 and a coaxial bore therethrough. The interfer ence fit, which is defined by a change in the diameter of the bore, gradually reduces the compressive forces acting on the stub shaft 70 . A metal shaft 36 is brazed within the other end of the sleeve member 72 in a torque transmitting relationship.
