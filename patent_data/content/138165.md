# LOAD BEARING MANTLE SURFACE FOR BEARING STRUCTURES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a load bearing mantle surface to bearing structures, in particular to columns, which can be characterized in that a simple or multi layer glasscloth having been impregnated with an adhesive and wound on a crade made of paper or any other suitable material with a diameter being larger, than the diameter of the column or in case of a prismatic cross section larger, than the longest edge thereof, is wound onto the column. Between the mantle surface and the glasscloth a granular material, e.g. sand, gravel or split is filled. On the lower end and the upper end of the column a complementary glasscloth is wound eventually directly on the column and optionally a splicing muff can be wound at the splicing points of the glasscloth having been wound onto the column.
