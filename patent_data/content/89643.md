# Improved polyester type block copolymer composition.

## Abstract
An improved polyester type block copolymer composi tion having a rubber like elasticity, particularly having excel lent heat resistance and water resistance, which comprises a polyester type block copolymer produced from a crystalline aromatic polyester and a lactone in melt admixture with at least one epoxy compound and optionally further with a carboxylic acid compound selected from an ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer and an aliphatic carboxylic acid metal salt.
