# Method of stud welding.

## Abstract
Particularly for securely connecting structures or mechanical equipments to an underwater structure or a land structure in the rain or for mounting anticorrosive members, wherein a tip of the stud held by the welding gun is enclosed by a resilient, heat resisting water sealing member 12 , a weld zone is applied with gas generating agent 6 , said water sealing member 12 is brought in contact with base metal W , an arc is generated by welding current across the stud and the base metal so that an arc heat causes gas generation from the gas generating agent 6 so as to force a quantity of water around the stud tip out of the water sealing member under a gas pressure, and then the stud is welded to the base metal in the absence of water.

## Description
For welding the studs to underwater structure or to the land structure in the rain, it is well known that the portable compact stud welding gun commonly used is enclosed by the water proof case into which air is blown from the exterior to block water flow into the weld zone for effective stud welding. However, such method of prior art has encountered various disadvantages such that the operator mistakes operation, the welding gun becomes disable or the operator is exposed to dangerous electric leak due to flood occurring when the stud welding gun is directed upwards. To overcome such inconveniences, it has already been proposed that, with the welding gun of such type, an outer cylinder is watertightly mounted on the tip of the stud welding gun so as to enclose the stud, then a ferrule and a ferrule retainer are mounted on the open end of said said outer cylinder, and a pressurized gas is supplied from the exterior into said outer cylinder so that the gas blows out through a gap between the stud and the ferrule to expel a quantity of water present immediately below the stud through the open end of the outer cylinder and a sponge mass to the exterior in the form of bubbles. Such underwater stud welding gun is disclosed by Patent Publication No. 57 146. The underwater stud welding gun disclosed in this Patent Publication is certainly advantageous so far as the quantity of water around a weld zone is expelled by the pressurized gas supplied from the exterior so as to make the weld zone substantially dried, thereby a possible flood is avoided even when the welding gun is directed upwards and a possibility of flood due to a wrong manipulation by the operator is also reduced. However, this welding gun requires, in addition to electric wires for welding, control and earthing, an air hose, and correspondingly the operating freedom is inconveniently reduced. Additionally, the exterior equipment is necessarily of a large size, since a source of the pressurized gas is required. Furthermore, fine bubbles discharged through the sponge mass enclosing the open end of the outer cylinder to the exterior during operation makes it difficult to observe a situation of the weld zone and the concentric arrangement of the ferrule, the ferrule retainer, the mouter cylinder and the sponge mass, in this order, around the stud necessarily makes the gun tip of a relatively large diameter, so that it is impossible to perform the stud welding at intervals less than the radius of such gun tip. Moreover, when air is used as the gas, an oxygen partial pressure increases as the depth of water increases and any suitable inert gas must be used, in the place of the air. Such inert gas would be continuously supplied under a pressure to the stud welding gun so long as the latter is present in water and this would be disadvantageous in economic aspect in consideration of a high consumption of the inert gas. A principal object of the present invention is to eliminate the inconveniences that the source of the pressurized gas is externally provided and the air hose of the same length as that of each electric wire are connected to the stud welding gun by the improved and novel arrangement such that the quantity of water around the weld zone is expelled out without any pressurized gas supplied from the exterior to perform the desired welding operation.
