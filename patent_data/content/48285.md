## Description
EMI1.1 tb A SEP PROCESS SEP FOR SEP pPARING SEP A SEP FRlA1iE SEP APDITfVE SEP OO1PO tb SEP TBERMOPLBSTIC SEP FOImIlAT SEP IONS tb This invention relates to a process for preparing a friable composition from paraffinic hydrocarbon waxes, calcium hydroxide and certain fatty acids, or calcium salts of fatty acid, which are solid, glasslike, and remain friable under ambient conditions. These compositions contain a full range of thermoplastic formulation ingredients, including stabilizers. More specifically, this invention relates to ccapositions which, when placed in discrete particles, have a low tendency to fuse or coalesce compared to paraffinic hydrocarbon waxes and which are capable of being used as a single additive for extrusion aids in thermoplastic formulations.Such formulations become fluidized under elevated temperatures on the order of 900C or higher. Thermoplastic extrusion formulations such as those containing polyvinyl chloride, commonly include paraffinic hydrocarbon waxes and calcium salts of some fatty acids, such as calcium stearate, as extrusion aids. These extrusion formulations are generally fed to an extruder as a mixture of particulate solids. It is desirable that any additives to the formulations, including the extrusion aids, be in a discrete, solid particulate form capable of being handled as solids. Unfortunately, the most economically satisfactory materials are also sticky or mushy. This problem was partially solved in the prior art.U.S. Patents 3,883,362 3,883,363 3,979,345 and 3,986,995 teach a method for producing a friable composition suitable for use as an extrusion aid in polymeric extrusion formulations by mixing a paraffinic hydrocarbon wax with calcium hydroxide and a fatty acid, or a calcium salt of a fatty acid, then heating to a temperature of at least 150 0C and thereafter cooling to recover a solid, glasslike, friable composition.These processes were a great advance in the art in that they allowed the use of mushy, low cost, paraffinic waxes instead of the more expensive, high purity waxes. Both types of wax produce excellent results when used in extrusion formulations, but low cost paraffinic waxes were difficult to handle. The prior art thus overcame a major objection in allowing these materials to be handled in a solid, discrete free flowing form with low tendency to agglomerate. These four references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In these references, it is taught that it is possible to incorporate other additives into the compositions when they are employed as extrusion aids or lubricants. These reverences state that other processing aids such as poly e . ylene waxes or acrylate polymers may be included. Also pic ents such as titanium dioxide, fillers, and reinforcing erials can be included. However, these materials did not include stabilizers, thus preventing the formation of a single package for friable composition additives for thermbplastic extrusions. Stabilizers, when incorporated using these processes prevented the product from attaining a friable form, leaving them soft, sticky and mushy instead. It would therefore be of great benefit to provide a method for obtaining a single package of additives in friable, free flowing form for thermoplastic extrusions.The package should contain various waxes, pigments, fillers, reinforcers and stabilizers, the sum of ingredients producing a finished product. It is therefore an object of the instant invention to provide a single package, friable composition, free flowing additives for thermoplastic extrusion. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the description proceeds. It has now been discovered according to the instant invention that a single package, free flowing, friable composition for addition to thermoplastic formulations during extrusion can be prepared by a process comprising mixing a paraffinic hydrocarbon wax with calcium hydroxide and a fatty acid or a calcium salt of a fatty acid while heating to a temperature of at least 1500C, and while at this temperature inserting desired additive materials, including stabilizers which are supported on polyvinyl chloride resins, and thereafter cooling to recover a solid, glasslike friable composition, said paraffinic hydrocarbon wax having a drop melting point oz at least 430C and oil content of not greater than 50 by weight and a needle penetration value of 25 C in the range of 1 millimeter to 20 millimeters, said fatty acid being a C16 to C24 aliphatic hydrocarbon , monocarboxylic acid or mixtures thereof. Stabilizers useful in the instant invention are those normally used in stabilizing PVC resin formulations. Pepresentative examples of such stabilizers are Interstab Chemicals Inc. ET 250 argues Chemical Corp MARK 1900 MARK 1925 MARK 1928 MARK 2115 Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, inc. TM 181 TM 692 M Chemicals, Inc. T 170 T 175 Synthetic Products Co. Synpron 1034 Cardinal Chemical Co. CC 7710 The stabilizers utilized in the instant invention are effective in forming a single package additive for thermoplastic formulation extrusions. Stabilizers as used in the prior art have not been effective in this application because the product obtained is soft and mushy. Such drop ducts are effective lubricants but cannot be easily stored and handled in conventional equipment.Such stabilizers can be used in the method of the instant invention when first absorbed on PVC resins. The composition of the instant invention may be prepared by charging the calcium salt of a fatty acid or calcium hydroxide and fatty acid and paraffinic hydrocarbon wax to a heated vessel equipped with an agitator. The wax can be melted before charging to the vessel. Small amounts of water may be present as is known in the grease art.Under continued agitation, the ingredients are heated to at least 1500C, preferably at least about 1600C to about 16500. During this heatup time, the wax initially becomes molten, forming a continuous phase in which the calcium salt particles are dispersed. After assuming the continuous phase, a subsequent increase in viscosity is noticed until the mass reaches a homogeneous, paste like consistency. As the temperature continues to rise, the paste like mass breaks into separate phases a low viscosity oil like phase and a heavier paste like phase. The heavier paste like phase appears to then form soft bead like masses and the low viscosity oil like phase disappears into these masses. As te temperature continues to rise, the soft bead like.masses se and coalesce into a homogeneous taffy like material. It is at this point that the final temperature of about i600C will be reached and the other additives necessary for the package can be added with agitation. Heating may be continued for a short period of time to insure completion of the transformation, even to higher temperatures just short of degradation temperature. The hot mass, now containing fillers, pigments, and stabilizer is removed from the vessel and cooled to ambient conditions, whereupon the composition becomes a solid, glass like friable material which can be ground or otherwise reduced into a particulate form. The particles formed will substantially retain their discreteness and integrity. The composition is a solid at ambient conditions and can be easily fractured or chopped. However, it is more convenient and somewhat easier to grind the composition under cryogenic conditions. However accomplished, the resultant particulate composition at ambient conditions can be easily handled with conventional solids handling equipment. The particulate composition, containing all additives necessary for thermoplastic formulation extrusion, will maintain its integrity upon standing or being stored. It is emphasized at the outset that the composition prepared with the process of this invention is not a mere physical blend wherein each component contributes its individual properties without any interaction with each other. Rather, the physical form of the composition is unlike either of the individual components. The composition is best characterized as being a glass like, friable solid at ambient conditions, resulting from a synergistic action between the paraffinic wax and calcium salt of a fatty acid or calcium hydroxide and a fatty acid. From a physical chemistry standpoint, it is not known what actually occurs in forming the composition. Broadly, the process of the invention comprises mixing paraffinic hydrocarbon wax, calcium hydroxide and certain fatty acids while heating the mixture to at least about 1S000, preferably at least 16000, adding desired zonmala material and the specific stabilizer disclosed herein7 and thereafter cooling and recovering the solid, glass like friable composition. The fatty acids which may be employed are the C16C24 aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acids or mixtures thereof. These acids are preferably saturated. When mixtures of the acids are used, they may contain up to about 15 weight percent of a C14 aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acid of the same saturation characteristics outlined above.Illustrative of suitable acids are palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, eicosanic, behenic, tall oil fatty acid, hydrogenated vegetable fatty acid, hydrogenated tallow fatty acid, distilled cottonseed fatty acid, and the like. Various commercial grades of suitable acids are available, some of which are listed in Fatty Acids and Their IndustrialApplications by E. S. Patterson, 1968, at Page 7, Table 1 2 excluding high lauric . These suitable commercial acids are generally mixtures of the acids hereinbefore described and may additionally have small amounts of certain impurities depending on their method of manufacture. The calcium hydroxide employed may be any commercial grade material such as slaked lime or hydrated lime. The suitable paraffinic hydrocarbon waxes are generally derived from petroleum sources. These waxes contain a variety of hydrocarbon structures, for example normal paraffins, isoparaffins, cycloparaffins, small quantities of polycyclo paraffins and aromatics and other hydrocarbons and may be in a purified form or may contain oils depending upon their source and or manner,of recovery. The paraffinic hydrocarbon waxes which are particularly useful are those having a drop melting point ASTM D 127 63 of at least 1100F, preferably at least 1450F, an oil content ASTM D 72165T of not greater than 50 weight percent, preferably not greater than 20 weight percent, and a needle penetration value at 770F ASTM D 1321 65 in the range of 1 mm to 20 mm, preferably 1 mm to 10 mm. More specifically, the process of the invention m2o be carried out by charging the paraffinic hydrocarbon v , calcium hydroxide and fatty acid to a heated vessel egttpped with an agitator. The wax may be premelted before being charged or it may be melted in the vessel. The fatty acid may be handled likewise as appropriate. The calcium hydroxide, being a solid, may be charged using any convenient solids handling means such as an auger. Representative examples of thermoplastic formulations which contain these materials are polyvinylchloride extrusion formulations. Representative examples of additives currently used in various thermoplastic formulations are set forth. It is emphasized that these additives are by no means exhaustive of those which can be utilized in the instant invention.However, it is essential to note that the stabilizers incorporated herein must be first supported on PVC resins in order to obtain a friable product. Additives which can be incorporated into the friable compositions include paraffin wax as an external lubricant, calcium stearate as an internal lubricant, polyethylene as an external lubricant, titanium dioxide as pigments, calcium carbonates as fillers and impact modifiers, and stabilizers of choice. Representative but non exhaustive examples of types of methods and examples of which are useful in the instant invention are External Internal Lubricants Paraffin wax Polyethylene wax Oxidized polyethylene wax High molecular weight esters Metal salts Calcium stearate Pigments Titanium Dioxide Carbon BlackFillers Calcium Carbonate Gypsum Calcium sulfate Talc SilicaProcessing Aids Methacrylate polymers Styrene copolymersEMI7.1 M Sn, Sb R1R alkyl groups C1 C12 R2 as beforeX as before The instant invention is more concretely described with reference to the examples below wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.

CONOCO 5385 PVC resin, 1 5 weight ratio, respectively After completion of the reaction the product was cooled to ambient temperature. The product formed a glasslike, friable compound. When ground to discrete particles, the compound remained friable. Example 7 Paraffinic wax 125g Ca OH 2 12. 5g Stearic acid 75g Polyethylene AC 629A 15q TiO2 lOOg CaCO3 500g Physical blend of time stabilizer Cincinnati Milacron TM 692 and CONOCO 5385 PVC resin 1 5 weight ratio respectively 180g After completion of the reaction, the product was cooled to ambient temperature. The product formed a glass like, friable compound. When ground to discrete particles, the compound remained friable. Upon addition of PVC with adsorbed stabilizer the reaction products become homogeneous, taffy like materials. Upon cooling to ambient temperature or somewhat below for best results the product was sufficiently hard to ground to discrete particles. The particles remained discrete and friable under ambient coluitions. Stabilizers are supported on PVC resit simply by blending the stabilizer with an amount of resin sufficient to absorb and or support the quantity of stabilizer used.Normally the ratio of stabilizer to resin will range from about 1 to 1 to about 1 to 100 respectively, but from about 1 to 4 to about 1 to 7 is preferred. In the process of the instant invention, the materials must be heated to at least 1500C in order to form friable compositions. However, temperatures of 1600C are preferred. The process can be carried out when the fatty acid is mixed with a paraffinic hydrocarbon wax prior to adding the calcium hydroxide. However, the calcium hydroxide is preferably mixed with a paraffinic hydrocarbon wax prior to adding the fatty acid. The mole ratio of calcium hydroxide to fatty acid ranges from about 0.5 to 1 respectively to about 1 to 1 respectively. However, the preferred range of mole ratios is from about 0.55 to 1 to about G,65 to 1 respectively. The weight ratio of wax to calcium salt of the fatty acid is normally in the range of frL bout 0.3 to 1 to about 2.5 to 1 respectively. However, the preferred weight ratio range of wax of fatty acid is from about 0.6 to 1 to about 1.7 to 1 respectively. Paraffinic hydrocarbon wax of the instant r tion should have a drop melting point of at least 43 0 but a drop melting point of about 600C is preferred.These waxes should have an oil content of not greater than 50 eight percent by weight but an oil content of not greater than 20 percent by weight is preferred. The needle penetration value at 250C will fall in the range of from I millimiter mitt to 20 millimeters but a needle penetration value from 1 mm to 10 mm is preferred. Likewise, the calcium salts which may be employed are those derived from C16 to C24 aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acid and mixtures thereof. These acids can be saturated or unsaturated. The mixtures of the acids are used that can contain up to about 15 weight percent of theC14 aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acid of the same saturation characteristics set forth. Illustrative but nonexhaustive of suitable acids are palmitic, stearic, oleic linoleic, eicosanic, behenic, tall oil fatty acid, hydrogenated vegetable fatty acid, hydrogenated tallow fatty acid, distilled cottonseed fatty acid, and the like. Suitable commercial acids are generally mixtures of the acids described and may additionally have small amounts of certain impurities depending upon their methods of manufacture. Therefore, mixtures of fatty acids can easily be employed. In addition, the process utilizing the mixture of fatty acids can contain up to about 15 by weight of a C14 aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acid. No one stabilizer need be used alone. Mixtures of these stabilizers can also be used to form a friable composition. While certain embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating this invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
