## Description
MEMORY CELL STORING LOGIC DATA IN VOLATILE AND NON VOLATILE FORMS The invention relates generally to the field of non volatile dynamic random access memory cells. Non volatile floating gate metal oxide silicon MOS memories are well known in the industry. In such devices, the conductive state of the transistor memory cell is determined by the voltage on an associated floating gate. Designs have been proposed which facilitate the erasure and resetting of the voltages on these floating gates. For example, in US A 4,119,995, the floating gate is controlled by separate programming and erasure gates which are disposed above the floating gate and insulated therefrom by an oxide layer. The floating gate voltage is programmed by electron injection from the substrate.The charge on the floating gate is erased by causing electrons to flow from the floating gate up to the erasing gate. Other designs have been proposed which utilize charge transfer between the floating gate and one or more control gates to both erase and program the floating gate i.e., in these designs the tunnelling or avalanche of electrons from a structure other than a substrate region is used to set the voltage of the floating gate . See e.g. Lee, A New Approach for the Floating Gate MOSNonvolatile Memory , Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 31,No. 7, October 1977, pp. 475 476. This paper discloses a single control gate separated from the floating gate by a poly oxide layer. When the control gate is biased positive for writing, electron flow is induced from the floating gate to the control gate. Since this flow is greater than the flow of electrons from the substrate to the floating gate, the floating gate accumulates positive charge.When the control gate is ramped negative to erase, the floating gate accumulates negative charge.See also US A 4,099,196, US A 4,274,012,US A 4,300,212 and US A 4,314,265 which disclose erasable PROM s wherein a programming gate is disposed below the floating gate and an erasure gate is disposed above the floating gate.The devices are programmed by inducing electron flow from the program gate to the control gate and are erased by inducing electron flow from the floating gate to the erasing gate. In all three patents, the surface of one or more of the gates is roughened in order to enhance the induced electric fields. This promotes electron flow through the oxide layers separating the gates. Among the materials which have charge injection properties is the so called dual electron injector structure DEIS , which is a layer of 5i02 having excess silicon crystals on its upper and lower surfaces. This structure is disclosed in US A 4,104,675. DEIS is generally formed by a chemical vapor deposition process which induces extra silicon crystal growth both prior and subsequent to the formation of an otherwise normal Si02 layer. Several patents specifically disclose the use of a DEIS layer as the injector structure for a non volatile memory. See e.g., US A4,336,603. This patent discloses a single control gate which injects electrons into the floating gate through a DEIS layer. This DEIS layer has also been incorporated in providing the injector structure for the non volatile component of a non volatile dynamic RAM. See e.g., US A4,446,535 which discloses the use of DEIS to construct a single control gate of a non volatile element associated with i.e. storing the latent image of a dynamic RAM cell DRAM . Such non volatile DRAMs are also disclosed in US A 4,449,205, US A 4,363,110, US A 4,432,072, andUS A 4,375,085. In each of these patents, the data stored on the floating gate is erased before new data can be stored thereon. This extra operational step adversely affects the operational speeds attainable in these memories. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved non volatile dynamic random access memory cell. It is another object of the invention to provide a non volatile dynamic memory cell in which data can be written into the cell without first erasing the existing data stored therein. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a non volatile dynamic RAM cell which needs a minimum of support circuitry. These and other objects of the invention are realized by a non volatile dynamic RAM cell in which the plate of the storage capacitor is coupled through a layer ofDEIS material to an associated floating gate electrode.The floating gate is also coupled to a control gate electrode through a separate layer of DEIS material. In operation, when a first binary logic state is written into the floating gate from the storage capacitor, the DEIS material induces electron flow from the floating gate to the control gate. When a second binary logic state is written into the floating gate, the DEIS material induces charge injection from the plate of the capacitor into the floating gate. Due to the characteristics of the DEIS layer, the above described charge transfers will occur if the logic state to be written is the opposite of the logic state already stored on the floating gate. No charge transfer will occur if these logic states are the same. Hence, there is no need for an erasure step prior to writing a given logic state into the non volatile portion of the non volatile dynamic RAM of the invention. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of one embodiment of the invention. In the description to follow, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of the memory cell of the invention Figs. 2A and 2B are schematic diagrams illustrating the conductive characteristics of the DEIS layer and Fig. 3 is an equivalent circuit of the memory cell of the invention. With reference to Fig. 1, the structure of the memory cell will be described. A p type substrate 10 has an n type diffusion 12 formed therein via typical ion implantation techniques. Note that these conductivity types are given by way of example e.g., substrate 10 could be made of p type silicon. The n type region 12 constitutes a diffused bit line which is connected through a connector 12A to a bit line voltage source.Substrate 10 is covered by an oxide layer 14. An isolation region ROX 14A is grown during the step, using conventional techniques. Insulator layer 14 is then covered by a first polycrystalline silicon layer, which is etched to form a floating gate electrode 16. A layer of DEIS material 20 is then formed on top of floating gate 16 using the techniques previously discussed, Note that the DEIS layer 20 is only formed on the upper surface of floating gate 16 the sides of the floating gate are oxidized to form conventional oxide layers 18A and 18B, respectively. A second layer of polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the substrate. The second polysilicon layer and the DEIS layer are etched using conventional techniques to form a word line electrode 22, a first control gate including a control gate electrode 24 and a first underlying DEIS region 20A, and a second control gate including a capacitor plate 26 and a second underlying DEIS region 20B. Note that only a portion of capacitor plate 26 overlies DEIS region 20B the remainder of plate 26 overlies insulator layer 14 to form a conventional dynamic RAM storage capacitor. The word line electrode 22 receives a control voltage VwL and acts as a switch in transferring the bit line voltage to the memory cell. The control gate electrode receives a voltage VCG for controlling the voltage state of floating gate 16.Finally, the capacitor plate 26 receives a control voltage VP which aids in controlling both the voltage on the storage capacitor Cs and the voltage state of floating gate 16. In Fig. 1, the size of the portion of storage plate 26 which overlays the floating gate appears to be equivalent to that of the control gate electrode 24. In practice, however, the control gate electrode 24 is larger than i.e. elongated with respect to the portion of storage plate 26 which overlays the floating gate.This size difference effects the respective capacitance of the respective control gates, as will be discussed in more detail below. Prior to discussing the operation of the cell, the characteristic of the DEIS layer will now be reviewed.Due to the electron flow enhancement properties of the surfaces of the DEIS layer with respect to the inner Ski02, each surface of the DEIS layer has an inherent diode characteristic. Since the respective surfaces of the DEIS layer promote electron flow in different directions, the total DEIS layer acts as i.e. provides the electrical characteristic of two back to back connected diodes, as shown in Fig. 2A. As shown in Fig. 2B, it is preferred that the DEIS layer be formed such that these diodes begin conduction at approximately 10 volts.Thus, while the use of DEIS material is preferred, any sort of charge injector material or structure can be used which exhibits the above described characteristics. The operation of the invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 3, which shows an equivalent circuit of the cell of Fig. 1. Switch S1 represents the word line FET, which switches VBL onto the substrate whenVWL goes to 5 volts. CD1 is the capacitance formed byDEIS region 20A between control gate electrode 24 and floating gate 16 CD2 is the capacitance formed by DEIS region 20B between polysilicon capacitor plate 26 and floating gate 16 CFGN is the capacitance formed by insulator layer 14 between floating gate 16 and the substrate 10 CI is an additional inversion capacitance formed between the floating gate 16 and the substrate 10 only when a well region is induced beneath floating gate 16 and C5 is the storage capacitor.For the sake of clarity, the various parasitic capacitances inherent in the memory cell have been deleted from the equivalent circuit of Fig. 3. This equivalent circuit has been found to present a first order approximation of the performance of the memory cell. Prior to describing the non volatile aspects of the operation of the memory cell of the invention, a brief discussion will now be made of its function as a dynamic memory device. To write volatile data into the cell, Vp is set at 5 volts. The control gate voltage VCG is set at 8 volts, which causes the floating gate voltage VFG to rise to 5 volts due to the respective capacitive values of CDl, CD2 and CFGN, as will be discussed in more detail later .After the voltage on the floating gate has stabilized, VWL is ramped up to 5 volts, causing the bit line voltage to be transferred via the word line device to the storage capacitor C5. If VBL 0 volts, the storage capacitor will be grounded and will thus store a n o n logic state if VBL 5 volts, C5 will charge to 5 volts minus Vt the threshold of the word line device and will thus store a 1 logic state. To read the cell, the bit line is precharged to 5V, VWL is again ramped to 5 volts, and the bit line current is sensed. If the storage capacitor is storing a 0 , the capacitor will charge and hence the bit line current will drop. If the capacitor is storing a 1 , there will not be any bit line drop.Thus, the surface of the substrate beneath the floating gate and the capacitive plate functions as a dynamic storage node. The relationships between the capacitances of the capacitors shown in Fig. 3 are as follows CD1 1 2 CFGN CD2 1 3 CDl C1 O. 1 CFGN CS CFGNThese general relationships govern the operation of the cell by controlling the charge transfer through DEIS regions 20A and 20B, as will be discussed in more detail below. The difference between the capacitances of CD1 and CD2 is caused by the above mentioned difference in the respective sizes of control gate 24 and the portion of capacitor plate 26 overlying DEIS region 20B. The non volatile aspects of the operation of the cell will now be discussed for SAVE and GET operations. The SAVE operation causes each of the floating gates of the memory array to store the logic states on its associated storage capacitor. The GET operation causes all of the floating gates to transfer its stored logic state to its associated storage capacitor. This enables the memory array to be written into and read from in the same manner as conventional dynamic storage cells since these operations are carried out with respect to the storage capacitor and not the floating gate . It is important to note that both operations are non destructive with respect to the transferor e.g. after the SAVE operation, the capacitor still retains its stored logic state . To perform the SAVE operation, VWL is forced to ground, VBL is set at 5 volts and the voltage on the control gate electrode is raised from 8.5 volts to 20 volts. After VCG 20V, the voltage Vp on the capacitor plate is lowered to ground. As a consequence, the potential well beneath floating gate 16 increases, and the potential well beneath capacitor plate 26 decreases.If the capacitor is storing a 0 state i.e. no charge being stored , the inversion layer beneath the capacitor plate has its normal complement of electrons. Thus, when the potential well beneath the capacitor decreases in size, electrons will be forced to flow from beneath the capacitor plate to the larger potential well beneath the floating gate. This causes the surface of the substrate beneath the floating gate to become more negatively charged, capacitively coupling the floating gate voltageVFG towards ground potential. If the capacitor is storing a 1 state i.e. 5V charge storage , the inversion layer beneath the plate is depleted of free electrons. No charge transfer to the potential well beneath the floating gate takes place, allowing the floating gate voltage to vary with the control gate voltage which is at a high level . In general, the voltage on the floating gate can be expressed as VFG xVcG, 1 where X is the capacitor coupling ratio. When a 11011 is to be stored, VcG 20V, Vp OV and VFG OV, such thatEMI9.1 where CFGTO CDl CD2 CFGN 3 Assume that X..0 0 ,,0.3 thus VFG 0.3 20 6.0 volts. FG Now referring back to Fig. 2B, we see that the DEIS material will conduct where the difference between eitherVCG and VFG or Vp and VFG is greater than 10 volts. In this situation, VCG VFG 20 6 14 volts. Thus, DEIS region 20A associated with control gate electrode 24 will conduct, removing charge from floating gate 16 and injecting the charge into control gate electrode 24.This charge transfer will continue until the voltage on the floating gate rises from 6.0V to 10 volts. The net charge gain by the floating gate can be expressed as QFG O VFGf VFGi CFGT 0 4 where VFGi 6V and VFGf 10V. Thus, the potential due to the floating gate charge is QFG O CFGT 4V, since CFGT CFGT 0 . If a 1 is to be stored, recall that the inversion layer beneath the floating gate is floating due to a lack of electron flow from the inversion layer of the storage capacitor. This creates a depletion capacitance C1 between the floating gate capacitor CFGN and the substrate. Thus,EMI10.1 Assuming x 1,, 0.7, VFG 0.7 20 14 volts. Thus, with reference to Fig. 2B, it is apparent that 4.0 volts of charge will be injected into the floating gate by the capacitor plate 26 via DEIS region 20B. Again, the net charge gain by the floating gate is 0FG 1i VFGf VFGi CFGT 1 whereEMI11.1 and the final potential of the floating gate due to this charge is QFG 1 CFGT 4 volts. Thus, the floating gate will store a 4V charge when storing a 0 and a 4V charge when storing a 1 . A feature of disclosed memory cell is that the dynamically stored data can be read by the coupling of the data signals to the storage capacitor without concern that the negatively charged floating gage will impede channel formation. As discussed above, the charge on the floating gate is 4V when storing a 1 state.This high negative charge may be sufficient to at least partially decouple the voltage developed on the bit line from the storage capacitor by prohibiting channel formation. However, when we want to read the logic state stored on the capacitor and the floating gate stores a 1 , the depletion capacitance C1 will be removed since the inversion layer beneath the floating gate no longer floats i.e. it is receiving electrons from the word line device . As a result, the voltage due to the stored charge will drop from 4V CFGT1 111 to 1 8V QFG CFGT O , and thus the floating gate will not impede channel formation to a degree which would prevent a proper read cycle. The foregoing description of the non volatile operation of the cell was made with the assumption that the floating gate was devoid of charge when the writing operation was initiated. A feature of the invention is that new data can be written over the old data stored on the floating gate without the need for an intervening erasure of the old data. This feature will now be discussed in more detail. During the discussion, reference will be made to the following relationship VFGN FGO VFGw where VFGN the new voltage of the floating gate at the end of the present writing step VFGw the voltage on the floating gate at the end of the present writing step, assum ing no previous floating gate charge and VFGO the voltage on the floating gate due to the previous charge storage from an immediately preceding writing step. a Cell at 0 state, write in a O Under these circumstances, the voltage on the floating gate VFGN 6V 4V 10 volts. That is, assuming no previous charge storage, the floating gate will be at 6 volts when storing a 0 furthermore, due to the charge transfer in storing a prior 0 , the floating gate already has 4.0 volts of charge stored thereon. Therefore, since the floating gate is at 10 volts, there will not be any charge injection, and the voltage on the floating gate will still be 4 volts. b Cell at 1 state, write in a 0 Here, VFGN 4V 6V 2V. The 4 volts is due to the charge injected on the floating gate in storing a n 1 et previously, and the 6V is due to the present writing of a 1 . Thus, there will be 8 volts worth of charge removal from the floating gate to control gate electrode 24, and the final voltage of the floating gate will be VFG 4V 8V 4V. c Cell at 0 state, write in a 1 Initially, VFGN 4V 14V 18 volts, such that 8V worth of charge will be injected into the floating gate and VFG 4.5 8V 4 volts. d Cell at 1 state, write in a 1 VFGN 4V 14V 10 volts, such that no charge injection occurs and VFG still 4 volts. Once the above described SAVE operation has been completed, the charge on the floating gate is indicative of the logic state on the storage capacitor. Since the charge stored on the capacitor is no longer important, the memory array does not have to be periodically refreshed. In order to read the cell by conventional DRAM techniques, the charge stored on the floating gate must now be transferred back to the storage capacitor. In this GET operation, a 1 is first written into all of the cells of the array by raising the bit line voltageVBL to 5 volts and then raising the word line voltageVWL to 5 volts, while keeping VCG 8.5V and Vp at 5 volts. As a result, the storage capacitor will be charged to 5V VT of the word line device.Note that this step can be completed concurrently with a conventional DRAM refresh cycle by forcing the bit line to 5V. Then, the control electrode 24 is grounded VcG 0 , the bit line is grounded VBL 0 , and then the word line 22 is raised to 5 volts. The floating gate potential is due only to the charge stored on the floating gate. If the floating gate is positively charged i.e.storing a 0 state , a channel will be induced below the floating gate, and the voltage of the inversion layer beneath the capacitor will be forced to the bit line voltage i.e. ground . Hence, for a 0 stored on the floating gate, the capacitor voltage is at ground after the GET operation. On the other hand, for a stored 1 , the negative charge on the floating gate will prohibit channel formation, and hence the inversion layer of the capacitor will remain at 5 volts after the GET operation. Again, this step can be concurrent with a conventional DRAM refresh cycle by forcing the bit line to 0V. The non volatile dynamic memory of the invention can be implemented with a minimum of support circuitry. Only one control voltage veg rises above VDD 5 volts.Moreover, the memory cell of the invention is of relatively simple construction, and hence does not require a large number of processing steps in order to construct. Further, the non volatile portion of the memory cell has an overwrite capability. That is, new data can be written into the floating gate without first erasing the previously stored logic state. This elimination of the intervening erase step improves the overall storage cycle time of the cell. It is to be understood that both structural and operational modifications can be made to the best mode for carrying out the invention as described above without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
