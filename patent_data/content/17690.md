## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing novel hydrocarbon soluble partially sulfonated polyol ester derivatives of a monoethylenically unsaturated C4 C10 dicarboxylic acid material under conditions of reduced sediment formation as well as to the resulting substantially sediment free product useful for preparing ashless dispersants utilized in lubricating oil and fuel compositions.In particular, this invention is directed to a sediment free process involving the polyol esterification of alkenyl succinic anhydride to provide lubricating oil and fuel additives wherein said reaction is carried out in the presence of a sediment reducing amount of an oil soluble sulfonic acid or with an oil soluble partially sulfonated polyol. The invention also relates to the sulfonated polyol ester and lubricating oil compositions thereof. During the past several decades, ashless sludge dispersants have become increasingly important, primarily in improving the performance of lubricants in keeping the engine clean of deposits and permitting extended crankcase oil drain periods while avoiding the undesirable environmental impact of the earlier used metal containing additives. Most commercial ashless dispersants fall into several general categories. One category of ashless dispersants involves the esterification product of alkenyl substituted acids, e.g., polyisobutenyl succinic acids, with polyols, e.g., pentaerythritol, as taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,381,022 however, the usual process of making such a dispersant requires not only an esterification catalyst such as sulfuric acid, benzene sulfonic acid, p toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, etc., see col. 5, lines 68 75 but must be carried out at such an elevated temperature that large amounts, i.e., in the range of 2 to 6 vol. 7 of sediment are formed. Sulfonic acids are also used in other esterification reactions such as the condensation of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride with a tetraalkylol urea see U.S.3,897,456 sulfonated styrene divinylbenzene copolymer exchange resin for the esterification of an 8 300 carbon branched chain alkenyl succinic anhydride with a variety of alcohols see U.S. 4,029,675 and, the reaction of a monocarboxylic acid with a polyol in the presence of methane sulfonic acid see German DAS 2 520 459 and the correspondingU.S. 4,029,675 and 4,025,447 . Sulfonate esters of polyols are known see U.S.2,703,808 for the reaction product of sulfonyl chlorides and pentaerythritol and U.S. 3,579,630 for disclosure of pentaerythritol tetrakis p toluene sulfonate . Finally, a fuel additive is reported in U.S.4,059,414 as the reaction product of an alkyl benzene sulfonate and the derivative of a fatty acid and a trialkanolamine. It has been discovered that the problem of sediment formation in the polyol esterification of an alkenyl succinic anhydride, e.g. poly isobutenyl succinic anhydride, can be overcome by incorporating into said esterification environment a sediment reducing amount e.g. 0.1 to 15, preferably 0.2 to 1.5, wt. of an oil soluble C12 C8O, preferably C24 C36, sulfonic acid or, reacting said anhydride with an oil soluble partially sulfonated polyol having at least one hydroxy group available for reaction with a carboxyl moiety of said anhydride. This invention can thus be characterized in one embodiment as a process for the preparation of a partially sulfonated polyol ester of a hydrocarbon soluble C6 Clo, hydrocarbon substituted Cq C10 dicarboxylic acid material, preferably ClG C150 olefin substituted succinic anhydride, comprising the step of reacting said dicarboxylic acid material, for example, polyisobutylene succinic anhydride, with a polyol in a mole ratio of 1 to 3, preferably 1 te 2, of dicarboxylic acid material to polyol in the presence of a sediment reducing amount, generally from 0.1 to 15, preferably 0.2 to 1.5, wot. , of an oil soluble sulfonic acid, preferably a C18 C30 hydrocarbon substituted benzene sulfonic acid, said wt. based upon the total weight of the reactants. The esterification reaction temperature ranges from 120 260 C., preferably 140 23Q C. and is for a period of from 1 24 hours, preferably 2 10 hours, optimally from 3 6 hours. Provided according to this invention is the oilsoluble both full and partial c12 c80 hydrocarbon substituted sulfonate, preferably a C18 C30 alkyl benzene sulfonate of a polyol, as well as the said sulfonated polyol esters of a C6 C10,000 hydrocarbon substituted dicarboxylic acid material, preferably a C4 Clo dicarboxylic acid anhyd ride, optimally succinic anhydride. Further, it has been discovered that said C12 C80 hydrocarbon substituted sulfonate of a polyol obtained by this invention has utility as a dispersant for a wide variety of applications such as in a shampoo, cutting oil, etc., but preferably as an additive for lubricants. Although not known for certain it appears that the sulfonate of a polyol can be represented in part by theEMI3.1 wherein Y representsEMI3.2 in which X is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, OCH2C CH2OH 31 CH2 nOH or CH2OCH2CH2O nH where n is O to 3, preferably 1 to 3, and with the restriction that at least one X contains a hydroxy moiety, z represents an integer of from 1 to 8 and R1 is a hydrocarbon substituent containing from 12 to 80 carbons.For the full sulfonate of a polyol every hydroxy moiety is sulfonated. The novel compounds described above as effective dispersants which are particularly useful in lubricating oil compositions are also highly useful as dispersants in fuel compositions, such as burner fuel compositions, and motor fuel compositions, for example, in gasolines and in diesel fuels. These novel products of the invention are believed to occur as a result of the reaction of 1.0 mole of a hydrocarbon substituted dicarboxylic acid material with from 1.0 to 3.0, preferably 1.1 to 1.9 moles, of a polyol having about 2 to 8, e.g., 2 to 6 hydroxy groups and containing a total of 2 to 40 carbons in the presence of from 0.1 to 15, preferably 0.2 to 1.5, wt. , all wt. being based on the total weight of the reactants. An alternative to said reaction is reduced to less than 1 vol. , all wt. being based on the total weight of the reactants. An alternative to said reaction is to first sulfonate said polyol by reacting from 1 to 15 , preferably .2 to 1.5 wt. , of said sulfonic acid with said polyol at a temperature from 1000C. to 2400C., preferably 100 to 1400C., for 1 to 4, preferably 1 to 2 hours and admixing with said dicarboxylic acid material for subsequent reaction. These novel sulfonated polyol esters according to the invention thus can be prepared by heating together dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides or simple esters with a polyol such as pentaerythritol and in the presence of an oil soluble sulfonic acid such as a C 28 ave alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. The preparation of a polyol ester of the dicarboxylic acid material preferably involves a reaction of an alkenyl succinic acid analog obtained via the Ene reaction of an olefin with an alpha beta unsaturated C4 to C10 dicarboxylic acid, or anhydrides or esters thereof, such as fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, dimethyl fumarate, etc.The dicarboxylic acid material can be illustrated by an alkenyl succinic anhydride which may contain a single alkenyl radical or a mixture of alkenyl radicals variously bonded to the cyclic succinic anhydride group, and is understood to comprise such structures as EMI5.1 wherein R may be hydrogen or hydrocarbon or substituted hy drocarbgri containing from 1 to about 10,000 and more carbons with the restriction that at least one R has at least 6 carbons, preferably from 10 to 150 carbons and optimally from about 60 to about 100 carbons. The anhydrides can be obtained by well known methods, such as the reaction between an olefin and maleic anhydride or halosuccinic anhydride or succinic ester.In branched olefins, particularly branched polyolefins, R may be hydrogen, methyl or a long chain hydrocarbon group. However, the exact structure may not always be ascertained and the various R groups cannot always be precisely defined in the Ene products from polyolefins and maleic anhydride. Suitable olefins include butene, isobutene, pentene, decene, dodecene, tetradecene, hexadecene, octadecene, eicosene, and polymers of propylene, butene, isobutene, pentene, decene and the like, and halogen containing olefins. The olefins may also contain cycloalkyl and aromatic groups.The most preferred alkenyl succinic anhydrides used in this invention are those in which the alkenyl group contains a total of from 6 to 10,000 carbon atoms and, at least 10 to 150 and more preferably 60 to 100 for mineral oil systems. Many of these hydrocarbon substituted dicarboxylic acid materials and their preparation are well known in the art as well as being commercially available, e.g., 2 octadecenyl succinic anhydride and polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride. With 2 chloromaleic anhydride and related acylating agents, alkenylmaleic anhydride reactants are formed. Preferred olefin polymers for reaction with the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids are polymers comprising a major molar amount of C2 to C5 monoolefin, e.g., ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene and pentene. The polymers can be homopolymers such as polyisobutylene, as well as copolymers of two or more of such olefins such as copolymers of ethylene and propylene butylene and isobutylene propylene and isobutylene etc. Other copolymers include those in which a minor molar amount of the copolymer monomers, e.g., 1 to 20 mole is a C4 to C18 non conjugated diolefin, e.g., a copolymer of isobutylene and butadiene or a copolymer of ethylene, propylene and 1, 4 hexadiene etc. The olefin polymers will usually have number average molecular weights within the range of 700 and about 140,000 more usually between about 900 and about 1C,000. Particularly useful olefin polymers have within the range of about 1200 and about 5000 with approximately one terminal double bond per polymer chain. An especially valuable starting material for a highly potent dispersant additive are polyalkenes e.g. polyisobutylene, having about 90 carbons. Especially useful when it is desired that the dispersant additives also possess viscosity index improving pro perties are 5,000 to 200,000 e.g., 25,000 to 100,000 number average molecular weight polymers. An especially preferred example of such a V.I. improving polymer is a copolymer of about 30 to 85 mole ethylene, about 15 to 70 mole C3 to C5 mono alpha olefin, preferably propylene, and 0 to 20 mole of a C4 to C14 non conjugated diene. These ethylene propylene V.I. improving copolymers or terpolymers are usually prepared by Ziegler Natta synthesis methods. Some of these copolymers and terpolymers are commercially available such as VISTALO , an elastomeric terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and 5 ethylidene norbornene, and NODE , a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and 1,4hexadiene. The polyhydric alcohol used to react with the dicarboxylic acid material and or the hydrocarbyl sulfonic acid can have 2 to 8 hydroxy groups and a total of 2 to 40 carbon atoms and can be represented by the formula EMI7.1 wherein X is hydrogen, an alkyl, hydroxy alkyl, OCH2C CH20H 3, CH2 nOH, or CH2OCH2CH2O nH wherein n is 0 to 3, preferably 1 to 3, with at least one of the X substituents being a hydroxy group and preferably all of the X substituents being a hydroxy group of the structure CH2 nOHi wherein n is 0 to 3. Examples of such polyols are illustrated by ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, dibutylene glycol, tributylene glycol, and other alkylene glycols in which the alkylene group contains from two to about eight carbon atoms. Other useful polyhydric alcohols include glycerol, monooleate of glycerol, monostearate of glycerol, monomethyl ether of glycerol, pentaerythritol, 9,10 dihydroxy stearic acid, methyl ester of 9,10 dihydroxy stearic acid, 1,2 butanediol, 2,3 hexanediol, 2,4 hexanediol, pinacol, erythritol, arabitol, sorbitol, mannitol, 1,2 cyclohexanediol, and xylene glycol. Carbohydrates such as sugars, starches, celluloses, etc., likewise may yield the esters of this invention.The carbohydrates may be exemplified by glucose, fructose, sucrose, rhamnose, mannose, gLyceraldehyde, and galactose. An especially preferred class of polyhydric alcohols are those having at least three hydroxyl groups, such as pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, sorbitol and mannitol. Solubility of some polyhydric alcohols may be increased by esterifying some of the hydroxyl groups with a monocarboxylic acid having from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms such as octanoic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, dodecanoic acid, or tall oil acid. Examples of such partially esterified polyhydric alcohols are the monooleate of sorbitol, distearate of sorbic monooleate of glycerol, monostearate of glycerol, and dodecanoate of erythritol. Because of its effectiveness, availability, and cost, pentaerythritol is particularly preferred. Sulfonic Acid According to this invention, the reactant for inhi biting sediment formation is the oil soluble sulfonic acids which are typically alkaryl sulfonic acids. These sulfonic acids are typically obtained by the sulfonation of alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as those obtained from the fractionation of petroleum by distillation and or extraction or by the alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons as, for example, those obtained by alkylating benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, diphenyl and the halogen derivatives such as chlorobenzene, chlorotoluene and chloronaphthalene. The alkylation may be carried out in the presence of a cata lyst with alkylating agents having from about 3 to about 70 carbon atoms such as, for example, haloparaffins, olefins that may be obtained by dehydrogenation of paraffins, polyolefins as, for example, polymers from ethylene, propylene, etc. Preferred sulfonic acids are those obtained by the sul fonation of hydrocarbons prepared by the alkylation of benzene or toluene with tri , tetra or pentapropylene fractions obtained by the polymerization of propylene. The alkaryl sulfonates contain from 12 to 80 carbon atoms, preferably from 18 to 30 carbon atoms per alkyl substituted aromatic moiety. Particularly preferred is a C28 ave alkyl benzene sulfonic acid having a molecular weight of about 550. The alkylated benzene from which the sulfonic acid is prepared is obtained by known alkylation processes benzene being generally reacted with such alkylating agents as isobutylene, isoamylene, diisobutylene, triisobutylene, etc., or olefin containing mixtures containing from refinery gases.Boron trifluoride is a preferred alkylating agent. As discussed, the sulfonated polyol esters of the invention may be readily prepared by one of several methods.The method which is preferred because of the superior properties of the esters it produces and the reduced formation of sediment can be effected by adding together 1 to 3, preferably 1.1 to 1.9 mole of the said polyol per mole of the dicarboxylic acid material with or without inert diluent and heating with from 0.2 to 1.5 wt. of a hydrocarbon substituted sulfonic acid of 24 to 36 carbons at l2 2600C., preferably 1400 230 C. until reaction is complete by infrared analysis of the product showing maximal absorption for ester. The e water formed as a by product is removed by dis tillation as the esterification proceeds. A solvent may be used in the esterification to facilitate mixing and temperature control. It also facilitates the removal of water from the reaction mixture. The useful solvents which are inert solvents in the above reaction include hydrocarbon oils, e.g. mineral lubricating oil, kerosene neutral mineral oils, xylene halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g., carbon tetrachloride, dichlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, etc. The relative proportions of the polyhydroxy reactant to the dicarboxylic acid material reactant depend to a large measure upon the type of the product desired and the number of hydroxyl groups present in the molecule of the hydroxy reactant. For instance, the formation of an ester of the dicarboxylic acid, i.e., one in which the acid radical is esterified, involves the use of about one mole of the partially sulfonated polyol for each mole of dicarboxylic acid. This invention has made it possible to increase the proportion of the polyhydric alcohol, e.g. pentaerythritol which can be used with the dicarboxylic acid material, e.g. a Cgo alkenyl succinic anhydride. Previously the pentaerythritol had been practically limited to about 1.1 mole per mole of anhydride. With the invention it becomes possible to react from 2 to 3 moles of the partially sulfonated polyol with one mole of anhydride. For the purposes of this invention, it has been found that esters obtained by the reaction of one equivalent of the dicarboxylic acid reactant to 2 molar amounts of the sulfonated hydroxy reactant have superior properties and are therefore preferred. Another approach to esterification is to first produce the partial sulfonate of the polyol and thereafter react this compound with the dicarboxylic acid material generally as above. The method for producing the partial sulfonate of the polyol involves reacting 1 to 3 moles of said sulfonic acid per mole of said polyol at a temperature of 120 to 1400C. for 2 to 4 hours. The hydrocarbon soluble sulfonated polyol ester reaction products of the invention can be incorporated in a wide variety of oleaginous compositions for sludge and varnish control. They can be used in lubricating oil compositions, such as automotive crankcase lubricating oils, automatic transmission fluids, etc. in concentrations generally within the range of about 0.01 to 20 wt.Z, e.g. Q,1 to 1C wit. , preferably 0.3 to 3.0 wt. , of the total composition.The lubricants to which the sulfonated polyol ester products can be added include not only hydrocarbon oils derived from petroleum but also include synthetic lubricating oils such as polyethylene oils alkyl esters of dicarboxylic acid complex esters of dicarboxylic acid, polyglycol and alcohol alkyl esters of carbonic or phosphoric acids polysilicones fluorohydrocarbon oils mixtures of mineral lubricating oil and synthetic oils in any proportion, etc. When the products of this invention are used as multifunctional additives having detergent and antitrust properties in petroleum fuels such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuels, No. 2 fuel oil and other middle distillates, a concentration of the additive in the fuel in the range of 0.001 to 0.5 weight percent, based on the weight of the total composition, will usually be employed. When used as an antifoulant in oleaginous, e.g.mineral oil, streams in refinery operations to prevent fouling of process equipment such as heat exchangers or in turbine oils, about 0.001 to 2 wt. will generally be used. The additive may be conveniently dispensed as a concentrate comprising generally a proportion of the additive, e.g. 20 to 90 parts by weight, dissolved in a mineral lubricating oil, e.g., 10 to 80 parts by weight, with or without other additives being present. In the above compositions or concentrates, other conventional additives may also be present including dyes, pour point depressants, antiwear agents such as tricresyl phosphate or zinc dialkyldithiophosphates of 3 to 8 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, antioxidants, such as N phenyl naphthylamine, tert octylphenol sulfide, 4, 4 methylene bis 2, 6 di tert butyl phenol , viscosity index improvers such as ethylene propylene copolymers, polymethacrylates, polyisobutylene, alkyl fumarate vinyl acetate copolymers and the like, deemulsifiers such as polysiloxanes, ethoxvlated polymers and the like. This invention will be further understood by reference to the following examples, which include preferred embodiments of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A fifty gallon glass lined reactor provided with a stirrer was first charged with 96 pounds of polyisobutylene succinic anhydride of number average molecular weight of about 1300 carbon chain lengths of substituent hydrocarbon group of 35 to 700 carbons dissolved in an equal weight of mineral oil. The charge was heated to 2180C. and 13.2 pounds of pentaerythritol added with stirring. The total charge was soaked at 2180C. for 3 hours after which it was stripped with nitrogen for 1 hour and then allowed to cool at 160 C. after which the system was filtered through a sparkler filter.The product had a viscosity at 1000 C. of 2688 SUS with 2.2 volume percent sediment and a haze of 60 neph. prior to filtering and a sediment of 0.08 volume after filtering and a haze reading of 36 nephelos.EXAMPLE 2 The process of Example 1 was followed except that 2.2 pounds 1.0 weight percent of a mineral oil solution containing 50 percent by weight of a C28 C32 monoalkyl benzene sulfonic acid having a Mn of 550 was added with the pentaerythritol and the temperature of reaction was kept at 1900C. The resulting product had a kinematic viscosity commat 100 C. of 2432 SUS with 0.2 volume percent sediment and haze of 20 neph. prior to filtration and only a trace less than 0.01 volume percent of sediment and haze of 15 nephelos after filtration.EXAMPLE 3 The process of Example 2 was followed except 22.7 pounds of pentaerythritol and 9.3 pounds of said mineral oil solution containing said sulfonic acid was used. The resulting product had a kinematic viscosity commat 1000C. of 7656 SUS and a sediment of 0.6 volume percent prior to filtration.EXAMPLE 4 Three formulated lubricating oil blends were prepared by blending 3.5 percent of the concentrate of Examples 1, 2 and 3 with a lubricating oil blend of two neutral base oils and formulated with a metal detergent calcium sulfonate overbased to a 400 TBN and zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate to provide a formulated lubricating oil. Each of the blends prepared as described above was subjected to the MS Sequence VC Engine Test which is a test well known in the automotive industry. The test is run in aFord engine of 302 cubic inch displacement following the procedure described in the publication entitled Multi Cylinder Test Sequences for Evaluating Automotive Engine Oil ASTMSpecial Publication 315 E . At the end of each test, various parts of the engine are rated on a merit basis wherein 10 represents a perfectly clean part, and lesser numbers represent increasing degrees of deposit formation. The various ratings are then totaled and averaged on the basis of 10 as a perfect compLetely clean rating.The results obtained with the five blends described above are given in Table I.

At this point 1.2 grams of p toluene sulfonic acid was slowly added and the reaction continued for 1.5 hours at 2180 C. with continued nitrogen sparging. After cooling, the sediment volume was found to be 1.8 volume percent. In three subsequent runs, the above procedure was altered to introduce the p toluene sulfonic acid with the addition of the pentaerythritol PE . a When 6 grams was introduced there was such violent spattering and foaming that the reaction could not be continued. b When 3 grams of p toluene sulfonic acid was introduced along with the PE at 1750 C. and the temperature then raised to 220 C. over 1.5 hours the foaming and violence was tolerable. After 5 hours reaction at 2200 C. the resulting sediment was measured at 3.6 vol. . c The procedure of 12 b was followed with 4.4 vol. sediment obtained. The oil soluble partially sulfonated polyols of the invention can be reacted with monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic Ce. g. tricarboxylic acids as well as with dicarboxylic acid materials to yield products with dispersant activity. Particularly useful monocarboxylic acids include oleic, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic and those containing longer carbon chains since all of these acids after esterification with said sulfonated polyols have dispersant activity in oleaginous compositions. Representative of polycarboxylic acids are 2 3 carboxypropyl 1,1,5, 6 heptane tetracarboxylic acid, 2,3, 5 hexanetricarboxylic acid and 1,3, 5 naphthalene trscarborylic acid. Further, these monoand polycarboxylic acids can be reacted with said polyols in the presence of said oil soluble C12 C80 sulfonic acid to produce the related sulfonate esters of said mono or polycarboxylic acids with comparable utility as dispersants for oleaginous compositions.EXAMPLE 13 In a four necked flask fitted with a stirrer, nitrogen sparger and a thermometer was charged with one equivalent of polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride in Coray oil enough to have 50 active ingredient and alkylbenzenesulfonic acid 2 of total charge and heated to 1900 C. Trimethylolethane 1.1 equivalent was added slowly and soaked at 1900 C. for 3 hours with nitrogen stripping, then cooled to 1400 C. and filtered through 1 celite. The sediment before filtration was 0.2 vol. . The sediment without using sulfonic acid before filtration was 0.8 vol. ., large amount of polyol at the bottom of the reaction flask . EXAMPLE 14 Experiment 13 was repeated using 2,2 dimethyl l, 3 propanediol. The sediment before filtration was 0.1 vol. .The sediment without sulfonic acid before filtration was 0.5 vol. some polyol deposits at the bottom of the reaction flask . The polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride described above can also be obtained by the chlorination of polyisobutylene and the reaction of the chlorinated polyisobutyl ene with maleic anhydride. The term pentaerythritol also includes dipentapentaerythritol and tripentaerythritol.
