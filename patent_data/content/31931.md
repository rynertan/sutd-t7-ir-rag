## Description
FILM CARTRIDGE ASSEMBLY WITH PRESSURE PLATE This invention relates to photographic film cartridge assemblies having a disk of photographic film. DE OS 28 09 856 discloses a film cartridge assembly having front and rear walls between which a disk of photographic film is rotatable to align image areas of the film with an exposure window in the front wall. The front and rear walls are formed of a rigid material to protect the film from reasonably expected rough handling. The exposure window in the front wall is large enough to provide access to the film for a camera film support surface. The rear wall has an opening opposite the exposure window which opening is covered by an opaque flexible membrane. Fig. 18 of DE OS 28 09 856 shows a pressure plate in the form of a rigid insert supported by the flexible membrane. The insert is movable into contact with the film to urge the film toward the exposure window when an external force is applied through the opening. With this structure the force is applied by a camera to hold the film flat against the camera film support surface during exposure. The force is relieved for film advance. The flexible membrane performs the dual function of flexibly holding the pressure plate so it can be moved toward the film and of blocking light. Because of stresses imposed by a metering pawl and film drive on other portions of the film disk, flatness during exposure of a portion of a film disk is more difficult to achieve than flatness of roll film or sheet film. Other film types, for example, large format, rigid self processing film units present little or no flatness problem. The rigid insert with the supporting flexible membrane shown in Fig. 18 of DE OS 28 09 856 enables transmission of force more evenly than structures using only a light blocking flexible membrane. With this structure, the film disk is held sufficiently flat for a small format and medium aperture camera. However, if a wide aperture is used with a small format film disk camera, film flatness with this prior structure is not acceptable. Accordingly, it is the object of the in vention to provide a cartridge assembly generally of the type described, but with a pressure plate providing improved flatness of the film disk during exposure. This object is accomplished by a pressure plate having a relatively rigid portion which is positioned between the rear wall and the film and is larger than the opening in the rear wall to form a tortuous light path preventing light from the opening from reaching the film. With such structure the membrane can be eliminated, which allows greater freedom of movement of the pressure plate, which, in turn, allows the rigid portion to lie flatter against the film. It is also less expensive to manufacture than structures in which the rigid member is supported by the membrane. According to a preferred embodiment, the tortuous light path is exaggerated by baffle means on the rear wall and the pressure plate. The baffle means may take the form of a rib on the rear wall extending into a recess on the pressure plate, the recess and rib surrounding the opening. The light path may be made more tortuous by making the opening in the rear wall substantially smaller than prior art openings. A protrusion can be formed in the pressure plate extending into the opening to assure reliability in camera interface. According to one embodiment, the pressure plate may be relatively rigid throughout and therefore movable as a unit toward the film. However, according to a preferred embodiment, it has been found that movement of the rigid portion of the pressure plate is most unrestricted if the rigid portion is supported by flexible legs fixed to the rear wall at their extremities. In the detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention presented below, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a front perspective view of a still picture camera which is suitable for use with a cartridge assembly in accordance with the present invention Fig. 2 is a rear perspective view of the still picture camera of Fig. 1 and of a film cartridge assembly in accordance with the present invention, showing the camera opened for receiving the cartridge assembly Fig. 3 is a front perspective view of the film cartridge assembly of Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a view in exploded perspective of an open cartridge assembly according to Figs. 2 and 3 Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a portion of the cartridge assembly of Figs. 2 4 and a portion of the camera of Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 6 is a detailed front perspective view of a portion of the cartridge assembly of Figs. 2 5 Fig. 7 is a back perspective view of a pressure plate shown in Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a view in exploded perspective of a portion of the camera of Figs. 1 and 2 Figs. 9 and 10 are detailed views of another embodiment of the pressure plate in accordance with the present invention in exploded and assembled form, respectively and Figs. 11 and 12 are detailed view of an embodiment of a locking device for a cover member. The present invention isan improvement of the cartridge assembly described in aforementioned DEOS 28 09 856. Any structure not shown herein may take the form shown in that application. Referring now to the drawings and in particular to Figs. 1 and 2, there is shown a stillpicture camera 1 which is similar in certain respects to the camera disclosed in European Patent Application 80 102 036.3 entitled PRESSURE MEMBER URGING MECHANISM filed on April 16, 1980. The camera front shown inFig. 1 includes a picture taking lens 3, a viewfinder 5, a shutter release button 7 movable along a slot 9, and a manual tab 11 movable along an arcuate slot 13.A locking tab 15 at one side of camera 1 is movable along a slot 17 to disengage from an internal latch 19 Fig. 2 located on a rear door 21 of the camera, whereupon the rear door may be opened for loading a film cartridge assembly 23 into a receiving chamber 25 of the camera. When cartridge assembly 23 is received in chamber 25, a pin 27, coupled to movable tab 11 and extending from an arcuate slot 29, engages cover member drive lugs 31 Fig. 3 in the cartridge assembly.A splined rotatable film drive post 33, projecting into the camera chamber 25, extends through an opening 35 in a central core 37 of the received cartridge assembly.When loading door 21 is closed, post 33 extends into a recess 39 in the door. The cartridge assembly of Figs. 2 4 includes front and rear opposed walls 41 and 43, respectively, joined together at one edge by a hinge 44 Fig. 4 .The terms front and rear are used in this specification and appendant claims with reference to the orientation of the cartridge assembly during actual use of the apparatus described. That is, the front of the cartridge would face along the camera s optical axis in a direction toward the taking lens. Disposed between opposed walls 41 and 43 is a film unit 40, which includes central core 37 and a film disk 45 similar to that described in the aforementionedDE OS 28 09 856. Film disk 45 comprises a moderately flexible but self supporting base sheet formed of, for example, cellulose acetate or poly ethylene terephthalate . The base sheet carries photosensitive elements on one face thereof, thus providing a photographic imaging surface on which a latent photographic image can be recorded and subsequently photographically developed. An opaque cover member 47 is rotatably carried on front wall 41 so that its fan shaped leaf portion 49 can be moved into and out of alignment with an exposure window 51 in that casing wall. The passage of light rays through exposure window 51 and onto photosensitive film disk 45 when the cartridge assembly is not protectively encased by a camera is precluded by means of leaf portion 49 and a separator layer 53.Separator layer 53 is formed of an opaque sheet material and has a framing window 55 aligned with exposure window 51 in casing wall 41. Before the cartridge assembly is loaded into a camera, rotation of cover member 47 out of light blocking relationship with exposure window 51 and window 55 is inhibited by an abutment 57 and tooth 59. When film cartridge assembly 23 is loaded into camera chamber 25, a pin 61 enters the cartridge assembly through an opening 63 to move abutment 57 from alignment with tooth 59. Now cover member 47 can be rotated by pin 27, and film unit 40 can be turned by incremental rotation of splined post 33. This moves successive exposure areas of film disk 45 across exposure window 51. There is a possibility that, because of repeated or prolonged flexing of abutment 57, the abutment will take a set and not return to its locked position when the cartridge assembly is removed from a camera. In such an event, cover member 47 would be free to rotate, and ambient light could enter through exposure window 51, fogging at least a portion of film disk 45. Although a malfunction is unlikely to occur, provision has been made, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12, to substantially reduce even the slight chance of inadvertent opening of the cover member. In those figures, elements which are similar to, and function in the same manner as, elements in the first embodiment have been denoted with the same reference numerals with prime marks added. A second, flexible abutment 56 and a ramped tooth 58 have been added to form a detenting function to inhibit opening of cover member 47 e.ven if the primary latch of abutment 57 and tooth 59 fail. The detent is not a lock and is overeome by a modest amount of torque on the cover member, but it provides sufficient restraint to reduce the chance of inadvertent opening movement of the cover member. The cover member 47 or 47 is shown mounted for rotation about the same axis as the film unit 40.However, the cover member can be mounted to rotate about an axis displaced toward the exposure window 51 from the film unit axis. This construction saves space in the cartridge because the cover member will not extend as far from either axis in its uncovering position. The camera includes a metering pawl, not shown, which extends through exposure window 51 to engage peripheral film disk notches 105 two of which are shown in Fig. 4 . The metering pawl must be removed from window 51 to allow the cover member 47 or 47 to move to its covering position. Although this can be accomplished by shaping the pawl such that it is cammed out of the way by the cover member itself, this solution requires substantial force and can cause jams.As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, a better approach is to provide a cam or lever structure connecting the pawl and pin 27, removing the pawl whenever pin 27 begins to close the cover member and returning it into engagement with the film disk whenever pin 27 has fully opened the cover member. It is known in the art to couple members analagous to pin 27 and locking tab 15 to both open and close a cover member with the same structure which opens and closes the camera. Alternatively, pin 27 can be functionally connected to spline 33 or its drive mechanism to open the cover member in response to the first advancement of film unit 40, with closing of the cover member being accomplished by locking tab 15.Control of the metering pawl for cover member movement can be effected directly by any of these related structures through mechanical designs obvious to those skilled in the art. Rear wall 43 of cartridge assembly 23 has a circular opening 65, opposite exposure window 51 Fig.5 . An opaque, rigid pressure plate 67 is received between the rear wall and film disk 45 and is movable toward and away from the exposure window 51. The pressure plate, in bearing against the ear surface of the film disk, presses the film disk ii contact with a rectangular film support surface 69, projecting from the camera chamber 25 into exposure window 51. Through this interaction, an exposure area of film disk 4i is held substantially flat in an exposure plane coincident with the focal plane of picture taking lens 3. Pressure plate 67 and the adjacent surface of rear wall 43 are shown enlarged in Fig. 6 as they appear before assembly. The pressure plate preferably has a generally square configuration with a pair of oppositely extending legs 91 and 93. Rear wall 43 has a cavity 95 shaped to receive the pressure plate. The cavity may be a recess in the inner surface of the casing part or it may be formed by a raised rib as shown in Fig. 6. Leg 91 has a dimension which is less than the corresponding dimension of leg 93. In the preferred embodiment, that dimension is the width of the leg.The mating portions of cavity 95 correspond to the different dimensions so that pressure plate 67 can be placed into the cavity in only one orientation during assembly. A plurality of stake posts 97 are provided on rear wall 43 adjacent to the leg portions of cavity 95.After pressure plate 67 is inserted into the cavity, posts 97 are partially melted by high frequency vibratory energy to hold the pressure plate in the cavity Alternatively, an inwardly projecting ridge could be provided around at leas a portion of the periphery of cavity 95 so that pressure plate 67 would have a snap fit in the cavity 95. Pressure plate 67 has a raised surface 99 which is aligned with, and conforms generally to the shape of, rectangular film support surface 69 when the cartridge assembly is loaded into a camera. A center extension 101 extends into opening 65 in rear wall 43 so as to be presented to camera mechanism for urging the pressure plate against film disk 45. An annular rib 103 extends into the cartridge 7 , r assembly cavity around opening 65 so as to form, with 9 a recess 98 in pressure plate 67, a tortuous light path or baffle to ,prevent light entering the cartridge casing through opening 65 from reaching film disk 45 . .around the pressure plate. An additional rib 96 surrounding the pressure plate contributes to the tortuous path. The rear surface of the pressure plate may be black to inhibit the reflection of such light. One corner of raised surface 99 is recessed so that the camera s metering pawl may enter the cartridge assembly through exposure window 51 and engage film disk 45 in one of the disk s peripheral notches 105 without contacting pressure plate 67 on the rear side of the film disk. One example of a mechanism for urging pressure plate 67 against the film disk is shown in Figs. 5 and 8. Loading door 21 of camera 1 includes a recess or relieved area 71 which defines a storage plane for a pressure plate urging member 73. The pressure plate urging member is preferably a substantially flat strip of resiliently flexible material, such as poly ethylene terephthalate and includes a tongue 75. The tongue has a forward or leading end 77 which abuts a stop 79, fixed to loading door 21 in recess 71. When pressure plate urging member 73 is moved generally to the left, in Fig. 5, leading end 77 of tongue 75 is held stationary. This causes an iritermediate portion 80 of the tongue to flex and bow out ofthe recess, as in Fig. 5.A slight hump 81 may be provided in recess 71 beneath the intermediate or bowed portion 80 to facilitate such bowing of tongue 75. When pressure plate urging member 73 is moved generally to the right Fig. 5 , bowed portion 80 of tongue 75 substantially straightens, moving back into the storage plane defined by recess 71. Bowing of the tongue establishes a resilient or spring like force in the bowed portion which may be used to return the pressure plate urging member generally to the right Fig. 5 . An apparatus for moving the pressure plate urging member generally to the left is described in aforementioned European Patent Application 80 102 036.3. Generally, an operating pin 82 controls the urging member s movement in accordance with the camera s shutter operation. A constraining plate 83, having one opening 85 from which stop 81 protrudes and another opening 87 through which the bowed portion of tongue 75 protrudes, is secured to loading door 21, over pressure plate urging member 73. When the pressure plate urging member is moved generally to the left Fig. 5 , constraining plate 83 maintains the pressure plate urging member in the storage plane, except for bowed portion 80 of tongue 75 which moves through opening 87 in the constraining plate. Referring to Fig. 5, bowed portion 80 of tongue 75 applies a force to pressure plate 67 which is thereby moved against film disk 45 to press the film disk into contact with camera film support surface 69, projecting into exposure window51 of the film cartridge assembly. Whereupon, the film disk 45 is held substantially flat in the focal plane of picture taking lens 3 for exposure. Figs. 9 and 10 show an alternative embodiment of the pressure plate, referred to by numeral 67 and having rigid central portion in the form of a raised surface 99 with a center extension 101 similar to those of the first embodiment pressure plate 67. A pair of flexible extending legs 91 and 93 have holes 107 and 109, respectively, which align with thermoplastic posts 111 and 113 on the rear wall. The legs 91 and 93 can be made flexible while the central portion is rigid by molding techniques well known in the art, for example, by molding the legs thinner than the rigid central portion or by molding hinges in the legs.However, if the pressure plate is made out of either metal or plastic and raised surface 99 , and extension 101 are formed by stamping, thermoforming or similar process, the central portion will be relatively rigid while the long flat legs 91 and 93 will be relatively flexible even though the entire pressure plate 67 is substantially the same thickness. When the pressure plate is assembled into the cartridge casing as in Fig. 10, posts 111 and 113 are deformed, as by an ultrasonic horn, over the top of legs 91 and 93 to retain the plate. A rib 115 extends into the recess below raised surface 99 to form a baffle structure which contributes to the tortuous light path. With the legs 91 and 93 shaped as shown inFigs. 9 and 10 and fastened to the rear wall at their extremities, only a slight flexing is necessary to provide relative freedom of movement for the rigid portion. This freedom of movement provides substantially improved performance in holding the film flat compared to prior art structures in which the rigid portion is held by a flexible membrane. The pressure member shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7 having shorter legs is essentially rigid throughout, but is free to move in its retaining mechanism. In most instances, it is superior also to the prior art and provides acceptable results at a wide aperture. However, sliding friction associated with the retaining mechanism can in some instances hamper effectiveness and its freedom to move is controlled by stake posts 97, tolerances of which are more difficult to control in manufacture. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 9 and 10 the sliding friction is substantially eliminated and tolerances in retention are better. Thus, this embodiment provides the best results. oth structures are much easier to manufacture than prior structures in which a flexible membrane is fixed both to the pressure plate and the back wall.
