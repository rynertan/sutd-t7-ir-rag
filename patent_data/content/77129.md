# Additive for hydraulic cement mixes.

## Abstract
A hydraulic cement mix including hydraulic cement, aggregate, sufficient water to effect hydraulic setting of the cement, and an additive comprising a mixture of an alkali or alkaline earth or ammonium salt of thiocyanic acid, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium or magnesium thiocyanate, and an alkanolamine, such as triethanolamine, the additive being present in an amount sufficient to increase rate of hardening, and the com pressive strength of the hardened mix. Generally, the additive is present in a total amount of up to about 2.5 by weight based upon the weight of the cement, usually in an amount of between about 0.05 and about 2.55 by weight based upon the weight of the cement, preferably in an amount in the range of about 0.4 to about 0.6 by weight.
