# MAGNETIC HEAD DEVICE

## Abstract
A magnetic head 20 of a magnetic head device has a head guide 21 which has a groove 23 in its side surface. A support table 33 has a recess 33a in which the lower portion of the head guide is fitted. Screws 41, 42 are screwed upward from the bottom of the support table and extend into the recess. The head guide is supported on the screws. An elastic plate 31 which has central and radially extending perforations 31a, 31b at its center portion is mounted on the upper surface of the support table. A portion of the elastic member which defines the central perforation 31a is fitted in the groove of the head guide. The head guide is then biased toward the screws. When the screws are turned, the level and azimuth of the magnetic head can be adjusted. A pressure pad 50 is also adjusted by other screws 64 to be set at a selected position relative to the magnetic head and at a selected tilt angle with respect to the magnetic head.
