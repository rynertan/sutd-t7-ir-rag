# A self trimming sailset.

## Abstract
A self trimming sail set having a principal sail rotating about an erect axis and an auxiliary sail or vane that is mounted downstream of the principal sail. The vane is mounted on a boom that extends from the principal sail so that the principal sail is trimmed as the tail vane moves to its position of mini mum drag. A second auxiliary vane is mounted forwards of the leading edge of the principal sail and is capable of opposing the moment of the principal sail about its own axis as the prin cipal sail is moved towards a stalling position.
