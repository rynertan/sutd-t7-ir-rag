## Description
The present invention relates to a radiation storage means according to the preamble of claim 1. Heretofore, as a method of measuring a radiation emitted by a liquid sample for detecting a radioactive substance substance containing a radioisotope contained therein, there are well known a liquid scintillation counting method wherein the radiation from the sample is converted into fluorescence to be detected by adding to the sample a liquid scintillator composed of a solute fluorescent agent dissolved in an organic solvent. In this method, the radioactivity of the radioactive substance contained in the sample is measured by causing the scintillator to absorb at least a portion of radiation energy emitted by the radioactive substance and detecting light fluorescence emitted by the scintillator. The liquid scintillation counting method can be applied to the case where a liquid sample containing a radioactive substance can be continuously or intermittently supplied. The measurement of a radiation emitted by the sample is carried out by collecting a given amount of the sample and adding the liquid scintillator thereinto. As a method for separation analysis, for example, there is known liquid chromatography wherein a sample solution is introduced into a column packed with a filler such as an adsorbent, an appropriate solvent is then supplied therethrough to develop the sample, and components in the sample are subsequently allowed to flow out from the column and collected. The liquid chromatography can be used for the separation of a sample containing radioactive substance, and the separation and identification of the radioactive substance are conducted by measuring a radiation emitted by an eluate collected through the operation of the liquid chromatography. More in detail, the separation and identification of a radioactive substance in a sample are conducted by collecting the sample containing the radioactive substance which is separated and developed in the liquid chromatography with a fraction collector, adding a liquid scintillator to each fraction, and then detecting light emitted by the scintillator with a photomultiplier to convert it into electric pulses and counting the electric pulses to measure the radiation dose of each fraction. The above described liquid scintillation counting method has such an advantage that the radioactivity can be detected even when the radiation from a radioactive substance is weak such as α rays and β rays, and is a useful means for measuring the radioactivity of the liquid sample. However, when the liquid scintillation counting method is applied to a liquid sample containing a radioactive substance which is supplied continuously or intermittently from the above liquid chromatography, the radioactivity must be detected for every fraction by collecting the sample which has been separated and developed in the liquid chromatography by means of a fraction collector composed of a plurality of measuring containers vials , and then measuring the radiation dose of each container with a scintillation counter. Accordingly, in order to separate and identify the radioactive substance in the sample with higher accuracy by detecting the radioactivity of the separated and developed sample, it is required to use a great number of measuring containers as the fraction collector. This means that the measuring procedures for collecting the sample solution and detecting the radioactivity becomes more complicated. The mechanism of scintillation in the liquid scintillation counting method is as follows A molecule of a solvent in which a solute fluorescent agent is dissolved is initialy excited by a radiation emitted by a radioactive substance in a liquid sample, and then a solute molecule scintillator is excited through impingement of the excited solvent molecule on the solute molecule, or the like. In the course of transferring of the radiation energy from the solvent molecule to the solute molecule, there occur other phenomena such that the energy is transferred between the solvent molecules by interaction between the solvent molecule in the excited state and that in the ground state, or that the energy is transferred from the solvent molecule in the excited state to the other solute molecule than a scintillator by interaction therebetween before the scintillator is excited. The transfer of energy takes place not only through the interaction between molecules such as impingement, but also through such a phenomenon that the scintillator absorbs light emitted by the excited solvent molecule or other excited solute molecule. In the course of the energy transfer procedure, however, there also occurs such a quenching phenomenon that the excitation energy is absorbed by a portion of the solvent molecules or other solute molecules so as to be converted into heat, etc., or that the light emitted by the scintillator is absorbed by a light absorbing substance contained in the sample. The liquid scintillator, which is essential to said liquid scintillation counting method, is expensive and has to be isolated and refined to re use it. Usually, it is difficult to recover the scintillator in a high purity so that it is not generally re used and the measuring cost is increased thereby. Further, there are problems in handling thereof. For example, the used scintillator containing the radioisotope may cause a problem in the disposal stage such as enviromental pollution. Other problems reside in that the solvents employable in conjunction the solutes fluorescent agent are generally limited to certain organic solvents so that there is difficulty in choosing a solvent for a sample, and a specific procedure has to be taken in preparing a sample in the case that the sample is sparingly soluble in the solvent. Since the scintillation mechanism of the liquid scintillator is complicated as stated above, the counting efficiency that is, intensity of radioactivity to be detected is apt to decrease by the quenching effect due to impurities contained in a sample or of the sample In order to prevent the counting efficiency from being lowered by quenching effect of contaminants, impurities and colored substances contained in the sample, the sample has to be carefully prepared, and high skill and much experience are required for the operators. The pretreatment of the sample to remove the contaminants is of importance to the measuring procedure. In the conventional scintillation counting method, the measurement of radioactivity of a sample is conducted in a real time. Namely, it is necessary to continuously measure light emitted by the scintillator for a given time for example, for several minutes to several ten minutes after the sample is introduced into the scintillator solution. If the intensity of radiation from the sample is low, the measuring time i.e., counting time extends to a long time so that it can be hardly said that the measuring efficiency and the handling efficiency of measuring apparatus are sufficiently high. Therefore, in the case that a great number of samples are involved as described above, it is difficult to treat such a great number of samples once, and the waiting period accordingly extends for many hours so that it disadvantageously takes a long time until the results are obtained. Particularly, in the case that the half life of radioisotope in the sample is short, it becomes difficult to measure the radioactivity thereof. Further, in the case that the radiation intensity is low, the measurement becomes more difficult. This means that an apparatus to be used for example, dark current drift of photomultiplier must be stable over a long period of time. To keep the stability of apparatus, an expensive apparatus becomes necessary, or much skill and experience to adjust the apparatus are required. EP A 0 077 678 discloses a radiation image recording system, in which a radiation image is recorded on a stimulable phosphor and then read out to reproduce a visible radiation image. A stimulable phosphor is a phosphor which is able to store radiation energy upon exposure thereto and then emits light in proportion to the stored energy of the radiation upon stimulation with a stimulating ray, such as a visible ray. The recording material is formed of a phosphor layer and fixed on a supporting material. The recording material is circulated and re used to record radiation images thereon. The system comprises a mechanism for circulating the recording material with respect to an image read out section by repeatedly moving the supporting material and the image read out section with respect to each other. An erasing device is provided for eliminating the radiation energy remaining on the recording material after the read out step. A method and device for continuous measurement of radioactivity of substances contained in a liquid is described in US A 3 134 018. The liquid with radioactive substances contained therein is fed in a uniform stream to a strip of adsorbent material in uniform motion. Heat is applied to the strip to evaporate the liquid. Subsequently, the radioactivity of the substances deposited on the strip is measured by a radiation detector. A phosphor laminate and a system for radiation measurement are disclosed in US A 4 380 702. This patent describes and shows phosphor laminates having a fluorescent layer which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein. Further, the laminate has a light reflecting white pigment layer on one side thereof with respect to the fluorescent layer opposite the side exposed to the stimulating radiation for said stimulable phosphor. The light reflecting white pigment layer is provided to obtain an image of high sharpness. These known phosphor laminates are to be used particularly for recording and reproducing a radiation image. The afore mentioned document discloses that various materials, such as glass, wool, cotton or the like can be used for the substrate supporting the phosphor layer. Furthermore, the substrate may have a subbing layer on one surface the surface on which the light reflecting white pigment layer is provided for the purpose of holding the light reflecting white pigment layer tightly. For the material of the subbing layer, a usual adhesive may be used. US A 3 646 345 discloses an apparatus for measuring the primary productivity in situ of an aqueous sample by detecting scintillation fluorescence through surface contact of a scintillator and metabolized organisms carrying labelled carbon fixed photosynthetically therein. This apparatus comprises a filter tape for filtering the metabolized organisms and a scintillator tape, on one main surface of which a layer of liquid scintillator is deposited. The scintillator is brought into contact with the filter tape, the liquid scintillator layer being sandwiched between the two tapes. The two tapes contacting each other are brought into contact with a photomultiplier. The beta particles emitted by the carbon fixed organisms cause light emission of the liquid scintillator, which light emission is detected by the photo cathode of the photomultiplier. The number of output pulses of the photomultiplier is counted and is proportional to the amount of carbon fixed by the organisms. The object of the invention is to remedy the problems arising with the conventional liquid scintillation counting methods. This object is solved by the features of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments are claimed by the subclaims. Figures 1 a and B schematically illustrate perspective views of embodiments of the radiation storage means of the present invention in which a shows a yarn composed of a fibrous material containing a stimulable phosphor therein, and B shows a fabric composed of a fibrous material containing a stimulable phosphor therein. Figure 2 is a schematic view showing an embodiment of a radiation measuring system for detecting a radioactive substance contained in a liquid sample which is dropwise supplied continuously. The stimulable phosphor used in the present invention has the property of emitting light giving stimulated emission when excited with an electromagnetic wave radiation stimulating rays such as visible light or infrared rays after absorbing a radiation. Therefore, the radioactivity of a sample containing a radioactive substance can be measured in such a manner that the sample is supplied onto the radiation storage means containing the stimulable phosphor to cause the storage means to absorb a radiation emitted by the radioactive substance, the storage means is irradiated with the stimulating rays to release the radiation energy stored in the means in proportion to the applied radiation dose as stimulated emission, and the stimulated emission is photoelectrically read out detected and converted into an electrical signal. The radiation storage means of the present invention is particularly employable for measuring radioactivity of a liquid sample containing a radioactive substance which is supplied to the means continuously or intermittently. That is, a radiation emitted by the sample can be continuously adsorbed by the storage means by moving the means in its lengthwise direction and allowing the sample to drop or flow down continuously or intermittently onto the moving storage means to deposit the sample thereon. The radiation energy stored in the storage means can be sequentially read out in the form of stimulated emission by irradiating the storage means with stimulating rays. Therefore, it is possible to separate and identify a radioactive substance with high accuracy by sequentially detecting the radioactive substance in the liquid sample which has been continuously flowed down, such as a liquid sample separated and developed in the liquid chromato graphy. The stimulable phosphor contained in the storage means gives stimulated emission instantaneously and the photometric time of the emission can be set irrespectively of the radiation intensity, of a sample, so that the read out operation after applying the sample to the storage means to allow the means to store the radiation energy emitted by the sample takes such a short time as from several seconds to several tens seconds. Thus, the measuring time can be shortened. In the conventional method using a scintillator, the scintillator is added to each container after collecting a liquid sample with a fraction collector, and the radioactivity of each container is measured by a scintillation counter. Thus, the collecting operation of the sample solution and the measuring operation of radioactivity are completely separated from each other. According to the method using the storage means of the present invention, it is possible to carry out both operations in one stage on line by moving the continuous storage means containing the stimulable phosphor therein in the lengthwise direction to continuously deposit the sample thereon and subsequently transferring said means to subject it to the read out operation of radiation energy stored therein. In this respect, the measuring time can be shortened and measuring procedure can be greatly simplified. Therefore, the working efficiency of the apparatus increases, and the number of measurements per a unit time can be increased. This also means that the radioactivities of a great number of samples can be measured with high accuracy under the same conditions measuring time, temperature, etc. even when a radioisotope having a short half life and a feeble radiation is involved. Further, the measurement of the radioactivity can be carried out with high accuracy under the same conditions only by employing one set of the storage means of the invention and the apparatus used therefor. It is further possible to automate all the operations involved, that is, the moving operation of the continuous storage means, the depositing operation of the sample on the means, the storing operation of radiation energy from the sample into the means, and the read out operation of the radiation energy stored therein, so that the total workability can be further improved. The continuous storage means of the present invention does not employ the conventional scintillator and comprises a material such as plastics, so as to be easily handled. For example, the means has good adsorbing properties for liquid sample e.g., permeability of sample , since the storage means is in the form of a yarn or a fabric made of fibres, so that a radiation from the sample can be efficiently absorbed by the stimulable phosphor contained in the means. After the use of the storage means, it is not necessary to separate the phosphor from the sample and to refine it, so that the storage means can be repeatedly used only by removing the sample therefrom and erasing the energy remaining therein under irradiation with an appropriate light, and the cost for one measurement can be reduced. Thus, the measuring procedure can be further simplified by re using in cycle the storage means in the above mentioned automated procedure. Further, a solvent is not necessarily employed for measuring radioactivity by using the storage means of the present invention, which is different from the conventional liquid scintillation counting method. That is, the selection of a solvent and the preparation of a sample solution required in the use of the liquid scintillator are not always required. Further, the above mentioned quenching phenomena, particularly such as the phenomenon of quenching of the emitted light does not occur in the case of using the storage means of the present invention. It is not necessary to introduce complicated quenching correction determination of counting efficiency for measuring the radioactivity of the sample, and the radioactivity thereof can be accurately measured without being greatly influenced by the measuring conditions, etc. Accordingly, the measuring procedure is more simplified in this respect. Since it is not particularly necessary to remove impurities, etc. contained in the sample, the pretreatment of the sample as stated hereinbefore is not required, and much skill and attention based on the experience are not required for the preparation of the sample. The measurement of the radioactivity of the sample can be easily made further by this feature. The following illustrates the radiation storage means of the present invention in more detail. The radiation storage means can be prepared, for example, in the following manner. The stimulable phosphor, as described hereinbefore, gives stimulated emission when excited with stimulating rays after exposure to a radiation. From the viewpoint of practical use, the stimulable phosphor is desired to give stimulated emission in the wavelength region of 300 500 nm when excited with stimulating rays in the wavelength region of 400 850 nm. Examples of the stimulable phosphor employable for the storage means of the present invention include LnOX xA, in which Ln is at least one element selected from the group consisting of La, Y, Gd and Lu, X is at least one element selected from the group consisting of C2 and Br, A is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ce and Tb, and Ba M The above described stimulable phosphors are given by no means to restrict the stimulable phosphor employable in the present invention. Any other phosphor can be also employed, provided that the phosphor gives stimulated emission when excited with stimulating rays after exposure to a radiation. Examples of the material employable in the present invention to encase or retain the stimulable phosphor include natural polymers such as proteins e.g. gelatin , polysaccharides e.g. dextran and gum arabic synthetic polymers plastics such as polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl acetate, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, vinyl idene chloride vinyl chloride copolymer, polymethyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyurethane, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl alcohol and linear polyester. Particularly preferred are the plastic materials from the viewpoints of the easiness of shaping it and handling the shaped product. The above mentioned stimulable phosphor and the material are dissolved or suspended in an appropriate solvent such as a lower alcohol, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, a ketone, an ester or an ether , or heat treated to incorporate the phosphor in the material. The so obtained continuous storage means containing the stimulable phosphor is in the form of a string or a fabric. The diameter or width and the length thereof and the amount of the phosphor to be incorporated therein can be suitably adjusted according to the amount and density of the sample and the measuring conditions. The storage means has a liquid adsorbing property. The liquid adsorbing property can be imparted to the means not only by making it in a liquid adsorbing structure, but also by processing the surface of the instrument. The material containing the stimulable phosphor is spun into a fibrous material in a known shaping procedure and the fibrous material is processed to obtain a yarn e.g., twine having the desired thickness and length alternatively, said fibrous material is processed to obtain a fabric having an appropriate thickness and width. The diameter and length of the so produced fiber containing the stimulable phosphor and the amount of the phosphor to be incorporated therein can be suitably selected according to the characteristics of the aimed storage means and the measuring conditions. The following surface processing may he applied to increase liquid adsorbing property of the yarn or fabric. Surface activation treatment may be performed by a chemical treatment with a reagent such as an acid, an alkali or an etching agent a physical treatment such as a surface roughening treatment an electrical treatment such as corona discharge, high frequency discharge, glow discharge or activated plasma discharge a treatment with ultraviolet rays or laser beam a flame treatment and an oxidation treatment with ozone and the like. Various materials can be employed for the liquid adsorbing layer to receive the aimed sample solution. The materials employable to receive sample solutions ought to be those capable of adsorbing the liquids through a physical adsorbing mechanism such as capillarity, and examples of such materials include a fibrous materials such as a paper e.g., filter paper and fabrics e.g., materials of cellulose deriva tives, gauze and porous materials such as porous polymers, porous glass and porous glass like materials. There may be also employed materials which can be swollen with a solvent of the sample solution, thereby it can absorb the sample solution. Further, in the case that the solvent of sample solution is a hydrophilic one such as water, examples of the materials of the liquid adsorbing layer include natural polymer materials such as gelatin, starch, agarose, cellulose, and their derivatives and synthetic polymer materials such as synthetic homopolymers for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate and synthetic copolymers resulting from the copolymerization of a hydrophylic monomer having a hydrophilic group such as a hydroxyl or carboxyl group with a hydrophobic monomer for example, unsaturated ethylenic monomers such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, methacrylate, acrylate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride and dienes such as butadiene, isoprene, isobutylene . In the case of a lipophilic solvent is involved as the solvent of the sample solution, examples of the material of the liquid adsorbing layer include synthetic polymer materials such as nylon, polyethylene and polyester, in addition to those described above. The provision of the liquid adsorbing layer on the shaped product can be done, for example, by coating the surface of the shaped product with a solution of the above material dissolved in water or other solvent, or a latex dispersion or by fixing said material thereon with an adhesive agent. The thickness of the liquid adsorbing layer varies depending on the kind and amount of the radioactive substance contained in the sample, the kind of the solvent, etc., which can be chosen according to the purpose and is preferably in the range of several µm to several mm. It is preferred that the liquid adsorbing layer is transpa rent from the viewpoint of transmissibility of stimulating rays and stimulated emission. In order to increase the adhesion of the liquid adsorbing layer to the shaped product, the surface thereof may be subjected to such an activation treatment as mentioned above. A plurality of the liquid adsorbing layers may be formed on the surface of the shaped product. It is not necessary that the storage means is actively processed all over the surface. The above mentioned embodiments of the radiation measuring instrument are provided only to illustrate the present invention, It is not necessary that the stimulable phosphor is dispersed in the measuring instrument throughout the length of the material. The phosphor may be partly incorporated in the means. For example, the phosphor may be incorporated therein at regular intervals in the lengthwise direction. A method for detecting a radioactive substance by using the continuous radiation storage means containing the stimulable phosphor of the present invention will be briefly described, referring to an embodiment of a measuring system shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a radiation measuring system for detecting a radioactive substance present in a sample which is allowed to drop continuously. Samples to be measured are liquid samples containing radioactive substances, which may be solutions or dispersions, and may be colored. As radiations emitted by radioactive substances in the samples, any radiations such as rays,β rays, γ rays, proton beam, neutron beam, meson beam, cosmic rays and other rays can be measured. Namely, any radiations emitted by an radionuclides can be measured. A liquid sample 3 in a sample supplier 2 is allowed to drop from the bottom of the supplier on a continuous storage means 1 containing a stimulable phosphor. The storage means 1 is moved in the direction of an arrow 4 and the sample deposited part Of the storage means 1 enters a radiation energy storage section 5. In the radiation energy storage section 5, at least a portion of the radiation energy emitted by a radioactive substance in the sample is absorbed by the storage means 1 and stored therein. The storing time of radiation energy varies depending on the intensity of a radiation emitted by the radioactive substance in the sample, the concentration of said substance, the shape of the storage means, the intensity of stimulated emission from the means, etc., but usually ranges from several seconds to several tens of seconds. Hence, the moving speed is so adjusted to coincide with the transit time through the storage section 5 with the storing time. If desired, the drying of the sample may be simultaneously conducted in the storage section 5 by warming the storage means 1 and the like. The sample deposited part of the storage means 1 leaving the storage section 5 is moved in the direction indicated by an arrow 6 and enters a read out section 7, where the sample deposited part of the means 1 is irradiated with stimulating rays 9 radiating from a light source 8. It is preferred that the stimulating rays 9 has a beam diameter of at least a size Corresponding to the width of the sample deposited part in perpendicular to the moving direction. When the sample deposited part of the storage means 1 is irradiated with stimulating rays, said part emits light gives stimulated emision being proportional to the radiation energy stored therein. Then, the emitted light enters a photosensor 10 such as photomultiplier. The photosensor 10 is provided with such a filter that allows only light in the wavelength region of the stimulate emission to pass therethrough and cuts off light in the wavelength region of the stimulating rays, so as to detect only the stimulated emission. The emitted light detected by the photosensor 10 is converted into an electric signal, which is then amplified to an appropriate level by an amplifier 11 and input into a recording or displaying device 12. In the device 12, the level of the electric signal corresponding to the radiation dose absorbed by the storage means for example, the counted value of an electric pulse is displayed as a digital value. As the recording or displaying device 12, various devices based on various systems can be employed, for example, a device for optically recording by scanning a photosensitive material with laser beam, etc., a device for electronically displaying on CRT, etc., a device for printing a radiation image displayed on CRT by means of a video printer, and a device for recording on a heat sensitive recording material by using thermic rays. It is possible that the intensity of radioactivity is calculated on the basis of the resulting digital value according to read out efficiency luminance efficiency of stimulated emission previously input and the storing time of radiation energy, by providing a data processing circuit within the device 12. Further, by inputting the intensity of radioactivity per 1 mole of the radioactive substance, the amount or the concentration of the radioactive substance for each sample deposited part can be calculated and then the resulting data can be displayed and recorded. In the above described method, the operation for reading out radiation energy of the sample stored in the radiation storage means containing the stimulable phosphor has been described in detail, but it will be understood that modifications can be made and another operation than that exemplified above can be used. The storage means 1 leaving the read out section 7 is wound around a wind up device 13 to hold it. The method for detecting the radioactive substance which employs the storage means of the present invention is not limited to that described above, but other methods may be used. For example, the sample portions from which the radioactive substance is detected can be collected before the sample deposited storage means is wound up, so that the aimed radioactive substance is efficiently separated. Further, the measuring procedure can be wholly automated by presetting the moving speed of the measuring instrument, the dropping speed of the liquid sample, the read out speed thereof, the dropping position of the sample thereonto and the read out position of the energy stored therein. The used storage means containing the stimulable phosphor can be re used by washing it with an appropriate solvent and irradiating it with light to erase the remanning energy. Therefore, the means can be continually re used by incorporating the washing operation of the used means and the erasing operation of the remaining energy after read out operation in the process of the measuring procedure to automate the measuring procedure. Alternatively, when the washing operation of the storage means done after allowing the instrument to absorb and store radiation energy, the succeeding read out operation of stimulated emission from the instrument can be easily conducted with high accuracy, for example, in the case that the sample is colored. The method cf detecting a radioactive substance using the radiation storage means of the present invention is preferably applied to the case of measuring of a small amount of liquid sample supplied continuously, and it is possible to detect the radioactive substance contained in the sample with high accuracy and in short time. Particularly, the method is applied to liquid samples separated and developed in a column, and radioactive Substances in the samples can be separated and identified with high accuracy.
