# Device for displaying television pictures and deflection unit therefor.

## Abstract
A device for displaying television pictures comprising a display tube 1 in the neck of which a gun system 3 is disposed for emitting at least one electron beam towards a display screen 4 , and comprising an electromagnetic de flection unit 6 which is provided around a portion of the display tube 1 and which comprises a first deflection coil 9 12 and a second deflection coil 7, 8 situated coaxially with respect to the first deflection coil, each having two coil units located diametrically opposite each other. Each coil unit of the first deflection coil consists of a main coil unit 11, 12 and a sub coil unit 9, 10 which are arranged axially with respect to each other, the sub coil units being located adja cent the gun system and having a winding distribution for generating a dipole deflection field in combination with a positive sixpole deflection field, the main coil units being located on the display screen side of the sub coil units and having a winding distribution for generating a dipole field in combination with a negative sixpole field at their end remote from the display screen and a positive sixpole field at their end facing the display screen.
