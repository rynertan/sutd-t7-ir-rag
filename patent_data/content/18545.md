# Bottle cleaning device.

## Abstract
The method foresees an alternate vertical movement of the bottles which are made rotate at same time. The cleaning of the bottles is obtained by virtue of rotat ing brushes 23 inserted inside the bottles and of hot water jets on the inside and on the outside of the bottles. The device, which works automatically, comprises two vertical movable frames 8, 17 the upper frame 8 supports the overturned bottle, which is made rotate by an elastic bursh 23 inserted into it this brush is fastened to a hollow shaft 24 , which feeds the cleaning water into the bottle. This shaft is sur rounded by a sleeve 20, 21 which is fastened to the inner frame 17 and houses the brush 23 when the bottle is introduced in or removed from the machine. A pipe 35 placed at the outside of the bottle has three nozzles 32, 33, 34 which throw water jets on the bottom and on the labels of the bottle a fixed comb 26,27 scrapes off the labels.

## Description
Improved method and device for the cleaning of bottlesThe invention concerns an improved method and device for the cleaning of bottles, that is to say a new methoo oc cleaning bottles and a new machine suitable for the automatic execution according to the method itself of the cleaning operations of bottles such as those used for wine, which need an accurate cleaning at the inside and, moreover, suitable for the operations of removing the labels from wine, mineral wa ter and other bottles1The application field of the new method and new machine being still at a handicraft level, where the introduction and removal of the bottle are made by hand by the operator,The prior state of art comprises a method and a machine alrea dy subject of the Italian patent application non 40024 A 78 dated February Ist, 1978 in the name of the same inventoryThe method according to that patent application foresaw the introduction of the overturned bottle neck into the fixed sleeve by the operator, tl is sleeve housing the inner brushes provoked to come out of the sleeve by manual or automatic ver tical movement of the corresponding motor underneath and the cleaning of the bottle by means of an alternate vertical movement of the bottle caused by hand by the operator before letting it go in order to allow it to be drawn into rotation by said brushes8 In the corresponding machine the sleeve hous ing the inner brushes was fixed vertically on the platform, which was fastened to the frame of the machine itself at the inside of the sleeve the tube arranged on the extension of the crankshaft supporting and moving said brushes as well as feeding cold water into the inside of the bottle was sliding the movement of said tube was obtained by shifting manually or pneumatically in vertical direction the motor sup portn The bottle was surrounded by a brush formed by a helical core equipped with bristles, the turn of which with minor diameter leaning on said platform, served as a support for the upturned bottle neck Thus the helical brush carried out the outward cleaning of the bottle owing to a lateral cold water spray, the bottle being dragged into rotation by the inner brushesatThe assembly of helical brush and spry yin tu be was contained in a protection envelope arranged on the platform, to which the upper end of the brush was fastenedIn the case of two station machines, both stations operated simultaneously This prior state of art is liable to further improvements concerning the reduction of the manual operations, the reduction of idle times and the necessity of removing one or more labels, generally very tough, from the bottles From the afore said derives the necessity of solving the technical problem of finding a new method of cleaning the bottles, which allows the necessity of moving the bottle alternately by hand in vertical direction for its cleaning to be eliminat ed the shifting of the motor to be eliminated,the idle times as well as the operator fatigue to be reduced and the rotation of the bottle to be made smoother8 The machine for the realization of this method must, moreover, be able to elimi nate the labels and to improve the quality of the inner and outer cleaning8The invention solves said technical problem by adopting a method, which foresees the manual introduction of the overturned bottle into a rotating centering support, which has only a minimum of friction, as well as the automatic out co ming movement of the inner brushes and the alternate vertical movement of the bottle up to the quick outflow of the cleaning water the whole being associated with the hot water cleaning, particularly by means of hot water jets under pressure directed against the bottom and label areas, which are, moreover, subjected to a balanced scraping action the machi ne, which carries out this method, foresees two stations with continuous and out of fase working in prder to eliminate the idle times each station foresees mainly a frame supporting the bottle and vertically movable in a coordinated way with another movable frame below, which supports the sleeve housing the inner brushes side centering rings of the bottle body and a pair of upper side stabilizing wheels of same a rotating bushing centering the edge of the bottle neck and a radial lateral brush scraping the outside of the bottle the whole being arranged on the bottle support frame some upwardly inclined radial holes made towards the upper end of the tube contained within the sleeve for the cleaning of the inside of the bottle neck three lateral .nozzles fed with hot water under pressure the highest of which is down wardly tilted in order to clean the concave bottom of the bottle a cock limiting the quantity of water introduced in to the bottle in order to shorten the time of its discharge a fixed motor driving to rotate the tube which supports the inner brushes and conducts the water in the bottle, passing at the inside of said sleeveThe advantages obtained by this invention are greatly increased speed of cleaning the bottles, as such a machine ena bles only one operator to wash even one thousand bottles in an hour improved inner and outer cleaning quicker emptying of the cleaning water from the bottle complete elimination of the labels by using hot water, which is more economical than steam used for this purpose unti I now keeping of the motor in a fixed position8Some ways of carrying out the invention are illustrated just to give.an example in the four enclosed drawing ta bles, in which Figure 1 is a
