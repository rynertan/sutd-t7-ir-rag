# Apparatus and method for regenerating spent photographic bleach fixer solution and for recovering silver therefrom.

## Abstract
An apparatus for regenerating a spent photographic bleach fixer solution, comprising a an electrodialysis cell 21 including a cathode 22 , an anode 23 , and alternating anion exchange membranes 24 and cation exchange membranes 25 arranged therebetween to define a cathode compartment 26 , a plurality of intermediate enionation 28 and deionation 29 compartments with a set of the deionation compartments 29 alternately disposed between a set of the enionation compartments 28 , and an anode compartment 27 , b an electrolysis cell 38 connected to the enionation compartments 28 of the electrodialysis cell 21 so that an aqueous solution capable of dissolving silver salts can be circulated between the electrolysis cell 38 and the enionation compartments 28 , c a circulating tank 30 for the spent bleach fixer solution connected to the deionation compartments 29 and the anode compartment 27 of the electrodialysis cell 21 for circulating the spent bleach fixer solution between the circulating tank 30 and both the deionation compartments 29 and the anode compartment 27 , and d a circulating tank 34 for an electrolyte solution connected to the cathode compartment 26 of the electrodialysis cell 21 for circulating the electrolyte solution between the circulating tank 34 and the cathode compartment 26 and a method for regenerating a spent photographic bleach fixer solution using said apparatus.
