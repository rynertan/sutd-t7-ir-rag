## Description
This invention relates to antipruritic plasters containing glycyrrhetinic acids as essential medical component. Glycyrrhetinic acid is the hydrolyzed product of glycyrrhizin glycyrrhizic acid which is an extract component of Glycyrrhizae Radix it possesses antiphlogistic activity and antipruritic activity,and is frequently used as therapeutic agent for eczema, dermatitis neurotica, and pruritus cutanea. Glycyrrhetinic acid itself is easily soluble in pyridine and somewhat soluble in ethanol and chloroform but is almost insoluble in fats and oils, hydrocarbons, and water, which makes satisfactory preparations thereof difficult to achieve. In the treatment of pruritus cutanea such as skin disease and insect bites it is necessary to select a form of preparation suitable for the cause of the itching, various skin symptoms etc. However, in solutions, the solvent is evaporated off by the body heat to deposit crystals, whereby the medical effect obtained,and also its durability, are insufficient. On the other hand, in ointments, etc., the deposition of crystals of medicament is unavoidable when the medical component has poor compatibility with the base, and hence the medical effect and its durability are again poor an ointment also has the defect that it stains clothes due to its stickiness. A plaster may be considered as a form of preparation having no such defects but such a product is not known for the antipruritic agents used in this invention. It is known that glycyrrhetinic acid is soluble is crotamiton and fatty acid dialkylamides such as capric acid N,N dimethylamide, etc., Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 25,404 67 and 2,5406 67 ,but as preparations of glycyrrhetinic acid, there are presently known only a solution of glycyrrhetinic acid in a volatile solvent such as ethanol, etc., an ointment mainly composed of the acid and polyethylene glycol, and a hydrophilic ointment mainly composed of the acid and a carboxyvinyl polymer see, for example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 25,405 67 and 25,406 67 Japanese Patent Publication OPI No. 47,520 74 OPI indicating herein an unexamined published patent application open to public inspection . For glycyrrhetinic acid esters and salts thereof having improved water or oil solubility, various forms of preparation are known Japanese Patent Publication OPI Nos. 149,222 82 and 27,815 84 but the form of a plaster is not known. The percutaneous administration of various medicaments, in particular, steroid hormones, nonsteroidal antiflammatory agents, antibacterials, antitumor agents, etc., has hitherto been attempted. For example, U. S. Patent No. 4,307,717 and European Patent No. 72,251 describe antipruritic agents such as benzoin, calamine, camphor, menthol, phenol, sulfur, etc., and suggest that these antipruritic agents can be used in the form of a flexible liquid absorbent or an adhesive bandage for antipruritic purposes, but the techniques disclosed therein cannot be applied to water insoluble glycyrrhetinic acid. Japanese Patent Publication OPI Nos. 15,861 83 105,915 83 and 36,608 84 describe that glycyrrhetinic acid and similar materials can be widely used as medicaments in specific bases for medicines for external application, but there is no description of practical preparations and the techniques described cannot be applied as they are to glycyrrhetinic acid which is insoluble in water and scarecely soluble in fats and oils. Previously, plasters using glycyrrhetinic acid and related compounds as antipruritics have not been known. GB A 2045618 discloses a plaster in which medicament not glycyrrhetinic acid or related compound is in a base comprising thermoplastic elastomer, oil or higher fatty acid, and tackifying resin e.g.rosin . JP A 5927978 describes use in an adhesive tape of a minor amount of glycyrrhetinic acid in ethanol solution as penetration assistant for the analgesic and anti inflammatory dry indometacin in an acrylic resin binder. From investigations on the compatibility of glycyrrhetinic acid with various bases or other medicaments for developing antipruritic plasters containing glycyrrhetinic acid as the antipruritic medical component, we have found that an ordinary ointment base such as a carboxyvinyl polymer has poor affinity for plaster and is difficult to use as it is for the preparation of plaster. On the other hand we have found that crotamiton,which is known to have good compatibility with glycyrrhetinic acid but was of unknown affinity for plaster base and had never been used for plasters shows good affinity for plasters using rubber compound adhesive plaster bases or acrylic resins. Furthermore, we have discovered that glycyrrhetinic acid is soluble not only in crotamiton but also in benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, diphenhydramine, and chlorpheniramine at a solubility higher than 10 , and in diethylene glycol monoethyl ether at a solubility higher than 6 , and that when such solution is compounded with a plaster base, the medicament can show good compatibility without deposition of crystals thereof. Since benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, diphenhydramine, and chlorpheniramine not only increase the affinity of glycyrrhetinic acid with plaster base but also have local anesthetic and antipruritic actions themselves, they have great merit as compounding agents for antipruritic agents. The present invention has been accomplished based on the new knowledge about the compatibility of three components glycyrrhetinic acid, solvent therefor, and plaster base leading to the provision for the first time of a glycyrrhetinic acid plaster. It has also been found that this new knowledge applies also to glycyrrhizin and monoammonium glycyrrhizinate which show the same medical effect as glycyrrhetinic acid and are insoluble in water, fats, oils, and hydrocarbons,and to dipotassium glycyrrhizinate which has the same medical effect as glycyrrhetinic acid and shows an improved solubility in water but also inferior solubility in fats and oils and hydrocarbons. Where the context allows, the term glycyrrhetinic acids herein is to be understood as including not only glycyrrhetinic acid but also glycyrrhizin, and salts of glycyrrhrizin. The invention provides an antipruritic plaster comprising a backing having formed on one surface a pressure sensitive layer containing The invention also provides an adhesive medicament mass of components 1 , 2 and 3 above. The antipruritic plaster of this invention can be a self adhesive plaster prepared by coating a backing such as flannel, plastics film, nonwoven fabric, etc., with an adhesive mass containing the aforesaid necessary components and can take various forms such as sheet, film, tape, patch, etc. The antipruritic plaster of this invention may contain glycyrrhetinic acids as at least one antiflammatory and antipruritic component and can include other antipruritic component s and or other medical effect component s . Among the solvents for dissolving glycyrrhetinic acids, benzyl alcohol and phenethyl alcohol possess both a local anesthetic and an antipruritic action, and further the antihistamine agents such as diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, etc., and crotamiton possess an anti pruritic action, and hence they can be used with advantage in the present invention. Amongst other medicaments which may be compounded in the antipruritic plasters of this invention in addition to the glycyrrhetinic acids there are those which do not dissolve the latter but do not hinder their compatibility with the plaster base and solvent. Examples are antihistamic salts of diphenhydramine e. g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride , salts of chlorpheniramine e. g., chloropheniramine maleate , etc. antibacterials such as chlorhexidine gluconate, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, dequalinium chloride, isopropylmethylphenol, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, etc. and odorants such as menthol, etc., which do not possess an antipruritic effect but may be desired. A suitable compounding amount of glycyrrhetinic acids for sufficient anti inflamatory and antipruritic action is e.g. 0.5 to 10 , preferably 1 to 4 , by weight of the total medicament containing adhesive mass when the latter contains no other medicament or solvent having medicinal action and is e.g. 0.1 to 5 , preferably 0.2 to 2 , by weight of said total mass when the latter does contain other medicament and or solvent having medicinal action. The amount of solvent 2 used is suitably 3 to 20 parts by weight per 1 part by weight of glycyrrhetinic acid for dissolving it may be e.g. 1 to 20 , preferably 5 to 15 , by weight of the total medicament containing adhesive mass. For producing the anti pruritic plaster of this invention, glycyrrhetinic acids and optionally other medical effect component or components can be dissolved in at least one solvent selected from benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and crotamiton, optionally with co solvent N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, lauric acid diethanolamide or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and the solution uniformly kneaded with the plaster base to form a medicament containing adhesive mass. The compounding amount of the total medicament component glycyrrhetinic acid and any other medical effect component or components is e.g. 1.5 to 30 , preferably 3 to 20 , by weight of the total adhesive mass. As the plaster base, one containing rubber compound adhesive plaster base, tackifying agent, and softener as the necessary components, or one containing acrylic resin as the necessary component,is used. As the rubber compound adhesive plaster base, there are natural rubber and synthetic rubbers such as styrene butadiene copolymer elastomer, styrene isoprene styrene copolymer elastomer, silicone rubber, etc. As the tackifying agent or component, there are petroleum resins such as Quintons registered trade name, aliphatic petroleum resin, made by Nihon Zeon K. K. , Alcone registered trade name, alicyclic petroleum resin, made by Arakawa Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. , etc., rosin, hydrogenated rosin, ester gum etc. As the softener there are polybutene, liquid paraffin, higher fatty acid esterssuch as isopropyl myristate, etc., silicone oils, vegetable oils etc. Optional additives in the adhesive mass of the plasters of this invention include, for example, anti oxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole, guaiacol esters, butylated hydroxytoluene BHT , nordihydroguaiaretic acid, etc. antiseptics such as thymol, etc. and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether as a solubilizer. Polybutene is itself tacky and hence functions as a tackifying component but can be used as a softener since it softens a rubber component without the need for other softener. When an acrylic resin such as an acrylic acid acrylic acid ester series polymer, for example, Primal For producing the medicament containing adhesive mass a solvent, hot melts, or emulsion method, etc., is usually used. In one solvent method, a solution of glycyrrhetinic acid in above described specific solvent is dissolved in mixed with further organic solvent and is mixed with a solution of above described base in further organic solvent and the mixture is uniformly kneaded. As the further solvent s for dissolving mixing with the solution of the glycyrrhetinic acid and dissolving the base, an organic solvent which has compatibility with the base and does not deposit crystals when mixed with the solution of the glycyrrhetinic acid is selected. Examples of such an organic solvent are toluene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, methylene chloride, etc. In one emulsion method, a method of converting the whole medicament containing adhesive mass into an emulsion is employed and the emulsion is prepared using a latex emulsion of natural rubber and or synthetic rubber a latex emulsion having a rubber content of about 40 to 80 is suitably used. When using rubber compound adhesive plaster base, tackifying agent, and softener as the base, it is advantageous for the compounding amount of the rubber compound adhesive plaster base to be about 15 to 60 by weight of the total amount of the medicament containing adhesive mass, that of the tackifying agent about 15 to 60 by weight, and that of the softener 5 to 30 by weight. Preferably the total amount of base 3 is 75 to 98.5 , particularly 80 to 97 ,by weight of the total medicament containing adhesive mass. When using acrylic resin as the base, the compounding amount thereof is e.g. 65 to 98.5 , preferably 70 to 97 ,by weight of the total medicament containing adhesive mass. When using the base in the form of emulsion, it is appropriate for the compounding amount of the solid component to be within the above ranges. For production of the medicament containing adhesive mass, the order of adding the medicament 1 , any other medical effect component, the solvent, any additive, and the base may be varied as appropriate, and heating or ultrasonic treatment may be applied for accelerating dissolution in the solvent. The medicament containing adhesive mass thus prepared maybe spread on a support or backing and a release film applied on the adhesive mass layer or the medicament containing adhesive mass may be spread on a release film and a support or a backing applied thereon. When producing the adhesive medicament mass by the above described solvent or emulsion method the further solvent may be evaporated off, or water removed by drying,after spreading the adhesive mass, As the support or backing, a material usually used in the field of this art, such as plastics film, flannel, unwoven fabric, etc., can be used. As the release film, a suitably treated plastics film is usually used. The plaster thus obtained can be fabricated to appropriate form according to the disease and location to be treated, and the various symptoms. For example, for dermatitis neurotica such as insect bite, etc., a patch which is handy to carry and easily applicable is most preferred. The present invention provides for the first time antipruritic plasters containing glycyrrhetinic acids as an essential medicinal component these plasters can exhibit an adequate and durable medical effect without depositing crystals of glycyrrhetinic acid and other medicinal component. Furthermore, the antipruritic plaster of this invention can be advantageous for concentrated treatment of a limited location it need have no unpleasant smell, and does not stain clothes as do ordinary, sticky ointments. When the plaster is in circular patch form, it is very handy to carry and very advantageous for application to insect bites, etc. Tests on antipruritic plasters of this invention and the results thereof are shown below.
