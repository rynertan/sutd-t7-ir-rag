## Description
The present invention relates generally to controllable sweep generators, and more particularly to a sweep generator for generating a sweep signal, the slope or sweep rate of which may be switched in predetermined steps. Sweep or ramp generators are widely used in electronic instrumentation, one example of which is in an oscilloscope, wherein accurate sweep signals are generated in predetermined steps to provide the timebase of a quantitative waveform measurement. Sweep generators for typical oscilloscopes generate timebase sweep signals ranging from ten nanoseconds per screen division to five seconds per screen division in 1 2 5 steps. Shown in Fig. 1 is a conventional sweep generator which comprises a controllable current source including transistor Q₁, a plurality of timing resistors R₁, R₂, ..., R Disadvantages of the conventional sweep generator include the need for many precision timing elements capacitors and resistors including timing resistors in the order of ten kilohms to over ten megohms and difficulty in implementing electronic switches For example, any resistance in series with the timing capacitor would develop an undesirable voltage step when the timing current is supplied thereto. Such a voltage step is not negligible as the timing current becomes larger. In addition, in an article entitled A time interval selector and proportional delay generator by N. L. Roy and D. G. Becker published in The Review of Scientific Instruments, Vol. 42, No. 2, Feb 1971, pages 204 209 a ramp generator and current source is described comprising all the features of the first part of claim 1.

The output voltage V Shown in Fig. 3 is a circuit schematic of the controllable sweep generator. Controllable voltage generator 12 comprises in this particular circuit operational amplifier 21, current source 20 coupled to the inverting input of operational amplifier 21 and resistor 22 connected between the inverting input and the output terminals of operational amplifier 21. It is understood that the output voltage V The output voltage V Integrator section 16 receiving the drain output current timing current I Shown in Fig. 4 is a circuit schematic of another sweep generator. Controllable voltage generator section for generating the voltage V A plurality of current source transistors 41 In operation, operational amplifier 38 amplifies the input signal thereto in such a manner that the entire current V The collector current of the transistor 41 As is understood from the foregoing description, controllable voltage V Fig. 6 shows a simplified block diagram of integrator circuit according to the present invention. This is particularly suited for switching one timing capacitor of a plurality of timing capacitors by electronic switching means. Applied to terminal 50 is a sweep gate pulse to control the generation of termination of the sweep signal. In this particular embodiment, three independent timing capacitors 54 In operation, all of the switches 60, 62, and 64 are set to the upper portion a to select the first timing capacitor 54 This circuit arrangement is particularly useful to avoid any error or voltage step mentioned earlier due to the residual resistance or reactance of the switch connected in series with such timing capacitor. In addition, no stray capacitance of an off switching device is added to the timing capacitor, thereby avoiding any timing error. It should be noted that buffer amplifier 56 is directly coupled across the respective timing capacitor because of the use of independent buffer amplifier and control circuit. As is described hereinafter, optimum buffer circuit may be used as each buffer amplifier 56 The integrator block of Fig. 6 will be better understood by reference to Fig. 7 illustrating a circuit schematic of one practical embodiment. Reset current switch and disconnect diode circuit 52 comprises three emitter coupled transistor pairs Q₆₀ Q₆₁, Q₆₂ Q₆₃ and Q₆₄ Q₆₅ and three diodes D₁, D₂ and D₃. The bases of transistors Q₆₀, Q₆₂ and Q₆₄ are connected in common to control terminal 50 while the bases of transistors Q₆₁, Q₆₃ and Q₆₅ are connected to a suitable bias voltage source V Timing current source 66 is selectively coupled to timing capacitor 54 Buffer amplifiers 56 comprise three FETs Q₇₀, Q₇₁ and Q₇₂, current source FET Q₇₃, resistors R₇₀ and R₇₁ and emitter follower output transistor Q₇₄. The gates of FETs Q₇₀, Q₇₁ and Q₇₂ are coupled to respective timing capacitors 54 In operation, assuming now that first timing capacitor 54 A linear ramp or sweep voltage starts from the aforementioned reference level when the sweep gate voltage at control terminal 50 goes high, thereby turning transistor Q₆₁ off and transistor Q₆₀ on, shifting reset current I Other timing capacitors 54 The use of the independent reset current switch disconnect diode for each timing capacitor and current steering FETs Q₇₅ through Q₇₇ is responsible for deletion of a selector switch in series with the timing capacitor from which the ramp signal is derived. This is very useful in avoiding voltage steps, spikes, etc. which cause non linearity of the ramp signal. Although the buffer amplifiers connected to each timing capacitor are identical in this particular embodiment, different buffer amplifiers may be better suited for each sweep signal, i.e., a faster buffer amplifier for high speed. sweep signal.
