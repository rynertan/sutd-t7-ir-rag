# Polysaccharide production.

## Abstract
A process for producing polysaccharide consisting of a partially acetylated variable block copolymer of D mannuronic and L guluronic acid residues comprises growing a biologically pure culture of a Pseudomonas mendocina microorganism selected from the group consisting of NCIB 11 687, 11 688, and 11 689 in an aqueous nutrient medium by submerged aerobic fermentation of an assimilable carbon source and recovering said polysaccharide. Biologically pure cultures of the said organisms are another feature of the invention.
