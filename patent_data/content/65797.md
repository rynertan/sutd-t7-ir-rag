# Current controlled register for propagating magnetic domains and magnetic domain memory using a plurality of such registers.

## Abstract
A current controlled domain memory comprises a regis ter for propagating magnetic domains in a magnetizable layer. The register comprises a meandering current conductor pattern which can be driven by a bipolar current and the current conductors of which have a width of approximately one domain diameter and a meander period of approximately four domain diameters, which conductor pattern is provided with two control elements per period which generate potential wells in the magnetizable layer of a size of approximately one domain cross section and which are arranged to centre the centres of the domains on the edges of the conductor pattern when the current through the conductor pattern is zero.
