# A process for forming a magnetic record member and a magnetic record member.

## Abstract
A hermetically encapsulated magnetic record member is produced by applying a liquid mixture containing one or more organometallic compounds, an organic solvent and magnetic particles to a thermally stable substrate, e.g. of silicon. The applied mixture is then heated to melt the glass in the organometallic compound so that upon cooling of the glass, the magnetic particles are encapsulated therein.
