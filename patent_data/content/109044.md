The more preferred of these compounds are those having the formula IIaEMI3.3 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof. Also preferred as category i a compounds are those of formula II in which n is 2, especially having a 3 amino 3 carboxypropyl group as the 2 substituent.The preferred compounds having the part structure i b are those represented by formula IIIEMI4.1 in which n is as defined above, and Z is chosen from hydrogen, carboxy, hydroxy, loweralkylthio or amino, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof.More preferred compounds of part structure i b are those of formula IIIEMI4.2 in which n and Z are as defined above.A particularly preferred group of compounds of formulaI i b especially including compounds of formulaeIII and III are those in which n is 1 and Z is lower alkylthio or carboxy.Preferred compounds of category ii are those wherein r p equals 4. Also preferred are those whereinG is hydrogen or methyl. Highly preferred compounds of this category are those in which r p equals 4 and G is hydrogen or methyl.The lower alkyl groups referred to above contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms and include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the corresponding branched chain isomers thereof. The lower alkenyl groups referred to above contain 2 to 6, and preferrably 2 to 4, carbon atoms, and are, for example, vinyl, allyl, but 2 enyl or but 3 enyl groups.The lower alkoxy groups referred to above contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 3, carbon atoms and are illustrated by methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, isopropoxy and the like.The term heteroaryl as used herein refers to a heterocyclic group of aromatic character which contains 5 to 7 ring atoms of which 3 to 6 are carbon atoms and the remaining ring atoms are nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen atoms. Typical heteroaryl groups are those such as pyridyl, for example, pyrid 2 yl, pyrid 3 yl or pyrid4 yl, thienyl, for example, thien 2 yl, or furyl, for example, fur 2 yl.The acyl groups referred to above contain 2 to 18 carbon atoms and are the residue of a sulfonic acid or a carboxylic acid, such as acetyl, propionyl, valeryl and butyryl.The compounds of the present invention possess at least two asymetric carbon atoms or chiral centres, indicated in the partial formula below at the 5 and 6 position carbon atoms. EMI7.1 The configuration at the 5 position is R. The overall configurations at these centers may thus be 5R,6R, and 5R,6S. The preferredconfiguration is 5R, 6S. Additionally there may be an asymetric carbon atom or chiral centre in the hydroxyloweralkyl group R, in which case such centre preferably has the R configuration. As 1 hydroxyethyl is the preferred R group, the preferred configuration at the three centres discussed above will be 5R, 6S, 8R.The compounds of caterogy i a and i b possess at least 3 asymetric carbon atoms, i.e. with one, in addition to those shown above, in the side chain to which the nitrogen atom of group Q is attached. The preferred stereochemistry for this carbon atom in the category i a compounds is R when n is 1 to 4 andS when n is O. However the use of the diastereomeric form at the amino acid carbon is also contemplated and thus the present invention includes both the dia stereomeric mixture at the amino acid carbon as well as the individual diastereoisomer. The stereochemistry of the corresponding carbon atom in the category i b compounds, namely the 1 position carbon atom, is R, as shown in the drawing of the 2 side chain, and the present invention contemplates not only the pure isomer that is the designated isomer in the absence of other isomers of the same compound but mixtures of the designated isomer with other stereoisomers of the same compound.In the category ii compounds, depending upon the particular values for p, r and G, one or more asymetric carbon atoms may exist in the ring substituent attached to the 2 position. The present invention contemplates individual isomers as well as enantiomericand diastereomeric mixtures of these compounds.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts in accordance with the invention include salts formed from organic or inorganic bases, as well as acid addition salts and internal salts i.e. zwitterions.Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, amine and acid addition salts, for example sodium, potassium, aluminium, magnesium and calcium salts, and amine salts which may be formed from a wide variety of suitable organic amines, such as aliphatic, or aliphatic primary, secondary or tertiary mono , dior polyamines, or heterocyclic bases, for example from triethylamine, 2 hydroxyethylamine, di 2 hydroxyethyl amine, tri 2 hydroxyethyl amine, 4aminobenzoic acid 2 diethylaminoethyl ester, 1 ethylpiperidine, bicyclohexylamine, N,N dibenzylethylenediamine, pyridine, collidine, quinoline, procaine, dibenzylamine, 1 ephenamine and N alkylpiperidine.Typical acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphoric and sulfuric or with suitable carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids such as trifluoroacetic, p toluenesulfonic, maleic, acetic, citric, oxalic, succinic, benzoic, tartaric, fumaric, mandelic, ascorbic, lactobionic and malic. The metabolizable esters are the physiologically cleavable esters, i.e., those esters known in the penicillin, cephalosporin and penem arts to be easily cleaved within the body to the parent acid. Examples of such metabolizable esters are those such as indanyl, phthalidyl, methoxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, thienylglycyloxymethyl or acyloxymethyl of the formulaEMI9.1 wherein Y is lower alkyl or phenyl. Particularly preferred metabolirable esters are methoxymethyl, acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl and indanyl.Preparation of these salts and metabolizable esters may be carried out according to conventional procedures for forming salts and esters of beta lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins.Representative examples of compounds of this invention include the following 1 5R,6S,8R,1 R 6 l hydroxyethyl 2 l amino ethyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 2 5R, 6S, 8R l R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 1 amino 3 carboxy propyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 3 5R, 6S, 8R, l R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 1 amino 3 methylthio propyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 4 5R,6S,8R,l R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 t l amino 2 methylthio ethyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 5 5R,6S,8R,1 R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 81 ,5 dianinopentyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 6 sodium 5R, 6S, 8R, l R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 I l acetimidoyl 3 methylthio propyl 2 penem 3 carboxylate or the free acid, 7 sodium 5R,6S,8R,l R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 C 1 guanidoyl 3 methylthio propyl 2 penem 3 carboxylate or the free acid, 8 5R, 6S, 8R, 2 R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 2 amino 2 carboxyethyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 9 5R,6S,8R,4 R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 4 amino 4 carboxy butyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 10 5R, 6S, 8R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 4 piperidinyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 11 SR,6S,8R,3 RS 6 l hydroxyethyl 2 3 piperi dinyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 12 5R,6S,8R,2 RS 6 l hydroxyethyl 2 2 piper idinyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 13 5R,6S,8R,2 R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 2 pyrrol idinyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 14 5R,6S,8R 6 l hydroxyethyl 2 N acetimidoyl 4 piperidinyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, 15 5R, 6S, 8R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 N amidino 4 piperidinyl 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and metabolisable esters of the foregoing free acids.The compounds of this invention possess antibacterial activity which may be determined by testing in standardized in vitro dilution tests for minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs . Using such standard microbiological procedures, the compounds of this invention are found to exhibit activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at test levels of 0.1 to 100 mcg ml. Additionally, they show activity against such organisms in the presence of peni cillinase and cephalosporinase, indicating a resistance to these enzymes. As antibacterial agents, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in conventional manner for oral, parenteral and topical use. Thus the instant invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient therefor. The dosage administered of the penems of this invention is dependent upon 2 variety of factors, i.e., the age and weight of the individual being treated, the mode of administration, and the type and severity of the bacterial infection being prevented or reduced.Typically the dosage administered per day is 1 to 250mg kg and preferably from about 5 to 20 mg kg in divided dosages. Typically, te dosage will be administered in dosage nits ccjntaining convenient amounts, for example, 125, 250 or 500 mg of active ingredient combined with a suitable physiologically acceptable carrier or diluent. For oral administration, the compounds of this invention are typically formulated as tablets, capsules or elixirs. For parenteral administration they may be formulated into solutions or suspensions. Typical topical formulations are lotions, creams, ointments, sprays, and mechanical delivery systems, e.g. transdermal. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for use in the formula tions described above are exemplifed by sugars such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and sorbitol starches such as corn starch, tapioca starch and potato starch cellulose and derivatives such as sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose calcium phosphates such as dicalcium phosphate and tri calcium phosphates sodium sulfate calcium sulfate polyvinyl pyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol stearic acid alkaline earth metal stearates such as magnesium stearate stearic acid, vege table oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil and corn oil non ionic, cationic and anionic surfactants ethylene glycol polymers beta cyclodextrin fatty alcohols hydrolyzed cereal solids, water poly alkylene glycols isopropanol gelatin benzyl alcohol gums and petrolatum as well as other non toxic compa tible fillers, binders, disintegrants and lubricants commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations. Optionally, the compositions may also contain preservatives, aerosol propellants such as hydro carbons and colouring, thicken ing, suspending, dispersing, emulsifying, wetting, stabil izing and buffering agents. In addition, there may also be included in the compositon other active ingredients to extend the spectrum of antibacterial activity and or provide relief of concommittant symptoms such as inflam mation. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by intramolecular cyclisation of a compound of formula IV EMI14.1 in which R10 is oxygen or sulphur, R is as defined above, Pg is a carboxy protecting group, X representsEMI14.2 in which R1 and R2 represent respectively R1 and R2 as defined above except that they cannot simultaneously represent hydrogen or Rj corresponds to R1 as defined above and R2 is an amino protecting group, Pg is a carboxy protecting group and any functional group in Z is protected if necessary or desired orEMI14.3 in which R3 is loweralkyl or an amino protecting group and any functional group in G is protected if necessary or desired, any other functional groups in compound IV are protected if necessary or desired and Y is a phosphonio group being double bonded to the adjacent carbon atom or a phosphonato group with a single bond to the adjacent carbon atom the negative charge of which is compensated.by the presence of a cation, followed by removal of any protecting groups before or after any necessary or desired separation of stereoisomers if a mixture of stereoisomers was subjected to cyclisation, and if necessary or desired subjecting the resulting compound to one or more of the following operations i converting a free acid group to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or metabolisable ester group ii converting a salt to a pharmaceutically acceptable metabolisable ester or free acid iii introducing the groupingEMI15.1 into an amine group represented by Q iv replacing the substituent a when it represents hydrogen,by amidine or the groupingEMI15.2 v separation of admixture of enantiomers. The cyclisation of the intermediate of formula IV is pre ferably accomplished by dissolving the intermediate in a suitable organic solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene and heating at reflux temperature for 24 to 48 hours. The amino group represented by Q or R3 may be converted to corresponding guanidine or amidine group e.g. where an amino group Q is converted to theEMI16.1 group, as described in ICAAC 11th International Congress of Chemotherapy, 19th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Boston, October 1 5, 1979, Papers 231 and 232 and Belgian Patent 848, 545.Salts and esters of the compounds of formula I may be produced by methods well known in the lactam art. For example, salts of such compounds with acid groups can be formed by treating with metal compounds such as alkali metal salts of suitable carboxylic acids, or with ammonia or a suitable organic amine, wherein pre ferably stoichiometric amount or only a small excess of the salt forming agent is used. Acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I with basic groupings are obtainable in the usual manner, for example, by treating with an acid or a suitable anion exchange reagent. The metabolizable esters can be prepared by reacting the corresponding alkali metal salt of formula I with a chloride of the esterifying group, preferably in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. The protecting groups used may be any of those conventionally used in the ss lactam art. Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are those known in the art such as tbutoxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzylloxycarbonyl and 2,2,2 trichloroethoxy carbonyl with the latter preferred. Typical amino protecting groups are those known in the art, such as allyloxycarbonyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2 bromo ethoxycarbonyl , 4 methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and t butoxycarbonyl, with allyloxycarbonyl being most preferred. Typical carboxy protecting groups are allyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2 bromoethyl, 4 methoxybenzyl and t butyl with allyl being preferred.The reaction conditions for any necessary deprotection depends upon the nature of the protecting groups and such conditions are well known to the skilled man.For instance, a 2,2,2 trichloro ethoxycarbonyl group is preferably removed by treatment with zinc and glacial acetic acid at temperatures in the range of from 30 to 0 C groups such as p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl are removed by hydrogenolysis, for example by treating with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium. Allyl and allyloxycarbonyl protecting groups are most preferably removed utilizing the method described in European Patent Application publication No. 13662 which utilizes e.g. 2 ethyl hexanoc acid or an alkali metal salt thereof and as catalyst, an orgnic soluble palladium complex having a coordinating phosphine ligand Alternatively, these protecting groups may be removed by the method of Tsuji described in Tetrahedron Letters, 7, 613 1979 .The Tsuji deprotection procedure utilizes an amine salt of formic acid and a mixture of a palladium compound and triphenylphosphine as the catalyst.Compounds of formula IV can be prepared by following reaction scheme I REACTION SCHEME IEMI18.1 For purposes of illustration the reaction scheme shows the production of intermediates having the preferred 3position substituent namely l protected hydroxyethyl. It will be apparent that the reaction scheme may be applied equally to the preparation of intermediates in which the 3 position substitutent is another protected hydroxy loweralkyl group. The same consideration applies to reaction scheme II below.In step A a 4 acetoxy 3 protected hydroxyethyl azetidin 2 one of formula X in which Pg is a remove able hydroxy protecting group is reacted with a compound of formula XIEMI19.1 in which R10 and X are as defined above, or a reactive derivative thereof,in which any functional groups are protected if necessary or desired. The reaction of step A is generally conducted under basic condition, in aqueous media. In the preferred procedure according to reaction scheme 1 compound XI has the formula XI EMI19.2 in which Xlis as defined above, and the reaction mixture is formed, for example by adding a solution of the azetidinone of formula X in a water miscible solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, to an aqueous solution of the thiolcarboxylic acid of formula XI and sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.Generally the reaction between azetidinone X and thiolcarboxylic acid XI can be carried out at a tempterature in the range of 0 C to 50 C, preferably at room temperature, for 12 to 24 hours.Step B involves a first stage in which a carboxy protected 2 hydroxy acetic acid group is added to the nitrogen of the azetidinone ring in a compound of formulaXII, and a second stage in which the hydroxy group of the 2 hydroxy acetic acid group is replaced by bromine or chlorine.In the first stage the reaction is carried out by reacting the intermediate of formula XII with a glyoxylic ester of formula XIVa or its hemiacetal of formula XIVbEMI20.1 in which Pg is a suitable easily removable protecting group, preferably one which can be removed under the same conditions as other protecting groups in the eventual cyclisation product. For this reason the allyl group is particularly preferred as it may later be removed concurrently with an allyloxycarbonyl group used for amino, group protection. This reaction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride and in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid acceptor such as triethylamine or pyridine. The reaction time may be from 5 to 60 minutes and reaction tempterature from 0 to 50 C, with room temperature being preferred.The second stage of step B may be accomplished utilizing a halogenating agent, for example thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, mesyl chloride, mesyl bromide, or a phosphorus oxyhalide especially the chloride, preferably in the presence of a base, preferably an organic base such as an aliphatic tertiary amine for example triethylamine, pyridine or collidine. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature in the range from 200 C to Oo C. Step C involves the conversion of the halide intermediate of formula XIII into the intermediate of formula IV. This conversion is preferably accomplished by reaction of the halide intermediate with a suitable phosphine such as a triloweralkylphosphine, for example tri n butylphosphine or a triarylphosphine for example triphenylphosphine.Triphenylphosphine is preferred for use in the present invention.The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide. Depending upon the reactiv ity the reaction may be conducted with cooling or at elevated temperatures and is preferably carried out at room temperature.The starting compounds of formula X may be obtained by methods known in the art, for example according to the teachings of European Patent Application PublicationsNo. 3960 and 13662. In a preferred method the compounds of formula X can be obtained by treating a penicillinate of the formula XXEMI23.1 in which pgi is as defined above and A is loweralkyl, with mercuric acetate in glacial acetic acid followed by separation of the resulting azetidinone intermediate of formula XXI EMI23.2 which intermediate is then treated with aqueous acetone and in the presence of potassium permanganate under cooling to give the desired compound of formula X. Intermediates of formula XX are preparable for example following the procedure of preparation C paragraphs A to E in European Patent Application publication No. 0013662, starting from 6 B amino penicillinic acid by 1 first treating the acid in 2.5N sulfuric acid with sodium bromide, then at 0 C with sodium nitrate and bromine to form a mixture of 6,6 dibromo penicillinic acid and 6 ss bromo penicil linic acid, 2 treating the penicillinic acid mixture in dimethyl formamide at 0 C with finely powdered potassium carbonate and methyl iodide, and isolating pure methyl 6,6 dibromopenicillinate, 3 treating the ester from 2 in tetrahydrofuran, under nitrogen with cooling, with acetaldehyde in the presence of methylmagnesiumbromide to yield a mixture of methyl 6a bromo 6ss l hydroxy ethyl penicillinate and the corresponding 6a l hydroxyethyl 6ss bromo compound.4 dehalogenation by treating with a 10 palladium on calcium carbonate catalyst under 2 atmo spheres hydrogen pressure and 5 protection of the l hydroxyethyl group by treatment with ,D,B trichloroethylchloroformate in dry methylene choride in the presence of pyridine and under a nitrogen atmosphere to give the methyl 6 l trichloroethoxycarbonyloxyethyl penicillinate. Compounds of formula XI can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example compounds of formula XI can be prepared by converting the carboxy group of a carboxylic acid of formula XXIIIEMI25.1 in which any functional groups in X are protected if necessary or desired, to a thiolcarboxy group. This can be accomplished by dissolving the compound of formula XXIII in a suitable so vent,for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, treating it with isobutylchloroformate and an organic acid acceptor for example triethylamine or pyridine, followed by the addition of hydrogen sulfide gas.The reaction is preferably carried out at 20 to OOC and for a period fo 5 to 30 minutes.The intermediates of formula XXIII can be produced by first protecting the amino group or groups in the group X of the appropriate carboxylic acid. By way of example, in the preparation of category i a and i b compounds the formula XXIII starting materials can be produced by first protecting the amino group of an alpha amino carboxylic acid, for example of alpha amino carboxylic acid, for example of formula XXIII a and XXIII b EMI26.1 which n and Z are as defined above to afford the corresponding alpha N protected carboxylic acid, for example of formulaLXIV a and XXIV b EMI26.2 in which Pgr is a suitable readily removable amino protecting group, preferably allyloxycarbonyl, Usually the reaction is carried out in aqueous media to which a suitable inorganic base, such as sodium hydroxide has been added. The protecting group can then be added via a reactive derivative, for example the chloroform ate. In the case of the intermediates of formula XXIV and others used in the preparation of compounds of formula 1 i a the carboxylic group attached to the same carbon atom as the amino nitrogen or group Q should also be protected. This can be carried out by reacting the N protected intermediate with allylbromide in the presence of an organic base e.g. triethylamine.It will also be appreciated by the skilled man that functional groups contained in Z, may need to be protected and that such protection can be carried out in conventional manner.Reactive derivatives of the compounds of formula XI include the metal salts e.g. alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts. An alternative method for the preparation of the compounds of formula IV involves the reaction of a suitably protected compound of formula XXIII or of a suitably protected mixed anhydride obtained by reacting a compound of formula XXIII with a suitable chloroformate, for example loweralkyl chloroformate e.g. methylchloroformate or isobutylchloroformate in the presence of an acid acceptor, for example pyridine or triethylamine, with a silver salt of formula XV. The mixed anhydride is preferably prepared in situ in the reaction medium and reacted immediately after its preparation with the silver salt.EMI28.1 in which Pg,Pg and Y are as defined above.This reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent for example tetrahydrofuran or ethyl ether preferably at temperatures of from 200 C to OO C.Reaction times are preferably from 0.5 to 2 hours.The silver salt of formula XV is preferably prepared by following the reaction scheme shown below REACTION SCHEME IIEMI29.1 Step IIA involves the conversion of a compound of formula X into a 4 triphenylmethylthio azetidinone intermediate of the formula XXX in which Pug is as defined above. This conversion is preferably carried out by reacting the compound of formula X with triphenylmethylthiol in the presence of an acid acceptor which may be inorganic, for example potassium or sodium carbonate or organic, for example triethylamine. The reaction is preferably carried out at 0 to 500 C preferably at room temperature and preferably in an organic solvent for example acetonitrile or pyridine.Reaction time depends upon the other reaction conditions utilized but usually is in the range of 2 to 24 hours. Step IIB involves the conversion of the intermediateXXX into the phosphorane intermediate of formula XXXI, which is preferably accomplished using the same or similar procedure as described above for the conversion of the intermediate of formula XII to the intermediate of formula XIV.Step IIC, involves the conversion of the intermediate of formula XXXI to the silver salt XV. This reaction is preferably carried out in a suitable organic solvent for example a halogenated hydrocarbon for example methylene chloride, using a reactive silver compound, usually a salt which is soluble in the selected solvent.Silver nitrate is the preferred reactive silver compound. An organic or inorganic base, for example aniline, pyridine, collidine oran alkali metal carbonate, is preferably included in the reaction mixture. Preferably the temperature range is from 20 C to 250 C. The reaction time depends upon the particular conditions and reagents, but is usually less than 1 2 hour.Another process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I comprises reacting a compound having the general formula IV EMI30.1 in which R,X,R10 and Pg are as defined above any functional groups being protected if necessary or desired with a tri valent organophosphorus compound, preferably triethylphos phite, followed by removal of any protecting groups from the cyclised product before or after any desired separation of stereoisomers if a mixture of stereo isomers was subjected to cyclisation, and if necessary or desired subjecting the resulting compound to one or more of operations i to iv defined above in connection with the first mentioned method of preparation of the compounds of the invention. In essence, this reaction is analogous to that des cribed in our European Patent Application publication No. 58317. In general the reaction can be carried out in an inert solvent for example aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, or toluene, aliphatic ethers e.g. diethylether or di isopropylether, cyclic ethers e.g. dioxane or tetra hydrofuran,and preferably halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylenechloride or chloroform. The cyclisation reaction is preferably carried out in the temperature range 200 C to 800 C and preferably two molar equivalents of the phosphorus reagent is used. The intermediates of formula IV can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula XII EMI32.1 with an acid halide of the general formulaEMI32.2 in which Pg is as defined above and Hal represents halogen e.g. chloro or bromo. The reaction can be carried out in an inert solvent in the presence of an organic base, preferably a tertiary amine and preferably also in the presence of an acid binding agent e.g. an alkaline earth metal carbonate such as calcium carbonate.In addition certain compounds of this invention will form internal salts i.e. zwitterions, which may be obtained by neutralizing salts such as acid addition salts to the isoelectric point.Salts may be converted in the usual manner into the free carboxy compounds. Compounds of formula I can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis or from mixtures of stereoisomers and the resulting mixture of stereoisomers is separated if necessary or desired. The compounds of formula I can thus be prepared according to reaction scheme I and II using racemic starting materials. For instance, in the case of formula I i a compounds these may be prepared starting from racemic starting materials of formula XI which can be prepared using D,L mixtures of the compound shown in stereospecific form in formula XXIII a . A desired isomer of formula I or intermediate therefor can be separated from a mixture of stereoisomers as discussed herein.Resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated into the individual isomers according to known methods.Diastereomeric mixtures, for example, can be separated by fractional crystallization. absorption chromatography column or thin layer or other suitable separation methods.esulting racemates can be resolved into the antipodes in the customary manner, for example, by forming a mixture of diastereomeric salts with optically active salt forming reagents, separating the diastereomeric salts and converting the salts into the free compounds, or by fractional crystallization from optically active solvents.
