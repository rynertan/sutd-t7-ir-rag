# A local area contention network data communication system.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a station for a data trans mission network which is adapted to operate in a cyclic mode for contending for access to the network channel along with other stations of the network. The three states of the cycle are the idle state, the packet being transmitted state and the acknowledgement period state. Each station will not begin transmission until it determines that the chan nel is in an idle state. Once the station has determined that the channel is idle, it will then delay for a period of time that is randomly chosen and, if the channel is still idle, will then begin transmission. In this way, contention conflicts be tween stations is minimized without unduly restricting com munication between stations. Following transmission, the channel will again be quiescent a short period of time before the acknowledgement signal is transmitted from the re ceiver. Each packet of data to be transmitted is of a fixed length so as to provide for synchronization between various stations contending for access to the channel.
