# A method of forming laminated hoses and laminated hoses obtained.

## Abstract
A tubular lining for lining passages is formed, such liner being constructed from a laminate comprising a resin absorbent layer 10 and an impermeable skin 12 . The laminate is wrapped to tubular form with the skin outermost and the free edges are butted together and are connected in this condition by a sewing operation. A sealing ribbon 18 is applied over the sewing to seal the seam and stitching 16 to prevent the flow of liquid or synthetic resin through the seam when the lining is used.
