# High density multilayer printed circuit board.

## Abstract
A high density multilayer printed circuit board compris ing signal layers C , electric source layers B , and ground layers G , with insulating layers arranged between the signal layers and the electric source layers, between the electric source layers and the ground layers, and between the ground layers and the signal layers. Conductor portions 5a. 5b, 5c forming through holes 6a, 6b, 6c are opened in a perpendicular direction to the signal layers, electric source layers, and ground layers. The conductor portions are electrically connected to the signal layers and or the electric source layers, and or the ground layers, through lands 3a, 3b, 3c thereof, the connections of the lands being substan tally equally distributed among the conductor portions.
