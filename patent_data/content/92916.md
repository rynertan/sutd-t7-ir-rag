# Controlled ejection method for injection molding.

## Abstract
A method of controlled ejection of a molded product in relation to orientation, speed of ejection andior sterility is disclosed. The method is not dependent on auxiliary moving parts or vulnerable pins or blades. The molded product is ejected into a guide conduit where the contours of the conduit substantially are regions of the parting surface and the cavity ies. The guide conduit may be fairly holeproof, whereby a very fast ejection may be accomplished when the molded product is transported in an air stream in a manner similar to a pneumatic dispatch, not necessarily in a downward direction. The molded product may be kept sterile while it is transported in a stream of sterile air.
