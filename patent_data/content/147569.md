# Process for the production of hydrogen.

## Abstract
A process for the production of hydrogen with simul taneous formation of carbon dioxide by reacting carbon monoxide with steam at elevated temperatures in the presence of a catalyst which essentially consists of a refractory oxidic carrier having a high specific surface area loaded with metallic copper of a purity of more than 90 by weight, a fraction of at least 1 by weight of said metallic copper calculated as by weight of the total weight of the copper and carrier being present as particles of a size of less than 20 nm.
