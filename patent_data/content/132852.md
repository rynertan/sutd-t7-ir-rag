# Magnetic reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reproducing a signal recorded, in the form of a perpendicular signal magnetization, on a perpen dicular magnetic recording layer 4 backed with a high per meability layer 3 of a magnetic recording medium 1 . A thin film magnetic material 5 is disposed to face the record ing layer so that an enlarged magnetized region is formed in the high permeability layer, which includes the position at which the magnetic material faces the recording layer. In this region, magnetic variation occurs in response to the signal magnetization of the recording layer at the position the magnetic material faces the recording layer. A detecting member 10 such as a coil is disposed in the proximity of the magnetic material so as to be magnetically coupled to the enlarged magnetized region of the high permeability layer. The detecting member is used as a tuning element of a tuning circuit 10, 11 supplied with high frequency energy. An reso nance output voltage of the high frequency circuit varies in response to the detection of magnetic variation in the high permeability layer. A reproducing circuit 14 detects the vari ation in the resonance output voltage of the high frequency circuit to reproduce the signal recorded on the recording layer.
