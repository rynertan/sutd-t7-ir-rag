# Integrated circuit comprising field effect transistors and a programmable read only memory.

## Abstract
Field effect transistors having a short channel length are desirable for carrying out logic operations at a high speed. However, they are then not capable of withstanding the comparatively high programming and erasing voltage at which an E EPROM has to be operated. During the program ming cycle the said field effect transistors are kept in the current non conducting state, whilst recording the logic information obtained by the logic operations, the fast transistors are nevertheless capable of withstanding the said comparatively high voltage.
