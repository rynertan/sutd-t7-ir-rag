# Cable clipping.

## Abstract
A coil of cable is formed by winding a predetermined length of cable 1 on to a spool 2 and fastening to the cable a clip 7 , the clip including first and second recesses 8,9 . Each recess receives a portion of the cable 1 to secure the free end 6 of the cable to the coil 3 . The recesses 8,9 receive a portion of the penultimate turn 10 and final turn 11 respectively. The clip may be applied to the cable as the penultimate or final turns are being wound, or may or alternatively be applied to the coil after the winding of the final turn.
