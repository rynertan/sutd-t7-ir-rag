# A process for producing corrosion inhibiting particles.

## Abstract
A process for producing corrosion inhibiting particles comprising binding corrosion inhibiting anions to particles of an inorganic oxide by ion exchange to form anion exchanged particles, the anions of which are releasible by further ion exchange in which the inorganic oxide particles having surface hydroxyl groups are first contacted with an acidic solution containing labile anions at a pH sufficiency below 7 for the protons of the hydroxyl groups to be replaced by the labile anions and thereafter contacting the particles of the labile anion exchanged inorganic oxide with a solution containing the required corrosion inhibiting anions so that the labile anions are replaced by the corrosion inhibiting anions. The labile anions are anions of water soluble, acid compounds which have a lower affinity for the oxide surface than the required corrosion inhibiting anions and which form a soluble salt with the cation of the compound providing the corrosion inhibiting anions. The process facilitates the use of corrosion inhibiting anions which are sensitive to low pH in the preparation of corrosion inhibiting particles. In particular the process is useful for producing molybdate exchange inorganic oxide particles.
