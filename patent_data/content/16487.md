## Description
METHOD FOR THE PURIFICATION OF BENZAL3EHYDE The invention relates to a method for the purification of benzaldehyde, in particular of benzaldehyde prepared by oxidation of toluene with a gas containing molecular oxygen. Benzaldehyde is an important starting material in chemical synthesis, for instance in the synthesis of flavours and fragrances.For such applications, the benzaldehyde is often required to have a high degree of purity.However, crude benzaldehyde, in particular benzaldehyde prepared by oxidation of toluene with a gas containing molecular oxygen, contains troublesome impurities, which are very difficult to remove. It is pointed out that benzylhydroperoxide normally is not present in significant quantities in the impure benzaldehyde. In particular, it is very difficult to prepare from the crude benzaldehyde a product which meets olfactory specifications. The presence of impurities manifests itself in the rather early discoloration of stored benzaldehyde, occurring even at a very low concentration ppm by wt.level of the impurities. It has been proposed Japanese patent publicationNo. 24.467 74 to purify benzaldehyde by treating it with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. This purification method does not give satisfactory results, however. It appears that the treated benzaldehyde still disolours rather soon. The objective of the invention is to provide a solution to said problem. According to the invention, pure benzaldehyde is obtained by treating impure benzaldehyde, containing no significant quantities of benzylhydroperoxide, with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hytirogenation catalyst for the purpose of hydrogenation of impurities without significant hydrogenation of benzaldehyde and next distilling it. In the treatment according to the invention the loss of benzaldehyde is very small and may be in the order of 1 5 wt. Benzaldehyde meeting olfactory specifications may be obtained even from crude benzaldehyde prepared by oxidation of toluene. Suitable hydrogenation catalysts for the method according to the invention are the known hydrogenation catalyst, for instance those on the basis of metals of group VIII of the periodic system, such as palladium, nickel, platinum, iridium or rhodium. The catalytic material may be on a carrier, for instance carbon, aluminium oxide, silicon or titanium oxide.Particularly suitable catalysts for this method are Raney nickel, and palladium on carbon.The catalysts are preferably used in quantities of 0.5 200 mg at active substance per kg benzaldehyde. Particularly suitable are quantities of 1 100 mg at active substance per kg benzaldehyde. In the method according to the invention, 1 100 litres hydrogen N.T.P. per kg benzaldehyde per hour is normally taken up. Often 3 40 litres hydrogen N.T.P. per kg benzaldehyde is taken up. The contacting of the benzaldehyde with the hydrogen may be effected in various manners. For instance, the benzaldehyde may be stirred in a hydrogen atmosphere for a while or the hydrogen may be bubbled through or passed over the benzaldehyde. The duration of the hydrogenation treatment according to the invention usually is between 0.25 and 4 hours, preferably between 0.5 and 2 hours.The use of larger quantities of catalyst or of large excess of hydrogen, and or extension of the treatment time is are not excluded, but offer s no advantages. Treatment of impure benzaldehyde with hydrogen in the presence of suitable hydrogenation catalyst is preferably effected at a moderate temperature in order to suppress hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. A suitable temperature range is between 270 and 400 K. Particularly suitable are temperatures between 285 and 340 K. The reaction pressure should be such that the liquid phase is maintained. A suitable reaction pressure is, for instance, between 100 and 1000 kPa, in particular between 100 and 500 kPa. The distillation subsequent to the hydrogenation treatment may be carried out at atmospheric or elevated pressure, but preferably at reduced pressure, for instance a pressure of 2 35 kPa. It is pointed out that it is known from the US patent specification No. 3.387.036 that an oxidation product of toluene, consisting of a mixture of toluene, benzylhydroperoxide, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid and some other by products, may be processed in such a manner that the benzylhydroperoxide is converted, for instance by catalytic hydrogenation of this compound. However, such a de peroxidation is completely different from the method according to the invention The invention will be elucidated by means of the following non restrictive examples and comparative experiment. The colour value 0 in degrees Hazen H was determined by ASTM D 1209 62.Example I A sample of benzaldehyde, prepared by oxidation of toluene in the liquid phase by means of a gas containing molecular oxygen with the use of a homogeneous cobalt catalyst, was treated with hydrogen for 2 hours at 295 K and a pressure of 350 kPa in the presence of 0.5 by wt. Raney nickel, during which treatment 10 litres hydrogen N.T.P. per kg benzaldehyde per hour was taken up. Subsequently, the mixture was distilled in a sieve tray column with 30 trays at a top pressure of 20 kPa and with a reflux ratio of 1 3. The colour value 0 of the main fraction was 10 H. This main fraction was divided into two portions. One portion was heated for 1 hour under a nitrogen atmos 0 phere. The colour value rose to 25 H. The other portion was stored for 30 days in a dark bottle under a nitrogen atmosphere.At the end of 0 this period, the colour value had risen to 20 H, Example II A sample of the same liquid crude benzaldehyde as used in example I was treated with hydrogen for 0.5 hour at 305 K and a pressure of 300 kPa in the presence of 0.5 by wt. 5 palladium oncarbon catalyst, during which treatment 30 litres hydrogen N.T.P. per kg benzaldehyde per hour was taken up.Subsequently, the mixture was distilled under the same circumstances 0 as in example I. The colour value of the main fraction was 10 H. This main fraction was divided into two portions. One portion was heated for 1 hour under a nitrogen atmosphere. The colour value rose to 350H. The other portion was stored for 30 days in a dark bottle under a nitrogen atmosphere. At the end of this period, the colour value had risen to 250H.Comparative experiment A sample of the same liquid benzaldehyde as used in example I was distilled without previous treatment, under the same circumstances 0 as in example I. The colour value of the main fraction was 25 H. This main fraction was divided into two portions. One portion was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 0.2 hour, the colour value of this 0 portion had already risen to well over 100 H. The other portion was stored for 30 days in a dark bottle under a nitrogen atmosphere. At the end of this period, the colour value had risen to 500H.
