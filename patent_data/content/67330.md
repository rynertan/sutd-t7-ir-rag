## Description
The present invention relates to a superconducting magnet device of the kind referred to in the precharacterizing portion of patent claim 1. Such a superconducting magnet device is known from the prior art document Proccedings The Third International Conference ou Magnet Technology MT3 , Hamburg 1970, pages 950 et 965. In recent years, as an intermetallic compound superconducting coil for generating a high magnetic flux density of 13 to 15 teslas, there has been used an intermetallic compound superconducting coil which is made of Nb₃Sn and V₃Ga. This superconducting magnet device using the superconducting coil made of an intermetallic compound such as Nb₃Sn or V₃Ga is disclosed, for example, in Swiss Patent No. 514 223 entitled Superconductive Magnets . Specifically, the superconductor as disclosed in column 3, lines 7 to 25 of the Swiss Patent No. 514 223 is produced by soldering a superconductive tape of an intermetallic compound such as Nb₃Sn between two copper tapes. The superconductor thus produced has the defect that it is deformed, if a strong electromagnetic force is applied thereto. Moreover, the superconductor requires a large quantity of copper stabilizer for retaining the stability of the large sized coil. In order to retain a strength sufficient to endure the electromagnetic force, the sectional area of the stabilizer itself has to be enlarged. As a result, the superconducting coil using such intermetallic compound superconductor has its overall current density reduced for the whole coil so that it cannot be applied to a superconducting magnet device of medium or larger size for a high magnetic field requiring a high current density. On the other hand, the superconductor as disclosed in Fig. 2 column 3 line 66 to column 5, line 67 of the U.S. Patent No. 3733692, entitled Method of fabricating a superconducting coil is produced by fabricating a flat strip of electrically conductive tape by roughening a clean surface of the tape, passing it under an arc plasma effluent of metallic particles to establish a direct superconducting coating thereon, and superimposing a layer of insulator. The superconductor thus prepared is sufficient for the strength and the thermal stability but it has difficult workability. Prior art document Proceedings The Third International Conference ou Magnet Technology MT3 , Hamburg 1970, p.950 965, discloses a coil for a superconducting magnet device in which coil intermetallic compound superconducting conductors are wound upon the core of said coil in parallel and in multiple layers together with copper conductors without being metallically bonded to said intermetallic compound superconducting conductors, which thermally stabilize said superconducting conductors. It is the object of the present invention to improve a coil for a superconducting magnet device of the kind referred to in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 in that the coil shall generate a high electromagnetic force, shall be strong and thermally stable, and the strain which is applied to the intermetallic compound superconductor during the winding operation of the superconducting coil shall be reduced as much as possible. In order to achieve the above identified object of the present invention, said copper conductors are made of oxygen free copper which is hardened by a cold working process before the conductors are wound upon said coil core, and said copper conductors are wound superimposed on said intermetallic compound superconducting conductors with a higher winding tension than that being applied to the intermetallic compound superconducting conductors. The specific resistance of the oxygen free copper can be reduced by liquid helium at a temperature of 4.2 K, at which the superconducting coil is used to a low value in spite of the use of the hardened oxygen free copper so that the heat liberation of the oxygen free copper in service can be reduced. Thus, the thermal stability of the superconducting magnet device as a whole can be improved. The specific resistance of the oxygen free copper to be wound together with the intermetallic compound superconducting conductors can be reduced, so that the density of the current to flow through the intermetallic compound superconducting coil can be increased. As a result, it is possible to provide a superconducting magnet device which is suitable for a superconducting coil generating high electromagnetic force. With reference to Fig. 1, a superconductive coil 1 is constructed of superconducting wires 21, which have a rectangular cross section, and oxygen free copper wires 22, which have been hardened, both being wound on a coil bobbin 3. The superconducting wires 21 and the oxygen free copper wires 22 are wound upon the core of the superconducting coil 1 in parallel and in multiple layers. They are not soldered together but merely overlaid. Reference numeral 4 indicates cooling channels allowing liquid helium to pass therethrough. Broken lines 5 indicate the flow of magnetic flux. A not shown insulator is disposed at the boundary between the adjacent superconducting wires. The intermetallic compound superconducting coil according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. When the intermetallic compound superconducting wires made of Nb₃Sn or V₃Ga for generating a strong magnetic field are to be applied to a superconducting coil of medium size, a stabilizing material is required to have a thermal stability and a sufficient reinforcing function. From these points of view, experiments with the cold worked oxygen free copper are carried out in respect to the electric resistance of the oxygen free copper for the cold reduction ratio at a temperature of 4.2 K when in the actual use, at which the intermetallic compound superconducting coil is cooled by liquid helium, and the stress. i.e. the 0.2 yield strength for the plastic deformation of 0.2 , which is considered as one of the measures for the strength of the material. On the basis of the experimental results, the following discoveries are made First of all, if the oxygen free copper was cold worked, as shown in Fig. 2, the experimental results were that the specific resistance Ωcm at 4.2 K, which determines the thermal stability, was saturated under the respective magnetic fields at 0 tesla, 5 teslas and 8 teslas as the cold reduction proceeded. i.e.. as the cold reduction ratio was increased, and that the 0.2 yield strength was increased with the increase in the cold reduction ratio. The oxygen free copper conductors are used in the liquid helium at 4.2 K after they have been wound together with the intermetallic compound superconducting wires. Under such condition, however, the specific resistance of the oxygen free copper is saturated with the increase in the cold reduction ratio so that it is not increased any more. On the other hand, the 0.2 yield strength is increased with the proceeding of the hardening process, as shown in Fig. 2, and is higher at a temperature of 4.2 K than at a temperature of 300 K. Therefore, the oxygen free copper conductors having been cold worked are a suitable material for strength. Thus, the cold worked oxygen free copper wires can be used as both as reinforcing material and as stabilizing material. Secondly, the electric resistance of the stabilizing material can be remarkably reduced without any substantial change in the conductor strength, as is shown in Fig. 3. The softening temperature of the normally conductive metal such as the oxygen free copper is dependent upon the material, purity, cold reduction ratio and so on which makes it difficult to specify a certain value. Here, the softening temperature is defined to be the temperature at which recrystallization takes place and reduction in the mechanical strength begins. It is difficult to bring the mechanical strength to be identical to that at the cold worked state at a temperature lower than the softening point. On the other hand, the change in the electric resistance of the cold worked normally conductive metal due to the heat treatment is shifted down 50 to 200 C from the aforementioned softening point. As a result. a highly efficient intermetallic compound superconductor, with a sufficient performance in respect to the strength and the thermal stability of the intermetallic compound conductor, can be produced by hardening the normally conductive stabilizing material up to a necessary level for the conductor strength and by subjecting the stabilizing material to a heat treatment at a temperature which is 50 to 200 C lower than the softening temperature of the hardened normally conductive metal. Thirdly, the intermetallic compound superconducting coil remains fixed during the magnetizing process of the coil by using either the hardened oxygen free copper wires or the oxygen free copper wires, which have been subjected to the heat treatment after the hardening process. In order to cause the superconducting coil to remain fixed during the magnetizing process. more specifically, it is necessary to firmly wind the wires with a tension stronger than the electromagnetic stress to be applied to the coil. Since such electromagnetic stress exceeds 100 N mm² for the highly magnetic superconducting coil of medium or larger size, the intermetallic compound superconducting wires have to be wound with a tension stronger than 100 N mm². However as it can be seen from the stress strain diagram of the intermetallic compound superconducting wires of Nb₃Sn at a room temperature i.e., 25 C , as indicated by curve B in Fig. 4, for example, if the electromagnetic stress is 100 N mm², only a strain of 0.1 is caused in the oxygen free copper wires of cold reduction ratio of 25 , as indicated by curve A in Fig. 4. on the contrary a strain higher than 0.2 is caused in the superconducting wires of Nb₃Sn so that the performance of the superconducting coil as a whole can be deteriorated above a strain of 0.8 , which shows the value worsening the property of the superconducting wire of Nb₃Sn, as a result of addition of the bending strain during the winding operation. As shown in Fig. 2, however, the cold worked oxygen free copper conductors have a high 0.2 yield strength and exhibit a far higher yield strength at a temperature of 4.2 K than at a temperature of 300 K. Thus, the strength and the temperature stability of the superconducting coil can be improved, by winding the cold worked oxygen free copper wires together with the intermetallic compound superconducting wires. For example, by winding the cold worked oxygen free copper wires with a wiring tension of 150 200 N mm², the intermetallic compound superconducting coil can be firmly wound even if the intermetailic compound superconducting wires are wound with a wiring tension of several times 10N mm². As a result, even if a strong electromagnetic stress is applied, the intermetallic compound superconducting coil can be prevented from any movement so that the superconducting magnet device can be stably operated. Fourthly, by winding the oxygen free copper wires and the intermetallic compound superconducting wires without being metallically bonded to each other, there can be attained the advantage that the oxygen free copper wires and the intermetallic compound superconducting wires can be wound with different winding tensions, and that the bending strain upon the coil winding operation can be reduced as compared with the oxygen free copper wires which are metallically bonded by means of a soft solder to the intermetallic compound superconducting wires. That bending strain is the highest in various strains which are to be applied to the intermetallic compound superconducting coil. By adopting the method thus far described, the total strain can be reduced. Incidentally, the cold reduction of the oxygen free copper wires is preferably within a range of the reduction ratio of 15 to 50 . As shown in Fig. 2, in the case of a reduction ratio equal to or lower than 15 , e.g., in the case of the reduction ratio near 0 , the 0.2 yield strength becomes lower than 100 N mm². As a result, the electromagnetic stress e.g., 100 N mm² of the coil overcomes the 0.2 yield strength. For a reduction ratio exceeding 50 , on the other hand, the oxygen free copper wires are excessively hardened so that their winding operation becomes difficult. Specific embodiments of the present invention. which are constructed in accordance with the discoveries thus far described, will be described in the following together with examples. The embodiments and the examples were compared and examined by producing coils of the same shape with Nb₃Sn superconducting conductors having a width of 4.3 mm and a thickness of 1 mm in case they were wound together with the hardened oxygen free copper conductors and in case only oxygen free copper conductor was used. One embodiment of the present invention will be described in the following with reference to Fig. 1. The coil had an internal diameter of 150 mm, an external diameter of 500 mm and a height of 300 mm. The oxygen free copper conductors 22 having a cold reduction ratio of 25 , a width of 4.3 mm and a thickness of 1 mm were wound in flat layers, while an insulating tape having a thickness of 0.4 mm being applied to their flat surfaces. Insulating spacers having a thickness of 2 mm were inserted between adjacent turns of the coil 1 to provide the cooling channels 4. The coil thus produced was firmly wound by applying a tension of 100 N mm² to the oxygen free copper conductors 22 and a tension of 50N mm² to the Nb₃Sn superconducting wires 21. Another coil without oxygen free copper conductors was produced by winding the Nb₃Sn superconducting conductors having the same size as the aforementioned ones with a tension of 50N mm², and insulating spacers having a thickness of 2 mm were inserted between adjacent turns of the coil to provide the cooling channels. Both coils were dipped in liquid helium at a temperature of 4.2 K and were subjected to separate magnetizing tests. As a result, the intermetallic compound superconducting coil wound with the oxygen free copper conductors could exhibit the characteristics of the intermetallic compound superconducting wires at a first magnetization, i.e., generate such a magnetic field of 10 teslas which substantially coincides with a critical current. The mean current density of the coil as a whole at this time was 66.1 A mm² and independent of the number of magnetizing times, as indicated by letter D in Fig. 5. The circled numerals appearing in Fig. 5 indicate the number of the magnetizations . Letter E in Fig. 5 shows the case in which the coil was produced by winding the oxygen free copper conductors 22 having been subjected to a heat treatment for one hour at 250 C after the cold reduction of 25 and the Nb₃Sn superconducting conductors 21 while applying a tension of 15N mm² to the former and a tension of 50N mm² to the latter. In this case upon an initial magnetization and a generation of a magnetic field of 10 teslas the coil exhibited characteristics which were coincident with the characteristics of the intermetallic compound superconducting conductors. The mean current density of the coil at this time was 72 A mm² and independent of the number of the magnetizations. Next, the results of the tests of another intermetallic compound superconducting coil which was wound without the oxygen free copper conductors have revealed that the coil was quenched at 5.8 teslas by the magnetization of the first time so that it could not generate a central magnetic field higher than 7.3 teslas although the performance was improved to some extent thanks to the training effect after the magnetizations were repeated five times. The mean current density of the coil at that time was 48.3 A mm². This is deduced to come from the fact that the intermetallic compound superconducting coil using no hardened oxygen free copper conductors has their performances degraded by the strain during the repetitions of the experiments as a result that its intermetallic compound superconducting wires were moved by the magnetic stress of about 100N mm². In the so far described embodiment Nb₃Sb superconducting conductors were used, but the influence of the strain is similar for the V₃Ga or other intermetallic compound superconducting conductors, and similar advantageous features can be expected by applying the present invention. Moreover, it is apparent that the present invention itself can be applied even if the shape of the intermetallic compound superconducting conductors or the construction of the coil is changed. In general, a superconductive magnet coil is liable to be deteriorated for a strain. But according to the present invention, since the relatively small strain is applied to the superconducting magnet coil previously, the superconducting magnet coil thereof does not show a deteriorated performance, even if a large magnetic stress is applied thereon. Especially this effect is the more prominent for the larger size and the higher magnetic field of the intermetallic compound superconducting coil. On the other hand, the superconducting coil of medium size is required to have an especially high current density. The mean current density of the intermetallic compound superconducting coil of the present invention can be enhanced more than 40 to 70 compared with that of the prior art. The performance is not deteriorated by strain, because of the following advantageous effects 1. The superconducting conductors are not moved by the electromagnetic force and 2. The oxygen free copper conductors having an excellent thermal conductivity are wound together with the intermetallic compound superconducting conductors.
