# Lithographic resist and device processing utilizing same.

## Abstract
Copolymers of poly alpha substituted acrylonitrile, e.g., methylacrylonitrile, manifest film forming properties, adhe sion to usual substrates, sensitivity to actinic radiation, resolution, contrast, and other properties of significance for fine line lithographic use. Contemplated use includes fabrication of masks for manufacture of large scale integrat ed circuits. Stability to attack by ions and reactive chemicals, as well as thermal stability, are sufficient to permit use in direct processing of such circuits. Integrity of pattern fea tures may be further assured by post development treat ment. Heating results in rearrangement to render the pat terned resist more stable under a variety dry processing conditions.
