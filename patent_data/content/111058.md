# Process for producing 4 demethyl epipodophyllotoxin beta D ethylidene glucoside and acyl derivative thereof.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are a process for producing 4 demethyl epipodophyllotoxin β D ethylidene glucoside of the formula II comprising A reacting 4 halogenoacetyl 4 demethyl epipodophyllotoxin β D 2,3 di O halogenacetyl 4,6 O ethylidene glucoside of the formula I with an amine and or ammonia, or B subjecting the acyl derivative I to alcoholysis in the presence of a catalyst, thereby removing the halogenoacetyl groups of the acyl derivative I to obtain the compound II , the acyl derivative I , and the use of the acyl derivative I for synthesizing the compound II
