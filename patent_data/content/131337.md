# Double balanced mixer circuit.

## Abstract
Two cross coupled differential amplifiers T₁, T₂ and T₃, T₄ have a common first 1 and a common second 2 base terminal to which an oscillator signal is applied. Via trans former 12 the radio frequency signal from a source 10 having an impedance 11 is applied to a balanced common base circuit comprising the transistors T₅, T₆ , whose collec tors are coupled to the common emitter terminals 3 and 4 of the differential amplifiers T₁, T₂ T₃, T₄ respectively. With such a mixer circuit a better intermodulation and noise behaviour is obtained when compared with the usual diffe rential amplifier instead of the balanced common base circuit.
