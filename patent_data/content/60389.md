# Sheet separator device for separating sheets from a stack.

## Abstract
A sheet stack separator comprises a rotary wave generator which contacts the top sheet of a stack to swivel that sheet and adjacent sheets from the stack. The rotary wave generator comprises arms 34 carrying freely rotatable rollers 50, 52 and is movable normal to the stack between operable and inoperable positions. A pin 100 , positioned at the centre of the generator, is loaded by a spring 98 . When the generator is in its operative position the pin effects pressure contact on the top sheet to define the point about which the sheet swivels. A control system is operable to effect step increases of the force applied by the generator and or the velocity of the generator as the sheets are swivelled.
