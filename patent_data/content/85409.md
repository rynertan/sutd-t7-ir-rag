## Description
CONTINUOUS COMBUSTION SPARK PLUG The invention relates generally to internal combustion engines, and, more particularly, to spark pugs for use in internal combustion engines. In conventional internal combustion engines, unburned gas remains in the combustion chambers while the engine is in operation. Engine operation is affected because the gas remaining in the cylinders while the engine is in operation decreases the average effective charging efficiency of the engine and increases the temperature of combustion.Moreover, the residual gas causes a buildup of precipitates, such as carbon, tar, and the like, on the electrodes of the spark plug of each combustion chamber and hinders complete combustion of newly added mixture gas. In order to improve the engine operation, it would be advantageous to effectively remove the incompletely combusted residual gas from the cylinders while the engine is in operation. It is well known that the pressure in the combustion chambers temporarily and cyclicly becomes smaller than atmospheric pressure during the combustion stroke and the exhaust stroke of each cylinder of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, the residual gas can be replaced by new gas during the exhaust stroke. By eliminating the elimination the residual gas and introducing new gas, it is possible to reduce the buildup of carbon or tar across or on the electrodes of the spark plugs. With regard to this latter problem, an improved spark plug is disclosed in the Republic of South Africa patentNo. 59 3680 to Coenraad Christoffel Groenewald, which was granted on December 7, 1960. Groenewald discloses a spark plug which includes a positive center electrode having a small diameter air passageway extending through it. A ball type check valve is provided at the upper end of the air passageway. Groenewald discloses that the spark plug, when used in an internal combustion engine, produces a blast of air into the combustion chamber during the combustion stroke of the engine. The blast of air assists in removing the precipitates which build up on or between the electrodes of the spark plug. The check valve prevents the gas mixture from escaping from the combustion chamber when the pressure in the combustion chamber exceeds atmospheric pressure. Internal combustion engines, however, have cylinders of various diameters. Therefore, air must be introduced in amounts corresponding to the volume of the cylinders.When the spark plug disclosed in the Groenewald patent is used in internal combustion engines having cylinders with different volumes, only limited effectiveness may be expected. The present invention solves this latter problem by providing a spark plug for use in internal combustion engines having cylinders of any volume. Furthermore, the spark plug of the present invention enables continuous ignition in the combustion chamber hiring the removal of unburned residual gas, thereby reducing the harmful effects of the residual gas on the electrodes of the spark plug. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a spark plug for use in an internal combustion engine having at least one combustion chamber. The spark plug includes a positive or first center electrode having an air passageway extending through it and a check valve box disposed at one end of the positive or first electrode to prevent gas in the combustion chamber from escaping through the air passageway. The check valve box includes at least one air introduction port for introducing and limiting air flow into the air passageway. The positive or first electrode and the check valve box are disposed within an insulator for electrically insulating the positive or first electrode from a negative or second electrode extending from a metal fitting affixed to the end of the insulator opposite the check valve box. In one aspect of the present invention, an adjusting valve is provided in the check valve box in between the air introduction port and the air passageway of the positive electrode for controlling and varying the air flow into the combustion chamber of the engine. In another aspect of the present invention, an air filter assembly is provided around the introduction port of the check valve box to clean the air which is introduced into the combustion chamber. In still another aspect of the present invention, rotor means is provided for cooperating with an ignition current supply source via an electrical wire to enable continuous ignition in the combustion chamber during the removal therefrom of unburned gas. The rotor means is rotatably disposed around the portion of the insulator surrounding the check valve box.
