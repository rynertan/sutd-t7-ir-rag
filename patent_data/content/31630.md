## Description
A PROCESS F, PREPARIN A PROTEIN FCRTIFIED CURED MEAT r l D PROTEIN ORTIFIED CURED MEAT OBTAINED WITH SAID PRoC SS. The present invention relates to protein fortification of cured meat. Meat such as pork is presently cured with brine solutions which contain molecularly dehydrated polyphosphates having a Na2O P205 ratio of 0.9 1 to 2.0 1 such as sodium tripolyphosphate to improve structure, color and juice retention especially when heated Hall, 2,513,094 . This treatment improves the physical characteristics of the meat but not the nutrition of the meat. It is known to incorporate amino acids into cure solutions to overcome taste and flavor problems see U.S. Patent No. 3,552,978 . The amount of amino acids utilized is limited by the off flavor that excessive amounts of amino acids can contribute to the system. While ground or minced meat has been fortified with protein from various animal or vegetable sources, attempts at protein fortification of cured skeletal meat are few. In May of 1976, the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture issued an interim regulation since rescinded allowing for the use of non meat proteins such as isolated soy protein, wheat protein concentrate, yeast, NFDM and dried whey in meat products provided that certain vitamin and mineral requirements are satisfied and that the finished product contains a minimum protein content of 17 and a maximum moisture to protein ratio of 4 1.Isolated soy protein has generally been suggested for such use but widespread acceptance of the system has not occurred. In past attempts to extend the protein content of cured meat with soy protein, it was found that soy protein isolate could only be used to provide s improvement in protein content for hams pump 3nly up to 121 green weight. Only stitch pumping could be used since the solutions clogged the needles preventing artery and vein pumping. CentralInstitute for Nutrition and Food Research in Brussels,Belgium, August 1966, Report R.2239 . Hawley et al., 3,989,851, disclosed that these difficulties could be overcome by the use of a curing medium prepared by hydrating a non fibrous protein isolate substantially free of carbohydrates such as soy isolate, and then admixing the curing salts with the hydrated protein. The process of Hawley et al. has not been commercialized to any great extent. Since the soy isolate must be fully hydrated using nearly all of the water designated for the curing medium RalstonPurina Brochure for SUPRO commat 640 T, FortiblendTM dry cure ingredients must be used preventing the use of phosphate solutions or brine solutions. Special equipment is required to properly prepare the curing solution. The brine cannot be artery pumped since the colloidal particles of protein in suspension are larger than the inside of the capillaries. Artery pumping of the solution can cause capillaries to burst resulting in low yields and under cured areas of the meat due to insufficient cure distribution.Because of the high viscosity of the curing solution caused by the protein, a tendency toward pocketing of the solution in the seam and seam fat areas of a ham has been reported ibid, Ralston Purina . Since this results in an undesirable appearance, it has been recommended to bone and defat the ham ibid, RalstonPurina . The hams must be massaged or tumbled to insure distribution and equalization of the curing medium throughout the ham. When the water to protein ratio falls below 8 1 at above 145 pump , dry protein must be added to the massager in order to meet the 17 minimum protein and the moisture to protein ratio of 4 1 requirements as set by theUnited States Department of Agriculture. Even using the process of Hawley et al., hams pumped to 140 green weight show definite yellow tinges or spots of yellow throughout the muscle meat.Soy protein coagulates as yellowish brown, grainy patches in the fat and on the exterior surface of the hams. The hams also take on a characteristic beany taste. Since the price of cured meat has increased significantly and since the quantities per consumer are less, the extension of the meat with a lower cost protein of high nutritional value is finding economic impetus. However, such products will not become commercially feasible unless the fortification at equal to or greater than the protein content of the original meat can be accomplished while providing a product of good color, texture, appearance and taste.THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, protein fortified cured meat characterized by good flavor, color, appearance and texture is provided by contacting the meat with a curing composition and a whey protein concentrate based protein extender.Optionally, the cure can contain cure accelerators such as erythorbic acid, ascorbic acid or their salts, a protein modified such as an alkali metal polyphosphate, flavor enhancers and if desire a small amount of another protein containing composition. The protein used in the present invention can be hydrated any time prior to use and can be artery pumped up to 135 and stitched pumped above 150 green weight. The extended cured meat does not exhibit undesirable coloring or unsightly protein coagulation within or on the meat. Good flavor, color and texture of the product are achieved. The characteristic beany taste of soy is not present.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION As used herein, the term cured is intended to include the application of brine or other curing compositions in liquid form to the interior and or the exterior of the meat. The term cured is also intended to cover dry cured products to the extent that the meat is injected with a protein solution before or after curing or to the extent that the whey protein material can be taken up from a dry cure. As used herein, the term cured meat is intended to include the non comminu ted red meats such as beef, pork, veal, lamb or mutton, wild meats such as venison as well as intact poultry such as chicken, turkey, geese, capon, Cornish hens, squab, duck, guinea fowl and pheasants, which are cured by chemical means such as salt NaCl or sodium nitrite. The protein extender for use in the present invention comprises 75 100 of a whey protein concentrate and from 25 0 of another protein containing source. The protein must be hydratable so that it can be injected or absorbed into the meat. The whey protein concentrate is required to have a minimum of about 30 protein with the remainder of the composition being lactose and ash. The optional protein source can be either animal or vegetable and can be derived from dairy sources such as milk or whey or vegetable sources such as soy. When using soy protein as the optional protein source, care must be taken to insure that the soy protein is properly hydrated if necessary prior to dissolution of the salt and phosphates in the curing medium.Limited amounts of soy protein should be used to avoid a beany taste. The whey protein concentrate used in the present invention can be derived from either acid cottage cheese whey or sweet cheddar cheese whey as desired.Acid whey is the byproduct obtained from the acid coagulation about pH 4.6 of milk protein casein by the use of a lactic acid producing bacteria e.g., lactobacillus or by the addition of food grade acids such as lactic or hydrochloric acid, i.e., by direct acidification. Sweet whey is derived from the product of cheddar cheese which is commonly produced by the rennet coagulation of casein. Whey from the manufacture of other cheeses can also be used. The whey protein concentrate as used in the present invention is most preferably derived from 100 acid cheese whey though minor amounts of other cheese wheys of up to 50 and preferably less than 20 can be used in the preferred form. The whey protein concentrate must be hydratable under the conditions of the curing solution. Processes which can be utilized to prepare whey protein concentrate in a hydratable form include Electrodialysis Stribley, R.C., Food Processing. Volume 24, No. 1, p. 49, 1963 Reverse Osmosis, Marshall, . et al.,Fractionation and Concentration of Whey by ReverseOsmosis, Food Technology 22 a 696, 1968 GelFiltration U.S. Reissue Patent No. 27,806 orUltrafiltration, Horton, B.S. et al., FoodTechnology, Volume 26, p. 30, 1972. Chemical methods such as phosphate precipitation as described inGordon Patent No. 2,388,624 and Melachouris PatentNo. 4,043,990 can be used if the products obtained from those chemical precipitation methods are hydratable under the conditions of the curing medium. It has been found that the most effective results have been obtained using an ultrafiltered acid cottage cheese whey protein concentrate containing at least about 40 whey protein. In a typical process, cottage cheese whey is neutralized to a pH of about 6.4 with 50 caustic. The pH is subsequently adjusted to about 7.2 and any solids or precipitates are removed by centrifugal clarification. The clarified liquor is then pasteurized. The liquor is then fed into an ultrafiltration membrane unit. The retentate is condensed and spray dried. Protein products of 35 or more whey protein can be prepared by this process. One of the more preferred products prepared by the process generally comprises from about 40 to about 60 protein based on total Kjeldahl nitrogen, 10 30 lactose, 3 15 ash and 0.1 4 fat.It is preferred to use a product in the dry form to avoid the need for refrigeration though the liquid whey protein concentrate can also be used. As used herein, the term whey protein concentrate is also intended to include any of the products prepared by other methods which have a whey protein concentration of at least 30 and the composition is hydratable under the conditions of the curing medium. It is pointed out that all of the ingredients in the whey protein concentrate are required to be hydratable under the conditions of the curing medium.This requires that the protein not be denatured or that the lactose, salts or any other material in the composition not cause any dissolution problems. In audition to the whey protein concentrate, the curing medium can also include from about 25 to about 0 of another protein containing composition preferably based on dairy products such asNFDM, dried whey, delactosed whey, delactosed demineralized whey where demineralization is accomplished by any known method such as electrodialysis. The whey protein concentrate can. be dissolved in water and have the remainder of the curing ingredients added or the whey protein concentrate can be added to the phosphate solution or brine.The whey protein concentrate is easily hydratable in either instance. The curing solution can contain just the protein or protein and additional curing compositions such as curing salts, i.e., sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, and sodium nitrite protein modifiers, i.e., monosodium phosphate, disodium phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and the like as well as sodium hydroxide phosphate blends i.e., four parts phosphate per part sodium hydroxide and their potassium homologues cure accelerators, i.e., ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, their sodium and potassium salts, and mixtures as well as blends thereof with up to 508 citric acid or sodium citrate flavoring ingredients, i.e., sugar, dextrose, brown sugar, spices, spice extracts, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, and artificial or liquid smoke flavor enhancers, i.e., monosodium glutamate, hydrolyzed vegetable protein proteolytic enzymes for softening beef tissue and carbonates and bicarbonates of alkali metals such as sodium in an amount sufficient to stabilize sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite solution to pH 5.6 at pickle temperature of about 50C. The amount and type of curing materials will depend on the type of meat cured and the cure normally used by that manufacturer.While these blends vary from meat processor to meat processor, a typical curing formulation will contain from about 0.5 to 16 and preferably from about 7 to about 14 protein, from about 3 to about 20 and preferably from about 4 to about 7 NaCl, from about 1.5 to about 20 and preferably from about 2 to about 4 sugar, from about 0.4 to about0.15 and preferably from about 0.04 to about 0.07 sodium nitrite, from about 0 to about 0.2 sodium nitrate, from about 0.1 to about 0.5 and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.2 sodium erythorbate, and from about 0.7 to about 5.08 and preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.5 molecularly dehydrated phosphate such as sodium tripolyphosphate.Preferably, the cure contains from about 9 to about 12.5 protein. These percentages are by weight based on the total weight of the curing medium. Other curing compositioas are in the realm of one skilled in the art. The curing solutions for use in the present invention can be prepared by hydrating the protein first or by adding the protein to a phosphate and or brine solution. No articular blending problem has been encountered. Good manufacturing technique is used to insure that the materials are thoroughly admixed to provide a uniform cure. The meats which can be protein fortified in accordance with the invention include pork derived meats such as hams, pork shoulders, picnics, loins, butts, and bacon beef derived meats such as round or brisket peppered beef round, pastrami, tongue, corned beef, brisket or round and beef bacon and similar cuts derived from lamb, veal and venison. The meat can be sold in large pieces such as a whole ham, or small pieces such as corned beef, in whole or sliced form, or in any form particular to that meat such as whole hams, boned hams, oval hams, pear shaped hams, canned, boiled, smoked or dried. The solid meat can also be a formed product known as sectioned and formed. Sectioned and formed is intended to be limited to large intact meat products prepared from smaller, intact pieces and is not intended to cover comminuted meat. The meat can be boned if desired though this is not essential. The cured poultry meat preferably from chicken or turkey which can be fortified in accordance with the present invention can be in the form of whole poultry or poultry parts. Poultry parts include whole breast, fillets, sectioned and formed, rolled, and the like. The protein fortification can be applied to poultry destined for any normal cured poultry. The cost of the whey protein versus the cost of the cured poultry will generally dictate the area of use. The protein fortified curing solution can be applied to the meat using any known means for that purpose such as artery pumping, injection or stitch plumping, osmosis curing with or without pumping or dry curing and combinations thereof.The proper technique utilized will be governed by the meat and the process used by the meat processor. Preferably, the pumped meat is massaged or tumbled after pumping to insure even distribution of the cure. Cure solution, whey protein solution or purge from the pumped meat can be present during massaging to allow additional cure solution to be absorbed during massaging. The meat is preferably trimmed of surface fat to assist in reabsorbing of fluid during massaging. Massaging is preferably carried out for a period of time ranging from about two hours to about eight hours though the massaging can be carried out for longer periods without disadvantageous effects. It is also within the scope of the invention to pump the meat with the protein and then separately or simultaneously with the cure or vice versa.These procedures can be accomplished at any time prior to smoking or cooking. No limits are known for the amount of protein fortified cure that can be pumped. Cure solutions containing 14 protein can be pumped as high as 160 of green weight. The preferable limits to the amount of protein added are the governmental limits which for meat are at least 17 protein and a moisture to protein ratio of 4 to 1. It is preferred that the final product contain at least 1 supplemental protein on a dry basis as added by the fortifier, the percentage being based on the final weight of the fortified and massaged product. A protein fortified meat composition can contain, for example, from about 60 to about 80 natural intact muscle, from about 20 to about 40 curing composition and from about 2 to about 15 on a dry basis of a whey protein fortifier composition containing from about 75 to about 100 whey protein concentrate and from about 25 to 0 of another protein. The meat products can then be processed by standard industry techniques including those necessary to meet governmental regulations. Pork must be held at a temperature not above 4.50C. for 30 days to be certified free of trichinosis or cooked to an internal temperature of at least 56.10C. Por is usually smoked at above these temperatures for the final product. Beef such as corned beef is sold refrigerated and uncooked. It is also considered with the scope of the invention to inject a whey protein concentrate extender into cured meat which is already cooked smoked . While cooking to a high enough temperature will coagulate the whey protein, it is not required that the whey protein form an irreversible gel upon heating. Therefore, unheated whey protein solutions may be injected into cooked meat as an extender for a ready to eat product. The results obtained for cooked and uncooked would be similar. The product of the present invention is a protein fortified cured meat characterized by good flavor, color, texture and taste. It is not essential to add the protein to the curing solution in any set order nor is it necessary that the protein form an irreversible gel. Equivalent results are obtained from cooked and uncooked meats as well as from boned or unboned meats. The invention is further illustrated in the examples which follow.

The tasters consistently agreed that the hams containing the whey protein concentrate had better flavor, color and appearance as compared to the hams pumped with a soy protein containing pickle. The whey protein containing hams had better texture than the control hams. Whey protein concentrate can be hydrated at any stage of the pickle preparation. Whey protein concentrate does not have to be dissolved first as required for the incorporation of soy protein into the pickle. Pickles containing whey protein concentrate are less viscous and pumping is facilitated. These pickles can be artery pumped whereas pickles containing soy protein cannot. Since good cook yield is related to retained pump, it is preferred that the whey protein concentrate containing pickle be pumped to a high level and that the pumped meaX receive vigorous tumbling or massage to obtain high cook yields.
