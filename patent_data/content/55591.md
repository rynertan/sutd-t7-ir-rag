## Description
JEMCY CONICAL RECEIVING ANTENNA The present invention relates to a high gain wide bana antenna. In particular, the invention is airectea to an antenna for receiving television signals in the VHF Very High Frequency and UHF Ultra High Frequency frequency ranges, although it is not limited thereto. At the present time, most television stations broadcast in the VHF frequency band. However, there is an increasing number of television stations now broadcasting in the UHF band. Accoruingly, many of the television receivers being produced at this time are aaapted to receive both VHF ana UHF transmissions. Many VHF UHF antennas, such as the rabbit ears indoor antenna, are not ideally suited for receiving VHF UHF transmissions owing to high rise buildings blocking line of sight and causing reflections ghosts ana it is Åaesireu therefore to install antennas for the reception of both VHF and UHF TV channels having high gain, narrow beam wiath ana wise oana response. Most outdoor TV antennas are of the Yagi or Yagi Uda type. The Yagi or Yagi Uda antennas are generally fixed frequency narrow band antennas, i.e. they exhiDit hign gain only over a single frequency band. This frequency band is designed to cover the particular broadcast frequency which is to be received. However, due to the allocated frequency spacing of TV channels, particular TV channels will lie outsiae the resonance curve of any one Yagi dimension and consequently, the antenna exhibits low gain at the frequencies of these TV channels. This results in poor reception at these channels. In built up areas and in rugged terrain, many objects act as screens ana or passive repeators, changing wave patterns, phase and general characteristics of the radiated television signals. Since the receiving antenna cannot change the intervening space between the transmitter and tne receiver, every effort must se made in the receiving antenna to restrict reception to a narrow beam line of sight and to obtain the maximum gain of the signal required, rejecting unwanted reflection images. The antenna of the present invention provides a very narrow beam in the horizontal and vertical planes, thereby giving very high rejection of radiation outside the beam width causea, for example, by re radiation from intervening objects, and eliminating ghosting to a large degree. Antennas of conical shape are known, although these are not generally used for TV reception. The conical antenna is one of a large number of special antennas which have Deen developed to operate satisfactorily over a wide frequency band. Australian Patent No. 119,117 discloses a bi conical aouble disc antenna adapted for orientation in the vertical plane. Australian Patent No. 107,639 discloses a biconical antenna which also utilises the wide band effect by using an hour glass11 antenna in the vertical plane. The vertical antennas act as isotropic sources of radiation in the horizontal plane. These antennas have not found widespread use for the reception of vertically polariseci television signal transmissions. The Yagi Uda antenna is generally orientated horizontally and therefore is suitea to reception of horizontally poiarised television signals. Any bipolar array may be mounted in the horizontal plane or the vertical plane or even in certain difficult situations may be used in diversity one on the vertical plane separated by 5 A from the other on the horizontal plane. The Yagi Uda antenna usually comprises a half wave dipole with reflector and director rods orientated parallel thereto ana spaced therefrom by predetermined distances. By using undriven reflector rods, gains of about 3 db can be realised with these antennas. However, the impedance of these antennas will be 72 ohms for a single radiator and 300 ohms ror a folded dipole.A parasitic element may be behind the driven element in relation to the desired direction of maximum gain, in whicn case it is called a reflector, or it may be in front of the driven element, in which case it is called a director. Reflectors and airectors may both be used to obtain even more gain. This is the principle which forms the basis of the Yagi or Yagi Uda antenna. Increased gain can be achieved by adding further parasitic elements suitably spacea parallel to the dipole, usually as directors. However, it has been found that any increase beyond 11 elements does not appreciasly affect the gain.The maximum gain for an 11 element Yagi antenna is of the order of 10dub theoretical . A multi element Yagi antenna becomes very heavy and very cumbersome when used in the VHF Dank. Another antenna, the corner reflector antenna has been found to be as efficient as, or more efficient than, the multi element Yagi antenna. The corner reflector antenna comprises a half wave dipole placed parallel to the intersection or two conducting planes which provide considerable directivity if the angle between the planes and the position of the dipole are chosen correctly. Gains of up to 12db can be achieved but in practice the actual gain obtained from a corner reflector antenna is usually of the order of 9.4dub to 10.3db. One of the main disadvantages of the corner reflector antenna is that it has a critical narrow band resonant frequency, and it cannot be classed as a broad band antenna. In radar applications, considerable use has been made of the mirror effect of radio waves to concentrate transmissions in very narrow beams by a means of reflectors constructed on the principles of search light reflectors. In general, the dimensions necessary for high efficiency in such systems are of the of order of several wavelengths and at very high frequencies this does not present a problem.However, little use has been made of this principle in VHF and UHF bands, due principally to the larger wavelengths involved. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above described disadvantages by providing an antenna for receiving television broadcasts, said antenna having a relatively high gain over a wide frequency bandwidth. According to the present invention, there is disclosea an antenna for receiving or transmitting electromagnetic radiation, said antenna comprising an elongate support member said support member having thereon a biconical radiator receiver means for transmitting or receiving said radiation, and b reflector means spaced a predetermined distance from said biconical means, said reflector means comprising a parabolic reflector having its focal point substantially at the location of said biconical means. Preferably, the antenna also comprises two pairs or director rods mounted on the support member and spaced a pre aeterminea distance from each other and from the biconical means, the director rods being mounted on that sicie of the biconical means remote from the reflector means, ana orientated parallel to the biconical means.Notwithstanding any other forms that fall within its scope, one preferred form of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the drawings, in Ihich Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an antenna according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is plan view of the antenna of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of the antenna ofFig. 1 Fig. 4 is an end elevational view of the antenna ofFig. 1. looking into the reflector Fig. 5 is an explode plan view of the antenna ofFig. 1 Fig. 6 is a partially exploded plan view of the bi conical radiator of the antenna of Fig. 1 and Fig. 7 is a plan view of a director of the antenna of Fig. 1. Fig 8 is a frequency response curve for the preferred embodiment. Turning to Fig. 1, the preferred embodiment comprises an elongated support member which is preferably a rod 1, upon which other components of the antenna are mounted. Typically, the rod 1 is a hollow PVC rod but any other suitable material will suffice providing that if metal is used the radiator must be insulated from it. Bi conical radiator receiver means such as the biconical radiator 2 are mounted on the rod 1 as shown in Figs 1 to 4. Although the biconical means are referred to as a biconiÇ radiaAtor , it is to be understood tnat the radiator can be used for receiving or transmitting electromagnetic radiation At one end of the rod 1 there is mounted reflector means such as the parabolic reflecting dish 3 shown in Fig.1. Two pairs of director rods 4 and 5 are mounted on the rod 1 on the side of radiator 2 remote from reflector 3.The director rods 4 and 5, the radiator 2 and the longitudinal axis of reflector 3 are aligned as shown inFigs. 2 to 4. The antenna shown in Fig. 1 uses the combination of the biconical radiator 2, the director roas 4,5, and the reflector 3 whicn interact synergistically to proauce a wide band high gain antenna. The antenna utilizes the principle of maximum radiation efficiency of a half wave radiator whose mechanical length has been reduced, yet maintaining an electrical length enabling a single radiator to be used for a number of frequencies without serious detrimental loss in gain. In most instances, one length is sufficient providing that the correct centre frequencies are selected. However, in the case of VHF reception in difficult areas, two lengths can be used instead of overtone channels. If the conical radiator 2 is to operate as a half wave antenna, its overall length is shorter than the free space half wavelength. This is the result of the large end effect produce by the bases of the cones forming the biconical radiator 2. The bases of the cones are curved to match the corona field lines around the ends of the biconical radiator. As the apex angle a , is increased, the length of the biconical radiator is decreased. For example if angle9is 100 the overall length required is approximately 75 of the free space half wavelength. With at 200, the length is only about 70 of a free space half wavelength. When such short lengths are used, the input impedance of the biconical radiator is approximately 40 onms.When the conical antenna is operated as a full wave antenna, as in the case of UHF reception, the overall length is usually 73 of a free space wavelength. The input impedance increases with decreasing length of the biconical radiator. With an apex angle e of 100, the input impedance is approximately 950 ohms with an apex angle of 20 , the input impedance is approximately 60 ohms and with an apex angle of 30 , the input impedance is approximately 300 ohms. Lower impedances can be obtained by increasing the apex angle o and reducing the radiator length accordingly. The inductance and capacitance of the biconical radiator 2 vary along the length thereof, thereby resulting in a broad resonance rather than a narrow resonant peak.Further, there is a corona around the outer ends of the cones of the biconical radiator 2. This corona is enhanced by reflection of incident radiation by the reflector 3. The radiator has a fairly large capacity but a small inductance per unit length which reauces the effective Q of the antenna and causes its characteristics to change more slowly as the frequency is varied away from resonance thereby providing a broad band response. As the apex angle 8 increases, the band width of the biconical radiator increases, but as the gain also decreases, the width of the frequency band must be kept to certain limits in order to obtain useful input signal strength. The biconical radiator 2, when used for transmitting, radiates its maximum energy at right angles to the longituainal axis of the radiator, and little energy is radiated in the direction of the longitudinal axis. When the radiator 2 is used for reception, it receives maximum energy at right angles to the cones and negligible energy is received in the direction of the longitudinal axis. When the biconical radiator 2 is mounted with its longitudinal axis vertical, without directors or reflectors , it will radiate equally in all horizontal directions. When mounted horizontally, its radiation pattern will resemble a vertical donut where the maximum radiation will be at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the radiator 2. The assembly construction of the biconical radiator 2 is shown in Fig. 6. The radiator 2 comprises a pair of cones 21 and 22. Referring to the bottom cone, the cone 22 is connected at its apex to a metal connector 10 which engages in a four way junction box 15. A wire connector 12, which forms one terminal of the antenna lead, is connected to the cone 22 by being sweated into the metal connector 10. Fig. 6 shows the top cone 21 when assembles with the junction box 15. The cones 21 and 22 are terminated on two way electrical connectors in the junction box 15 which enables connection to the 300 ohm TV ribbon lead in to the transmitter or receiver . The assembly construction described above is given by way of example only and other suitable constructions can be used. The parabolic reflector dish 3 is mounted at one end of the rod 1 with its concave surface facing the biconical radiator 2, as shown in Fig. 1. The design of the reflector 3 follows the fundamental rules of optics since both light and radio TV signals are propagating electromagnetic waves.It has been found that the parabola is the most efficient shape for a reflector in order to obtain maximum gain and maintain in phase reflective components at the radiator.The parabolic reflector has the important property that it directs parallel rays from different sources onto its focal point, ana conversely, it concentrates rays from a source at its focal point into an intense beam parallel to the axis of the parabola. This results in considerable gain determinea by the size of the parabola in terms of wavelength. Although known parabolic reflectors generally have been applied to frequencies above the microwave region, it has been found that the same principles can be applied to VHF.With VHF, the actual wavelength approximates the dimensions of the reflector, with the result that losses are experienced due to resonance, noise, and phase variations.Nevertheless, significant gain can be obtained. The aegree of gain and the narrowness of the beam will be determined by the dimensions of the parabolic reflector in terms of the wavelengths being used. Increasing the width and or length of the parabolic reflector increases the gain increasing or decreasing the focal length radiator reflector distance increases or decreases the beam width, respectively. However, with VHF applications the dimensions are limited by considerations of physical size. Increasea gains can be obtained at the higher UHF frequencies.

The same principles will still apply if a section known as an orange peel shape is used. The reflector dish shown in the antenna of Fig. 1 has this orange peel shape. Preferably, the length of the reflector 3 is approximately twice the length of the biconical radiator 2, i.e. A and the maximum width of the reflector 3 is approximately twice the maximum diameter of the biconical radiator 2 i.e. . The reflector 3 may be made from solid copper, brass, aluminium or fly screen mesh of these materials, or of expanded metal of these materials, provided the diameter of the mesh holes does not exceed A 12. Other suitable conductive materials can also be used. In order to maintain the parabolic shape, some form of rigid skeleton such as 2mm brass or bronze rod is provided when flexible mesh is used. As shown in Fig. 5 the reflector 3 is mounted to the support rod 1 by means of a plug bolt or nipple 30 extending through a hole at the centre of the parabolic reflector 3, and into the support rod 1. The plug bolt 30 may be made of brass, bronze, aluminium or other suitable material.If a non rigid construction mesh is used or if the unit may be subjected to high stress, horizontal and vertical cross ribs of plastic sheeting not shown can be added inside the reflector 3. Two sets of director rods 4 and 5 are mounted on the supporting rod 1 as indicated in Fig, 1. As can be seen from Figs. 2 to 4, the director rods 4 and So are aligNed with the biconical radiator 2 and the longitudinal axis of the reflector 3. Each director set can comprise a single rod mouthed at its centre point on tne support rod 1, or a pair of rods end mounted on the support rod 1. The purpose of the directors 4 and 5 is two fold.First, they act as parasitic re radiators reflecting back to the radiator 2 any re radiation from radiator 2, and secondly, they act as a lens directing the incoming radiation. The directors can be likened to passive radiators acting as amplifiers to the incoming signal.Preferably, the length of each director is slightly less than half a wavelength, i.e. longer than the raditor but shorter than the reflector. Further, the directors should be spaced at correct distances from the radiator 2 in order to achieve an in phase relationship. Spacing considerations will be considered hereinafter. Better results are obtained by setting the directors at an angle to the supporting rod 1. Preferably, the forward angle of the directors 4 and 5 is equal to the forward angle of the surface of the radiator cones. The directors can be made of brass, copper or aluminium rod, or other suitable material. The assembly construction of the directors 4 and 5 is shown in Fig. 5 and 7. Typically, the directors are metal rods of 3 4 mm diameter. The halves of the second director 4 are fitted into holes drilled into a metal connector 16 which is then inserted into the hollow supporting rod 1 Fig. 7 . The halves of the first director 5 are fitted to a double ended metal connector 17 which fits into respective portions of the supporting rod 1. Although two pairs of directors have been shown in the preferred embodiment, the invention will function with one pair of directors. adore than two pairs of directors can be used. However, with increasing numbers of directors, the antenna weight increases and it becomes cumbersome. The biconical radiator 2, the reflector 3 and the directors 4 and 5 are spaced at predetermined distances from each otner. In order to preserve an in phase relationship between the direct and reflected signals, the spacing between the radiator 2 and reflector 3 is a quarter of a wavelength. The directors 4 and 5 are spaced one eighth of a wavelength apart and the distance between the radiator 2 and the reflector 5 is one eighth of a wavelength also. With a reflector length of three quarters of a wavelength and a width of one quarter of a wavelength, the antenna has an overall gain of approximately lldb and a beam width in the horizontal of 150 and in the vertical plane of 250. Fig. 8 shows frequency response curves for the preferred embodiment known as the Jemcy antenna, and individual components thereof. The preferred embodiment will be described with reference to reception of television transmissions in theSydney metropolitan region of Australia. However, the invention can be applied to other regions by suitable choice of antenna dimensions. For VHF reception in Sydney, the lengths of the cones are chosen so that the radiator has a high gain response over the band of frequencies between 174 and 229 Mhz, with a resonance in the centre of the band at 193.55 Mhz, which gives a full wavelength of 1.55 metres.This band covers Australian VHF TV channels 6 to 12 as shown in Table 1. It has been found that at these dimensions, resonance also occurs in the frequency band of 47 to 140Mhz, whose centre frequency is 96.7 Mhz, which gives a full wavelength of 3.10 metres. This lower resonant band coversAustralian VHF TV channels 0 to SA. The radiator 2 has a slightly lower efficiency at this lower resonance since it operates as a quarter wavelength instead of a half wavelength antenna, which means that it is operating on an overtone. The provision of a second radiator cut to dimensions providing a resonance at 96.7 gg and mounted below the first radiator with a spacing of half a wavelength therebetween is recommended in very difficult far distant or badly screened locations. For the vast majority of situations in the Sydney and most rural areas within line of sight of the transmitting antenna, the single radiator will give good results. For Sydney UHF Band 4 and 5 reception see Tables 2 and 3 , the dimensions are chosen preferably to provide a resonant bandwidth from 526 to 582 Mhz with a centre resonance of 558 MHz, but this can be varied to suit particular local channels.
