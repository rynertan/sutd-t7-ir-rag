## Description
COUERING SYSTEM FOR SWIMMING POOL WATER.The invention relates to a covering system for covering and thermally insulating the water specifically in open air swimming pools.According to the state of the art, as indicated in the Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf of 22 May 1980, the system comprises a plastic sheet of lower specific gravity than water, so that it remains afloat at the surface. For arranging the foil upon the water and for lifting and removing it therefrom, it is unwound from and wound onto, espectively, a reel with crank handle arranged on the edge of the swimming pool. This procedure has the drawback of being highly time consuming, which time as a rule is not available to the customary swimming pool attendants.The invention aims at providing an improved covering system which can be implemented easily and with little loss of time. To this end, the covering system for covering and thermally insulating swimming pool water according to the invention comprises foil which is unrolled from the rolled state and arranged over the water surface, the roll off and roll up means being constitited by an elongate hollow space extending lengthwise over part of the width of the foil and by an external source of compressed air to be connected to the hollow space for filling this with compressed air.When the foil, thus provided with air tubes, is arranged in the rolled state on one side of the swimming pool near the water surface, unrolling can be effected by pumping air into the air tubes.As a result, the roll is rapidly unrolled along the water surface, so that only a small amount of time has to be spent on this operation by the swimming pool attendants.This aspect of a minor input of time on the part of personnel members is especially important in the putting in position of the covering, since it has be done after the closing hour of the swimming pool when the attendants have many tasks to perform, such as cleaning and tidying up, with which the official working hours are fully occupied. The covering is removed in the morning be for the opening hour of the swimming pool. Although more time is th r available to the attendants for this operation, it is nevert heless desirable to shorten the time required for it, for which reason the system, according to a further elaboration of the invention, has also been so adapted as te enable the removal of the covering foil to be carried oust in a simple manner.To this end, the air tube is internally fitted with a laminated spring which is capable of coiling and stretching, and the spring tension of which is such that, below a given air pressure in the air tube, the foil is caused to roll up. The foil is held in the unrolled state against the spring tension of the spiral spring by maintaining the air pressure in the air tubes after the unrolling operation. When the foil must be removed from the water surface, the pressure in the air tubes is gradually lowered until the air is finally released from them entirely, during which process the foil rolls up.Pressurization of the air tubes for a duration like for instance an entire night can be avoided by yet another elaboration of the invention, according to which the air tube is fitted internally with a laminated spring which, viewed in cross section, assumes a curved shape in its stretched state, in such a way that, in a manner belonging to the state of the art, the laminated spring persists in the fully stretched state for as long as no initial coiling motion is imparted to the spring from outside. In the unrolled state of the foil with its air tubes, induced under the action of the air pressure, the laminated spring, while stretched, has nevertheless curved transversely, wich prevents it from coiling.The roll up motion is induced manually from the side of the swimming pool by imparting an initial rolling motion to the end edge of the foil, whereupon the spring, once having begun coiling, continues the roll up process.This process can be protected against an excessive roll up speed by slightly raising the pressure of the air in the air tubes.According to a variant embodiment of the laminated spring in the air tube, the laminated spring extends from the free end of the foil over a shorter distance than the length of the air tube. The roll up process under the force of the spring then takes place over only a few windings, but can be continued and completed from the side of the swimming pool with the aid of a stick or similar implement by further reeling in the incipient roll, which in the meantime has acquired some measure of firmness.In order to explain the invention, an example of embodiment will be described, reference being made to the drawing.Fig. 1 is a vertical section of a swimming pool with the covering system in the rolled state fig. 2 is a view along the arrow II in Fig. 1 fig. 3 is a section along the line III III in Fig. 1 fig. 4 is a section similar to that of Fig. 1, but with the covering system in the unrolled state fig. 5 is a section along the line V V in Fig. 4.In the drawing, the number 1 indicates the water surface of a swimming pool. Against the head end 2 of the swimming pool, a covering foil 3 is suspended in the rolled state from an air pipe 4. The foil 3 is provided at the side edges with air tubes 6, which are likewise formed from the foil material and which are connected to the air pipe 4. The air pipe 4 is in turn connected to a pneumatic pump unit 7. A stiffening end lath 8 is fixed on the free end of the foil 3. The foil 3 is held in the rolled state by means of two fastening belts 9, one end of each of which is attached to the air pipe 4 from which is can be unhooked.The procedure implemented with the covering system according to this embodiment is as follows. After the fastening belts 9 have been disengaged, air is pumped into the air tubes 6 with the aid of the pump 7. As a result, the foil 3 is unrolled and becomes extended along the water surface. This clearly is a simple operation for the swimming pool attendants, requiring only a few minutes at the end of their working time. Before the opening hour of the swimmingpool, the roll up operation can be carried out from the sides of the swimming pool by taking hold of the end lath 8 and continuing the roll up motion. If desired, the unit constituted by roll of tfoil and air pipe can be removably mounted on trunnions 11 in fork bearings 12, in which case the air hose 13 must naturally be detachable.It is then possible, if conditions require it, to clear the swimming pool of the entire system.A further elaboration of the invention also provides for a mechanized roll up process of the foil. An example of embodiment thereof is shown in Figs. 3 to 5. To this end, a laminated spring 14 having a spiral shape in its position of rest is accommodated in each of the air tubes 6. The ends of these laminated springs are attached to the end lath 8. This laminated spring stretches itself while the foil is being unrolled under the action of air pressure the fully unrolled state is preserved either by maintaining the air pressure in the air tubes or by providing holding means blocks or stops, not shown . By relieving the air pressure or removing the holding means, the foil will roll Lp under the force of the laminated spring.According to yet another elaboration of the invention, the laminated spring is of a type as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. This kind of priorart laminated springs 16 is not only so conditioned as to assume the spiral shape in the position of the rest, but is furthermore prestressed in such a way as to be curved when viewed in transverse direction. In the coiled state, this laminated spring is flat in the transverse direction, as shown for the laminated spring 14 inFig. 3, but in the unrolled or stretched state it curves transversely, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, causing it to continue assuming the stretched position. With the use of such a laminated spring, there is no need for maintaining the air pressure while the foil extends along the water surface, nor is there any need for manipulating with holding means. For the roll up process, an initial rolling motion must be manually imparted to the end lath, whereupon the foil continues rolling up under the action of the spring force.The rolling speed may be controlled by first filling the air tubes with air and then gradually reducing the ait pressure. The invention is suitable not merely for the field of application described and shown, but can be applied with advantage to all large surfaces where protection against cooling is desirable, such as football fields and other sports fields.The invention furthermore is not restricted to the examples described and illustrated. It is thus possible, within the scope of the invention, for the laminated spring 14 not to be accommodated inside the air tube 6, but instead thereof to be attached to the outside thereof.
