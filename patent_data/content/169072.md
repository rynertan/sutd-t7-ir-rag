# SHEET MATERIAL DISPENSER

## Abstract
A sheet material dispenser provides a free end portion of sheet wrapping material which is grasped and pulled from the dispenser housing transversely past and spaced from a cutting element mounted on the housing. The cutting element is dis placed in response to the movement of the withdrawn material by generating a displacement force, the cutting element being latched against displacement from a normally guarded position in which the cutting element is inoperative for cutting. A fur ther movement of the material unleashes the displacement force to drivingly displace the cutting element from the guard ed position to a cutting position in which the cutting element is in a position to sequentially pierce and cut the sheet material that is subsequently moved toward the same.
