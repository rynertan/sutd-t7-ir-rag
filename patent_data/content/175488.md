# EPROM DEVICE

## Abstract
There is provided an EPROM device having a hollow cap 7 mounted on an insulating board 1 covering an EPROM chip 4 . The head portion of the hollow cap is made of material which is capable of transmitting an UV ray therethrough. An UV ray transmitting resin 9a fills at least that space between the upper surface of the EPROM chip and an upper wall of the hollow cap 7 while a different resin 9b, having superior characteristics but not capable of transmitting UV rays, fills the remaining space under the hollow cap 7 .
