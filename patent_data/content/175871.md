## Description
PROCESS FOR IMPROVING OR MODIFYING THE TASTE AND AROMA OF CITRUS FRUIT COMPOSInONS There is disclosed a process to improve or modify the taste and aroma of citrus fruit flavor compositions of both natural and synthetic origin by conferring thereto a cooked optionally juicy, fleshy and peely, gustative character. The process consists in adding to the said compositions a product resulting from the process which consists in reacting at a temperature of between about 50 to 120 C an amino acid, or a mixture of amino acids selected from the group consisting of the following ones in their L diastereoisomeric form glycine a alanine valine serine threonine histidine arginine aspartic acid glutamic acid pyroglutamic acid cysteine methionine proline and citrulline.with a mixture consisting of a. a carbohydrate selected from the group consisting of pentoses and hexoses, b. ascorbic acid, c. thiamine hydrochloride, d. a concentrated citrus fruit juice or a citrus fruit oil, or alternatively a mixture of aldehydes derived from citrus fruits, and optionally water, during a time sufficient to develop a composition which upon dilution in water possessed the desired flavor note. There is further disclosed a flavor composition resulting from the said process, as well as an edible material comprising the said composition as one of Its flavor effective ingredients. Thls invention relates to the field of flavors, more particularly, it provides a process to improve or modify the flavor character of citrus fruit flavor compositions, especially destined to concentrated orange juice or juice resulting from dissolving orange powder, a natural or artificial citrus fruit flavor composition dlspersed on a solid edible support. Experience has shown that many foods are susceptible to nonenzymlc browning, especially orange powder or orange juice concentrates which undergo changes in odor and flavor during storage at room temperature or during the manufacturing process, for instance, through freeze drying. Strange as it may seem, consumers do not always regard such modifications as undesirable and tend to favor a juice having undergone such change in taste over freshly prepared natural ones. The consumer has thus acquired a certain degree of taste pattern recognition. This seems to be particularly the case for instance for the so called cooked note that flavorists detect among the wide spectrum of flavor characters of certain citrus fruit juices. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which results in the improvement of citrus fruit flavor compositions, of both natural and synthetic origin, by conferring thereto a typical cooked note and a more juicy fleshy peely gustative character, thus providing an edible material that better satisfies the consumer s criteria of palatability. Another object of the present invention is to provide a flavor composition destined to confer, enhance or improve the cooked note of citrus fruit juices or citrus fruit flavored foodstuffs and beverages which composition comprises having added thereto a product resulting from the above described process. The process of this invention comprises reacting at a temperature of between about 50 and 120 C an amino acid, or a mixture of amino acids, with a mixture consisting of a. a carbohydrate selected from the group consisting of pentoses and hexoses, b. ascorbic acid, c. thiamine hydrochloride, d. a concentrated citrus fruit juice or a citrus fruit powder, or alternatively a mixture of synthetic or natural occurring aldehydes derived from citrus fruits, and optionally water, during a period of time sufficient to develop a composition which upon dilution in water possessed the desired flavor note. Suitable amino acids include the following glycine a alanine valine serine threonine histidine arginine aspartic acid glutamic acid pyroglutamic acid cysteine methionine proline and citrulline. All of the above mentioned amino acids are intended in their Ldiastereomeric configuration. Preferred individual amino acids are glycine, a alanine, valine, serine, threonine, histidine, arginine, cysteine, methionine, proline and citrulline. Preferred combinations in accordance with the invention of the said amino acids include the following A. glycine a alanine valine B. serine threonine C. cysteine methionine D. proline citrulline, E. histidine arginine, and F. glycine cysteine methionine. Preferred hexoses and pentoses are for example glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, ribose, arabinose and xylose. Typical aldehyde mixtures comprise two or more of the following compounds 2 heptyldec 2 enal acetaldehyde 2 octyldec 2 enal butanal undecanal 2 ethylbutanal 2 hexylundec 2 enal pentanal 2 octylundec 2 enal trans 2 pentenal dodecanal hexanal 2 dodecenal trans 2 hexenal 2 hexyldodec 2 enal cis 2 hexenal 2 heptyldodec 2 enal hexenal tetradecanal heptanal citronellal octanal geranial 2 octenal neral octenal citral nonanal a sinensal decanal ss sinensal 2 decenal benzaldehyde trans 2 transJ4 decadienal perillaldehyde 2 hexyldec 2 enal formaldehyde. Of course, the proportions at which the different ingredients are employed in the afore mentioned mixtures play an important role in achieving the most satisfactory composition, though these proportions can be determined by a trial and error approach. The reaction time varies somehow in accordance with the tempera ture at which the process is effected and in accordance with the particular vessel into which it is carried out. The invention process can be carried out by mixing the chosen ingredients under stirring and heating the obtained reaction mixture possibly at a constant preselected temperature until the desired flavor develops. The obtained reaction mixture might be added in its isolated form, or in admixture with other flavoring ingredients, edible solvents and carriers to the base to be flavored. The methods for applying the flavoring composition are common in the art. The examples which follow give a more precise indication of some of the preferred embodiments of the invention. The invention shall be illustrated by the said examples but it is not limited thereto. The present invention is also based on the discovery derived in the course of experimentation that whenever mixtures of amino acids containing glycine, cysteine and methionine were subjected to the above described process, in combination with the cited coingredients, the resulting product showed a fleshy, juicy and peely gustative character. The presence of thiamine hydrochloride is in this case optional. In order to achieve the desired results, a typical reaction mixture base consists of D glucose monohydrate ascorbic acid a deterpenated natural citrus essential oil and a mixture of the following amino acids glycine serine threonine aspartic acid glutamic acid proline cysteine, and methionine. Typically, the resulting mixture was heated at 900C for 3 hours. The product thus obtained, when tasted at a level of 2 0 or in water see the described evaluation method in the following examples, presented a more developed cooked character with a fleshy, juicy and peely undertone than the base. Examples 1. Separate flavor bases each consisting of a mixture of 3 g of D glucose monohydrate 0.1 g of ascorbic acid 0.1 g of thiamine hydrochloride 0.1 g of TETRAROME E 1 orange, and 1 g of water were admixed with the amino acid combinations A to C listed inTable I, and were reacted for 4 hours at 90 C. origin FIRMENICH SA, a partially deterpenated natural orange essential oil TABLE IEMI6.1 tb Exp.

It is apparent therefore that by uslng the most Important amino acids alone, e.g. alanine and threonine, there are obtained products whose cooked note is less marked than by using multi component amino acid mixtures The increase of the amount of threonine in mixture 4 had a more marked effect on flavor than the increase of the amount of alanine.
