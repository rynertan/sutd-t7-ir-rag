# A method for sealing an emptying opening and an arrangement for the realization of the method.

## Abstract
A packing container of the non returnable type is frequently manufactured from laminated material which comprises a central carrier layer of paper with thermoplastic layers applied to both sides. As an opening arrangement a pre punched pouring opening is used which is covered on the one hand by a tear off cover strip pull tab located outside the packing container, on the other hand by an inner protective strip. A method for sealing an emptying opening in accordance with the invention ensures that a part of the inner protective strip 11 corresponding to the shape and size of the pouring opening 2 accompanies the cover strip 3 owing to the strips as they are applied being heat sealed to each other at the same time as they are pressed against each other by means of pressure fluid. An arrangement for the realization of the method comprises a heating device 6 with a heatable zone and an outlet 8 for pressure fluid.
