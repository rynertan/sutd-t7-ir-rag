A GrassModel 7 polygraph was used for recording femoral arterial blood pressure Statham P23AC transducer and the electro cardiogram Grass 7P4 preamplifier . Ouabain was given intravenously in an initial dose of 40 pg kg and in t second dose of 20 pg kg 30 minutes after the first dose and in subsequent doses of 10 pgAg which were repeated at 15 min.intervals as required for producing cardiac arrhythmias that persisted for at least 15 minutes. When the arrhytiias were established, the test compounds were admiinistered by infusion Harvard Model 942 Infusion Pump into a femoral vein at a rate of 1 mg Kg min. Concentration of compound was adjusted according to the weight of the dog to aflow a volume infusion of 1 ml min. The compound was considered to be active as an antiarrhyLhrnic agent if reversion to the sinus rhythm occurred and this was maintained for at least 30 min. Coronary Artery Ligation Induced Arrhythmias Adult mongrel dogs which were in the conscious state were used for the test and cardiac arrhythmias were induced by prior 22 24 hr surgical preparation in which blood flow through a coronary artery was occluded by use of a constrictor device as reported by Smith et al, 1973. A Grass Model 79 polygraph was used for recording the electrocardiogram Grass tSt preamplifier . The test compound was administered by infusion CEarvard Model 942 Infusion Pump into a sapheneous vein to one group of dogs at a rate of 0.5 mg kg min. Concentration oS compound was adjusted according to the weight of the dog to allow a volume of infusion of 0.5 ml min. The test compound was administered orally by gavage to another group of dogs at dose levels of 10 to 40 mg kg. The test compound was prepared in distilled water to give a total volume of 20 ml.Following the administration of the test compound, the heart rate,number of ectopic cardiac beats per min, and the percent ectopic beats ectopic beats ER X100 were recorded at 15 min. intervals. The compound was considered active if it abolished the ectopic ventricular frequency and caused a return to normal sinus rhythm within 2 hours of administration. Data obtained for one preferred compound namely,N 2 dietylamino ethyl N 1 methylkethyl N 2 phenyl sulphonyl ethyl urea as represented by its maleate salt ofExample 9 are shown in Table 1. The other compounds of this invention show qualitatively similar effects in one or more types of arrhythmias as represented by the foregoing tests.In general the compounds of this invention exhibit less CS side effects than quinidine or lidocaine, the sulit,cnes being superoor in this respect and at the same time exhibiting excellent antiarrhythmic activity.

Pharmaceutical Compositions The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions for administration to a living animal body comprising, as active ingredients, at least one of the compounds according to the invention in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The compounds are thus presented in a therapeutic composition suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or intracardial administration.Thus, for example, compositions for oral administration are preferably solids and can take the form of capsules, tablets or coated tablets containing carriers conveniently used in the pharmaceutical art. Suitable tableting excipients include lactose, potato and maize starches, talc, gelatin and stearic and silicic acids, magnesium stearate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. For parenteral administration, the carrier or excipient can be a sterile, parenterally acceptable liquid e.g., water, or a parenterally acceptable oil e.g., arachis oil, contained in ampoules. In compositions for rectal administration the carrier can comprise a suppository base e.g., cocoa butter, or a glyceride. Advantageously, the compositions are formulated as dosage units, each unit being adapted to supply a fixed dose of active ingredients. Tablets, coated tablets, capsules, ampoules and suppositories are examples of preferred dosage forms according to the invention. It is only necessary that the active ingredient constitute an effective amount i.e., such that a suitable effective dosage will be obtained consistent with the dosage form employed. The exact individual dosages, as well as daily dosages, will, of course, be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of a physician or veterinarian. Generally,the pharmacology on animals suggests the the oral dosage effective to correct arrhythmias will be about 3 times that of the intravenous dosage.The animal data also suggest dosage requirements will be about half that of quinidine for the more active compounds. Based on the animal data, allowing for variation in species and severity of cardiac arrhythmias unit dosages containing an amount of compound equivalent to about 1 to about 100 mg kg of body weight, are contemplated. Based on all of the above considerations, a choice in a range of unit oral dosages for humans of about 10 to about 1000 mg is contemplated, preferably about 10 to 600 mg for a more active compound such as that of Example 3A and B. Daily dosages of about 30 to 2400 mg are contemplated for humans and obviously several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. However, the scope of the invention is not to be limited by these contemplations due to the uncertainty in transpositions discussed above. Examples of unit dosage compositions are as follows EXAMPLE 61 Capsules Ingredients Per Capsule 1. Active ingredient 10.0 mg 2. Lactose 146.0 mg 3. Magnesium Stearate 4.0 mg Ingredients 1, 2 and 3 were first blended. This blend was then milled, blended again and this milled blend was then filled into num 1 hard gelatin capsules. EXAMPLE 62 10 mg tablets were prepared as follows Ingredients Mg Tablet 1. Active ingredient 10.0 mg 2. Corn starch 20.0 mg 3. Kelacid 20.0 mg 4. Keltose 20.0 mg 5. Magnesium Stearate 1.3 mg Ingredients 1, 2, 3 and 4 were blended together.Sufficient water was added portionwise to this blend with careful stirring after each addition. Such additions of water and stirring were continued until the mass was of a consistency to permit its conversion to wet granules. The wet mass was converted to granules by passing it through the oscillating granulator, using an 8 mesh screen U.S.Sieve series which has openings of mms . The wet granules were then dried an an oven at 1400F OC . The dried granules were then passed through an oscillating granulator, using a 10mesh screen U.S. Sieve series which has openings of mms . The dry granules were then lubricated with 0.5 magnesium stearate. The lubricated granules were compressed on a suitable tablet press to form tablets. EXAMPLE 63 50 mg tablets were prepared following the procedure of Example 61 using the following ingredients Ingredients Mg Tablet 1. Active ingredient 50.0 mg 2. Milo starch 20.0 mg 3. Corn starch 38.0 mg 4. Lactose 90.0 mg 5. Calcium Stearate 2.0 mg 200.0 mg EXAMPLE 64 Intravenous Injection Ingredients Per ml 1. Active ingredient 1.0 mg 2. pH 4.0 Buffer solution q.s. to 1.0 ml The active ingredient was dissolved in the buffer solution. This solution was aseptically filtered. The sterile solution was aseptically filled into sterile ampoules. The ampoules were sealed under aseptic conditions. EXAMPLE 65 Intramuscular Injection Ingredients Per ml 1. Active ingredients 5.0 mg 2. Isotonic Buffer solution q.s. to 1.0 ml The active ingredient was dissolved in the buffer solution. This solution was aseptically filtered. The sterile solution was aseptically filled into sterile ampoules. The ampoules were sealed under aspectic conditions. EXAMPLE 65 Suppositories Ingredients Per Suppository 1. Active ingredient 10.0 mg 2. Polyethylene Glycol 1000 1350.0 mg 3. Polyethylene Glycol 4000 450.0 mg Ingredients 2 and 3 were melted together and stirred until uniform. Ingredient 1 was dissolved in this molten mass and the mixture stirred until uniform. This molten mass was then poured into suppository moulds and chilled. The suppositories were removed from the moulds and wrapped. Therapeutic compositions having cardiac arrhythmia inhibiting activity in dosage unit form, comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a cardiac arrhythmia inhibiting amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof are therefore an embodiment of this invention.
