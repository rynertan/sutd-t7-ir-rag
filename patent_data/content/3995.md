# Portable workbench.

## Abstract
A portable workbench has a supporting structure defining a supporting surface 6, 7 . The supporting structure includes a collapsible leg assembly for supporting the supporting surface 6, 7 above a floor surface. A first top member 8 having an upper surface 12 is supported by the supporting structure on the supporting surface 6, 7 . A second top member 9 likewise has an upper surface 15 and the upper surface lies in a substantially horizontal plane. The top members 8, 9 also have respective mutually adjacent side walls defining clamping surfaces 10, 11 . A guiding structure is provided for guiding the second top member 9 relative to the supporting structure. The second top member 9 can be moved along the guiding structure so as to adjust the position of the second top member 9 with respect to the first top member 8 . The guiding structure is pivotally mounted so that the second top member 9 can be rotated from a first position on the supporting surface whereat the upper surfaces 12, 15 of the top members 8, 9 are in the same horizontal plane to a second position whereat the second top member 9 is in a plane transverse to the above mentioned horizontal plane so as to cause the clamping surfaces 10, 11 and the supporting surface 6, 7 to conjointly define a three point clamping system. In the first position, the portable workbench is suited for clamping workpieces having two surfaces that are substantially parallel to each other whereas, in the second position, the portable workbench is especially suited to clamping workpieces having a cylindrical or polygonal shape such as, for example, a section of tubular conduit.
