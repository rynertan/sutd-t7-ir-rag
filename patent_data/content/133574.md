# Clock frequency detector.

## Abstract
A clock detector has a D flip flop 3 having a D terminal D , a reset terminal R and a clock terminal K , a first saw tooth wave signal generator 8,9 having a first time constant for supplying to the D terminal D a first logic signal resulting from a first saw tooth wave signal, and a second saw tooth wave signal generator 6,10,11 having a second time constant which is larger than the first time constant for supplying to the reset terminal a second logic signal resulting from a second saw tooth wave signal. A first clock pulse is supplied to the first and second saw tooth wave signal generators, and a second clock pulse is applied to the clock terminal of the D flip flop. When a reciprocal of a frequency of the first and second clock pulses falls within the first and second time constants, a normal clock pulse is detected.
