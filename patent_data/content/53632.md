## Description
HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST FOR POLdERIZING OLEFINS This invention relates to a new catalyst composition useful for the polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such a catalyst composition. It is well knosm that olefins such as ethylene, propylene and l butene can be polym. rization with certain metallic catalysts, particularly the reaction products of organometallic compounds and transition metal compounds, to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight. Typically such polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and pressures in an inert liquid carrier or diluent. Following polymerization, catalyst residues are removed from the polymer by treatment with alcohol or other deactivating agent such as aqueous base. Such catalyst deactivation procedures are expensive. Furthermore, most known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins as a slurry of polymer suspended in the carrier rather than in solution at a higher temperature. The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization may be caused by rapid depletion or deactivation by the higher temperatures that are normally required. In addition, the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins usually has lower catalyst efficiencies than ethylene homopolymerization. Recently, catalysts having higher efficiencies have been disclosed, as illustrated by Scata U.S. Patent 4,115,319. While the increased efficiencies achieved by using these recent catalysts are significant, even higher efficiencies are desirable, particularly in copolymerization processes. Also these high efficiency catalysts generally produce polymers of relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. It is therefore desirable to have, for some applications such as blown films and injection molding, high efficiency catalysts which produce polymers and copolymers having a broader molecular weight distribution. The present invention, in one aspect, is a catalyst composition suitable for the polymerization of a olefins and prepared by reaction of A a tetravalent titanium compound or a complex of a trivalent titanium compound with an electron donor, B an anhydrous divalent zinc compound, C an organomagnesium component and D a halide source. If components C and or D do not contain sufficient quantities of an aluminum compound, then additional quantities of an organoaluminum compound should be added. The magnesium component is 1 a complex of an organomagnesium compound and an organometallic compound which solubilizes the organomagnesium compound in a hydrocarbon solvent or 2 an organomagnesium compound. The halide source is a non metallic halide corresponding to the formula R X wherein R is hydrogen or an active monovalent organic radical and X is halogen.Alternatively, the halide source is a metallic halide corresponding to the formula MRy aXa wherein M is a meniber selected from Group IIB, IIIA or IVAof Mendeleev s Periodic Table of the Elements, R is a monovalent organic radical, usually hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, X is halogen, y is a iiumber corresponding to the valence of M and a is a number from 1 to y.The proportions of the components of the catalyst ae such that the atomic ratios of the elements are Mg Ti is from 1 1 to 2000 1 preferably from 2 1 to 200 1 most preferably from 5 1 to 75 1 Al Ti is from 0.1 1 to 2000 1 preferably from 0.5 1 to 200 1 most preferably from 1 1 to 75 1 Zn Ti is from 0.1 1 to 200 1 preferably from 0.5 1 to 100 1 most preferably from. 0.5 1 to 75 1 excess X A1 is from 0.0005 1 to 10 1 preferably from 0.002 1 to 2 1 most preferably from 0.01 1 to 1.4 1. The excess is the quantity of halide above that which would be theoretically required to convert the magnesium compound to the dihalide. In a second aspect, the invention is a process for polymerizing a olefin under conditions characteristic of Ziegler polymerization wherein the above catalyst is employed as the sole catalyst when it contains aluminum or there is additionally employed an organometallic compound containing aluminum. Such a process is capable of producing more than a million pounds of olefin polymer or copolymer per pound of transition metal. The resulting olefin polymers generally contain lower amounts of catalyst residues than polymers produced with conventional catalyst even after treating to remove residual catalyst.Further, these polymers have a relatively broader molecular weight distribution. The present invention is most advantageously practiced in a polymerization process where In an a olefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight contol agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalyst. It is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low temperature and pressure, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are aliphatic a monoolefins or a diolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms. Illustratively, such aolefins can include ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, 3 methylbutene l, 4 methyipentene l, hexene 1, octene l, dodecene 1, octadecene l, and 1,7 octadiene. Also the a olefins may be copolymerized with other a olefins and or with small amounts, e.g., up to about 25 weight percent based on the polymer, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, a methylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers suitable with Ziegler catalysts.Most benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic a monoolefins, particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethylene and up to 50, especially from 0.1 to 40, weight percent of propylene, butene l, hexene l, octene l, 4 methylpentene l, 1,7 octadiene or similar a olefin or diolefin based on total monomer. The anhydrous zinc compounds are required to obtain a broader molecular weight distribution. Suitable zinc compounds include those zinc compounds represented by the formula Zn Q m wherein Q is an anion such a halide such as chloride or bromide, or hydroxide, carboxylate, carbonate, nitrate, sulfate, mixtures thereof and m is two 2 divided by the valence of Q. Preferably zinc compounds represented by the formula R2Zn or RZnX whereinR and X are employed. Particularly suitable zinc compounds include, diethyl zinc, diphenyl zinc, ethyl zinc chloride, and mixtures thereof Advantageously, the tetravalent titanium compound has the empirical formula TiXn OR 4 n whereinX is a halogen, particularly chlorine or bromine, R is an alkyl or an aryl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and n has a value of 0 to 4. Such titanium compounds are preferably derived from the titanium halides wherein one or more of the halogen atoms are replaced by an alkoxy or aryloxy group. Exemplary compounds include tetra n butoxy titanium, di n butoxy titanium dichloride, monoethoxy titanium trichloride, and tetraphenoxytitanium. Advantageously, the trivalent titanium complexes has the empirical formula TiZ3 L X whereinZ is halide, and L is an electron donating compound such as water or an organic electron donor, e.g., alcohol, ether, ketone, amine or olefin, and x is a number from 1 to 6. Usually, the organic electron donor has from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and donates an unshared pair of electrons to the complex. In preferred complexes, Z is chloride or bromide, most preferably chloride, and L is alcohol, especially an aliphatic alcohol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as isopropyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol.While the exact structure of the complexes are not known, they are believed to contain 3 valence bonds to the halide ions and 1 to 6, preferably 2 to 4, coordination bonds to the electron donating compound. The titanium halide complexes are most advantageously prepared by heating the trivalent titanium halide dispersed in the electron donating compound under nitrogen or similar inert atmosphere. Usually the formation of the complex is visually indicated by a definite change in color.For example, when the dark purple a TiCl3 is heated in anhydrous isopropyl alcohol under nitrogen, complex formation is indicated by the formation of a brilliant blue solution. The complexes are normally solid however, liquid complexes would be suitable. In addition to a TiCls, the A, y and p crystalline forms of titanium trichloride are advantageously employed in the preparation of the complex.Also suitable are titanium tribromide and titanium trifluoride. Of the foregoing, the A and a forms of titanium trichloride are preferred. Exemplary electron donating compounds include C1 C10 aliphatic alcohols, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, n propyl alcohol, butanol as well as C1 C12 ethers, ketones, aldehydes, amines, olefins and water. The preferred organomagnesium component is a hydrocarbon soluble complex of the formula MgR 2 x y wherein R is independently hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy,M is aluminum, zinc or mixtures thereof and x is about 0.001 to 10, especially from about 0.15 to about 2.5 and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl groups which corresponds to the valence of M. As used herein, hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyloxy are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals.Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being especially preferred. Likewise, preferably, hydrocarbyloy is alkoxy, cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkenyloxy and similar oxyhydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyloxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being preferred. Hydrocarbyl is preferred over hydrocarbyloxy. This complex is prepared by reacting particulate magnesium such as magnesium turnings or magnesium granules, magnesium powder and the like with about a stoichiometric amount of hydrocarbyl halide, illustrated as R X. The resulting hydro carbon insoluble I igR 2 is solubilized by adding the organometallic compound such as AlR 3 or mixtures thereof with ZnR 2. The amount of organometallic compounds which is added to the MgR 2 to form the organomagnesium complex should be enough to solubilize at least about 5 weight percent of MgR 2, preferably at least about 50 weight percent and especially preferred all the MgR 2. When employing a mixture of ATR 3 and ZnR 2 to solubilize MgR 2 the atomic ratio of Zn to Al is from 3000 to 1 to 0.1 to 1, preferably from 350 to 1 to 1 to 1.To obtain maximum catalyst efficiency at polymerization temperatures above 1800C., it is desirable to minimize the amount of aluminum in the complex and total catalyst.Accordingly, for catalysts having Al to Ti atomic ratios less than 120 to 1, it is desirable to have Mg to Al atomic ratios more than 0.3 to 1, preferably from 0.5 to 1 to 10 to 1. Organometallic compound s other than A1R 3, ZnR 2 or mixtures thereof which also solubilize the organomag nesiun compound in hydrocarbon are employed in beneficial amounts, usually an amount sufficient to produce an atomic ratio of 0.01 1 to 10 1 of metal of the organometallic compounds to magnesium. Examples of such organometallic compounds include boron trialkyls such as boron triethyl.alkyl silanes such as dimethyl silane and tetraethyl silane, alkyl tin and alkyl phosphorous compounds. Alternatively, organomagnesium compounds can be used as the organomagnesium component particularly when rendered soluble in hydrocarbon by addition of ether, amine, etc. ilore recently such compounds have been made hydrocarbon soluble as taught in Kamienski U.S. 3,646,231. These organomagnesium compounds are most desirable if an organomagnesium compound is to be used as the organomagnesium component. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a hydrocarbon soluble dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls. Exemplary magnesium dialkyls include n butylsec butyl magnesium, diisopropyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, isopropyln butyl magnesium, ethyl n hexyl magnesium, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium and others wherein the alkyl has from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms. Exemplary magnesium diaryls include diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and particularly ditolylmagnesium. Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. The preferred halide sources are the active non metallic halides of the formula R X including hydrogen halides and active organic halides such as t alkyl halides, allyl halides, benzyl halides and other active hydrocarbyl halides. By an acitve organic halide is meant a hydrocarbyl halide that contains a labile halogen at least as active, i.e., as easily lost to another compound, as the halogen of sec butyl chloride and preferably as active as t butyl chloride. Active organic dihalides, trihalides and other polyhalides are also suitably employed. Examples of preferred active non metallic halides include hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, t butyl chloride, t amyl bromide, allyl chloride, benzyl chloride, crotyl chloride, methylvinyl carbinyl chloride, a phenylethyl bromide, and diphenyl methyl chloride. Most preferred are hydrogen chloride, t butyl chloride, allyl chloride and benzyl chloride. Suitable metallic halides as set forth by formula hereinbefore are organometallic halides and metal halides wherein the metal is in Group IIB, IIIA or IVA of rlendeleevss Periodic Table of Elements.Preferred metallic halides are aluminum halides of the formula A1R3 aXa wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl such as alkyl, X is a halogen, and a is a number from 1 to 3. Most preferred are alkylaluminum halides such as ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, diethylalumiunum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, and diethylaluminum bromide, with ethyl aluminum dichloride being especially preferred. Alternatively, a metal halide such as aluminum trichloride or a combination of aluminum trichloride with an alkyl aluminum halide or a trialkyl aluminum compound may be employed. The organic moieties of the aforementioned organomagnesium, e.g., R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g., R and R , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventional Ziegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e., those sufficiently active to react with the Zerewit . inoff reagent. In cases wherein neither the organomagnesium component nor the halide source contains aluminum, it is necessary to include in the total catalyst an aluminum compound such as an alkyl aluminum compound, e.g., a trialkyl aluminum, an alkyl aluminum halide or an aluminum halide. In order to maximize catalyst efficiency, the catalyst is prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst in an inert liquid diluent in the following especially preferred order organomagnesium compound, halide source, zinc compound, aluminum compound if required, and titanium compound or complex. However, the zinc compound, additional aluminum compound or both can be added as a separate side stream which comes into contact with the other components of the catalyst composition prior to entry into the polymerization reactor. Also the zinc compound, additional aluminum compound or both may be fed separately to the reactor coming into contact with the other catalyst components in the reactor. If polymerization temperatures below 1800C are employed, the atomic ratios of Al Ti may be from about 0.1 1 to about 2000 1, preferably from 1 1 to 200 1.However, when polymerization temperatures above 1800C are employed, the aluminum compound is used in proportions such that the Mg Al ratio is more than 0.3 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 10 1, and Al Ti ratio is less than 120 1, preferably less than 50 1. The use of very low amounts of aluminum necessitates the use of high purity solvents or diluents in the polymerization zone and, other components should be essentially free of impurities which react with aluminum alkyls. Otherwise, additional quantities of an organometallic compound must be used to react with such impurities. Moreover, in the catalyst the aluminum compound should be in the form of trialkyl aluminum or alkyl aluminum halide substantially free of alkyl aluminum dihalide. The catalyst components are preferably combined carried out in the presence of an inert diluent such that the resultant slurry is from 0.005 to 1.0 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium. Suitable inert organic diluents include liquified ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, and industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and having boiling points in the range from 50 to 2000C. Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, amd decalin. Mixing of the components to provide the desired catalyst is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, or argon at temperatures in the range from 100 to 2000C, preferably from about 0 to 1000C. The period of mixing is not critical as an active catalyst composition usually forms in 1 minute or less. In the preparation of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble and insoluble components. Polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the above catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing a olefin monomer, or vice versa at temperatures in the range from 0 to 3000C, and preferably at solution polymerization temperatures, e.g., from 1300 to 2500C for a residence time of about a few seconds to several days, preferably 15 seconds to 2 hours. It is generally desirable to use sufficient catalyst to provide from 0.0001 to 0.1 millimoles titanium per liter of diluent. However, that the most advantageous catalyst concentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent an presence of catalyst poisons. The foregoing range normally gives maximum catalyst yields in terms of weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. Generally an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer is employed as a carrier. To realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst, care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer. For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed about 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. To optimize catalyst yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range of from 1 to 10 weight percent, most advantageously from 1.2 to 2 weight percent. To achieve this, when an excess of ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen can be employed to control the molecular weight of the resultant polymer in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of hydrogen produce generally lower molecular weight polymers. Hydrogen can be added to the reactor with a monomer stream or separately before, during, or after addition of the monolller. The polymerization pressures preferably are relatively low, e. g., from 50 to 1000 psig 3.5 70 kg cmê gauge , especially from 100 to 700 psig 7.0 42 kg cmê gauge . However, polymerization can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to the pressure limit of the equipment.During polymerization, stirring is desirable to obtain better temperature control and maintain uniform polymerization conditions. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalyst in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalyst and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by stirring or other.means. Agitation can be continued during polymerization, but in some instances, the polymerization in an unstirred zone is desirable. Adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization including reflexing monomer and diluent. The polymerization can be effected in batch or continuous manner, such as, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling medium to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is recovered from the polymerization mixture by removing any unreacted monomer and solvent.No further purification is required, In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of conventional catalyst deactivating reagent. The resultant polymer contains insignificant amounts of catalyst residue and possesses a relatively broad molecular weight distribution. The following examples are given to illustrate the inventions. All percentages are by weight and all parts are by molar or atomic ratio unless otherwise indicated. The melt index values 12 and I10 were determined by the method of ASTM D 1238 70 and the density values were determined by ASTM D 1248 74. EXAMPLES 1 8 and COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS A and B A. PreParation of Anhydrous MgCl2 To 39.68 ml 0.025 moles of 0.63 M di n hexyl magnesium was added 460.32 ml of 2,214 trimethylpentane isooctane . Anhydrous electronic grade HC1 was passed through the solution until a light yellow color persisted. Excess HC1 was stripped from the mixture by passing dry N2 through the solution. B. Preparation of the Catalvst Com.oosition The catalyst composition was prepared by adding with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to a 4 ounce 118.28 cc serum bottle the following components in the following order 87.40 x y ml of 2,2,4 trimethylpentane 12.0 ml of 0.05 M MgCl2 as prepared above x ml of 0.85 M diethyl zinc DEZ y ml of 1.00 M triethyl aluminum ATE 0.60 ml of 0.025 Dl tetra isopropyl titanate Ti OiPr 4 100.0 ml The temperature of the serum bottles was maintained at ambient temperature about 220C .Depending on the ratio of the concentration of DEZ toATE, the catalyst was observed to darken over a period of about 10 minutes. After this time, there was no significant change in catalyst color. The quantities of DEZ and ATE and the atomic ratios of the catalyst components are given in Table I.

Polymerization Ex. 1 5 and Comparative Experiment A A stirred batch reactor containing 2 liters of 2,2,4 trimethylpentane isooctane was heated to 150 C. The solvent vapor pressure was 40 psig 2.8 kg cmê .To this was added 10 psig 0.70 kg cmê of hydrogen and 130 psig 9.1 kg cmê of ethylene for a total reactor pressure of 180 psig 12.7 kg cmê . An amount of the above catalyst was injected into the reactor 10 ml 0.0015 m Moles Ti , and the reactor pressure was maintained constant at 180 psig 12.7 kg cm2 with ethylene. The total reaction time was 30 minutes. The quantities of catalyst and polymerization results are given in Table II. D. Polymerization Ex. 6 8 and Comparative Experiment A The catalyst preparation was identical to that given above. In these examples, the polymerization was conducted at 80 C slurry conditions . The solvent vapor pressure was 1 atmosphere and 80 psig 5.6 kg cmê of hydrogen was added. To this was added 120 psig 8.4 kg cmê of ethylene for a total reactor pressure of 200 psig 14.0 kg cmê . All other parameters are the same. The results of these examples are given in Table II. When comparing two samples of polymer, it is necessary for the melt indices 12 of the samples to be similar since the I,o I2 ratio is inversely proportional to the melt index. The value of the I1o I2 ratio is a reflection of the molecular weight distribution of the polymer since a broad molecular weight distribution is indicated by a large Ii 0 12 ratio while a small ratio indicates a relatively narrow distribution. A broad distribution is desirable in film resins because the broadened distribution leads to higher polymer melt strengths which in turn lead to improved film fabrication conditions. In addition, a broad molecular weight distribution is desirable in injection molding resins due to improved rheological i.e., processing properties. In Table II, comparative experiment A can be compared with examples 1 and 8 on the basis of similar melt indices. It can be seen that from 2.5 to 4.5 110 12 units of broadening results using the improved catalyst of this invention. Comparative experiment B can be compared with examples 6 and 7. The amount of broadening observed is 2.4 and 3.5 110 12 units, respectively.The resins produced using this novel catalyst system thus show more desirable properties for film and injection molding applications than the resins made by the catalysts in the comparative experiments.

EXAMPLES 9 15 and COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENT C A. Catalyst Presaration The catalyst composition was prepared by adding with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to a 4 ounce 118.28 cc serum bottle the following components in the following order 97.53 x y ml of 2,2,4 trimethylpentane 0.97 ml of 0.63 N n butyl ethyl magnesium BEM 0.90 ml of 0.50 M tin IV chloride SnCl4 x ml of 0.85 M diethyl zinc DEZ y ml of 1.00 M triethyl aluminum ATE 0.60 ml of 0.025 M tetraisopropyl titanate Ti OiPr 4 100.00 ml The order of addition in this case is extremely important since it is necessary to convert the BEM toMgCl2 with the SnCl4 before adding the other components. When SnCl4 is employed as the halide source, it is necessary to add a small amount, at least 1 atom of Al per atom of Ti, of an aluminum compound before adding the titanium source in order to form an active catalyst. The quantities of DEZ and ATE and the atomic ratios of the catalyst components are given in Table III.

Again there is about 1.2 o I2 units of broadening at this higher melt index value. Thus, the resin from example 10 shows more desirable film and injection molding properties than the resin in comparative experiment C.

The catalyst composition was also employed in a continuous operation. The following examples are given to illustrate possible uses of the invention in a continuous process.EXAMPLES 16 21 A. Catalyst Preparation The catalyst composition was prepared by adding with stirring under. a nitrogen atmosphere to a 30 liter catalyst vessel the following components in the following order Isopar E 40 parts magnesium alkyl n butyl s ec butyl Mg or di n hexyl g 82 parts anhydrous hydrogen chloride HC1 1 part tetraisopropyl titanate Ti OiPr 4 24 parts triethylaluminum ATE 24 parts diethyl zinc DEZ The Isopare E was employed in a quantity which provided 0.000132 parts by weight of Ti per part by weight of catalyst composition. The order of addition is important since magnesium alkyls can over reduce the Ti OiPr 4. Also, if DEZ is present when the HC1 is added, it will fall out of solution as the metal chloride. B. Polymerization A spherical, 50 gallon 227 liter , constantstirred vessel with ethylene feed to the bottom was used as the reactor. Isopar E, a mixture of C8C12 saturated hydrocarbons, was used as the solvent. Reactor temperature was maintained at 190 C, 2 C, and the reactor pressure was maintained at 500 psig 35.2 kg cm2 throughout the runs. Hydrogen was added as a molecular weight control. Residence time for the catalyst in the reactor was 50 minutes. The catalyst efficiency and polymerization results are given in Table V. EXAMPLES 22 31 A. Catalyst Preparation The catalyst composition was prepared by adding with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to a 30 liter catalyst vessel in the following order Isopar E 40 parts magnesium alkyl n butyl sec butyl Mg or di n hexyl Mg 82 parts anhydrous hydrogen chloride HC1 1 part tetraisopropyl titanate Ti OiPr 4 18 parts triethylaluminum ATE The Isopar E was employed in a quantity which provides 0.000132 parts by weight of Ti per part by weight of catalyst composition. Again the order of addition is important for the same reasons given for Examples 16 21. The DEZ is placed in a second vessel and pumped so that it interacts with the above prepared catalyst at the time it enters the polymerization reactor. This is accomplished by employing dual catalyst feed lines which come together just prior to entering the reactor. In this manner, the amount ofDEZ entering the reactor, and therefore the ratio ofZn Ti and Zn Al, can be varied independently of the catalyst make up. B. Polmerization Each of the catalysts were employed to polymerize ethylene using the conditions for Examples 16 21. The results are given in Table V.COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS D H The catalyst of Examples 22 31 was employed using the polymerization procedure of Examples 16 21, i.e., no zinc compound was employed. The results are given in Table V. The following comparisons can be made on the continuous scale samples based on melt index. Comparative experiment D can be compared with example 16. The amount of broadening for example 16 is almost 5 110 12 units. Another indication of broadening is the fact that the melt index of the two samples is nearly identical, but the peak molecular weight of example 16 is lower, indicating more high molecular weight material is present. Comparative experiment E can be compared with examples 22 and 27. The amount of I1o I2 broadening was 1.3 and 3.2 units, respectively. In both cases the peak molecular weight for the examples was much lower than for the comparative experiment, indicating more high molecular weight material present. Comparative experiment F may be compared with examples 19, 26 and 29. The amount of broadening was 0.1, 0.4 and 2.0 110 12 units respectively, with the peak molecular weights again being lower for the examples. Comparative experiment G can be compared with examples 20 and 24. The amount of broadening was 0.5 and 0.7 I10 I2 units, respectively. Comparative experiment H can be compared with example 21. The Ilo I2 broadening was 0.2 units. The examples in Table V would all show superior film and injection molding properties when compared to the comparative experiments also listed in Table V.

EXAMPLES 32 42 A. Catalyst Preparation The catalyst composition was prepared by adding with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to a 50 gallon 227 liter catalyst vessel the following components in the following order Isobars E 40 parts of n butyl sec butyl magnesium 82 parts of anhydrous hydrogen chloride HC1 1 part of tetraisopropyl titanate Ti OiPr 4 20 parts of diethyl zinc DEZ The Isobar E was employed in a quantity which provided 0.000132 parts by weight of Ti per part by weight of catalyst composition. The order of addition is important as has been previously discussed. In a separate 10 gallon 45.5 liter vessel, a 0.15 weight percent solution of ATE was prepared by diluting 1 part by weight of 15 ATE with 99 parts by weight of solvent. This solution was side streamed into the reactor along with the catalyst composition to serve as the co catalyst. By side streaming the ATE, the catalyst efficiency can be optimized and the ratio of Al Ti orAl Zn can be varied independently of the catalyst make up.For these runs, the ATE level was optimized at approximately 15 1 Al Ti. B. Polymerization A cylindrical, 25 gallon 113.8 liter , constantstirred vessel with separate ethylene and catalyst feed to the bottom was used as the reactor. Isopar E, a mixture of C8 cl 2 saturated hydrocarbons, , was used as the solvent with a solvent flow of 700 pounds 317.5 kg per hour. Rector temperature was maintained at 1900C, i 2 C, and the reactor pressure was maintained at 500 psig 35.2 kg cm2 throughout the runs. Ethylene conversion ranged from 84 95 with a production rate of 85 iS pounds 38.6 2.3 kg per hour. Hydrogen was added as a molecular weight control. Residence time for the catalyst in the reactor was 10 minutes. The catalyst efficiency was from 0.50 to 0.60 M num Polymer num Ti.Polymerization results are given in Table VI. COMPARATIVE EXPERItENTS I O The catalyst of Examples 32 42 was employed except that the 20 parts of diethyl zinc was not added to the catalyst composition. Polymerization conditions were also identical to those of the preceding examples 32 42. When the ATE side stream was optimized again at 15 1 Al Ti , the catalyst efficiency was 0.75 to 1.0 M it polymer num Ti. Polymerization results are given in Table VI. For this example of a continuous process, the following comparisons can be made. Comparative experiment I can be compared to example 32, with num 32 showing 4.5 Ilo I2 units of broadening. Example 34 shows 5I10 I2 units of broadening when compared with comparative experiment J, while example 37 is 2.8 Ilo I2 units broader than comparative experiment K. There is a difference of 1.7 I10 I2 units between example 38 and comparative experiment L. Comparative experiment M can be compared to example 39, with example 39 being 1.8 Ii 0 12 units broader. Example 42, when compared with comparative experiment N, is seen to be 1.1 I,o I2 units broader.
