# Wholly aromatic polyesters comprising 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety and 4 oxy 4 carboxy biphenyl moiety.

## Abstract
A novel wholly aromatic polyester is provided which contains specified concentrations of 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl and 4 oxy 4 carboxybiphenyl moieties and which may optional ly possess ring substitution upon such moieties. It has been found that the wholly aromatic polyester of the present invention is capable of exhibiting an anisotropic melt phase which is readily melt processable to form qualtity fibres, films, moulded articles, etc. The colour characteristics of the new polymer are excellent i.e. the polymer is of a white or pale colouration . Additionally, since the new wholly aroma tic polyester tends to incorporate a lesser number of ester units per unit weight it is expected to exhibit enhanced stability at elevated temperatures.
