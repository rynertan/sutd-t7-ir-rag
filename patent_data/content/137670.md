# Controlling seal systems in rotary regenerative air preheaters.

## Abstract
Control of the seal of a rotary regenerative air preheater is provided by a plurality of inductance sensors S1 S8 arranged around the path of travel of seal parts borne by the rotating part of the preheater. When these are sealing frames borne on hoods of a stationary matrix type preheater 12 drive means such as magnetic actuators 5 are fed power signals through slip rings 4 . When they are seal strips on a rotating matrix type, the drive means are mounted on the sector plates of the stationary body. A control circuit compares the signals received sequentially from the sensors and drives appropriate one or ones of the drive means to bring the sealing means to a predetermined axial relation ship, or to hold them there. The sensors may be paired with comparison sensors in the same environment whereby to reduce errors due to changes in temperature etc.
