## Abstract
A telephone music device 30 adapted to be inserted within the hollow portion of a telephone handset 10 . The device draws power directly from the telephone line and requires no external power supply. When the handset 10 is in an upright position, as normally utilized for a conversation, the telephone music device 30 is electrically disconnected from the telephone circuit. However, when the handset 10 is laid down, such as on a table, the telephone music device becomes electrically interconnected with the telephone circuit. It draws power therefrom and generates a musical melody which is coupled to the telephone line. Alternate embodiments can be clipped to the handset 10 or base of a modular telephone.
