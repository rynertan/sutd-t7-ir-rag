## Abstract
Two permeable to gas patterns 68 form an inner cavity 54 of desirable configuration and are enclosed by non permeable halves of the pattern box, forming an outer cavity or flow space 70 . The pattern box 32 is mounted on two plates of the rotatable cage assem bly, selectively positionable in at least three positions charge, discharge, and transfer. Above the pattern box 32 are pivotally mounted material supply means 44 , sealing means 96 , and a trimmer 46 . Below the pat tern box is a receiver 16 of an airless conveyor 14 for recirculation of the discharged unhardened material. The pattern box is connected to two manifolds 61, 63 one 63 for consecutive supply of catalyst gas and the compressed air, another 61 for axhaust and venting. After material has been blown with the help of com pressed air from the material supply means into the pattern inner cavity, it is sealed and the air is flushed out of the system by compressed catalyst gas introduced into the pattern box for about one second. Said gas then penetrates to desirable depth into material s outer layer starting polymerization and curing of its binder. After a few seconds, unsealed pattern box assembly is turned upside down and compressed air is blown into the pattern box, dislodging unhardened portion of the material out of the inside of the produced shell like product. Consequently, the pattern box is opened and the product is transferred from the apparatus to a suit able place outside the machine.
