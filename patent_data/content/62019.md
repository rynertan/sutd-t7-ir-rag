The compounds are .claimed. to have useful pharmacological properties especially as broncholytic agents.DE OLS 2 621 535 and 2 621 536 describe compounds of. EMI2.2 wherein XI is hydrogen or an acyl group and RI is H or an alkyl, alkenyl or phenylalkyl group. The compounds are claimed to have dopaminergic properties.Disclosure of InventionAccording to the present invention it has been found that novel compounds of the formulaEMI2.3 wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 5 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group having 2 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and having the hydroxy. group bound in a position other than the 1 position, or an alkenyl group having 3 5 carbon atoms other than a l alkenyl group, and R1 is hydrogen or a hydroxy group, as bases and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, have useful pharmacological properties. Especially, the compounds are useful for treatment of cardiac diseases. Thus, the compounds of formula I have an ability of increasing the contractility of the heart muscle of an animal. Thus, the compounds have a positive inotropic cardiac effect, rendering them useful for treatment.of cardiac diseases in animals including man. Further, among the compounds of formula I certain compounds are expected to have a positive inotropic cardiac effect, substantially lacking positive chronotropic effect. The compounds of formula I are thus especially useful for treatment of cardiac insufficiency or cardiac failure and other conditions wherein an increase in heart contractility is desired. In the compounds of the invention an alkyl group may be a straight alkyl group or a branched alkyl group having at least 3 carbon atoms. Symbols for numbers, atoms or groupsPsferred to below have the broadest meaning previously assigned unless specified otherwise. Both organic and inorganic acids can be employed to form non toxic pharmaiSeuti call fsacceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention. Illustrative acids are sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, citric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, pamoic, ethanedisulfonic, sulfamie, suocinie, cyclchexyleulfamie, fumario, maleic, and benzoic acid. These salts are readily prepared by methods known in the art. Compounds of the invention to be specifically mentioned are 3 3 hydroxyphenyl N n propylperhydroazepine and 3 3,5 dihydroxyphenyl N n propylperhydroazepine, and their salts. The compounds of the invention contain an asymmetric carbon atom in the heterocyclic ring moiety. The thera peutic properties of the compounds may to a greater or lesser degree be ascribed to either or both of the two enantiomers occurring. Thus. the pure enantiomers as well as mixtures thereof are within the scope of the invention. The invention takes into consideration that compounds which structurally deviate from the formula I, after administration to a living organism may. be transformed to a compound of the formula .1 and in this structural form exert. their effects.. This crmsideration is a further aspect of the invention. Methods of Preparation The compounds of the invention may be obtained by one of the following methods constituting a further aspect of the invention. a An ether or ester of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein Ra represents a hydrocarbon or acyl residue, preferably an alkyl group having 1 5 carbon atoms, or an alkylcarbonyl group having 2 6 carbon, atoms, Y represents hydrogen or the group RaD and R is as defined above, may be cleaved to form a compound of formula I.When Ra is a hydrocarbon residue the cleavage may be carried out by treating the compound of formula II with.an acidic nucleophilic reagent such as aqueous HBr, orHI, HBr CH3COOH, BBr3, AlCl3, pyridine HCl or CH3 3SiI, or with a basic nucleophilic reagent such as CH3C6H4 SO 0 or C2H5 S . When Ra is an acyl residue the cleavage may be carried out by hydrolysis in an aqueous acid or base or by reduction, preferably by LiAlH4.The compound of formula II is obtainable by reacting a compound of formula IIA,EMI5.1 wherein Ra is an alkyl group, with X2 CH2 3COOC2H5 X2 B,I orCH2 CHCH2 COOC2H5, in the presence of a base, to the formation of a compound of formula IIB. The compound IIB is then converted into a compound of formula IID along the following route. EMI6.1 Compound IIB is treated with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney nickel to the obtention of. compound IIC, in which a substituentmay be introduced at the nitrogen atom by means of a halide RX. If exchange of the group Ra is desired the ether function is then cleaved with BBr3 and the hydroxy group is acylated or realkylated in the presence of a base. The amide compound of the formula IID is converted into a compound of the formula Ii by reduction of the amide function and, if required, introduction of a group R in the manner dascribed under c below. Thus the compound of formula IID may be treated with a reducing agent, preferably a hydride reducing agent such as LiAlH4 or BH3 in an etheral solvent or a metal reducing agent such as Na in an alcoholic solvent such as n butanol. The ethers or esters according to formula II may further be obtained by several processes analogous to the processes for preparation of the mono or di hydroxyphenyl , derivatives of formula I described below. b In a compound of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein Z represents S03H, C1 or NH2, and Z1 represents.hydrogen or Z a hydroxy group may be substituted for each group Z to the formation of a compound of formula I.When Z is SO3H or C1 said reaction may be carried out by treatment with a strong alkali under heating, suitably with an alkali melt such as KOH when Z is S03H, and with a strong aqueous alkali such as NaOH or KOH.when Z is C. When Z is N2H2 the reaction may be carried out by treatment with aqueous nitrous acid to the formation of an intermediate diazonium compound which is then subjected to hydrolysis in water.c A compound of the formulaEMI7.2 may be converted into a compound of formula I by alkylation of the nitrogen atom with an appropriate alkylating agent. Thus, the starting compound may be treated with an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or alkenyl.halide or tosylate RX1, wherein X1 represents C1, Br, I orEMI8.1 in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or acetone and in the presence of a base such as K2CO3 or NaOH, or with an alcohol ROH in the presence of a catalyst, or the starting compound may be treated with a carboxylic acid NaBH4 complex RbCOOH NaBH4, wherein Rb is defined by the relation Rb CH2 equals R.Further, the compound of formula IV may be reacted with an aldehyde of the formula RbCHC, wherein Rb is as just defined, and reduced to the formation.of a compound of formula I. To the formation of a compound of formula I wherein R is CH3, which is not obtainable by the last mentioned reactions, the alkylation reaction may be carried out by treatment with a formaldehyde Na CN BH3 mixture. To the formation of a compound of formula I wherein R is hydroxylalkyl, the synthesis may also be carried out by alkylation with an appropriate dihaloalkane giving a monohaloalkyl derivative of I, followed by acid or alkaline hydrolysis.Especially, to the formation of a compound of formula I wherein R is 2 hydroxyalkyl, the alkylation may also be carried out by reaction with a 1,2 epoxyalkane. d A carbonyl compound of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein M1 and M2 are the same or different and each represents CH2 orEMI9.1 and the dashed lines represent bonds, one of which, when adjacent to a groupEMI9.2 may be open and replaced by hydrogen atoms, and M3 isEMI9.3 when MÚ and Mê are both CH2 , and in other cases Mê is R. R c is H, an alkyl or alkoxyl group containing 1 4 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group containing 1 5 carbon atoms, or an alkenyl group containing 2 4 carbon atoms, Rd is H or R1CO, wherein R1 is an alkyl group having 1 5 carbon atoms and Y1 is hydrogen or a group Rdg, may be converted into a compound of the formula I by reduction of the amide or imide function, and the ester function R1COO if present.Thus the compound of formula V may be treated with a reducing agent, preferably a hydride reducing agent such as LiAlH4 or BH3 in an etheral solvent or a metal reducing agent such as Na in an alcoholic solvent such as n butanol when ring closure is not required. When one of the dashed lines in formula V represents an open bond, the reduction comprises ring closure in a compound of the formulaEMI9.4 and may be done by catalytic hydrogenation.e A compound of the formulaEMI9.5 wherein Re is H or benzyl and Y2 is H or ReO and whereinR is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyi group as further defined above, may be converted either by direct reduction or by first elimination of the tertiary alcohol to an intermediary l cycloalkenyl compound.and then reduction into a compound of formula I, wherein R is as just defined. The reduction may preferably be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation with a catalyst such as Pd or Pt02, and the elimination reaction by heating in the presence of an.acid.f An enamine of the formulaEMI10.1 wherein Rf is defined by the relation Rf CH2CH2. equalsR, may be converted by reduction into a compound of formula I wherein R is an alkyl group with 2 5 carbon atoms. The reduction may preferably be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst such as Pd or Put02. g A compound according to the formulaEMI11.1 wherein one of the groups Zê and Z is a leaving groupX and the other is NHR, or Z1 and z2 are both leaving groups X, and X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I or OSO 2C6H4CH3, may be converted to a compound of formula I by treating the compound of formula VIII, or when one of zl and z2 2. NHR an acid addition salt thereof, with is a base such as C2H5 3N or K2C03, whereby the compound of formula VIII is treated together with an equivalent amount of an amine R NH2 or an acid addition salt thereof when Z1 and Z2 2 are both X.The conversion is carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or acetonitrile, if necessary, with simuItaneous or subsequent heating of the mixture.Free bases formed may subsequently be converted into their acid addition salts, and acid addition salts formed may subsequently be converted into the corresponding bases or other acid addition salts. The new compounds may, depending on the choice of starting materials and process, be obtained as enantiomers or mixtures thereof. The enantiomeric mixtures or racemates obtained can be separated according to known methods, e.g. by means of recrystallization from an optically active solvent, by means of microorganisms, or by a reaction with optically active acids forming salts of the compound and separating the salts thus obtained, e.g. by means of their different solubility in the diastereomers, from which the antipodes by the influence of a suitable agent may be set free. Suitably useabie optically active acids are e.g. the L and D forms of tartaric acid, di o tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphersulfonic acid or quinic acid. Preferably the more active part of the two antipodes is isolated.
