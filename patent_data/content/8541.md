# Primary cells and seals therefor.

## Abstract
A resilient plastic sealing disc 21 for a sealed primary cell has a recess the floor of which forms a thin diaphragm 22 . Grooves 25 in the diaphragm form lines of weakness along which the diaphragm is fractured by excess gas pressure in the cell to form flaps, hinged at the periphery 24 of the recess, which open to relieve the gas pressure.
