## Description
This invention relates to a liquid crystal display element using a ferroelectric liquid crystal material and a process for producing the same. More particularly it relates to a process for producing a liquid crystal display element wherein a novel process for aligning a chiral smectic C phase hereinafter abbreviated often to S Display devices using liquid crystal compositions have been in various fields, and conventional liquid crystal display devices are mainly of TN display mode utilizing a nematic phase hereinafter abbreviated often to N phase . Such display devices utilizing TN display mode are characterized in that it is possible to make the devices thin and lightweight and yet the power consumption is extremely small and since the devices utilize a non emissive display element, the display is easily seen even at light places in the sunlight, etc. and hence even when the devices are used for a long time, eyes are not tired. Making use of such characteristics, the TN display mode has been utilized for watch, electric computer, various measurement devices, etc., and recently it has also been utilized for the terminal display of personal computer, etc. However, as the application fields have been broadened as described above, the drawbacks of liquid crystal display devices such as low response speed, narrow viewing angle, etc. have come to offer a large obstacle to broadening of the application fields. In order to overcome such drawbacks, various researches have been extensively carried out, but in order to more advance such researches, it is indispensable to develop a display mode in place of the TN display mode. As one of such attempts, N.A. Clark and S.T. Lagerwall announced a display element having applied a light switching phenomenon of the chiral smectic C liquid crystal phase exhibiting ferroelectric properties see Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 36, page 899 1980 . The characteristics of this mode are higher response speed, less dependency on viewing angle, exhibition of memory effect, etc. However, in order to commercialize this display mode, it is necessary to solve a number of problems in various aspects. As a large problem among them, there is a problem of uniformity of alignment of ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules. In the case of the so called multi domain state where the alignment of liquid crystal molecules is not uniform, the display is uneven and as a result, the contrast ratio lowers or the display surface is colored to notably reduce the display quality. Thus, in order to prepare a display element having a superior grade, it is an indispensable requirement to make the alignment of liquid crystal molecules uniform. At present, some methods of controlling the alignment of liquid crystal materials having S As apparent from the foregoing, a first object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display element exhibiting a monodomain state in a ferroelectric S In order to solve the above problems, the present inventors have made extensive research in the aspect of ferroelectric liquid crystal materials, and as a result have found that the aimed liquid crystal composition is the one having a phase transition type which exhibits, with decreasing temperature, the sequence of an isotropic phase, a cholesteric phase hereinafter abbreviated often to I phase, Ch phase, respectively , S The present invention has been completed based on this finding. The present invention in a first aspect resides in The present invention in a second aspect resides in Fig. 1 shows a phase diagram of a binary composition consisting of compound 3 and compound 4. Figs. 2A 10A, Figs. 11 14 and Figs. 15A 22A show photographs by means of polarizing microscope illustrating the aligning state of liquid crystal molecules, respectively. The magnifications of the photographs of these figures are 100 times. Figs. 2B 10B and Figs. 15B 22B respectively show a chart illustrating the directions of a polarizer P and an analyzer A of a polarizing microscope and the rubbing direction of a display cell, in the respective photographs of the corresponding numbers to those of these figures. There are a number of liquid crystal compounds having determined the helical twist senses in S In order to cause the phase transition type of the liquid crystal composition relative to the temperature descending direction to be the one wherein all of I phase, Ch phase, S In order to cause the pitch of Ch phase of the thus prepared liquid crystal composition to fall within a preferred range 2 µm or more , the adjustment may be carried out taking into account the helical twist sense in Ch phase. Namely, in order to prolong the helical pitch in Ch phase, it has been known that this can be achieved by blending compounds having opposite helical twist senses to each other to thereby compensate the helical twists see Japan J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 14, page 1307 1975 . All of the compounds to be blended in order to prolong pitch of Ch phase do not have Ch phase. Even a chiral compound which does not exhibit Ch phase can generate twisting power of Ch phase in a mixture. When such a compound latently has twist sense of Ch phase opposite to that of mixture, it can be used to prolong cholesteric pitch. Besides, it is also possible to prolong the pitch by blending an achiral liquid crystal compound such as a usual nematic liquid crystal. In order to prolong the helical pitch of S As described above, the means for preparing a ferroelectric liquid crystal composition capable of relatively easily aligning S Next, the novel fact found by the present inventors with regard to the alignment of S The liquid crystal phase of practical ferroelectric liquid crystal materials belongs to S In general, the types of phase transition starting from I phase and led to S On the other hand, in the case of S Thus, it was found that even when the phase transition was carried out without gradual cooling, the aligning properties of S Next, the aligning properties of S The phase transition temperatures of compound 3 in Table 1 are as follows and those of compound 4 are as follows wherein C represents crystalline phase. The phase diagram of a binary system consisting of compound 3 and compound 4 is shown in Fig. 1. When the proportion of compound 3 is 64.0 by mol, the phase transition type of the binary system is of I phase Ch phase S The same binary system composition wherein the proportion of compound 3 is 30.1 by mol composition point 1 in Fig. 1 has a phase transition type of I phase S Further, a composition wherein the proportion of compound 3 was 54.4 by mol a composition point 2 in Fig. 1 had a phase transition type of I phase Ch phase S The same binary system composition wherein the proportion of compound 3 was 75.0 by mol a composition point 4 in Fig. 1 had a phase transition type of I phase Ch phase S A composition wherein compound 4 was replaced by the rectus enantiomer of compound 4 and its proportion was 36.0 by mol had a phase transition naturally equal to that of the composition 3 in Fig. 1, but since it consisted of components having the same helical twist sense of the Ch phase, the helical pitch of the Ch phase was small. This composition exhibited Ch phase at 145 C in a liquid crystal cell having a cell gap of 10 µm, but since the helical pitch was short, no nematic state was formed as shown in Fig. 8A. The respective alignment states in the case where the composition showed S Further, it has been found that a fact that the helical pitch of Ch phase and that of S From such a number of observation results, the present inventors have found a fact that the twist sense of Ch and S By means of the above mentioned aligning method, the alignment process of S As apparent from the above mentioned aligning process of S Ferroelectric liquid crystal materials are provided with the characteristics that they have a large spontaneous polarization, a long helical pitch in S Further, according to the present invention, it is possible to prepare a display element using a ferroelectric liquid crystal material without adding any troublesome treatment to the production process where liquid crystal display elements have now been prepared using a nematic liquid crystal mixture hence the present invention is useful as a commercial production process. The present invention will be described in more detail by way of Examples and Comparative example, but it should not be construed to be limited thereto. The cell used in the following Examples was composed of substrates each having a transparent electrode of indium tin oxide ITO coated with polyvinyl alcohol as an aligning agent and subjected to parallel aligning treatment by rubbing the surfaces. The liquid crystal composition was filled in the I phase state and alignment was carried out only by a temperature descending operation. The aligning state was observed by a polarizing microscope arranged in crossed Nicols state, using a halogen lamp as light source, and photographed without using any color filter. The spontaneous polarization value was measured according to Sawyer Tower method. The measurement of the helical pitch of Ch phase was carried out according to Cano wedge method, and the helical pitch of S A ferroelectric liquid crystal composition I consisting of was prepared. The phase transition points of the component compounds and the composition I are shown in Table 2. In Table 2, symbol and symbol mean the presence and absence of the phase thereabove, respectively and symbol means that the phase transition is monotropic. The helical pitch of Ch phase of the composition I is 40 µm or more and Ch phase in a cell having a cell gap of 10 µm exhibited N phase state. The composition was cooled from N phase at a temperature descending rate of 10 C min. in the cell to exhibit textures of S The aligning state of S To this liquid crystal cell was impressed an alternating voltage of a rectangular wave of peak to peak 20 V and the response time was measured at 35 C to give 1 m sec. Further, since a monodomain state was obtained, the contrast ratio of the liquid crystal cell was as high as 25 or more. Compound 1 is deficient in Ch phase and compound 2 is deficient in S A ferroelectric liquid crystal composition II consisting of the following compounds had phase transition points of and the helical pitch of Ch phase was 40 µm or more, the helical pitch of S Next, the composition II was filled in a cell having a cell gap of 2 µm and the temperature was similarly lowered. The resulting aligning state of S Among the components of the composition II , compound 18 is a nematic liquid crystal compound and was added for broadening the S A ferroelectric liquid crystal composition III consisting of six components was prepared in the same manner as in Example 2 except that compound 17 of Example 2 was replaced by the enantiomer of the compound 17 expressed by the formula The phase transition points of the composition III were naturally equal to those of the composition II . But the helical pitch of Ch phase of the composition III was 1 µm or less. The composition III was sealed in a cell of a cell gap of 10 µm same as used in Example 2 and led to Ch phase, but no N phase state was formed. This is because right handed and left handed helical twisting power of Ch phase become unbalanced. The temperature of this liquid crystal cell was slowly lowered at a rate of 1 C min. The aligning state of S
