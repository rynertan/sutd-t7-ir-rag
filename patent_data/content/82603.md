## Description
RADIATION rl SABLE EP0XY AGYLATE HYDROXYL COATING CCMPOSITIONS This invention relates to epoxy resin acrylic monomer coating compositions that are curable with radiation. In U.S. Patent 4,156,035, there are disclosed mixtures of epoxy resins with acrylic or methacrylic monomers that can be photocured in air in thick sections using as curing agent a combination of a Group VIa onium salt and a free radical photoinitiator, such as a benzoin ether. That patent states that epoxy resins are known to cure cationically by radiation catalyzed by Group VIa onium salts, althougn such cure can only be effected in thin 0.025 mm films thicker films require extremely long cure times to achieve thorough cure.That patent states also that acrylic and methacrylic compounds cannot be cured ctionically by radiation, but require free radical photoinitiators, and that acrylic or methacrylic compounds can be phoolytically cured in thick sections, but are subject to air inhibition at the surface, resulting in tackiness on the surface.Conseauently, an inert atmosphere is preferred to obtain tack free films. The present invention is based on the observation that mixtures of epoxy resin and acrylic or methacrylic monomers can be cured by W or ionizing radiation tack free in thick or thin films in air or an inert atmosphere, provided that the acrylic or methacrylic monomer also contains hydroxyl functionality. Such cure is effected cationically using a Group VIa onium salt without a free radical initiator. Accordingly, the present invention provides a coating composition comprising an epoxy resin, an acrylic or methacrylic monomer containing hydroxyl functionality, and a radiation sensitiveGroup Via onium salt. It also provides substrates coated with such coating comoositions and cured. The epoxy resins used in the coating compositions of the invention are compounds having more than one alpha epoxy group, whether situated Internally1 terminally, or on a cyclic structure. They can be derived from various polyunsaturated structures, incluaing animal and veoetaole oils, esters, ethers, and butadiene derivatives.A large number of such epoxy resins and methods for preparing them are described in Chapters 2 and 3 of Handbook of Epoxy Resins by Lee andNeville, McGraw Hill 800k Company, New York 1967 commercially available resins are described in Appendix 4 2 of that publication. Particularly useful and readily commercially available epoxy resins are the diglycidyl ethers of bisphenols, for example the diglycidyl etchers of bisphenol A. Anotner useful class of epoxy resins is the epoxidized esters, for example 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl methyl 3,4 epoxycylohexane carboxylate 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl 3,4 epoxy 6methylcyclonexane carboxylate ano bis 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl adipate. Any of these epoxy resins may be used in the compositions of the invention, either alone or in combination with any one or more other epoxy resins. The epoxy resins usea in the compositions of the invention preferably have an epoxy equivalent weicht from about 100 to about 1000. Another type of epoxy resin that may be used is a diglyciyi ether of bisphenol A etheritied with a stoichiometric amount of hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate. The conditions requirec for carrying out such an etherification reaction are described in U.S.Patent 4,064,026. The second comoonent of the compositions of the invention, the acrylic or methacrylic compound having hydroxyl functionality, may be a hydroxyalkyl ester, for example hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate. Anotner class of hyoroxyl functional acrylic anc methacrylic compounds is that having the general formula CH2 C R OOCH2CH OH CH2OR in which R is H or CH3 and R is C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl, or cresyl. Compounds of this class are readily prepared by the well known addition esterification reaction of acrylic or methacrylic acid with an alkyl, phenyl, or cresyl glycidylether, for example butyl glycidyl ether. A further class of compounds is that having the general formulaEMI3.1 in which R is H or C, R is C1 C4 alkylene, R is H orC1 C3 alkyl, and x is an integer from 1 to 10. Generally, these compounds can be prepared by reacting a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate with an alkylene oxide 1,2 epoxyalkane , for example ethylene oxide, 1,2 epoxypropane and 1,2 epoxybutane, using a molar ratio of metn acrylate to alkylene oxide of 1 1 to about 1 10, at about 30 to 750C, and using an initiator such as borontrifluoride etherate.In the specific case in which the alkylene group is ethylene and R is H, the meth acrylate can be prepared by the monoesterification of a poly oxyethylene glycol for example, that commercially available under the registered trademark Carbowax with meth acrylic acid or meth acryloyl cnloride. Examples of compounds of these classes include butoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, phenoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, cresoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxy penta oxypropyl ether of ethyl acrylate, hydroxy deca oxyethylene ether of butyl acrylate, hydroxy hexa oxybutylene ether of propyl acrylate and the corresponding methacrylates. The Group VIa onium salts used in the coating compositions of the invention are those described in U.S. Patent 4,058,401, that is to say compounds of the general formula EMI3.2 in wnich R is a monovalent aromatic group, RI is a monovalent aliphatic group selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl and substituted alkyl groups Rê is a polyvalent organic group forming a heterocyclic or fused ring structure selected from aliphatic and aromatic groups X is a Group Via element selected from sulfur, selenium and tellurium ,8 is a metal or metalloid, Q is a halogen a is zero or an integer from 1 to 3 b is zero, 1 or 2 c is zero or 1 the sum of a, band c is 3 or has the value of the valence of X d e f f has the value of the valence of M no is an integer from 2 to 7 and e f and is an integer up to 8. Groups R are, for example, C 6 13 aromatic hydrocarbon groups such as phenyl, tolyl, napthyl and anthryl, and sucn radicals substituted with from 1 to 4 monovalent groups such as C 1 3 alkoxy, C 1 8 alkyl, nitro, chloro and hydroxy arylacyl groups such as benzzyl, arenylacyi ano aromatic heterocyclic groups such as pyrldyl and furfuryl. Groups R1 include C 1 8 alkyl, such as methyl and ethyl ano substituted alkyl such as C2H4OCH3, CH2COOC2H5 and CH2COCH3.Groups R2 include sucn structures as EMI4.1 andEMI5.1 Examples of M are transition metals such as Sb, Fe, Sn, Bi, Al, Ga, In, Ti, Zr, Sc, V, Cr, Mn and Cs rare earth metals such as the lanthanides, for example, Ce, Pr and Nd, and the actinides, such as Th, Pa, U and Np and metalloids such as B, P and As. complex anions included by MQ e f are, for example, BF4 , PF6 , AsF3 , SbF6 , FeCl4 , SnCl6, BiCl52 ,AlF63 , GaCl4 , InF4 , TiF62 and ZrF6. The compositions according to the invention suitably contain, on a weight basis, from 1 to 99 , preferably from 30 to 75 , epoxy resin from 99 to 1 , preferably from 70 to 20 , OH containing meth acrylic compound and from 0.1 to 1CE, preferably from 1 to 10 ,Group VIa onium salt. The amounts of epoxy resin and OH containing meth acrylic compound are suitably such that the epoxy OH ratio is from 0.1 to 100, preferably from 1 to 10. The coating compositions of the invention may be applied to a wide variety of substrates, for example metal, paper, leather and cloth, using any of the usual methods of application, including wiping, spraying and rollcoat application. Suitable metallic substrates include aluminum, steel, and tin plated steel. The compositions are generally applied at a rate of about 1.5 to 35 g mê. After application, the coating may be cured by exposure to radiation for between about 0.01 second and about 30 seconds. In some cases, the coating will be cured by short exposure to radiation, for example less than one second, which is sufficient to set the film so that it will accept inks and or wet ink varnishes. Following the printing or varnishing operation, these coating may be further cured by baking bout 120 C to 2400C for between about 3 seccnds and about 5 minutes. Suitable sources of radiation are ultraviolet light and electron beam radiation. Preferably, an ultraviolet light of a wavelength below 4000 Angstrom Units is used. The electron beem radiation may be obtained from high energy electrons produced by nigh voltage electron accelerators, resonant transformers, transformer rectifiers1 micro wave waveguide linear accelerator, and synchrotrons.
