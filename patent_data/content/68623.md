# Multi purpose air permeable composites.

## Abstract
Composites, comprising organic polymric fibers and solid particles, are described which exhibit a wide range of functional characteristics. The materials are light in weight, structurally strong and are air perme able. The fabrication of protective clothing for use in chemical warfare environments is a typical use for which these composites are suitable.
