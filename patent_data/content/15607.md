# Monochromator.

## Abstract
An Ebert monochromator e.g. for a spectrophotometer, in which the diffraction grating 18 is positioned of the central optical axis 17 of the collimator mirror 13 by interpositioning a plane mirror 15 between collimator mirror 13 and grating 18 . The plane mirror may be movable to select one of several diffraction gratings. By arranging the diffraction grating about an axis 19 parallel with the central optical axis 17 a simple mechanical wavelength drive system with a common cam shaft 30 driving the grating 18 , a filter holder 36 and a rotatable slit plate, can be provided. Further gratings may be driven from the cam shaft 30 as may the movable plane mirror which selects them.
