# SYSTEM FOR ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF FORCES ACTING ON A STRUCTURE, AND DETECTORS AND OPTICAL SENSORS FOR USE IN SUCH SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A system is provided for collecting and interpreting data indicative of the effect of at least one of a plurality of forces F acting on a structure. The system comprises one or more structural moment detectors 413 , and electronic circuitry 414c, 415 for processing and manipulating signals derived from the detector or detectors 413 in such a manner as to produce secondary signals 415a indicative of the effect being monitored. The system is applicable to a wide range of end uses such as the checking of the structural integrity of aircraft and the detection of intruders within a building. A structural information detector 410 is also provided in which a structural moment detector 413 and associated electronics 414c, 415 are contained in a single housing 412 . This detector 410 can be implemented with various optical arrangements including one built around a flexible light transmission member.
