# A method for forming a conductor pattern.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for forming a conductor pattern which comprises the steps of forming a conductive layer 22 on a semiconductor substrate 21 , forming a photoresist film 23 on the conductive layer 22 , removing that portion 23a of the photoresist film 23 located on a conductor pattern forming region 22a of the conductive layer 22 , forming a first masking metal film 24a over the whole surface of the resultant structure, removing the photoresist film 23 along with that portion of the first masking metal film 24 formed thereon so that a portion 24a of the first masking film 24 remains on the conductor pattern forming region 22a of the conductive layer 22 to form a first masking metal pattern 24a , and selectively removing the conductive layer 22 by anisotropic etching to form the conductor pattern 22a . Since the selective removal of the conductor layer 22 is accomplished by the use of the metal pattern 24a as a mask, it is possible to form a much finer conductor pattern than is obtained with the use of the photoresist pattern as the mask.
