# GAMMA GLOBULIN PREPARATION FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION, PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF GAMMA GLOBULIN OF LOW ANTICOMPLEMENTARY ACTIVITY

## Abstract
Conventional techniques of purifying gamma globulin from human blood suffer from a variety of disadvantages, not least being problems associated with the removal of impurities of high anticomplementary activity. A gamma globulin of an anticomplementary activity of lower than 20 C H₅₀ value in now prepared by forming a suspension of a pH of 7.0 to 9.0 of Cohn s Fraction II for said gamma globulin in an aqueous solution of a monosaccharide, di saccharide or sugar alcohol, adding thereto dextran of an average molecular weight of 10,000 to 70,000 to produce an aqueous 2 to 10 wt. vol. solution of dextran and, after removing the thus formed precipitate, adding ammonium sulfate to the remaining mother liquor thereby to precipitate said gamma globulin. A gamma globulin preparation con taining a gamma globulin of such low anticomplementary activity is stabilized by specific amounts of L arginine, L lysine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The gamma globulin and the preparation, which may be lyophilized, can be employed for intravenous administration to humans.
