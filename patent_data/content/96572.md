# Photosensitive materials for use in making dry transfers.

## Abstract
Photosensitive materials for use in the making of dry transfer material are described which comprise two carrier sheets 1 and 2 which may be peeled apart and three interlayers. The central interlayer is an image forming layer 4 e.g. a pigmented polymer with a photocrosslinkable or photopolymerisable layer 3 on one side and an adhesive layer 5 on the other side. A dry transfer is obtained by imagewise exposing through a photographic positive 6 and peeling apart the carrier sheets. Thereafter the material is further irradiated e.g. with UV light, to give a dry transfer material.
