# Paint containers.

## Abstract
Paint is contained in a rectangular tray 10 and has provided at its surface a flexible membrane 13 having multiple openings 17 , preferably of at least 5 mm mean transverse dimension. Paint is removed from the tray by sweeping the membrane with an applicator such as a roller. The membrane remains on the surface of the paint as paint is consumed. Preferably the membrane has Figure 5 the openings 17 confined to a broad central band with narrow imperforate marginal bands 51 . The openings 17 lie in lines, or a matrix, which are inclined to the side walls 11 of the tray and which have apparent overlap when viewed along the membrane. The edges of the membrane may be downturned Figure 8 to form a paint reservoir for sup plementary brushwork. The membrane may be sealed into the mouth 91 of a flexible bag 98 which is filled with paint.
