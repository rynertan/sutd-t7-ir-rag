# Operation control apparatus for AC motors.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling operation of AC motor 1 has a rectifier 2 for rectifying AC power source U, V, W , a variable voltage variable frequency 5 , a regenerative transistor bridge circuit 3 and smoothing capacitors C₂, C₃ . The apparatus also has a diode 8 which is disposed in a DC link between rectifier 2 and bridge circuit 3 so as to be reverse biased during regenerative braking. Control circuitry 9 to 14 generates control signals for controlling firing of the transistors TB₁ to TB₆ of the bridge circuit 3 when the diode 8 is detected to be reverse biased. Braking energy is fed back to the AC power source through the regenerative bridge 3 .
