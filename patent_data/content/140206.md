# Method and circuit for oscillation prevention during testing of integrated circuit logic chips.

## Abstract
Integrated circuit logic chips often oscillate during testing because the large unbypassed inductance of the test fixture causes off chip driver switching noise to be fed back to the logic chip power supply. Oscillation may be prevented by adding an inhibit receiver 14 and an off chip driver inhibit network 17 to the logic chip. The off chip driver inhibit network provides a fan out path from the inhibit receiver to each off chip driver 15 . In response to an inhibit signal applied to the inhibit receiver, the inhibit network forces each of the off chip drivers to the same logical state, the logic state being the natural logic state assumed by the off chip drivers upon initial application of power to the chip. The driver inhibit receiver and inhibit network are employed to prevent oscillation at chip power on during driver and receiver parametric testing and during input test pattern tests.
