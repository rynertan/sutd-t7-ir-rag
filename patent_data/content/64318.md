# A method and a kit for the assay of antibodies to soluble antigens.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for the assay of antibodies to soluble antigens in an aqueous sample, in particular in body fluids, such as blood serum or blood plasma, by contacting said sample with an antigen in vitro, wherein antibodies, if present, are bound by said antigens. The invention furthermore relates to a kit for the assay and detection of antigen specific antibodies. According to the invention an antigen is used that is modified with a recognizable group, and said modified antigen is soluble in the test sample. The interaction between antigen and antibody takes place in homogeneous solution.
