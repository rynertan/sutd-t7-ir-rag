## Description
STABILIZED POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS AND STABILIZER SYSTEMS SUITABLE TO THIS PURPOSE The present invention relates to a stabilizer system for organic polymers and to the stabilized polymeric compositions containing such a stabilizer system. It is well known that organic polymers undergo degradation during their processing and transformation, and with time, due to the exposure to environmental conditions, and such a degradation becomes apparent through the yellowing and or the lowering of the physical characteristics of the polymers, such as, e.g., the decrease of the ultimate tensile strength and of the flexibiiity thereof, which are accompanied by the variation of viscosity index. To counteract such a degradation, it is usual in the art to introduce into the organic polymers small amounts of antioxidizer compounds, generally constituted by sterically hindered phenols. Said phenols lic antioxidizers are normally present in the compositions of organic polymers in amounts small and as a function of the particular phenolic antioxidizer used and of the stabilization degree which one desires to confer to the organic polymer. It has been found now, according to the present invention, that the stabilizing activity of the phenolic antioxidizers known can be enhanced by introducing into the organic polymer, together with the phenolic antioxidizer, extremely reduced amounts of at least one zinc or aluminum compound, selected among particular classes of zinc or aluminum compounds. In this way, it results it possible to obtain, relatively to the known art, a higher resistance to yellowing and or a higher stabilizing effect for a certain concentration of the phenolic antioxidizer in the stabilized polymer composition, or it results it possible to decrease the concentration of the phenolic antioxidizer in the polymer composition for a given desired stabilization level. U.S Patent No. 4,192,794 discloses compositions containing pigments and stable to U.V. light, containing a polyolefin, titanium dioxide, a phenolic stabilizer and a zinc salt of a carboxylic acid In particular, according to said patent, the zinc salt of carboxylic acid shows its activity at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 in the polymeric composition, which are not useful, to the contrary, which are detrimental in the stabilized polymeric compositions of the present invention. Moreover, according to said patent, the zinc salts do not show a synergistic effect towards the phenolic stabilizers in the absence of the titanium dioxide pigment, whilst the stabilizer system of the present invention does not require the presence either of titanium dioxide or of another pigment, to be able to exert its stabilizing activity. Consequently, according to one of its features, the present invention relates to a stabilizer system for organic polymers formed by at least a phenolic antioxidizer and by at least a zinc or aluminum compound selected among zinc or aluminum carboxylates, dithiocarbamates, phenates, or ganometailic complexes, or zinc oxide, in an amount of from 50 to 10,000 parts per million by weight ppm , as expressed as metal zinc or aluminum, relatively to the phenolic antioxidizer. Moreover, according to another of its features, the present invention relates to a stabilized polymer composition comprising an organic polymer and an amount of stabilizer system, as it has been defined above, of from 0.005 to 10 by weight relatively to the organic polymer. In the preferred embodiment the stabilizer system of the present invention contains an amount of zinc or aluminum compound of from 100 to 5,000 ppm and the stabilized polymer compositions contain an amount of stabilizer system of from 0.01 to 4 by weight. As for the concentration range of zinc or aluminum compound from 50 to 10,000 ppm , it should be observed that concentrations under 50 ppm do not produce any significant effects in enhancing the stabilizing activity of the phenolic compound, whilst concentrations higher than 10,000 ppm have generally a negative effect on said stabi lizer activity, which tends to decrease, sometimes under the values obtainable by means of the phenolic antioxidizer alone. Moreover, concentrations of zinc or aluminum compounds higher than 10,000 ppm tend to colour the polymer into which the stabilizer system is incorporated, when said polymer is submitted to the thermal treatments required for the processing and the transformation thereof. The best results are obtained by operating within the preferred range for the compound of zinc or of aluminum, i.e., of from 100 to 5,000 ppm. Zinc and aluminum compounds useful to the purposes of the present invention are zinc or aluminum carboxylate and dithiocarbamate salts, or zinc or aluminum phenates, organometallic complexes of zinc or aluminum, or zinc oxide. In particular, zinc and aluminum carboxylates may be selected among the zinc or aluminum salts of fatty acids, either saturated or unsaturated, of from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, either with straight or with branched chain. Among these, the zinc or aluminum salts of 2 ethylhexanoic acid, n octanoic acid, and stearic acid, are preferred. The carboxylates of zinc and aluminum may be additionally selected among the zinc or aluminum salts of aromatic acids possibly bearing one or more substituents such as C, C,0 alkyl or hydroxy substituents. Among these, the zinc or aluminum salts of benzoic acid, salicylic acid and 3,5 ditert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid are preferred. The compounds of zinc and aluminum may be further selected among the zinc or aluminum salts of dithiocarbamic acids, and in particular of alkyland dialkyl dithiocarbamic acids with from 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Among these, the zinc or aluminium salts of dimethyldithiocarbamic, dibutyldithiocarbamic and dinonyldithiocarbamic acids are preferred. Other zinc and aluminum compounds, useful to the purpose of the present invention, are the phenate derivatives, i.e., the derivatives of phenol, or of phenol bearing one or more substituents, such as alkyl substituents containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Among these, zinc or aluminum pnonylphenate and zinc or aluminum 2,4 ditert.butylphenate are preferred. Among the organometallic complexes, aluminum acetylacetonate and zinc acetylacetonate is preferred. The phenolic antioxidizers useful to the purposes of the present invention are those sterically hindered phenols which are used in the art to the purpose of stabilizing the organic polymers, and which normally belong to the class of 2,6 dialkylphenols, bisphenols, aromatic hydroxybenzyls, amides of P 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl pro panoic acid, esters of ,B 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydrox yphenyl propanoic acid and diphenolic spiro diacetals and spiro diketals. Examples of phenolic antioxidizers, useful to the purposes of the present invention, are 2,6 dialkylphenols, such as 2,6 di tert.butyl 4methylphenol 2,6 di tert.butyl 4methoxymethylphenol sh 2,6 di tert.butyl 4methoxyphenol bisphenols, such as 2,2 methylene bis 6tert.butyl 4 methylphenol 2,2 methylene bis 6tert.butyl 4 ethylphenol 2,2 methylene bis 4methyl 6 a methylcyclohexyl phenol 1,1 bis 5 tert.butyl 4 hydroxy 2 methylphenyl butane 2,2 bis 5 tert.butyl 4 hydroxy 2 methylphenyl butane 2,2 bis 3,6 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 1,1 ,3 tris 5 tert.butyl 4 hydroxy 2 methylphenyl butane 2,2 bis 5 tert.butyl 4 hydroxy 2 methyl phenyl 4 n.dodecylmercapto butane 1,1,5,5 tetra 5 tert.butyl 4 hydroxy 2 methylphenyl pentane ethylene glycol bis 3,3 bis 3 tert.butyl 4 hydrox yphenyl butyrate 1,1 bis 3,5 dimethyl 2 hydrox yphenyl 3 n dodecylthio butane 4,4 thio bis 6tert.butyl 3 methylphenol aromatic hydroxybenzyls, such as 1,3,5 tri 3,5 ditert.butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl 2,4,6 trimethylbenzene dioctadecyl ester of 2,2 bis 3,5 di tert.butyl 4hydroxybenzyl malonic acid 1,3,5 tris 3,5 ditert.butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl isocyanurate diethylester of 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxybenzylphosphonic acid amides of ,l 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydrnxyphen yl propanoic acid, such as 1 ,3,5, tris 3,5 di tert.butyl4 hydroxyphenyl propanoyl hexahydro s triazine N,N di 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propanoyl hexamethylenediamine esters of ,l 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl pro panoic acid with mono or polyvalent alcohols, such as methanol, octadecanol 1,6 hexanediol, ethylene glycol, thioethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, pentaerithritol, tri hydroxyethyl isocyanurate spiro compounds, such as diphenoiic spiro diacetals or spirodiketals, e.g., 2,4,8,1 0 tetraoxaspiro 5,5 undecane substituted in the 3 and 9 positions with phenolic radicals, such as 3,9 bis 3,5 ditert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,4,8, 1 0 tetraoxaspiro 5,5 undecane 3,9 bis tI 1 dimethyl 2 3,5 di tert.butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyl 2,4,8,1 0 tetraoxaspiro 5,5 undecane. Phenolic antioxidizers preferred to the purposes of the present invention are those corresponding to the following chemical formulae EMI3.1 The polymers which are stabilized by means of the stabilizer system of the present invention are the organic polymers in general and polyolefins especially, such as polypropylene, low density polyethylene, low density linear polyethylene and high density polyethylene, as well as rubbers, such as EPDM rubbers. The production of the stabilizer systems of the present invention may take place by simple blending and homogenizing of the constituents of the same system. The production of the polymeric compositions stabilized according to the present invention takes place by homogenizing between the polymer and the stabilizer sys tem by means of the techniques normally used for the introduction of stabilizers into polymers. To the purpose of verifying the stabilizing action of the stabilizer system of the present invention, measurements are carried out of Melt FlowIndex MFI of a polymeric composition containing an organic polymer and the stabilizer system, which is submitted to repeated extrusions. Moreover, from the granules of the extruded polymeric composition, slabs of 2 mm in thickness are prepared by compression, onto which measurements are carried out of the yellow index, before and after thermal ageing in an oven with air circulation, at 140 C. The measurements of the variation of melt index are carried out starting from the powder of organic polymer, which is blended with a phenolic antioxidizer, in an amount of 0.1 by weight relatively to the organic compound, and with a zinc compound, in amounts selected within the range of from 500 ppm to 10,000 ppm, as metal zinc, relatively to the phenolic antioxidizer. The so obtained blend is mixed over a 30 minutes time in order to homogenize it, operating on a planetary blender.The extrusions of the homogeneous polymeric composition so obtained are accomplished on an extruder of 19 mm in diameter, with a length of about fivefold the diameter, provided with screw and with a 2 mm nozzle, by operating with a compression ratio of 1 4 at the speed of 50 rpm and with a temperature profile along the extruder of 175 C 235 C 270 C 270 C. After each extrusion, the filament is cut into pellets. A portion of the pellets so obtained is analyzed for the melt index according to ASTM D 1238 Standard, by operating at 190 C and under a pressure of 2.16 kg, and the residual portion is submitted to another passage through the extruder.In this series of tests, as the organic polymer, the commercial polypropylene sold by the firm Montedison under the trade name Moplens RFL 20F is used, the polymeric composition is passed seven times through the extruder and the melt index after the first, the third, the fifth and the seventh passage is measured. The results obtained are reported in Tables from 1 to 3, wherein the following phenolic antioxidizers are used Antiox AEMI5.1 Anti ox BEMI5.2 Antiox CEMI5.3 Antiox DEMI6.1 Antiox EEMI6.2 These antioxidizers are always used in an amount of 0.1 by weight relatively to polypropylene. In Tables 1 to 3, the zinc compound used is also reported, as well as the amount thereof, as expressed as ppm by weight of metal zinc, relatively to phenolic antioxidizer. To comparison purposes, the extrusion tests are carried out also on virgin polypropylene and on polypropylene containing 0.1 by weight of phenolic antioxidizer, in the absence of any zinc compounds. In some cases, a sample of the pellets used after the first and after the fifth passage through the extruder, is compression moulded at 200 C, until slabs of 1.5 mm in thickness are obtained, by operating for three minutes under 4 kg cm2 and three minutes under 130 kg cm2, and subsequently cooling the so obtained slabs in water at room remperature. On these slabs, measurements are carried out of yellow index on reflectivity. The results of these tests are reported in Table 4. Moreover, in some cases, the slabs obtained from the first extrusion are submitted to accelerated heat ageing at 140 C in an oven with air circulation. The yellow index is evaluated before the thermal treatment and periodically during the thermal treatment and the results of these tests are reported in table 5.
