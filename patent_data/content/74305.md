# FAULT ISOLATING MEMORY DECODER

## Abstract
Logic elements are added to a conventional decoder to allow one or more defective blocks of columns to be isolated and one or more redundant blocks of columns to be substituted. The redundant block of columns is programmed by non volatile latches. A repair address is stored in the latches. When the decoded address to a block of columns is the same as the repair address, the redundant block of columns is selected and all other blocks of columns are de selected. Normal column block addressing is unaffected when the decoded address is different from the repair address.
