POLYMER STABILISING COMPOSITIONS, POLYMERS STABILISED THEREWITH,A PROCESS FOR STABILISING POLYMERS AlB SHAPED ARTICLES FORMEDFROM SUCH STABILISED POLYMERS This invention relates to stabilizer compositions containing 1 a hydroxythio tin compound, or mixture of hydroxythio tin compounds, 2 a mercaptan containing organic compound or mixture of mercaptan containing organic compounds, and, optionally, 3 an organotin compound or mixture of organotin compounds. This invention also relates to poler compositions containing said stabilizer compositions, to methods for stabilizing polymers by adding thereto said stabilizer compositions, and to articles of manufarture, e.g. pipe, made from said stabilized polymer compositions. Organotin compounds, particularly useful as stabilizers for halogen containing polymers, are well known in the art. These organotin compounds can provide stabilization of such polymers when used alone or in combination with various compounds. For example, U. S. Patent No. 3,503,924 to M. W. Pollock discloses stabilizers.for polyvinyl chloride resins which are mixtures containing a diorganotin mercaptide and a minor amount of an alpha mercapto acid. Pollock also dis closes, in U. S.

The stabilizer compositions of this invention have quite unexpectedly been found to impart stabilization against the deteriorative effects of heat to halogen containing organic polymers which is superior to those stabilizer compositions previously known in the art. The term halogen containing organic polymers as used herein refers to halogen containing vinyl and vinylidene polymers or resins in which the halogen is attached directly to the carbon atoms. Preferably, the polymer is a vinyl halide polymer, more particularly a vinyl chloride polymer. Usu lly, the vinyl chloride polymer is made from monomers consisting of vinyl.chloride alone or a mixture of monomers comprising, preferably, at least about 70 by weight based on the total monomer weight of vinyl chloridc. The halogen containing polymers which can be stabilized according to this invention include chlorinated polyethylene having 14 to 75 , e.g. 27 , chloride by weight, chlorinated natural and synthetic rubber, rubber hydrochloride, chlori nated polystyrene, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl bromide, polyvinyl fluoride, copolymers of vinyl chloride with 1 to 90 , preferably 1 to 30 of a copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated material such as, for example, vinyl acetate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl benzoate, vinylidene chloride, diethyl fumarate, diethyl maleate, other alkyl fumarates and maleates, vinyl propionate, methyl acrylate, 2 ethylhex.yl acrylate, butyl acrylate and other alkyl acrylates, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and other alkyl methacrylates, methyl alpha chloroacrylate, styrene, trichloroethylene, vinyl ethers such as vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl chloroethyl ether and vinyl phenyl ether, vinyl ketones such as vinyl methyl ketone and vinyl phenyl ketone, l fluoro 2 chloroethylene, acrylonitrilet chloroacrylonitrile, allylidene diacetate and hloroallylidene diacetate.Typical co olymers .include vinyl chloride vinyl acetate 96 4 sold commercially as VYNW , vinyl chloride vinyl acetate 87 13 , vinyl chloride vinyl acetate maleic anhydride 86 13 1 , v nyl chloride vinylidene chloride 93 3 vinyl chloride diethy fumarate 95 5 , and vinyl chloride 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 8O 2 In addition to the stabilizer compositions of this invention, there can also be incorporated into the halogen containing organic polymer conventional additives such as plasticizers, pigments, fillers, dyes, ultraviolet light absorbing agents, densifying agents and the like. The stabilizer compositions of this invention comprise 1 a hydroxythio tin compound or mixture of hydroxythio tin compounds, 2 a mercaptan containing organic compound or mixture of mercaptan containing organic compounds, and,. optionally, 3 an organotin compound or mixture of organo tin compounds.

Likewise, the radicals OC13H27, OC1sH37, and OC8H17 are derived from tridecanol, stearyl alcohol and iso octanol respectively. Also, it should be noted that, in an effort to simplify the foregoing formulas and render them as clear and concise as possible, some letters are used more than once in the same formula and or in more than one formula.Thus, for example, X appears three times in formula III, and also in formulae I, II, IV, XII, XIII, XIV and XV R1 appears in formulae I, II, III and XII XV Y is found in formulac III, IV, XIV and XV and i is used in formulae ITh, IV, XIV and XV as part of the definition of Y , and in formulae VII, VIII,, IX and X. It is intended that, in those instances where the same letter is used either more than once within the same formula or in more than one formula, that letter represents at each. independent occurence any group contained in the set of groups encompassed by its definition, or any and all subsets thereof.It is further intended that any modification or limitation in the definition of a particular letter at one occurence does not necessarily affect its definition at any other occurence.For example, should the definition of X in formula I be limited from sR2, Cl, Br, I, OCR8 or OB8 to C1, Br or I,X in each of formulae II, IV, XII, XIII, XIV and XV may still represent at each independent occur nce the set of groups consisting of SR , C1, Br, I, EMI30.3 and O R8, or any and all subsets thereof such as. for example. EMI31.1 and OR8 or C1, Br, I and OR8.

Likewise, the stabilizer compositions of this invention can be incorporated into the halogen containing organic polymer by admixing the stabilizer composition and polymer, such as, for example, in an appr,opriate mill or mixer or by any other of. the well known methods which provide uniform distribution of the stabilizer throughout the polymer. As, previously stated, the stabilizer compositions of the present invention comprise 1 a hydroxythio tin compound or mixture of hydroxythio tin compounds, 2 a mercaptan containing organic compound or mixture of mercaptan contain ing organic compounds, and, optionally, 3 an organotin compound or mixture of organotin compounds. Plore particularly, the stabilizer compositions of this invention contain about 10 to about 60 , preferably about 208 to about qO by weight based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition of mercaptan containing organic compound or mixture of mercaptan containing organic compounds, the balance of the stabilizer composition being comprised of hydroxythio tin compound or mixture of hydroxythio tin compounds, and, optionally, orogano tin compound or mixture of organotin compounds. It should be emphasized that the hydroxythio tin compounds and optional organc tin compounds are employed in the practice of this invention in amounts such that 1 100 , preferably 3 50 , and most preferably 5 20 of the bonds from the tin atoms in the hydroxythio tin compounds and, when utilized, organotin compounds to atoms ther than carbon are to S R3 OH groups. The stabilizer compositions of this invention are employed in an amount sufficient to impart the desired resistance to heat deterioration to halogen containing organic polymers. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the wart, that the precise amount of stabilizer composition used. will depend upon several factors, including, but not limited to, the particular halogen containingorganic polymer employed, the temperature to which the polymer will be subjected, and the possible .. presence of other stabilizing compounds. In general, the more severe the conditions to which the halogen containing organic polymer is subjected, and the longer the term required for resisting degradation, the greater will be the amount of stabilizer composition required. Generally, as little as about 0.40 parts by weight of tbe stabilizer composition per hundred parts by weight.of halogen contain ing organic polymer will be stabilizingly reflective. while there is no critical upper limit to the amount of stabilizer composition which can be employed, amounts in excess of about 10 parts by weight of stabilizer composition per hundred parts by weight of halogen containing organic polymer do not give an increase in effectiveness commensurate with the additional amount of stabilizer employed. The stabilized halogen containing organic polymer com positions of this invention may be used to form articles of manufacture, e.g. pipe. A variety of conventional molding techniques may be employed to form the stabilized Composltior, into any desired shape. The following examples illustrate this invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages in the examples and throughout this specification are by weight.
