# PROBES AND METHODS USEFUL FOR DETECTING CHROMOSOMAL TRANSLOCATIONS

## Abstract
A single stranded nucleic acid molecule useful as a probe for detecting chromosomal translocations has a nucleotide sequence which comprises at least one sequence present within an exon of a eucaryotic chromosomal gene and complementary to the mRNA encoded by the exon, the gene being characterized by the presence within it of at least one chromosomal breakpoint site into which another nuc leotide sequence may be translocated. In a specific embodi ment the translocation is the Philadelphia translocation, the eucaryotic chromosomal gene is on human chromosome 22 and the translocated nucleotide sequence is at least part of the c abl oncogene The invention also provides purified, hybrid mRNA molecules useful as indicators of chromosomal transloca tions. The mRNAs are transcripts of hybrid DNA sequences present on aberrant chromosomes resulting from chromo somal translocations. The invention further provides hybrid polypeptides encoded by the hybrid mRNA molecules and antibodies directed to antigenic determinants on these hybrid polypeptides. The single stranded nucleic acid molecules, polypep tides and antibodies of this invention may be used to detect chromosomal translocations and to diagnose diseases asso ciated therewith.
