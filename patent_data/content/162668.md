# SEMICONDUCTOR LASER

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser includes a front mirror facet and a rear mirror facet. An Al₂O₃ film coating is formed on the front mirror facet by the electron beam evaporation tech nique so that the front mirror facet has the reflectance be tween 10 and 20 . A multi layered coating is formed on the rear mirror facet so that the rear mirror facet has the reflec tance higher than 90 .
