# High calcium tolerant deposit control method.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of controlling deposition of scale and the like in waters having a high calcium ion content. The method is applicable to waters having a calcium ion concentration of about 300 ppm Ca Â² and greater and comprises adding 1 hydroxy propylidene 1 ,1 diphosphonic acid or water soluble salt thereto. This particular compound is capable of performing the deposit control function in such high calcium waters without itself resulting in substantial deposit control agent calcium adduct formation which would deletenously affect the deposit control function.
