# Heart valve prosthesis.

## Abstract
Double leaflet heart valves having an annular valve body 103 and a pair of pivotable leaflets 105 which may be arcuate or flat in cross section. Guides 131 protrude oppositely from the leaflets 105 and are received in complementary depressions 111 in the interior wall surface 117 of the annular valve body at generally diametrically opposite locations. Eccentric pivot axes provide for quick response of the leaflets 105 , and small rounded knobs 137 of the guides 131 are received in the depressions 111 which assure the alignment is maintained. The depressions 111 are preferably elongated so that, as the leaflets 105 pivot between the open and closed positions, the guides 131 move from one end of the elongated depressions 111 to the other.

## Description
HEART VALVE PROSTHESIS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to heart valve prostheses for replacement of defective natural valves and more particularly to heart valve prostheses using a pair of pivoting valve members, preferably ones which are arcuate in cross section. Various types of heart valve prostheses have been developed which operate hemodynamically as a result of the pumping action of the heart. Some of these valves which have been used employ a ball and cage arrangement, whereas others have used a disc type arrangement for the valve member. Exemplary of a disc of the free floating type is U.S. Patent No. 3,534,411, issued October 20, 1970.Various disc type valves having a pivotal arrangment have been developed, such as that shown in U.S. Patent No.3,546,711 to Bokros, issued December 15, 1970, and that shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,859,668, issued January 14, 1975. Disc type heart valves have also been developed which use two members or leaflets, instead of a single disc, which leaflets rotate about parallel axes as a part of the opening and closing of the valve. British Patent No.1,160,008 shows an early version of such a valve, and U.S.Patent No. 4,078,268, issued March 14, 1978, shows a later version. SU MARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides improved versions of two leaflet heart valve prostheses having excellent blood flow characteristics. Guides extend from opposite sides of each of the leaflets and are received in depressions formed in the interior wall surfaces of an annular valve body.The valve members are preferably curved in cross section, and each pivots about an eccentric axis. The depressions are elongated so that the axis of pivot of each leaflet changes relative to the valve body. This movement in the depressions plus the design of the guides prevents blood clotting from beginning in an otherwise stagnant region.The location of the pivot axes slightly downstream of the orifice defined by the annular valve body, essentially removes them from the region of greatest constriction and provides the valve with excellent flow characteristics.When the valve members are curved, a fairly large central passageway is created which further enhances blood flow therethrough. The heart valves open and close easily and reliably and exhibit excellent resistance to wear.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Depicted in the drawings is a bi leaflet heart valve 101 which includes an annular valve body 103 and a pair of pivoting leaflets 105 which are curved in cross section but which might be made flat if desired. The annular body 103 has an internal surface 107 which defines a central passageway 109 of substantially circular cross section. The leaflets 105 are supported about eccentric axes in generally diametrically opposed depressions 111 formed in the interior wall 107 of the annular valve body and extending into a pair of standards 113 which depend in a downstream direction from the main ring portion of the annular body. The annular body 103 has the usual groove 114 formed in its outer periphery to accept a suturing ring, and the interior surface 107 optionally tapers inwardly slightly from its upper end to provide a smooth entrance region for the blood which, in the open position flows downward therethrough in the direction of the arrows 115 in FIGURE 4. A seat 117 is formed in the lower region of the interior surface as discussed hereinafter. The depressions 111 are elongated and are located in a pair of flat or planar wall sections 118 formed in the valve body which extend downward into the region of the diametrically opposite standards 113. The leaflets 105 may be flat but preferably are arcuate or curved in cross section, as best seen in FIGURES 1 and 3, and have a nominally uniform thickness along the upstream and downstream edges. The leaflets may have the general shape of a section that has been cut from a tube of elliptical cross section however, in the illustrated, preferred embodiment, the leaf lets 105 have the general shape of a portion of a hollow sphere so that, when in the closed position shown in FIGURE 3, they together form a sector of such a hollow sphere. The upstream edge FIGURE 4 is referred to as the minor edge 119 because it is shorter in length than the downstream edge which is referred to as the major edge 121. The convex surface 123 of the leaflet faces upstream in the closed position, and the concave surface 125 faces downstream.The upstream edges 119 are substantially planar and are oriented with respect to the downstream and upstream surfaces so as to squarely abut each other in the closed position, as illustrated inFIGURE 3. The intersection between each curved leaflet 105 and the right circular cylindrical interior wall surface 107 in the region of the seat is that of a segment of a circle. The major edge 121 has the outline of nearly a complete semicircle and seals the passageway 109 when it engages the seat 117. The surface of the seat 117 faces generally downstream and may have a radius of curvature just slightly greater than the radius of curvature of the major edge 121 at the upstream surface 123, so that there is only line contact between it and the seat to reduce blood cell crushing hemolysis . The pivotal axis for each of the leaflets 105 is eccentric to the leaflet and also to the centerline through the passageway 109, and these axes are defined by a pair of opppsitely extending guides 131 carried by each leaflet which have generally parallel side surfaces 132 with terminal surfaces 133 that are preferably sections of a spherical surface. The surfaces 133 are referred to as spheriodal because, in addition to being generally spherical, they may also be paraboloidal or hyperboloidal. The guides 131 are formed at opposite lateral locations on the arcuate leaflets 105 which are flanked by planar regions 135 FIGURE 6 . The guides 131 are received within the elongated depressions 111 which have a radius of curvature slightly larger, e.g., about 2 , than that of the spherical surfaces 133. A small rounded knob 137, which is preferably a sector of a sphere, is formed centrally of each of the surfaces 133 for a purpose explained hereinafter. The elongated depressions 111 are aligned somewhere between the vertical, i.e., parallel to the axis of the passageway 109, and at a downstream angle thereto of not more than about 600. In the illustrated valve, the centerline of the elongated depressions is parallel to a vertical plane through the valve center line. Because the radius of curvature of the depressions is greater than that of the spherical surfaces, the ends of the guides 131 do not touch the deepest points of the depressions, as can be seen by the exaggerated illustration in FIGURE 5. Instead the flanking flat surfaces 135 serve as the thrust bearing surfaces and rotate against the flat surfaces 118 of the valve body. The knobs 137 are received in central slots 139. Each depression Ill preferably has a total length which is at least about 110 of its transverse horizontal in FIGURE 3 dimension and thus has a central cylindrical surface, whereby movement of the guides 131 within the depression, coupled with the flow of blood therepast, washes the entire concave surface of the depressions and serves as a positive deterrent to clotting. The orientation of the leaflets 105 in the open position is determined by stops 141 which each have a pair of generally outwardfacing surfaces 143 against which complementary surfaces 145 formed on the leaflets 105 abut. The leaflets rotate about 700 from the closed position to the open position illustrated in FIGURE 4 where they are tilted somewhat with respect to the flow path through the passageway.For a valve designed to operate as an aortic valve, the amount of rotation may be only about 600. Generally, the lesser the rotation, the more prompt is the response of the leaflets in moving to the closed position, and leaflets in a mitral valve may rotate only as few as about 55 . As soon as blood flow through the valve in the direction of the arrows 115 ceases upon the ending of the pumping stroke of the respective ventricle for an aortic valve, back pressure builds up in the aorta causing blood to attempt to flow backward through the valve 101. The backflow exerts a dragging force on the surfaces of the leaflets which is amplified by the composite moment arm about which the major surface portions of the leaflets are offset from the pivotal axis and promptly causes the leaflets 105 to begin to pivot upward from their positions shown in FIGURE 4 while the guides 131 simultaneously move upward in the elongated depressions 111. The location of the arcuate seats 117 provided in the interior surface 107 of the valve body is such, relative to the location of the depression 111, that the closing movement of the leaflets is halted when the major edges 121 contact the downstream facing surface of the seats 117. Furthermore, the location is such that, when the major edges 121 are in contact with the seats 117 and the minor edges 119 are abutting each other, the guides 131 and the knobs 137 are spaced slightly below the uppermost locations in the depressions 111 and in the slots 139 and are thus unloaded, eliminating the propensity for wear at these locations during the duration of closure when the force against the leaflets is at its greatest. This spacing of the spherical surfaces of the guides 131 slightly below the uppermost locations they might occupy in the depressions 111 is a stable position because of the strategic location of the arcute seats 117.In this respect, the geometric center of the leaflets is indicated in FIGURE 2 by the point labeled GC, and the seat 17 extends substantially past a line through the point GC so the seat flanks the geometric center of each leaflet in the closed position. Accordingly, the force against the leaflet s downstream surface 125 is borne by the downstream facing surface of the seat 117 and thus assures that the guides 131 remain unloaded in the closed position. As soon as the next pumping stroke is ready to begin, the back pressure on the downstream surfaces 125 of the leaflets is removed, and the pressure created by the cotraction of the ventricle is applied against the upstream surfaces 123. The response is immediate, and the leaflets 105 swing downward from the positions shown in FIGURE 3 with the guides 131 simultaneously moving downward in the elongated depressions 111. The downward rotation ends when the downstream edges 145 contact the surfaces 143 of the stops 141 with the guides 131 disposed at the bottom of each of the depressions 111. However, because the leaflets are oriented only slightly offset from the flow path of the blood, there is little force on them in this orientation, and wear is not a problem. In the open position, as depicted in FIGURE 4, and when moving between the open and the closed positions, the relatively flat side surfaces 132 of the guides 131 are nearly aligned with the long dimension of the depressions, and the guides might have a tendency to become canted or offset within the elongated depressions 111.The function of the knobs 137, which are received within the center slots 139, is to eliminate any such tendency and maintain the leaflets always in alignment in the valve body. Because the knobs 137 are entrapped within the center slots, the overall pivoting and translational movement is stabilized, and the guides 131 are positively prevented from moving sideways when the leaflets are in or near the open position orientation. In this respect, there is a sufficient amount of clearance between the exterior surface of the knobs 137 and the interior surface of the center slots at least about a 5 percent greater radius of curvature so that the primary pivotal bearing surfaces are the curved terminal surfaces 133 of the guides 131 and the curved interior surface of the depressions 111. In addition to being elongated, the centering slots 139 are preferably slightly pointed at each end.This pointed configuration, when added to the fact that the knobs 137 move up and down within the centering slots 139, assures a good washing flow of blood through the slots about the exterior surface of the knobs. Likewise, the relatively flat nature of the guides 131, which occupy only a minor portion of the total volume of the depressions at one time, allows entry of blood into the elongated depressions 111 during the time period when the leaflets are in the closed position, and the relative proportioning allows some leakage flow past the curved terminal surfaces 133. This flow, plus the action of pivoting and translational movement back and forth, assures a good flushing of the depressions 111 and the slot 139 and the positive prevention of the build up of any clotting. In summary, the combination of the relatively flat guides 131 in the elongated depressions 111 assures good flushing and protection from clotting, and the provision of the small knobs 137 in the centering slots 139 assures stabilization and continuous alignment of the pivoting leaflets 105. Accordingly, this combination is considered to have important advantages in heart valve designs for use both in the aortic and in the mitral positions. Although the invention has been described with regard to certain preferred embodiments, it should be understood that various modifications and changes as would be obvious to one having the ordinary skill in the art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is defined in the appended claims. For example, the depressions 111 might be formed in opposite locations on the leaflets and the guides 131 formed so as to project from the interior surface of the valve body 103. Various features of the invention are emphasized in the claims which follow.
