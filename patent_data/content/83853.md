# PHOTOGRAPHIC ENLARGER

## Abstract
In order to allow the effects of perspective to be adjusted when printing photographs from a negative an enlarger, such as that illustrated allows a holder 10 for the negative and a support 3 for the photosensitive paper to be tilted about respective axes 13 and 12. A lens 5 is also allowed to be adjusted in a horizontal direction perpendicu lar to the axes 12 and 13 whilst the holder 10 for the negative is mounted for rotation about a vertical axis 14. The Specification suggests that these various adjust ments allow appropriate adjustments in perspective to be made without substantially affecting the focus on the photosensitive paper of any part of the picture to be reproduced.
