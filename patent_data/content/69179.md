# Solar absorber panel.

## Abstract
A solar energy absorption panel 10 having a plurality of conduits 15 through which water passes to be heated by energy collected by the panel 10 , the panel 10 including an inlet 12 and outlet duct 13A 13B between which extends a plurality of extruded plastic strips 11 defining said conduits 15 .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A strip of extruded plastics material having a plurality of longitudinally extending passages through which a fluid is to be passed to be heated by solar energy absorbed by the strip, the strip comprising a plurality of longitudinally ex.tending conduits defining said passages, a respective web joining each pair of adjacent conduits, and a flat surface adjacent each conduit, which flat surfaces lie generally within a common plane so that, in use, the surfaces abut a roof supporting the strip so as to receive heat from the roof by conduction. 2. A strip as claimed in claim 1, wherein each web is provided with a longitudinal groove to enable bending of the strip about a longitudinal axis. 3. A strip as claimed in claim 1, wherein each web is of a generally t Vt1shaped transverse cross section so as to have two inclined parts which are generally tangential to said conduits. 4. A solar absorber pane3 having an inlet duct and an outlet duct joined by a plurality of strips, each constructed in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3.

## Description
SOLAR ABSORBER PANEL The present invention relates to devices to absorb solar radiation for the purposes of heating water, and more particularly but not exclusively for the purpose of heating water for swimming pools. Convenentionally, solar panels or elements used for heating swimming pools consist of an extruded plastic strip which is provided with a series of longitudlnally extending passages, usually four. More parcularly,the passages are joined by a median web. The strips are formed of generally circular conduits joined by a web, accordingly, the majority of conduits and web are spaced from the roof surfaces supporting them. However, it is generally an objec t or these known strips to heat the water passing therethrourgh by P0can. of direct absorption of solar radiation and according absorption of heat by conduction has not been considered.Accordingly, the absorber panel or strip is not in good thermal contact with the roof structure and accordingly it 5 not efficient in absorbing heat from the roof by means of conduction. It is an object of the present invention to ortercolue or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages. There is disclosed herein a strip of extruded plastics material having a plurality of longitudinally extending passages through which Ã  fluid is to be passed to be heated by solar energy absorbed by the strip, the strip comprising a plurality of longitudinally extending conduits defining said passages, a respective web joining each pair of adjacent conduits, and a flat surface adjacent each conduit, which flat surfaces lie generally within a common plane so that in use the surfaces abut a roof supporting the strip so as to receive heat from the roof by conduction. A preferred form of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 schematically depicts a solar radiation absorption system for heating a swinning pool Figure 2 is a schematic cross section, taken on the line 2 2 of Figure 1,of an absorber element of the system of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a cross section of an alternative form of solar absorber element for use with the absorption system of Figure 1. Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a water heating system lO which directly absorbs solar radiation to heat water for a swimming pool. Additionally, heat is absorbed from the roof surface by way of conduction. The system 10 includes one or more solar radiation panels 11 which are formed of an extruded plastics material. Each element 11 has a plurality of longitudinally extending passages 15, preferably four, through which water passes to be heated by the element 11. The element 11 has its passages 15 in communication with an inlet manifold 12 and an outlet manifold 13A or 13B. In Figure 1 there are to systems schematically depicted, one includes at least to elements 11 joined by loop conduits 14. In that particular cmbodiment, the inlet and outlet manifolds may be located ii a lower gutter while the other system has the outlet manifold 13A located, for example, underneath the roof capping. Now with particular reference to Figure 2, the crosssection of the element 11 shows that it consists of a plurality of generally circular conduits 18 which define passages 15. The conduits 18 are joined by webs 16 which are formed integral with the conduits 18 and extend generally tangential thereto. Additionally, the webs 16 have flat surfaces 19 which are provided to abut the roof surface so as to receive heat therefrom by conduction.The webs 16 are provided with longitudinally extending grooves 17 which provide the elements 11 with a certain amount of flexibility, thereby facilitating its easy instalment. Now with particular reference to Figure 3, the element 20 may be used to replace the element 11 in the systems of Figure 1. The element 20 includes a plurality of generally circular conduits 21 which define passages 25.The conduits 21 are joined by webs 22 consisting of to inclined parts 23 and 24. It should be appreciated that the inclined parts 23 and 24 are constructed so as to not cast a shadow over the passages 21. hlore particularly, the inclined parts 23 and 24 extend along tangents extending between adjacent passages 21. Additionally, flat surfaces 26 are provided to improve contact with the roof. It should be appreciated that the centre lines of the conduits 18 lie within a common plane, while the surfaces 19 lie in a different plane parallel to the plane of the centre lines of the conduits 18. The same relationship exists for the conduits 21 and surfaces 22.
