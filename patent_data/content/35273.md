# Method for selective denitration of tobacco.

## Abstract
A process for treating tobacco to reduce the delivery of various gas phase components, during combustion of tobacco products is disclosed. The process comprises contacting tobacco material with an aqueous solution to form a tobacco extract. After separating the extract from the fibrous tobacco portion, the extract is treated by an ionic extraction means such that nitrate ions are extracted while the potassium ion content of the extract is left sub stantially intact. The treated extract may then be recom bined with the fibrous tobacco products. Such products exhibit reduced delivery of nitrogen oxides, HCN and CO during combustion.
