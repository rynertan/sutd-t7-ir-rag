## Description
The present invention relates generally to a change speed gearing assembly for motor vehicles, and more particularly to a lubrication arrangement in the change speed gearing assembly. US A 4 359 909 describes a change speed gearing assembly comprising a casing formed with an upright partition wall, a pair of bearings carried on the upper and lower portions of the partition wall respectively for rotatably supporting thereon upper and lower shafts, and a bearing retainer secured in a fluid tight manner to the outside face of the partition wall to retain both the bearings in place. The bearing retainer is formed therein with upper and lower cavities, in which the outside portions of the bearings are exposed respectively, and is formed with a vertical groove for communication between the upper and lower cavities. The upper shaft extends outwardly through an annular oil seal member carried on the bearing retainer coaxially with the upper bearing and exposed at its inside face to the interior of the upper cavity. In operation of the change speed gearing assembly, an amount of lubricating oil stored in the casing is picked up by rotation of gears mounted on the shafts and in mesh with each other. A portion of the picked up lubricating oil is fed into the upper cavity to lubricate the oil seal member and the upper bearing and returns into the casing across that bearing. The remaining portion of the lubricating oil flows into the lower cavity through the vertical groove to lubricate the lower bearing and returns into the casing across that bearing. In such a lubricating arrangement in the change speed gearing assembly, the vertical groove is positioned on a vertical line between the upper and lower shafts. For this reason, in the case that the quantity of lubricating oil fed into the upper annular cavity becomes small during low speed rotation of the gears, lubrication of the oil seal member will be insufficient because the vertical groove permits therethrough a flow of lubricating oil into the lower cavity. This causes fatigue of the oil seal member in a short period of time, resulting in leakage of the oil across the seal member. It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide a lubrication arrangement in the change speed gearing assembly capable of effecting sufficient lubrication of the oil seal member during low speed rotation of the gears to enhance durability of the seal member. According to the present invention, there is provided a lubrication arrangement in the above described change speed gearing assembly, wherein the bottom portion of the upper cavity is separated from the upper portion of the lower cavity, and wherein the vertical groove is formed at one side of the bearing retainer and opens at its upper end into a side portion of the upper cavity located substantially at the same level as the axis of said input shaft and at its lower and into the upper portion of the lower cavity and the upper bearing is a sealed bearing. In operation of the change speed gearing assembly, the level of lubricating oil fed into the upper cavity is constantly maintained above the lower edge of the annular sealing lip of the seal member to effect sufficient lubrication of the seal member during low speed rotation of the gears. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a portion of a change speed gearing assembly for motor vehicles which includes a casing 11 formed with an upright partition wall 11b and arranged to store an amount of lubricating oil therein, and a bearing retainer 12 secured in a fluid tight manner to the outside face of partition wall 11b. Arranged within the casing 11 is an upper shaft in the form of an input shaft 21 which is supported by an upper sealed ball bearing 13 carried on the upper portion of partition wall 11b. An output shaft 23 is connected at its one end to the inner end of input shaft 21 for relative rotation therewith and is provided thereon with a synchronizer 24. A lower shaft in the form of a countershaft 22 is arranged in parallel with the input shaft 21 and supported at its one end by a lower roller bearing 14 carried on the lower portion of partition wall 11b. The input shaft 21 is integrally formed at its inner end with an input gear 21a, and the countershaft 22 is integrally formed with a counter gear 22a which is in meshing engagement with the input gear 21a at a position closely adjacent the inside face of partition wall 11b. The input and counter gears 21a and 22a act to pick up the lubricating oil in casing 11. As can be well seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the bearing retainer 12 has a tubular extension 12a arranged coaxlally with the upper ball beating 13 and is formed with an annular recess 12c at the inner end of an axial bore 12b in tubular extension 12a. An annular oil seal member 15 is coupled within the annular recess 12c with a press fit, and the input shaft 21 extends outwardly from the tubular extension 12a through an annular lip portion 15a of seal member 15 to be operatively connected in a usual manner to a prime mover of the vehicle through a frictional clutch not shown . In such arrangement the bearing retainer 12 is in abutment with respective outer races of the bearings 13 and 14 to retain them in place. As is illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3, the boaring retainer 12 is formed at its upper portion with an upper annular cavity 12d of large diameter which cooperates with the outside face of upper sealed ball bearing 13 to form an upper annular lubrication chamber R₁ around the input shaft 21 between the upper boaring 13 and the oil seal member 15. Thus, the oil seal member 15 is exposed to the upper annular lubrication chamber R₁. The bearing retainer 12 is further formed at its lower portion with a lower circular cavity 12e of small diameter which cooperates with the outside face of lower roller bearing 14 to form a lower lubrication chamber R₂. As can be well seen in Fig. 3, the upright partition wall 11b is provided therethrough with an axial hole 11a which opens at its inner end toward the interior of casing 11 and at its outer end into a radial recess 12f formed in the upper portion of bearing retainer 12 and located above the upper annular cavity 12d. The upright partition wall 11b is further formed at its inside face with an oil receiver which extends around the lower and side edges of the inner end opening of axial hole 11a to receive the lubricating oil picked up by rotation of the gears 21a, 22a and introduce it into the axial hole 11a Thus, the radial recess 12f cooperates with the outside face of partition wall 11b to form an oil feed passage P₁ through which the lubricating oil from axial hole 11a flows into the upper lubrication chamber R₁. In this embodiment, the change speed gearing assembly is characterized in that as can be well seen in Figs. 2 and 3, the bearing retainer 12 is formed at one side thereof with a vertical groove 12g which cooperates with the outside face of partition wall 11b to form a communication passage P₂ between the upper and lower lubrication chambers R₁ and R₂ and that the bearing retainer 12 is formed with an inner end face 12h which is fitted to this outside face of partition wall 11b to separate the bottom portion of upper annular cavity 12d from the upper portion of lower cavity 12e. The vertical groove 12g opens at its upper end 12g₁ into a side portion of the upper annular cavity 12d located substantially at the same level as the axis of input shaft 21 and opens at its lower end 12g₂ into the upper portion of lower cavity 12e. Thus, the upper opening of the communication passage P₂ is located above the lower edge of annular lip portion 15a of seal member 15 to permit a flow of lubricating oil overflowing from the upper lubrication chamber R₁ into the lower lubrication chamber R₂. In operation of the change speed gearing assembly, the lubricating oil in casing 11 is picked up by rotation of the gears 21a, 22a and splashes onto the surrounding parts. A portion of the picked up lubricating oil is received by the oil receiver and flows into the upper lubrication chamber R₁ through the oil feed passage P₁ to lubricate the upper ball bearing 13 and the oil seal member 15. Subsequently, a portion of the lubricating oil overflowing from the upper lubrication chamber R₁ flows into the lower lubrication chamber R₂ through the communication passage P₂ to lubricate the lower roller bearing 14 and returns into the bottoms portion of casing 11 across the bearing 14. In such a condition, the level of oil in the upper lubrication chamber R₁ is constantly maintained above the lower edge of annular lip portion 15a of seal member 15. As a result even if the quantity of lubricating oil fed into passage P₁ becomes small due to low speed rotation of the gears 21a, 22a, the oil seal member 15 is sufficiently lubricated at its lower portion.
