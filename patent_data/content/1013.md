# Glass reinforced rigid PVC.

## Abstract
Rigid thermoplastic sheet materials of which the polymeric constituent is predominantly vinyl chloride polymer, which contain glass fibres lying in, or substantially in, the plane of the sheet the amount of glass fibre being in the range 5 to 30 per cent by weight of the material. A particulate filler is also present in the sheet in an amount in the range 20 to 50 per cent by weight, the amount of the polymeric constituent of the sheet being 30 to 75 per cent by weight. A sheet is made by building up successive very thin layers on a calender roll to ensure that the fibres are lying in the plane of the sheet. Several such sheets are then laminated together under heat and pressure. An extra reinforcing layer of a material such as a cloth, mat or scrim can be incorporated. The resultant rigid sheets are suitable for moulding. If desired decorative surface layers can be laminated onto the sheets and the sheets are then suitable for use, for instance, as wall panelling.

## Description
GLASS REINFORCED RIGID PVCThis invention relates to thermoplastic sheet materials, and more particularly to such materials based on vinyl chloride polymers and containing fibrous reinforcemente Thermoplastic sheet materials containing reinforcing fibres which are uniformly dispersed throughout and all lie in or substantially in the plane of the sheet are described in our UK Patents Numbers 1,068,064 and 1,199,283. However these sheet materials contained only a small proportion of filler, talc being used in the Examples, and the fibre reinforcements contained at least a proportion of asbestos.The physical properties of these sheet materials are excellent and the asbestos fibres are fully wetted out and encapsulated by the polymer so that no health hazard arises during normal use. However, certain applications require the sheet to be cut, drilled, sawn or punched and these postmanufacturing operations can release small amounts of asbestos fibre.The formulations described in the above identified patents contain 30 to 70 by weight of fibre and a much lower proportion of filler, if the latter is present. The process used to make the thermoplastic sheet materials with the fibres lying in the plane of the sheet involves building up the sheet from successive very thin e.g. 0.0004 inch thick layers of the thermoplastic material in order to ensure that the fibres lie as required. In the formulations exemplified in UK Patents Nos. 1,068,064 and 1,199,283 the asbestos cannot be replaced by another mineral fibre such as glass and satisfactory results still obtained by the same process.We have now found, however, that by the use of reduced amounts of fibre with particular proportions of particulate fillers thermoplastic sheet materials can be manufactured containing glass fibres as the sole fibrous reinforcement.According to the present invention a rigid sheet comprises a polymeric constituent formed from a monomer or monomers in which vinyl chloride at least predominates, glass fibres and particulate filler, the amount of glass fibre being in the range 5 to 30 per cent by weight of the material, the amount df filler being in the range 20 to 50 per cent and the amount of polymeric constituent being in the range 30 to 75 per cent, the glass fibres and filler being uniformly dispersed throughout and the glass fibres all lying in, or substantially in, the plane of the sheet.The rigid sheet may conveniently be made by the method described in detail in UK Patent No. 1,068,064 in which the polymeric constituent, in the form of a solution in a volatile organic solvent or of a mixture of a solution in a volatile organic solvent and a dispersion, and the other ingredients are converted into a substantially homogeneous dough like mass. The mass is built up continuously in laminations on a hot calendar roll, the sheet thus formed is cut on the roll, removed and allowed to cool. Several such sheets are then generally laminated together by application of heat and pressure. At this lamination stage an extra reinforcing layer of a different material may be incorporated into the sheet.The polymeric constituent is a material which is rigid at room temperature when unreinforced, and must therefore contain little or no plasticizer.The polymer constituent may be mixture of vinyl chloride homopolymer with a copolymer of vinyl chloride which is soluble in an organic solvent such as a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer or vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride copolymer.Alternatively, if desired, a special soluble vinyl chloride homopolymer of the kind used in our UKPatent Number 1,199,283 may be used, in which case the process for making the sheet may be slightly modified by using a single doughlike mass as described in the latter patent specification.Chlorinated versions of the vinyl chloride polymers mentioned in the two immediately preceding paragraphs may also be used. Chlorinated poly vinyl chloride is prepared by a chlorination reaction on the polymer itself after polymerisation . Thus whilst the usual poly vinyl chloride contains approximately 57 by weight of combined chlorine, a chlorinated version may contain up to 70 per cent by weight of chlorine.In each case, where maximum fire resistance is not required, a minor amount of a latex of a film forming polymer may be incorporated in the dough like mass.Such polymers as acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers, acrylonitrile copolymers, copolymers of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl fumarate, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates and chlorinated polyethylenes, may be added in this way. The total proportion of this polymer is to be kept low, no more than 10 by weight of total polymeric constituent, and its function is primarily to improve the processability of the dough like mass.The glass fibre is conveniently used in the form of chopped strands of length in the range 3 to 6mm and has a surface dressing appropriate to promote adhesion to the polymeric constituent. The preferred amount of glass to use is in the range 8 to 20 by weight of the sheet in order to obtain appreciable reinforcement of the sheet whilst keeping cost down, since glass fibre is a relatively costly ingredient.The function of the particulate filler which is used is to obtain the correct consistency of dough for the sheet to be manufactured without detracting from the fire resistance of the sheet.The preferred amount of filler depends to some extent on the amount of glass fibres used, the ratio by weight of filler to glass fibre being preferably greater than 1 to 1 and more preferably between 1 to 1 and 4 to 1.Examples of suitable fillers are calcium carbonate including limestone and chalk calcium magnesium carbonate including dolomite calcium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesite oxides of aluminium, titanium, zinc, magnesium or antimony certain clays and aluminosilicates including china clay kaolin , calcined clay montmorillonite including bentonite and fullers earth slate powder, and mica comprising muscovite, suzorite and phlogopite borax colemanite silica flour quartz including silica spheres such as those produced from fuel ash kieselguhr talc calcium silicate including wollastonite barytes barium sulphate gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate fluorspar or mixtures of 2 or more of the above mentioned fillers.Minor amounts of other additives or fillers may also be added as well known in the art, including pigments and fillers of low density such as cork or vermiculite which have the effect of lowering the specific gravity of the finished sheet.Unlike the asbestos reinforced sheets produced in the UK Patent 1,068,064 and 1,199,283 the glass fibre reinforced sheets in this invention have anisotropic properties. This may be used to advantage for some purposes, and to obtain more uniform properties sheets may be laminated together with their axes perpendicular or at desired angles. Another way of reducing anisotropy is to add an extra layer of reinforcement at the lamination stage in the form of a cloth, mat or scrim. This may be composed of any suitable type of discontinuous fibres e.g., chopped strand mat or continuous fibres for example a woven cloth or open weave scrim provided that the fibres retain their integrity at the temperature employed in lamination. The fibres may be coated with an appropriate size or bonding agent to promote adhesion to the polymer. Preferably the extra layer of reinforcement is placed between the sheets before they are pressed in the lamination stage.The rigid sheets provided by this invention are suitable for moulding. If desired decorative surface layers can be laminated to the sheets to render them more attractive in appearance and thus suitable for use as, for example, wall panelling. Examples will now be given of the production of rigid sheets reinforced with glass fibres.Examples 1 to 6In examples 1 6 detailed in Tables 1 and 2 4200 gms of a paste making PVC homopolymer commercially available under the trademark Breon P130 1 plus 750 gms of a PVC suspension polymer Breon S110 10 plus 1050 gms of a copolymer of PVC and polyvinyl acetate Corvic R46 88 plus 270 gms of dicyandiamide D.C.D.A. were stirred into 8 kg of toluene.After 20 30 minutes mixing the mixture was added to a spike mixer containing 1500 gms of 6 mm chopped strand glass fibre Owens corning OCF409 in examples 1 4 and TBA Industrial Products Ltd. XGS.1347 in examples 5 and 6 and 6 kg total filler in finely divided form, detailed in Tables 1 and 2. After about 1 hours mixing 1000 gms of a modified acrylonitrile copolymer latex Breon 1577 was added the tables show the dry weight percentage and mixing continued for a further 30 minutes.The dough from this operation was removed to the nip of a calender and built up to a sheet as described in BP 1,068,064.Several of these sheets were laminated together between heated press plates to form a pressed sheet about 3 mm thick. Layers of cellophane were interposed between the outer plies and the press plates to prevent sticking. The sheet was cut into suitable test pieces in both the direction of calendering A direction and perpendicular to it B direction and the test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Examples 7 10In examples 7 10 detailed in Table 3 the glass used was XGS.1347 in all cases the fibres being 6 mm long except where marked otherwise. They were prepared in the same way as examples 1 6 except that in pressing the calendered sheets rigid PVC foils were incorporated to give a product faced both sides with these coloured foils. Properties are shown in Table 3.Examples 11 13These were prepared as in examples 1 6 except that in stacking the dried, calendered sheets for press lamination the various plies were cross plied alternately in a symmetrical way about the centre of the sheet.This resulted in an ABABA type of lay up and rigidPVC foils were applied to the outside surfaces.Formulation details and results of tests on these boards are shown in Table 4.Examples 14 15These were prepared as in Examples 11 13 but no rigid PVC foils were included in the pressed boards.Details of formulations and their properties are shown in Table 5.Example 16To 200 litres of toluene were added 58 kg of a paste making PVC homopolymer commercially available from ICI under the trade mark Corvic P65 50 , plus 14 kg of PVC copolymer Corvic R46 88 being a copolymer of polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate, plus 10 kg of a suspension homopolymerPVC Breon S110 10 available from BP ChemicalsLimited plus 3.8 kg of dicyandiamide stabiliser together with 200 gms of carbon black. The mixture was homogenised to a pumpable fluid in a mixer with a high speed agitator. After 20 minutes the fluid was pumped into a spike mixer containing 50 kg ground dolomite Micromilling Ltd. 28 kg ground linestone flour Grade HN90 ex C.E. Ramsden Co. Ltd. 8 kg granulated cork Grade V 2 5 ex Cork Growers Ltd. 22 kg of 6 mm chopped strand glass fibre. Sold as ECR.1347 by TBA Industrial Products Ltd.which had previously een mixed together by operation of the spike mixer. After adding the PVC solution the spike mixer was run for 40 mins. after which an addition of 7.5 kg of a modified acrylonitrile copolymer latex Breon 1577 available from BP ChemicalsLtd. was added and mixing continued for a further 30 mins.The dough like mass was transferred to the nip of a calender and a laminated sheet was built up to a thickness of 0.75 mm as described in UK 1,068,064.Five of these calendered sheets after drying and trimming to size were stacked in a press betweenPVC rigid coloured foils the outer surfaces of the outer calendered sheets having been treated with a pigment PVC stabilizer system similar to that described in BP 1,068,064 to produce a board 3 mm thick which had the following properties A andB referring to the axes in the plane of the board .

Example 20To 7 kg toluene was added 4400 gms of a chlorinatedPVC suspension polymer having a chlorine content of 65.5 Lucolour RB8065 from Rhone Poulenc and the mixture stirred vigorously for 30 mins. The mix it did not completely dissolve was added to a spike mixer containing 1500 gms 6 mm chopped glass fibre, 2700 gms of pulverised fuel ash and 1200 gms of limestone flour, and mixed for 1 hour. After addition of 600 gms wet weight of Breon 1577 and mixing for a further 30 mins. the dough was calendered into a sheet using a hot bowl temperature of 280 F. After drying and pressing between PVC foils the 3 mm thick board was tested and found to have a tensile strength of 72 MPa in the A direction and 36 MPa in the B direction.
