# Process for the hydrolysis of glycol dialkyl ether to a monoalkyl ether and tertiary alcohol or tertiary olefin.

## Abstract
A process is described for converting glycol dialkyl ether without substantial formation of olefin oligomers by reaction with water, comprising reacting a feed glycol di tertiary alkyl ether represented by structural formula A with water using a strongly acidic cation exchange resin as a catalyst and a reaction temperature of from 40 C to 150 C under a pressure of from 1 to 70 kg cmÂ² absolute pressure in a molar ratio of water feed glycol di tertiary alkyl ether represented by the structural for mula A of from 0.05 1 to 60 1, to convert the ether of formula A into at least one of 1 glycol mono tertiary alkyl ether represented by the structural formula B and tertiary alcohol represented by the structural for mula C , and 2 tertiary olefin represented by the structural formula D wherein A , B , C and D are as follows
