# NUMERICAL CONTROL SYSTEM.

## Abstract
A numerical control system wherein the coordinates X, Y, Z designating the position of the top of a tool and the vectors I, J, K designating the direction of the shaft of the tool are read by a tape reader 102 , a carry data calculating circuit 104 calculates the rectangular coordinates x, y, z expressing the position of the center of rotation of the tool and the spherical coordinates b, c expressing the angular position of the rotation of the tool by using the above values, and the length l of the tool preset by a dial 103 or the like, a pulse distribution circuit 105 converts thus obtained coor dinate values into the amounts of movement in a pulse form in the directions of all the axes, and then the obtained pulse signals drive servo motors 107X to 107C through servo circuits 106X to 106C to drive the tool or work table to a desired working position.
