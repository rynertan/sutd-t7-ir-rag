# IMPROVED ATOMIZER FOR GAS OIL BURNERS

## Abstract
Improved atomizer for gas oil burners, characterized thereby that it mainly consists of an atomizer body 2 wherein, with its top angle ending into the atomizer opening 3 , a conical cavity 6 is provided and wherein in this body 2 a freely rotatable revolving head 10 is provided which is driven by the gas oil, the conical end 17 of the revolving head 10 being held at a very small distance from said cavity 6 so as to form a conical gap through which the gas oil has to pass before it can reach the atomizer opening 3 .
