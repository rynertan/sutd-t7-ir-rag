# Termination for alternate polarity resistance welding cable.

## Abstract
A cable termination assembly for a kickless welding cable of the type comprised of a pair of opposite pola rity mutually insulated lugs each having connected the reto a plurality of conductors which are helically and al ternately wound is characterized by a terminal including a pair of mutually insulated terminal lug elements 16, 18 each having an offset extension 32 with opposed reces sed contact surfaces 34, 36 and cable conductor connec tors 50, 52 secured to the terminal ends of the cable conductors, each connector having a contact surface 58, 68 for engagement with one of the recessed contact surfaces 34, 36 of the terminal lug elements 32 , the relative configurations and orientations of the connectors and terminal elements when fastened together being such that the cable conductors at their terminal ends are sub stantially straight and parallel, and extend in alignment with their respective relative positions in which they are located in the cable adjacent the terminal ends. Thus, the cable conductors of opposite leads are commonly connected to respective terminal elements without ben ding, twisting and or crossover of the conductors, thereby substantially reducing bending strains and reactance for ces in the cable.
