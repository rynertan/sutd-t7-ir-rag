## Description
IMPROVED HERBICIDAL COMPOSITtONS This invention relates to concentrated herbicidal compositions containing a herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary salt as an active ingredient. Following the discovery of the insecticidal properties of DDT and the synthesis of the hormone type weedkillers exemplified by 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, a large range of pesticides has been developed for agricultural use in the control of fungal and insect pests and weeds. While these substances are necessarily toxic to certain forms of life, when used with due care and in accordance with governmentally approved codes of practice, they present no hazard to human life. However, in spite of efforts to encourage those concerned with pesticides to adopt safe handling practices, instances of misuse of pesticides do occur. One particular unsafe practice in the case of liquid pesticides is for an operator to transfer a small amount of the concentrated pesticide to a domestic container such as a beverage bottle for subsequent use at home.The risk attached to this practice is of course that a child or incautious adult coming upon the bottle may swallow the contents with possibly serious consequences. Various proposals have been put forward to reduce the likelihood that solutions of herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary salts might be accidentally swallowed in this way. Thus, it has been proposed in U.K. Patent No. 1406881 to add a mixture of alkyl pyridines pyridine basel to the herbicide solution so that the distinctive odour will act as a warning that the solution is not a beverage. Other odourants have also been proposed. It has also been proposed see U.K. Patent 13955021 to add gelling agents to the herbicide solution to make it thixotropic, so that on standing the solution forms a gel which will not pour easily. It has also been proposed see U.K.Patent 1507407 to add certain triazolopyrimidine derivatives to the herbicide solution to provide a composition which will provoke vomiting and consequent expulsion of the composition soon after it has been swallowed. The present invention provides a further or alternative method of reducing the likelihood of accidental swallowing of herbicidal bipyridylium salts in the circumstances referred to above, by the inclusion in the herbicide solution of an alerting agent com prising a bittering agent Ci.e. a substance having an intensely bitter flavour , which acts as a warning that the solution is not a beverage if any of the solution is taken into the mouth. Accordingly the present invention provides a concentrated herbicidal composition comprising an aqueous solution of a herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary cation, which contains an alerting agent comprising a quaternary salt of the formula I or II below EMI2.1 EMI3.1 wherein R1 represents benzyl or chlorobenzyl R and R3 each represent alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms 4. R is phenyl or substituted phenyl or a carboxy substituted aliphatic group and R5 is a phenylene group, a substituted phenylene group, an alkylene group, a subs tituted alkylene group, or a single chemical bond. A preferred alerting agent is benzyl diethyl 2,6 xylylcarbamoyl methyl ammonium benzoate which has the approved common name denatonium benzoate.Preferably the alerting agent is present in a concentration of from 1 to 10 parts per million of the herbicidal composition that is to say from 0.001 grams to 0.01 grams per litre of the composition. A description of the preparation of the alerting agents is given in U.S. Patent No. 3080327. The odourants, gelling agents, and s triazolopyrimidine emetic agents, described in U.K. Patents 1406881, 1395502, and 1507407 respectively, may also be added to the compositions. Preferably the composition also comprises a surface active agent. Preferred salts of herbicidal bipyridylium cations for use in the compositions of the invention are those of the following formulae EMI4.1 wherein R and RÃš,which may be the same or different, stand for alkyl radicals of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted by hydroxy, halogen, carboxyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylcarbonyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl or N lower alkyl substituted carbamoyl CXS n represents an anion and n is an integer from 1 to 4 inclusive. By lower alkoxy, alkoxycarbamoyl, alkylcarbonyl or alkyl, we mean radicals containing an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred salts of herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary cations are those listed below 1,1 ethylene 2, 2 bipyridylium dibromide diquat di bromide 1, l dimethyl 4, 4 bipyridylium dichloride paraquat dichloride 1, l di 2 hydroxyethyl 4, 4 bipyridylium dichloride 1 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 4,4 bipyridylium dichloride 1,1 di carbamoylmethyl 4 , 4 bipyridylium dichloride 1,1 bis N,N dimethylcarbamoylmethyl 4,4 bipyridylium chloride 1,1 bis N,N diethylcarbamoylmethyl 4,4 bipyridylium dichloride 1,1 diacetonyl 4, 4, bipyridylium chloride 1,1 diethoxycarbonylmethyl 4 , 4 bipyridylium dibromide 1, 1 diallyl 4, 4 bipyridylium dibromide. The names in brackets alongside some of the compounds in the above list are the accepted common names for the cationic portion of these compounds.Thus paraquat is the common name for the 1,1 dimethyl 4,4 bipyridylium cation. Paraquat is a particularly preferred bipyridylium cation for use in the compositions of the invention. Since the herbicidal effect of a bipyridylium quaternary cation is independent of the nature of the associated anion, the choice of the anion is a matter of convenience, depending, for example, on cost.Preferably the anion is one which gives rise to a salt of convenient water solubility. Examples of anions, which may be mono or poly valent, include bromide, chloride, methylsulphate and sulphate. The salt of the herbicidal bipyridylium cation may be formed from a number of similar anions or mixtures of different ones. A salt having any particular desired anion may be prepared either by direct synthesis from reactants which include the desired anion, or by exchanging the anion of a previously prepared salt for the preferred anion by methods well known in the art, for example by passage of a solution of the previously prepared salt through an ion exchange resin. For reasons of convenience and economy, the chloride anion is a particularly preferred anion. Since the characteristic herbicidal activity of a salt of a herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary cation resides in the cation only, it is customary to quote concentrations of active ingredient and rates of application in terms of the amount of bipyridylium quaternary cation used, thus avoiding the inconvenience of having to quote different application rates for different salts of the same bipyridylium quaternary cation.Application rates and concentrations quoted in this specification therefore relate to the amount of herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary cation unless otherwise stated. The amount of herbicidal bipyridylium quaternary cation present in the compositions of the invention is preferably from 0.5 to 3.0 pounds per Imperial gallon 50 grams to 300 grams per litre and more preferably from 1.0 to 2.5 pounds per Imperial gallon C100 grams to 250 grams per litre . Surface active agents may be cationic, non ionic or anionic. Generally speaking cationic and non ionic surface active.agents are preferred to anionic surfaceactive agents for use in the compositions of the invention, since the latter may interact undesirably with. the bipyridylium quaternary salt in the composition.Examples of non ionic surface active agents for use in the compositions of the invention include the condensation products of ethylene oxide with alkyl phenols such as octylphenol, nonylphenol and octylcresol.Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monolaurate the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide and the lecithins. The amount of surface active agent present in the composition is preferably from 20 to 100 grams per litre of the composition. Examples of cationic surface agents include quaternary salts, for example the substances sold under the Trade Mark Arquad and Duoquod .
