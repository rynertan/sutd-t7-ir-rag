## Description
Immobilized Enzyme PreParation This invention relates to an immobilised enzyme preparation, a process for the production of such a preparation and the use of such a preparation in an enzyme catalysed reaction. Enzymes are proteins which catalyse chemical reactions.However their utility for various applications has been limited since it is difficult to separate enzymes from reaction media, thus limiting product purity. Moreover soluble enzymes may generally be used only once in a batch reaction and, because of the high costs of many enzymes, their industrial use has been limited, even though they are extremely efficient catalysts. In the past decade much research effort has been devoted to devising techniques for immobilizing enzymes by attaching or bonding them to water insoluble carrier materials in such a way that the enzymes are rendered immobile yet remain catalytically active. Known immobilised enzyme preparations have several disadvantages, for example some when packed into a column exhibit unsatisfactory flow properties or low enzyme yields or decreased stability.Thus an increasing need exists to develop improved immobilized enzyme preparations. Our co pending UK Application No. 32398t 7 corresponding to Belgian Pat. 869317 describes an improved immobilized enzyme preparation comprising a support material, the surface of which carries hydrophobic groups, and having molecules of at least one enzyme attached to the hydrophobic gro3ps. Whilst, in this enzyme preparation, the support material may be in any suitable physical form, we have found that particulate materials prepared in a specify manner give improved results. In our UK Specifications Nos. 1,373,531 1,403,794 1,419,199 1,453,713 1,506,221 1,506,222 and our UK Application No. 19487 76 which corresponds to US Serial No. 795307 andGerman OLS 2721501 we describe a number of variants of a process hereinafter referred to as the dispersion preparation process for the preparation of a stable dispersion in a hydrocarbon liquid of, inter alia, a polyamide which is insoluble in that liquid, by thermal polymerisation in the hydrocarbon liquid of one or more polyaside forming reactants, at least one of said reactants being insoluble in the hydrocarbon liquid at the polymerisation temperature, the process comprising the steps of 1 bringing said insoluble reactant or reactants into the state of a stable dispersion of finely divided particles in the hydrocarbon liquid with the aid of a dispersing agent which is soluble in the hydrocarbon and which incorporates in the molecule a a polymeric component which is solvatable by the hydrocarbon and b a grouping which is capable of becoming associated with the particles of the insoluble reactant s , 2 heating the dispersion of the insoluble reactant s , together with any other necessary reactants which are soluble in the hydrocarbon liquid, to the polymerisation temperature in the presence of a polymer stabilizing agent which is soluble in the bydro carbon and incorporates in the molecule i a polymeric component which is solvatable by the hydrocarbon and ii a grouping which is capable of becoming associated with the particles of the resulting polyamide as that polymer is formed. The dispersion preparation process is also described in Dispersion polymerisation in organic media , Editor K E J Barrett,Published by J Wiley. According to the present invention we provide an immobilized enzyme preparation in which molecules of at least one enzyme are attached to amino groups on the surface of a particulate support material wherein the support material comprises particles which have amino groups on their surfaces and which have been separated from a dispersion produced by a dispersion preparation process as hereinbefore defined . Further according to the invention we provide a process for the production of an immobilized enzyme preparation which comprises the steps of 1 producing a stable dispersion of particles having amino groups on their surfaces by a dispersion preparation process as hereinbefore defined . 2 separating the particles from the dispersion, and 3 contacting the particles with at least one enzyme for such a time and under such conditions that enzyme molecules become attached to amino groups on the surfaces of the particles. Purther according to the invention we provide a process for performing an enzyme catalysed reaction wherein the enzyme is in the form of an immobilized enzyme preparation in which molecules of at least one enzyme are attached to amino groups on the surface of a particulate support material, the support material comprising particles which have amino groups on their surfaces and which have been separated from a dispersion produced by a dispersion preparation process as hereinbefore defined . Variants of the dispersion preparation process which can be used to prepare the dispersion include the following a A variant wherein the insoluble reactant is liquifiable at temperatures below the polymerisation temperature, in which case step 1 of the dispersion preparation process produces an emulsion of liquid reactant particles in the hydrocarbon UK SpecificationNo. 1,373,531 . b A variant wherein the insoluble reactant is solid at the polymerisation temperature, in which case step 1 of the dispersion preparation process produces a dispersion of solid reactant particles in the hydrocarbon E Specification No. 1,403,794 . c A variant wherein the insoluble reactant, which can be either a3 in a or as in b above, is soluble in a second, inert, liquid which is immiscible with the hydrocarbon and can be separated therefrom by distillation, the resulting solution then being emulsified in the hydrocarbon analogous to a above UK Specification No. 1,419,199 . d A variant wherein a single dispersing and or polymerstabilizing agent is used in both steps 1 and 2 of the dispersion preparation process above patent references . e A variant wherein two insoluble solid reactants are treated together as in b above to give a dispersion of a co polymer UK Specification No. 1,506, 221 . f A variant wherein a solid, inert modifier is co dispersed with the insoluble, solid reactant s in step 1 of the dispersion preparation process performed as in b or e above, to give corn posite disperse particles UK Specification No. 1,506,222 . g A variant wherein a solid inert modifier is introduced into the emulsified insoluble reactant s in step 1 of the dispersion preparation process performed as in a or c above, to give composite disperse particles mC Specification No. 1,453,713 . h In a modification of either variant a or variant c , instead of using a pre fc ed dispersant stabiliser, this may be formed in situ during the polymerisation from a suitable polymeric precursor supplying the solvatable component on to which some of the polymerizing reacta at e become grafted UK Appln. No. 19487 76 . Preferably the polyamideforming reactants are 6 amino caproic acid, nylon 66 salt or 11 amino undecanoic acid, the preferred polyamides being homopolymers or co polymers of these with other materials, ir, particular diathylene triamine. A particularly suitable polymer is one formed from nylon 66 salt and diethylene triamine. The particles used in the support material may be formed entirely from polyamide polymere and co polymers but are preferably modified particles comparing an inert inorganic filler encapsulated in a polyamide polymer or co polymer. Suitable fillers include sand and particles of glass, magnetits and titanium dioxide and impart to the particles of the immobilized enzyme preparation a suitable density. The filled particles are produced in dispersion by the dispersion preparation process es described in f or g above. Dispersing agents and polymer stabilising agents used in , dispersion preparation process may be any of those which satisfy tr,e requirements set out in steps 1 and 2 of the process respect lively as defined above. It is preferred to use a single agent which can perform both functions, and a particularly suitable such agent is a graft oo pymer one polymer component of which is derived from poly 12 hydroxystearic acid and is per se soluble in the hydrocarbon liquid, and another polymeric component of which is an acrylic polymer chain which is capable of becoming associated with the particles of the insoluble reactant s and in turn with the resulting polyamide as it is formed.The hydrocarbon used is preferably an aliphatic 0 hydrocarbon boiling within the range 150 300 C, preferably 180 250 C. In step 1 of the dispersion preparation process, the polyamide forming reactants are brought into an emulsified liquid state or are dispersed by a grinding or milling procedure such as ball milling , in the hydrocarbon liquid in the presence of the dispersing agent, preferably until the mean particle size of reactant is within the range 5 200 p, especially 10 50 . Very suitably in step 1 an additional polyfunctional amino compound is included with the reactants. This gives added amino groups in the final polymer and also facilitates the performance of step 2 .The additional amino compound preferably has at least three groups reactive in the polyamide forming process, tris aminomethgrl propane and, especially, diethylene triamine being examples of suitable compounds for this purpose. Ln step 2 of the dispersion preparation process, the dispersion of insoluble reactants is heated to the polymerisation temperature in the particular case. Generally speaking this tempers ature will be between 150 and 300 C. If a filler is present a composite particle comprising the filler with a polymer or co polymer coating will result. By suitable operation of the dispersion preparation process a stable dispersion is formed of particles of regular shape and having a size and density suitable fo the particular use to which the immobilized enzyme preparation is to be put, i.e. particular enzyme reaction and mode of operation thereof e.g. fluidized bed, column etc. The particles are then separated from the dispersion liquid e.g. by filtration or centrifuging, and are then washed with any suitable solvent, e.g. a xylene toluene mixture in order to remove high boiling hydrocarbon, which is preferably followed by further treatment, e.g. washing with an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, so as to facilitate working in an aqueous medium, before being contacted with the enzyme. To enable an enzyme to be attached to the particulate support material, the material is treated with a compound which a modifies amino groups on its surface or b with a bifunctional compound which is capable of reacting with said amino groups and also with the enzyme. With regard to b , examples of suitable bifunctional compounds include glutaraldehyde and isocyanates.Regarding a , the amino groups may be converted into, e.g. their bromoacetal or diazonium derivatives, using suitable reagents, the material having these modified functional groups is then contacted with an enzyme. To a suspension of treated particulate support material in an aqueous medium can be added an aqueous solution of the enzyme to be immobilized. Molecules of the enzyme attach themselves to support particles to give the immobilized enzyme preparation which is then separated from the suspension, e.g. by filtration. The immobilized enzyme preparation may be used in any suitable manner, for example in fluidized beds or in columns, when acting as the catalyst in the enzyme catalysed reaction. Enzymes which can usefully be immobilized include lactase, glucose isomerase and amylo glucosidase glucoamylase . Enzyme catalysed reactions include the following conversions Lactose to glucose and galactose Glucose to fructose Starch to flucose and other enzymic reactions referred in our UK Specification No.1,497,888. The conversion of glucose to fructose can be carried out as described in our UK Specifications Nos. 1,451,273, 1,492,258 and 1,497,888. The conversior. of lactone to glucose and galactose can be carried out as described in our w Specification No. 1,531,303.
