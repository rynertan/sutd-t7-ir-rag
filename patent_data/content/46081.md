# Process for the production of high molecular weight oxymethylene copolymer in the presence of impurity.

## Abstract
A process for the production of high molecular weight oxymethylene copolymer in the presence of impurity is provided. The process provides a high molecular weight oxymethylene copolymer having a predetermined com onomer content. The process comprises the steps of deter mining the optimal catalyst concentration in a first oxy methylene copolymerization system which contains less than approximately 10 p.p.m impurity determining the concentration of impurity containing at least one active proton in a second copolymerization system adjusting the catalyst concentration in the second copolymerization sys tem so that the total concentration of catalyst and impurity in the second copolymerization system is maintained at the optimal concentration of catalyst in the first copolymeriza tion system and adjusting the concentration of comonomer in the second copolymerization system so as to maintain the pre determined comonomer content in the oxymethylene copolymer product.
