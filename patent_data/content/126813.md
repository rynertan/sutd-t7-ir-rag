SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There are prepared compounds of the formulaeEMI2.1 where R is lower alkyl, e.g. of 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, or butyl or halogen of atomic weight 35 to 80, i.e. chlorine or bromine. The compound erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3nonyl 4 amino imidazole 5 carboxamide NPT 15459 is useful in producing NPT 15392 and its homologues of formula 1 above are useful in making the corresponding homologues of NPT 15392. In addition to being useful in making NPT 15392 and its homologues, NPT 15459 and its homologues are useful in preparing novel analogues of NPT 15392 and its homologues which contain various functional groups in the 2 position of the purine ring, e.g. the compounds of formulae 2 and 3 . Such derivatives would be difficult to prepare without the aid ofNPT 15359 and its homologues. The compounds of formulae 1 , 2 , and 3 also have immunomodulating or inumunopotentiating activity. An immunopotentiator or immunomodulator is any agent which either restores depressed immune function, or enhances normal immune function, or both. Immune function is defined as the development and expression of humoral antibody mediated immunity, cellular thymocyte mediated immunity, or macrophage and ganulocyte mediated resistance.It logically includes agents acting directly on the cells involved i the expression of immune response, or on cellular o molecular mechanisms which, in turn, act to modify the function of cells involved in immune response. Augmentation of immune function may result from the action of an agent to abrogate suppressive mechanisms derived by negative feedback influences endogenous or exogenous to the itnune system. Thus, immune potentiators have diverse mechanisms of action. Despite the diversi ty of cell site of action and biochemical mechanism of action of immunopotentiators, their applications are essentially the same that is, to enhance host resistance.Applications of Immunopotentiators 1 The principal protective function of the immune system relates to resistance to invasion by pathogens, including viruses, rickettsia, mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, and parasites of all types.Thus, improvement of immune response, particularly when depressed, would calculatedly improve resistance in infection or infestation by any of the above pathogens. An immunopotentiator alone or in combination with anti infective therapy can be aprtied to any and all infectious diseases. 2 A second protective function of the immune system is thought to be resistance to engraftment of foreign tissue, either natural as in the fetal maternal relationship or unnatural as performed by the transplant physician. In nunopo tentiators can also be used to facilitate rejection of fetal or placental tissues or to modify or induce tolerance to grafts. 3 A third protective function of the immune system is thought to be resistance to malignant cell development as in cancer. The use of immunopotentiators can be used in cancer treatment to enhance tumor rejection and to inhibit tumor recurrences followling other forms of therapy. 4 A fourth protective function involves the capacity to recognize foreignness and to maintain nonreactivity to self by positive suppressor mechanisms. In auto immune and related disorders, immune reactivity directed at self antigens or exaggerated, elevated responses are apparent which are self destructive. Immunopotentiators can be used to restore normal suppressor mechanisms, induce tolerance, or otherwise promote a nonr,al immune response. Each of the protective functions of the immune system can be modified by non specific therapy with immunopotentiators alone or in combi nation with other agents employed to improve resistance or to kill the invading pathogen. In addition, specific resistance can be augmented by use of immunopotentiators in conjunction with soe form of antigen as in a vaccine employing, for example, virus, tumor cells, etc. This use can be to induce either specific immunity or tolerance. The latter might be exe.plitied by use with antigen in allergy or auto inunune diseases. Use of immuno potentiators may be either therapeutic or propyl lactic the latter particularly in aging, where infection, auto immunity, and cancer are more common. The timing of administration and routes are variable and may be critical in determining whether a positive or negative response results.Any agent capable of augmenting immune response may inhibit it depending on timing and dose thus, under certain circumstances an immunopotentiator could be used as an immunosuppressive agent for use in allergy, auto immunity and transplantation. Various procedures for determining immunomodulating activity are shown in Simon E.P.O.published application 0036077, Illustrative of compounds within the invention in addition to NPT 15459 are erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3 amyl 4 amino imidazole 5 carboxamide, erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3 hexyl 4 aminoimidazole 5 carboxamide, erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3 heptyl 4 aminoimidazole 5 carbozamide, erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3 octyl 4 amino imidazole 5 carboxamide, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 2 aminohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydrox 3 arnyl 2 ,nino hypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 hexyl 2 aminohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 heptyl 2 aminohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 octyl 2 aminohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 2 chloro hypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 amyl 2 chloro hypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 hexyl 2 chioro hypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 heptyl 2 chlorohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 octyl 2 chlorohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 2 bromohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 amyl 2 bromohypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 2 methyl hypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 amyl 2 methylhypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 hexyl 2 methylhypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 heptyl 2 methylhypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 octyl 2 methylhypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 2 ethyl hypoxanthine, erythro 9 2 hydorxy 3 hexyl 2 ethyl hypoxanthine, and erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 amyl 2 ethyl hypoxanthine. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is the IR spectrum of NPT 15459, and Figure 2 is the UV spectrum of NPT 15459 DETAILED DESCRIPTION The synthesis of NPT 15459 is carried out according to the scheme presented below EMI8.1 The other compounds within formula 1 can be prepared in the same manner by replacing erythro 3 amino 2 nonanol by the corresponding aminoalcohol, e.g. erythro 3 amino 2 pentanol and erythro 3 amino 2 octanol. In place of ethyl orthoformate there can be used other lower alkyl orthoformates, e.g. methyl orthoformate, propyl orthoformate and butyl orthoformate. Example 1Synthesis of Erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 4amino imidazole 5 carboxamide NPT 95459 V For improved yield, reactions 1 and 2 above are carried out sequentially without isolation of the intermediate product III. 2 amino 2 cyano acetamide 1 171 g, 1.71 moles is suspended in 2200 ml of acetonitrile. Orthoformic acid triethyl ester II 334 ml 2.0 moles and 2 ml of pyridine are added to the suspension with stirring. The suspension is heated to reflux temperature, using an oil bath preheated to 100 C. The suspension is held at boiling temperature for 40 to 60 minutes.III is produced in situ. 272.5 g of erythro 3amino 2 nonanol 1V 1.71 moles are then added over a 3 to 5 minute period and boiling is continued for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. The reaction is quickly chilled to room temperature. The erbthro 3 2 droy 3 nonyl 4 amino imidazole NPT 15459 V crystallizes. It is filtered by suction, washed with a small amount of acetonitrile and dried in vacuo at 70 C.Yield 330.4 g, 72E of theoryMelting point after recrystallization from acetonitrile 154 158 C.

In place of ethyl ortho for tate there can be employed the other lower alkyl orthoformates, e.g. the methyl, propyl, and butyl orthoformates. In forming NPT 15392 the acetic anhydride forms the acetate of NPT 15392 and this is then hydrolized with alkali, e.g. sodium hydroxide. In place of an orthoformic acid ester formic acid can also be used. Example 2UTILIZATION OF NPT 15459 TO PRODUCE NPT 15392. Erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl hypoxanthine 415 g of erythro 3 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl 4amino imidazole 5 carboxamide V 1.55 moles are suspended in 385 ml of orthoformic acid triethylester.220 ml of acetic acid anhydride are added with stirring. The suspension that is obtained is heated with stirring up to 100 1050C. An exothermic reaction ensues with liberation of ethanol. The liberated ethanol is separated by distillation. The temperature of the reaction mixture is increased slowly up to 130 14OOC. Stirring is continued for about 3 hours, while the liberated ethanol is continuously separated by distillation. The reaction mixture is concentrated to a viscous syrup, which is stirred into a mixture of 415 ml of 306 aqueous WaOH and 1.68 liter of water. The brown solution is slightly acidified by addition of a solution of 123 ml of acetic acid in 1.5 liter of water. Erythro 9 2 hydroxy 3 nonyl hypoxanthine VI crystallizes, is filtered by suction, washed with water and dried in vacuo at 600C.

By the judicious choice of reagents, it is possible to produce a number of 2 substituted derivatives of NPT 15392 and its homologues that could not be produced by other means.The scheme provided in the following diagram illustrates a number of such examples. EMI14.1 erythro 2 amino g 2 hydroxy 3 nouyl hypoxauthine In the reaction scheme just set forthR1 is the groupEMI15.1 The 2,6 dichloro purine compound in the above scheme can be converted to the 2 chloro hypoxanthine using conventional procedures, e.g. by refluxing with sodium hydroxide in the manner showy in Simon U.S. patent 4,221,909 Method D. The latter compound can then be converted to the corresponding 2 a.ino hypoxanthine by reacting with methanolic an monica in a manner analogous to that shown in Simon U.S, patent 4,221,909 Method B. Compounds of formula 3 where R is methyl can be made by reacting NPT 15459 or its homologues with ethyl orthcacetate rather than ethyl orthoformate. Corpourlds of formula 3 whereR is ethyl can be made in similar manner by reactingNPT 15459 with ethyl orthopropionate. The immunomodulating activity of NPT 15459 was determined.
