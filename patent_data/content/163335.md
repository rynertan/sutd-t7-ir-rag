## Description
Hydrogen fueled gas turbine engineThe present invention relates to gas turbine engines and more particularly, to a hydrogen fueled gas turbine engine wherein water sprays jetted into a combustion chamber are instantly vaporized to steam by igniting hydrogen gas, thereby utilizing the combustion explosion energy of the hydrogen gas and the steam energy generated from the vaporization of the water sprays in combination to obtain mechanical dynamic energy.A wide variety of hydrogen fueled gas turbine engines have hitherto been proposed as a possible replacement for petrol fueled gas turbine engines, primarily for the benefit of less formation of nitrogen oxides NOx and less fuel expenditure. See, for example, U.S. Pat.No. 3,101,592 issued on August 27, 1963 to Anthony E.Robertson et al., wherein a hydrogen gas jet nozzle and a water spray jet nozzle are provided to jet hydrogen gas and water sprays directly into a combustion chamber to generate superheated steam which is passed for use in driving a heat engine. In this arrangement, however, spray pressure of the hydrogen gas is likely to disturb effective jetting in of the water sprays in the combustion chamber. As a consequence, particle of each of the water sprays is not finely divided and thus, sufficient steam energy is not generated to obtain mechanical dynamic energy in combination with the combustion explosion energy of the hydrogen gas.The present invention as claimed herein is intended to eliminate the foregoing drawback and has for its object to provide a hydrogen fueled gas turbine engine which enables sufficiently converting the combustion explosion energy of hydrogen gas into mechanical dynamic energy in combination with the steam energy generated from the vaporization of water sprays.In order to achieve the foregoing object, according to the present invention, a semi spherical member is coaxially supported in an inner housing so as to define therewithin a combustion zone and a mixing zone. Further, a hydrogen gas jet nozzle is provided at the inner housing whereas a water spray jet nozzle is provided at the semi spherical member. With this arrangement, hydrogen gas and water sprays are independently introduced into the combustion zone and the mixing zone Accordingly, introduction of the water sprays from the water spray jet nozzle is not disturbed by spray pressure of the hydrogen gas.Also, according to the present invention, a multiplicity of deflected guide fins are respectively provided at the inner peripheral surfaces of the inner housing and and the semi spherical member. With this arrangement, compressed air is admitted in a spiral fashion into the combustion zone, thereby increasing the substantial combustion area of the hydrogen gas in the combustion zone and increasing its inflammability. Further, combustion gas is admitted in a spiral fashion into the mixing zone, thereby efficiently diffusing the water sprays and producing sufficient steam energy.These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a sectional view of a hydrogen fueled gas turbine engine according to one embodiment of the invention FIGURE 2 is a front view showing an inner housing andFIGURE 3 is a sectional view taken along the line Ill Ill of FIGURE 1.Referring now to the drawings, particularly to FIGURE 1, there is shown a hydrogen fueled gas turbine engine 1 including an outer housing 2 into which compressed air compressed by an air compressor 3 is introduced via an inlet port 4. Supported in the interior of the outer housing 2 is a coaxially spaced inner housing 5. This inner housing 5 is provided at its closed end with a hydrogen gas jet nozzle 6 for supplying hydrogen gas 7 thereto. Formed at the peripheral surface of the inner housing 5 are a multiplicity of circumferentially equispaced apertures 8 see FIGURE 2 through which the compressed air is introduced into the interior of the inner housing 5. In addition, a multiplicity of deflected guide fins 9 see FIGURE 3 project radially inwardly from the inner peripheral surface of the inner housing 5 in close proximity of the corresponding apertures 8 so as to admit the compressed air in a spiral fashion into the interior of the inner housing 5.A semi spherical member 10 is coaxially supported in the inner housing 5 so as to define therewithin a combustion zone 11 unstream thereof and a mixing zone 12 downstream of the combustion zone 11 as shown in FIGURE 1. A water spray jet nozzle 13 is fixedly mounted to the apex of the semi spherical member 10 to jet water sprays 14 into the mixing zone 12. In addition, a circumferentially equispaced apertures 15 are formed at the peripheral surface of the semi spherical member 10 and a multiplicity of deflected guide fins 16 project radially inwardly from the inner peripheral surface of the semi spherical member 10 in close proximity of the corresponding apertures 15.At least one ignition plug 17 is disposed at the peripheral wall of the inner housing 5 to ignite the hydrogen gas 7 jetted into the combustion zone 11.In operation, air is supplied to the air compressor 3 for compressing purposes. The compressed air from the air compressor 3 is first introduced through the inlet port 4 into the interior of the outer housing 2 in such a direction as shown by the arrows in FIGURE 1 and is, then, introduced into the combustion zone 11 through the apertures 8 of the inner housing 5.At this time, the compressed air flows in a spiral fashion into the combustion zone 11 under the influence of the deflected guide fins 9 thereby to form a negative pressure zone substantially at the central portion of the combustion zone 11.Under these conditions, the hydrogen gas 7 and the water sprays 14 are substantially simultaneously jetted respectively into the combustion zone 11 and the mixing zone 12 by the hydrogen gas jet nozzle 6 and the water spray jet nozzle 13. Upon ignition of the ignition plug 17, the hydrogen gas 7 is continuously combusted therein, thereby generating the combustion explosion energy. It will now be appreciated that under the influence of the above mentioned negative pressure zone centrally formed in the combustion zone 11, the hydrogen gas 7 jetted therein is well diffused in the combustion zone 11 and such combustion of the hydrogen gas 7 is thus effectively carried out therein, thereby increasing the combustion area of the hydrogen gas 1. The combustion gas thus generated in the combustion zone 11 is then introduced through the apertures 15 into the mixing zone 12. Hereby, the water sprays 14 sprayed thereinto by the water spray jet nozzle 13 are instantly vaporized to steam for the generation of steam energy. It will also be appreciated that the combustion gas is admitted through the apertures 15 of the semi spherical member 10 into the mixing zone 12 in a spiral fashion under the influence of the deflected guide fins 16 and thus, the water sprays 14 are well diffused in the mixing zone 12, thereby increasing the generation area of the steam energy. As is clear from the foregoing description, mechanical dynamic energy is effectively obtained from the combustion explosion energy of the hydrogen gas 7 in combination with the steam energy generated from the vaporization of the water sprays 14. It will be noted that the combustion gas is next supplied through an outlet port 18 into an output turbine 19 in such a direction as shown by the arrows in FIGURE 1.
