# Process for producing styrene polymer beads of preferred bead size.

## Abstract
Styrenic polymer beads of a preferred size are pro duced from styrenic polymer beads of a smaller size by forming an aqueous suspension of the styrenic polymer beads with the aid of a finely divided, difficultly water solu ble, inorganic phosphate suspending agent and a modifier therefor, and adding thereto, under polymerization condi tions, an aqueous emulsion formed by admixing styrenic monomer and a catalyst therefor with water containing a nonionic surfactant that is an ethylene oxide condensate of an alkylphenol, which contains at least fifty moles of ethy lane oxide per mole of alkylphenol. The beads of preferred size are formed without formation of fine styrenic polymer particles and without significant amounts of clusters of beads.
