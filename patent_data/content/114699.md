# SILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL FOR PHOTOMECHANICAL PROCESS AND METHOD FOR REDUCTION PROCESSING THE SAME

## Abstract
A silver halide photographic material for a photomecha nical process is disclosed. The material comprises a support having provided thereon at least one light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at least one light insensitive upper layer disposed on the upper side of the emulsion layer. The light insensitive upper layer has a greater melting time than the light sensitive emulsion layer. The emulsion layer con tains starch, modified starch and or macromolecular poly saccharides produced from starch using a microbial fermen tation process. The material allows highly efficient reduction proces sing.
