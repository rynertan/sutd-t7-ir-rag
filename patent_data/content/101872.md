# Duplex optical communication module device.

## Abstract
A duplex optical communication module unit is dis closed, which comprises a ceramic substrate 24 and first and second metal shells 38, 42 having respective transpa rent window members 36, 40 and hermetically bonded to the ceramic substrate 24 so as to define a first and second space 44, 46 , respectively. A light emitting element 48 is assembled in the first space 44 , and a light emitting element 54 and a circuit element 56 for amplifying the photo current from the light emitting element 54 are assembled in the second space 46 . Metallization layers 88, 96 are formed on the ceramic substrate 24 over a substantial area thereof, light receiving and light transmitting sections being shielded by the metallization layers and metal shells.
