# Process and apparatus for the recovery of uranium values from an organic extractant phase.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus are described for stripping uranium values from a uranium loaded organic extractant phase containing, usually, a tertiary amine capable of forming organic soluble uranium complexes. The sulphate containing aqueous strip liquor is fed in co current with the extractant phase to be stripped through a number of mixing stages in series connected one to another without intermediate settling stages and finally to a final settling stage. A primary dispersion is maintained in each mixing stage and controlled stepwise pH adjustment of the mixing stages is effected by metered addition of a base, such as ammonia.
