## Description
TELEPHONE CALL COST MONITORThis invention relates to a telephone call cost monitor for sensing signals passing along a telephone line. The monitor can generate signals which it can then process to provide call cost information which can be displayed or passed on for further processing.The monitor can be adapted to detect specific call charge signals passing along a telephone line to provide information relating to the cost of a telephone call. Apparatus for this purpose is known, but needs to be connected directly to the line. This requires installation by a skilled electrician and the permission of the owners of the telephone line.An object of the present invention is to provide a telephone call cost monitor which can operate without direct electrical connection to a conductor along which signals pass.The invention provides a telephone call charge monitor characterised in that it comprises a pick up of conducting material capable of being disposed closely adjacent an insulated, signal carrying telephone line, a detector capable of detecting signals generated in the pick up due to signals in said line an amplifier for amplifying the detected signals to provide information signals a memory for storing information relating to call costs and an arithmetic unit for comprising the information signals with information from the memory to generate further signals indicative of the cost of a call for display and or further processing.The pick up may be in the fdrm of a wire wrappable around the insulation of the line. The wire may itself be bare or insulated. The detector and amplifier may be part of circuitry contained within a casing. The casing may carry an alphanumeric display and a keyboard.The monitor can sense specifically provided line signals, representative of the cost of a telephone call, being transmitted down the telephone line by the telephone company or other authority. Each line signal may be a pulse or a group of pulses each or the group representing a unit of charge. In this case the circuitry in the casing must be capable of storing information relating to each pulse or group, with a charge tariff. When each pulse or group of pulses arrives during a telephone call being monitored, the circuitry generates signals indicating the cost of the call and may display them or process them. The cost can be displayed and updated during the call or as a total at the end of the call. The cost of each call can be added to a running total held in a memory which running total can be used to check the user s telephone bill at the end of each account period, e.g. quarter.The casing can resemble a pocket calculator, having a similar size and layout to such an instrument. A printer can be connected to the circuitry to enable a written record to be produced if desired. The circuitry can be adapted to sense the number dialled for each call and to record and display it in conjunction with the cost.As a possible variation, the monitor can be provided with a programmable memory and an arithmetic unit, a user being able to introduce into the memory information specifying the location of the monitor identified by the telephone number or similar information . In this case the monitor would sense the number being dialled and the acquisition of a response from the number dialled. When a correct connection is made the arithmetic unit would compare the number called with information in its memory, calculate the charge rate and time the call to generate signals representative of the call cost which could be displayed and or processed, eg by storage or passing on to a computer or central data handling system.The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a preferred apparatus of the invention Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of the preferred apparatus andFig. 3 is a plan view of a casing of the apparatus.A preferred telephone call charge monitor of the invention includes a housing 10 Fig. 3 which mounts a keyboard 11 and an LCD alphanumeric display 12. The housing 10 contains circuitry Figs. 1 and 2 and batteries not shown .A pick up is in the form of a lead 13 which plugs into a socket in the housing 10 and whose end remote from the housing 10 can be wrapped closely around the insulation covering of a telephone line 14 Fig. 1 . To facilitate this the distal end of the lead can be formed into a resilient helical coil, e.g. of spring material, to maintain it in close proximity to the telephone line conductor. The size and length of the end portion of the lead 13 is such Ã…as to dispose adjacent the telephone line an effective plate 15 of area about 1000 mm2. This plate provides capacitative coupling with the telephone line which causes signals to be generated in the lead 13 in response to signals passing along the telephone line.The signals in the lead 13 are detected by a detector 16, shaped and amplified at 17, to become information pulses and passed to a calculator part 18 of the circuitry. Here the incoming pulses and stored tariff information are combined to produce display pulses which can activate a display 19 or be treated further.The valves and types of the components used in the circuitry or Fig. 2 are as follows Description Reference 100R 1 4W resistor R17 120k 1 4W resistor R9 100K 1 4W resistor R11 220K 1 4W resistor R10 820K 1 4W resistor R18IM 1 4W resistor R1, 6, 7, 8, 3, 14, 15 16 10M 1 4W resistor R2, 3, 4, 5, 12IN4148 Diode D1, 2, 3, 4 5 1Onf Ceramic capacitor C1, 5, 6 7 100nf Polyester capacitor C2, 3 8 luf Electroly c Capicitor C4 4066 Integrated Circuit ICI 2 3 4069 Integrated Circuit IC4T6014 Integrated Circuit IC5LCD Display LCD 1 8 Way Molex Connector CON 1 2 2mm PCB Mounted Sockets SKT1 2Printed Circuit Boards PCB A CIn operation the apparatus automatically begins to count charge pulses and to display the cost of the call as soon as the call commences.When the call is finished, the user presses the End Call key whereupon the total cost of the call is displayed and is added to a running total kept in a memory.As variations on the above, the apparatus can sense the number dialled as each call is made and store this information with the call cost. Any information generated or collected can be fed to an attached printer to provide a written record. An output from the apparatus can be connected to a computer to enable telephone usage to be centrally monitored, for example in a business.The above embodiment is suitable for use with a telephone system wherein call charge pulses are provided on the line by the telephone line owner. If, however, such pulses are not provided, a slightly more sophisticated version of the monitor can generate call charge costs from stored information and the number dialled. In this version, the monitor has a memory which can store a list of telephone numbers or area codes thereof together with an indication of the position of the monitor, eg by the telephone number or area code of the telephone with which it is used, and has an arithmetic unit which can, when a call has been dialled, sense the number or area code dialled, compare it with the location of the monitor, determine from stored call charge information the rate of charge, and by monitoring the duration of the call calculate the cost thereof. This information, eg in the form of pulses, can be displayed during or at the end of the each call, and or passed to the memory for storage and eventual recall, and or passed on to a central data processing arrangement for further processing as might be needed in a businessWhen call charges vary with the time of day, the monitor may contain a clock in its circuitry capable of taking the changes into account. Alternatively, the monitor could have an external switch enabling the operator to specify, for example, full rate or cheap rate before dialling. Cheap or full rate, time of day and or the actual number dialled could be stored in the memory for eventual recall, for example by the print out. Although reference has been made to telephone call throughout the specification, it will be appreciated that the monitor of the invention can be applied to any use of a telephone line wherein time is charged for, such as telex, telecopier, computer terminal connection and like functions other than verbal telephone communication.
