# Method for production of titanium halide catalyst component, catalyst system including such component, and polymerization of alpha olefins using such system.

## Abstract
A titanium halide containing component suitable for use in a catalyst system comprising said component and an aluminum containing component is obtained by co pulverizing a halogen containing magnesium compound, e.g. MgCl₂, with an electron donor compound, e.g. ethyl benzoate, to produce a co pulverized product. The co pulverized product is then reacted with an organic phosphite, e.g. triphenyl phosphite, to produce a reaction product. The reaction product is then reacted with a titanium halide compound, e.g. TiCl₄. A catalyst system for the polymeriza tion of alpha olefins includes such titanium halide containing component and an organoaluminum component.
