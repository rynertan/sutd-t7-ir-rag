# Graticule sensor.

## Abstract
A sensor is described for determining the position of a graticule which has a series of transparent and opaque areas back illuminated with a diffused source of light. A light source 40 for illuminating the graticule 30 to produce an image of the graticule 30 a plurality of light detectors 52, 54 arranged to receive the image of the graticule 30 , and to produce outputs in response to the image, and means 48 for combining the outputs from the light detectors 52,54 to produce a combined output signal, characterised by a lens 44 for focusing the image of the graticule 30 on to the light detectors 52, 54 , whereby the combined output signal will be indicative of relative movement between the graticule and the detectors. The image cast by the graticule 30 has focused onto a light detector array 52, 54 . Alternate elements of the light detector array 52, 54 are connected in parallel to provide two signals which are 180 degrees out of phase from each other. These signals are then processed and subtracted so that amplitude transitions result as the grati cule alternately covers and uncovers detector elements.
