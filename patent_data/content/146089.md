## Description
CAPACITOR WITH DIELECTRIC COMPRISING POLYFUNCTIONAL ACRYLATE POLYMER, METHOD OF MAKING, AND COMPOSITIONS USEFUL THEREIN This invention relates to electrical capacitors.More particularly, it relates to novel capacitors having polyfunctional acrylate polymer dielectrics, and a method for making them. The development of electronic devices and circuits of reduced size has led to a need for significantly smaller capacitors having increased capacity per unit volume and high temperature capabilities. In particular, such capacitors should be characterized by a low dissipation factor over a wide temperature range in order to conserve energy in the capacitor under operation conditions. Since, however, no single capacitor capable of satisfying the variety of service conditions and requirements was known or available, a number of different ones were developed over the years along three main product lines, i.e., the ceramic type, the metallized film type and the electrolytic type. The utility of many of these, however, is limited to somewhat less than the total electronic range up to about 100 microfarads.Moreover, each has other important shortcomings. For example, solid tantalum capacitors of the electrolytic type and ceramic multi layer capacitors typically have a relatively high dissipation factor and also an undesirable failure mode. On the other hand, the metallized film capacitors have very limited volumetric efficiency and totally lack surface mounting capability. In short, all presently available capacitors are deficient in various respects such as size, long term electronic stability and capability to oper ate satisfactorily at temperatures in the range of 230 2800C. The evolution of the art has accordingly entailed compromises resulting in general recognition of the need for a better answer to the problem. In this well developed art, that need is one of relatively long standing. In the copending, simultaneously filed,commonly assigned application, our reference 1O398 3cA O3594 36cA O357O, there is dis.losed a novel capadtarstructure having prRicularly advantageous properties which make them adaptable to a wide variety of service conditions and requirements.Said structure comprises successive conductive layers which are offset so as to define a central capacitance region of stacked isolated extending layers, a coating of dielectric deposited on each of said layers so that the layers in the capacitance region are substantially spaced and separated by said coating of dielectric, said coating deposition being controlled so as to slope toward cutoff lines spaced substantially from two separated portions of the central capacitor region, said layer deposition extending beyond said cutoff lines so that successive layers fuse into spaced apart terminal portions, and said cutoff line spacing being sufficient to cause the uppermost dielectric coating of said capacitor to have a horizontal dimension from the capacitor region to the terminal portion to accept a final layer deposition.The disclosure of said application is incorporated by reference herein. A principal object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide novel capacitors having an improved resin dielectrics, and a method for making them. A further object is to provide such capacitors which are capable of use over a wide range of conditions and in a wide variety of applications. A further object is to provide capacitors in which the dielectric has a low dissipation factor and a relatively low degree of capacitance change over a wide temperature range and a wide variety of operating conditions. A further object is to provide novel ester monomers and polymers thereof. A still further object is to provide ester monomers which, upon polymerization, yield materials suitable for use as dielectrics. Still another object is to provide ester monomers whose polymers have low dissipation factors over an extremely wide range of temperatures. Still another object is to provide polymeric dielectric materials useful in thin film capacitors. Still another object is to provide ester monomers which are easy to deposit as thin films, said films being subsequently polymerizable by irradiation or the like to form layers useful as dielectrics in thin film capacitors. Other objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention includes capacitors comprising two electrodes sep arated by a dielectric member, said dielectric member comprising a polymer of at least one polyfunctional acrylate having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 is a hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical containing at least 4 carbon atoms R2 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 5 carbon atoms and n is from 2 to 6. The electrodes in the capacitors of this invention may be formed of materials and in configurations known in the art. Typical conductive materials useful as electrodes are aluminum, copper, zinc, tin, stainless steel and alloys thereof, with aluminum being preferred. The dielectric members are, as previously noted, polymers of polyfunctional acrylates having formula I. In that formula, the R1 value is a hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical containing at least 4 carbon atoms. The types of substituents which are permisable will be apparent to those skilled in the art and generally include substituents having only minor effects on the electrical properties of the molecule. Illustrative substituents of this type are hydroxy, alkoxy, carbalkoxy and nitrile substituents. Most often, however, the R1 value is an unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical. The R1 value contains at least 4 carbon atoms.There is no real upper limit to the number of carbon atoms therein it is within the scope of the invention to use compounds of formula I in which R1 is a polymeric radical containing, for example, as many as 500 and preferably up to about 300 carbon atoms. The R1 radical may contain aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic moieties or a mixture thereof. Preferably, however, all moieties present therein are aliphatic, alicyclic or both. The R2 value, as previously noted, may be hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 5 carbon atoms. Most often, R2 is hydrogen or methyl and especially hydrogen. Thus, the term acrylate as used herein embraces both acrylates and u substituted acrylates including methacrylates and the like, although the acrylates i.e. the compounds in which R2 is hydrogen are usually preferred. The value of n may be from 2 to 6, and is most often 2 or 3. From the foregoing, it will be apparent that the compounds of formula I may typically be prepared by esterification of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or the like, or functional derivatives thereof such as the acid chlorides, anhydrides and lower alkyl esters, with a wide variety of compounds containing the R1 value. Illustrative compounds of this type are polyhydroxy compounds and polyepoxides.Particularly useful polyfunctional acrylates of formula I are the following Acrylates of aliphatic polyhydroxy compounds containing about 4 20 carbon atoms, illustrated by neopentyl glycol trimethylolpropane, 1,6 hexanediol and a, diol mixtures having an average chain length of 12 20 carbon atoms. Acrylates of polymers having groups capable of reacting with acrylic acid or derivatives thereof. Ilustrative are various hydroxy terminated diene polymers such as polybutadiene, typically having a number average molecular weight within the range of about 1000 5000. Acrylates of aromatic diepoxides and polyepoxides, illustrated by diepoxy derivatives of 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane or bisphenol A . A number of commercially available polyfunctional acrylates are useful for the preparation of dielectrics in the capacitors of this invention. Among them are the following, many of which are identified by trademarks as indicated Trimethylolpropane triacrylate. Neopentyl glycol diacrylate. Bisphenol A diacrylate. Celanese Celrad 3700 , a diacrylate of a diepoxide derived from bisphenol A. Sartomer SR 349 , a diacrylate of ethoxylated bisphenol A. Sartomer Chemlink 2000 , a diacrylate of an a, alkanediol containing an average of 14 15 carbon atoms. A diacrylate of Arco Poly bd, which is a hydroxy terminated butadiene resin having a number average molecular weight of about 3000. While it is within the scope of the invention to use a single polyfunctional compound in forming the dielectric, it is often preferred to employ copolymers prepared from blends of two or more such compounds. This may result in lower dissipation factor than is the case for most polyfunctional acrylates used alone. It may also optimize the physical properties of the material, e.g., lower the viscosity of the monomer composition to facilitate its deposition. It is also within the scope of the invention to use copolymers prepared from mixtures of at least one compound of formula I with at least one monoacrylate of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein R2 is as previously defined and R3 is a hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical, typically containing about 4 25 carbon atoms. Illustrative monoacrylates of formula II are cyclohexyl methacrylate and various acrylated derivatives of fatty acids containing such substituents as carbomethoxy or nitrile. Typical copolymers of compounds of formulas I and II contain about 10 50 by weight, most often about 15 35 , of compounds of formula II with the balance being compounds of formula I. With respect to these commercially available acrylates and the like, it is frequently preferred to remove residual acrylic acid and other ionic compounds and impurities which may be present in the materials as received from the supplier. Such impurities are readily removed by known methods such as the use of absorption columns or ion exchange resins. Illustrative polyfunctional acrylate compositions whose polymers are suitable as dielectrics in the capacitors of this invention are illustrated in Tables I and II. All percentages in these tables are by volume.

The R1 radical in this preferred subgenus may be aliphatic, alicyclic or mixed aliphatic alicyclic it may optionally contain up to about three olefinic linkages which are non conjugated, and contains about 10 40 carbon atoms.Suitable polyhydroxy compounds include straight chain compounds such as hexadecanediol and octadecanediol, with the hydroxy groups being located anywhere on the chain, and branched chain isomers thereof. By branched chain is meant that at least one carbon atom is present in a branch.Thus, configurations such as HO CH2 150H andEMI9.1 are unbranched, whileEMI9.2 are branched. A first preferred class of polyhydroxy compounds within this subgenus consists of those characterized by being branched and also by having at least 18 carbon atoms in a single chain that is, at least 18 carbon atoms are successively bonded without branching. Particularly suitable polyfunctional acrylates derived therefrom are those having the formulasEMI10.1 wherein r and s are each 7 or 8 and the sum of r and s is 15. They may be obtained, for example, by acrylic acid esterification of the hydroformylation products of oleic acid, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,243,818. Another suitable compound is 1,12 octadecanediol diacrylate, formed by hydrogenolysis of ricinoleic acid followed by esterification. Also within this first preferred class of polyhydroxy compounds are novel single compounds and mixtures, especially mixtures, in which R1 is at least one aliphatic or alicyclic radical containing about 20 40 carbon atoms and optionally up to about three non conjugated olefinic linkages. At least about 40 , and preferably at least about 50 , of the total number of R1 radicals therein are alicyclic. Thus, the polyhydroxy compounds may be entirely alicyclic or may be mixtures of acyclic and alicyclic compounds satisfying these percentage limitations. It is frequently convenient to prepare such polyhydroxy compounds by reduction of at least one corresponding polycarboxylic acid or ester thereof, which may be saturated or may contain olefinic linkages. A typical suitable polycarboxylic acid is linoleic acid dimer hereinafter dimer acid , a mixture consisting essentially of acyclic, monocyclic and bicyclic dicarboxylic acids which typically contain up to two olefinic bonds per molecule. A particularly suitable dimer acid is sold by Emery Industries under the trade designation Empol 1010 .According toKirk Othmer, Encoclopedia of Chemical Technology, ThirdEdition, Volume 7, pp. 768 770, the following are structures of typical molecular species present in the methyl ester of dimer acid EMI11.1 EMI12.1 Thus, free dimer acid obviously comprises free dicarboxylic acids having corresponding structures. The esters of formulas V, VI and VII, their corresponding free acids, and similar polycarboxylic acids and esters may be reduced by known methods, such as by hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst or by lithium aluminum hydride, to produce diols useful for preparation of the polyfunctional acrylates. Depending on the method of reduction of these or similar acids or esters, the reduction product may be saturated or may contain olefinic linkages.For example, lithium aluminum hydride reduction normally will not affect olefinic linkages while some hydrogenation methods e.g., in the presence of a palladium catalyst will reduce them to saturated linkages. Thus, reduction of compounds V, VI and VII may produce diols of the respective formulasEMI12.2 EMI13.1 wherein the broken lines and hydrogen atoms in brackets indicate that the corresponding carbon carbon bonds may be single or double bonds depending on the method of reduction.It is frequently found that the compounds which contain only single bonds have properties somewhat more favorable than those of the analogous double bonded compounds. Suitable diol mixtures of this type are commercially available fromHenkel Corporation under the trade name Dimerol . Other suitable polyhydroxy compounds within this first preferred class may be prepared by reduction of various acrylic acid unsaturated fatty acid condensation products. These polyhydroxy compounds may be illustrated by the formulaEMI13.2 wherein m may be, for example, from 3 to 5, p may be from 7 to 9 and the sum of m and p is 12. A typical commercially available dicarboxylic acid which may be reduced to a diol of formula XI is sold under the trade designation Westvaco 1550 Diacid it has the formulaEMI14.1 and is an adduct of linoleic and acrylic acids. It is also described in Kirk Othmer, op. cit., at p. 779. A second preferred class of polyhydroxy compounds consists of 1,2 alkanediols in which R1 has the formula 4 XIII R4CHCH2 , wherein R4 is an alkyl radical containing about 8 28 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable R4 radicals are 1 octyl, 2 methylheptyl, 1 nonyl, 2,3 dimethylheptyl, 1 decyl, 2 dodecyl, 1 tetradecyl, 1 octadecyl, 1 eicosyl and 1 docosyl. Radicals having the formula R5CH2, wherein R5 is an alkyl and especially a straight chain alkyl radical having about 7 27 and most often about 9 17 carbon atoms, are preferred as R4. Also within the preferred subgenus of the capacitor of this invention are those in which the dielectric is a polymer of novel mixtures of esters having formulas I and EMI15.1 wherein R6 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing about 1 20 carbon atoms and free from acetylenic and polymerizable ethylenic unsaturation and m is less than n and is from 1 to 3 at least about 50X of the carboxylate moieties in said compositions having the formulaEMI15.2 Such polymers have low dissipation factors over a still wider temperature range than those described hereinabove. As will be apparent from formula XIV, the constituents of these ester mixtures include mixed esters containing both acrylate moieties and carboxylate moieties derived from a carboxylic acid of the formula R6COOH in which R6 contains about 2 19 carbon atoms and is free from acetylenic 6 and polymerizable ethylenic unsaturation. The R6 groups are preferably alkyl radicals, especially those containing 1 7 and most often 2 4 carbon atoms. Illustrative carboxylic acids of this type are acetic, propionic, butyric, 2 ethylhexanoic, lauric, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids. As described in the afonmEntioned siniltaneously filed wplicaticn our ref. 10398 36Ca 03594 36Ch 03570 the capacitors of this inven tion are frequently produced by a rrethod which includes vapor deposition of monomers, followed by polymerization to form the dielectric member. Vapor deposition conditions for the above described ester mixtures are optimized when the carboxylate moieties are substantially similar in their contributions to the volatility of the ester mixture. Therefore, it is most preferred that R5 be of a size and molecular weight similar to that of the corresponding moiety in the acrylate radical, and specifically that R5 be the ethyl radical, that is, that R5CooH be propionic acid. Of the total number of carboxylate moieties in these ester mixtures, at least about 50 , usually about 65 99 and preferably about 70 90 , have formula XV. Thus, a major proportion of the carboxylate moieties are polymerizable. Procedures for esterification of the polyhydroxy compounds will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Thus, the alcohol and acids may typically be reacted in a suitable solvent, typically in the presence of a small amount of an acidic esterification catalyst such as sulfuric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, acidic ion exchange resins or acidified clays. Ordinarily, a stoichiometric excess of the acids is used, the ratio of equivalents of acid to diol typically being between about 1.1 1 and about 4 1 Any excess acid may be removed by washing with aqueous alkaline solutions after esterification. In order to minimize the amount of esters of the formula EMI17.1 in the previously described ester mixtures, it is preferred to prepare such mixtures by reacting the polyhydroxy compound sequentially with the two acids. This may be done in either order it is somewhat preferred to react first with the acrylic acid. The mole ratio of acrylic acid to the other acid is at least 1 1, most often about 1.65 1.99 1 and preferably about 1.7 1.9 1. Because there is some degree of uncertainty about the exact proportions of the various esters in such mixtures, it is also appropriate to define said mixtures in terms of the sequential method for their preparation. The esterification reaction is ordinarily carried out at about 50 2000C, most often about 60 1500C. It is often preferred to incorporate in the esterification mixture a minor amount of a polymerization inhibitor such as p methoxyphenol, 2,6 di t butylphenol or 2,4,6 tri t butylphenol.The acids may be replaced by functional derivatives thereof such as the corresponding acyl halides, lower alkyl esters or amides, with suitable modification of the reaction conditions. The preparation of polyfunctional acrylates and ester mixtures useful in this invention is illustrated by the following examples. All parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 12 A mixture of 102 parts by weight 0.34 mole of a commercially available from Henkel Corporation diol having the formulaEMI18.1 in which the sum of r and s is 15, 2.55 parts of p methoxyphenol and 2.38 parts of p toluenesulfonic acid in 153 parts of n hexane was heated to reflux with stirring and 5.44 parts 0.76 mole of acrylic acid was added over several hours. Heating was continued as water was removed by azeotropic distillation. When the theoretical amount of water had been removed, the solution was diluted with 206 parts of n hexane and extracted five times with a 3 by weight aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and twice with aqueous sodium chloride solution.Upon evaporation of the hexane, there was obtained 127 parts 92 of theoretical of the diacrylate which was filtered through glass fibers and stabilized by the addition of 100 ppm of p methoxyphenol. EXAMPLE 13 A mixture of 100 grams 0.3 mole of a commercially available from Henkel Corporation triol having the formulaEMI18.2 in which the sum of r and s is 15, 0.3 gram of p methoxyphenol and 2 grams of p toluenesulfonic acid in 500 ml. of toluene was heated to 1200C and 115 ml. 1.64 moles of acrylic acid was added dropwise. Heating was continued as water was removed by azeotropic distillation. When the theoretical amount of water had been removed, the solution was washed with aqueous potassium carbonate solution and dried. The desired triacrylate was obtained as a liquid upon evaporation of solvent. EXAMPLE 14 Following a procedure similar to that of Example 13, 1,12 octadecanediol diacrylate was prepared. EXAMPLE 15 To a solution of 96 grams 2.5 moles of lithium aluminum hydride in 3000 ml. of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise, with stirring, 400 grams 0.71 mole of Empol 1010 dimer acid. The mixture was heated under reflux for about 40 hours and then neutralized by the sequential addition of 96 ml. of water, 96 ml. of 15 percent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and 288 ml. of water. The neutralized mixture was filtered and the solvent was evaporated from the filtrate to yield the desired diol. A solution of 200 grams 0.37 mole of the diol, 157 ml. 2.24 moles of acrylic acid, 3 grams of p toluenesulfonic acid and 0.5 gram of p methoxyphenol in 1000 ml.of toluene was heated under reflux as water was removed by azeotropic distillation. When the stoichiometric amount of water about 13.3 ml. had been removed, the solution was cooled, filtered and washed several times with dilute potassium carbonate solution and once with dilute sodium chloride solution. It was then dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated to afford the desired diacrylate as a liquid. EXAMPLE 16 Following the procedure of Example 15, Westvaco 1550 Diacid was reduced by lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran to a diol having formula VIII in which m is 5, p is 7 and the broken line indicates a double bond. This diol 85 grams, 0.25 mole was reacted with acrylic acid 90 ml., 1.28 mole in toluene solution to yield the desired diacrylate as a liquid. EXAMPLE 17 Following a procedure similar to that of Example 13, a liquid diacrylate was prepared from a commercially available diol which was in turn prepared by hydrogenation of a methyl ester of linoleic acid dimer, and whose principal components have formulas VII I, IX and X wherein the broken lines represent predominantly single bonds.

The polyfunctional acrylates and ester mixtures may be polymerized under free radical conditions, either alone or in the presence of other monomers. The term polymer, as used herein, includes addition homopolymers and copolymers with one or more other monomers. Polymers of the novel polyfunctional acrylates and ester mixtures are another aspect of the invention. Polymerization by the free radical method may be effected in bulk, solution, suspension or emulsion, by contacting the monomer or monomers with a polymerization initiator either in the absence or presence of a diluent at a temperature of about 0 2O00C. Suitable initiators include benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, acetyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, persulfate bisulfite, persulfate sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, chlorate sulfite and the like.

By virtue of their polyfunctionality, the acrylates and ester mixtures disclosed herein form crosslinked polymers. Thus, they are adapted to the production of heat resistant polymeric films. The polymers of this invention are useful, for example, in the preparation of corrosion resistant coatings and as ingredients for printing inks. They are also useful as insulating materials in certain electrical applications for example, as potting compositions and as encapsulation resins. The polymers are particularly useful as dielectric compositions in capacitors, because of their adaptability to the production of capacitors with high efficiency and with a low dissipation factor over a very wide temperature range.Referring particularly to the ester mixtures previously described, while the invention is not dependent on any theory of operation, it is believed that the R6 groups therein act as plasticizing agents, causing a lowering of phase transition points of some kind at which there is a change in the conductivity properties of the polymer, and which otherwise may appear at temperatures generally in the vicinity of 20 to 300C. A preferred subgenus of the polymers of this invention from the standpoint of use as dielectric members for capacitors consists of polymers in which all of the units are derived from the polyfunctional acrylates or ester mixtures of this invention. Also contemplated are copolymers of said polyfunctional acrylates or ester mixtures with other mono and polyacrylates. Illustrative of suitable monoacrylates are those of higher monohydroxy alcohols such as isodecyl alcohol or of higher monoepoxides, the term higher denoting at least 8 carbon atoms. The preferred copolymers, however, are those with polyfunctional acrylates previously disclosed herein, such as those of trimethylolpropane, neopentyl glycol, polybutadiene derived polyols and polyepoxides.The copolymers are typically prepared from blends comprising about 25 75 by weight of the polyfunctional acrylates or ester mixtures of this invention, with the balance being other acrylates. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown in schematic form a capacitor comprising lower electrode 10 which may be aluminum foil, a dielectric coating 11 of a polyfunctional acrylate polymer which may be formed by deposition of one of the above described acrylate compositions on the surface of electrode 10 by, for example, vacuum evaporation or roller coating and suitable polymerization, and upper electrode 12 which is a thin metallized layer of aluminum deposited on dielectric film 11. Leads 13 nd 14 are respectively attached to lower and upper electrodes 10 and 12. Another aspect of the present invention is a method of making a capacitor, said method comprising the steps of forming on a substrate a dielectric coating of a polymer of at least one polyfunctional acrylate as previously described and depositing an electrode layer on said dielectric coating. The coating may be produced by applying the polymer, optionally in solution in a substantially inert solvent, by conventional means such as flowing, spraying, dipping, brushing, roller coating, spin coating, drawing down or the like, followed by evaporation of any solvent used. It is usually preferred, however, to apply a poly functional acrylate monomer film and subsequently polymerize it by one of the methods previously described.The use of electron beam polymerization is particularly preferred since such a process very rapidly polymerizes the monomer composition without the need for additional curing agents, and thus leads to economical production of very thin coatings. In one embodiment of the method of this invention, the substrate is itself a conductive material which may serve as an electrode, whereupon the two electrodes and the dielectric coating separating them may constitute the entire capacitor. Figure 4 of the drawing is an illustrative flow diagram of this embodiment which is also illustrated by the following example. EXAMPLE 22 Uniform prototype capacitors were produced by drawing down layers of the compositions of Examples 1 11 on an aluminum foil substrate, polymerizing said monomer layer by contact with an electron beam, and depositing a metallic aluminum layer thereon. The thickness of the aluminum foil electrode was 12.5 microns, that of the dielectric layer was 3 6 microns and that of the deposited aluminum electrode was 300 500 Angstroms 0.03 0.05 micron . The areas of the prototype capacitors were about 1 square inch. The dissipation factors of said capacitors were measured at 60 Hz.using an AC bridge. Figures 2 and 3 graphically depict the relationship between temperature and dissipation factor for typical prototype capacitors prepared as described above in which the polyfunctional acrylate compositions of Examples 1 and 2, respectively, were respectively polymerized by 15 and 10 megarad electron beams to form the dielectric coatings.As is apparent, the dissipation factors remained well below 0.3X from 300 to 1300C. Table III lists the dissipation factors at various temperatures of other typical capacitors made as described above, using the previously described polyfunctional acrylate compositions.

The capacitors thus produced have particularly advantageous tempera properties, such as high efficiency,capability of operation at high tures, long term electronic stability, favorable failure mode and versatility over a wide range of capacitances. The following examples illustrate some of the advantageous properties of such capacitors. EXAMPLE 23The procedure described it the afore trentioned, snaltaneously filed a,nplication, our ref. 10398 36CA 03594 36Ck 03570, was used to foil prepare a capacitor about 18mm in width. The substrate was alumunium about 50 microns thick. Alternate dielectric thickness about 1 micron and electrode thickness about 200 500Angstroms layers were deposited. The dielectric layers were formed by evaporation of the product of Example 12 at 3750C and deposition on an electrode surface maintained at 240C, followed by electron beam initiated polymerization, and the electrode layers by vapor deposition of aluminum.The finished capacitor contained 1000 layers each of dielectric and deposited electrode. The dissipation factor thereof, measured at 60 Hz. over a 30 1500C temperature range, varied from a maximum of 3.10 at 3O0C to a minimum of 0.300 at 1500C. EXAMPLE 24 A capacitor was prepared as described in Example 23, except that dielectric was a polymer of the product ofExample 17, said product was deposited by evaporation at 4000C and deposition at 480C, the thickness of the electrode layers was 300 500 Angstroms and the capacitor contained 200 layers each of dielectric and deposited electrode. The dissipation factor thereof, measured at 100 Hz. over a 30 1300C temperature range, varied from a maximum of 2.8 at 300C to a minimum of 0.7 at 90 1300C. EXAMPLE 25 A number of capacitors, prepared as in Example 23 except for numbers of layers and dielectric layer thickness in some cases, were cut to various sizes to provide specific capacitance values and tested for extended periods under theAC voltage and temperature conditions listed in Table IV.None of said capacitors had failed at the ends of the test periods listed. TABLE IV Capaci Dielectric tance, thickness, micro Temp.Layers microns farads Voltage OC Hours 1000 1.2 0.2 20 130 500 100 1.1 0.19 50 85 664 930 1.1 0.19 25 85 68 50 85 609 500 1 2 20 130 1123 500 1 0.11 25 85 68 50 85 776 500 1.1 0.1 25 85 68 50 85 776 These results show the stability of capacitors of this type over prolonged operation periods at relatively high temperature. EXAMPLE 26 Uniform prototype capacitors were produced as described in Example 22 from the compositions of Examples 12, 13 and 15 17, and the dissipation factors of said capacitors were measured. The results are given in Table V. Table V Dissipation factor, Example 300C 900C 1300C 12 2.7 0.40 0.15 13 0.85 1.10 0.95 15 0.75 0.05 0.025 16 0.95 0.70 1.95 17 1.7 0.10 0.12 As will be apparent from the table, capacitors of this invention are characterized by versatility of application, typically including extremely low dissipation factors at both high and low temperatures. EXAMPLE 27 A prototype capacitor produced as described inExample 22 in which the dielectric was a homopolymer of 1,2 hexadecanediol diacrylate the product of Example 21 had a dissipation factor which varied from 0.8 at 300C to 0.45 at 1100C and 0.6 at 1500C and a change in capacitance which, using the value at 300C as a baseline, varied from 1.2 at 8O0C to 0.8 at 1500C. These results show that said homopolymer, when used as a capacitor dielectric, is characterized by particularly low capacitance change over a wide range of temperatures. EXAMPLE 28 Prototype capacitors were produced as described inExample 22 from the product of Example 19 and a corresponding diacrylate. The dissipation factor of the test capacitor prepared from the product of Example 1 varied from a minimum of 0.3 at 300C to a maximum of 1.45 at 1500C. The dissipation factor of the capacitor prepared from the diacrylate varied from a maximum of 2.7 at 300C to a minimum of 0.15fed at 1300C. As will be apparent from the foregoing examples, capacitors containing the polymers of this invention as dielectrics are characterized by versatility of application, frequently including extremely low dissipation factors at both high and low temperatures and low capacitance change over a wide range of temperatures. In addition to the capacitor structures previously disclosed herein, the present invention is applicable to wound roll and other known types of capacitors. The dielectric coating in suitable cases may be a self supporting film, instead of being adherently deposited on the electrode substrate.
