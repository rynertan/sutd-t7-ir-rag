# Variable size character display with obscured characters.

## Abstract
A data display arrangement in which selected characters arranged in rows of characters of notionally standard size which are displayed on the screen of a CRT, can be enlarged selectively at the expense of obscuring other characters, or of preventing other characters being displayed enlarged size. The character size for a displayed character is determined by a size attribute code which accompanies the character code for the character. If an attribute code for a character is changed, the change in the size of the character as displayed can re veal previously obscured characters which in turn may be dis played different size if an accompanying attribute code of that effect can now be implemented. These changes can result in ripple effects through the whole display. The invention pro vides a register and buffer arrangement in which character data and size attribute data for each character position of each character row is examined and altered in accordance with an obscured character algorithm which allows ripple effects to occur and ensures that data for display at obscured positions is not lost.
