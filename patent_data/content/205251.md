# Antihelmintic macrocyclic lactones and their production by fermentation.

## Abstract
A novel microorganism ATCC 53110 is formed by the protoplast fusion of strains of Streptomyces avermitilis and Streptomyces hygroscopicus. A novel macrolide is isolated from the fermentation broth of this microorganism. The struc ture of the novel compounds isolated from the microorgan ism is presented based upon analytical studies. The com pounds are highly potent antiparasitic, insecticidal, and anthelmintic agents, and may be made into suitable composi tions for pharmaceutical, veterinary and agricultural use. The compounds have the formula
