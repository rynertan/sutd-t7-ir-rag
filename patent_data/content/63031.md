# Polyester blend compositions exhibiting suppression of transesterification.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a non burning, non dripping polyester blend composition in which transester ification is suppressed, as indicated by, e.g., improved heat deflection temperature. The composition comprises a approximately 35 to 85 percent by weight of a blend of polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate wherein the polyethylene terephthalate comprises approx imately 10 to 25 percent by weight of the blend b approximately 5 to 60 percent by weight of a reinforcing agent c approximately 4 to 15 percent by weight of at least one halogen containing organic flame retardant compound and d approximately 2 to 10 percent by weight of the amorphous non abrasive reaction product of antimony triox ide, or a compound of antimony which generates antimony trioxide, and a substrate comprising a hydrous compound of silicon in a weight ratio within the range of approximately 1 1 to 1 4, on an antimony trioxide substrate basis. The composition may further comprise approximately 0.1 to 8 percent by weight of a thermoplastic phenoxy resin and or approximately 0.5 to 2.5 percent by weight of a polytetra fluoroethylene resin. The amorphous non abrasive reaction product is preferably the reaction product of antimony trioxide and talc, preferably in a 25 75 or 45 55 weight ratio. A process for suppressing transesterification in glass rein forced, non burning, non dripping polyester blend composi tions is also disclosed.
