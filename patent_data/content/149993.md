# Ventilation structure of clutch.

## Abstract
In a clutch of such a type that a fork inserting hole is formed at a certain position of a side wall of a clutch housing, so as to insert and install a clutch release fork from an outer side of the clutch housing, a ventilation structure of the clutch comprises a ventilation duct having a ventilation passage mounted to the fork inserting hole. An inner end of the ventilation passage is opened into the clutch housing, and an outer end of the ventilation passage is opened to an external area. With this arrangement, ventilation of the inside area of the clutch housing may be smoothly carried out by effectively utilizing the fork inserting hole without closing the hole with a blind plug, thereby improving a cooling effect of the clutch.
