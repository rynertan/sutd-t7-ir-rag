# Production of aromatics from ethane and or ethylene.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon feedstock rich in C₂ hydrocarbons. In particular it is a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons comprising bringing into contact at a temperature between 580 C and 750 C hydrocarbon feed stock containing at least 70 by weight of C₂ hydrocarbons with a catalyst composition comprising an aluminosilicate having gallium deposited thereon and or an aluminosilicate in which cations have been exchanged with gallium ions, said aluminosilicates containing silica to alumina in a molar ratio of at least 5 1. The process affords a one step method of upgrading C₂ feedstock into aromatics.
