# Method and apparatus for low pressure chemical vapor deposition.

## Abstract
A method of introducing a controlled flow of vapor from a high pressure sublimation chamber into a low pressure vapor deposition reactor, said vapor being derived from solid source material preferably, but not necessarily, having a vapor pressure above about one 1 Torr at a temperature not exceeding about 350 C. The method comprises controll ably heating the source material to a temperature sufficient to produce vapor therefrom at a desired pressure, and then controllably transferring the vapor through vapor transmis sion means to the vapor deposition reactor. During such transfer, the transmission means is maintained at a tempera ture sufficient to prevent condensation of the vapor therein during transfer. The vapor is delivered to the reactor in a pure state and is not mixed with any carrier medium.
