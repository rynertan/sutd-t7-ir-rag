# A device for reading the optical signal provided by a refractometer.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a device for reading the optical signal provided by a refractometer. A device such as this basically comprises a photo electric transducer 6 which is made to shift, by means of an electric motor 10 , in correspondence to the optical signal provided by a refractometer of the type which uses the critical angle of refraction and the total reflection, and reveals the zone of light 3a , and the zone of shade 4a . The transducer 6 commands an electrical impulse selection meter which is supplied in turn by an impulse generator giving out a fixed number of impulses per revolution of the electric motor 10 , so as to differentiate between those impulses received when the transducer 6 is in shade 4a , and those received when the transducer is inlight 3a . The signal supplied by the impulse selection meter, being appropriately processed, allows the identification of the posi tion of that line of separation 5a between the light and shaded zones 3a,4a provided by the refractometer, and thus to arrive at the refractive index of the substance under exami nation.

## Description
A Device for reading the optical signal provided by a refractometerThe invention herein described is a device for reading the optical signal provided by a refractometer.A refractometer is an instrument which functions by making use of the optical phenomena connected with the crossing by luminous rays from side to side of an area of separation of two substances having differing refractive indices. By using such instruments it is possible,. by the appropriate assessment of these optical phenomena, to measure .the refractive index of a substance.Refractometers are used mostly in the manufacture of foodstuffs, pharmaceutical and petrochemical products etc as, by measuring the refractive index of a .substance, in particular that of a liquid, it becomes possible to arrive at its density and, in the case of a solution, at the degree of concentration of the solution itself.Those refractometers used mainly for the above mentioned purposes utilise the optical phenomena being the critical angle of refraction and the total reflection, and provide an optical signal indicated schematically in fig 1 consisting of a cone which presents a zone of light, and a zone of shade, perfectly distinguishable and divided along a plane of separation, which in the right angled cross sections of the cone appears as a line.The size of the light and shaded zones, or, if one is referring to the cone, the position of the line of separation, is determined by the value of the refractive index of the substance under examination, or if one is dealing with liquids or solutions, of their density and concentration. There are various existing devices for assessing a like optical signal. In one such device the optical signal is passed through a photo electric ce ll, which supplies a voltage proportionate to the size of the illuminated zone.In another device provision is made for a cell to he fixed in a constantly illuminated zone, which gives out an electrical reference signal a second cell, connected to a potentiometer by way of a shaft, shifts by means of a motorised element and centres on the line of .separation so that the electrical signal direc ted.at the line hy the second cell is such, when compared with the fixed signal from th.e fixed first cell , .that it arrests the function of the motorised element. According to the position of the line of separation, and therefore that of the second cell , the potentiometer supplies an electrical signal proportionate to that position which, having been appropriately plotted, will allow arrival at the refractive index of the substance under examination.With regard to the precision of such measurements, these devices respond.to the precision capability of the photo electric cell, in the first instance, and .the potentiometer in the second they also respond to variations however slight in the voltage supply, hence the need for efficient stabiliser circuits to control the voltage.Moreover, devices such as these do not offer reliability in precision across the entire field of reading.One object of the invention herein described is to obviate .the inconveniences listed above, providing a device for reading the optical signal provided by a refractometer which offers a high degr.ee of precision in measurement, and an all but total reliability across the entire field of reading, and which is not affected by variations in the voltage supply.A further object of the invention herein described is to provide a simple device offering a high degree of trustworthiness in.its general function.These objects, and others, are all obtained by the device herein described of a type that functions by utilising a refractometer designed to provide an optical signal consisting of a beam of light whose cross section pre sents a light zone and a shaded zone, perfectly distingu ishable and divided along a line of separation, chara cterised by the fact that it comprises a photo electric transducer placed in cyclical motion by motorised elements comprising an electric motor, along a fixed trajectory which intersects the said line of separation, whatever this latter s position happens to be within the scope of the said optical signal an electrical impulse generator designed to supply a constant number of impulses per revolution of the electric motor an electrical impulse selection meter whose selective operation is commanded by the signal coming from the photo electric transducer, designed to select and count the individual impulses sent out by the said generator when the said transducer is found to be in the shaded zone, separately from those impulses sent out by the generator when the said transducer is found to be in the light zone means for processing the signal provided by the said impulse selection meter.Further characteristics and advantages will emerge more clearly from the detailed description which follows of a preferred, though not exclusive form of embodiment of the invention herein described illustrated purely as an unlimited example in the accompanying drawings, in which fig 1 shows a schematic representation of the optical signal, shown also in cross section, provided by a refractometer of the kind under discussion fig 2 shows a schematic representation of one possible embodiment of drive for the photo electric transducer in the device herein described fig 3 shows a block scheme of one possib.le embodiment of the device herein describedIn fig. 1 block . 1 represents a refractometer of the kind under discussion, from which proceeds .an optical signal constituted by a conical beam 2 which manifests a zone of light 3 and a zone of shade 4 perfectly distinguishable and divided along a plane of .separate tion 5 . Fig. 1 also .shows a circular cross section 2a of the beam 2 one may see in this cros.s section a zone of light 3a which corresponds to zone 3 and a zone of shade 4a which corresponds to zone 4 divided along a line of separation 5a . .The position of the line of separation 5a or the plane. 5 is determined by the refractive index of th substance under examination and shifts, parallel with itself, in sympathy with the variations in the refractive index by reading this position it becomes possible to arrive at the refractive index of the substance under examination. For reading of the position of the line of separation the device herein described comprises a photo electric transducer 6 put into back and forth motion along a rectilinear guide 7 which is disposed perpendicularly with respect to the line of separation and runs between two points, diametrically opposed with respect to the cross section 2a of the beam 2 .The transducer constitutes the sliding extremity of a crank mechanism 8 furnished with a rod 8a and crank 8b the crank 8b is placed in rotation by an electric motor . 12 through the interpositioning of a reduction gear 10 . The cell 6 thus executes a cyclical movement along a fixed trajectory represented by the guide 7 , which intersects the line of separation 5a in whatever position the latter happens to be.Connected to the motor 1 2 is an electrical impulse generator 14 which provides a constant number of impulses per revolution of the motor, which . nmEermayEe regulated in advance.The impulses provided by the generator . 14 are .sent to an impulse selection meter 15 , to which is also sent the electrical signal coming from the transducer 6 which provides an electrical signal or not depending upon whether it is illuminated or not . The said transducer s 6 sensitivity may be regulated in order to permit the correct functioning of the device .even in the .event that the line of separation 5a should be less than precise, or apt to produce halo effects thus when selecting a setting, one would choose that luminous intensity which would break the transducer s 6 signal at the desirable level.The signal supplied by the transducer 6 commands the selective operation of the selection meter 15 so as to produce a separate count of those impulses sent out by the generator . 14 when the transducer 6 is found to be in the light zone as distinct from tho.se impulses .sent out from the generator when the transducer 6 is .found to be in the shaded zone. In this manner, by knowing the differing number of impulses counted in one instance and in the.other, one is able to establish the position of the line of separation 5a inasmuch as the position adopted by the transducer during its movement depends upon the motor s . 12 number of revolutions, upon which also depends the number of impulses sent out by the generator 14 .In other words, for every single revolution of the motor, to which also corresponds a determinate number of impulses, the transducer accomplishes a slight left ward movement as shown e.g. in fig 2 when the transducer 6 crosses a point corresponding to.the line of separation 5a it makes provision for sending that command to the selection meter . 15 which will arrest the count of impulses sent out from the light zone, and commence the count of impulses sent out from the shaded zone. The number of these impulses is thus dependent on the position of the line of separation 5 a . The signal is sent, via a signal processing device 16 and an amplifying circuit 17 , both being of the kinds previuosly mentioned , to instruments which can supply a direct reading of it. In the embodiment shcwn schematically in fig 3, a thermometrical feeler 18 is indicated, which, according to the temerature of the substance under examination, a temperature which might occasion variations in the characteristics of the substance to be measured , carries an electric corrective signal to the device . 16 . Fig 20 indicates an electricity supply circuit.The functioning of the device herein described is not affected by any eventual variation in the voltage supply in fact even if, as a result of such a variation , the motor s 12 angular velocity were to vary, it would do so in like ratio to the velocity of the transducer 6 , for which reason the number of impulses that.is sent out by the generator . 14 per unit of travel of the transducer itself remains constant.It is clear that the type of trajectory and movement accomplished by the transducer whilst scanning the refractometer s signal may be totally different from those described, as indeed those means for transmission of the motor s movement to the transducer may differ this will mean, in effect, only a different processing of the signal proceeding from the meter in order to introduce the appropriate co efficients of proportion between the signal provided by the selection meter and the signal sent to the reading instruments. Likewise it will be apparent, that any combination of signal provided by the selection meter may be utilised for example one may use the number of impulses in light as the signal, or the number of impulses in.shade, or alternatively one may use the difference between the numbers, or their ratio, or yet the ratio between just one of the number of impulses and the total number of impulses produced during the transducer s complete cycle, etc..Other modifications of a practical nature made to the invention herein described could include, for example, any alternative system for processing of the signal proceeding from the selection meter, without there being in any way a deviation from the framework of protection afforded to the conceptual ideas behind the invention as claimed below.
