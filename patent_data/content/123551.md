# Ceiling light fitting.

## Abstract
A ceiling light fitting for lighting a wall so that the illumi nation appears uniform, in particular with sufficient illumina tion at the base of the wall and no fringe effect at the top of the wall. The light fitting has three extended, constant section reflectors 6, 7, 8 which are parallel to the wall, the reflector being swingable back to enable the lamp 5 to be changed. The lamp filament 5a is linear and parallel to the wall. The reflec tors 6, 7 are of part circular section and enhance the light, as well as the reflector 7 acting as a mask to prevent the filament 5a being seen from behind the fitting. The reflector 7 projects very little below ceiling level. The reflector 8 is parabolic with the filament 5a at its focus, the axis of the parabola being directed at the base portion of the wall. The reflector 8 faces downwards and has at least its major part above the level of the filament 5a and on the wall side of the filament 5a. In this way, the main reflecting surface which enhances the illumina tion of the base of the wall is above ceiling level. The extended reflectors 6, 7, 8 can avoid an unpleasant fringe effect at the top of the wall.
