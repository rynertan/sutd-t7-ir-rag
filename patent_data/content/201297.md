# Downhole memory gauge.

## Abstract
A downhole self contained memory gauge includes either a semiconductor or magnetic core memory for retaining down hole information related to sampled parameters, such as bore hole temperature and pressure. A microprocessor based com puter manages the power utilization by independently and selectably energizing and de energizing different sections of the gauge. The magnetic core memory is tested for operability, and the addressing of the magnetic core memory is adjusted in accordance with any inoperable memory locations. Samples of the monitored environmental conditions can be taken at vari able rates dependent upon software monitoring of the condi tion, the remaining battery life and the remaining memory capacity and in response to hardware monitored pressure changes. Each sample can be taken to a selectable resolution. A watchdog circuit monitors the microprocessor to ensure that it is operating within a preselected time limit.
