## Description
Luteinizing hormone LH and follicular stimulating hormone FSH are released from the anterior pituitary gland under the control of the releasing hormone LHRH produced in the hypothalamic region. LH and FSH act on the gonads to stimulate the synthesis of steroid hormones and to stimulate gamete maturation. The pulsatile release of LHRH, and thereby the release of LH and FSH, controls the reproductive cycle in domestic animals and humans. LHRH also affects the placenta, and the gonads indirectly, in causing the release of chorionic gonadotropin hCG . Antagonists of LHRH are useful for the control of fertility. Such antagonists block ovulation in the female and suppress spermatogenesis in the male. Related to these effects is a suppression of normal circulating levels of sexual steroids of gonadal origin, resulting in reduction in accessory organ weight and function in the male and the female. In domestic animals this effect promotes weight gain in a feed lot situation, stimulates abortion in pregnant animals and in general, acts as a chemical sterilant. The natural releasing hormone LHRH is a decapeptide comprised of naturally occurring amino acids which have the L configuration except for the achiral amino acid glycine . Its sequence is as follows Many analogs of this natural material have been studied and the very large majority of them have proven to be of insufficient biological activity to be clinically useful. Certain select modifications have proven to have an agonist effect on biological activity. By far the most significant enhancement is obtained by changing the 6 position residue from Gly to a In addition to agonists, analogs have been prepared which are competitive antagonists to LHRH all of which require deletion or replacement of the histidine residue at position 2 Vale. W., et al, It has also been shown that adding a modification at the 6 position, which, without the modification at position 2 results in the agonist activity cited above, enhances the antagonist activity of the 2 modified analogs, Beattie, C. W., et al, Against the background of these two major alterations, which result in a potent series of LHRH antagonists additional increments in antagonist activity may be had by modifying positions 1, 3 and or 10 in the already 2, 6 modified peptide. Coy, D. H., et al Since antagonists function by competing with LHRH for the appropriate receptors, high dosages of these compounds are required in order to block out the natural peptide. It is especially desirable, in view of this, to obtain antagonists with a very high degree of potency and prolonged activity. The ability to be slowly released from depot formulations will also be important. EP A 97 031 discloses nonapeptide and decapeptide analogs of LHRH which are useful as LHRH antagonists and have a structure similar to that of the compounds of the present invention, except for the amino acyl residue at position 6. D.H. Coy et al., Biochemistry, Vol. 14 9 , 1975, 1848 1851, describe C terminally fluorinated analogs of LHRH. The present invention refers to novel, highly potent nonapeptide and decapeptide analogs of LHRH in which a replacement at position 2, thus converting the peptide to the antagonist series is made more effective by replacement of the glycine residue at position 6 by a novel halo lower alkyl guanidino substituted amino acid residue which does not occur in nature. These compounds are potent LHRH antagonists. Other enhancements by substitutions at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and or 10 are also disclosed. The invention is also directed to various methods of use of these compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions therefor. A further aspect of the invention involves processes for the preparation of the novel compounds described above. The present invention relates to novel nonapeptide and decapeptide analogs of LHRH which have the formula and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein The present invention also comprises compounds of the formula and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein The replacement of the L histidyl residue which is at position 2 in LHRH with one of the residues herein specified is a requirement to convert the peptide to an LHRH antagonist. The replacement of the glycyl residue at position 6 in LHRH with one of the residues specified as F gives a dramatic enhancement of the antagonist effect. The substitutions disclosed herein at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 are further helpful in enhancing the antagonist activity. As set forth above, and for convenience in describing this invention, the conventional abbreviations for the various common amino acids are used as generally accepted in the peptide art as recommended by the IUPAC IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature, Certain other abbreviations will be useful in describing the invention. The present invention employs replacements by amino acids which do not occur in nature. Particularly commonly employed among these are the following As a further convenience, since the amino acid sequence of LHRH has been shown to be nona and decapeptides in which the amino acid residues at particular places in the sequence have been replaced by other amino acid residues or other moieties are abbreviated by showing the nature of the substitution, superscribed by the location, followed by LHRH as the parent. Thus, for example, the sequence, in which the Gly at position 6 has been replaced by D FDeh and the His at position 2 has been replaced by D p F Phe, is represented D p F Phe², D FDeh⁶ LHRH and the sequence is represented As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart any undesired toxicological effects.

Halo lower alkyl refers to a lower alkyl radical substituted with halo groups, especially those having one, two or three halo groups on the ω carbon. The halo group may be fluoro, chloro or bromo. This group is exemplified by trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl and the like. For the purpose of this invention the abbreviation alkylPro refers to cis 5 alkyl L prolyl residue wherein alkyl is the same as lower alkyl defined above. More specifically MePro is cis 5 methyl L Prolyl, EtPro is cis 5 ethyl L Prolyl and ButPro is cis 5 n butyl L Prolyl. The abbreviation N Ac refers specifically to the N acetyl amino acid residue in conformance with generally accepted nomenclature.

Particularly preferred salts are zinc salts, zinc tannate salts, pamoate salts, and the like. Another type of slow release depot formulation for injection would contain the compound or salt dispersed or encapsulated in a slow degrading, non toxic, non antigenic polymer such as a polylactic acid polyglycolic acid polymer for example as described in U.S. 3,773,919. The compounds or, preferably, relatively insoluble salts such as those described above may also be formulated in cholesterol matrix pellets, particularly for use in animals. Additional slow release, depot or implant formulations, e.g. liposomes, are well known in the literature. See, for example, The polypeptides of the present invention may be synthesized by any techniques that are known to those skilled in the peptide art. An excellent summary of the many techniques so available may be found in J.M. Stewart and J.D. Young, In general, these methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids or suitably protected amino acids to a growing peptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complimentary amino or carboxyl group suitably protected, under conditions suitable for forming the amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from this newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid suitably protected is then added, and so forth. After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, any remaining protecting groups and any solid support are removed sequentially or concurrently, to afford the final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling under conditions which do not racemize chiral centers a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after deprotection, a pentapeptide. A particularly preferred method of preparing compounds of the present invention involves solid phase peptide synthesis. In this particularly preferred method the α amino function of the amino acids is protected by an acid or base sensitive group while the side chain functional groups may be free or protected. Such protecting groups for the α amino function should have the properties of being stable to the conditions of peptide linkage formation, while being readily removable without destruction of the growing peptide chain or racemization of any of the chiral centers contained therein. Suitable protecting groups are Particularly preferred side chain protecting groups are, for arginine nitro, The C terminal amino acid is attached to a suitable solid support. Suitable solid supports useful for the above synthesis are those materials which are inert to the reagents and reaction conditions of the stepwise condensation deprotection reactions, as well as being insoluble in the media used. Suitable solid supports are chloromethylpolystyrene divinylbenzene polymer, hydroxymethyl polystyrene divinylbenzene polymer, and the like, especially chloromethyl polystyrene 1 divinylbenzene polymer. For the special case where the C terminus of the compound will be glycinamide, a particularly useful support is the benzhydrylamino polystyrene divinyl benzene polymer described by P. Rivaille, et al, At the end of the solid phase synthesis the fully protected polypeptide is removed from the resin. When the linkage to the resin support is of the benzyl ester type, cleavage is by means of aminolysis with an alkylamine or fluoroalkylamine for peptides with a proline C terminus, or by aminolysis with, for example, ammonia methanol or ammonia ethanol for peptides with a glycine C terminus at a temperature between about 10 and 50 C, preferably about 25 C, for between about 12 and 24 hours preferably about 18 hours. Alternatively, the peptide may be removed from the resin by transesterification, e.g., with methanol, followed by aminolysis. The protected peptide may be purified at this point by silica gel chromatography. The removal of the side chain protecting groups from the polypeptide is performed by treating the aminolysis product with, for example, anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride in the presence of anisole or other carbonium scavenger, treatment with hydrogen fluoride pyridine complex, treatment with tris trifluoroacetyl boron and trifluoroacetic acid, by reduction with hydrogen and palladium on carbon or polyvinylpyrrolidone, or by reduction with sodium in liquid ammonia, preferably with liquid hydrogen fluoride, and anisole at a temperature between about 10 and 10 C, preferably about 0 C, for between about 15 minutes and 1 hour, preferably about 30 minutes. For the glycine terminal peptides on the benzyhydrylamine resins, the resin cleavage and deprotection steps may be combined in a single step utilizing liquid hydrogen fluoride and anisole as described above. The fully deprotected polypeptide is then purified by a sequence of chromatographic steps employing any or all of the following types ion exchange on a weakly basic resin in the acetate form hydrophobic adsorption chromatography on underivatized polystyrene divinylbenzene for example Amberlite XAD silica gel adsorption chromatography ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose partition chromatography, e.g., on Sephadex G 25, or countercurrent distribution high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , especially reverse phase HPLC on octyl or octadecylsilyl silica bonded phase column packing. If a racemic amino acid is used in the 1, 2, 3 or 6 position, the diastereomeric nonapeptide or decapeptide final products are separated, and the desired peptide containing a The preparation of peptides having C terminal azaglycine amides is preferably done using classical peptide solution synthesis using known peptide intermediates. This is described in more detail in Example 3. Thus, in another aspect the present invention relates to a method for preparing compounds of the invention and of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which process comprises It will be appreciated that the novel halo lower alkyl guanidino substituted amino acids used in this invention to replace the glycine residue at position 6 of LHRH are useful intermediates and as such form an important part of this invention. Preferred intermediates include those of formula II wherein n is 3 or 4, R is trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl, 2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropyl or 3,3,3 trichloropropyl. Such intermediates of formula II may be prepared by two methods. One method follows classic peptide synthesis techniques. An ω amino α amino acid is treated with appropriate protecting groups in such a way that the acid function and the α amino group are protected but leaving the ω amino function available for further treatment. This protected compound is then reacted with N,N dialkylcarbodiimide in an appropriate solvent. The reaction is carried out at temperature between about 22 150 C for up to about 6 hours. The solvent is then removed. In order to remove the N,N dialkylurea by product, the residue is suspended in a second solvent such as dimethylformamide and the suspension filtered to recover the desired product as a solid. Alternatively, the corresponding N,N halodialkylthiourea may be reacted with the ω function of a suitably protected amino acid eg. CBZ Lys OBZ1 in the presence of HgCl₂. Alternatively, lysine dihydrochloride or appropriate homolog is reacted with an S methyl dialkyl isothiourea HI or the corresponding free base in the presence of a solution of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like. The reaction is best effected at from room temperature to 90 C, preferably 60 C over several days, i.e., 2 6 days at a pH of ca. 10.5. Additional thiourea may be added if needed after the initial reaction period. A dialkyl dicarbonate and base such as magnesium oxide is then added in an organic solvent, such as dioxane, to react with the α amino function of the product and the α,ω functions of excess starting material. The reaction product is then worked up by extraction, an ion exchange resin treatment and other appropriate chromatographic means. The following examples illustrate the preparation of compounds within the scope of this invention. A mixture of 17.5g NaHCO₃, 125ml methylene chloride and 2.65 ml thiophosgene was cooled to 0 C and a solution of 9.4g of CF₃CH₂NH₂.HCl in 50ml of water was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stored at 0 for 2 hr. and then at room temperature overnight. The mixture was partitioned between methylene chloride and water. The methylene chloride layer was drie over magnesium sulfate. The methylene chloride solution was filtered and concentrated to an oil. The oil was crystallized from ethyl acetate hexane to yield 6.5g of N,N bis 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl thiourea of mp. 154 5 C. A solution of 3.36 g of the above thiourea in 10 ml of methanol was treated with 0.96 ml of CH₃I. The reaction mixture was heated at 70 C for 1 hr. An additional 0.96 ml of CH₃I was added and stirring was continued for 2 hr. at 70 C, then overnight at room temperature.

To a solution of 2.8 g of S 2 benzyloxycarbonylamino 5 oxohexanamide from the preceeding paragraph in a mixture of 60 ml of methanol and 7.5 ml of glacial acetic acid is added, under nitrogen, 1.5 g of palladium diacetate. This reaction mixture is hydrogenated under atmospheric pressure for 4 hrs, at which time a thin layer chromatographic analysis shows the reaction had gone to completion. The reaction mixture is then filtered through Celite and washed with methanol. The reaction mixture and washings are concentrated to dryness to give 1.7 g of a yellow oil, which is treated with 1 ml of a mixture of hydrochloric acid and ethyl acetate to produce the hydrochloride salt. This oil is triturated with methanol ethyl ether to produce 1.3 g of a yellow solid mp 174 176 C α 25 D 33 c 0.96, CH₃OH .

After 18 hours of drying under high vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 150 ml. dry DMF. 25 g chloromethylated polystyrene 1 divinylbenzene Merrifield resin corresponding to 25 mmole chloride was added. The mixture was shaken at 50 C for 24 hours, filtered, and the resin was then washed sequentially with DMF, water, and ethanol. The resin was dried under vacuum for 3 days to yield 28.34 g of Boc Gly O Resin. In the reaction vessel of a Beckman 990 Peptide Synthesizer was placed 0.5 g. 0.5 mmol. of benzhydrylamine resin Beckman . Amino acids were added sequentially to this resin by means of a synthesis program, as follows Steps 1 13 complete a coupling cycle for one amino acid and completeness of the reaction is checked by the ninhydrin method of E. Kaiser, The resin was coupled sequentially with a 2.0 to 2.5 molar excess of each protected amino acid and DCC with or without additions such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazol HBT . Thus, the resin was treated during successive coupling cycles with 0.237 g of Boc D Ala OH and 0.155 g of BTH The resin was removed from the reaction vessel, washed with CH₂Cl₂, and dried as its HF salt, was washed with ether. The residue was then extracted with glacial acetic acid. The acetic acid extract was lyophilized to yield the crude material. The crude material was converted to the acetate salt by passage in water through a column of AG3X a weakly basic tertiary amine resin which had been converted to the acetate form. Lyophilization of the eluate yielded 0.6 g. of the crude peptide acetate salt as a white solid.

For example, the following approach may be used wherein AzaGlyNH₂ is NH NH CONH₂, to prepare the peptide as the free peptide or salt. The coupling of the individual fragments may proceed by the acyl azide method J. Honzel, et al, Often, the fragments coupled in this way will be peptides or amino acids. Alternatively, the N terminal nonapeptide acid may be prepared by the solid phase or solution method and subsequently coupled to semicarbazide HCl by the dicyclohexylcarbodiimidehydroxybenzotriazole or other coupling method. The resultant suspension was diluted with 1 ml water and the precipitate was centrifuged.
