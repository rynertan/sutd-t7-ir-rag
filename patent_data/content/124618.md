## Description
SPECIFICATION Cephalosporin derivatives, methods for production thereof and compositions for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infectionTECHNICAL FIELD 4. This invention relates to cephalosporin derivatives.BACKGROUND ART Cephalosporins are in general poorly absorbed through the digestive tract and, thus, administered with an injection. For example, the cephalosporin of the formula EMI1.1 has excellent antibacterial activities, but due to its poor absorbability through the digestive tract, it is administered with an injection. As a result of extensive research to obtain orally administrable cephalosporin preparations, the present inventors have completed this invention, on the basis of the findings that the cephalosporin derivatives I mentioned below are of good absorbability through the digestive tract and are rapidly after absorption, hydrolyzed in vivo under the action of enzymes, whereby the ester moiety of the substituent in the 4 position of the cephem ring structure is hydrolyzed and cephalosporin derivatives I are thereby converted to the corresponding unesterified species, namely, cephalosporins of the above formula II hereinafter referred to as unesterfied species 11 ., that is, that oral administration of cephalosporin derivatives I results in high blood levels over prolonged period of the unesterified species that have excellent antibacterial activitiesDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION This invention relates to cephalosporin derivatives of the general formula EMI2.1 1 1 wherein R represents CH20CORa wherein R represents an alkyl a group ,EMI2.2 wherein R1 represents an alkyl group, b EMI2.3 wherein R represents an alkyl group , c EMI2.4 or phthalidyl group. In this specification, an alkyl group means concept including both a straight one and branched one, preferably having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso propyl, butyl, iso butyl, t butyl and the like. Cephalosporin derivatives I can be prepared, for instance, by the following method. Namely, they can be prepared by reacting an unesterified species II with a compound of the general formula III R OH III wherein R is as defined above. Unesterified species II and compound III . may be subjected to the reaction directly as they are, but preferably it is convenient that one of the unesterified species II and compound III is converted or both of them are converted to a reactive derivative thereof and then the reaction is carried out. The reactive derivatives of unesterified species II mean those on the carboxyl group and such reactive derivatives are exemplified by those which are generally used for esterification.Namely, as such reactive derivatives, there may be used such mineral salts as alkali metal salts e.g. sodium salt and potassium salt and such organic salts as organic amine salts e.g. triethylamine salt . As examples of the reactive derivatives of compound III , there may be mentioned alkyl or arylsulfonic acid esters such as methane sulfonic acid ester and p toluenesulfonic acid ester, diesters of sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid, alkyl or arylchloroformate e.g. ethylchloroformate, phenylchloroformate , alkyloxy or aryloxysulfenic acid ester, alkyloxy or aryloxysulfonic aicd ester, and halides which are derived by substituting hydroxy group of compound III by a halogen such as chlorine, bromine, iodine.It is preferred to react, for example, a salt of the unesterified species II with halide of compound III at room temperature or, if necessary, under cooling for preventing formation of byproduct of A2 isorner. The present reaction can be carried out readily in the presence of a solvent which does not interfere with the reaction, such as dimethylformamide dimethylacetamide, hexamethyl phosphorictriamide, acetone, acetonitrile and the l ike. Further, cephalosporin derivatives I can be prepared by reacting a compound of the general formula EMI4.1 wherein A represents amino group or a protected amino group, with a compound III in the same manner as the above mentioned esterification, followed, in the case where A is a protected amino group, by removal of the protective group c the obtained esterified compound by a conventional method, and further acylating the amino group in the 7 position of the derived esterified compound of the general formula EMI4.2 wherein R has the same meaning as above, with a compound of the formula EMI5.1 Referring to the above general formula IV , in the case where A is a protected amino, as the protective group, there may be used any of per se known ones in the cephalosporin field.When the protective group is amino containing group, it is preferable that the amino group in the amino containing group is, in carrying out the reaction, protected. Such protective groups for the amino group, may be suitably selected from among per se known protective groups for amino group such as benzylcarbonyl, 2 thienylacetyl, 5 amino 5 carbaoxyvaleryl, t butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, trityl, phthalimide group.The hydroxy group of compound VI may be, in carrying out the reaction, protected. As examples of the protective groups therefor, there may be mentioned formyl group, silyl group, dichloroacetyl group and the like. Compound VI is used in the free carboxylic acid form or in the form of a reactive derivative thereof. Thus, it is submitted to the acylation reaction in the form of a free acid.pr reactive derivative, for example, a sodium, potassium, calcium, trimethylamine or pyridine salt, an acid halide, an acid anhydride, a mixed acid anhydride, a cyclic carboxy anhydride, a reactive amide or ester, and the like. In cases where compound VI is used in the free acid or salt form, the use of an adequate condensing agent is preferable and usable condensing agents are, for example, such dehydrating agents as N,N disubstituted carbodiimides e.g. N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and azolide compounds e.g. N,N carbonylimidazole, N,N thionyldiimidazole . When such a condensing agent is used, the reaction presumably proceed via a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid. The cephalosporin derivatives I can be isolated and purified by a per se known method. By diluting the thus produced cephalosporin derivatives I with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient by a per se known means, the orally administrable therapeutic preparations for the prevention and treatment of bacterially infections diseases can be prepared. The dilution is carried out by a per se known means such as mixing or the like. As examples of the carrier or excipient, there may be mentioned starch, lactose, sugar, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. If desired, other additives may be further added to said orally administrable pharmaceutical preparations for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infection. Preferred additives are, for instance, binders e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone, starch, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, crystalline cellulose , lubricant e.g. magnesium stearate, talc and disintegrators e.g. calcium carboxymethylcellulose, talc and the like . After mixing the ingredients, the mixture can be formed into dosage forms suited for oral administration, such as capsules, powder, fine granules, granules, and dry syrup, by per se known means. Cephalosporin derivatives I according to the invention can be rapidly absorbed through the digestive tract and are rapidly after absorption, hydrolyzed in vivo under the action of enzymes to be converted into the corresponding unesterified species or salts thereof. Such unesterified species 11 and salts thereof have excellent antibacterial activities. Thus, they exhibit excellent activity against such gram positive bacteria asStaphylococcus aureus and such gram negative bacteria asEscherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris,Proteus mirabillis, Proteus morganu. In addition, the unesterified species have very low toxicity. Therefore, cephalosporin derivatives I according to the present invention can be used as therapeutic agents, for example, for bacteria caused diseases e.g. suppurative diseases, respiratory tract infection, biliary tract infection, urinary tract infection in warm blooded aminals including humans e.g. dog, cat, cattle, horse, rat, mouse . The dose of cephalosporin derivatives I varies depending upon, host to be administered to , severity of symtom and other factors. In treating suppurative diseases in human adults, for instance, cephalosporin derivatives I are administered orally at a dose of about 1 20 mg as the corresponding unesterified species per kg body weight three or four times a day. Furthermore, cephalosporin derivatives according to this invention are also useful as intermediates for synthesizing such cephalosporin derivatives, for example, as disclosed in the specification of PCT P82 00437 Example 1 Preparation of acetoxymethyl 7 D mandelamidoj 3 5 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 2 yl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate In 45 ml of dimethylformamide was dessolved 1.5 g of potassium salt of 7 D mandelamido 3 5 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 2 yl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid and the solution was cooled to 200C, whereto 612 mg of iodomethylacetate was added under stirring.The mixture was allowed to react at the same temperature for 30 mixture and, following addition of 200 mg of ethyl acetate thereto, washed with ice water 100 ml x 3 and then with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution 100 ml x 2 , and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
