# PARK LOCK DEVICE FOR USE WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is an improved arrangement of a park lock device for use with an automatic transmission, by which the transmission casing can be constructed simple and com pact in size. The park lock device comprises a parking gear se cured to the output shaft of the transmission to rotate there with a parking pawl pivotally connected to the casing to lock and unlock the parking gear, the pawl including first and sec ond wing portions which extend in the opposed directions from the pivoted portion of the pawl, the first wing portion be ing formed with a tooth lockably engageable with a teeth gap of the parking gear and an actuating mechanism having a cam member which is slidably engageable with the second wing portion to pivot the parking pawl in a direction to achieve the locking engagement between the tooth of the parking pawl and the teeth gap of the parking gear. The actuating mechan ism is positioned essentially inboard of the parking pawl with respect to the transmission casing.
