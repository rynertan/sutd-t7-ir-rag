## Description
DISPENSER FOR LINER WOUND TAPE III L lltiorl relates to dispensers for use with pressure sensitive adhesive coated rolls of tape convolutely wound with a release liner between its coils, lurid in particular to such dispensers which permit withdrawiny the tape while effecting automatic removal and storage of the liner within the dispenser. Pressure sensitive adhesive coated tape packaged with a release liner to protect the adhesive surface is commonly provided in either roll form or in flat pre cut lengths. Where such tape must be kept sterile, as for medical use, the tape is commonly supplied in flat pre cut lengths. Such pre cut lengths, however, may not always be the desired length for use in a particular situation, and the liner must be manually peeled from the pre cut tape tenths, and disposed of, which is a particular disadvan Laze when the tape is used in an operating room. Dispensers foc rolls of such tape which may be readily manufactured in a sterile condition are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,274,038 3,839,127 3,468,743 and 3,283,886. Although tI t2 diensers described in these patents may dispense any IiLh. of the tape and separate the liner from the tape, tiI .y discharge the separated liner from the dispenser wl il faust be manually severed and discarded. Diswhere pensers which remove and store the liner on the dispenser as the ttip is withdrawn from the dispenser are shown in z.B. Palent Nos. 4,151,039 3,509,000 and 3,339, 97. Thung dispensers inelude a liner take up mechanism iitcLudity a take up roll or spindle on which the liner is wound, tether with a means for rotating the linerLuke up roll as the tape is dispensed. Such mechanisms m.k. L 2.C known dispensers structurally complex, however, sa that they are difficult to adapt for use as a hand heldHispenser, and are too expensive to be made disposable.Alsp, for medical use, these dispensers are too bulky for convenient sterile treatment either initially or to afford re loadiny of the dispenser with tape. Mie present invention provides a simple hand held dispenser for pressure sensitive adhesive coated tape wound with a release liner between its coils, in which the motion of the tape as it is withdrawn simultaneously separates the liner from the tape and winds the liner in stored condition on the dispenser without the need for a liner tdke up mechanism. The dispenser is simple, sufficiently inexpensive to manufacture that it may be disposed of after a single roll of tape has been dispensed from it, and can be readily sterilized when used with tape for medical applications. A dispenser according to the present invention comprises walls defining a first cavity for storing a supply roll of the tape, a second cavity partially defined by an inner wall surface which wall surface will cause liner pushed into the second cavity to wind into a coil, a tape outlet opening through which tape may be withdrawn from the dispenser, and a path including a first portion connecting the first cavity and the tape outlet adapted to tjuide the tape through the opening, for connecting the t vities to guide the liner from the first cavity into the ond cavity, and for separating the liner from the tape being withdrawn, so that tape being withdrawn propels the iner along the path means and into the second cavity. The walls defining the dispenser may include a separating edge transverse of the path means so that the lung is peeled away from the liner around the separating edge as us tape is withdrawn from the dispenser, and the simultaneously pushed along the path means and into the second cavity where contact with the inner surface will cause it to wind into a coil. The walls defining the dispenser may include a t e supporting surface projecting away from the path on tIx side of the opening opposite the separating edge, which tape supporting surface engages the portion of tape projecting outside the dispenser when the tape is not being withdrawn to present it in an easily accessible Run for giasping by a subsequent user. The dispenser may also provide means for affording the manual application of tension to the tape as it is witIdrawn from the dispenser which can be useful in applying the tape to a surface. Such means may comprise a gap in the walls along the path between the first cavity and the opening through which gap a user may manually engage and press tape being withdrawn against the opposite wall of the path. Preferably, the dispenser also includes tape cutting means which may be in the form of a blade having a concave cutting edge mounted externally on the dispenser to afford transversely severing the tape. Such a curved blade first cuts the two opposite outside edges of the tape, and then progressively cuts across the tape towards its center as the tape is pulled into engagement with the concave cutting edge to facilitate ease of cutting the tape. The present invention will be further described with respect to the accompanying drawing wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views und wherein figure I is a perspective view of a first umchliment of a hand held tape dispenser according to the present invention shown during use to apply a length of Co cr surface figure 2 is a longitudinal section view of theHispenser of Figure 1 having inserted therein a roll of ullunive coated tape convolutely wound with a release I inner Figure 3 is a sectional view taken approximately .iItiy line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is an end view of the dispenser ofFigure 1 Figure 5 is an enlarged fragmentary sectional view of the dispenser of Figure 1 without the tape and hach, ahowung the opening where lape is removed from the dispenser Figure 6 is a longitudinal section view of a second embodiment of a dispenser according to the present invention Figure 7 is an end view of the dispenser of Figure 6 Figure 8 is a longitudinal section of a third embodiment of a dispenser according to this invention and figure 9 is an end view of the dispenser ofFigure 8. Referring now to Figures 1 through 5 of the drawings, there is illustrated a first embodiment of a tape dispenser according to the present invention generally designated by the reference numeral 10. The dispenser 10 is adapted to be hand held andEd contain a supply roll 14 Figure 2 of pressuresensitive adhesive coated tape 12 convolutely wound with aPetease liner 16 between coils, from which lengths of the lape 12 lllay be manually withdrawn through an opening 26 inThe dispenser 10. The dispenser comprises walls 18 which define a ii generally cylindrical cavity 20 adapted for storing Ilit upply roll 14 a path means or path 22 having a first pertion if connecting the first cavity 20 and opening 26 thrungh which the tape 12 and liner 16 may be pulled from liii. Supply roll 14 the opening 26 through which the ta e It itay I.e manually withdrawn from the dispenser 10, a separating chat edge 24 positioned traverse of the path 22 so t s the tape 12 is pulled around the separating edge 24 Lisrough the opening 26 it will be peeled from the liner 16, while the motion of the tape 12 will simultaneously its the separated liner 16 away from the separating edge 24 along a second portion 25 of the path 22 and a second generally cylindrical cavity 30 having an arcuate inner will Surface wtaich is intersected generally at a tangent by the second portion 25 of the path 22, such that they 16 puschen dlong the seeond portion 25 of path 22 will strike the arcuate inner wall surface 28 and cause tile Liner 16 to wind into a coil in the second cavity 30. lithe curl formed in the liner 16 when it is wound with the tape in the supply roll 14 helps to cause the liner 16 to wind into a coil in the second cavity 30, since in the dispenser 10 the cavities 20 and 30 are positioned on the same side of the path 22. The dispenser walls 18 are preferably molded of a stiff polymeric material such as high impact polystyrene. The walls 18 comprise first and second planar generally teardrop shaped side walls 27 and 29 having generally pointed end portions.The first side wall 27 has molded thereon a plurality of traverse walls 31 projecting a uniform distance normal to one major surface of the first side wall 27, and the second side wall 29 is adopted to be fastened to the distal ends of tile transverse walls 31 after the supply roll 14 of the t.lj L 12 has been positioned in the dispenser 10 to position the second side wall 29 in opposed parallel relationship to the first side wall 27 so that arcuate portions of the transverse walls 31 and opposed generally eirchlar portions of the side walls 27 and 29 define the generally cylindrical first and second cavities, and apposed narrow portions of the side walls 27 and 29 and z tiots of the traverse walls 31 define the path 22. The I hit csvity 20 and opening 26 are located adjacent the of uneraily 29, pointed end portions of the side walls 27 and cavity whereas the second cavity 30, because of its size wisicis is substantially larger in diameter than the first t Vity 20 to facilitate coiling of the liner 16 is J at the end of the dispenser 10 opposite the generally pointed end portions of the side walls 27 and 2. . The resultant shape allows the larger portion of the dispenser adjacent the larger second cavity 30 to be comfortably received in the palm of a users hand with the narrower end portion of the dispenser pointed away from his hund to altord easy access to and manipulation of Lape 12 extending through the opening 26. The traverse walls 31 further include a project iitj wall defining a tape supporting surface 32 located on the side of the opening 26 opposite the separating edge 24, which supporting surface 32 is disposed at an angle with respect to the path 22 such that the portion of the tape 12 projecting out of the opening 26 will be biased into engagement with the supporting surface 32 by resiliency in the portion of the tape 12 that is peeled away from the liner 16 at the opening 26 which resiliency causes the tape 12 to move toward a position parallel to the first portion of the path .This resiliency will cause the tape 12 to press against and be supported by the tape supporting surface 32 in a position projecting away from the dispenser when tape 12 is not being withdrawn from the dispenser. The tape 12 so supported on the tape supporting surface 32 may be easily grasped by a subsequent user 0 the dispenser 10. Means are provided for affording the manual pplication of tension to the tape 12 as the tape 12 is withdrawn, which is useful when affixing the tape 12 to a surlace or severing tape via tape cutting means later to ill explained. A yap ine 4 is defined by the walls 1U between t first cavity 20 and the opening 26 along the first portion 23 of the path 22, which gap 34 allows the user to munnlly engage the outer surface of the tape 12 and press the tape 12 and liner 16 against an arcuate portion 35 of t verse walls 31 on the side of the first portion 23 of the path 22 opposite the gap 34 as the tape is being withdrawn through the opening 24. The user may thus control the amount of tension in the tape 12 being applied I.y controlling the pressure manually applied to press the tape 12 against the wall portion 35. The dispenser 10 includes tape cutting means for dcutting the tape 12 when a desired length has been Withil wn. The Lupe cutting meuns comprises a blade 36 having a concave cutting edge 38 mounted on the dispenser 10 to permit transverse severing of the tape 12 after it liars been pulled through the opening 26. The blade 36 is mounted perpendicularly between the opposing surfaces of outwardly projecting parts 40 of the generally pointed end portions of the two parallel side walls 27 and 29.After a desired length of the tape 12 has been pulled from the onion 26, the dispenser may be pivoted to move the blade 36 between the projecting parts 40 toward the tape after movesnent of tape out of the dispenser is stopped by manually pressing the tape against the wall portion 35 through the opening 24. As the concave cutting edge 38 is noved into engagement with the tape 12, the tape 12 will be severed transversely from its opposite outside edges progressively towards its center to facilitate ease of severing of the tape 12. For operation, the supply roll 14 is loaded into the first cavity 20 and the tape 12 and liner 16 are separated adjacent their ends and threaded along the first portion 23 of the path with the separated end of the tape 1,2 projecting out of the opening 26 and the separated end .L Iic liner 16 in the second portion 25 of the path 22 ending to the second cavity 30. The e dispenser 10 is then closed by attachment of the second side wall 29, whereupon user may grasp the dispenser 10 with one hand, and grasp und iuii out the desired length of tape 12 with the other hind. As the tape 12 is pulled out of the dispenser 10, tilt. liner 16 is separated at the separating edge 24 and is pushed along the second portion 25 of the path 22 into the second cavity 30 where contact with the arcuate wall surface 2U causes it to form a coil. The second side wall may be releasably attached to the transverse walls 31 as by screws or hooks so that when the tape 12 has all been dispensed the liner 16 may be removed from the second cavity JO and d new suply roll 14 loaded into the first cavity 20 and threaded along the path 22. Alternatively,Decause dispenser 10 is simple, it may be economically manufactured so that the second side wall 29 is not removable and the dispenser is disposed of after a single roll of tape 12 is dispensed.Also in either form since the dispenser 10 is compact and simple in structure, the dispenser may be readily sterilized prior to use. Referring to Figures 6 and 7 of the drawings, there is illustrated a second embodiment of a tape dispenser according to the present invention generally designated by the reference numeral 50. The dispenser 50 comprises walls 52 which define a first generally cylindrical cavity 54 adapted for storing a supply roll of tape convolutely wound with a release liner between its coils a path means or path 56 comprising a first portion 57 connecting the first cavity 54 with an outlet opening 58 through which tape may be manually withdrawn from a supply roll not shown in the iirst cavity 54 a separating edge 60 positioned traverse t the path 54 at the juncture between the first cavity 54 und the first path portion 57 so that as the tape is pulled around the separating edge 60 along the first path r tion 57 and through the opening 58 it will be peeled trom the liner while the motion of the tape will simultuneously push the separated liner away from the separating edge 60 along a second portion 61 of the path it, wisicts connects to the first cavity 54 and extends in a tIictson opposite the first path portion 57j and a second generally cylindrical cavity 62 having an arcuate inner wilL RTI ID 8.16 sufe 64 which is intersected generally at a tangent by the second portion 61 of the path 56, such that I LIler pushed along the second path portion 61 into the second cavity 62 will strike the arcuate inner wall u àce 64 and cause the liner to wind into a coil in the second cavity 62. Like Use dispenser 10, the dispenser 50 includes a tape cutting means for cutting the tape when a desired ength has been withdrawn, comprieing a blade 66 having a concave cutting edge 68 mounted on the dispenser 50 between projecting opposed parts 70 of planar generally teardrop shaped side walls of the dispenser 50 to permit transverse severing of the tape after it has been pulled through the opening 58. Unlike the dispenser 10, however, the dispenser 50 further includes a means for pressing the tape as it is withdrawn through the opening 58, comprising an outer arcuate surface 59 defined by the walls 52. Referring to Figures 8 and 9 of the drawings, there is illustrated a third embodiment of a tape dispenser according to the present invention generally designated by the reference numeral 80. The dispenser 80 comprises walls 82 which define d first generally cylindrical cavity 84 adapted for storin a supply roll of tape convolutely wound with a release liner between its coils a second generally ylindrical cavity 92 having an arcuate inner wall surface 4 adapted to direct liner pushed into the second cavity 2 to wind into a coil a tape outlet opening 88 through wliicli tape may be withdrawn from the dispenser 80 and a 92 pach means or path 86 including a first portion 87 for connecting the first cavity 84 and the opening 88 to guide t.LI L in withdrawn from the dispenser 80 through the opuning eavities us, and a second portion 91 for connecting the ,vit 4 and 92 to guide liner from the first cavity U4 itti tise second cavity 92 where the liner will strike the llliitL wall surface 94 of the second cavity 92 which will cause the liner to wind into a coil.The path portions 87 and 91 diverge at an edge 90 which divergence and not the t.titje 90 provides means for separating the liner from tape being withdrawn through the path portion, 87 so that tape being withdrawn will propel the liner along the path portion 91 and into the second cavity 92. The use of such divergent path portions 87 and 91 works well to separate tape and liner where the liner has sufficient stiffness und the pressure sensilive adhesive on the tape does not adhere too aggressively to the liner. Where the liner is not sufficiently stiff or the adhesive is too aggressive, tise liner can fold and follow the tape out the path portion 87.It has been found that separating a tape from a liner by peeling the tape away from the liner around an dge, such as is done around the edges 24 and 60 in the dispensers 10 and 50 respectively, affords dispensing tape wound on liner having less stiffness or tape having more aggressive adhesive than does separating the tape from the liner via diverging paths. Like the dispenser 50, the dispenser 80 includes a means for pressing the tape as it is withdrawn through the opening 88, comprising an outer arcuate surface 89 defined by the walls 82. The present invention has now been described with reference to three embodiments thereof, and it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that many changes can be made in the shapes and features of the dispenser illustrated without departing from the spirit of tise invention.For example, in the dispenser 50 of Figure te the path portions 57 and 61 can be separated so that tise path portion 57 communicates with the cavity 54 at a position spaced from the position at which the path z t,X tion 61 communicates with the first cavity 54 such as is illustrated by the dotted lines 99 so that the liner hter it is separated from the tape moves a short distance a long the inner surface of the cavity 54 and then along tlie second path portion 61 into the second cavity 62. Alu, with the general shape of the dispenser 50 as 1iustrated, the supply roll of tape may be loaded into the cavity 62 and the liner collected in the cavity 54 as the tape is pulled along the path 56 and. through the outlet opening 5U, preferably after the relative size of the cavities 62 and 54 has been reversed. Thus, the scope of the present invention should not be limited by the structures of the dispensers deseribed, but only by the tungunge of the dopendent elaims.
