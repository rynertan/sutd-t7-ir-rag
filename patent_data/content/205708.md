# PRODUCTION OF POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE BY ION EXCHANGE

## Abstract
A process for producing potassium phosphates by ion exchange using an Advanced Separation Device ASD is carried out by supplying a phosphate salt solution, a wash ing solution and a potassium salt regeneration solution to respective fixed feed ports 12 in periodic fluid communica tion with a plurality of resin filled chambers 14 moving about a circular path. Passage of the phosphate salt solution through potassium loaded resin forms potassium phosphat es and cation loaded resin by ion exchange. After washing out residual salts, the cation loaded resin is regenerated by adding a potassium salt which loads the resin with potas sium and strips it of the cation in the form of a soluble cation salt. By virtue of the ASD, potassium phosphate may be produced continuously and with greater efficiency than is possible with conventional ion exchange processes since the potassium salt and phosphate salt feed solutions may be fortified in an intra stage fashion, i.e. during the course of the ion exchange or regeneration stages. In similar fash ion, the pH may be adjusted in an intra stage fashion.
