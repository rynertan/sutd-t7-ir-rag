# High speed diode.

## Abstract
A high speed diode with a PNN structure has a break down voltage of about 200 V, a forward voltage drop of 0.9 V or less, a reverse recovery time of 50 nsec or less, and a soft recovery characteristic, by making the impurity concentration in the surface of a P layer 4 equal to or less than 8 x 10¹⁸ atoms cc, putting the thickness of the P layer 4 in a range from 2 to 6 µm, putting the resistivity of an N layer 2 in a range from 5 to 12Ω cm, putting the thickness of the N layer 2 in a range from 19 to 25 µm, and putting the carrier lifetime in the N layer in a range from 20 to 40 nsec.
