## Description
For MODIFIED THERMOPLASTIC POLYESTER MOLDING COMPOSITIONS AND ARTICLES MOLDED THEREFROM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to modified Whernoplastic poly C2 6alkylene terephthalate holding compositions which in preferred instances provide molded articles possessing improved impact resistance, lower specific gravity improved resistance to distortion under load, and improved surface appearance. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions of a a C26 alkylene terephthalate resin, and a ajor proportion of b an aromatic polycarbonate resin combined with c a polyolefin or an olefin copolymer. The invention includes articles molded from the composition. High molecular weight linear polyesters of C2 4 glycols with terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid and ormer similar dibasic acids have been available for many years. Certain of these are described in Whinfield et al.U.S. Patent 2,465,319, and in Pengilly, U.S. Patent 3,047,51 incorporated herein by reference. With the development of molecular weight.control, the use of nucleating agents and two step molding cycles polyethylene terephthalate and, in general, the poly C2 6alkylene terephthalate resins have become important constituents of injection moldable compositions. Poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , because of its very rapid crystallization from the melt, is uniquely useful as a component of such compositions.Workpieces molded from such polyester resins, alone or combined with reinforcements, in comparison with other thermoplastics possess a high degree of surface hardness, abrasion resistance and gloss, and a low degree of surface friction. Stable polyblends of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate can be molded into useful unreinforced and reinforced aricles. See Fox andWambach U.S. 3,953,394, incorporated herein by rererence. Block copolyesters containing units derived from poly l,4 butylene terephthalate and from an aromatic aliphatic or aliphatic polyester are also known. See copending application U.S. Serial No. 752,325, filed Decem ber 20, 1976, incorporated herein by reference. Such block copolyesters are useful alone as holding resins and also in intimate combination with poly l,4 butylene terephthalate and or polyethylene terephthalate. Polycarbonates are known to be admixable with various polyesters, including poly alkylene terephthalates . Such blends are often ore cost effective than the polycarbonate alone Compositions of polycarbonate resins and polyester are disciosed, for instance, n L .S. PatenNo. 3,486,428 Nakamura, et al. . Bussink et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,267,096 disclose compositions comprising a selectively hydrogenated elastomeric block copolymer, a polycarbonate and an amorphous polyester. These compositions are described as having improved melt flow and resistance to brittle failure and environmental stress cracking. Dieck et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,220,735 disclose thermoplastic compositions of poly l,4butylene terephthalate resin in combination with poly ethylene terephthalate and or a polyester Co polymer and 2 modifier comprising both a selectively hydrogenated onoalKenyl arene diene block copolymer and an aromatic polycarbonate. It has been proposed to increase the impact strengths of such polyesters by adding modifiers. For example, Brinkmann et al. in U.S. 3,591,659 disclose tht a useful family of modifiers comprises polyalkyl acrylates, methacrvlates and or ethacrylates. Baron et al.in U.S. 4,044,073 disclose that a useful impact modifier for such polyesters is an aromatic polycarbonate.Schlichting et al. in U.S. 4,022,748 disclose that a rubber eiastic graft co polymer having a glass temperature below 20 C. is a useful modifier. Lane, U.S. 4,034,013 and Farnham et al., U.S. 4,096,202 disclose that useful impact modifiers comprise multiple stage polymers having a rubbery first stage and a hard final stage, preferably including units derived from alkyl acrylates, especially the butyl acrylates Baron et al. in U.S. 4,034,016 disclose an impact modifier combination compris g a blend of polyurethane and an aromatic polycarbonate.Co pending application Serial No. 870,679, filed January 19, 1978, discloses an impac odifier combination comprising a segmented bloc copolyester and an aromatic polycarbonate. and Cohen et al. co pending application Serial No. 957,801 discloses combinations of polyarylate resins and aromatic polycarbonate resins for the purpose. Reinforced, filled and or flame retardant modifications of such polyesters are also well kr,own in the art. It has now been discovered that molding compositions comprising a minor amount of poly C2 6alkylene terephthalate resin including copolyesters thereof, provide moldings of improved impact resistance, flexural and tensile strength and resistance to distortion at elevated temperature under load, as well as lower specific gravity and improved surface appearance, when the compositions include an intimate admixture of a polycarbonate resin and a poly olefinic or olefin copolymer resin. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention provides thenmoplastic molding compositions comprising a a minor amount of a poly C2 6 alkylene terephthalate resin and a major proportion of b an aromatic polycarbonate resin in combination with c a polyolefin or an olefin copolymer, the amount oz b and c being effective to increase the impact strength of articles molded from said resins a and b . The polyester resins a of the composition of the present invention are available commercially They can be prepared by known methods such as the alcoholysis of dimethyl terephthalate with an appropriate diol for example, ethylene glycdl and 1,4 butanediol followed by polymerization, or by reacting the acid or its mono or di halide with. an appropriate diol or mixture of diols.Copolyesters can be prepared in similar manner by replace men of parts of the terephthalate component with another suitable acid component, for example,isophthalic acid.Suitable methods are described in U.S. 2,465,319 and U.S.3,047,539. Illustratively, suitable high molecular weight polyesters have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.2 deciliter per gram and preferably a least 0.4 up to 1.5 deciliters per gram as measured in a 60 40 phenol tetrach loroethane mixture at 30 C. for poly ethylene tere phthalate . As explained, the compositions of te invention will also contain a poly ethylene terephthalate resin as tne only polyester in the compositions. Especially preferret is poly ethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.2, and more usually from 0.4 to 1.5 deciliters per gram measured in solution in 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane at 25 to 30 C. Procedures for preparing the poly ethylene terephthalate are known to those skilled in the art.The descriptions in U.S. Patent No. 2,465,319 toWhinfield, et al. and U.S. Patent No. 3,047,539 toPengilly are helpful. The addition polymer, component c , can be any normally thermoplastic polyolefin or olefin copolymeSuitable polymers are the commercial low density poly ethylenes for example, USI Chemicals Microthene FM 510 . rubbery copolymers of ethylene and propylene Epcar 306 G copolymers of ethylene and methyl acrylate Gulf s EMA 220 and EPDM Nordel 1560 from E.I. DuPont de Nemours . The aromatic polycarbonate resins which are suitable for use as component D are well known, anc many suitable resins of this group are disclosed inEncyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 10 pages 710 727, 1969 Interscience, New York and in Baron et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,034,016, all incorporated herein by reference.The polycarbonates are produced by reaction of a suitable dihydric phenol compound with phosgene. the reaction is continued until a polycarbonate resin is formedBecause of its ready availability, the ease with which it reacts with phosgene and the very satisfactory properties which it provides in polymerized form, bisphenol A is preferred as the starting dihydric phenol compound. A suitable aromatic polycarbonate is available under the trademarkLEXAN from General Electric Co. Among the preferred features the composition is formulated to contain from about 51 to about 97 parts by weight of b , from about 3 to about 49 parts by weight of a , and from about 3 to about 20 parts by weight of c . In preferred embodiments the composition in cludes reinforcing fillers such as fibrous filamentous glass and or graphite mineral fillers such as mica, talc and the like, and preferably, clay. The filamentous glass suitable for use as reinforcement in such embodiments is well known to those skilled in the art and is available from a number of manufacturers. Examples include filaments of a lime aluminum boro silicate glass that is substantially soda free, known as E glass and low soda glass knownas C glass. These can be untreated or treated with silane. The amount of the filler varies widelv depending on the strength specifications which are to be met, it being essential only that an amount is employed which is at least sufficient to provide some reinforcement.Preferably, however, the weight of the reinforcing fibers is between 1 and 60 of the combined weight of filler and the resinous components of the mixture. The impact modified polyesters, with and without fibrous reinforcement and filler, can be rendered flame retardant with an effective amount of a conventional flame retardant agent. Examples include a brominated polystyrene, decabromobiphenyl ethane, bis tetrabro ophthalimide ethane, pentabromoethylbenzene, 1,2 bis 2,4,6 tribromophthalic anhydride, terrabromobisphenoi A di 2 hydroxyethyl ether, and the lie.In the most preferred cases, the flame re tardant agent will be a halogenated polycarbonate, and especially a halogenated bisphenol A homopolymer or co polymer These polymers can be derive, for instance. from chlorinated or brominated bisphenol A, preferred examples being tetrabromo bisphenol A polycarbonate and tetrachloro bisphenol A polycarbonate, tetrabromo or tetrachloro bisphenol A copolycarbonate, statistical mixtures of halogenated bisphenol A polyearbonates, including chloro bromo bisphenol A polycarbonates, and so forth.Processes for preparing such polymers are well documented in the prior art Generally, the flame retardant agent will be included in amounts of at least about 5 and more normally from about 10 to about 40 percent of the total weight of the composition. The compositions can also contain supplementary non resinous ingredients to improve other chemical and physical properties of the molding. The additives are selected from among those normally employed in polycarbonate and or polyester molding compositions, including melt and or untraviolet light stabilizers, drip retardants, reinforcing fibers, mineral fillers, dyes, pigments, plasticizers, mold release agents, etc. Special mention is made of compositions according to this invention which also include from about 0.01 to about 0.5 wt. of an organic phosphite, e.g., trisnonyl phenylphosphite. These are especially processable at high temperatures. The molding compositions of this invention can be prepared by a number of procedures. In one way, the modifier and any reinforcement e.g.. glass fibers . iller material, fire retardant and other components are put its an extrusion compounded with the resinous components to prolce molding pellets As a result, the mocifte ana the other components when present are dispersed iTL a matrix of the resin.In another procedure, the modifier is mixed with the resins by dry tumbling and then the mixture is either fluxed on a mill and cosminuted or extruded to form strands which are then chopped. The modifying agents can also be mixed with the resins and directly molded by injection, extrusion or transfer molding or by any other conventional method. In addition, it is desirable that the duration of the compounding step should be short to prevent degradation of the polymers and other components. The tempera ture should be controlled below the polymer degradation point and the heat of friction should be taken into account, the object being to form an intimate mixture among the structural resin component b and the modifying polymers a and c . Best results are usually obtained when the ingre dints are pre compounced, pelletized and thenmolded. Precompounding can be carried out in conventional equipment.For example, after the components have been thoroughly dried as described, a single screw extruder is fed with a dry mix ture of the ingredients, the screw employed having a long transition section to ensure proper melting. On the other hand, a twin screw extrusion machine, e.g. a 28 n. Werner Pfleiderer machine, can be fed with resin and additives at the feed port and with reinforcement through a downstream port. In either case, a generally suitable machine tempera ture is between about 450 and 6000F. depending on tne melting point of the poly alkylene terephthalate in the composi tion. The compounded composition can be extruded anc cut into molding compounds such as conventional granules, pellets and other shapes by standard techniques. The composition can be molded in any equipment which is suitable for the molding of fiber reinforced thermoplastic compositions, e.g., a Newbury type injection molding machine with conventional cylinder temperatures 450 600 F. and conventional mold temperatures 150 200 F. . the molding temperature being such that the resinous component reach their fusion point. The invention is further illustrated by the examples which follow. These examples are best embodiments of the invention, and the invention is nor to be construed in limitation thereof. Parts are by weight except where otherwise stated. EXAMPLES 1 6 The following illustrate the effect of, in one case, the combination of a rubbery ethylene propylene polymer and an aromatic polycarbonate, and in another case, the combination of a rubbery ethylene propylene dlene polymer EPDM and an aromatic polycarbonate in improving the impact strength of a poly C2 6 alkylene terephthalate resin molding. Test blends were prepared using 40 parts or poly ethylene terephthalate , 60 parts of poly bisphenol A carbonate resin LEXAN R 141, General Electric Co. and various amounts of the ethylene propylene polymer EpcarR 306 G, B.F. Goodrich Co. or ethylene propylene diene polymer Nordel R 1560, DuPont Co. as shown below. All components were t ble mixed until a uniform composition was obtained. The composition was extruded at 500 530 F. The extrudate was chopped into pellets anc in jection molded at 470 520 F. The results are shown in theTable.
