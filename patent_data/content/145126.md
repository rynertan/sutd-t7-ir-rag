# Selective extraction solvent recovery using regenerated cellulose under reverse osmosis conditions.

## Abstract
Selective extraction solvents such as NMP, phenol or furfural employed for the extraction of specialty oils, i.e. lubricating, transformer and insulating oils, to remove undesirable aromatic components therefrom, is itself reco vered from the extract stream and or raffinate streams by preferential permeation through selective membranes of regenerated cellulose. The extract stream, because of its higher solvent content, is the preferred stream for solvent recovery treatment by the reverse osmosis membrane permeation technique. Solvent recovery employing mem brane permeation exhibits the advantage of not being energy intensive as is distillation or stripping. The solvent is recovered at a high enough flux rate and at a high enough level of purity to be introduced back into the solvent extraction process optionally at some point in the process wherein the composition of the recovered solvent approxi mately matches the composition of the solvent present in the process at the point of introduction.
