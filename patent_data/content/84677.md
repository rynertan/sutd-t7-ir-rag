## Description
New compound having mucoregulating and fluidifying activity, process for its production and relative pharmaceutical compositionsThe present invention relates to 5 2 metho xy phenoxy carbonyloxy alpha , alpha ,4 trimethyl 3 cyclohexen i methanol, having formula I EMI1.1 The therapeutic properties of 2 methyl 5 1 hydro xy 1 methyl ethyl 2 cyclohexen 1 ol, or sobrerol II EMI1.2 are known since many years. It has been used for the treatment of respiratory diseases V. DallaValle boll. Chim. Farm., 109, 1970 , and more exactly as fluidifying agent with bronchosecretago gue and mucosecretolytic activity in cases of acu te and chronic bronchitis with hypersecretive and obstructive component of the respiratory routes R.Scuri et al., 11 Farmaco ed. Pr. 36, 1 1980 .On the other side, the expectorant properties of 2 methoxyphenol, or guaiacol, are well known.It has now unexpectedly found that the mixed carbonate of guaiacole and sobrerole, that is compound having formula I , exhibits bronchosecretogogue and fluidifying properties markedly higher than that both of guaiacol and of sobrerol, with a mucosecretolytic activity comparable to that of the two compounds herewith referred to.Thus, another object of the invention is provided by pharmaceutical compositions endowed with mucoregulating and fluidifying activities, containing as active principle compound I .Finally, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of 5 2 methoxy phenoxy carbo nyloxy alpha , alpha ,4 trimethyl 3 cyclohexen 1 metha nol, characterized by reacting guaiacol chlorocarbonate III with sobrerol II , according to the following scheme EMI3.1 The reaction is carried out in aprotic solvents, for example in ether such as diethylether, te trshydrofuran, dioxane, and in presence of acidity acceptors. As such, tertiary bases are preferably used, such as pyridine or triethylamine.One can operate at temperatures ranging from 5 to 100 C, preferably from 20 and 8000. The following example further illustrates, without limiting it, the process according to the invention.EXAMPLE a 124 Grams of guaiacol are dissolved in 500 ml of a 20 phosgene solution in toluene, keeping the temperature within 5 C 130 g of N,N dimethylaniline, diluted in 300 ml of benzene, are added, keeping the temperature below 1500. When the addition is over the solution is kept under stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is then washed with water and then with diluted H2S04. The separated organic phase is dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness.The crude guaiacol chlorocarbonate is distilled at the mechanical pump 150 g of pure product are then collected at the temperature of 5000 0.15 mm Hg. b To a stirred solution of 70 g of sobrerol dl trans form in 500 ml of tetrahydrofuran, 80 g of guaiacol chlorocarbonate dissolved in 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran are first added and then, in portions, 40 g of pyridine. The tempe rature raises to about 60 C, while a precipita te is formed. Stirring is continued for about two hours, the solvent is then evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue is treated with 500 g of water and ice, the oil is extracted with ether. The ether phase is washed with 2 acqueous HOl, then with water, thereafter with saturated soluzione of NaHCO3. By solvent s evaporation to dryness a semi solid product is obtained which is re crystallized from diisopropylether the solution is cooled to 0 C .In such a way 94.4 g of compound I are obtai ned, m.p. 62 C, almost insoluble in water, so luble in alcohols, acetone,diethylether,chloro form. The structure of compound I is confirmed by analytical and spectroscopical data.Elemental analysis for C18H2405 M.W. 320.38 calcd. C 67.48 H 7.55 found ffi C 67.62 H 7.59.

Pharm. Exp. Therap.96, 99 113 1949 . The results obtained are reported in the following Table I from the same it cah be pointed out how AFP 736 is endowed with a very low acute toxicity.TABLE I Acute toxicity of AFP 736EMI6.1 Species SEP Administration SEP LD50 SEP SEP mg kg tb SEP route tb SEP mouse SEP os SEP 3100 tb SEP i.p.

From the resulting values a more marked activity of AFP 736 in the test under exam clearly turns out in comparison with reference drugs used at equiponderant doses.Mucosecretolytic activityThe mucosecretolytic activity has been studied in the male rabbit according to the technique of Giraldez, Grass and Bruseghini Abstr. Comp.Int. Pharm. N. 1086 Paris 1978 , by administration by the oral route, comparing AFP 736 with carboxymethylcysteine and sobrerol at the doses hereinafter stated.

The present invention refers also to all the industrially applicable aspects connected with the use of AFP 736 as mucoregula ting and fluidifying agent. An essential aspect of the invention is therefore provided by phar maceutical compositions containing predetermi ned amounts of AFP 736. Such a compound can be administered, particularly, by the oral route, as capsules, extemporary suspension, monodose sachets in a granular state or by aerosol or as suppositories or, finally, by parenteral route vials for injection . Of course, the single pharmaceutical forms will contain the active principle together with veichles, excipients, flavouring agents etc.of conventional use in pharmaceutical technique.
