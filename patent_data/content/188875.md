# Seat belt forwarding device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a seat belt forwarding system comprising a rotary arm 4 carrying an end of a seat belt 1 at its free end. The rotary arm is driven by a tension cable 9 by way of a ro tary unit 8 comprising three transmitting members 13, 14, 15 which are coaxially arranged and supported in a freely ro tatable manner. By advantageous arrangement of the transmit ting members, even when the rotary arm is obstructed of its motion, spring means 23, 26 advantageously absorb the re sultant force and no excessive force will be produced in the ro tary unit. The first spring means 23 biases the second trans mitting member in a backward direction while the second spring means 26 is engaged between the second and the third transmitting members. The transmitting of force between the transmitting members is achieved by projections 30, 29a, 28, 27 provided in the opposing surfaces of the transmitting members, in addition to the transmission of force between the second and the third transmitting members by the second spring means 26 .
