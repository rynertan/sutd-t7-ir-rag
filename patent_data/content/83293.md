# Removal of acrylonitrile from latex with oximes.

## Abstract
Acrylonitrile is a monomer that is widely used in the synthesis of a vast variety of polymers. Undesirable quanti ties of unpolymerized residual acrylonitrile are often present in these acrylonitrile polymers. This residual or free acrylo nitrile dissolved in an acrylonitrile polymer and or its emulsi fier system and the water phase used in its polymerization can be reduced significantly in concentration by treatment with oximes. Oximes react with acrylonitrile by an oxygen cyanoethylation reaction which results in the formation of a cyanoethyl oximino ether linkage.
