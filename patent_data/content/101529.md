# A method of making a contoured cushion for a human body.

## Abstract
A method of making a cushion which conforms to the shape of the body of a particular user comprises placing a flexible bag 18 containing flowable particles of a plastics material 22 such as styrofoam in a recess provided by a mobile support 10, 12 , seating the user on the bag 18 and causing the user to move about so that the particles 22 move to shape the bag to conform with the user s body and the recess. A partial vacuum is then applied to the interior 19 of the bag 18 to cause the particles 22 to be com pressed and to coalesce. Then the vacuum is released and either the surface of the shaped bag 18 is coated with a material which will form a supporting shell 38 about the bag 18 so as to form the cushion, or the shaped bag 18 is wrapped carefully in bandages soaked in a material which hardens to form a mould shell 38 from which the particles 22 with or without the bag 18 can be removed and replaced by a polymerizable fluid to mould the cushion. The cushion then locates on the mobile support 10, 12 and provides a comfortable well fitting cushion for the particular user.
