## Description
The invention relates to a means for impro ing the uniformity of pigmentation in thickenable, low shrink polyester molding compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A major advance in commercial polyester molding technology was the introduction several years ago of chemically thickened systems. Chemical thickening is always employed in sheet molding compounds SMC , and is increasingly being used in bulk molding compounds EMC . In such systems, an alkaline material such as magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide is added to the uncured polyester along with fillers, glass fiber, and other standard materials. The alkaline material inte acts with residual acidity in the polyester to buLld viscosity. The thickened system is relatively tack free and easy to handle, and the high viscosity carries the glass fiber reinforcement to the extremities of the mold during crosslinking of the system.Thus, the use of thickened systems has made a major contribution to the commercial expansion of polyester moulding. Another technical improvement that has made a significant contribution to commercial polyester molding eechnology is the use of low profile additives to reduce shrink during the curing reaction, and to thereby improve dimensional stability and surface smoothness.tow profile additives are thermoplastic polymers such as vinyl acetate polymers, polystyrene, acrylic polymers, and polycaprolactones. There are a number of theories that seek to explain the low profile or anti shrinkage action of these polymers, but the one that seems to best explain the phenomenon is the following The low profile additive is at least partly soluble in the uncured polyester styrene solution. As the polyester styrene mixture crosslinks, the the o plastic polymer becomes incompatible or less soluble and at least partly cones out of solution. This action causes a volume expansion that compensates for the shrinkage that occurs when the polyester styrene mixture crosslinks. When a low profile additive is employed in a thickened composition, the increase of viscosity that occurs can cause the low profile additive to separate, and thereby causc a tacky surface. This problem is usually most severe with the more reactive polyesters, i.e., those having lower molecular weight to double bond ratios. To combat this, carboxylic acid function ality is incorporated in the low.profile additive. The thermoplastic polymer itself can then enter the thicken ing reaction, thereby ansuring that a tack free surface will result. However, while alleviating the tackiness probe the introduction of these carboxyls into the thermoplastic can present other difficulties if not properly understood. For the thermoplastics to function optimally as shrinkage control agents they must become incompatible with the crosslinked polyester Structure.Therefore, if the polyester resin, carboxylated thermo plastic, and thickening agent structure are not carefully controlled and balanced, the chemical thickening agent can bond the thermoplastic into the thermoses system through the carboxyl groups. This will reduce the amount of thermoplastic thermoset incompatibility, thus reducing, and in extreme cases, actually elimi nating the shrinkage control. Another property of these composites which can be notably cffected by this thickening process is internal pigmentability. Because of the thermoplastic thermoset incompatibility, low shrink, low profile SC and EMC is more difficult to uniformly pigment than conventional SXC and BMC. By careful formulation, and with the use of certain pigments, it is possible to balance adequate shrinkage control and dimensional stability with internal pigmentation in thickened polyester composites using commercially available carboxylated polycaprolactone low profile additive.However, truly zero shrink thickened polyester composites have not yet been uniformly and reproducibly pigmented in co ercial molds except when certain black pigments were used with carboxylated polycaprolactone low profile additive. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a means for improving the uniformity of pigmentation in internally pigmented, thickened polyester molding co ositions. In one aspect, the invention provides a curable composition comprising Ca an unsaturated polyester resin comprising the reaction product of an olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or anhydride and a polyol Cb an olefinically unsaturated monomer that is copolymerizable with said polyester resin c a thickening agent comprising an oxide or hydroxide of a metal of Group 1, II, or III of thePeriodic Table d a pigment e a low profile additive comprising a vinyl acetate maleic acid copolymer and f a surface active compound. The low profile additive comprising a vinyl acetate maleic acid copolymer provides the polyester molding compositions of this invention with an unusual combination of shrinkage control and uniform pigmentability. The polyesters that are employed in the invention are reaction products of r dicarboxylic acid or anhydride, with a polyhydric alcohol. The dicarboxylic acids or anhydrldes that are employed to produce the polyester, either singly or in combination, must include those that contain olefinic unsaturation, preferably wherein the oleftnte unsaturation is alpha, beta to at least one of the carboxylic acid groups. Such acids include maleic acid or anhydride, fumeric acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid or anhydride, hexachloroendomethyl ene te trahydrophthalic anhydride chlorendic anhydride . Diels Alder adducts of maleic acid or anhydride with compounds having conjugated olefinic unsaturation, such adducts being exe plified by bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 en3 2,3 dicarboxylic anhydride, methyl maleic acid, and itaconic acid. Maleic acid or anhydride and fumaric acid are the most widely used commercially. In addition to the olefinically unsaturated acid or anhydride, saturated and or aromatic dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides can also be employed in producing the polyester. Such acids include phthalic acid or anhydride, terephthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid or anhydride, adipic acid, isoptlthalic acid, and dimer acid i.e., dimerized fatty acids . A polyol is also employed to produce the polyester. Such polyols include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycols, neopentyl glycol, glycerol and l,l,l trimethylolpropane. As a rule, not more than about 20 mole per cent of the polyol will be a triol, with the remainder being one or more diols. As is known in the art, polyesters that are employed in thickened molding compositions must contain residual acidity in order to enter into the thickening reaction. The nature and production of the polyesters used in such applications are known in the art. The polyester composition of the invention also contains a monomer that contains ethylenic unsat uration, and which is copoly erizable with the polyester.Styrene is the preferred monomer in commercial practice today, although others can be used. Such others include vinyl toluene, methyl methacrylate, ohLorostyrene, and diallyl phthalatc. The said monomer is employed in the polyester composition for the purpose of dissolving the polyester which is a solid at ambient temperatures, i.e., about 20 25 C. to ensure that the polyester composition is a fluid. Enough monomer is employed so that the thickness or viscosity of the fluid is such that the fluid can be processed conveniently. Excessive amounts of the monomer are normally to be avoided, because such excess can have an adverse effect on properties. For instance, too much of the monomer may tend to cause embrittlement of the cured polyester. Within these guidelines, effective proportions of the monomer are normally found within the range of from 35 to 70, and preferably 40 to 55, weight per cent, based on weight of polyester plus monomer, plus low profile additive. A thickening agent is also employed in the invention. Such materials are knout in the art, and include the oxides and hydroxides of the metals ofGroups I, II and III of the Periodic Table. Specific illustrative examples of thickening agents include magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, zinc oxide, barium oxide, potassium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, and others known to the art. Thickening agents are nor ally employed in proportions of from 0.1 to 6 weight per cent, based upon weight of polyester resin, plus monomer, plus low profile additive. Pigments are also employed in the invention.Illustrative examples include black iron oxide, titan ium dioxide, carbon black, chrome yellow, phthalocyanine blue and green, ceramic black, chrome green, ultramarine blue, chrome cobalt alumina turquoise, cobalt aluminate blue , brown iron oxide, ceramic yellow antimony, titanium chrome oxide , titanium pigments yellow, buff , molydate orange , chrome orange, manganese violet , chrome tin pink , cadmium mercury maroon, red, orange , and the like. Pigments are employed in the invention in conventional proportions, e.g., from about 0.5 to about 10 weight percent, based upon weight of polyester resin plus monomer plus low profile additive. The invention has shown improvement in pigmentability with all pigments thus far tested. The invention employs as a low profile additive a vinyl acetate maleic acid copolymer.These copolymers are usually employed in proportions of from 6 to 20, and preferably from 9 to 16, weight per cent, based on weight of polyester plus low profile additive, plus monomer. The polyester molding composition may also contain one or more of the known types of conventional additives, which are employed for their known purposes in the usual amounts. The following are illustrative of such additives 1. Polymerization initiators such as t butyl hydroperoxide, t butyl perbenzoate, benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, and others known to the art. The polyerization initiator is employed in a catalytically effective anount, such as from 0.3 to 2 to 3 weight per cent, based on the weight of polyester plus monomer plus low profile additive 2. Fillers such as clay, hydrated alu ina, silica, calcium carbonate and others known to the art 3.Reinforcing fillers such as glass fibers or fabrics, asbestos fibers or fabrics, various organic fibers or fabrics such as those made of polypropylene, acrylonitrileZvinyl chloride copolymer, and others knows to the art and 4. Mold release agents or lubricants, such as zinc stearate, calcium stearate, and others known to the art. The polyester molding compositions of the invention can be cured under conditions similar to those used for known polyester compositSons. Typical curing 93 1650c conditions are a te perature of from about 200 C to 350 F.207 1380 N cm2 for 1 to 4 minutes at a pressure of 300 to 2000 psi. In combination with the vinyl acetate maleic acid copolymer low profile additives, the invention employs a surface active compound. A wide variety of surface active compounds can be employed. As a general rule, the ionic surface active compounds have given the best results.Classes of surfactants that deserve particular mention include Alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, and a on i sulfonates certain ethylene oxide adducts of long chain e.g., C9 C18 aliphatic alcohols certain polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers polyglycerol oleate ethoxylated sorbitan monooleate sodium 2 caprylic l ethyl beta oxipropanoic acid imidazoline ethoxylated alkylguanidine gamine complex sodium and methal N long chain aliphatic taurate sodium isethionate coconut ester certain ethoxylated long chain alkylphenols N long chain aliphatic quaternary ammonium halidc Ethoxylated N long chain aliphatic alcohol quaternary ammonium halide and Polydimethylsiloxane oil and certain other silicones. The surfactant is employed in the invention in effective amounts, usually in the range of fromO.1 to 8 weight per cent, based on weight and polyester plus low profile additive plus monomer. The Examples below discuss in more detail the nature and proportion of the surfactants that are used in the invention. In the uniformly pigmented low shrinking polyester molding compositions of the present invention the low profile additive employed is a vinyl acetate maleic acid copolymer. The maleic acid can be replaced by the equivalent fumarole acid or maleic anhydride. The maleic acid is used in the copolymer in conventional amounts, e.g., in amounts sufficient to provide 0 1 to 3 weight per cent carboxyl groups, based on weight of copolymer. The molecular weight of the copolymer, and the amounts in which it is used, are conventional for carboxylated vinyl acetate low profile additives. The copolymer is used either with or without surfactant although fts use with a surfactant is preferred in most cases.

The pigments employed were all co ercial materials marketed as dispersions in a low molecular weight polyester. The pigment weights indicated in the formula tions below are all dispersion weights and thus include the dispersing medium. Surfactants The surfactants employed are described in theExamples below. Evaluation The evaluation of the pigmentation was done visually. Non ensformlty of pigmentation can be manifested in.any of several ways, such as the presence of small spots OD the sa le, cloudiness, flow marks, waviness, lack of color depth, streaks, mottling, and other similar defects. In most cases, the various sa ples were compared with a control. The control employed was usually a polyester molding composition containing thickened, pigment, LP A low profile additive, and no surfactant. The invention provides a means for improve ment over polyester compositions containing LP A low profile additive.Even though perfectly unifor pigmentation is not always provided, in its preferred aspects, the invention provides the best combination of uniform pigmentation and shrinkage control that is presently available in thickened polyester molding compositions.

Run 2 uses slightly more than Run 1 because of the effect of the particular surfactant used. Run 4 was not similarly adjusted for presence of surfactant because the overall proportion of mag nesium oxide in Runs 3 and 4 was much higher than in Runs 1 and 2, and the effect of the surfactant was therefore not sufficient to require adjustement. 4 Runs 1 4 were first made using PPG 303 glass fibers, and were then repeated using JM 308A glass fibers. The general procedure for making bulk molding compounds that was used in this Example 1 and in ny of the other Examples was the following General Procedure for Prewaration of Bulk MoldingCompound BNC Formulations The liquid components including the pigment dispersion were weighed individually into a Hobart mixing pan placed on a Toledo balance. The t butyl perbenzoate was weighed into a vial and added to the contents of the pan and the pan was attached to a ModelC 100 Hobart mixer in a hood . The agitator was started at slow speed, then increased to medium speed to com pletely mix the liquids and pigment over a period of 3 to 5 minutes.The agitator was then stopped, and the zinc stearate internal mold release agent was added to the liquid from an ice cream carton. The Hobart mixer was restarted and the zinc stearate mixed with the liquid until it was completely wet out. The Camel Wite calcium carbonate filler was next added to the pan contents agitator off then mixed, using medium to high speed, until a consistent paste was obtained. The mixer was again stopped and the weighed amount of Modifier M was poured into the pan from a tared beaker.The Modifier M was mixed into the paste over a period of 2 3 minutes, the mixer was again stopped , and 175 grams of the paste was removed from the pan or other fillers reweighed and styrene loss made up using a largo sottula and transferred to a wide mouthed 4 ounce bottle. Ihis paste sample was stored. in the capped bottle at room te perature and the viscosity was measured periodically using a Model HBT Brookfield Viscometer on a Helipath Stand. After removal of the paste sample, the chopped glass fibers were added slowly fr an ice cream carton to the pan with the mixer running on low speed. The mixer was run for 30 seconds after all the glass was in the paste. This short time gave glass wet out without glass degradation. The pan was then removed from the mixer and separate portions of the B C mix of 650 grams each were removed using spatulas and transferred to aluminium foil lying on a balance pan balance in the hood . The mix was tightly wrapped in the aluminum foil to prevent loss of styrene via cvaporation and stored at room temperature until the viscosity of the retained paste sample reached a desired value.The mixes in this study usually reached this viscosity within 24 hours of their preparation. The general procedure for molding the samples of BC C was the following General Procedure for Molding Panels The equipment used for compression molding of panels from the glass reinforced unsaturated polyester molding mixes was a 75 ton, Queens hydraulic press 305 . 305 mm fitted with A 12 x 12 inch matched metal die mold 1 490C chromed surface . The dies were heated to 300 F., and the 650 gram portion of mix was removed from the foil and placed in the mold. The mold was quickly closed 414 N cm2 without stops to a pressure of 600 psi, and the panel 414 N cm2 at 1490C was cured for 2 minutes at 600 psi 300 F.The mold was opened, the panel was quickly removed, and allowed to cool n a hood under weights to avoid uarpage . Where any significant departures were made from the indicated general procedures for preparation of the 82SC and molded panel, they are stated in the text. 345 N cm2 Panels were molded at 500 psi from the abovedescribed formulations, and were measured for shrinkage and were visually evaluated for uniformity of pigment tation The pigmentation ratings are as follows Good 3 Fair 2 Fair Poor 1.5 Poor 1 The results are shown in Table II.

While the samples were all cast, not molded under pressure, the pigmentability evaluation correlates well with the results obtained for similar formulations in molded parts.While the thickencr oMgO in this case must be present in the samples, the mixture must be cured before the mixture has thickened or increased in viscosity. The probable reason for this is that, in the absence of pressure, there is insufficient flow in thickened mixtures to obtain homogeneous castings.
