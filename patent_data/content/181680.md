# Electrochemical cell arrangements.

## Abstract
Fuel cell arrangement in which cylindrical cells 12, 13 of the solid oxide electrolyte type are arranged in planar arrays where the cells within a plane are parallel. Planes of cells are stacked with cells of adjacent planes perpendicular to one another. Air is provided to the interior of the cells through feed tubes 26 which pass through a preheat chamber 29 . Fuel is provided to the fuel cells through a channel in the center of the cell stack the fuel then passes the exterior of the cells 12, 13 and combines with the oxygen depleted air in the preheat chamber 29 .
