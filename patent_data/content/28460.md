## Abstract
A double ended electrical plug receptacle connector assembly. The assembly 2 comprises an insulating housing 30 from an internal wall of which contact spring portions 46 and 47 of contacts 34 project obliquely into the interior of the housing 30 , in opposite directions to engage the contacts of plugs inserted into opposite ends of the housing 30 . For ease of manufacture and assembly, the contacts 34 are carried by an insulating frame 32 which is slidable into the housing which is in the form of a one piece tubular sheath 30 , to be retained therein with a snap action. The sheath 30 and the frame 32 can each readily be provided by the use of straight action mould parts.
