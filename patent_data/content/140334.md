# Accelerometer.

## Abstract
An accelerometer comprises a sheet 20 of silicon configured as an inertia plate 11 separate from a support plate 12 except at a pair of flexure sites 13, 14 spaced along an axis. Each flexure site includes a pair of flexures 31,33 32,34 mutually offset so that upon acceleration in a direction perpendicular to the inertia plate the flexures partake of compound bending. Stress responsive resistors 40 43 are positioned on said flexures so that upon com pound bending the resistors change resistance in the opposite sense.
