## Description
The invention relates to duplexers including multiple interdigital filters within a single frame, and more particularly to interdigital filters having internal notch resonators that perform a notch filtering function. Interdigital filters are well known to those skilled in the art of microwave frequency apparatus, and are described in Interdigital Band Pass Filters , by G. L. Matthaei, IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory Techniques, November, 1962, page 479 and also in the text Microwave Filter, Impedance Matching Networks and Coupling Structures , by G. Matthaei, L. Young, and E. M. T. Jones, 1980, published by Artech House, Inc. Interdigital filters include a series of spaced, parallel conductive quarter wavelength resonators in a rectangular conductive housing and arranged in an interdigitated fashion in the sense that opposite ends of adjacent resonators are electrically grounded to the housing. The center frequency of an interdigital band pass filter is determined by the lengths of its resonators. The interdigital filter bandwidth is determined by the spacing between adjacent resonators, and the width of each resonator determines its impedance. The number of resonators determines the selectivity of the interdigital filter, i.e., the steepness of the skirt of its band pass characteristic. One shortcoming of interdigital filters is that if a high degree of selectivity is required, more resonators of the prescribed width, length, and spacing must be added, increasing the length of the structure. Such an increase in length may, as a practical matter, be unacceptable if the interdigital filter is to be mounted in standard equipment racks along with other microwave modules. From PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, Vol. 6 No. 251 E 147 1129 and the JP A 57 148 403, a filtering device as described in the first part of attached claim 1 is known. This filtering device is a branching filter comprising a first group of spaced parallel resonators and a second group of spaced parallel resonators. The first group and the second group are arranged in line, and at the first outer ends of the first and second group, there is provided a coupling loop each for coupling output contact tabs with the groups. The second inner ends of the first and second group are opposing each other, and an input contact tab is coupled with the groups by an intermediate coupling loop each. Between the coupling loops at the first outer ends of the groups and the housing of the filter, there are provided additional notch resonators, each notch resonator being tuned to the resonance frequency of the filter located farthest away from that resonator. From the IEEE MTT S INTERNATIONAL MICROWAVE SYMPOSIUM, Digest of Technical Papers, Cherry Hill 1976, pages 116 118, there is further known the hypothetical structure of a common junction for a coaxial comb line triplexer. Although duplexers such as the one shown in Figure 5 of the attached drawings have been constructed using interdigital filters, wherein a transmitter 91 and a receiver 96 are coupled to a common antenna 101, it is necessary to very precisely cut the length of cables 94 and 99, which couple interdigital filters 93 and 98, respectively, to a T connector 95 that is connected to the antenna cable 100. There is an unmet need for a practical interdigital filter duplexer structure that provides maximum isolation between the transmitter and the receiver, yet occupies minimum front panel space in an equipment rack and avoids the need to provide precisely cut lengths of cable to connect the transmitter filter and receiver filter of a duplexer to the common antenna. It is another object of the invention to provide an improved interdigital filter duplexer structure with efficient internal coupling between the multiple filters thereof. It is another object of the invention to provide a duplexer that does not require cable coupling between its filters. It is another object of the invention to provide an improved interdigital filter duplexer structure that occupies minimum front panel space. These objects are met by the filtering device as described in the attached claim 1. Preferred embodiments of this filtering device are disclosed in subclaims 2 to 11. Briefly described, and in accordance with one embodiment thereof, the invention provides an interdigital filter duplexer which includes a transmitter filter and a receiver filter, each including a plurality of resonators disposed in a single frame with a narrow conductive wall therebetween and a larger transformer section that couples rf energy from the transmitter filter to a common antenna and also couples rf energy from the antenna to the receiver filter. In this described embodiment of the invention, the transmitter filter and receiver filter are interdigital filters, having quarter wavelength resonators, and the large transformer section is a three quarter wavelength line having alternate quarter wave sections of its standing waveform aligned with the resonators of the transmitter and receiver filters, respectively. The length of each of the resonators in the first and second filters is one quarter wavelength. The length of the inter filter transformer section is three forths of a wavelength. Notch resonators are provided in the transmitter and receiver filters between the transformer sections thereof and the adjacent portions of the housing to steepen the adjacent skirt portions of the band pass characteristics of the transmitter filter and the receiver and thereby increase the isolation between the transmitter and receiver. Figure 1 is a perspective partial cutaway view of an improved interdigital filter of the present invention. Figure 2 is a section view taken along section line 2 2 of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a section view of a duplexer of the present invention. Figure 4 is a diagram showing the band pass characteristic of the duplexer of Figure 3. Figure 5 is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a prior art duplexer. Figure 6 is a section view of an alternate multiple filter interdigital filter structure of the present invention. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, interdigital filter 1 includes a rectangular conductive frame 2 including bottom member 2A, top member 2C and end members 2B and 2D defining a thin, elongated rectangular cavity 12. The opposed major faces of interdigital filter 1 are covered by conductive face plates 5 and 6. Interdigital filter 1 includes, within cavity 12, a first group of resonators including 8, 15, 16, 17, and 18, and transformer sections 7 and 19. The latter elements are referred to as transformer sections because they transform cable conductor to a rectangular line conductor which then can couple electromagnetic energy to a resonator . In accordance with the present invention, each of the resonators has a T shaped configuration including a mounting base that is attached by screws to the inner surfaces of the conductive face plates 5 and 6. Each resonator also includes a relatively thin resonator section perpendicular to and centrally supported by the mounting base. For example, in Figure 1, resonator 8 includes mounting base 8B and thin vertical resonator section 8A. The transformer sections have a similar T shaped configuration. As best seen in Figure 2, transformer section 7 has its free end connected across a narrow gap 25 to a conductor 22 that extends through a conductive block 21 to the center conductor of a coaxial cable connector 3. Similarly, transformer section 19 has its free end connected across a narrow gap 26 to a conductor 24 extending through a rectangular conductive block 23 to the center conductor of a cable connector 4. The mounting base of alternate resonators 15 and 17 are attached to lower portions of the conductive faces 5 and 6 of interdigital filter 1. The remaining resonators 8, 16, and 18 have their mounting bases attached to upper portions of the conductive faces 5 and 6. Transformer sections 7 and 9 have their mounting bases attached to lower portions of conductive faces 5 and 6. The band pass characteristic of interdigital filter 1 can have a shape such as the one indicated by reference numerals 60, 60A in Figure 4. The band pass characteristic 61 will be described subsequently. The center frequency, designated by line 62 in Figure 4, of interdigital filter 1 is determined by the length 27 of the resonators 8, 15, 16, 17, and 18. The bandwidth of interdigital filter 1 is determined by the spacing 29 between resonators 8, 15, 16, 17, and 18, the smaller spacing between transformer section 7 and resonator 8, and the smaller spacing between resonator 18 and transformer section 19. The smaller spacings referred to are required because of the different impedances of the resonators and the transformer sections. The width 28 of each resonator determines the impedance of that resonator. An optimum impedance for a resonator is approximately 70 ohms. However, transformer sections 7 and 19 are wider to lower their impedance to 50 ohms in order to accomplish impedance matching to 50 ohm cables now shown that are connected to coaxial cable connectors 3 and 4. As previously mentioned, the selectivity of an interdigital filter, i.e., the extent to which it rejects out band signals, is determined by the number of resonators therein, because the more resonators there are in filter 12, the more out band energy is attenuated as the signal passes from one end of the interdigital filter to the other. In accordance with the present invention, the selectivity of interdigital filter 1 is increased by inserting two notch resonators 10 and 20 in the small regions 12A and 12B in Figure 2, adjacent to the outer sides of transformer sections 7 and 19. The lengths of resonators 10 and 20 are selected to provide a resonant frequency or frequencies that are different than the center frequency designated by line 62 in Figure 4. For example, if the resonant frequency of both of notch resonators 10 and 20 is selected to have a frequency corresponding to dotted line 65 in Figure 4, the steepness of the portion of band pass characteristic 60 designated by dotted line 60B will be increased to produce the steepened skirt portion 60C, greatly increasing the rejection of frequencies greater than the frequency indicated by reference numeral 65. Depending on how close the frequency 65 is to the frequency designated by reference numeral 62, the notch in the band pass characteristic 60 produced by notch resonators 10 and 20 may be sufficiently narrow that the right hand portion of the skirt 60 in Figure 4 might increase before continuing to fall off with further increasing frequency, although this is not shown in Figure 4. The above described structure has the advantage that, for a center frequency of about 800 megahertz, the structure could be made to fit in a standard 19 inch equipment rack, and yet much sharper selectivity could be obtained without increasing the length of the device beyond the 19 inches available. In accordance with usual practice, frame 2, face plates 5 and 6, and the resonators and the transformer sections, can be composed of copper, coated with silver to provide high surface conductivity. The T shaped structure of the resonators allows them to be cut from extruded copper sections, significantly decreasing the manufacturing costs of the interdigital filter structure of the present invention. Referring next to Figure 3, a unitary, dual cavity interdigital filter structure with internal coupling of the filter to an antenna transformer section 40 to provide a duplexer 35 is illustrated. Duplexer 35 includes a receiver filter 38 including parallel, spaced resonators 46 1 through 46 5 and transformer section 46 6 arranged essentially as described for Figures 1 and 2, and each equal in length to one fourth of the receiver frequency wavelength. Receiver transformer section 46 6 is connected across a gap 54 by a conductor 53 extending through conductive block 52 to a conductor 55. Conductor 55 is routed between resonator 46 6 and frame 36 to a receiver cable connector 56. Frame 36 includes a narrow conductive member 37 that extends between the opposite conductive faces such as 5 and 6 in Figure 1 , isolating receiver filter 38 from transmitter filter 39. Transmitter filter 39 includes spaced, parallel resonators 45 1 through 45 5 and transformer section 45 6 connected in essentially the manner previously described, and each equal in length to one quarter of the transmitter frequency wavelength. Transmitter transformer section 45 6 is electrically connected across an impedance matching gap 50 to conductor 49. Conductor 49 extends through conductive block 47 to the center connector conductor of a transmitter cable connector 48. In accordance with the present invention, a larger antenna transformer section 40 has its mounting base 40A attached to the upper portion of the face plate similar to face plates 5 and 6 in Figure 1 of duplexer 35 and extends downward past conductive wall 37 and across transmitter filter 39. Transformer section 40 is parallel to and in the same plane as resonators 45 1, etc., and 46 1, etc., and has a length approximately equal to three quarters of the transmitter or receiver frequency which is closely spaced . Three quarter wavelength transformer section 40 is connected across impedance matching gap 44 to the center conductor of antenna cable connector 42. The correct alignment of three quarter wavelength antenna transformer section 40 with the quarter wavelength resonators 45 1, etc., and 46 1, etc., is best shown by referring the voltage standing wave waveform 34 of transformer section 40, shown on the left side of Figure 3. Its rising quarter wave portion 34A is aligned with receiver filter resonators 46 1, etc., and its next rising quarter wave section 34B is aligned with transmitter filter resonators 45 1, etc. This alignment optimizes electromagnetic coupling of rf energy at the receiver frequency and transmitter frequency to the receiver filter and transmitter filter, respectively. For the purpose of explanation, it will be assumed that interdigital receiver filter 38 has the band pass characteristic designated by reference numeral 60 in Figure 4, and that the interdigital transmitter filter 39 has the band pass characteristic designated by reference numeral 61 in Figure 4. Thus, the receiver frequency is the frequency designated by dotted line 62, and the transmitter frequency is the frequency designated by dotted line 63. I have discovered that the above described structure, is very effective in coupling transmitter signals to the antenna and also in coupling received signals from the same antenna to the receiver connected to cable connector 56, while maintaining excellent isolation between the transmitter and receiver, and very low insertion loss also is achieved. By placing resonators 46 7 and 45 7 in the position shown in receiver filter 38 and transmitter filter 39, respectively, and causing them each to have a resonant frequency indicated by dotted line 65 in Figure 4, resonators 46 7 and 45 7 act as notch resonators which, in effect greatly steepen the lower portion 60C of the right hand skirt 60A of the receiver band pass characteristic 60, and also greatly steepen the lower portion 61C of the left hand skirt 61A of transmitter band pass characteristic 61, thereby increasing the isolation between the transmitter and the receiver by approximately 10 to 20 decibels. In a duplexer which I have constructed in accordance with Figure 3, the insertion loss measured through either the transmitter filter 39 or the receiver filter 38 is only approximately .5 decibels. The attenuation in the reject bands of the receiver filter 38 and the transmitter filter 39 is greater than about 50 decibels. The above duplexer which I have constructed has frequencies selected for use in the mobile communications cellular bands, designed for communication at receiver frequencies in the range from 825 to 851 megahertz and transmitter frequencies in the range from 870 to 896 megahertz. The separation of receiver frequency 62 and transmitter frequency 63 is about 19 megahertz. For this duplexer, the separation of the thin conductive panels such as 5 and 6 of Figure 1 , and hence the width of the resonator mounting bases, in Figure 1 is one and one half inches. The thicknesses of each of the resonators is approximately one fourth of an inch. The horizontal dimension of the duplexer 35 Figure 3 is seventeen and one half inches, making it easy to attach the device to a front panel suitable for mounting in a typical equipment rack. The vertical frame dimension of the duplexer in Figure 3 is twelve and one half inches. Thus, the duplexer shown in Figure 3 occupies less than two inches of vertical space in an equipment rack, has very lowe insertion loss of only about .5 decibels, and provides greater than 50 decibels of isolation between the receiver and the transmitter. Furthermore, no precisely cut cables need to be provided between the transmitter cavity and the receiver cavity, nor is any physical space required for such cables. The described duplexer 35 can be manufactured very inexpensively. The basic duplexer structure shown in Figure 3 can be extended to include more cavities, such as 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77 as shown in Figure 6. A common or inter filter transformer section 78, which is an odd multiple number of quarter wavelengths in length, is shared between all of the filters, both to the left and right thereof. Each of the filters includes a typical interdigital filter arrangement of resonators and includes an end transformer section coupled to a cable connector such as 81 or 83. The common inter filter transformer section 78 is connected at its free end to the center conductor of a coaxial cable connector 79, which can, if desired, be fed to an antenna. Various combinations of receivers and transmitters can be connected to the various cable connectors. As a practical matter, the number of cavities that can be shared with a single inter filter transformer section such as 78 is limited by frequency spread or separation of the various band pass filters. Figure 6 includes a waveform 86 that represents the standing wave voltage of transformer section 78, and shows how the standing wave sections should be aligned with those of the rows of resonators which are coupled to resonator 78. It is intended that all elements or steps which are equivalent to those of the embodiments of the invention described herein in that they accomplish substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result are equivalent to what is described herein. For example, a transformer section such as transformer section 40 in Figure 3 can be used in essentially the same manner in a dual filter comb line filer structure in which the lengths of the resonators are approximately one eighth of a wavelength, and the length of the common antenna resonator is three quarters of a wavelength.
