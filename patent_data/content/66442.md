## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESS This invention provides a process for preparing 2 E4 3 methOxy 2 pyridyl butylamino3 5 6 methyl 3 pyridyl methyl 4 pyrimidone III or its acid addition salts. This compound is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,154,834 issued May 15, 1979 and is known to be a useful pharmaceutical compound whose biological activity comprises blocking both histamine H1 and H2 receptors. The process of this invention is represented by the following reaction sequence EMI1.1 In this process, alk is lower alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms, usually methyl or ethyl. Compound III is described in Example 46 of the above identified patent to have been prepared by te following reaction EMI2.1 This prior art process presents a major environmental disadvantage in tat unpleasant methyl mercaptan is produced as a by product.Also the unit cost of chemical product is higher than that of the process of this invention due to a lower tnrcughput, higher chemical cost of starting materials and greater number of steps starting from commercially available chemicals. Another prior art process involves the use of 2 nitroamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone w th the primary amine IV sketched above as detailed inExample 24 of European Patent No. 0004793. This process avoid the use of nitroguanidine which cia explode when dry and detnated snd 2 nitroamino 4 pyrimidone derivatives. The process of chits invention comprises reactingN 4 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl butyl guanidine I , isolated or generated in situ from one of its acid addition salts, with a molar equivalent or, preferably, an excess cf a lower alkyl 2 formyl 3 o methyl 3 pyridyl propionata II or its sodium cr potassiun salt in a solvent system in which the starting naterials are substantially soluble.Such solvent systems are water, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or ethylene chloride, a lower alkanol such as propanol, iso propanol or utanol, an aromatic solvent such as benzene or toluene, an ether such as tetrahydror uran, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, an ester solvent suc as ethyl acetate or mixtures of such solvents such as water halogenated hydrocarbon. The limited solubility of the guanidine reactant in salt form in organic solvents is a factor in the choice of solvent systems.When a biphasic solvent system such as water chloroform is used a phase transfer catalyst may be useful such as a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt such as tricaprylylmethyl ammonium chloride, tetrabutylphosphonium halide or methyltrioctyl ammonium halide or a crown ether. The reaction is carried out under neutral or basic pH s such as about 9 10 maintaining the pH conditions by addition of alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, sodium or potassium carbonate and sodium or potassium lower alkoxide. The reaction is run at from ambient temperature up to reflux temperature of the reaction mixture until the condensation reaction is substantially complete. Reflux temperatures from 4 24 hours are convenient. The progress of the reaction may be monitored by thin layer chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography. The guanidine reactant may be optionally generated from its purified acid addition salt form in situ or used in the mother liquor of its formation in a one pot reaction. The pyrimidone III is produced in from 40 65 yields of good quality product. Only small amounts of the undesired isomers are formed during the cyclization reaction 5 10 . The end product is isolated and purified by methods generally known to the art. Purification is readily accomplished by chromatography over commercial silica or cellulose columns. Alternatively, it has been found that 2 E4 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl butylamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone as the base forms a crystalline trihydrate which is useful for purification of the end product by recrystallization from aqueous organic solvents which are not themselves hydrophilic. The acid addition salts of the product tit are easily prepared by reaction of the base with at least a stoichiometric quantity of the desired acid in an organic solvent such as isopropanol. The ester starting materials II are compounds known to the art. The guanidine starting material I has not been reported previously. It, together with its acid addition salts, are part of this invention since these compounds not only have a unique use as intermediates but also have histamine H2 blocking activity. The following examples illustrate the process of this invention. Temperatures are Centigrade. EXAMPLE 1 A 4 3 Methoxy 2 pyridyl butylamine 2.0 g, 0.011 m was added to 15 ml of water at 20 .
