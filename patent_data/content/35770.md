## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONAN ORALLY ADMINISTERED DRUG FORM COMPRISING A GLYCOSIDICOR RELATED ANTIBIOTIC AND AN ADJUVANTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to the oral delivery of glycosidic and related antibiotics which by this route are poorly absorbed and more especially to the enhancement of this aelivery by formulations which contain a hydroxyaromatic acid. As employed in this application, the term glycosidic and related antibiotics refers to those antibiotics which contain a carbohydrate moiety which is attached through a glycosidic bond and includes such antibiotics as the macrolides, aminoglycosides, lincomycins and anthracyclines. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART It is well known to the art that a number of antibiotics are only slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, said antibiotic must be administered by the intravenous or intramuscular route or in excessively large oral doses in order to attain clinical efficacy. The ss lactam antibiotics is one class of antibiotics which is poorly absorbed by the oral route. Similarly, the glycosidic and related antibiotics, which are chemically characterized by a chemical structure which includes a carbohydrate moiety bonded to the remainder of the molecule by a glycosidic linkage, are poorly absorbed by the oral route.The glycosidic and related antibiotics, such as the macrolide, aminoglycoside, lincomycin, anthracycline and other chemically related antibiotics, are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract because of two properties, hydrophilicity and or acid instability. The hydrophilic, polar nature of these antibiotics precludes their rapid absorption so that even the small percentage which is absorbed is subject to a long residency time in the acidic gastric environment. It is therefore clear that any factor which enhances the rate of absorption will demonstrate improved clinical efficacy. Many attempts have been made to improve the oral absorption of glycosidic and related antibiotics. Acid instability is partially overcome by coating the antibiotic with an acid stable base labile enteric coating. This procedure has achieved some success with the acid labile, macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin however, this procedure still does not allow complete absorption. Other approaches center on the reduction of the hydrophilicity of the glycosidic and related antibiotics by preparing chemical derivatives which are more lipophilic, see Murphy, Antibiotic Annual 1953 1954, page 500 Stephens, Antibiotic Annual 1958 1959, page 346 and Jones, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 15, page 631, 1972. These lipophilic esters of erythromycin show enhanced blood levels when administered to warm blooded animals. The many attempts to enhance the oral absorption of glycosidic and related antibiotics have met with limited success with the macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and oleandomycin and with the lincomycin antibiotics. In these cases specialty coatings and lipophilic chemical derivatives have demonstrated improved absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, but in most cases absorption is incomplete. When similar techniques were applied to the aminoglycoside and anthracycline antibiotics, little or no oral absorption was reported.There is no oral dosage form for either of these two important classes of antibiotics. Thus, there exists a clear and present need for a novel method to enhance the oral absorption of glycosidic and related antibiotics. Said method would permit the oral use of the aminoglycoside and anthracycline antibiotics and provide an improved oral form for the macrolide and lincomycin antibiotics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a major object of this invention is to provide a novel class of agents which enhance the oral absorption of glycosidic and related antibiotics. Another object is to provide a process utilizing said novel class of agents to enhance the oral absorption of glycosidic and related antibiotics. Another object is to provide a stable drug form utilizing said novel class of agents which when administered orally will provide increased blood levels of the therapeutic agent. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description of the invention which follows. All of the foregoing objects are readily attained by providing a method and drug form wherein the oral absorption of glycosidic and related antibiotics is enhanced, the method comprising the steps of preparing a drug form suitable for oral delivery, and a drug form comprising an effective unit dosage amount of the glycosidic or related antibiotic, a hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acid or salt, amide or ester thereof, the latter adjuvants being present in said drug form in an amount sufficient to be effective in enhancing the rate of the oral absorption of the antibiotic and a suitable pharmaceutically accepted excipient.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention, generally comprises the steps of preparing a drug form capable of being orally administered, wherein the drug form comprises an effective unit dosage amount of a glycosidic or related antibiotic and a hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acid or salt, amide or ester thereof, the hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acid or salt ester or amide thereof being present in the drug form in a sufficient quantity to be effective in enhancing the oral absorption rate and administering the drug form to warm blooded animals. The amount of glycosidic and related antibiotic varies over a wide range, but generally any therapeutically effective unit dosage amount of the selected glycosidic or related antibiotic is used. The hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acids or their salts esters or amides thereof that are used as the adjuvants in our method and in our drug forms have the following structural formulae including the various isomers possible within the formulae set forth EMI5.1 wherein R1 is a radical selected from C02H, CH2 n COOH, CH CH CO2H,EMI5.2 SO3H, H2S03H, X CH2 nC02H, S02NHR4,PO OH N OH 2, PO OH OR4, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein R2 is a radical selected from OH, H, a lower alkoxy radical having 1 10 carbon atoms, a lower alkyl radical having 1 10 carbon atoms, a lower alkenyl radical having 2 5 carbon atoms, a lower alkanoyl radical having 1 5 carbon atoms, a lower alkanoyloxy radical having 1 5 carbon atoms, a carboxy radical, a carbo lower alkoxy radical having 1 5 carbon atoms, a halo radical, a mono , di , or tri halo lower alkyl radical having 1 5 carbon atoms, an amino radical, a mono or di lower alkyl amino radical having 1 5 carbon atoms, a carbamyl radical, a lower mono or di alkyl carbamyl radical wherein the alkyl group has 1 5 carbon atoms, a thio radical, a lower alkyl thio radical wherein the aklyl group has 1 5 carbon atoms, a cyano radical, a lower alkyl sulfone radical wherein the alkyl group has 1 5 carbon atoms, a lower alkyl sulfoxide radical wherein the alkyl group has 1 5 carbon atoms, a nitro radical, N CN2 2, C CN 3, an alkynyl radical having 2 6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl radical having 3 10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkenyl radical having 3 10 carbon atoms, an aryl radical including phenyl, a hetroaryl radical including thiophenyl and imadazoalyl, or a heterocycloalkyl radical including morphilinyl and piperdinyl, wherein R3 is a straight or branched alkyl radical having 1 6 carbon atoms or a hydroxy radical, wherein R4 is H or a lower alkyl radical having 1 5 carbon atoms, wherein X is 0 or S, wherein n is an integer of 0 5, wherein y is 1 or 2, and when y is 2, both the.R2 radicals, taken together, can form a ring containing 0, N or S. More preferred adjuvants are those having the formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 is a radical selected from CO2H, CH2 COOH, CH CH CO2H,EMI7.1 SO3H, CH2SO3H, O CH2 CO2H or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein R2 is selected from OH, H, a lower alkoxy radical having 1 10 carbon atoms, a lower alkyl radical having 110 carbon atoms, a halo radical, a mono ,di ,or tri halo lower alkyl radical wherein the alkyl group has 1 5 carbon atoms, a lower alkyl thio radical wherein the alkyl radical has 1 5 carbon atoms, a cyloalkyl radical having 3 10 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkenyl radical having 3 10 carbon atoms and wherein y is an integer of 1 or 2.

Specific adjuvants useful in our method and drug forms for enhancing oral absorption of polar bioactive agents include salicyclic acid, resorcylic acid, and gentisic acid. Other hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acids, such as l hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, naphthoresorcylic acid, ferulic acid, caff eic acid, and homovanillic acid, have similar useful adjuvant activity in our process.Such adjuvants are not considered novel per se and may be prepared by techniques known to those skilled in the art. The amount of hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acids or salt ester or amide thereof used in our method and drug forms may vary over a wide range in general, the identity and the amount of the hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl acid or salt ester or amide thereof is used in connection with drug in order to be effective in enhancing the absorption rate of the drug from the gastrointestinal compartment into the bloodstream. The effectiveness of the hydroxyaryl or hdroxyarakyl acid adjuvants becomes significant at local concentration exceeding 0.01 at the absorption site. Their use at a dosage whereby their concentration at the absorption site exceeds 5 is not recommended because of the local irritating effect on the tissue. The glycosidic and related antibiotics whose enhanced oral delivery is a subject of the present invention encompass a variety of therapeutic agents such as the xanthines, triamterene and theophylline, the anti tumour agents, 5 fluoroouridinedeoxyriboside, 6 mercaptopurinedeoxyriboside, vidarabine, the narcotic analgesics, hydromorphone, cyclazine, pentazocine, bupomorphine, the compounds containing organic anions, heparin, prostaglandins and prostaglandin like compounds, cromolyn sodium, carbenoxolone, the polyhydroxylic compounds, dopamine, dobutamine, l dopa, a methyldopa, the polypeptides, angiotensin antagonists, bradykinin, insulin, ACTH, enkaphaline, endodrphin, somatostatin, secretin and the miscellaneous compounds such as tetracyclines, bromocriptine, lidocaine, cimetidine or any related compounds.The quantity of these polar bioactive agents necessary for preparing the drug form could vary over a wide range, but would normally be regulated by that quantity necessary to comprise the therapeutically effective dosage form.
