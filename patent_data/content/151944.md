# GROMMET FOR CONNECTORS

## Abstract
A connector for optical fibre or electrical cables include a grommet 26 having a body of resilient silicone rubber having at least one bore 28 extending therethrough. Two annular sealing webs 30 extend from the wall of the bore 28. Each web 30 extends both radially inwardly and axially of the bore 28 so as to be of generally conical configuration. The web 30 is shaped so that its axial thickness is greater at its free edge than where it joins the wall of the bore and so that it defines a cylindrical sealing surface 34 coaxial with the bore 28. The configuration and resilience of each web 30 are such that the free edge of the web 30 can sealingly engage a member of relatively small cross section, for example, an electrical or optical fibre cable, but the web 30 is deformable to permit the passage of a member of relatively large cross section, for example, a contact or terminating member at the end of the cable, through the bore 28. Furthermore, the resilience and configuration of each web 30 are such that the web 30 can sealingly engage a cable passing through the bore 28 even when the web 30 is inverted so that is extends axially of the bore 28 in the opposite direction relative to the body.
