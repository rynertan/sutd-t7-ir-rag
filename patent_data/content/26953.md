# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device in which a surface 1 of a semiconductor body 2 is pro vided with a first insulating layer 3, 4 having a dielectric thickness which is homogeneous throughout the surface, on a which a first conductor pattern 5 of polycrystalline silicon is provided, on which first conductor pattern a se cond insulating layer 6 is formed by oxidation of said pat tern in such manner that the dielectric thickness of the first insulating layer 3, 4 remains approximately constant, after which a second conductor pattern 7 is provided on and beside the second insulating layer 6 , characterized in that insulating paths 8 are formed between the formation of the second insulating layer 6 and the provision of the second conductor pattern 7 while avoiding an alignment step and while using successive depositing and etching steps, which insulating paths fill substantially only spaces below edges 9 of the second insulating layer 6 , during which deposition step a temporary layer is deposited to a thickness exceeding half the height of the space and dur ing which etching step the temporary layer is removed from the second insulating layer 6 .
