# Color CRT with arc suppression structure.

## Abstract
A color cathode ray tube having a phosphor pattern on the mask 25 and a window 15 in the tube wall to allow external detection of the phosphor emissions, also incorpo rates arc limiting features including a high resistance coating 57 in the neck region 19 of the tube and a getter 26 designed and placed to direct getter flash away from the neck, window and mask areas. Such a tube is useful, for example, for high resolution color displays having an automatic convergence feature.
