Representative examples of such compounds, in addition to those given above are as follows N L 1 carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L phenylalanyl L alanine,N D,L 1 carboxy ethyl L phenylalanyl L alanine,N D,L carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L phenyl alanyl glyeine,N L 1 carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L phenyl alanyl L alanine andN L carboxy 2 methyl propyl D,L phenyl alanyl L alanine,N L 1 ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl D phenylalanyl L alanine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a number of methods as described below. a One method, broadly speaking, for producing compounds in which R2 is other thanEMI14.1 comprises reducing a compound having the formula EMI14.2 in which R1, R2 and R6 may include suitable protection of any reactive groups, followed by removal of any protecting.groups, if necessary, so as to provide a dipeptide of the formula EMI14.3 and, if desired, preferably when X isEMI14.4 when R6 is OH in the resulting compound of formula I, converting R6 to an alkoxy group or tb the group NR8R9The above method may be carried out by reducing a Schiff s base as it is formed in a reaction mixture from a ketone acid or ester and an amino acid or ester according to the overall reaction. EMI15.1 In the above seductive condensation reaction X is preferablyEMI15.2 For example, the reaction between the keto acid or ester and the primar amine C can be carried out in solution using for example water or acetonitrile as solvent under substantially neutral conditions in the presence of a ,suitable reducing agent, for example sodium cyanoboro hydride. Alternatively a Schiff s base obtained by the reaction of the keto acid or ester C and the amino acid or ester D may be catalytically reduced in the presence of hydrogen at 1 4 atmospheres suitable catalysts are for example Raney nickel and palladium on carbon e.g. 10xPd on carbon. Usually the group COR6 will be a protected carboxyl group e.g. benzyloxycarbonyl or loweralkoxycarbonyl e.g. t butyl oxycarbonyl. In such instance the protecting group can be reduced giving a compound of formula I in which R 6 is hydroxy, using conventional hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis procedures, for example hydrolysis under basic conditions, for instance by reaction with sodium hydroxide in a suitable solvent.When R6 is OH it may be converted to the grout NR8R9 or to an alkoxy group by conventional procedures. For example, a compound of formula I may be reacted with SOCl2 or oxalyl chloride to convert the R6 group into an activated ester group, and thereafter reacted with an amine HNR 8R9 or alcohol to obtain the desired compounds. Compound C can be prepared by following the reaction sequence given below the compounds in which X isEMI16.1 are exemplified. EMI16.2 In the above reaction sequence the amino group of the amino acid F may be protected e.g. by any conventional amino protecting group, or e.g benzyloxycarbonyl or t butyloxy carbonyl. The amino acid F can be condensed with an amino ester derivative G for example using a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC or diphenylphosphoryl azide.An activating agent, for example i hydrodybenzothiazole, may be employed inthe condensation reaction.The amino protecting group P attached to the resulting dipeptide H is then removed by conventional treatment, for example, by treatment with an acid or by hydrogenation, for example, using hydrpgen in the presence of a metal catalyst. In the case of those compounds in which X isEMI17.1 the reduction of the compound may for example be carried out after isolation of the base of formula EMI17.2 using a reducing agent e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride under weakly acidic conditions. The resulting compound of the formulaEMI17.3 can then be treated, as required to convert R61 if it is a carboxy protecting group, by well known methods such as hydrolysis or hydrogenation to yield a terminal carboxy group, and likewise R2, if it is carboxy protected can be converted, if desired, to carboxyl.The starting compound T can be formed by the following reaction sequence EMI18.1 In the foregoing reaction sequence, an N protected hydrazine M is prepared by condensation of a protected carboxy substituted hydrazine with an appropriately substituted aldehyde, isolating the resulting compound L and then reducing it e.g. by hydrogenation, with hydrogen using a palladium on carbon catalyst, or by treating L with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride.The resulting hydrazine M is then reacted with an appro priately substituted isocyanate 0 to form the N protected amino peptide P . Isocyanate 0 can be obtained by treating an alpha amino acid ester hydrochloride N with phosgene in a hydrocarbon solvent, as illustrated in the above reaction sequence, removing the solvent and distilling the residue.The protected carboxygroup on the terminal amino group of casund can then be removed bar any standard method such as by acid hydrolysis using acetic acid or trifluoroac etic acid, to yield the free amine R see for example J. Chem. Soc.Perkin I, 246 1976 , which is then condensed with an appropriately substituted acid ketone or aldehyde S under basic conditions e.g. in the presence of sodium acetate, to yield the hydrazone T. For example, using pyruvic acid ethyl ester as ketone S yields a hydra zone T in which R1 is CH3 and R2 is COOC2H5. R6 in the above sequence may for exemple, be methoxy. The resulting compound T can then be reduced e.g. by treatment under weakly acidic conditions with sodium cyanoborohydride ,to produce compound E.Alternatively the primary amine R can be condensed with ketone or aldehyde S in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride under weakly acidic conditions e.g.in the presence of acetic acid, whereby the hydra zone T will be reduced, as it is formed, to yield the compound E directly. b The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared by coupling an amino acid ester having the formula EMI20.1 with a compound of the formula EMI20.2 in which R1, R2, R5 and R6 may include suitable protection of any reactive groups, followed by removal of any protecting groups, so as to produce a dipeptide of the formulaEMI20.3 and thereafter, if desired preferably when X isEMI20.4 and R2 is other thanEMI20.5 rhen R6 is OH, converting R6 into an alkoxy group or the group NR R 89 e.g. by the procedure described above, In the case of the preparation of compounds in which X isEMI21.1 and R2 is other thanEMI21.2 a compound B can be subjected to reductive condensation an appr6priately substituted amino acid with keto acid or ester according to the reaction scheme.EMI21.3 Preferably, however, the compound B is prepared by reductive condensation of an appropriately substituted keto acid with an amino acid ester according to the redaction.EMI21.4 These condensations may be carried out under the conditions described above in connection with the reaction between compounds D and C in method a . The resulting compound B is then coupled with an amino acid A in which R6 is e.g. alkoxy or dialkylamino or other non reactive group within the above definition of R , R6, Route b is suitable for those compounds in which R2 isEMI21.5 A starting intermediate B for such compounds is, e.g. the compoundEMI22.1 in which R10 0 is alkyl or benzyl. Compound D can be prepared for example by reaction of an amineEMI22.2 with a substituted pyruvic acid of the formulaEMI22.3 to form a Schiff s base which is reduced, preferably with sodium cyanoborohydride to form compound D . The compound A which is reacted in this particular procedure with compound D is for example an appropriately substituted methyl glycinate i.e. R6 is OMe , the conditions being e.g. as outlined above in part.a for reactions between primary amines and keto acids or esters, for instance using a con densing agent e.g. DCC. Appropriate selection of protecting groups as R6 and R10 enables the resulting compound selectively to be de protected at the group R6, by conventional procedures, to provide a terminal carboxyl group in which R6 is OH, whilst leaving the group R10 in position if desired if desired however, both R6 and OR10 can for example, be hydrolysed to hydroxy under alkaline conditions. Compound B can be cooled with an R5 substituted amino acid A using standard techniques e.g. carrying out the reaction by first forming an activated ester group by reaction of B with an activating agent such as l hydroxybenzotriazole, followed by reaction with compound A and treatment with a condensing agent such as l 3 dimethyl aminopropyl 3 ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride.c A further method for preparing compounds in whichEMI23.1 comprises reducing a compound of the formulaEMI23.2 in which. Rl, R2 R4, R5 and R6 may include suitable protection of any reactive groups, so as to produce a compound of the formulaEMI23.3 followed by removal of any protecting groups. This method is conveniently carried out by condensation of a ketone of the formulaEMI23.4 with an amino acid or ester of the formula EMI24.1 in the presence of a reducing agent e.g..sodium cyanoborohydride. If desired, the resulting compounds G having a terminal carboxy group R OH , and preferably those in which is other thanEMI24.2 can be further treated by procedures described above to form corresponding compounds of formula I in which R6 is alkoxy or NR8R9.The intermediate E in which R6 is OH can be prepared by following the reaction sequence given below EMI24.3 in which R 4 is a group which together with a methyl group by which it is attached to the peptide chain of the resulting compound E constitutes an R4 group.N Acetyl glycine H is condensed with an appropriately R4 substituted aldehyde preferably an aryl or heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl aldehyde in the presence of either acetic anhydride, or of acetic acid sodium acetate, to yield the substituted azlactone J which is in turn reacted with an R5 substituted giycinate to yield the R5 substituted Nacetyl dehydro dipeptide which in the presence of aqueous acid is converted to the corresponding R4, R5 substituted pyruvoylamino acid E .Alternatively the starting compound E may be prepared by condensing an R4 substituted pyruvic acid with an R5 substituted glycinate ester under the influence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide DCC followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the resulting ester according to the reaction sequence EMI25.1 R6 in compound. M may for example be methoxy.Hydrolysis of an ester N gives the free keto acidEMI25.2 In the case.of those compounds in which R2 isEMI26.1 method c can be practised using compounds. in which R10 is other than hydrogen i.e. benzyl or lower alkyl. The corresponding compounds in which R10 is hydrogen can readily be obtained by reducing R10 when it is benzyl, and when it is alkyl by basic hydrolysis, using conventional techniques. Intermediates which can be used to.produce compounds in accordance with the invention by this procedure have the formula EMI26.2 in which R10 is not hydrogen, and will generally be condensed with a compound of formula E in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride. The aforesaid intermedi ates can be prepared for example, by reacting together an R substituted aldehyde, ammÏnia and an R11 substituted alkoxy or benzyloxy phosphonic or acid.d Yet a further method for the preparation of compounds of the invention, comprises reacting an amino acid or ester having the formula EMI27.1 in which X, R5 and R6 are as defined above, with a compound of the formulaEMI27.2 in which R1, R2, R4, R5 and R6 niay. include suitable protec tion. of any reactive groups, and Hal. represents halogen e.g. chlorine or bromine1 R4 If desired, preferably when X is CH , when R6 is OH the R6 group may be converted to an alkoxy group or the group NR8Rg by the procedures mentioned above.The reaction of the alkylating agent T with intermediate S can be carried out under conventional alkylating conditions, preferably in the presence of a.base, e.g. a tertiary amine or an inorganic hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. The reaction is usually carried out in water or an organic solvent such as dimethyl formamide or acetonitrile.In the case of the compounds in which X isEMI27.3 ompounds in which R3 is hydrogen may be prepared by following the reaction sequence given below by way of example EMI28.1 Hydrolysis of the methylated carboxyl groups yields the compounds in which R6 is OH and R2 is COOH. The halide is preferably chlorine or bromine.e Yet a further method is available for preparing those compounds of the invention in which R2 isEMI28.2 which comprises reacting a phosphite ester or phosphonate ester with an R4, R5 disubstituted compoani as shown below EMI28.3 in which R10 is not hydrogen, and R6 is a protected carboxy group e.g. methoxy, and any other reactive groups in R1,R4, and R5 may be suitably protected, followed by removal of the protecting groups as required.The resulting compound B may be treated to remove the protecting group R6 so as to provide a terminal carboxylic group R6 OH . Also the group R10 may if desired be replaced by hydrogen. For example, treatment of compound B in which R6 is lower alkyl e.g. methyl, by hydrolysis, under basic conditions yields compounds of the invention in which R10 is hydrogen and R6 is OH.The immediately preceding method is particular ly suitable for those compounds in whichX isEMI29.1 and also those in which X isEMI29.2 and R4 is hydrogen, aryl, heteroaryl, adamantyl or indolyl directly attached to the carbon of the peptide chain.The present invention comprehends the salts of those compounds of formula I containing one or more free acid or basic groups, with inorganic or organic acids or bases. Such salts include, for example, alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium salts and salts of organic and inorganic acids, for example, HC1 and maleic acid.The salts may be formed by known methods, for example, by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with at least one equivalent of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or reaction medium e.g. ethylacetate, in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent which can be removed in vacuo or by freez rying. When the reactions described above, either for the preparation of intermediates or the final desired compounds of the invention, involve the generation of water, e.g. condensation reactions these reactions may be carried out under azeotropic distillation with a suitable high boiling solvent e.g. toluene or xylene, or in the presence of a dehydrating agent e.g. a molecular sieve.Various intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of the invention by the methods described above are commercially available e.g. from Chemical Dynamics Corporation or their preparation is also described in the peptide or general chemical literature e.g. .H. Jones ComprehensiveOrganic Chemistry, Vol. 2. p. 819 823 1979 references 2 and 29 31, and Tetrahedron Letters No. 4, 1978 p.375 378. The compounds defined above may possess centres of chirality at thetr asymmetri carbon atoms.Generally, the compounds produced by the processes described herein will be diastereomeric mixtures of compounds which are respectively D and L at least at one of the said centres of chirality.Separation of such diastereomeric mixtures may be carried out by techniques well known in the art. For example, the respective compounds can be separated by physical means such as crystallization or chromatography, or by the formation of diastereomeric salts followed by fractional crystallisation.The invention is concerned with all stereomeric forms of the dipeptide compounds set forth herein.Those compounds haing a configuration similar to that of natural L amino acids are preferred. Usually natural amino acids are assigned the S.configuration according to theCuhn Ingold Prelog system. A notable exception is the natural amino acid Cysteine which has the R configuration. Dipeptide compounds as defined herein inhibit the activity of enkephalinases. Some of these compounds have been found useful in inhibiting Enkephalinase A derived fron the striata of rats. In in vitro tests, such compounds, when used in a concentration ranae of 10 9 to 10 have reduced the activity of the aforesaid enzyme by 50x Dr more.The enkephalinase used in the aforesaid tests was obtain ed by setarations from the brains of young male cprague Dowley rats using the procedure described by C. Gorenstein etw al. in Life Sciences, vol., 25, Pages 2065 2070, pergamog Press 1979 . In this procedure the various enkephalin degrading enzyme activities in brain are resolved from one another following a procedure described by Gorenstein and Synder Life Sciences, Sciences, Viol. 25, pp 2065 2070, 1979 . The brain minus cerebellum from one young Sprague Dawley rat was first homogenised in 30 volumes of 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 The resulting hompgenate was centrifuged at 50,000xg for 15 mins and the pellet. constituting the membrane bound enzyme material, resuspended in Tris and washed and centri fuged as described above four times. The membrane pellet was solubilized by incubating it for 45 mins at 37 C. in the pressence of 15 volumes based on initial brain weight of 50mM Tris 1 TRITON X 100 buffer pH 7 4. After centrifugation at 100,000xg for 60 mins to remove non solubilized material, the Triton soluble super natant was layered on a 1.5 x 30 cm DEAE Sephacel column previously equilibrated with 50mM Tris 0.1S Triton, pH 7.4. Material was eluted form the column using a.l. litre linear NaCl gradient running from 0.0 to 0,4M. Eluant was collected in 7ml fractions, each of which was assayed for enkephalinase acitivity. Under these conditions enkephalinase A activity dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase is found to elute between 120 and 220ml, followed by aminopeptidase activity 260 to 400ml and finally enkephalinase B activity dipeptidyl aminopeptidase between 420 and 450ml.In the array enkephalinase activity was monitored by radiometry. The substrate was 3H met enkephalin 50.1 CiZmmol, NEN diluted in O.05M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, such that the final reaction mixture concentration was 40nM. Total reaction mixture volume including enzyme and substrate was 250ml. Incubation was carried out for 90min at 370C. To kill the reaction, tubes were transferred to a boiling water bath for l5min. A 4m1 aliquot of the reaction mixture was then spotted on a Baker Flex Silica Gel 1B plate 20 x 20cm along with unlabelled standards of met enkephalin, tyrosine, tyrosyl glycine, tyrosyl. glycyl clycine and the components co chormatographed in an isopropanol ethyl acetate 5 wt Yol acetic acid solvent system 2 2 1 which is capableof resolving met enkepEalin from its breakdown products.Total running time was approximateliy l7 17 hours. TLC tanks were gassed with nitrogen prior to starting the run.Following the run, the markers were visualized with ninhydrin spray. These spots along with remaining plate regions were cut from the plate and the radioactivity corresponding to each spot monitored through scintillation counting. Thus the amount of radioactivity in the spots containing respectively Tyr, TyrGly, TyrGlyGly, and undigested met enkephalin, was determined.For each plate, the radio activity of each spot produced therefrom can be expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity recovered from the plate.To eliminate the effect of natural decomposition of met enkephalin in the absence of enzymes1 the percentages of the radio activity of the Tyr, TyrGly, TyrGlyGly spots of a non enzyme blank are subtracted from the correspondina values obtained for the e erimental samDles from each of the runs using enzymes the resulting values are summed to give net product percentages for each run. In order to obtain figures for making comparative evaluations of different dipeptide species, for each species the net product percentage O formed in a run in the presence of a respective species and the net product percentage A formed in a test run in the absence of the species can be substituted into the formula A P P. The resulting values for different species are used to provide an indication of the comparative inhibiting activity of the various dipeptides. Also, in in vitro tests, such compounds, when parenterally administered in the dose range of 5 to 100 mg kg to mice, have been observed to potentiate the analgesic effects if intracerebrally administered D Ala met enkephalinamide. Pharmaceutical compositions maybe in any of the forms known in the art, for example,tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, and sterile solutions or suspension. for parenteral administration. The dosage forms are advantageouslv prepared using, in addition to the active dipeptide, a pharmaceutically accep table and compatible carrier or excipient, binders, preser vatives, stabilizers . and flavouring agents. The dosage forms will usually be prepared such as to faci imitate the administration of the active compounds in a dosage in the range Ïf from 5 to 100 mg kg, such doses being administered at intervals of 3 to 8 hours. Typical acceptable pharmaceutical carriers for use in the formulations described above are exemplified by sugars such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and.sorbitol starches such as corn starch, tapioca starch and potato starch cellulose and derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose calcium phosphates such astdi calcium phosphate and tri calcium phosphate sodium sulfate, calcium sulfate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, stearic acid alkaline earth metal stearates such as magnesium stearate and cal 2 cium stearate, stearic acid vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, olive oil and corn oil cationic and anionic surfactants ethylene glycol polymers beta cyclodextrin fatty alcohols and hydrolysed cereal solids.
