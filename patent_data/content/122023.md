## Abstract
A test for the differential detection of suspected N. go norrhoeae N.g. and N. meningitidis N.m. in provided by contacting a suspected sample with a lectin, preferably wheat germ agglutinin and either soy bean agglutinin or STA potato lectin. An agglutinin reaction is a positive indication of the presence of such microorganisms. Separate portions of the specimen may be contaced with fast substrates specific for a N.g., b N.m., and c B. catarrhalis. Suitable fast substrates are proline naphthylamide, gamma glutamyl naphthylamide, and glycyl prolyl naphthylamide, respectively, each substituted with an electron donating group at the 4 position, 6 position, or both. Another portion of the specimen may be reacted with a substrate for beta galactosidase enzyme, a positive reaction being an indication that the specimen contains N.lactimica. Autoagglutina tion, which could otherwise give a false positive in the lectin test, may be prevented by pretreatment of the specimen with DNA ase and or an anhydride such as succinic anhydride.

## Description
MICROORGANISM DETECTION METHODS AND THE SEPARATION OF AGGLUTINATED MICROORGANISMS, AND A KIT FOR USE THEREINThe present invention relates to the detection of microorganisms, specificallyNeisseria gonorrhoeae N.g. and or Neisseria meningitidis N.m. microorganisms. One known method for detecting N.g. infections is by contacting the specimen with a lectin, wheat germ agglutinin WGA , to agglutinate the organisms. In the technique disclosed in Doyle et al U.S. Patent 4,298,689, the presence of an agglutination reaction between the WGA and the specimen is stated to be a presumptive indication of the presence of N.g. microorganisms. A problem with this test has been reported in Curtis, G. D. W., et al, Br. J. Vener.Dis., 1981 57 253 5. There, it is stated that this technique may be unreliable for the identification of N.g. microorganism because the lectin agglutinates strains of other microorganisms such as Neisseria meningitidis N.m. . Another problem with this technique is that autoagglutination of the sample may take place. This requires the use of fresh isolates to increase the percentage of identification ofN.g. otherwise, there could be a misdiagnosis in some percentage of N.g.The aminopeptidase profiles of N.g. and N.m. have been studied and reported to be differential and capable of being reproducibly determined using chromogenic substrates, as set forth in Perrine, S., and Watson, R. R., Abstracts of the AnnualMeeting of the American Society for Microbiology, p. 39 1975 . Thus, there is a disclosure that the presence of a reaction product of a substrate for gammaglutamyl aminopeptidase GGA , which does not react with N.g., is a positive indication that the specimen contains N.m. but not N.g. if this test is positive, it is an indication that the specimen contains N.m. but not N.g. However, if the test is negative, it is uncertain as to whether or not N.g. is present in the specimen.Another problem with this test is that the known substrates for detecting gamma glutamyl aminopeptidase activity require a long incubation for reaction, e.g. on the order of 2 hours at 37 C, thus resulting in a relatively slow test.Hollis, D. G., et al, Appl. Microbiol., 17 71 77 1969 described a lactose utilizingNeisseria species and Corbett, P., and Ulivelli, A., J. Bacteriol., 95 52 57 1968 , described galactosidase activity of lactose positive Neisseria. A substrate used to detect beta galactosidase activity is ONPG o nitrophenyl D galactopyranoside lLeMinor, L., and Ben Hamida, F., Ann. Inst. Pasteur, 102 267 1962 1.It is also known to detect leucine aminopeptidase with leucine Wmethoxy beta naphthylamide for a histochemical cell stain. Nachlas, M. M., et al, J. Biophys.Biochem. Cytol., 7 261 1960 .It is a general object of the invention to provide a test for the differential detection of suspected N.g. and N.m. microorganisms which is both rapid and accurate.The nivtiai also e in some todiMits the Kavisicm of an additional rapid test for the detection of B. catarrhils. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a technique for reversing the mechanism of autoagglutination of microorganisms in the specimen, to reduce a false positive indication for agglutination tests.Further features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of its preferred embodiments.In general, a method has been provided for the differential detection of N.g. and N.m. microorganisms in a specimen. In a first step, a portion of the specimen is treated with lectin of a type which reacts withN acetylglucosamine or N,N diacetylchitobiose to form an agglutinated product.Separate lectin tests preferably are used, including a WGA test for N.g. and a confirmatory lectin test for pathogenic Neisseria using either soy bean agglutinin SBA , potato Solanium Tuberosom agglutinin STA potato lectin, or both . For differentiating between N.g. and N.m., separate portions of the specimen are treated with substrates specific for different enzymes in N.g. and N.m., and the reaction product is coupled with a diazo dye to form a visible color. Preferable fast substrates for N.m. and N.g. are gamma glutamyl naphthylamide and proline naphthylamide, respectively, both substituted at the 4 and or 6 positions with an electron donating group. This test can also be used in cosbination with the test for N.I.microorganism, which is detected by contacting a portion of the specimen with a substrate which reacts with beta galactosidase BG enzyme, and then detecting the presence of a reaction product formed by this enzyme, acting on the substrate, as a positive indication that the specimen contains N.1. A suitable substrate is ONPG. A further test may be performed for B. catarrhalis B.c. using a glycyl prolyl naphthylamide also substituted at the 4 and or 6 position.In accordance with the present invention, a rapid accurate test is provided for various Neisseria, namely, N.g., N.m., N.1, and B.c. In a preferred embodiment a lectin agglutination test is used in combination with confirmation by rapid enzyme tests.After growth of the microorganisms on selective culture media, for exampleThayer Martin culture media, a Gram Stain and oxidase test are performed to determine that the microorganisms are gram negative diplococci, giving a positive oxidase test. This is a presumptive indication that N.g., N.m., N.1.and or B.c. may be present. A portion of the specimen is used for testing the presence of N.g. or N.m. microorganisms by agglutination with a lectin of a suitable type. For this purpose, one or more lectins are selected of a type which react with N acetylglucosamine or N,N diacetylchitibiose. The presence of an agglutination reaction of the microorganism is a positive indication that the specimen contains either N.g. or N.m., or both.Certain strains of the above Neisseria species tend to autoagglutinate. One portion of the specimen should be viewed to determine whether or not autoagglutination occurs in the absence of the lectin. If so, in accordance with the present invention, a procedure is provided for pretreating the specimen prior to lectin agglutination, for the purpose of reversing the mechanism of autoagglutination. In one such procedure, the specimen is treated with crude or purified DNAsase, or a preparation containing DNA ase, at an effective concentration e.g. 1 mg ml . In another procedure, the specimen is treated with an agent which imparts a negative charge to the microorganisms in the specimen to cause individual microorganisms in an agglutinate to be repelled from each other.Suitable negative charge imparting agents include succinic anhydride at an appropriate concentration e.g. 0.25 mg ml . These irthdS are of general aIicability. A lectin which has been suggested in the prior art to accomplish the objective of agglutination in the presence of N.g. is WGA. However, it has been found that not all N.g. microorganisms agglutinate in the presence of WGA. To solve this problem of false negative agglutination results, it is preferable to use different lectins in different tests. In suitable auxiliary lectin tests, a portion of the specimen is mixed with a lectin which causes agglutination of pathogenicNeisseria N.m., N.g., N.1. and B.c. . Although this test is nonspecific, it serves to alert the technician that the WGA test produced a false negative. Suitable lectins for this auxiliary test are SBA or STA, alone or in combination.For maximum accuracy, it has been found to be important to combine the above lectin with one or more confirmation tests to distinguish among the various pathogenic neisseria. In accordance with the present invention, one such confirmation test is derived from the knowledge that the N.m. contains GGA enzyme activity but not proline aminopeptidase PA activity. Conversely, N.g.contains PA activity but not GGA activity. Thus, a substrate which reacts withGGA, but not with PA, may be utilized as a positive indication that the specimen contains N.m. but not N.g. Specificaily, such a substrate is added to a portion of the specimen, and the presence of a reaction product between the substrate and specimen is a positive indication that the specimen contains N.m. but not N.g. Amino acid beta naphthylamides are known classes of substrates which release beta naphthalamine chromogens as an indication of the presence of the enzyme.However, known substrates in this class such as gamma glutamyl beta naphthylamide require an incubation on the order of 2 hours at 379C for colorimetric detection Through coupling with a diazo dye. Such substrates change colors on the addition of diazo dyes. In an alternative mode for detecting the substrateenzyme reaction, fluorometric detection of the released naphthalamine may be used.It has been found that the speed of the coupling reaction of the amino acid naphthylamide substrates is vastly increased by the substitution of an electron donating group R e.g. an alkoxy group, such as methoxy, an hydroxy group, or a halogen at the 4 position, the 6 position, or both by reference to the following structure EMI5.1 Thus, an effective substrate for the gamma glutamyl aminopeptidase enzyme ofN.m. is gamma glutamyl 4 alkoxy beta naphthylamide, specifically with methoxy as the alkoxy group. Using this substrate and a suitable diazo coupler, the color changes in less than 10 minutes at an incubation temperature of 37 C for the same concentrations of reactants.An analogous enzyme substrate test to that for N.m. may be used for N.g. For this test, a substrate for the proline aminopeptidase enzyme portion of N.g. is added to a portion of the specimen. While unsubstituted proline beta naphthalamide may be used, a fast substrate comprises that class of compounds substituted at the 4 position, 6 position, or both, with an electron donating group of the foregoing type. A particularly effective substrate comprises proline 4alkoxy beta naphthylamide, specifically the 4 methoxy compound.Another analogous enzyme substrate test may be used for B.c. For this test, a substrate for the glycyl prolyl aminopeptidase enzyme portion of N.g. is added to a portion of the specimen. A fast substrate comprises glycyl prolylnaphthylamide substituted at the 4 position, the 6 position, or both, with an electron donating group of the foregoing type. A particularly effective substrate is glycyl prolyl 4 alkoxy beta naphthylamide, specifically the 4 methoxy compound.Another feature of the invention is a test in combination with the above lectin agglutination and GGA enzyme test. In this test, the presence of N.1.microorganism in the specimen is detected by contacting a portion of the specimen with a substrate which reacts with BG enzyme which is present on the N.1. . A reaction product formed between the BG enzyme on the N.1. microorganism is a positive indication that the specimen contains N.l. Suitable substrates for this purpose include ONPG, its bromo chloro indoxyl derivative and its beta naphthyl derivative. Specific substrates include o nitrophenyl Dgalactopyranoside, p nitrophenyl D galactopyranoside, phenolphthalein D galac topyranoside, 5 bromo 4 chloro indoyl D galactopyranoside, bromothym ol ph thalein D galactopyranoside, and naphthyl galactopyranoside.By way of summary, four specific differential tests for the pathogenic neisseria N.m., N.g., B.c. or N.1. are set out in the following table Substrate N.m. N.g. B.c. N.l. ONPG Proline naphthylamide Gamma glutamyl naphthylamide Gly Pro naphthylamide indicates substitution at the W or 6 position with an electron donating group.The sign indicates a positive reaction with the specified neisseria, while the sign indicates no reaction with the specified neisseria.Suitable diazo coupling dyes for converting substrate enzyme reaction products to colored form indude the following 4 amino 2,5 dimethoxy 4 nitroazo benzene diazonium salt tetrazotized o dianisidine diazotized 4 amino 2 ,5 diethoxybenzanilide zinc chloride salt diazotized product of 4 benzoylamino2,5 dimethoxyaniline zinc chloride o aminoazotoluene, diazonium salt known asFast Garnet anthraquinone l diazonium chloride 5 nitro2 aminomethoxyben zene diazotate NI, N diethyl 4 methoxymethalamide, diazonium salt 2 amino r methoxybenzamide, diazonium salt diazo 2mino5chloroanisole, or diazo 5 chloro o anisidine 5 chloro2 toluidinediazonium chloride he mi zinc chloride 5 chloro 4 benzamido 2 methylbenzene diazonium chloride, hemizinc chloride 6 benzamido 5 methoxy m toluidine diazonium chloride and other diazonium salts.An example of a suitable detection scheme in accordance with the present invention is as follows.A specimen is grown on a Thayer Martin culture plate. A Gram stain is performed on the microorganisms to ensure that a pure culture of Gram negative diplococci is obtained from the Thayer Martin plate. An oxidase test is performed to verify that the organisms are oxidase positive. A sufficient number of morphologically similar colonies are removed and emulsified in a suitable buffer such as phosphate buffered saline at a pH of 7.2 in a test tube. The final turbidity of the bacterial suspension should be approximately equivalent to a McFarland No. 3 or No. 4, barium sulfate standard. In a test tube, or an agglutination plate or tray, a drop of WGA approximately 1 mg ml in aqueous solution or buffer solution is added to one drop of the bacterial suspension. In another test tube, or agglutination plate or tray, a drop of phosphate buffered saline is added to another drop of bacterial suspension. In a third test tube or agglutination plate tray, a drop of SBA or STA approximately 1 mg ml in aqueous solution of buffer solution is added to a drop of bacterial suspension. All test tubes plates trays are shaken. The saline control should show a negative agglutination after being shaken. If the saline control is positive, this indicates that there is autoagglutination and the specimen should be treated, and the autoagglutination tests with WGA and SBA STA should be performed with treated bacterial suspensions. Suitable treatment for reversing autoagglutination provides the addition of .005 ml succinic anhydride solution to 0.2 ml of the specimen, prior to performance of the agglutination tests with WGA and SBA. A positive agglutination reaction with WGA and SBA STA indicates the presence ofN.g. or non encapsulated M.c. A negative agglutination with WGA, but positive agglutination with SBA STA indicates the possibility of N.m. or N.g. whose surface structure has been altered.One drop of the specimen is then added separately to one drop of each of the following substrate solutions namely, gamma glutamyl 4 methoxy beta naph thylamide, prolyl 4 methoxy beta naphthylamide, ONPG, and glycyl prolyl 4methoxy beta naphthylamide, each at a concentration of 1 mg ml in Tris NC 1 buffer or phosphate buffer. A positive test for ONPG, indicated by a color change from colorless to yellow within 10 minutes at 37at, indicates the presence of N.1.A positive test for GGA, indicated by a color change to red or pink in the gamma glutamyl 4 methoxy beta naphthylamide containing solution after 10 minutes of incubation at 37 C with the bacterial suspension, and after the addition of Fast Garnet GBC salt at a concentration of approximately 0.2 mg ml in aqueous solution , indicates the presence of N.m. A positive test for PA, indicated by a color change to red or pink in the prolyl 4 methoxy beta naphthylamide containing solution after 10 minutes of incubation at 37 C with the bacterial suspension, and after the addition of Fast Garnet GBC salt solution, indicates the presence of N.g. A positive test for GPA, indicated by a color change to red or pink in the glycyl prolyl 4 methoxy beta naphthylamide containing solution after 20 minutes of incubation at 37 C with the bacterial suspension, and after the addition of Fast Garnet GBC solution, indicates the presence of Bc. The above tests can be performed on a single plate including wells and simultaneously, to provide a rapid identification of N.g., N.m., and N.1. i.e., in less than 30 minutes . Furthermore, the accuracy of identification is increased by the use of SBA or STA in combination with WGA, and by the use of treatment of the specimen with DNA ase and or succinic anhydride where autoagglutination is a problem.
