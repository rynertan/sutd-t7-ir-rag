# EMI PROTECTED CABLE WITH CONTROLLED SYMMETRICAL ASYMMETRICAL MODE ATTENUATION

## Abstract
A cable with at least two insulated conductors 11, 12 wherein the symetrical mode electromagnetic field between the conductors is essentially confined in a low loss dielectric medium 13 and globally surrounded at least partially by a magnetic absorptive insulating composite 14 , attenuating the asymetrical current mode and providing a magnetic shielding effect against outside electromagnetic interfer ence. The electromagnetic field of the symetrical mode is confined between the two conductors whilst the electro magnetic field of the common mode is absorbed in the magnetic absorptive insulating composite.
