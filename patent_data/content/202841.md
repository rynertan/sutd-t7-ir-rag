# GAS SEPARATION

## Abstract
A mixture of two or more gases is contacted with a surface of a gas separation membrane and a gas having a different composition is removed from the vicinity of an opposite surface of the membrane, where the membrane is formed from a sulphonated polyarylsulphone or polyarylke tone. The membrane may be a dense film or may be an asymmetric membrane. The process is particularly suitable for the separation of hydrogen from a hydrogen nitrogen mixture when separation factors considerably in excess of 100 may be achieved together with an acceptable permeabil ity. The membrane is preferably formed from a sulphonated a polyarylethersulphone, for example one having repeat units of the formula PhÂ¹ O
