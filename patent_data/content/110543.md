# VALVE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A valve assembly 10 is provided for a paint colour change system for directing paint to spray guns 18 from either of two supply lines 12, 14 selectively while connecting the other line to exhaust 36, and simultaneously controlling the paint pressure as a function of pilot air pressure. A valve block contains two pairs of poppet valves 30, 32, 50, 52, each pair having a common inlet chamber 96 connected to one of the paint supply lines and containing a pair of poppets 132, 134 each biased towards a seat 101, 111 for controlling flow to an outlet chamber 90, 120, and a pilot air operated dia phragm 78, 122 in each outlet chamber and coupled to a re spective poppet for regulating the position of the poppet in accordance with the paint pressure in the outlet chamber and pilot air pressure. The outlet chambers are connected to an exhaust line 36 and the paint spray guns 18 respec tively, so that the two pairs of poppet valves acting in con cert under the control of two pilot air signals can control which paint line is connected to the spray gun or to the ex haust as well as regulate the pressure or volume of paint flowing to the spray guns.
