# A process for making an olefin polymerization catalyst.

## Abstract
Vanadium compound organometallic compound inorganic oxid catalyst compositions useful for the polymerization of ethy lene to polymers having a molecular weight distribution that can be controlled by selection of the appropriate member of a particular family of vanadium compounds are obtained by using as the vanadium component, at least one vanadium compound prepared by reacting one molar proportion of VOCl₃ and or VOBr₃ with about 0.5 to 1 molar proportion of a diol corresponding to the formula HO R OH, wherein R is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having a chain length of 2 to 16 carbon atoms. The molecular weight distributions of polymers formed in the pre sence of the catalyst compositions are narrowed as the cain length of R is increased. The preferred vanadium compounds are those prepared by reacting VOCl₃ with a diol wherein R is a straight or branched chain alkylene group containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms.
