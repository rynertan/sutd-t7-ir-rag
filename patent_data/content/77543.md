# Pressure regulator.

## Abstract
A pressure regulator comprises a high pressure cham ber 2 , and an atmospheric pressure chamber 3 having an opening 4 for controlled high pressure C , between which a diaphragm 5 is disposed having a sealing disc 6 resiliently movable in relation thereto, said diaphragm 5 selectively closing both an atmospheric pressure input port 8 and a through port 7 between high pressure chamber 2 and atmospheric pressure chamber 3 in the sealing disc 6 , and said sealing disc 6 being pressed towards the di aphragm 5 under the action of at least one spring 9 . In order to permit a control of the high pressure dependent on atmospheric pressure, for example of the boost pressure of a turbo charger for internal combustion engines, the pressure regulator has a bellow 11 responding to changes in the atmospheric pressure A for changing the bias of the spring 9 upon changing atmospheric pressure A . The action of the bellow 11 on the spring bias is expediently adjustable.
