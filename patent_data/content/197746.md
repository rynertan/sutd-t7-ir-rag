The unit may be a base unit as referred to in the immediately preceding paragraphs. By way of example only, embodiments of the invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings of which The invention will be described first as embodied in a domestic refrigerator but it will be understood that the invention is also applicable to commercial and industrial refrigerators. The domestic refrigerator is built up from separate units of which the first is a base unit that is shown in Fig. 1 in schematic perspective form and in more detail in Fig. 2 with certain components removed. The base unit 1 comprises a housing 2 formed or provided with compartments that accommodate the various components of the refrigeration apparatus. The housing 2 may be a plastics moulding formed to provide a recess 3 adjacent a side wall 4 that accommodates an electrically driven compressor indicated as block 5. A second recess 6 houses, centrally of the recess, an evaporator 7 in the form of a series of parallel, finned pipes. On one side of the evaporator 7 is a space 8 that is contoured at one end to form a return inlet 9. On the other side of the evaporator 6 is a second space 10 that accommodates a fan 11 and is contoured at one end to form a delivery outlet 12. The fan 12 is driven by an electric motor 13 housed in a further recess 14 at the front of the base unit 1. Across the front of the recess 14 is a condenser 15 comprising a series of parallel, finned pipes. A second fan 16, also driven by motor 13, is located within the recess 14 and at one end of the condenser 15. The rear wall 17 of the recesses 14 is separated from the condenser 15 by a channel 18 that leads, at one end thereof, into that part of the recess 14 that accommodates the motor 13 and fan 16. Also housed in recess 3 to the front thereof are electrical controls and connections associated with the refrigeration apparatus and indicated in Fig. 2 by blocks 19. It is generally desirable that the evaporator be fitted with some form of defrost device which is brought into use, preferably automatically, at times when the evaporator has frosted to a predetermined extent. The defrosting device may comprise an electric heating element incorporated into the fin structure of the evaporator. Energisation of the heating element may be controlled by an electric clock or other timing device which brings the element into operation for predetermined time intervals during, for example, a 24 hour cycle. Alternatively, a frost sensor may be employed in place of the clock or timing device. It may be desirable to de energise the compressor during periods of defrosting and this can be achieved using the timer or the frost sensor. The capacity of the compressor and its associated components in the refrigeration apparatus is so chosen that a required degree of cooling is obtained under all anticipated operating conditions. Alterna tively, bases with differing capacities may be manufactured. In order to eliminate the possibility of frost build up on the blades of the fans 11, the latter is located on the downstream side of the evaporator. Air leaving the evaporator is relatively dry , contained moisture having been removed during the passage of the air through the evaporator. It may also be desirable to provide a removable drip tray in the base unit beneath the evaporator receiving water that flows off the evaporator during defrosting. The refrigeration apparatus works in the generally well known manner. Primary refrigerant in the apparatus is compressed by compressor 5 and passes through condenser 15 where it is cooled by air flow induced over the condenser by fan 16 which circulates air as indicated by arrows 20. From the condenser, the refrigerant passes through a restrictor not shown which may be a length of capillary and into the evaporator 7 where it expands thereby extracting heat from the evaporator and its surrounds. Fan 11 circulates air through the evaporator from return inlet 9 to delivery outlet 12. As will be described below, that air constitutes a secondary coolant. The base unit shown in Fig. 2 is completed first by a front panel 21 having grilles 22 and 23 allowing entry of air into recess 14 over condenser 15 and discharge of air from fan 16. The unit is also completed by the addition of a top panel 24 that is provided at its rear with slots 25, 26 which register with return inlet 9 and delivery outlet 12 respectively when the top panel 24 is in position. The forward end 27 of the top panel 24 projects over the front panel 21 as can be seen from Fig. 1 at 28 and carries a hinge pin 29 whose purpose will be described below. The central area of the panel 24 is raised as is indicated at 30, the sides of the raised area being stepped as at 31 and having outwardly extending sections 32. The panel 24 is secured to the remainder of the base unit by screws not shown or the like so that the panel may be removed when necessary to give access to the refrigerating apparatus when required for inspection, servicing and repair. The base unit may comprise a base plate of sheet metal for example on which are mounted the compressor 5, evaporator 7, condenser 15, motor 13 and electric components 19. Supported upon the base plate is a moulding of a plastics material that forms the housing 2 referred to above. Secured to the base plate are back and side panels that provide a rigid structure for supporting the top panel 24. The base unit 1 supports one or more cabinets whose interior or interiors is or are cooled by refrigerated secondary coolant air provided by the refrigeration apparatus. Each cabinet may be of any suitable construction but a preferred construction involves the formation of the sides and back wall as a single unit in flat form, the unit then being bent into a U shape. Fig. 3 shows, in section, a side wall 33 and half of a back wall 34. The back wall is completed by a second half identical with that shown and the second half carries a second side wall identical with side wall 33. The walls comprise a foamed plastics insulation core 35 sandwiched between facings 36 of a suitable plastics material. Adjacent the junction between the side walls 33 and the back wall 34, the side walls each have a step 47 and a longitudinal portion 37 whose thickness decreases as can be seen in Fig. 3 to a hinge line 38. Adjacent to hinge line 38, the back wall 34 is contoured as at 39 to mate with portion 37 as will be described below. The rear face 40 of the back wall 34 is stepped as at 41 to receive a duct wall 42 only half of which is shown in Fig. 3. The duct wall 42 has a central longitudinal partition 43 which, when the wall 42 seats on the steps 41, contacts the face 40 of the back wall to form two, parallel, side by side ducts. The duct wall 42 is moved in the direction of arrow 44 to seat on the steps 41. As will be made clearer below, the overall top to bottom dimension of the side walls 33 is somewhat greater than that of the back wall 34. In addition, shelf supports 45 are formed on one of the faces of each of the side walls 33 that face inwardly when the side walls are turned about the hinge lines 38 to produce the U shape. Fig. 4 shows the component comprising the side and back walls 33, 34 in its U shape and seated upon the base unit 1. The smaller overall dimension of the back wall 34 allows the lower edge of the latter as seen in Fig. 4 to seat across the back of the raised area 30 of the top panel 24 while the lower edges of the side walls seat upon the ledges 46 adjacent the area 30. When the component is so seated, the two ducts formed in the back wall register with the return inlet 9 and the delivery outlet 12. In addition, the portions 37 of the side walls 33 mate with the sections 32 of the raised area 30, steps 31 engaging the mating steps 47 on the side walls. The upper ends of the ducts in the back wall 34 are shown in Fig. 4 and referenced 48 and 49, the ducts themselves being indicated by the dotted lines. After being located accurately in position on the base unit 1, the side and back wall component is secured thereto by means not shown which draw the component down tightly on to the base unit. Preferably flexible seals are interposed between the lower edges of the side walls 33 and the ledge 46 and round the inlet 9 and the outlet 12. Those seals are compressed as the component is drawn down on to the base unit. If the refrigerator is to include a single cabinet only, a roof unit is added, and, a door. The roof unit comprises an intermediate member 50, Fig. 5 and a top member 51, Fig. 6. The intermediate unit 50 is of generally rectangular form to fit on the top of the assembly shown in Fig. 4. The unit 50 has raised areas 52 on its upper and lower as seen in Fig. 5 faces and those areas correspond with raised area 30 of panel 24 in that each has steps 53 and inclined sections 54. The intermediate unit 50 also has passages 55, 56 positioned to align with the upper ends 48, 49 respectively of the ducts in the rear wall 34. The front edge 57 of the intermediate member is cut away as at 58 to give access to a part of the upper edge of a door as will be described below. The intermediate unit 50 is seated upon the upper edges of the back and side walls 33, 34 with the rear portion of the raised area 52 on the lower face of the unit locating between the ends of the portions 37 thereon and the upper edges of the side walls 33 seating upon the side ledges adjacent the raised area 52 on the lower face. The side ledges on the upper face of unit 51 are indicated at 59. The top member 51 is configured on its lower face as seen in Fig. 6 to mate closely with the upper face of the intermediate unit 51. The upper face of the member 51 is plane as can be seen from Fig. 6. The top member 51 when placed in position over the intermediate member closes the passages 55, 56 in the intermediate member 50. The roof unit is then secured in place with seals between the mating surfaces as with the base unit. Again, the securing means are such that they draw the roof unit down on to the upper edges of the back and side walls. When the roof unit has been secured in place, the assembly has the appearance shown in Fig. 7. The front of the roof unit overhangs the side walls by an extent equal to that of the front edge 27 of the top panel 24 of the base unit 1. The lower face of the overhang carries a second hinge pin 60. The cabinet is fitted with a door mounted upon the hinge pins 29 and 60 but is not shown in Fig. 7. The door is of sandwich construction with an insulating foamed plastics core between inner and outer faces of a plastics material. The inner face of the door carries a peripheral seal that seals against the edge of the raised area 30, the side walls 33 and the front edge of the raised area on the lower face of the intermediate unit to prevent leakage of air when the door is closed. A magnetic catch is fitted to hold the door shut. The space inside the cabinet is refrigerated by circulating refrigerated secondary coolant air through it from the base unit. The ducts in the back wall 34 communicate at their lower ends with the return inlet 9 and the delivery outlet and with the interior of the cabinet via two or more suitable placed apertures in the back wall as will now be described in more detail. If the cabinet is of relatively small capacity, two openings only are provided, one adjacent the roof unit and the other lower down in the back wall at a level just above that of the surface of the raised area 30. Such locations facilitate the circulation of refrigerated air through the interior of the cabinet. Shelves not shown rest on the supports 45 and are used to carry food etc. to be refrigerated. The flow of refrigerated air into the interior of the cabinet is thermostatically controlled so as to maintain the interior thereof at a temperature preset by a user. The thermostat is linked to a flap that regulates the flow of refrigerated air into the interior of the cabinet, but, preferably, controls energisation of the motor driven compressor and the motor 13. In addition, there is a door operated switch that controls energisation of the motor 13 in a manner such that when the door of the cabinet is opened, the switch is actuated to de energise the motor 13 thereby stopping the circulation of air through the condenser. In that way, escape of refrigerated secondary coolant air from the cabinet when the door of the latter is opened is minimised and in addition consumption of electrical energy is reduced. If desired, the base unit 1 may support more than one cabinet and an arrangement using two cabinets will now be described with reference to Figs. 8 and 9. The base unit 1 shown in Figs. 8 and 9 is the same as that described above with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. The construction of the lower cabinet 61 shown in Figs. 8 and 9 is also the same as that described above with reference to Figs. 3, 4 and 5 and the assembly proceeds in the same manner except that the roof unit of the lower cabinet does not include the top member 51. Instead, an upper cabinet 62 is formed and supported on the intermediate unit 63, the latter being identical with unit 50. The upper cabinet 62 is of the same construction as that of the cabinet described above with reference to Figs. 3 and 4. The upper end of the lower compartment 61 is closed by the intermediate unit 63, the ducts in the back wall of cabinet 61 being continued through the passages 64, 65 in the intermediate unit to the corresponding ducts in the back wall of the upper cabinet 62. The upper cabinet 62 is secured to the lower cabinet 61 using devices of the kind described above, seals being located between the lower edges of the side and back walls and round the passages 64, 65 and being compressed as the cabinet 62 is secured in place. The upper end of upper cabinet 62 is closed by a roof unit 64 comprising an intermediate member 65 of the same construction as unit 63 and a top unit 66 placed over the intermediate unit 65. Top unit 66 is of the same construction as top unit 51 described above with reference to Fig. 6. The top unit 66 presents a plane upper surface as shown in Fig. 9 and it also closes the passages through the intermediate unit. Hinge pins 67, 68 on the intermediate units 63 and 65 respectively provide mountings for a door for the upper cabinet. The door is of the construction described above. The ducts in the back wall of cabinet 62 are apertured in the same manner as that of the back wall 34 described above. Each cabinet has its own thermostat that regulates the flow of refrigerated secondary coolant into the cabinet. As before, each door is associated with a switch that controls energisation of motor 13 and terminates energisation thereof when the door of either cabinet is opened. For cabinets of relatively small capacity, single openings from each duct in the cabinet back wall are adequate. However, for cabinets of larger capacity, additional openings at different vertical levels are preferred and these enable the interior of the cabinet to be divided into zones whose temperatures may be separately controllable. A typical arrangement is shown in Fig. 10 which is a schematic front elevation of cabinet 67 with its door removed. The ducts in the back wall of the cabinet are shown in dotted lines and referenced 68 and 69. Ducts 68, 69 are connected respectively to delivery outlet 12 and return inlet 9 respectively in the base unit 1 not shown in Fig. 10 so that there is a flow of refrigerated secondary coolant air upwardly in duct 68 as indicated by arrow 70 and downwardly in duct 69 as indicated by arrow 71. Each duct 68 and 69 has a series of pairs of outlets 68 The interior of the cabinet can now be divided into a series of zones by means of separator shelves which rest upon the shelf supports 45 at the levels of the pairs of openings. The separator shelf is a non perforate structure that effectively prevents circulation of air between the zones. The temperature in each zone is controlled by a theremostat responsive to the air temperature in the zone and which controls the flow of refrigerated air into the zone by means of a flow controller for example a flap positioned in the respective outlet 68 The separators are, of course, additional to the conventional shelves and may themselves be used to support food etc. to be refrigerated. It will be appreciated that the outlets of each pair need not be at the same vertical height. The outlet from the duct 68 may be adjacent the top of the zone whilst the corresponding outlet from the duct 69 may be adjacent the bottom of the zone. It is preferred that the separator shelf itself carries the flow controller and thermostat and two forms of such separators will now be described. Fig. 11 shows one form schematically and the ducts with which it connects, these latter being referenced 68 and 69 as in Fig. 10. The separator shelf 72 shown has side projections 73 by means of which it rests on the supports 45. The remainder of the shelf is of greater thickness than the side projections and accommodates air flow passages 74, 75 lying along the front to back dimension of the shelf. The passages terminate, at their rear ends, in or adjacent the rear face of the shelf in fittings which align with the aper tures in the ducts. Such fittings may comprise short extensions or couplers which plug into the duct apertures. At its forward or front end which opens down wardly as seen in Fig. 11, passage 74 is fitted with a closure flap 76 pivotally mounted on the shelf in a manner enabling it to close the passage to an extent determined by the setting of a thermostat shown as block 77 and having a temperature responsive element exposed to the air temperature in the zone below the shelf 72. The temperature responsive element is not shown in Fig. 11. The temperature setting of the thermostat is controlled by a knob 78 located at the front of the shelf. It is thus possible to set the thermostat to control to a required value, the temperature in the zone below the shelf. Passage 75 also terminates at its forward or front end in a downwardly facing opening 79 at or adjacent the front of the shelf. Such a location of the opening 79 is not essential and it could be placed adjacent the back wall of the cabinet or at some intermediate position. In use, refrigerated secondary coolant air leaving duct 68 via aperture 68 The zone is maintained at the preset temperature by the inflowing coolant air which circulates through the zone and leaves it via opening 79, passage 75 and aperture 69 A second form of shelf is shown in schematic perspective view in Fig. 12. The shelf 80 is of sheet form whose lateral edges rest on the supports 45. Beneath the shelf and to one side thereof is a duct 81 that terminates at its inner or rear end in a fitting or coupler that plugs into aperture 68 The actuator 83 and other parts of the thermstat are located in a housing 85 positioned beneath the shelf 80 at the forward or front end of the duct 81. Secondary coolant air from duct 81 flows into the housing and leaves via an opening 86 in the bottom wall thereof. Located externally of the housing 85 on the front wall thereof so as to be easily accessible to a user is a control knob 87 by means of which the user can preset the temperature required in the zone beneath the shelf 80. As can be seen from Fig. 12, opening 69 In use, refrigerated air leaves duct 69 via aperture 68 It will be appreciated that with the shelf shown in Fig. 12, it is not essential to employ apertures in the ducts 68 and 69 at the same vertical level. Aperture 69 In addition, the thermally responsive element 84 could be positioned at some other location in the zone. By providing several pairs of apertures in the ducts in the back wall of the cabinet as shown in Fig. 10, a user is able to vary the capacity of the different zones. Where the refrigerator has several cabinets, each may be of the form shown in Fig. 10, i.e. with several pairs of apertures. In this case, the apertures are all fitted with closures which are automatically displaced to open the aperture when a shelf is plugged in . It will be understood that the rate of flow of air into the zone beneath the shelf may, alternatively, be regulated by means associated with the passageway 7 in the embodiment described above with reference to Fig. 1 or the aperture 2 The refrigerator construction described above is constructed from a number of common components and this reduces production costs and gives greater flexibility. Moreover, the cabinets may be supplied in flat packs containing all the parts necessary for a purchaser to build the cabinet and mount it upon a base unit. Each cabinet may be fitted with an internal light or lights switched on, as is conventional, when the cabinet door is opened. In those cases where a cabinet incorporates one or more separator shelves, for example those described above with reference to Figs. 11 and 12, the light may be a fluorescent tube housed vertically in the back wall of the cabinet to illuminate all the zones in the cabinet. Suitable electrical plug and socket joints between base and cabinets interconnect such light or lights automati cally with the electrical supply at 19 when the base unit and cabinets are stacked one on the other. It will be understood that, if desired, the vertical ducts of a cabinet may have a horizontal branch or branches permitting further cabinets to be located alongside the one cabinet instead of or additional to the top mounting positions described above. It is not essential that the refrigerated cabinets be mounted directly on the base unit. The cabinets may be located some distance from the base unit, cooled air being supplied from and returned to the latter by ducts which may include flexible portions. The cabinets may be in the form of drawers of a kitchen unit for instance. Fig. 13 shows in schematic perspective an embodiment of the invention in which a base 88 is housed in a kitchen unit 89 and whose ducts 90, 91 are connected by a length 92 of ducting to a wall mounted cupboard 93 whose interior is to be cooled. The length 92 of ducting is also joined and a further length 94 of ducting in the nature of a cool air ring main having a branch 95 that supplied cool air to a refrigerated drawer 96 and a further branch 97 terminating in an inlet and outlet 98 to which may be connected an appliance requiring a supply of cool air for example ice cream making equipment. The main 94 is also joined to a branch 99 terminating in cooling coils beneath a draining board 100. It will be understood that the lengths of ducting and the branches are protected by appropriate thermal insulation not shown . Other materials than those specified above may be used to construct various component parts of the refrigerator. Particularly suitable is a high strength inorganic material based on hydraulic cement with a small amount of organic rheological aid. The material and its production is described in more detail in European Patent Applications Nos. 80.301909.0 0 021 682 and 81.301228.3 0 038 126 .
