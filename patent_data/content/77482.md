# Noise, flash and smoke suppressor apparatus and method for rocket launcher.

## Abstract
A shock suppressing device adapted to be attached to the aft end of a shoulder fired rocket launcher. The device comprises an elongated, flexible, tubular member formed of a compressible, permeable fabric. The member has an expanded diameter substantially greater than the diameter of the exhaust opening in the aft end of the rocket launcher tube. In one embodiment, the rear of the member is covered with fabric so that the member forms a bag covering the exhaust opening of the rocket launcher. The member has a sufficient expanded volume to contain the exhaust gases generated by a launched rocket thereby confirning these exhaust gasses and their associated flash, smoke and blast wave. The blast wave is dissipating by forcing it to penetrate the member. In another embodiment, the rear of the member is open thus causing the generated shock wave to be accelerated rearwardly while being dissipated. The full expansion of the shock wave is not allowed until the shock wave has been reduced significantly.
