# PROPELLANT AUGMENTED, PRESSURIZED GAS DISPENSING DEVICE

## Abstract
A propellant augmented, gas dispensing device of the type that includes a propellant chamber coupled to a pressure vessel containing a pressurized gas and exhaust passage from the propellant chamber incorporates an addi tional depressurization vessel coupled in fluid communica tion with the exhaust passage from the propellant chamber. The depressurization vessel has a restricted exhaust pas sage. The exhaust passage from the propellant chamber is constructed to allow a relating high flow rate from the propellant chamber into the depressurization chamber, permitting rapid depressurization of the propellant chamber to assure propellant extinguishment. At the same time, the restricted exhaust passage from the depressurization vessel permits controlled metering of the outflow of pressurized gas from the dispensing device.
