# Preparation of 6 alpha bromo and or 6,6 dibromo penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxides.

## Abstract
Preparation of 6 alpha bromo and or 6,6 dibromo penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxides by diazotising a 6 bÃªta amino penicillanic acid, 1,1 dioxide and subsequently brominating the diazotised compounds. The bromo compounds prepared according to the invention are valuable intermediates be cause they can be debrominated to yield penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide and derivatives thereof. The preparation of 6 diazo penicillanic aicd 1,1 dioxide and derivatives thereof is also disclosed as well as these new compounds as such.
