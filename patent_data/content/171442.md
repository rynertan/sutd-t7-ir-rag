# Silicone release coating and inhibitors.

## Abstract
A solventless release coating composition is provided as well as a method for rendering materials nonadherent to other materials which would normally adhere thereto. The coating composition is a precious metal catalyzed silicone composition comprising a vinyl functional polysiloxane base polymer and a methylhydrogen cross linking agent. A blend of diallylmaleate and vinyl acetate is added to the composi tion in order to extend the useful pot life of the product by inhibiting premature cross linking.
