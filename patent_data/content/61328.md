# Gas separating and venting filter.

## Abstract
A gas separating and venting filter is disclosed for separating gases and liquids and venting the gases in any position of the filter. A housing defines an interior chamber, with inlet 20 and outlet 26 means for the flow of liquid into and out of the chamber. A hydrophilic filter membrane 46 extends along one major wall of the chamber, with longitudi nally extending open sided passageways in the one major wall facing the hydrophilic filter membrane and leading to the outlet means. The hydrophilic filter membrane is flexible for ballooning into the passageways in response to a build up of pressure in the chamber to restrict and or cut off the flow of liquid through the passageways. A hydrophobic filter membrane 44 extends along substantially the entire length of an opposite major wall of the chamber between the inlet and outlet means for passing gas but not liquid therethrough. A plurality of spaced vent holes 42 are formed in the opposite major wall for venting gas which has passed through the hydrophobic filter membrane.
