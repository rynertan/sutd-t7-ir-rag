## Description
The present invention relates to a method for the production of HA fraction containing protective antigens of Pertussis is one of the infectious diseases and appears frequently in babies and children and hence is very important disease in view of public health. Particularly, babies suffered from this disease occasionally show very heavy symptom and sometimes result in death. It is well known that this disease can be protected by a previous vaccination, and for such a purpose, there is widely used an inactivated vaccine prepared from whole cells of Sato et al had succeeded in the production of precipitated purified pertussis vaccine which is an epochal acellular vaccine and had been found based on basic study on protective antigens cf. Japanese Patent Publication No. 5203 1982 . This vaccine comprises mainly as the protective antigens HA fraction containing F HA and LPF HA and shows excellent protective effect with a little side reaction, and hence, it has already practically been used. This precipitated pertussis vaccine is prepared by inoculating This method has, however, a problem in the culture of microorganism in a large scale, and hence, the vaccine is hardly produced in an industrial scale. That is, according to the known method for the preparation of precipitated purified pertussis vaccine, the culture is carried out in a small vessel such as Roux s bottle containing 100 to 300 ml of a liquid medium at about 35 C for 5 days under static condition, which method is very small scale and requires very long incubation period of time. Generally, culture of microorganisms in a large scale is carried out by a spinner culture in a liquid medium using a fermenter. It is reported that Recently, Suzuki et al had studied on various additives which can promote the growth of However, when the above method is applied to scaled up fermentation using a fermentation tank e.g. a 10 liter or larger volume tank in order to produce the pertussis vaccine in an industrial scale, it has been found that cell concentration can be increased in rotary shaking culture or reciprocal shaking culture under a constant shaking condition, but the production of LPF HA is not sufficient, which is unexpected from the common sense in the conventional shaking culture. In Manual for the production and control of vaccine, Pertussis vaccine, WHO in 1977, there is disclosed a large scale culture of The present inventors have extensively studied on an improved method for the production of HA fraction containing protective antigens of An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for producing HA fraction containing protective antigens of According to the present invention, the desired HA fraction can be produced by inoculating The starting The liquid medium includes any known liquid media, preferably Stainer Scholte medium, more preferably an modified Stainer Scholte medium, i.e. Stainer Scholte medium supplemented with 0.1 to 20 g l of casamino acids wherein the contents of ascorbic acid and glutathione are controlled to the range of 0.01 to 1 g l and 0.1 to 5 g l, respectively hereinafter, referred to as modified medium . The cyclodextrin abbreviated as CD or its derivative to be added to the medium includes all isomers of α CD, β CD and γ CD etherified derivatives such as methylated α CD, methylated β CD, or methylated γ CD and further aminated derivatives and esterified derivatives, or the like. These CD compounds are used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Among these compounds, dimethylated β CD heptakis 2,6 O dimethyl β cyclodextrin , dimethylated α CD heptakis 2,6 O dimethyl α cyclodextrin, trimethylated β CD heptakis 2,3,6 O trimethyl β cyclodextrin and trimethylated α CD heptakis 2,3,4 O trimethyl α cyclodextrin are most effective. The amount of the CD compounds is not critical, but is usually in the range of 0.001 to 5 g l, preferably about 0.5 to 2.5 g l. It has been found by the present inventors that the cell growth of Optimum range of the culturing temperature was examined by using, as a seed culture, a subculture of The results are shown in the accompanying Fig. 1. As is shown in Fig. 1, the microorganism can grow well at a culture temperature of from 20 to 37 C, preferably from 23 to 37 C. The amount of DO in the medium is in the range of from 0.7 to 6.0 ppm, preferably from 1.0 to 5.5 ppm. By controlling the DO to the above range, propagation of The DO is preferably regulated by controlling the aeration rate and stirring rate. The aeration rate and stirring rate are not specified, but the aeration rate is not more than 3 VVM, usually in the range of from 0.1 to 2 VVM, preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 VVM, and the stirring rate is not more than 600 r.p.m., usually in the range of from 50 to 350 r.p.m., preferably from 100 to 250 r.p.m. When pure oxygen is used together with air, the aeration rate and stirring rate may be decreased. The growth of the microorganism in the culture broth and the yield of F HA and LPF HA are also significantly affected by defoaming treatment. For instance, when the culture is carried out without defoaming under the same conditions as in Example 1 as disclosed hereinafter, the cells adhere to foams and are deposited on the wall of vessel or are exhausted through an air exhaust nozzle, which results in several to 80 decrease of the cell concentration and of the amount of F HA and LPF HA. The defoaming may be done by a conventional mechanical defoaming or chemical defoaming, for instance, with a conventional defoaming device such as rotary disc or spray nozzle, or with a chemical defoaming agent such as aliphatic esters e.g. B 3009A, manufactured by Asahi Electrochemical Co. LTD. , silicon compounds e.g. KM70, KM72, manufactured by Shinetsu Chemical Co. LTD. , alcohol compounds e.g. LG109, LG126, manufactured by Asahi Electrochemical Co. LTD. . Mechanical defoaming is more preferable in view of easier recovery and purification of the HA fraction from the culture broth. Optimum pH range of the medium was determined by culturing The control of the culture temperature, amount of DO, defoaming, and pH range is carried out by automatical control or manual control. In order to obtain the desired HA fraction in a high yield, it is important to check the growth phase of microorganism, and it is most preferable to harvest the fraction at the stage of from logarithmic growth phase to stationary growth phase via conversion phase. This stage may vary with amounts of the microorganism to be inoculated, but is usually 7 to 40 hours after inoculation. For instance, when 1.0 IOU ml of the microorganism is inoculated, the suitable culture time is usually 24 to 35 hours. Using the HA fraction containing culture broth, a precipitated purified pertussis vaccine is prepared, for instance, in the following manner. The culture broth obtained above is used as it stands or it is used after being centrifuged to separate the supernatant fluid. To the culture broth or supernatant fluid is added ammonium sulfate so as to become about 1 3 saturation, and the resulting precipitates are collected by centrifugation or filtration. The precipitates are dissolved in a phosphate buffer pH 7.2 containing 1 mole of sodium chloride. To the solution is added ammonium sulfate so as to become about 1 2 saturation, and the resulting precipitates are separated by centrifugation or filtration. The precipitates are dialyzed against the same buffer as above in a dialyzer tubing. The resulting solution is ultra centrifuged, and the supernatant fluid is subjected to a sucrose density gradient centrifuge, and the supernatant fluid HA fractions of The HA fraction thus obtained is appropriately diluted with a saline, usually in 2 to 3 fold dilution, and thereto is added formalin in a concentration of 0.1 to 1.2 v v , preferably 0.4 to 0.8 v v , and the mixture is treated at a temperature of 20 to 43 C preferably 37 to 40 C, for 3 to 60 days. By this formalin treatment, LPF activity and HSF Histamine sensitizing factor activity are decreased to give an atoxic fraction. It has been found by the present inventors that when the formalin treatment is carried out in the presence of an amino acid, the period of time for the formalin treatment is remakedly shortened and further neither aggregated precipitation nor reversal of toxicity are observed. A stabilizer such as Tween 80 or gelatin may optionally be added together with the amino acid. The stabilizer is usually used in an amount of 0.02 to 0.05 . The amino acid includes glycine, methionine, cysteine, sodium glutamate, aspartic acid, serine, alanine, leucine, valine, threonine, γ aminobutyric acid, lysine, histidine, etc. which may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. The amount of the amino acid is not critical, but is usually in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 M, preferably 0.05 to 0.3 M. When the purified HA fraction obtained from the culture broth in the present invention, i.e. after being cultured in a medium containing cyclodextrin or its derivative using a fermenter, is formalinized in the presence of an amino acid, no aggregated precipitates are produced, and hence, it can be filtered with a conventional membrane filter for sterilization. On the contrary, when the formalinization is carried out substantially in absence of an amino acid, aggregated precipitates are produced like in the formalinization of the HA fraction obtained by a conventional stationary culture in a medium containing no cyclodextrin, and hence, it is required to crush with ultrasonic treatment. In this case, it is difficult to pass the fraction through a membrane filter for sterilization. After the formalinization and filtration as above, the filtrate is regulated so as to have an appropriate concentration of protein, usually a final concentration of protein nitrogen 8 to 2o µg TCAPN ml TCAPN hot trichloroacetic acid precipitable protein nitrogen . The solution thus obtained is optionally mixed with diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid, and is precipitated optionally by adding thereto an adjuvant such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate in a final concentration of 0.15 to 0.3 µg ml, and then the resulting precipitates are removed. Finally, a stabilizer such as gelatin or glucose and also a preservative such as thimerosal are added thereto to give the desired vaccine. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples, but should not be construed to be limited thereto. A 50 liter fermenter manufactured by Marubishi Rika K.K. was charged with a modified medium 35 liters having the components as shown in Table 1 wherein sterilized methylated β CD being added in a final concentration of 1.0 g liter. After inoculating As to the culture broth thus obtained, the following various factors were measured. Cell concentration measured in the same manner as described hereinbefore, As is clear from Figure 2, increased growth of microorganism and enhanced production of HA fraction were observed in the range of DO 0.7 to 6.0 ppm, particularly 1.0 to 5.5 ppm. Production of HA fraction of A 14 liter fermenter manufactured by NBS Co. was charged with the same modified medium 10 liters as used in Example 1 wherein methylated β CD was added in a final concentration of 1.0 g liter and thereto was inoculated In Reference Examples 1 5, 7 and 8 in Table 2, the culture was carried out at a constant aeration and stirring without defoaming treatment, among which the culturing conditions in Reference Example 5 stirring rate 100 r.p.m., aeration 0.5 VVM gave good production of HA fraction. However, even under such good conditions, although a certain logarithmic growth cell concentration about 10 IOU ml was achieved till about 10 hours, the rate of growth was rapidly decreased thereafter and, even after 36 hours, the cell concentration was still about 15 IOU ml and the production of HA fractions was also so low F HA 16 HA ml, LPF HA 100 LPEu ml . Even when the culture was continued for 48 hours, neither cell concentration nor production of HA fraction was almost increased. In Reference Examples 7 and 8, the culture was carried out at a constant stirring of 500 r.p.m. or 600 r.p.m. with aeration rate of 0.2 VVM without defoaming treatment. In bothe cases, after 5 to 10 hours, cells adhered onto the upper wall of vessel or the culture both flowed out from the vessel due to vigorous foaming, and even though all cells remained within the vessel, adhered on the wall and also flowed out one were collected after 36 hours, the production of HA fraction was significantly low. In Reference Example 10, the culture was carried out under controlling DO but without defoaming treatment. In this culture, there were similarly observed the flowing out of culture broth and adhesion of cells onto the wall, and the production of HA fraction was extremely low. In Reference Examples 6 to 9, the culture was carried out at a constant aeration and stirring with defoaming treatment. In all cases, the DO amount at the initial stage of culture was more than 6.0 ppm which is not suitable for production of HA fraction. With progressing the culture, the DO decreased sequentially, and before 36 hours, it became lower than 0.7 ppm which is not suitable for propagation of cells and also for the production of HA fraction. In Reference Example 9, wherein a chemical defoaming being carried out, after 36 hours, the cell concentration became 80 IOU ml, but F HA and LPF HA were 128 HA ml and 500 LPEu ml, respectively. In Examples 2 to 5, the culture was carried out under controlling the DO within a range of 1.6 to 3.5 ppm by controlling automatically and continuously the aeration and stirring rate with a DO controller manufactured by NBS Co. with defoaming treatment. In all Examples, even after 10 hours, the microorganism grew in logarithmic phase and after 36 hours, high levels of cell concentration, F HA and LPF HA were obtained. By the way, when aeration was done from surface, no production of HA fraction was observed. As is clear from the above results, in a fermenter without DO control, growth of cells was observed when defoamation was done, but even in such case, the productivity of F HA and LPF HA was still very low. On the other hand, when the culture was carried out under DO control, not only growth of cells but also production of F HA and LPF HA were significantly increased. Thus, in a fermenter, by DO control, growth of cells is increased and further the production of the desired HA fraction of The culture of the present invention wherein it was carried out under specific conditions in order to produce the desired HA fraction of Culture vessel 1.5 liter volume Roux s bottle Culture vessel 300 liter fermenter manufactured by Marubishi Rika K.K. As is clear from Table 3, the method of the present invention is far greater than the conventional static culture in the propagation of cells and the LPF HA production and is the same or higher in the F HA production. For instance, the method of the present invention is 2 to 3 times higher than the static culture in the cell concentration, and 10 times or higher in the LPF HA level. Besides, the incubation period of time was significantly shortened, i.e. from 120 hours to 35 hours, in the present invention. The change of time course of cell concentration, F HA and LPF HA levels in the culture under DO control in Examples 6 and 7 are shown in the accompanying Figures 3 I and II and Figures 4 I and II , respectively. As is clear from these Figures, the culture under DO control in the present invention can give increased cell concentration and also significantly increased F HA and LPF HA production. The HA fraction obtained in Example I was diluted with physiological saline so as to become a protein concentration of 30 µg TCAPN ml. To the solution was added formalin in a concentration of 0.6 or 1.0 v v and the mixture was treated at 37 C or 39 C for 5 to 21 days. In this formalinizing step, various amino acids as shown in Table 4 were added in a concentration as shown therein. During the formalin treatment, aggregated precipitate was markedly appeared, and then the solution was dialyzed with a dialyzer tubing in order to remove formalin and then residual toxicity of the product was tested in mice. Besides, after being kept at 37 C for 3 weeks, reversal of toxicity was also tested. The potency of the vaccines was also tested. These results are shown in Table 4. The cultures obtained above were pooled and inoculated into the same medium as above 200 liter in a 300 liter fermenter manufactured by Marubishi Rika K.K. in an amount of 1.0 IOU ml, and it was cultured with aeration and agitation. The culture was carried out under controlling automatically the aeration and agitation rate so as to make the DO within the range of 1.8 to 2.7 ppm. Besides, other conditions were automatically controlled so as to be the culture temperature 35 C and pH 7.2, and further, the defoamation was mechanically done with a rotary disc. After culturing for 35 hours, the culture broth was collected. As to the culture broth, the cell concentration and amount of HA fraction were measured. As a result, it showed a cell concentration 210 IOU ml, F HA 1,024 HA ml, and LPF HA 2,400 LPEu ml. The culture broth was centrifuged, and the supernatant fluid was collected. To the supernatant fluid was added ammonium sulfate so as to become 1 3 saturation, and the resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 20 000 x g for 30 minutes. The precipitates were dissolved in a phosphate buffer pH 7.2 supplemented with 1 mole of sodium chloride and the undissolved materials were removed by centrifugation at 20 000 x g for 30 minutes. To the resulting supernatant fluid was added ammonium sulfate so as to become about 1 2 saturation. The resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation likewise and were again dissolved in the same buffer as above and dialyzed at 4 C in a dialyzer tubing, and the undissolved materials were removed by centrifugation likewise. The solution was super centrifuged and the supernatant fluid was subjected to 10 to 30 sucrose density gradient centrifuge at 105 000 x g for 20 hours , and then, HA fractions were collected. The HA fractions were pooled and sterilized by filtering through a membrane filter. The protein concentration of the HA fraction was diluted with the same buffer as above in 30 µg TCAPN ml. The above steps of the treatment of the collected culture broth and the purification of the HA fraction were carried out at 2 to 4 C. To the HA fraction obtained above were added 0.6 v v of formalin, 0.05 v v of Tween 80, 0.02 w v of gelatin and 0.25 M of glycine, and the mixture was kept at 39 C for 7 days. The mixture was dialyzed against a phosphate buffer pH 7.2 supplemented with 0.7 w v of sodium chloride in a dialyzer tubing to remove formalin, and the resulting solution was diluted with the same buffer as above so as to make a protein concentration in 8 µg TCAPN ml to give a diluted solution of an atoxic HA fraction. To the diluted solution was added an aluminum hydroxide gel in an amount of 0.20 mg ml converted to aluminum , by which the HA fraction was adsorbed onto the aluminum gel, to which was added 0.01 w v of thimerosal as a preservative to give the desired precipitated purified pertussis vaccine. The properties of the vaccine thus obtained were tested in accordance with the national control tests cf. Minimum Requirement of Biological Products, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan, 287, 1981 . As a result, all properties thereof were satisfactory as shown in Table 5. To the diluted solution of atoxic HA fraction obtained in Example 9 were added diphtheria toxoid 33 Lf ml and tetanus toxoid 5 Lf ml , and thereto was added an aluminum hydroxide gel 0.20 mg ml, converted to aluminum , by which the HA fraction and toxoids were adsorbed onto the aluminum gel. To the mixture were added 0.02 w v of gelatin and 0.1 w v of glucose as a stabilizer and further 0.01 w v of thimerosal as a preservative to give the desired mixed vaccine of a precipitated purified pertussis vaccine, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid. The properties of the combined vaccine thus obtained were tested in accordance with the national control tests cf. Minimum Requirement of Biological Products, Ministry of Health and Wellfare, Japan, 287, 1981 . As a result, all properties thereof were satisfactory as shown in Table 6.
