# Method of laying pipe underground and system therefor.

## Abstract
A method of and a system for laying a pipe underground wherein a head 5 attached to the leading end of the pipe 4 to be laid underground is caused to move in vibratory movement while a propelling force is exerted on the rear end of the pipe 4 to obtain penetration of the earth by the pipe 4 . While the head 5 is forced to move ahead by the propelling force exerted on the rear end of the pipe 4 , the vibration of the head 5 is measured. When the vibration drops in magnitude, the propelling force is decreased to reduce the speed at which the head 5 is forced to move ahead so as to cause restoration of the vibration to the original level, and when the vibration rises, the propelling force is increased to increase the speed at which the head is forced to move ahead.
