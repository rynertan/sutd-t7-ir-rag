# Erasable, reusable optical recording elements and methods for erasing such elements.

## Abstract
An erasable, reusable opticalreacording element com prises a support having thereon an optical recording layer comprising an amorphous layer of a dye and a binder. The recording layer has a transparent ceramic overcoat with a thickness between 0.05µm and 0.3µm. Recorded tracks can be erased selectively by applying laser light, preferably on the edges of the track.
