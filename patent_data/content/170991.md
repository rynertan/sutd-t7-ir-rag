# Process for the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen in the bod sorption zone of a wastewater treatment plant.

## Abstract
The present invention provides for an improved method of operating an activated sludge system whereby a significant amount of ammoniacal nitrogen is removed in the BOD sorp ton zone, which does not later appear in the system as protein or NOX. The improved method for achieving said ammoniacal nitrogen removal comprises reducing the ammoniacal nitrogen concentration of the mixed liquor in the oxidation zone to a point where the mixed liquor leaving the oxidation zone has an ammoniacal nitrogen concentration less than about 0.3 ppm. Additionally, an overall F Mâ‚€ ratio equal to or greater than about 0.05 is maintained.
