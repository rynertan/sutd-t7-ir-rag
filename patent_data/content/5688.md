# An improved selvage forming device.

## Abstract
A selvage forming device is provided with cooperating thread distributing elements 10, 14, 16 which perform relative vertical movements to each other over prescribed distances while utilizing shedding motion of harnesses for plain weave only in order to distribute at least one leno warp TY1, TY2 for one course of leno weave alternately on different lateral sides of each ground warp GY controlled by a guide needle 10 , once for each pick, by means of sliding contact of their slant edges with the leno warp, thereby forming stout leno selvages for woven cloths with simplified construction and movements of the related mechanical elements.
