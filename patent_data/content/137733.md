# Air temperature control device for the intake air of an engine.

## Abstract
An air temperature control device for the air intake of an iternal combustion engine comprises a thermo responsive actuator which is, in use, disposed to respond to the air temperature in said intake system, a first valve means operably connected to the actuator for progressive move ment in a first chamber provided with air inlet and or outlet ports between two positions, in the first of which positions a first bleed passage from the chamber is closed and in the second of which positions said first bleed passage is open permitting the passage of air to or from said ports from a second chamber provided with an air inlet which is con nected in use to a vacuum motor operable to adjust the relative proportions of ambient and pre heated air admitted to the intake system, and a second valve means to close said bleed passage and also operable to close a second bleed passage between said second chamber and a third chamber having a port which is connected in use to a vacuum source constituted by the air intake manifold of the engine, said second bleed passage being defined in pressure responsive wall member separating said second and third chambers.
