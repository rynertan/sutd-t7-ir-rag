# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A CATALYST COMPONENT USED FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF ALPHA OLEFINS

## Abstract
A process for producing a catalyst component used for the polymerization of an Î± olefin comprising treating a solid product which is obtained by reacting an organomagnesium compound with a halogenation agent in the presence of an electron donor compound, with a mixture of a halogenated silicon compound and a titanium compound, which has particle size abundant in uniformity, a good flowability and in addition a high polymerization activity and yield ratio of stereo specific polymers.
