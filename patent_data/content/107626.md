## Description
Device for dosing g.r ular products tMarticultrlz foodstuffs i1he invention relates to a device Cor dosing granular products, particularly foodstuffs such as cereals, rice, rrac aroni and the like.As is known, foodstuffs of the said type, and other products of granular structure, are sent to the consumer sealed in bags that contain a quantity in weight that is rigously constant and predeternined.Special dosing machines have been constructed to fill, also on a large scale, the said bags or containers autorrat ically and precisely. The zaid machines prevalently effect the dosing of the products in question in two separ ate stages. In the first stage, the product is delivered on the basis of relatively inexact volume or weight checks, and then, in a second stage, the aprortioned quantities are perfected by means of precise weight checks.In the said dosing operations, the first stage is a fundamentally important one since the accuracy wii h which it can be effected determines whether or not it is neces sary to resort to a second perfecting stage. However, the present dosing machines are unsatisfactory as regards the execution of the said first stage which can be accomplished by just filling to the brim receptacles that are made to pass in sequence in the region of a delivery pipe.This system of filling the receptacles to the brim can be the cause of the product, when fragile pieces of macaroni, for example breaking between the receptacles itself and the delivery pipe, the latter exercising a shearing effect. Another system for effecting the initial infeeding of the product involves the use of a vibrating surface that is also controlled by a suitable weight control system, though in tis case the times for eacb cycle become long. ormally, it is envisaged thaws in this first stage for fulling bags, containers and the like, a quantity of the product less than the final predetermined amount be deliv ered tllereto, and that the second stage for perfecting the dosed quantity, when applicable, be one in which the first supplied quantity is increased. t is obvious that in the event of it being possible to eliver the said products, straight away in the said first stage, in a virtually accurate fashion, the filling operations could be made a lot faster, with a consequent increase in the output level and a cut in the production costs. Another important problem with the present dosing machines lies in the fact that they require relatively complex and costly settingup operations and, above all, that once set, modifications that are considerable have to be made in order to vary the dosed quantities.In view of the foregoing, the basic technical task of the invention is to design a device for dosing granular products, particularly foodstuffs, with which the difficulties outlined above can be overcome.One important object that falls within the framework of the said technical task is to design a particularly precise dosing device that is able to operate on the product at the level of the delivery means, the purpose of this also being to allow extremely sinple means for receiving the product delivered to be evolved. Another important object of the invention is to design a dosing device that can easily be set and is practically of universal use, that is to say, suitable to deliver dosed quantities. that can also be quite different one from the other.A further, by no means last, object of the invention is to design a dosing device of very simple structure that can easily be made and be fitted to a dosing machime, and that, above all, neither damages nor breaks even the most delicate products. These objects and others too that will become more apparent later on are attained by the device according to the invention for dosing granular products, particularly foodstuffs, comprising a pipe for delivering the product to be dosed, the end part of sYvllicll is provided with means for closing and opening the pipe, and at least one intermediate part is drilled with holes of a size less than that of the said product, the said delivery pipe extending in a direction such as to permit a gravity descent of the granular product, suction means that terminate on the outside of the said delivery pipe via an annular channel that partially enshrouds the said pipe in the region of the said drilled part, and means which, when set in operation, interrupt the flow of air drarm in frost the said delivery pipe, through the said holes and the said annular channel, by the said suction r 3an5. mirther characteristics and advantages will emerge nore obviously from the descripticn that follows of one preferred, but not sole, embodiment for the dosing device forming the subject of the invention, illustrated purely as an unlimited example on the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a general diagrammatic view of the dosing device in question Figure 2 is a sectional view of the device, in which the operation thereof can be seen. t reference to the said figures, the dosing device is shown globally at 1.In the preferred embodinent, the device 1 comprises a substantially vertical delivery pipe 2, positioned beneath a hopper 3 containing the granular products to be dosed and sent to means for receiving them, in themselves known, shown diagrammatically in the figures. The lower extremity of the delivery pipe 2 is provided with means 5 for opening and closing the said pipe, these comprising a botton plate 6 perpendicular to the axis of the delivery pipe 2 and movable in a plane at a right angle to the said axis or rotatable around a horizontal axis 5a. O the advantage of the delivery pipe 2 is the fact that, virtually over the full length thereof, there are in it a plurality. of holes 7 of sizes less than those of the products to be dosed in practice provision is made for very smell holes 7 suitable to allow solely air and powdery particles to pass. As can be seen in Figure 2, the device 1 comprises suction means o constituted, for example, by a suction pump. Ehe suction means are conilected externally to the delivery pipe 2 through a tube , preferably provided with a flex ible section 10, and through an annular channel 11 that partially enshrouds the outer surface of the delivery pipe 2 and opens towards the holes 7.It is envisaged that using non illustrated support and fixing means, in themselves knon, the annular channel 11 can be positioned and restrained with precision at a chosen height along the delivery pipe 2, thanks also the said flexible section 10 of the tube 9. It is also envisaged that along the tube 9 means which, when set in operation, interrupt the flow of air drawn in from the delivery pipe 2 by the suction means 8, be positioned. The said air flow interruption means are, in the example given herein, constituted by an on off valve 12.The operation of the dosing device according to the invention is described below, with reference in particular toFigure 2. The annular channel 11 is placed along the outer surface of the delivery pipe 2 at a position such aS to define a terminal part of the said delivery pipe 2, the inside volume of which virtually corresponds to the volume of the granular product to be delivered per dosing operation.The extension in height of the said terminal part can be readily determined, also in an experimental fashion, by varying the position in height of the annular channel 11. Jith h the bottom plate 6 kept in the closed position, the granular product is made to go dornxards from the hopper 3 in such a way as to fill the whole delivery pipe 2.The suction means 8 are then set in operation, with the consequent creation of a vortex in the region of the area of the delivery pipe 2 enshrouded by the annular channel 11. The said vortex does not cause the granular product to be expelled, because of the reduced dimensions of the holes 7, but creates a compactness of the said granular product in the region of the said annular channel 11.In actual practice, as shown in Figure 2, the granular product becomes denser and attaches itself to the delivery pipe 2 forming a sort of plug that blocks the said delivery pipe 2. By rotating the plate 6 it is then possible to cause the dosed quantity of the granular product contained in the delivery pipe 2 below the aiiirnlar channel 11, to above down wards at a point where the means 4 for receiving it are located. 31e said blockage prevents the product above the annular ciannel 11 from flowing into the said means 4. he downward movement of the granular product placed below the granular channel 11 is not obstructed by the said eddy effect since, thanks to the presence of the holes 7 over virtually the full length of the delivery pipe 2, air can penetrate into the said pipe in order to fill the space left free bur the granular product that is dropping down wards.n a further operating stage, the bottom plate 6 is once a Thin placed in the closed position and, subsequently, the on off valve 12 is set in operation to interrupt the suction effect in the region of the annular channel 11. As a consequence of this, the said blocking plug disintegrates and the granular product drops along the delivery pipe 2 until the latter has been completely filled.With the suction effect duly restored in the region of the annular channel 11, the cycle described previously can be repeated and a further dosed quantity of the granular product can be delivered.The invention fulfills the objects proposed and offers numerous, important advantages. rt1he dosing device in question operates in the region of the delivery means and not in the region of the means 4 that receive the product, and consequently it is always impossible for a quantity greater than that predetermined, to move downwards. tglurthermore the dosing is extremely precise and easy to vary by simply displacing in height the annular channel 11. rXhe device offers maximum hygiene guarantee since use is not made of means that are placed in contact with the products to be dosed and, indeed, the vortex effect can bring about the removal of any minor impurity present in the delivery pipe 2.It is stressed that with the said device, mechanical means for separating one dosed qwlntity from the other are not used and that it is possible, therefore, to handle, without any danger, extremely delicate or fragile products. emphasis is also given to the fact that the dosing device according to the invention is of particular simplicity and that it can easily be fitted to a dosing machine, while the means 4 for receiving the product can be of any struct ure.The invention as outlined above is liable to undergo numerous modifications and variants, all of which falling within the framework of the concepts of the invention. Furthermore, all parts say be substituted with others of technical equivalence. In practice, the materials used and the dimensions may be any to suit the requirements.
