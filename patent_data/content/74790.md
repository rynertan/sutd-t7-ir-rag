## Description
TITLE PLASTIC TREATER.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improvements in plastic treating devices. In one type of Corona discharge plastic treater, an electrode is positioned adjacent to the plastic to be treated so as to form an air gap therebetween and a power supply provides AC power to the electrode so as to inonize the air gap and produce a Corona discharge. Prior art power supplies for plastic treaters have included motor generators, spark gap oscillators, vacuum tubes, and solid state circuitry. These systems have been characterized by relatively high cost and complexity. SUtSRY OF THE INVEN TION There is a primary object of the invention to provide a power supply for plastic treaters which is simple, reliable, inexpensive and relatively small in size and weight. A further object of the invention is to provide a power supply which is relatively flexible and capable of powering capacity loads having a wide range of electrical characteristics. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description taken thereof with the accompanying drawing. In general terms, the invention comprises a power supply for a plastic treater including a source of DC power, a transformer, a unidirectional switching device which couples the DC source to the primary winding of the transformer, a control coupled to the unidirectional switching device for providing gate signals to the switching device in relation to the load power requirements, and the secondary transformer winding connected to an electrode which presents a capacity load. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 schematically illustrates the power supply for plastic treater in accordance with the present invention FIGURE 2 is the equivalent circuit. of the apparatus illustrated in FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 shows a typical hysteresis characteristic for the core of the transformer illustrated in FIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 shows the voltage and current and the circuit of FIGURE 1 when a core having the hysteresis characteristic ofFIGURE 3 is employed and FIGURE 5 shows the voltage and current characteristics of the circuit of FIGURE 1 when a core having linear characteristics is employed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As seen in FIGURE 1, the treating apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the invention includes a power supply 10 coupled to a highly contluctive electrode 12 which is spaced from a rotatable drum 14 having a suitable dielectric material 15 attached to its surface. The plastic material 16, which is to have its surface treated, ivs relceived on the dielectric material 15. The electrode 12 is positioned relative to material 16 such that an air gap of approximately 1 16 of an indo is maintained therebetween.Power supply 10 provides power to the electrode 12 to break down the air gap and thereby produce a Corona discharge which, in a well known way, treats the surface of the plastic material so that labels, ink, various coatings and other laminates may be adhered thereto. The power supply 10 coiuxerts DC power to AC power and is connected to the electrode 12 by a transfprmer T1. More particularly, the power supply 1O includes a D.C. source comprising an alternating current source 18 and a full wave rectifier 20. Conductors 21 and 22 connect the source 17 to the primary winding 23 of transformer T1 through the anode cathode circuit of silicon controlled rectifier SCR. The gate electrode of theSCR is connected to a control circuit 24 having a first pair of input conductors 26 connected across a resistor R1 connected in conductor 21 between the output terminal of rectifier 20 and a filter capacitor C1 which is connected between conductors 21 and 22.The second input conductors 28 of control 24 is connected to the secondary winding 30 of an isolation transformer T2 whose primary is connected across the primary winding 23 of transformerT1. The secondary winding 30 of transformer T1 is connected to electrode 12 and is linked to the primary winding 23 by a core 32. The control 24 is conventional an therefore will not be discussed in detail. It will be sufficient for understanding the operation of the invention to state that. the current flowing and resistor R1 will be proportional to the load current flowing in the secondary winding 31 of the transfornier T1 to electrode 12 and hence will reflect the power requirements of the load. The control 24 will sense the potential across R1 and compare the same to a referenced potential. The frequency of firing pulses to the g ate of the SCR is then determined by the relationship of these potential signals.The transformer T2 senses the voltage across the primary 23 of transistor T1 and provides a proportional signal to the control 24 which in turn insures that the firing signal frequency will not result in a voltage across transformer T1 which exceeds safe limits. In actual practice, th frequency of firing signals will be in the order of 5 20 kilohertz with about 10 kilohertz being typical. FIGURE 2 shows an equivalent circuit to the treater ofFIGURE 1 wherein the transformer T1 is represented as a three terminal device comprising conductors L1, L2 mnd L3. The load is represented by capacitor C2 and resistor R2. Inductors L1 andL2 represent the primary and secondary leakage inductances, respectively and inductor L3 represents the magnetizing inductance. The magnetizing ind actance L3 is highly dependent upon the type of core construction used in the transformer Tl. For example, when the core 32 ha, the hysteresis characteristic shown in Figure 3, the magnetizing inductance L3 will be highly nonlinear. On the other hand, the magnetizing inductance will be relatively linear when the core 32 has a significant air gap. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the inductance L3 is very high when compared to the inductances L1 and L2. A typical capacitive load such as that presented by a plastic treater, will be more complex than the capacitor C2 in the resistor R2 shown in FIGURE 2 but for purposes of understanding the invention, this representation is adequate. FIGURE 4 illustrates the voltage and current in the circuit of FIGURE 2 when a core having the hysteresis charac teristic of FIGURE 3 is employed. At time TO the gate signal is presented to the SCR which becomes conducThV1ve sSoUt at a substantially sinusoidal current pulse flows during the intervalTO T1 as determined primarily by he magnitude of the voltage E across source 17, the inductances L1 and L2 and the capicitance ofC2. When the current 11 becomes zero the SçR will cease conducting so that I1 will cease flowing until the next gate signal at timeT4. The secondary current I2 is shown in Figure 4 to have substantially the same wave shape as Il during the time TO T1, differing therefrom mainly by the transformer turns ratio. The voltage V2 will change rapidly, attaining a maximum value near the termination of I1. During the interval T1 T2, the volage V2 is sustained at substantially a coastant level as a result of the capacitive nature of the load 2, R2, there being only a small drop in voltage as a result of the low current flowing from load 12 through the high impedence L3. At timeT2, the core 32 will become saturated causing an abrupt drop in the impedence of L3.This rapidly discharges the capacitive load, causting the negative current pulse I2 between the timesT2 T3. Finally, at time T3, infuctance L3 reverts to a high impedence state so that between the time T3 T4, the voltage V2 is again substantially constant, becoming slightly less negative as the low current flows through conductance L3. At time T4, the next cycle is initiated. FIGURE 5 shows the priory and secondary current and secondary voltage wave forms when the core 32 has a significant air gap so that L3 is relatively linear. Here, the discharge of the capacitor C 2 through the conductor L 3 during the timeT1 T4 is relatively more gradual than in the embodiment of FIGURE 4. It can also be seen that the negative portion of the current wave form of I2 is relatively longer and has a lower amplitude in FIGURE 5 than in FIGURE 4. In both embodiments, it can be seen that a relatively hiyh frequency high voltage alternating wave as is required by a plastic treater or an ozonator can be obtained using transformers having a differing range of power characteristics.In particular, the embodiments of the invention provide alternating voltage waves in the range of 10 kilohertz and an amplitude of about 10,000 volts from a power supply system which is relatively compact and inexpensive. Further, varying transformer configurations may be employed depending upon frequency, cooling and voltage requirements. In this regard, the inductances L1 and L2 and to a lesser extent 93 should be made compatible with the frequency voltage and power levels desired. The techniques for determining these parameters are well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art. Additionally, the SCR should be selected with current and voltage apabilities consistent with the duty imposed, as illustrated byFIGURE 4. While only a few embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended to be limited thereby but only by the scope of the appended claims.
