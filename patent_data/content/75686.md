# Nacelle pylon configuration for an aircraft and method of using the same.

## Abstract
A below wing engine nacelle mounted by a pylon forwardly of a wing having a rearward sweep, The pylon upper outboard edge that extends forwardly of the wing is formed with a relatively sharp radius of curvature. Thus, airflow which flows over the top of the pylon in an outboard direction separates over the sharp pylon edge to form a vortex which passes beneath the wing adjacent the outboard surface of the pylon. This vortex maintains attached flow at the outboard pylon surface immediately beneath the wing to reduce drag.
