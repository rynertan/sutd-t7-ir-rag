## Description
Device for discharging an object from one or more holders travelling along a Predetermined track with adjustment of the location of discharge. The invention relates to a device for discharging an object from a holder travelling along a predetermined track, which holder is able to take two positiom in the first of which, the retaining position, it can contain and retain an object and in the second of which, the non retaining position it cannot retain an object, so that it discharges an object when passing from the retaining in the non retaining position, along said track at least one discharge controlling member being present that is movable in two conditions, in the first of which the passive one, it does not influence the holder when the.latter paSses .i.t and in the second one of which it cooperates with the holder to cause it to pass from the retaining position in the non retaining position, a means being present to modify the location along said track where the discharge controlling member becomes effective.Such a device has been depicted in the US PS 3,754,670 to Iosterd. In this device disturbancies due to velocity variations of the holder are counteracted by a holds , member that is brought in the trajectory of movement of a part of the holder that moves in a direction opposite to the travelling direction of the holder. This means that at low velocities of the holder said part of the holder is delayed in carrying out its movement, so that the location where the holder has sufficiently moved to discharge an object is displaced with respect to the location where the discharge would occur if no such holding up member should be present in that sense, that a reduction occurs of the distance between the locations at which discharge occurs with high and low velocities of the holder.The invention is based on the insight that this knovt displace ment of the location, where a holder really discharges with respect to the location inhere the discharged object will land can also be obtained by a well chosen displacement of the location of the discharge corolig ebr. s sBec allXr is true for the problems occurring with starting and stopping the device.Accordingly the invention provides a device as described in the first paragraph of this specification, which is characterized in that saidEMI2.1 means contains a velocity measuring means to measure the velocity of said holder and an adjustment means for adjusting said discharge controlling member in dependence on the measured velocity.A further elaboration of the invention provides a device for discharging an object from a holder travelling along a predetermined track, at least one receiving station being located along said track, which holder is able to take two positions in the first of which, the retaining position, it can contain and retain an object and in the second of which, the non retaining position it cannot retain an object, so that it discharges an object when passing from the retaining in the non retaining position, along said track at least one discharge controlling member being present that is movable in two conditions, in the first of which the passive one, it does not influence the holder when the latter passes it and in the second one of which it cooperates with the holder to cause it to pass from the retaining position in the non retaining position, a means being present to modify the location along said track where the discharge controlling member becomes effective, characterized in that said adjustment means contains a velocity measuring means to measure the velocity of said holder and an adjustment means for adjusting the relative position of said discharge control member and said receiving station in the direction of said track in dependence on the measured velocity.Preferably the velocity measuring means contains a pick up member adapted to derive signals from equidistant locations of a member carrying out a movement corresponding to that of the holder and that the frequency of the output signal of the pick up member is fed to control means for the adjustment means of the relative position of said discharge control menber and said receiving station in the direction of said track in dependence on the measured velocity. Such a pick up member can be used in some instances for other purposes, whereas it is also possible to use in the invention any pick up member of the kind which is already present for other purposes.It is remarked that in the time period between the filing of the Dutch Patent Application 8303119 on which priority a. part of this application is based and the actual filing date of this application the zhropean Patent Application 0.098.732 was published on January 18, 1984 claiming priority from July 1, 1982, based on the US PA 394,162. In this intercalated application for the special purpose of transferring eggs the broad idea is claimed of varying the position of the discharge control means with respect to a receiving station according to the speed of the holders along the track.The term according to the speed is elucidated on hand of two examples. In the first one a stepper motor is controlled by an operator, the speed of said motor displacing a support for the discharge control members by means of hydraulic system, which with some retardation causes the discharge control members to occupy certain locations prescribed by the speed of the stepper motor determined by the activity of the operatnr. In the second embodiment a frame bearing the discharge control members is displaced to a position desired in view of a particular motor speed. This frame is connected to a speed control for the drive motor of the device. This means that the position of the speed control is unambigiously related to the position of the discharge control members. Poth embodiments are less suitable for solving the problems occurring with starting or stopping the device or involuntary deviations of the drive motor speed. ith the first embodiment only a means is provided for allowing the operator to adjust the position of the discharge control members, whereas with the second erilbodiment no solution has been given for the often considerable back lash between the actual speed of a motor and the addust.lent of its speed control, which back lash may occur with starting and stopping a loaded motor.In order to keep this back lash small it will be necessary to change the motor speeds only gradually,which is an important disadvantage, specially with stopping a device.Because no indication of the use of the said features is indicated in the said intercalated patent application, it may be supposed on base of the above that they mainly serve the purpose to obtain a device having a variable working speed.Anyhow the invention as defined in the above sees to a permanent relation between the working speed of the device of and the location discharge control members without any need of any exterior control activity of any operator. A further advantage of the invention is, that it is possible to start and stop the device in the normal way, which means higher speed of starting and stopping, the latter feature being of special importance when quick stops may be necessary.Because only a limited number of contracting states have been designed in the intercalate european Patent Application it forms only a prior right for these designed contracting states. In the non designed states this intercalate europeanPatent Application does not play a part, so that in these non designed states claims 14 and 15 of this, our, patent application cannot be invalidated by the intercalated application. In cases the starting and stopping problems are practically the only ones to be solved, for instance when applying the invention to a device having only little variation in sQedy state working speed a practical solution according to the invention consists in that said device further contains a start and stop device, a time control circuit being present, the input of which is controlled by the said start and stop device and the output of which controls the said adjustment means. The invention allows for higher working speeds in devices which have a well defined location for receiving each of the dropped objects, as for instance is the case with USPS 4,383,613, to Van Kattenbroek. It is remarked that the term adjusting the location of the discharge control members is intended to include not only a physical linear displacement of such members but each and avery means with which the location of the active part of a discharge control member is displaced, for instance by having the control member consisting of a plurality of sub members and activating different sub members or a member carrying out a movement different from a displacement parallel to said track but resulting in another part of said member to be in the position to cooperate With a holder to discharge it. The effect of the invention is always obtained with modification of the location, where the discharge control member causes the holder to move to its non retaining position.A preferred means for adjusting the discharge control members contains a reversable electric motor cooperating with a screw spindle, which is connected to a support for said discharge control member.When applying the invention it is possible that at relatively high travelling speeds of the holders the displacement of the discharge control members may become rather important if complete compensation of the effects of these speeds is desired. In some instances, for instance of no sufficient room is available for this large displacement or if it is difficult or expensive to obtain sufficient accuracy of the adjustment of the discharge members, it is possible to combine the invention with a.construction analogous to that of the cited US IS 3,754,670 to l osterd. Such a combination leads to a further embodiment of the invention consisting in a device for discharging an object from a holder travelling along a predetermined track, at least one receiving station being located along said track, which holder is able to take two positions in the first of which, the retaining position, it can contain and retain an object and in the second of which, the non retaining position it cannot retain an object, so that it discharges an object when passing from the retaining in the non retaining position, along said track at least one discharge controllir. mer.zber being present that is movable in to conditions, in the first of which the passive one, it does not influence the holder when the latter passes it and in the second one of which it cooperates with the holder to cause it to pass from the retaining position in the non retaining position, a means being present to modify the location along said track where the discharge controlling neber becomes effective, I said holder including further a means movable along a predetermined path of movement when the holder moves from its retaining to its non retaining position, a hold up member being mounted at a predetermined location along said track, said holding up member being adapted to be brought in the said predetermined path at a predetermined tine period after said movable means passed said predetermined location, said adjustment means containing a velocity measuring means to measure the velocity of said holder, characterized in that said adjustment means is adapted to become active to adjust said relative position at a predetermined velocity of the holder.Because with this embodiment the low velocity region is covered by the activity of the hold up member, a simple embodiment of the invention is in this instance obtained in that a time control circuit is present, the input of which is controlled by the start and stop device and the output of which controls the said adjustment means. given speeding up a device of the type of the cited US 25 3,754,61 pr US PS 3,745,260 Both to Mdsterd . , it may occur that difficulties present themselves with respect to the removal of the discharged objects.In the said US PS 3,749,260 the discharge control members are mounted to a rotatable control sleeve and this sleeve activates a device for bering a row of dropped objects, when it is in its last position from which it returns to its starting position. Application of the invention allows in a special ernbodiment of the invention for a sooner availability of a control signal to activate the device for lowering the row of dropped objects.Correspondingly a preferred embodiment of the invention providesEMI7.1 a device for discharging objects from holders travelling the one after the other along a predetermined track, each holder being able to take two positions namely a retaining position in which it can retain an object and a non retaining position in which it cannot retain an object, so that it discharges an object when moving from the retaining to the non retaining position, each holder further being provided with a discharge member which, when activated, causes the holder to pass from the retaining to the nonretaining position, a plurality of release stations being located in a row along said track, each release station containing a discharge abutment, said discharge abutments being located on a cylindrical control sleeve in successive angular positions, said sleeve being rotatably mounted with its axis parallel to said track in such a way that rotation of the sleeve causes the one abutment after the other to be located in the trajectory of the discharge members, a driving device for said control sleeve being present to cause said sleeve to rotate an angular step when a holder cooperates with a discharge abutment, said step being adapted to bring the next discharge abutment in the said trajectory of the discharge control members and to rotate said sleeve back in its starting position after the last abutment has cooperated with the discharge member of a holder, said device being further provided with a movable receiving means for a row of objects, a movement controlling device being present for said receiving means to cause it to remove a completed row of objects, which movement controlling device is itself controlled by the sleeve rotation, characterized in that an.adjustment means is present to axially displace said sleeve in dependence on the travelling velocity of said holders and in that said sleeve is provided with a control activating means cooperating with a signal generating means, which is stationary located in the region of said control activating means, the latter having an angular displacement over its longitudinal length to initiate the backward rotation of the sleeve to its starting position and to activate an actuator means to cause the removal of said row of objects. This embodiment is also applicable in case the axial displacement of the sleeve is not directly related to the travelling velocity of the holders, but to the time lapsed since the start or stop command for the device. Uhe invention in the following is elucidated on hand of the drawing in which Figure 1 shows a schematical elevation of a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 shows a cross section taken over the line Il Il in figure 1 Figure 3 shows an elevation corresponding to figure 1 but in an other position of the device Figure 4 schematically shows the essential elements of a second embodiment of the invention Figure 5 shows a scheme of a circuit for controlling the location of the discharge control members Figure 6 shows an elevation of a third embodiment of the invention Figure 7 shows a further detail of this third embodiment Figure 8 shows still another detail of the said embodiment Figure 9 shows a detail elucidating the hold up activity in a first position Figure 10 corresponds to figure 9, but in a further position andFigure 11 shows schematically a system for applying the embodiment of the invention of figures 6 10 in case the displacement of the discharge control abutments is also dependent on the time lapsed since starting andstopping the device.In fig. 1 3 an example of the invention relating to egg handling has been shown.Reference 1 indicates a beam which is longitudinally displaceable in gliding supports 2 and by means of support members 3 bears a sleeve 4 carrying a number of discharge control members in the form of abutments 51,52,53,54,55,and 56 respectively. Of these members 56 is in the position in which cooperation is possible with a discharge member 6 of the holder 11, which is connected to an endless chain 23 moving in the direction of the arrow adjacent it. aThe discharge member 6 is rotatable about pivot 7 and contains a lever 8 cooperating with abutment 56 and a lever bearing at its end a hook 9 cooperating with a pawl 10. The holder 11 bears at its lower end an egg gripper 12. The holder 11 with the egg gripper 12 are part of a balance vide fig. 2 having a weighing beam 13, a pivot 14 and a parallellogram link 15. At the back side of the weighing beam 13 a counterweight 16 and a tare weight 17 are mounted, said beam being further provided with permanent damping magnets not shown which cooperate with a strip 18 of well conducting metal, for instance copper, to damp the balance.The balance is mounted to a yoke 19, in fig. 1 schematically indicated with interrupted lines, guided by guide rolls 20,21 and 22 and moved by blehain 23.Though the construction of the balance and its mounting are completely known, for instance from the US PS 4,383,613 toVan Kettenbroek in the following they will be described shortly.When the sleeve 4 is controlled such that one of the dis charge control abutments 51 , in the drawing 56 comes in the trajectory of the movement of a discharge member 6, this member will be pivoted causing hook 9 to liberate pawl 10, by reason of which the gripper 12 is opened by its own spring bias.It is remarked that the holder 11 supports a guide roll 24 cooperating with guides 25, so that its height position is well defined.The beam 1 is connected to an arm of a kneelever 27 with a fixed pivot 26 and a second arm which at its end is connected to the output rod 28 of an actuating device 29. This device preferably contains a reversable electric motor cooperating with a screw spindle.In fig. 1 the position has been shown in which the velocity of the holders is very small. This means that the gripper 12 shown in fig. 1 with solid lines will be opened after its discharge member 6 has hit upon the discharge control abutment 56 by reason of the movement toward the right of chain 23, and drop its. egg 30 shown in solid lines in fig. 1. Because the velocity of the holders is very small this egg falls almost vertically, as has been indicated with interrupted lines at 31.In this embodiment of the invention the egg is received in the first of a row receiving pockets, one of which is schematically indicated at 32. A row of juxtapositioned pockets is formed by two members 34 pivotable about shafts 33 and each provided for each pocket with two fingers 35 directed obliquely downward.Though possibly superflous it is mentioned that when opening the gripper 12 the guide roll 24 pivots away from the guides 25 so that the holder moves upward.After discharge of holder 11 the sleeve 4 is stepped one rotational step by known means, not shown, and not directly related to the invention, for instance depicted in the US PS 3,749,260 to Mosterd. After this the discharge control abutment 55 is in the trajector y of the discharge members 6 of the holders.In fig. 3 the case has been shown that the holders travel with a considerable velocity from left to right. Also in this case the arm 8 of discharge member 6 will hit the discharge control abutment 56 by reason of which the egg 36 is released.This happens, however, at a location with respect to the receiving pockets 32, which differs from that of fig. 1.This difference is due to the fact that the actuating device which is controlled in dependence on the velocity of the holders 11 has raised its output rod by reason of which kneelever 27 pivots about pivot 26 and beam 1 is shifted to the left. Because the sleeve 4 is mounted to the supports 3 connected to the beam 1 also the discharge control abutments 51 56 have been shifted to the left.The device has been devised such, that the leftward shift equals the horizontal distance covered by an object starting with the velocity of the holders and falling down a vertical distance equalling the height difference between an egg in a holder 11 and an egg received by a receiving pocket 32.The end position of egg 36 has been indicated in interrupted lines at 37. As an example a height difference of 2 cm and a horizontal travel speed of 79 cm per second, which at the moment is rather high for for instance egg graders, will lead to a theoretical shift to the left of about 5 cm.It will be clear that in case the beam 1 had not been shifted leftward the egg 36 would have been released in a position about above the egg position indicated at 37, so that in that instance the egg would have come down at the right side of the last receiving pocket 32.On the other hand it is not possible to mount beam 1 permanently in the position indicated in fig. 3, because in that instance at very low travelling speeds several eggs will be dropped at a wrong location. An egg grading machine of the type shown has for instance a speed up time of about four seconds, which means that with a final travelling speed at which eight holders pass the same point in a second, it is possible that a considerable number of eggs of about ten or more does not reach the pocket allotted to them, which gives a considerable chance of breakage. It is remarked that in the above no consideration has been given to any delay between the activation of discharge member 6 and the opening of holder 11, up to the moment that the egg contained in it can freely fall down. If such a delay occurs, and theoretically this is always true, it will increase the shift necessary to let the object come down at the same location. This is so, because in the delay period between the activation of a discharge member and the attainment of a condition of free fall of the object a faster travelling holder will cover a greater distance than a slower travelling one.Fig. 4 shows the essential parts of the invention in case that at each discharge location an independently activatable discharge control member is present. these members for instance movable parts of electro magnetic relays are mounted to a beam 1 which is slidably supported in glide bearings 2 and can be moved too and fro by an actuating device 29 .The discharge control members 38 each have an extendable part 39 which can be brought into the trajectory of the discharge members 40 of holders 41, which are mounted to a chain 42, which in fig. 4 moves from left to right. Uhen an extendable part 39 in the way shown for part 395 is brought into the trajectory of the discharge members 40 of holders 41 and a discharge member runs into an extended part 39 a discharge is realized. The objects dropped from the holders 41 will then fall into the related pockets 43. In fig. 4 the position has been shown in which the pockets 43 are located straight below the discharge control members 38, which position corresponds to a very low velocity or even a stand still of the chain 42.When chain 42 increases its speed toward the right the actuating member 29 becomes active to push the beam 1 to the left, so that also the members 38 with their extendable parts 39 shift to the left and consequently the holders 41 discharge at an earlier moment and in a leftward displaced position, so that an object dropped from a holder 41 may follow a parabolic trajectory to reach properly the pocket allotted to it.It will be clear that the moment of cooperation of an extended part 39 and a discharge control member 40 occurs earlier because of the leftward displacement of the extended part 39.Quite remarkably this phenomenon does not impede the working of the device in case the command to extend a part 39 is given a predetermined time period before the related discharge member 40 is in the position to hit the said part 39. This is quite normal for devices of the type of fig. 4. The reason why the invention can be applied to such a device without modification of the activating moment of the discharge control members 38 in comparison with devices having no such displacement of said members 38 is, that the distance travelled by.the holders 41 in the said predetermined time period is proportional to the travelling velocity of said holders and that the leftward shift of the discharge control members can easily also be proportional to this velocity or nearly so.By reason of this the mutual relation of the parts 39 on the one hand and the discharge control members 40 at the other hand is not essentially changed, which precludes a wrong position or a part 39 with respect to a member 40 by reason of the leftward shift of the member 39.Such a wrong position would occur for instance if activating of a leftward shifted part 39 would occur at the moment the member 40, with which it has to cooperate, has already passed it.An embodiment of an electrical circuit suitable for use in the invention has been shown in fig. 5. In this figure reference 44 indicates a toothed gear cooperating with an electromagnetic pck up device 45. The gear 44 is connected to a driving mechanism for chain 23 or 42 and rotates at a speed proportional to the travelling velocity of the related chain.By reason of this the pick up 45 generates a series pulses having a repetition rate proportional to the said travelling velocity. Pick up 45 is connected to a pulse shaper 46, which is connected to a frequency multiplier, for instance based on the phase lock principle, which multiplies the repetition rate with a fixed number for instance sixteen. A signal having the multiplied frequency is then fed to digital filters 481,482,483,and 484. Por instance 481 has a passing region of 0 1000 Hz 482 of 500 2000 Hz 483 of 1500 3000 Hz and 484 of 2500 4000 Hz.Therefor with a signal of 0 500 Hz only input 491 will carry a signal, at frequenc es of 500 1000 Hz both inputs 491 and will carry a signal in the region of 1000 1500 Uz only input 492 in the region of 1500 2000 Hz both 492 and 493 in the region of 2000 2500 Hz only 493 in the region of 2500 3000 Hz both 493 and 494 and finally in the region of 3000 4000 Hz only input 494. 50The logic circuit translates this information by activating none of the lines 51 when no signal is received on any of its inputs, activating the upper 51 in the frequency region of 0 500 Hz and so an until the lowermost line 51 is activated at a frequency in the region of 3000 4000 Hz. The lines 51 are connected to a decimal binary converter 52 giving at its output lines a binary value of the eight different values carried by lines 51, which binary value is transmitted to a comparator 53.A value indicating the position of the beam 1 or 1 is the other value to be compared in comparator 53. This latter signal is generated by four switches 591592595 and 594.These switches can be activated by a switch control member 60 connected to the beam 1 or 1 . when the member 60 moves downward in fig. 5 the following conditions will successively occur None of the switches closed only switch 591 closed both switches 591 and 592 closed only switch 592 closed both switches 592 and 593 closed only switch 593 closed both switches 593 and 594 closed and finally only switch 594 closed.The logic circuit 61 which is analogeous to circuit 50 activates the one line 62 after the another when member 60 causes the switches 59 to close as indicated above and decimal binary converter 63 issues a binary value corresponding to the position of member 60. When the comparison of the velocity signal issuing from converter 52 and the position signal issuing from converter 63 in the comparator 53 indicates that the rotational velocity of gear 44 angconse quently the travelling velocity of the chain 23 or 42 is higher than corresponds to the position of beam 1 or 1 an output signal occurs on line 541. In case the velocity signal and the position signal balance, indicating that the velocity of the chain and the position of the beam are well matched, a signal occurs on line 542 whereas a too small velocity of the chain in view of the position of the beam leads to the occurrence of a signal on line 543. On base of these signals the logic circuit 55 controls the amplifier 561 or 562 feeding output amplifier stages 571 and 572 resp., which cause the motor M to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Logical circuit 55 is provided with an adjustment member 58 to adapt the circuit to the back lash of motor M, which means the distance over which it rotates on after termination of its energizing. This feature improves the stability of the device and prevents hunting or oscillatory energizing of the motor.Practice has shown that in a very short time correspondence between the chain s velocity and.the beam s position can be obtained. If the power supply of the whole device is cut off it is theoretically possible that the device comes to a stand still whereas the beam has not been restored in its rest position. When again starting the device in practice sufficiently time is available to restore the position of the beam, specially because a device of the type normally starts at a very low velocity procuring sufficient time to allow the beam 1 or 1 to reach the positionlcorresponding to this low velocity. Another solution for this problem is to use an independent energy supply for the circuit of fig.5. An embodiment of the invention which at this moment is preferred, is schematically shown in fig. 6 8 inclusive.In this embodiment an extremely efficient combination of the basic inventive idea with the main features of the US PS 3,754,640EMI15.1 US PS 3,749,260 and US PS 3,525,195 all to Mosterd. As a matter of fact in this embodiment the length of the shift of the beam is reduced by covering part of the discrepancy in landing locations of the objects by a means in some respects analogoua to the means shown in US PS 3,754,640 to osterd, whereas a new use is made of the rotational moveyient of the control sleeve of US PS 3,749,260 to hosterd in combination with its translatory movement according to the basic idea of this invention to add some features to said latter device to be able to make a device according to the US PS 3,525,195 to losterd suitable for higher machine speeds.In fig. 6 the beam 1 is slidable in glide bearings 2 . This beam can be shifted longitudinally. Because fig. 6 shows a view from the inside of the device in order to make some details visible, whereas fig. 1 and 3 show views from the outside of the device, the holders not shown move from right to left in fig. 6. Though in fig. 6 the beam 1 has been shown in the position it takes at the highest travelling velocities of the holders in the following firstly the device and its working at lower travelling velocites will be described.The guides 25 for guide rolls 24 correspond to those of fig. 1 3.As in principle is known from the cited US PS 3,749,260 toMosterd a control sleeve 4 is mechanically biased in one rotational direction and stopped by stop pawls 64. The pawls 641,642,643,644,645 and 646 correspond to the pawls used in the cited US PS 3,749,260, so that their function will only shortly be repeated with the aid of fig. 7, whereas the function of stop pawl 647 will be discussed in detail.Fig. 7 shows a schematical view from the left of pawl 641 partly in cross section over the line VIl VIl in fig. 6. Pawl 641 is pivotably mounted about a shaft 65. Each pawl 64 is by means of a link 66 coupled to a pawl control member 671 677 inclusive, pivotably mounted about pivots 68.The oblique lower sides of these pawl control members are adapted to be engaged by the rolls 24 of the holders, which rolls are guided between the guides 25 .The pawls 641 647 all are provided with a stop surface of which that of pawl 641 in fig. 7 has been indicated at 691. These stop surfaces can cooperate with radial surfaces of detents 701,702,703 etc. In fig. 7 sleeve 4 is mechanically biased in counter clockwise direction, so that stop surface 691 of pawl 641 prevents sleeve 4 to rotate counter clockwise. Sleeve 4 is further provided with discharge control abutments 711,712,713,714,715 and 716 it being remarked that only six such abutments are present, whereas there are seven pawls 64, seven pawl.control members 67 and seven detents 70.Further each pawl control member 671 676 has at its left side a holding up surface, thei function of which will be explained further on.As best is visible in fig. 8 sleeve 4 is connected to two strings 72 and 73. String 72 is tensioned by means of a torsion spring 74. String 73 is connected to a pivot 75 supported in a knee lever 76 which is fixedly mounted to a pivotable shaft 77 supported in bearings 78 and 79. A link 80, corresponding to the lower arm of knee lever 76 is also fixedly mounted to shaft 77. A rod 81 parallel to shaft 77 is mounted between 76 and 80. A hook member having at its upper side a hook 83 is vertically movable up and down.The pick up 85 controls an electromagnet 86 coupled to a lever 87 pivotable about pivot 88 and provided with an end surface 89 engaging a radial detent 90 on a disc 91 mounted to a shaft 92. A cam 93 is also mounted to shaft 92. tides cam cooperates with a cam follower 94 mounted to a lever 97 which is pivotable about pivot 95. The lever 97 is by means of a pivot connection 96 connected to bar 82. tension spring 98 keeps follower 94 in engagement with cam 93.The working of the device of fig. 6 8 is the following charting from the shown position a roll 24 will move between the guides 25. The fact that these guides at their right hand end are oblique is only for constructional reasons to spare machine length, because quite a number of devices as snow in these figures are placed the one after the another. This obliquiness, however, does not affect the invention, it being clear that the position of pawl control m5r lber 677 with respect to the guides 25 is the same as that of pawl control members 671 676, whereas also due to a somewhat greater length of link 667 than that of the other links 66 the position of pawl 647 with respect to the sleeve 4 is the same as that of the pawls 641 646 e The first roll 24 coming from the right will successively lift all pawl control members 677 671.Lifting pawls 647, 646 etc. up till 642 does not have any influence, because none of the pawls 647 642 cooperates with a radial surface of its related detent 707 702 but lifting pawl 641 will result in rotation counter clockwise of sleeve 4 in fig. 7.This rotation is then stopped by pawl 642 engaging the radial surface of detent 702. This goes on until sleeve 4 is so far rotated, that pawl 646 cooperates with detent 706. In this position and in the shown position of the beam 2 , which corresponds to high travelling velocities, an electromagnetically detectable member 84 is in a position with respect to an electro magnetic pick up element 85 to induce in said element a signal that by means of an actuating member pulls rod 82 down. Because during the stepwise rotation of sleeve 4 rod 81 has moved upward hook 83 will move rod 81 downwards and .1 viaFods76 and 73 rotate sleeve 4 back to its original position, in which it is kept by pawl 641 when rod 82 and hook 83 move again upward in their original position. Whenffepick up member 85 has responded to a detectable element 84 on sleeve 4 it energizes electro magnet 86.After actuating magnet 86 lever 87 moves its end surface 89 away from detent 90 so that shaft 92, which is under permanent bias of a clutch 99 vide fig. 6 is rotated one revolution. This causes rod 82 to move downward and upward again under influence of tension spring 98.The holders used in this embodiment are of the .type used and elucidated on hand of fig. 1 3 and will, when their discharge member 6 hits on a discharge control abutment 711 716 start a discharge movement with which their roll 24 is pivoted in fig. 6 to the right, ith small velocities the beam 1 will be in a position left from the one of fig. 6, but the cooperation between the pawl control members, the pawls and the control sleeve 4 is not affected by this shift.If consequently the velocity of the holders is small the pawl control members will fall back in the shown position before the considered roll 24 has moved sufficiently backward to pass below the related pawl control member. This can only happen with the pawl control members 671 676 inclusive, because 677 is not followed by a discharge control abutment 70, so that also no holder can be activated in its neighbourhood.The other pawl control members 671 676 will, however, b holding up the related roll 24 delay the opening of the gripper, which means that also the object Will be dropped somewhat more to the left due to the holding up activity of the pawl control members 671676, which consequently can be considered to be hold up members, it being clear that for fulfilling the delay task it is not necessary that a holding up member has also a task in controlling the pawls. The cited US PS 3,754,670 to Mosterd shows for instance hold up members which have nothing to do with any pawl control.The activity of the hold up members causes the objects to fall further to the left than in czse these members ere absent. This means that the same effect is obtained as with a longitudinal shift of the discharge control abutments. In this respect it is remarked that at low velocities any shift to the right in fig. 6 would be small in comparison to this shift at high velocities, which means that at low velocities such a shift would cause the objects to fall further to the left, a result obtained with the hold up mechanism.At a certain travelling velocity the holders move so fast that either their roll does not reach the left surface of the pawl control or the hold up members or that they move below them. At this velocity consequently no further dis placement is obtained of the location where an object comes down. In practice with existing holders in this way a con pensation of the travelling velocity is obtained for low and moderate velocities.At high speeds a further compensation can be obtained by letting the sleeve 4 move toward the right. In fig. 6 the position is shown in which such a displacement toward the right is completed. This is done by a non shown actuator for the longitudinal displacement of the beam 1 , s analogous to the actuators 29 and 29 shown in fig. 3 and 4. A difference with the embodiment of fig. 1 3 is, however, that the longitudinal displacement of the bean 1 only wily begin at a predetermined velocity of the holders correspoding to the velocity at which the hold up members become ineffective, which in the following will be called the transitory velocity.The control for the unshown actuator of the beam 1 is adapted to start its activity only at travelling velocities higher than the transitory velocity. This can be attained in several ways, which can be considered to be within the reach of the expert. A first one is to measure the travelling velocity and to let said bean actuator only shift the beam in case of velocities higher than said transitory velocity.The latter result can be obtained by any computer or comparator device, analogous or digital, deriving a signal which is a function of the value of said measured velocity above said transitory velocity. Another means could consist in a delay means giving no output signal in the time period the device normally takes to start up from zero to the said transitory velocity and to give from that time on an output signal which will cause said beam 1 to take the position corresponding to the optimum position at the velocity the device will have at that moment with a normal start up.In fig. 6 the beam 1 and the sleeve 4 , the pawls 641 647 and the pawl control members 671 677 are at rest in a position leftward from what has been shown in fig. 6 and in fact so far to the left, that the right hand end portion of detectable element 84 is located in the same longitudinal position as is pick up alfflmEnt 85. When in this position of beam 1 sleeve 4 is ro t a t e d sfep by step because of activating successive pawls 641 646 detectable element 84 is rotated toward pick up element 85 but not yet sufficiently to activate it, When, however, pawl 647 has become active the sleeve 4 is rotated so far that pick up element 85 is activated. This element controls in first instance a sleeve reset magnet 86 to move rod 82 downward in order to restore the starting position of sleeve 4 .Another effect of the activation of pick up member 85 is the generation of the starting signal for the receiving pockets 32 in order to command one or two of their members 34 to rotate about the related shaft or shafts 33 in order to lower the row of eggs contained in the juxtapositioned pockets.At low velocities of the device sufficient time is available to control the sleeve reset and the receiving pockets. At high velocity it is, however, important to have these activities starting as early as possible, because it is necessary to have the sleeve 4 again in the right position when a new holder arrives at pawl control member 671 and to have removed the row of previous dropped objects in time to prevent disturbancies. These disturbancies may consist in having the next object, when still in the holder or the holder itself hit an object in a receiving pocket, in case the dropping height is rather small or that the first pocket to be filled with the first object of the next row is still not emptied. At high velocities, however, already after activation of pawl control member 676 by the sixth holder t cr be discharged a signal becomes available for resetting the sleeve and removing the dropped row of objects. Because always some time lapses before these activities are finished no danger exists that they happen too early.At low velocities it would, however, be possible to have these activities to occur too soon, because then the time for travelling from the location where the pawl control member 676 is activated toward the discharge control abutment 716 may be so long, that the related receiving pocket is already quite opened or even the sleeve 4 is rotated back, so that discharge control abutment 716 is already out of the trajectory of the discharge abutment of the holder when the latter reaches the location of said discharge control abutment.At high velocities all these things are impossible, because a device always needs some time to slow down, which means that in that instance no danger is involved in generating the control signal of pick up element 85 earlier. And it is exactly with high velocities, that such an early generation is desirable or even necessaryIn fig. 9 and 10 the situation is elucidated in which roll 24 does cooperate with a pawl control or hold up member 67. In fig. 9 in uninterrupted lines the position is shown in which discharge member 6 with its part 8 engages a discharge control abutment 71. It is visible that roll 24 is near to the left surface of the related hold up member 71 and will pivot clockwise as soon as the cooperation with the discharge control abutment 67 is terminated.In case the related holdup or pawl control member 71 has not yet sufficiently fallen back, roll 24 will pass below it as suggested in interrupted lines in fig. 9.If, however, 67 has sufficiently fallen back, its left surface will hold up roll 24, as shown in fig. 10. In the position shown in that figure in solid lines the object is not yet free to leave the holder, but when the position indicated with intErrupted lines is reached the object is free to fall.This object has been indicated with 100 in fig. 6, 9 and 10, the final position taken in the receiving pockets 32 being shown in interrupted lines and indicated at 101.In the system shown in fig. 11 a start switch 102 is connected at the one hand to a delay device 103 which after a predetermined delay opens switch 104 and at the other hand to a frequency regulator 105 controlling the rotational speed of the drive motor 106 for the device.A potentiometer 107 controls the final frequency of the motor 106. This potentiometer is mechanically ganged to another potentiometer 109.A comparator receives two potentials, the one from the potentiometer 109 and the other from a potentiometer 108 mechanically ganged to the beam 1,1 or 1 of the shown embodiments. The output of the comparator is fed to two pulse width modulators 111 and 112, things being such arranged that 111 passes a signal in case the output of 110 is positive and 112 passes a signal in case the output of 110 is negative. Reference 113 indicates a transistor control for energizing an adjustment motor 114 in dependence on the sign and value of the output voltage of 110. This motor 114 actuates the beam 1,1 or 1 bearing the discharge control members as well as the potentiometer 108, which ene zes the negative input of 110.The delay time of the delay device 103 is adjusted to the time period in which tlie hold up members are active. This time period corresponds to the time the device normally needs to reach the transitory velocity. After this time period switch 104 is opened by reason of which the output voltage of potentiometer 109 is fed to comparator 110 and adjustment motor 114 is driven in the direction and with the velocity which correspond to the position of potentiometers 108 and 109, that is to say the actual position of the beam 1, 1 or 1 beyond the optimum position it has to take at the transitory velocity on the one hand and the commanded rotational speed of the motor 106 on the other hand.When stopping the device switch 102 is opened interrupting the fed for frequency regulator 105 and causing switch 104 to close. This connects one input of it to earth and causes beam 1,1 or 1 to be reset in the zero position.It will be clear that it is also possible to use a delay circuit giving an output signal which is such a function of time that it causes the beam 1,1 or 1 to take the right position during starting and stopping the device. In the above examples the discharge control members are abutments to be hit by the discharge members of the holders.It is, however, also possible that the discharge control members differ therefrom, an example being magnetically activable discharge mechanisms carried by the holders. A further possibility is, that the discharge control members are adapted to carry out a movement transverse to the travelling direction of the holders to cause them to discharge. For the invention it is only essential, that the discharge control members are shifted in the travelling direction of the holders. In case in a single device a plurality of beams or other supports for discharge control members are present, it is possible to have only one single device for generating a control signal for several beam actuators.Finally it is remarked, that in case the longitudinal dis placement of the beam is used for other control functions as is the case in the third shown embodiment, such an use is not restricted to the application of an electrovBgnetic detection system. In stead other systems may be used, such as the cooperation between a magnet and Reed contacts orHall generators, an optical system using photosensitive devices and interruption of light pathes or deviation of them with mirrors, air jets and other means known per se, which can be substituted for 84 and 85.
