# Pressure relieving bandage.

## Abstract
By a pressure relieving bandage there is arranged a flexible, non adhesive, waterproof film 2 between a foam layer 1 and a pressure sensitive adhesive layer 3 contain ing a hydrocolloid. This will ensure that the expansion of the adhesive by moisture absorption will preferably take place in a direction away from the film 2 and in towards the body. The bandage will therefore not so easily let go of its adhesion to the skin since there is no horizontal displacement of any importance. Moreover, the foam layer is provided with cuts 5 so that large or small sections 6 can be removed from the bandage. The plaster can therefore be used as a pressure relieving bandage. For prophylactic use it is advantageous to insert a mi cro porous tape 7 between the foam layer 1 and the film 2 and to leave out the adhesive layer 3 . Instead the underside of the tape 7 and the film 2 is adhesive and protected by a removable protective cover 4 .
