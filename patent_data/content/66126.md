# Real time digital scan converter.

## Abstract
A digital scan converter is disclosed wherein signal information supplied by a sector scanning surveillance system relative to a polar coordinate system is converted to a signal for driving a television type display or other Cartesian coordinate device by a sampling the signal associated with each consecutive scanning path of the surveillance system at a rate determined by the azimuthal angle that defines the scanning path of interest b storing each set of signal samples as a column of data in a rectangular memory array c accessing the stored data on a row by row basis and d utilizing a previously determined mapping strategy to cause each accessed signal sample to form a segment of a line of display within the Cartesian formulated display devices so that the length of the segment formed by each signal sample is determined by the row and column address of the storage location that is associated therewith when forming a televi sion compatible signal, each signal sample dictates video signal level during a portion of a corresponding horizontal sweep period that is determined by the mapping strategy.
