# Synthetic copolymer surgical articles and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A triblock copolymer having a proportion of units having the formula O CH₂ O CH₂ I as the end blocks, and the formula I randomly combined with a proportion of units having the formula O CH₂ ₃ O II as the middle block finds particular advantageous use in manufacturing absorbable monofilament sutures and other surgical articles. A surgical article is manufactured from a synthetic absorbable copolymer formed by copolymerizing glycolide with 1,3 dioxan 2 one trimethylene carbonate wherein a combination of the monomers is substantially completely polymerized before the addition of the other monomer in the presence of a difunctional initiator at or below about 180 C glycolide is added and the temperature increased up to about the melting point of poly glycolide to form a triblock copolymer with a proportion of units having the formula O CH₂ O CH₂ I as the end blocks, and the formula I randomly combined with a proportion of units having the formula O CH₂ ₃ O II as the middle block.
