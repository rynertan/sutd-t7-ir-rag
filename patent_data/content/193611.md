# PERMANENT MAGNET FIELD SYSTEM SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet field system synchronous motor has a rotor 22 which is provided with a cylindrical outer surface. A field system is established by a plurality of per manent magnets 25 that are mounted on the outer surface of the rotor and that are arranged in the peripheral direction. Each permanent magnet has a partially cylindrical outer surface 25b which is in parallel with the cylindrical outer surface of the rotor, and has a uniform thickness as a whole. When seen in an developed view, the inner and outer sur faces of each permanent magnet have a contour equipped with a plurality of groups of straight lines close to sinusoidal half wave curves S₁, S₂ that stretch across both ends of the permanent magnet in the circumferential direction.
