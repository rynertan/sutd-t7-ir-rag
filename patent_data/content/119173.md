# Rigid inflatable means for artificially erecting the penis in the case of impotence.

## Abstract
The rigid inflatable means for artificially erecting the penis in incurable cases of impotence comprise a tank pump 6 that allows the filling with liquid of the cavities made in the two parts 3 of two cylinders 1 and 2 implanted in the corpora cavernosa 12. The said liquid passes from the tank pump 6 into the said parts 3 of the cylinders 1 and 2 causing them to become rigid and thus giving the penis adequate consistence for vaginal penetration.

## Description
Rigid inflatable means for artificially erecting the penis in the case of impotenceThe invention relates to means for artificially erecting the penis in incurable cases of impotence that comprise a tank pump and two cylinders implanted in the corpora cavernosa.The erection process of the penis is characterized by blood passing from the pudendal artery branch of the hypo gastric artery into the inside of the cavernosa tissue, the said phenomenon being performed with the mediation of the autonomous nervous system.An alteration in the nerves or an obstruction in the vessels entrusted with the movement of the blood brings about the condition whereby erection is impossible, defined clinically as impotence.An erection is characterized by the volume of the penis becoming greater and by an increase in the consistence thereof, both necessary for adequate vaginal penetration.Artificial means of the rigid, semi rigid or pliable, and of the inflatable type are currently in existence for the treatment of impotence, the said means always being constituted by two cylindrical elements surgically inserted inside the corpora cavernosa.In particular, inflatable means require a tank for liquid that has to be implanted underneath the abdominal wall muscles, and mechanism for displacing the liquid from the tank to the cylinders and vice versa. This mechanism, that can be assimilated to a pump, is inserted in the scrotum and the operation the of generally requires multiple action and is, therefore somewhat difficult. The means forming the subject of the invention can be defined rigid inflatable means in which both chambers of the cylinders are connected to a pump that also serves as the tank, through the interposition of a valve that can be housed in the scrotum.In this way, the use is dispensed with of a tank for liquid as is required in the knows art and the artificial means are confined purely to the corpora cavernosa and to the scrotum without surgery in the abdominal region being required.The characteristics of the means forming the subject of the invention will now be outlined more fully in the description that follows of one preferred embodiment that is illustrated on the accompanying drawings and in which Figure 1 shows the means in question in a plan view with the various component parts assembled one to the other figure 2 shows, in a longitudinal section, one of the cylinders of the means seen in a larger scale than in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows, diagrammatically, the means in question surgically inserted in the corpora cavernosa and in the scrotum Figure 4 shows, diagrammatically in a longitudinal sect ion in the same scale as in Figure 2, one possible em bodiment for the cylinders that is modified compared with that illustrated in Figure 2. The cylinders 1 and 2 that have to be implanted in the corpora cavernosa, are constituted by a semi rigid part 7 positioned, during the implantation process, underneath the glans, and by a semi rigid part 8 from which extends a tube 9 for the filling liquid. A middle part 3 in between the parts 7 and 8 is constituted by a hollow, flexl ible, chamber that can be filled with liquid.The tubes 9 belonging to the cylinders 1 and 2 are joined, through a connector 4, to a valve or valvular system 5 contained in a non rigia bulb 5a directly connected to a tank pump 6.All the components are made out of biocompatible, elastic, material silastene, polyurethane or similar that ensures elasticity and flexibility for the chamber 3 when this is empty and sufficient rigidity for the rigid parts 7 and 8 that can be constituted by cylinders of the same type of material though not necessarily of the same composition .The liquid utilized for the operation of the artificial erection means has to be biocompatible use is normally made of a physiological solution but silicone oil or similar can also be employed.The valve 5 normally allows the liquid to pass only in the direction that goes from the tank pump 6 to the chambers 3 however, the said valve has been designed in such a way that lateral pressure on the bulb 5a inside which the valve is contained, renders it pervious in both directions so that the liquid can return from the chambers 3 to the tank pump 6.A description will now be given of the operation of the means forming the subject of the invention. ashen non operative at the time of flaccidity, the liquid that fills what can be defined as the hydraulic system comprising the tank pump 6, the valve 5, the connector 4, the tubes 9 and the chambers 3, is almost completely contained in the tank 6, while the two chambers 3 are almost empty, leaving maximum positioning freedom for the parts 7 and 8. Mhen the patient wishes to obtain an erection, the tank pump 6 has to be compressed through one single manual action via the scrotum. This forces the valve 5 to open and the liquid to flow into the chambers 3, causing them to become rigid and to swell. The penis is, in this way, made to displace vertically with respect to the abdominal wall similarly to the deviation that occurs with a physiol ideal erection.Thus the penis acquires adequate axial rigidity and consistence to permit normal vaginal penetration.To bring about detumescence, the patient has to perform one single operation of decompression on the lateral part of the bulb in which the valvular element 5 is contained, and in this way the liquid flows back into the tank pump 6 rendering the chambers 3 flexible once again and allowing the penis to adopt the optimum flaccidity position.An example of how the artificial means are implanted is shown in Figure 3. The method used can be supra pubic or infrapubic and it involves placing the cylinders 1 and 2 in position inside the corpora cavernosa 12, and the tank pump 6 with the valve 5 inside the pouch enclosing the testes, obviously with these being retained.In cases when the length of the cylinders is not sufficient, the use is envisaged of extension pieces again made of biocompatible elastic material that are shown at 10 in the example illustrated in Figure 2, and are inserted on to the tapered extremity of the part 8. The said ex tension pieces shall be provided in various lengths, to be utilized according to the requirements, keeping to one single basic structure for the cylinders.The capacity of the tank pump 6 has been so calculated that when it is compressed, the liquid displaced be sufficient to fill completely the chambers 3 at a pressure that is not dangerous, and at any rate no greater than with 100 130 centimetres of H20. Advantageously, the part 7 can be made in one piece with the connector 4 and be provided with a sealing cap 7a to be inserted stably on to the said part 7 until it arrives flush with the end border of this.The part 7 can, in this way, be dimensioned lengthwise at a maximum value and, therefore, be shortened by the surgeon during the implantation operation to suit the said part 7 to the characteristics of the penis of the patient.According to one possible constructional variant seeFigure 4 , the part 3 of the cylinders 1 and 2 is provided with an internal hollow, variable section, chamber, commencing at the engagement area with the part 8. In this way the part 3 can, in the flaccidity condition of the penis, very easily bend back with respect to the part 7 and thereby favour the natural position of the penis in the said condition.
