# Process for the preparation of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of hydrocarbons by catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen where in the feed is contacted at elevated temperature and pressure with a catalyst comprising 3 60 pbw cobalt, 0.1 100 pbw zirconium, titanium, chromium and or ruthenium per 100 pbw of carrier, which catalyst is in the form of a fixed bed and has an external surface area S
