# Use of diphenylethane derivative as solvent for colour former in pressure sensitive recording materials solutions, microcapsules, sheets coated with microcapsules and pressure sensitive recording materials containing said solvent method of copying using said sheets or recording materials.

## Abstract
Known pressure sensitive recording materials cannot be used satisfactorily in severe environmental conditions, for example in hot and humid climates or in very cold climates. It has now been found that if 1 isopropylphenyl 2 phenylethane is employed as a solvent for a colour former which is encapsulated in microcapsules which are coated onto a face of a sheet to form a pressure sensitive recording material, excellent results can be obtained even in severe environmental conditions.
