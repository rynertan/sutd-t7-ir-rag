## Abstract
To eliminate the technical problems with the prior art de scribed above, and accomplish the object described above, the gist of the present invention resides in that the compo nents of the electrode reaction member are divided into two different and independent compositions, whereby one of the components is a porous supported material of a platinum com ponent which is bonded onto the surface of a corrosionresis tant, electrically conductive substrate, and the other compo nent is a support consisting of at least one of ruthenium oxide, palladium oxide and iridium oxide, distributed three dimen sionally in and over the surface of the above component, and being thus supported and bonded thereto. The supported ma terial component and the support component can exhibit a suf ficient electrode function even in an electrode in which they are used individually as electrode reaction members.

## Description
SPECIFICATIONTITLE OF THE INVENTION ELECTROLYSIS ELECTRODE AND PRODUCTION METHOD THEREOFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The technique disclosed in this specification broadly belongs to the field of the technique of producing an electrolysis anode having a low overvoltage and high durability. The invention of this application relates to an electrolysis electrode of the type in which an electrode reaction member is integrally deposited over part or over the entire surface of a corrosion resistant, electrically conductive substrate, and also to a production method of such an electrolysis electrode. More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrolysis electrode in which a porous supported material of platinum or the like is integrally formed over the surface of the substrate by electroplating or the like, and a support such as ruthenium oxide, is formed and supported integrally and three dimensionally by the supported material by thermal decomposition or the like.The present invention also relates to a method of producing such an electrolysis electrode. 2 Description of the Prior Art The electrolysis electrodes that have been widely used in the past have a construction in which an electrode reaction member is coated and bonded onto the surface of a corrosion resistant, electrically conductive surface. The fundamental requirements for electrodes of this kind are twofold the electrode reaction member must have a high mechanical bonding strength to the substrate, a high chemical corrosion resistance and electric conductivity together with the substrate while the electrode reaction member by itself must have a high mechanical bonding strength between the components that constitute the member, a high chemical corrosion resistance, a predetermined electric conductivity and low overvoltage during the electrode reaction. Conventional electrolysis electrodes have an electrode reaction member having a composition containing a component from the group of platinum metals which is bonded to the surface of a corrosion resistant, electrically conductive substrate. In the electrolysis electrodes of the kind described above, the electrode reaction member can be divided into two groups one being composed of a metal from the platinum group, and the other being composed of an oxide of a metal from the platinum group Electrodes of the former group, that is, electrodes coated with a metal from the platinum group, have been known for a long time. In particular, a large number of proposals have been made for electrodes coated with platinum, and electrodes having a high bonding strength of the electrode reaction member itself, Ã…a high bonding strength with respect to the substrate, an excellent corrosion resistance, and a high durability have been heretofore developed. Although this type of electrode coated with platinum has a large number of excellent characteristics, these electrodes are not yet entirely satisfactory in conjunction with their applications. The principal problems of these electrodes are as follows.In comparison with various other electrodes that have been put to practical application, the overvoltage characteristics of electrodes coated with platinum with respect to chlorine and oxygen remains low at the initial stages of the electrolysis in the same way as with electrodes of other types, but as time passes, the overvoltage characteristics become higher and eventually they induce an increase of the power consumption for the electrolysis and hence, an increase in the production cost. Moreover, undesired electrolytic reactions other than the intended reaction takes place with an increase in the overvoltage, and this is likely to inhibit the intended electrolysis. Accordingly, various attempts have been made in the past to eliminate the problem of the increase in the overvoltage of electrode reaction members using platinum with the passage of time. Such attempts include, for example, a method of adding various metals to the platinum by various means to form a platinum alloy, and thus prevent the increase of the overvoltage, or a method which reactivates a platinum electrode whose overvoltage has increased by cathodic electrolysis. However, electrodes produced by these methods are not free from the problems because the production is difficult in practice due to the complicated process, and the electrodes have a low corrosion resistance, or the duration of the reactivation effect is short. On the other hand, electrodes which are coated with an oxide of a metal from the platinum group such as ruthenium oxide, rhodium oxide, palladium oxide, or iridium oxide as a component of the electrode reaction member have a low overvoltage, long life and stable catalytic function.Moreover, since the typical production method of electrodes coated with an oxide of a metal from the platinum group is a thermal decomposition method in which a solution containing a compound that forms the oxide of the metal from the platinum group is coated over the surface of the substrate, and then this coating is thermally decomposed, a member covered with an oxide of the platinum group can be obtained easily even if it comprises a combination of a large number of components. However, the bonding strength between the electrode reaction member and the substrate, and the bonding strength of the electrode reaction member itself, are not sufficient if the electrode reaction member consists only of an oxide or oxides from the platinum group, and peeling of the electrode reaction member is likely to occur during electrolysis. In addition, the electrode life is extremely short. For these reasons, electrodes of this kind are not sufficiently practical, either. In order to extend the life of an electrode coated with an oxide of a metal from the platinum group and increase the bonding strength of the electrode reaction member, therefore, attempts have been made to add a second component such as a corrosion resistant oxide like titanium oxide, or a metal from the platinum group to the oxide of the metal from the platinum group to form a mixture, alloy or mixed crystal.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to the elimination of the problems with convention electrolysis electrodes which have a component from the platinum group acting as the electrode reaction member deposited on the substrate described above. To make full use of the advantage of platinum and oxides of metals from the platinum group as components of the electrode reaction member, the present invention has a porous supported material which supports a support threedimensionally in a novel arrangement which is completely different from the construction of a conventional electrode reaction member of a multi component system.Thus, the present invention is directed to provide an electrolysis electrode, and a method of producing the same, which electrode has a low overvoltage and a long service life, and which can be advantageously used in various electrolysis applications in the field of the electrochemical industry. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is graph showing the results of the measurement of the electrode potential of electrolysis electrodes. Figure 2 is graph showing the results of the measurement of the electrode potential of electrolysis electrodes. Figure 3 is graph showing the results of the measurement of the electrode potential of electrolysis electrodes.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Since the supported material is porous, the construction of the supported material and the support includes also such a construction in which part of the support is bonded to the substrate. The electrode in accordance with the present invention can be applied to a large number of electrolytic processes by varying the choice of support component. A suitable choice of supported material component and support component of the electrode of the present invention determines whether or not the present electrode can be used under electrolytic conditions in which even an electrode coated only with platinum as the supported material component exhibits sufficient durability of the electrode, whereas an electrode coated only with an oxide from the platinum group as the support component exhibits a low overvoltage, and the mode of consumption of the electrode virtually results from the peeling of the coating. Since the durability of electrodes coated with platinum in a large number of electrolytic processes has been publicly recognized, the choice of the application of the electrode in accordance with the present invention is mostly determined by the support component which is one of the constituents of the electrode reaction member. For electrolysis in an electrolytic solution which is acidic by sulfuric acid, for the electrolysis of brine used for production of sodium hypochlorite and for electrolysis in a solution having a low concentration of chlorine ions, for example, the preferred support component is iridium oxide. For the electrolysis of common salt containing a high concentration of chlorine ions, the preferred support component is ruthenium oxide, IDalladiunl oxide or a combination of them. In an electrode having an electrode reaction member whose supported material is platinum and whose support consists of at least one of ruthenium oxide, palladium oxide and iridium oxide, the mode of deterioration of the electrode at the end of its life can be broadly classified into the following two groups, which have been experimentally confirmed, because the composition of the electrode reaction member is divided into independent constituents, i.e., the supported material component and the support component, unlike conventional multi component electrolysis electrodes relying upon alloys, mixtures or mixed crystals, and because the support component is three dimensionally supported by the supported material component. One of the modes of deterioration of electrodes is such that the end of the life is reached at a high overvoltage in the same way as in the expiration of a platinum electrode during electrolysis while some of the electrode reaction member component remains, while the other is such that almost all of the electrode reaction member is consumed. When producing an electrode having an improved life, therefore, a suitable method can be selected while taking the modes of deterioration into consideration. In an electrode which has expired due to a high overvoltage while sufficient electrode reaction member component remains, it is believed that the support appearing on the surface of the electrode reaction surface is consumed more rapidly than the supported material, and hence the overvoltage becomes high and the life of the electrode is over. Accordingly, the life of the electrode in such a case can not be extended by increasing the total quantity of the electrode reaction member component. For the reason noted above, the life of the electrolytic electrode in accordance with the present invention can be extended by increasing only the quantity of the support component of the components of the electrode reaction member. In an electrode whose electrode reaction member is consumed, on the other hand, the life of the electrode can be extended by increasing the amount of electrode reaction member in the same way as in the conventional method, but in most cases, the life can be extended effectively by increasing only the quantity of platinum component used as the supported material without increasing the total quantity of the electrode reaction member. It is believed that the effect described above is provided when the speed of consumption of the supported material is higher than that of the support. The method of producing the electrode of the present invention will now be described. The gist of the present method resides in that the formation process of the electrode reaction member is divided broadly into the process of the formation of the supported material, and that of the support. In other words, after the porous supported material is first formed and bonded to the surface of a corrosion resistant, electrically conductive substrate, the support is three dimensionally supported by the supported material and then another layer of porous supported material is formed and bonded to the surface of the electrode reaction member, where necessary, the support is further supported three dimensionally by the supported material and these procedures are repeated at least once in order to increase the thickness of the reaction member layer.For example, in an electrode whose electrode reaction member consists of the porous platinum component as the supported material and the support is of at least one of ruthenium oxide, palladium oxide and iridium oxide, the porous platinum is formed and bonded by electroplating to the surface of the corrosionresistant, electrically conductive substrate or to the surface of the electrode reaction member, and a solution containing at least one of ruthenium oxide, palladium oxide and iridium oxide is then sufficiently permeated into the platinum component as a whole by thermal decomposition and is thermally decomposed in an oxidizing atmosphere so that an oxide from the platinum group is three dimensionally supported by the platinum, and the electrolysis electrode of the invention can thus be obtained. Two methods may be employed, in principle, in order to form.the porous platinum one being a method in which the porous platinum is formed directly onto the surface of the substrate, and the other being a method in which a coating layer of the platinum is first formed, and then the coating layer is subjected to a treatment which renders it porous. However, the second method sometimes fails to accomplish the condition in which the solution of the compound has permeated sufficiently into the platinum and the oxide from the platinum group is three dimensionally supported, even if the method can cover the surface of the platinum metal completely. In order to form the porous platinum in the electrolytic electrode of the present invention, therefore, it is preferable to employ the first method in which the porous platinum is formed directly. This kind of method includes electroplating, flame spraying, thermal decomposition, and the like.Among them, electroplating is excellent with respect to the performance of the resultant electrode and economy. Among the electroplating processes in general, the most preferred method is a method in which the platinum is electrodeposited in the form of a porous spherical aggregate. To obtain platinum having a higher porosity, it is effective to form the porous platinum directly and then increase the porosity by a chemical or electrochemical process. The properties required for the platinum metal as the supported material during the production are such that the metal has a porosity sufficient to allow the solution containing the compound from the platinum group to permeate thereinto, and has such a state of bonding between the substrate and the platinum in which the bond will not deteriorate due to oxidizing gases and volatile components of the compound during the heating process of the thermal decomposition. In order for the porous platinum to have a sufficient permeability of the solution containing the compound, the apparent density of the platinum is preferably below 3 19 g cm . If the porosity is so high that the apparent 3 density drops below 8 g cm , however, the mechanical strength would drop and hence, the service life of the electrode would be reduced. In order to allow the smooth permeation of the compound and its solution that are to be thermally decomposed when three dimensionally forming the oxide from the platinum group on the porous platinum, it is preferable that the viscosity of the solution is low and the concentration of the compound is not too high. In order to improve the permeation of the compound, it is also effective to apply ultrasonic waves to the substrate. Examples of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying graphs.Example 1 A sheet of titanium was degreased using a trichlene degreasing solution and was subjected to a surface treatment using an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution and concentrated h drochloric acid to provide a substrate. Porous platinum used as the supported material having an apparent density of approximately 16 g cm3 and an electrodeposition quantity of 4.5 mg cm2 was deposited onto the surface of the treated titanium substrate by electroplating using a platinum plating bath prepared by dissolving dinitrodiaminoplatinum in an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Next, a permeation solution was prepared by dissolving 1.07 g of iridium chloride in 10 mQ of butanol. The permeation solution was taken up by a micropippet so that the quantity of iridium oxide which would become the support was 0.14 mg cm2, calculated the weight of the iridium, this was then permeated into the platinum. After the support was vacuum dried at room temperature for one hour, it was heated at 5000C for 20 minutes in the atmosphere to provide an electrolysis electrode. For comparison, electrode No. 1 1 was produced by 2 forming 4.5 mg cm of platinum on a titanium substrate in the same way as that of the electrode of this example. An iridium chloride solution having a concentration three times that of the permeation solution used for the production of the electrode of the present invention was coated on each of a titanium substrate pre treated in the same way as the above, and on a rolled bulk platinum sheet decreased by the trichlene decreasing solution, so that the 2 quantity of iridium was 0.14 mg cm , calculated by the weight of the iridium, in the same quantity as that of the present electrode and in the same way as that of the electrode of the present invention.The coated substrate and platinum sheet were then dried and heated in the same way as in the electrode of the present invention so as to produce electrodeNo. 1 2 in which the iridium oxide was coated on the titanium surface, and an electrode No. 1 3 in which the iridium oxide was coated on the surface of the bulk platinum sheet. These electrodes were used for electrolysis in an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid of 1 M with a liquid temperature of 55 C and a current density of 400 A dm2.The potential of each electrode at a current density of 1 A dm2 was measured at predetermined periods. The results are shown in the graph of Figure 1, in which time hr is plotted on the abscissa, and the electrode potential V with respect to silver chloride on the ordinate. The curves C1, C2, C3 and C4 correspond to the electrodes Nos 1 1, 1 2, 1 3 and the electrode of this example, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the electrode of this example of the present invention which comprises the combination of platinum as the supported material and iridium oxide as the support maintains a lower electrode potential lower overvoltage and has a much longer electrode life than electrode No. 1 1. It can also be seen that the electrode of this example maintains its low electrode potential in the same way as electrodes No. 1 2 and No. 1 3. Furthermore, it can be seen that the electrode of the present invention keeps its low electrode potential under electrolytic conditions until the electrode reaction member is almost completely consumed.Example 2 A sheet of titanium for a substrate was decreased and then surface treated using an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution and an aqueous sulfuric acid solution. Thereafter, platinum as the supported material having an average apparent density of 16 g cm3 and an electrodeposition quantity of 1.1 mg cm2 was formed over the surface of the titanium sheet in the same way as in Example 1. Next, 0.01 mg cm2 of ruthenium oxide, calculated by the weight of the ruthenium, was supported threedimensionally on the platinum formei in the manner described above, using a permeation solution prepared by dissolving 0.258 g of ruthenium chloride in 10 mZ of butanol in the same way as in Example 1. However, the heating temperature during the thermal decomposition was 4300C. 2 After 0.5 mg cm of platinum was electrodeposited on the surface of the electrode reaction member prepared in the manner described above, 0.01 mg cm2 of ruthenium oxide, calculated by the weight of the ruthenium, was supported in the same way as above to provide an electrode. For comparison, electrode No. 2 1 was produced by forming platinum over a titanium sheet in the same way as above. Electrode No. 2 2 was produced by coating the same permeation solution as used above over the surface of a pre treated titanium sheet, and electrode No. 2 3 was likewise produced by coating the permeation solution over the surface of a bulk platinum sheet. In these electrodesNos. 2 2 and 2 3, the same quantity of ruthenium oxide was deposited on each substrate as in the electrode of this example. These electrodes were used for electrolysis in an aqueous sodium chloride solution of 200 g Q with a liquid temperature of 45 C and a current density of 100 A dm and the electrode potential at a current density of 10 A dm2 was measured at predetermined periods. The results are shown in the graph of Figure 2 in the same way as in Figure 1. The electrodes Nos. 2 1, 2 2, 2 3 and the electrode of this example are represented by the symbols C1 , C21, C3 and C4 , respectively. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the electrode of the present invention, which comprises a combination of platinum as the supported material and ruthenium oxide as the support, maintains a lower electrode potential for a longer period of time, and has a higher durability than the other electrodes.Example 3 After a sheet of titanium substrate was surface treated in the same way as in Example 2, porous platinum was formed over the titanium sheet by electroplating using a platinum bath prepared by dissolving dinitrodiaminoplatinum in an aqueous alkali solution. The platinum thus formed was then treated with an aqueous solution of a mixed acid consisting of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, so as to deposit the platinum used as the supported material having an apparent density of approximately 14 g cm3 and an electrodeposition quantity of 2.3 mg cm2. Next, 0.10 mg cm2 of palladium oxide, calculated by the weight of the palladium, was supported threedimensionally using a permeation solution prepared by dissolving 0.832 g of palladium chloride in 10 mQ of an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, in the same way as inExample 1, to provide the electrode of this example The heating temperature in this case was 6000C. For comparison, electrode No. 3 1 was produced by forming platinum over a titanium sheet in the same way as in this example. Using a coating solution having a concentration twice that of the permeation solution of this example, 1.0 mg cm2 of palladium oxide, calculated by the weight of the palladium, was deposited over a titanium sheet under the same heating conditions as above to provide electrode No. 3 2, while the same quantity of palladium oxide was coated over a bulk platinum sheet under the same heating conditions as above to provide electrode No. 3 3. These electrodes were then subjected to an electrolytic test in the same way as in Example 2. The results are shown in Figure 3 in the same way as in Figures 1 and 2. Electrodes Nos. 3 1, 3 2, 3 3 and the electrode of this example are represented by C111, C21,, C3 , and C4 , respectively. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the electrode of this example, which comprises a combination of platinum as the supported material and palladium oxide as the support, maintains a lower electrode potential for a longer period of time, and has a higher durability than the other electrodes.Example 4 Platinum used as the supported material having an apparent density of 16 g cm3 and an electrodeposition quantity of 1.7 mg cm2 was formed over a titanium sheet as the substrate in the same way as in Example 1. Three electrodes Nos. 1, 2, 3 were then produced by using a permeation solution prepared by suitably diluting the permeation solution of Example 1 by butanol and by changing the quantity of iridium oxide used in the support. These electrodes were used for electrolysis in an aqueous sulfuric acid solution of 1 M with a liquid temperature of 55 C and a current density of 10 A dm2. The electrode life until the electrode potential with respect to silver chloride reached 1.7 V was measured, with the results as shown in the following Table 1. Table 1Sample Components of electrode Electrode life RemarksNo. reaction memberSupported material Support 1 1.7 mg cm2 0.01 mg cm2 1.5 hr.Most of the electrode reaction member 2 1.7 0.02 10 component remained at the end of the electrode life.3 1.7 0.04 at least 50 calculated by the weight of the iridium It can be seen from Table 1 that the life of the electrode of this invention can be extended effectively by increasing the quantity of the support under these electrolytic conditions.Example 5 Three electrolysis electrodes were produced in the same way as in Example 1, but the quantity of platinum used the supported material deposited on the titanium sheet as the substrate was varied. These electrodes Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 were subjected to an electrolytic test in the same way as in Example 1, and the life of the electrodes until the electrode potential with respect to silver chloride reached 1.7 V was measured with the results as shown in the following Table 2.

These electrodes were used for electrolysis in a 3 aqueous solution of sodium chloride with a liquid temperature of 20 C and a current density of 10 A dm2, and the effective chlorine generation efficiency was measured. The results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that the electrode III of this example which comprises the combination of platinum as the supported material, and iridium oxide as the support, exhibits a higher effective chlorine generation efficiency than the electrodes I and II.

The effective chlorinegeneration efficiency was measured for electrodes IV, V andVI whose supports was composed of combinations of the oxides of iridium, ruthenium and palladium, in the same measuring conditions as in Example 6. The results of the experiments are as follows. An electrode of the present invention whose support was composed of a composite component prepared by adding up to 50 mol of palladium oxide and or iridium oxide to ruthenium oxide exhibited an electrode potential lower than, or equal to, the electrode potential of an electrode of the present invention whose support was composed of ruthenium oxide alone, in an aqueous sodium chloride solution. The electrode potential of an electrode of the present invention whose support was composed of a composite component prepared by adding up to 50 molE of ruthenium oxide and or iridium oxide to palladium oxide was extremely low in the same way as that of an electrode of the present invention whowe support was composed of palladium oxide alone, in an aqueous sodium chloride solution.Further, the electrode potential of an electrode of the present invention whose support was composed of a composite component prepared by adding up to 50 mol of ruthenium oxide and or palladium oxide to iridium oxide was lower than that of an electrode of the present invention whose support was composed of iridium oxide alone, in an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. The results of the measurement of the effective chlorine generation efficiency are also shown in Table 3.It can be seen from Table 3 that the effective chlorinegeneration efficiency can be improved by adding ruthenium oxide and or palladium oxide to iridium oxide when preparing the support. It can be seen from Table 2 that the life of the electrode of the present invention can be extended effectively by increasing the quantity of the platinum used as the supported material under these electrolytic conditions. As described above, in an electrolysis electrode of the type in which an electrode reaction member is coated over the surface of a corrosion resistant, electrically conductive substrate, the present invention supports the support three dimensionally by a porous supported material used as the skeletal structure of the electrode reaction member components, so that the invention can provide an electrode which has a fundamentally higher mechanical bonding strength with respect to the substrate, prevents the peeling of the electrode reaction member, and has a high chemical corrosion resistance. In particular, because at least one compound selected from ruthenium oxide, palladium oxide and iridium oxide is permeated into the platinum and is three dimensionally supported by thermal decomposition, peeling can be effectively prevented. The present invention provides another advantage in that the mechanical bonding strength is high between the electrode reaction components, the chemical resistance is high, and these properties are always linked to each other. Irrespective of the fact that the supported material is platinum, the increase of the overvoltage which takes place in a platinum electrode with the passage of time during electrolysis can be almost completely prevented until the electrode reaction member components are substantially consumed. At times, the time before the increase of the overvoltage at the platinum electrode reaches its limit can be retarded markedly. In accordance with the present invention, it is also possible to prevent the deterioration of the electrode by increasing only the supported material component under the conditions in which the electrode reaction members are consumed, until the end of the life of the electrode. This eliminates the necessity of increasing the total quantity of the electrode reaction member components, as a whole, and saves the necessary resources. When the life of the electrode end while some of the electrode reaction member still remains, the life can be extended by increasing only the support without increasing the total quantity of the electrode reaction member as a whole. The quantity of the support consumed is much smaller than the consumption of an electrode which uses an oxide from the platinum group alone as the supported component, and the consumption of the supported material can be reduced in the present invention. For these reasons, the electrode of the present invention in which the support is three dimensionally supported by the supported material is really revolutionary because it can extend the life in comparison with electrodes using the components of the heretofore known metals from the platinum group or oxides from the platinum group as the electrode reaction member.
