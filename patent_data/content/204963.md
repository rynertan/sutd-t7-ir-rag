# Use of Alkali Soluble Polyorganosilsesquioxane Polymers in a resist for preparing electronics parts.

## Abstract
There are provided an alkali soluble siloxane polymer, an alkali soluble silmethylene polymer, and an alkali soluble polyorganosilsesquioxane polymer. They are useful as a photoresist for the fabrication of semiconductor devices. They are suitable for dry etching because of their superior resistance to oxygen plasmas.
