# Inorganic foams.

## Abstract
Strong rigid foams comprising one or more layer minerals useful as insulation and fire protection materials contain cells of which the mean diameter is below 60 microns, 90 have a diameter below 100 microns and substantially all are of diameter below 150 microns are made by gasifying an aqueous suspension of the layer mineral s to produce a wet foam or froth containing bubbles of gas of which the diameters are as stated above and removing water from the wet foam or froth.
