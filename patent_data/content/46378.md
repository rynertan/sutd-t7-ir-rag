# FLUID PRESSURE CONTROLLED TIME DELAY APPARATUS AND SYSTEM, AND FIRE FIGHTING INSTALLATION INCORPORATING SUCH SYSTEM

## Abstract
A time delay device, particularly for use with COâ‚‚ or other fire fighting installations, to introduce a predetermined delay for evacuation etc between the raising of alarm and the dis charge of the fire fighting medium. The device comprises a chamber 15 with an inlet controlled by a restricted orifice 16 and an outlet controlled by a bursting disc 17. When the alarm is raised high pressure gas is supplied to the inlet 10A and me tered through the orifice 16 into the chamber 15 until the pres sure in the chamber causes the disc 17 to rupture, the time taken for rupture depending on the size of the orifice 16, the capacity of the chamber 15 and the bursting pressure of the disc 17. When the disc ruptures a surge of pressurised gas passes through the outlet 11A to a pneumatic relay not shown to cause release of the fire fighting medium.
