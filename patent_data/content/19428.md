# Projectile locating apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus to determine the position of the trajectory of a bullet with an apparatus that may be totally concealed from the line of fire. A curved, elongate member 10 is used which is contacted by a shock or pressure wave generated by the projectile and transmits the resultant vibrations to the ends of the member, where they are converted to output signals from which a time difference signal is produced. A computer 76 calculates from the time difference signal the inclination angle of the projectile trajectory relative to a reference line. Two of the curved, elongate transducer assemblies at spaced locations out of the line of fire permit calculation of two such inclination angles and, therefrom, the location at which the projectile trajectory passes through a reference plane. The member 10 may be a rigid bar with transducer elements at each end, or a single piezoelectric member with pickup electrodes at each end.
