# Composite thermistor component and applications.

## Abstract
A component consisting of two coupled PTC thermistors 2,7 , the first thermistor 2 having a lower cold resistance than the second thermistor 7 and the first thermistor having a higher resistance at the operating temperature than the second thermistor. According to the invention, the electric connection to the second thermistor 7 is made directly by solely mechanical contacts to the surface of the ceramic ther mistor body. This means a considerable simplification during manufacture, as the second thermistor 7 need not be pro vided with electrode layers.
