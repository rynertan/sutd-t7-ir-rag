# Head for the circular coextrusion of a plurality of thermoplastic material layers.

## Abstract
Head for the coextrusion of N thermoplastic materials consisting of N 1 plates which are substantially modular and are assembled by form coupling constraint, each plate comprising a longitudinal conduit to feed one of said materials at least an annulaar semi collector distributor at least a semi channel a projection and a specular recess. The intermediate plates between the first and the last plate show a second semi collector and a second semi channel which by coupling with a precedent or successive semi collector respectively semi channel form a collector respectively a channel which extend annularly over the whole plate, the distributor section area and the channel length showing gradients over the 360 DEG .
