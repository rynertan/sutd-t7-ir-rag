# PHOTON EMITTERS AND IMAGE CONVERTERS COMPRISING PHOTON EMITTERS

## Abstract
A photon emitter which converts carriers from a low energy to a higher energy comprises a semiconductor body with a graded bandgap intrinsic conductivity region with an electric field impressed thereacross which causes electron or hole carriers under the influence of the electric field to move from a low energy gap region of the semiconductor body to a region that has a wider energy gap where recombination will produce a higher energy photon. The structure is useful in image conversion and electroluminescent detector applica tions.
