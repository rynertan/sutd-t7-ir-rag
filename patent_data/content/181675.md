# Process for the preparation of L alpha amino acid and D alpha amino acid amide.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of L α amino acid and D α amino acid amide from DL α amino acid amide by contacting the DL α amino acid amide in an aqueous solution with an α amino acyl amidase containing preparation obtained from a culture of Pseudomonas putida in the presence of traces of bivalent metal ions as activator, characterized in that the aqueous solution also contains a potassium salt selected from the group consisting of potas sium sulphate and potassium chloride. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of a L α amino acid and D α amino acid amide starting from the corresponding aldehyde, potassium cyanide and ammoniumsulphate, subsequent treatment with a ketone and potassiumhydroxide and finally subjecting to enzymatic hydrolysis with a preparation obtained from Pseudomonas putida.
