# Optical disc defect measurement by refraction.

## Abstract
A method for measuring the size of dimple type defects in an area of the surface of a flat piece of transparent material, such as an optical disc 10 . A large beam of collimated light 32 is provided and passed through the piece of material in a normal orientation with respect to the surface being inspected. A screen 48 is placed in the path of the beam emerging from the disc and circular shadows generated by refraction are measured to determine the size of the defects which produces them.
