# Fuel injection fuel control system.

## Abstract
A fuel control system for a fuel injected engine in cludes two vacuum control circuits, essentially identical in valve structure. One circuit controls the recirculation of exhaust gases into the engine intake manifold 14 and a change in engine ignition timing in response to engine throttle valve 34 angle by a regulator 310 , in response to changes in engine temperature by a signal reducer 312 , and in response to engine load by a manifold vacuum sen sitive valve 314 . A second circuit controls the engine fuel injection pump fuel flow rate as a function of changes in throttle valve angle by a valve 420 , engine temperature levels by a valve 422 , and load levels by a valve 424 to adjust an engine air fuel ratio controller 52 to maintain either a base air fuel ratio or air fuel ratios as called for by the particular engine operating conditions.
