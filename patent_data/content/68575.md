# Stacking device.

## Abstract
Device for stacking of articles 9 of which the upper most article of the stack is maintained automa tically at a certain level. The device comprises a vertical container 1 for the stack of articles, said container having an opening 2 at the upper side around which an annular flange 3 is arranged, on which a number of main tension springs 5 is suspended, which support the body part of a carrier, whereas the supporting plane part 8 of the carrier rests on the body part 7 of the carrier by means of preferentially a single central compression spring 10 . The strength of the supporting plane spring is weaker than that of the body springs, so that the sup porting plane moves down resiliently faster, and at loading with a stack of articles 9 also a great part of the carrier is used for the stack of articles and thereby an increase of capacity is obtained.
