# Knife abrasive apparatus for rotary drum shaped cutter.

## Abstract
A knife abrasive apparatus for a rotary drum shaped cutter can grind the knife edge without causing it serrated. It has a rotary drum shaped cutter including a rotary drum and knives spacedly disposed on the outer periphery of the drum at a predetermined helical angle to a virtual surface which blade edges of the knives will draw. It also has an abrasive wheel to be used for grinding the edges. The wheel is declined at the rotary center axis with respect to a vertical plane to the rotary center axis of the cutter so that a composite vector composed of a peripheral velocity vector of the cutter and that of the wheel will become parallel to each of the edges in the longitudinal direction of each of the knives. The velocity of rotation of the cutter and the wheel is controlled to maintain the ratio of the peripheral velocity of the former and the latter constant. The abrasive wheel is supported by a movable supporting member.
