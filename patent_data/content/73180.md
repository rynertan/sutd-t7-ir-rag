# Illuminating device for the visual determination of areas of caries on the surface of a tooth.

## Abstract
A device for the ocular determination of any discrepancy in the luminescence capacity of the surface of a tooth 4 for the purpose of assessing the extent of any part 4a of the surface of the tooth exhibiting caries and or a coating and or a defect. The surface of the tooth 4 is illuminated by means of a light 3 with a predetermined wavelength and or wave range, for example a laser light. The luminescence capacity of the surface of the tooth at another wavelength and or within another wave range shall be assessed, when any caried or similar part 4a will show a discrepancy in relation to the normal luminescence capacity of the tooth 4 and will be perceived as a darker area. If the surface of the tooth 4 is illuminated by means of a light which is visible to the eye, then the observer 5 shall use an absorption filter 6 capable of absorbing light at the emitted wavelength or wave range reflected from the surface of the tooth. The invention may also be used in the course of treatment in order to determine when the caried part has been removed from the enamel surface and or dentine surface produced by the treatment.
