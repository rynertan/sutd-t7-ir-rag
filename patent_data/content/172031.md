Any of the techniques known in the art can be employed to disseminate the compounds of this invention in a manner so as to achieve the desired contact with the organism to be controlled.Spraying and fumigating are typical of such techniques. The compounds of this invention can be readily utilized as bactericides and fungicides or combinations thereof in any locus, such as, for example, paper pulp processes, cooling towers, aqueous polymer dispersions, water based paints, seed treatment applications and the like. In addition, these compounds and compositions containing them can function as, for example, fabric or leather preservatives, wood preservatives, cosmetic preservatives, soap additives, sanitizing agents, such as in laundry soaps and detergents, and preservatives for metal working compounds, such as emulsifiable cutting oils, preservatives for fuels, fiber spin finish biocides and the like. In general, a locus subject to contamination by microorganisms can be protected in accordance with this invention by incorporating into the locus a sulfenylated acylhydrazone in an amount which is effective to control said microorganisms. The term wcontamination is meant to include any attack by microorganisms which leads to a chemical or physical breakdown or disintegration of the locus as well as the proliferation of the microorganisms within the locus without an accompanying deleterious effect.The exact amount of sulfenylated acylhydrazone required will, of course, vary with the medium being controlled, the particular sulfenylated acylhydrazone or compositions containing the sulfenylated acylhydrazone being employed and other factors. Typically, excellent control is obtained when the sulfenylated acylhydrazones are incorporated in the range of 0.1 to 10,000 parts per million ppm or up to about 95 based on the weight of the composition. A range of 0.5 to 2,500 ppm is preferred. The term .control as employed in the specification and claims of this application is to be construed as the effect of any means which adversely affects the existence or growth of any living organism or microorganism. This effect may comprise a complete killing action, eradication, arresting in growth, inhibition, reduction in number or any combination thereof. The sulfenylated acylhydrazones of this invention are especially useful as agricultural fungicides. As such, they are particularly valuable when formulated in a fungicidal composition. Such compositions normally comprise an agronomically acceptable carrier and a sulfenylated acylhydrazone or mixture of sulfenylated acylhydrazones as the active agent. Where necessary or desirable, surfactants or other additives may be incorporated to give uniformly formulated mixtures. By agronomically acceptable carrier is meant any substance which be utilized to dissolve, dispense or diffuse the chemical incorporated therein without impairing the effectiveness of the toxic agent and which does no permanent damage to such environment as soil, equipment and agronomic crops. For use as agricultural fungicides, the compounds of this invention are usually taken up in an agronomically acceptable carrier or formulated so as to render them suitable for subsequent dissemination. For example the sulfenylated acylhydrazone can be formulated as wettable powders, emulsion concentrates, dusts, granular formulations, aerosols or flowable emulsifiable concentrates. In such formulations, the sulfenylated acylhydrazones are extended with a liquid or solid carrier and, when desired, suitable surfactants are likewise incorporated. Certain compounds of this invention can be dissolved in a water miscible liquid, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, aromatic hydrocarbons and the like. Such solutions are easily extended with water. The sulfenylated acylhydrazones can be taken up on or mixed with a finely particled solid carrier as, for example, clays, inorganic silicates, carbonates, and silicas.Organic carriers can also be employed. Dust concentrates are commonly made wherein sulfenylated acylhydrazones are present in the range of from about 20 to about 80 by weight. For ultimate applications, these concentrates are normally extended with an additional solid to give an active ingredient content of from about 1 to about 20 . Wettable powder formulations are made by incorporating the compounds of this invention in an inert, finely divided solid carrier along with a surfactant which may be one or more emulsifying, wetting, dispersing or spreading agents or blend of these. The sulfenylated acylhydrazones are usually present in the range of from about 10 to about 80 by weight and the surfactants from about 0.5 to about 10 by weight. Commonly used emulsifying and wetting agents include polyoxyethylated derivatives of alkylphenols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, and alkylamines, alkylarene sulfonates and dialkyl sulfosuccinates. Spreading agents include such materials as glycerol mannitan laurate and a condensate of polyglycerol and oleic acid modified with phthalic anhydride.Dispersing agents include such materials as the sodium salt of the copolymer of maleic anhydride and an olefin such as diisobutylene, sodium lignin sulfonate and sodium formaldehydenaphthalene sulfonates. One convenient method for preparing a solid formulation is to impregnate the sulfenylated acylhydrazone toxicant onto the solid carrier by means of a volatile solvent, such as acetone. In this manner adjutants, such as activators, adhesives, plant nutrients, synergists and various surfactants, can also be incorporated. Emulsifiable concentrate formulations can be prepared by dissolving the sulfenylated acylhydrazones of this invention in an agronomically acceptable organic solvent and adding a solvent soluble emulsifying agent. Suitable solvents are usually water immiscible and may be found in the hydrocarbon, chlorinated hydrocarbon, ketone, ester, alcohol and amide classes of organic solvents. Mixtures of solvents are commonly employed. The surfactants useful as emulsifying agents may constitute from about 0.5 to about 10 by weight of the emulsifiable concentrate and may be anionic, cationic or non ionic in character. Anionic surfactants include alcohol sulfates or sulfonates, alkylarene sulfonates and sulfosuccinates. Cationic surfactants include fatty acid alkylamine salts and fatty acid alkyl quaternaries.Nonionic emulsifying agents include alkylene oxide adducts of alkylphenols, fatty alcohols, mercaptans and fatty acids. The concentration of the active ingredients may vary from about 10 to about 80 by weight, preferably in the range of about 25t to about 50 . For use as phytopathogenic agents, these compounds should be applied in an effective amount sufficient to exert the desired biocidal activity by techniques well known in the art. Usually, this will involve the application of the sulfenylated acylhydrazones to the locus to be protected in an effective amount when incorporated in an agronomically acceptable carrier. However, in certain situations, it may be desirable and advantageous to apply the compounds directly onto the locus to be protected without the benefit of any substantial amount of carrier. This is a particularly effective method when the physical nature of the sulfenylated acylhydrazone is such as to permit what is known as low volume application that is, when the compounds are in liquid form or substantially soluble in higher boiling solvents. The application rate will, of course, vary depending upon the purpose for such application, the sulfenylated acylhydrazones being utilized, the frequency of dissemination and the like. For use as agricultural bactericides and fungicides, dilute sprays can be applied at concentrations of from about 0.006 to about 2.397 kg of the active sulfenylated acylhydrazone ingredient per 100 liters of spray about 0.05 to about 20 pounds of the active sulfenylated acylhydrazone ingredient per 100 gallons of spray . They are usually applied at from about 0.012 to about 1.2 kg per 100 liters about 0.1 to about 10 pounds per 100 gallons and preferably at from about 0.015 to about 0.599 kg per 100 liters about 0.125 to about 5 pounds per 100 gallons . In more concentrated sprays, the active ingredient is increased by a factor of about 2 to 12. With dilute sprays, applications are usually made to the plants until run off is achieved whereas, with more concentrated or low volume sprays, the materials are applied as mists. The compounds of this invention may be utilized as the sole biocidal agents or they may be employed in conjunction with other fungicides, bactericides, algaecides, slimicides, insecticides, miticides, or with other comparable pesticides.
