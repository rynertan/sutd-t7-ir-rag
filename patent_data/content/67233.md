# MOUNTING EQUIPMENT FOR LEADLESS ELECTRONIC PARTS.

## Abstract
Mounting equipment for leadless electronic parts where in leadless electronic parts 3 , supplied through a cylindrical chute 5 , are dropped one by one into a part holding hole 7 with a partial cutout 7 of a part transporting pusher 6 , the part transporting pusher 6 transports the leadless electro nic part 3 between chucks 10, 11 , and then a main section block 8 including the chucks 10, 11 is pivoted so that the leadless electronic parts 3 are taken out and mounted at their mounting position on a printed circuit board 1 . A rapid and reliable mounting is thus obtained.
