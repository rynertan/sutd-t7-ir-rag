# Optical switch.

## Abstract
An optical switching device comprises an optical waveguide 1 formed from two light transmitting materials having an interface between them, and in which the refractive index of one of the materials 3 can be altered by an external influence the other has a light path directed at the interface at an angle such that by varying the refractive index of the first material 3 the light can either pass through the material or be reflected at the interface. By utilising a plurality of such interfaces in sequence the light may be selectively switched along several different paths.

## Description
This invention relates to an optical switching device. According to the invention an optical switching device comprises an optical waveguide incorporating two light transmitting materials with an interface between them, the refractive index of one of which materials can be altered by an external influence, and the other of which has a light path directed at said interface at an angle such that, at one value of refractive index of said one material the light path passes through the interface, but at another value of the refractive index of said one material the light is reflected at said interface in a different direction, the device incorporating or being associated with means for altering the refractive index of said one material from one said value to the other. The said one material, hereinafter referred to as the switching material, can be one whose refractive index can be altered by an electro optical or a magneto optical effect, that is to say one whose refractive index can be varied by the application of an electric or a magnetic field respectively. Alternatively the switching material may be one whose refractive index can be altered by incident light of an appropriate wavelength. Switching materials having refractive indices variable by other means could also be employed in some cases. The device may, for example, comprise a planar optical waveguide single or multimode having one or more channels formed in it to the depth of the waveguide material, the channel or channels containing said switching material, the waveguide material having a refractive index which is equal to the higher of two said values of refractive index of the switching material, means being provided for directing light along a path having an angle of incidence ϑ with the interface such that Accordingly when the refractive index of the switching material is at the higher of the two values no index discontinuity is encountered at the interface and the light, which may be linearly polarised, continues along its original path, whereas when the refractive index of the switching material is at the lower of the two values the light will be internally reflected at the interface and follow a different path. The waveguide material may have a plurality of parallel grooves each containing switching material. By this means, as will be subsequently described, light directed along one path within the waveguide material can be switched along a plurality of different paths by changing the refractive index of the switching material in different or different combinations of grooves. The invention is also applicable to devices incorporating channel waveguides instead of planar waveguide technology, the channel waveguides conveniently being associated with optical fibres for directing light into and away from input and output channels of the device, and the device incorporating a groove containing a switching material for effecting switching from one output channel to another. The switching material could be liquid crystal or an organic material such as Meta nitroanaline MNA . A number of different embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to Figures 1 to 5 of the accompanying schematic drawings, in which Referring first to Figure 1 the switch incorporates a planar optical waveguide structure single or multimode comprising a waveguide formed as a thin layer 1 on a substrate 2. The waveguide layer 1 has a channel 2 formed in it to a depth similar to the thickness of the waveguide for example, by laser processing, plasma etch or mechanical cutting techniques . The channel is typically 20 µm wide. This is then filled with a switching material 3 whose refractive index can be altered between two states say N The switching material 3 is switched between its two states, N Exact electrode arrangement depends on the orientation of the liquid crystal or organic electro optic material used. In the following description, it is assumed that the material has a negative electro optic coefficient, that is to say one whose refractive index decreases with an increase in the electric field across it. If the material has a positive coefficient then the electrode voltage conditions for OFF and ON states are reversed. Light may be launched into the waveguide, for example, using a prism coupling technique not shown along a path A. It is linearly polarised in such a direction that it sees the switching material refractive index as N The switch is turned ON by applying a voltage to the electrodes 4. The guiding light now sees an index N The switch described forms the basis of a non blocking 2x2 type. The structure may be extended to an n x n using the configuration as shown in Figure 3. In this case, the waveguide layer has a plurality, in this case five, grooves 2a 2e, and three light inputs A1, A2, A3. The central groove 2c has three switching positions 7c, the adjacent grooves 2b, 2d, two switching posiitons 7b, 7d and the outermost grooves 2a, 2e one 7a, 7e switching position respectively, each associated with respective electrodes so that each intersection of the light paths with the grooves is separately addressable. By appropriately varying the refractive index of the switching material 3 at appropriate intersection it will be seen that the light from each of the inputs can be directed either along a respective output path 01, 02, 03 or diverted along any one of the three output paths 04 to 06. The structure may be further developed to incorporate channel waveguides CW and butt coupled optical fibres 5, as shown in Figure 4, instead of planar waveguide technology. This illustrates a 2x2 switch of this type the fibres being held in abutment with the ends of the waveguides by fibre holding blocks 6 in known manner. The channel waveguides CW, the fibre holding blocks 6 and channel 2 can be formed by the same process as above described using reactive plasma etching. Alternatively, if the channel 2 of the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 is filled with a photo refractive material, guiding light of a higher optical wavelength could be switched by illuminating the switch material 3 with light of a smaller wave length which causes the change in refractive index. This activating light L would be supplied by a fibre 8 held immediately above each operation point as shown in Figure 5 or alternatively the activating light could be input with the waveguiding light, using wavelength multiplexing. Switching may also be achieved in other ways, using the same structure. Thus in a modification of the invention above described the channel or channels may be filled with a highly birefringent material, then switching between the two states will take place if the input polarisation of the light is changed. This could be achieved using an electro optic or magneto optic effect.
