# A method of forming a patterned photoresist layer.

## Abstract
A photoresist that has strong resistance to reactive ion etching, high photosensitivity to mid and deep UV light, and high resolution capability is formed by using as the resist material a copolymer of methacrylonitrile and methacrylic acid, and by baking the resist in two stages, one before the exposure to light for improved photosensitivity, and one after exposure to light, development, and prior to treatment with reactive ion etching.
