# Process for methane and ammonia extraction from organic waste.

## Abstract
A process for extracting methane gas and ammonia from raw material, such as organic waste The process is carried out in a closed container or digester by anaerobic bacteria. The yield of the conventional anaerobic bacteria digestion process is greatly increased by the novel step of maintaining the space in the digester above the level of the raw material at a pressure below atmospheric during the digestion process.
