# Digital switching network for switching signals of different bit rates.

## Abstract
Digital switching network for switching through subrate channels. The multiplexed subscriber s channels contain eight bit words, each bit of which can form part of another signal. The number of bits in each word for a single signal is determined by the original rate of the signal. Each of the signals must have the possibility of being switched through to another destination. For that purpose it may be necessary to change the position of bits within a frame. Hence a separate time 6 and space step 4 has been arranged between the input time step 2 and the switching matrix 8 . After that the switching matrix switches through eight bit words. The positions of bits within a word can be exchanged in an additional space step 10 between the switching matrix 8 and the output time step 12 in order to make it possible to fill the outgoing frames as completely as possible.
