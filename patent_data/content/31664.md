# Internal combustion engine starter motor control arrangements.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine starter motor control in cludes a solenoid with pull in and holding windings 14 and 15 and a main contact 12 . The pull in winding 14 is connected in series with the starting switch 18 and the motor 10, 11 a cross the battery 13 , the holding winding 15 being connect ed across the series combination of the pull in winding 14 and the motor 10, 11 . The main contact 12 connects the motor 10, 11 directly for the battery and means are provided for ensuring that, whilst sufficient current can flow through the pull in winding 14 to index the motor 10, 11 during pull in, the main contacts are not held closed after the starter switch 18 is opened by current flowing through the main contacts and the two windings in series. To this end, a resistor 16 and diode 17 in series are connected across the pull in winding to pass extra current during pull in. Alternatively, a diode may be connected in series with the pull in winding.

## Description
This invention relates to internal combustion engine s3rbr motor control arrangements. In a conventional starter motor control arrangement the motor is connected in series with a pull in winding of a solenoid and a starter switch across a supply, a hold in winding of the solenoid being connected in parallel with the series combination of the pull in winding and the motor, and a main contact operable by the solenoid being connected across the series combination of the starter switch and the pull in winding. With such an arrangement when the starter switch is closed current flows through both the windings and establishes a high pull force so that the solenoid displaces a pinion driven by the motor into engagement with an engine flywheel. Assuming tooth to tooth abutment does not occur the main contact is made, shorting out the pull in winding and energising the motor, the solenoid remaining energised by virtue of current in the hold in winding only. Should toothto tooth abutment occur, the pinion is spring loaded to allow the solenoid to travel to close the main contacts.Initial turning of the motor releases the abutment and allows the pinion to travel hone under its spring load. This arrangement suffers greatly from damage to the gears caused by shock loads following tooth to tooth abutment. Although the problem could be alleviated by allowing low power indexing of the motor during pull in conventional solenoid design makes this difficult because of the need to ensure that the solenoid is de energised properly when the switch is opened, since current can flow through the main contacts and the two windings in series when the switch is open. To ensure that the solenoid is de energised the two windings need approximately the same number of turns and this prevents the pull in winding being made with a sufficiently low resistance to permit low power indexing. It is one object of the present invention to provide a starter motor control arrangement in which this disadvantage is overcome. According to one aspect of the invention a supplementary current path is provided in parallel with the pull in winding, so as to provide sufficient current to the motor during pull in to index the motor, said supplementary current path including a unidirectional current flow device. According to another aspect of the inv.ention, the pullin winding is connected to the motor via a unidirectional current flow device. In the acoompanying drawings Figure 1 is the circuit diagram of one example of a starter motor control arrangement in accordance with the invention, and Figures 2 and 3 are circuit diagrams of two alternative examples of the invention. In the system shown in Figure 1 the motor armature 10 and field winding 11 are connected in series with the main contacts 12 across the 12v battery 13. The contacts 12 are operated by a solenoid having two windings 14 and 15 with equal numbers of turns. The pull in winding 14 is connected at one end by a starter switch 18 to the battery ve and at the other end to the junction between the contacts 12 and the field winding 11. A resistor 16 in series with a unidirection current flow device in the form of a semiconductor diode 17 provides a supplementary current path in parallel with the winding 140 The winding 15 connects the junction of the winding 14 and the switch 18 to the ve pole of the battery. When switch 18 is closed, sufficient total current flows through the winding 14 and the resistor 16 to cause the motor to turn slowly and avoid tooth to tooth abutment problems. A hen the contacts 12 close the motor operates at full power and winding 14 is shorted out as is conventional.On opening of switch 1S, however, no reverse current can flow through the diode 17 so that the flux in windings 14 and 15 cancels out permitting immediately release of the solenoid. Turning now to Figure 2 the arrangement differs from that shown in Figure 1 in that the diode 117 is in series with the winding 114. Thus the latter can be provided with fewer turns than usual so that its resistance is low enough to allow it to pass sufficient motor current to index the motor during pull in. Diode 117 prevents reverse current flow through winding 114 when switch 18 opens. A resistor 116 may be connected in parallel with the winding 114, to adjust the initial motor current independently of the windings. In the Figure 3 arrangement an additional battery 113 is connected in series with the battery 13 and the main contacts 12, the switch 18 being connected to the battery 13 as before. The arrangement is otherwise the same as that shown in Figure 2. Indexing occurs during pull in, but 24v is applied to the motor when the contacts 12 close.The diode 117 prevents reverse current through winding 114, both when switch 18 open as before, and also when the contacts 12 close and switch 18 is still closed. The diode 117 also serves to isolate the switch 18 and 12v solenoid windings 114, 15 from the 24v starter motor 10. Without the diode 117, it would be necessary to use 24v solenoid windings and an additional relay to control the current supply to the windings from a 12v switch.
