# Calibration method and apparatus for optical response tissue examination instrument.

## Abstract
A device 50 100 for calibrating optical response tissue examination apparatus is coupled between the sending and receiving components of the apparatus the equipment is then run through a test cycle to thereby project selected light spectra into an inlet 119, 121 to the calibration device and receive such light as it emerges from the calibration device through an outlet 170 after passing along a tortuous path 122, 133, 128 156, 158, 162, 164 . The calibration device provides known, standardized light transfer characteristics diffusion and attenuation which condition the detected emergent light energy in a known and precisely repeatable manner, whereby such conditioned light energy may be used to analytically characterize the optical response apparatus itself. The calibration device incorporates a sample cell 154 whereby the emergent light energy may also be particularly characterized in terms of the known effects on light transfer caused by the selected media. Two or more such media may be utilized so that the emergent ligth characterized by each different media may be mutually compared, to thereby establish calibration constants for the overall optical capabilities of the optical response apparatus under calibration. Thus, in subsequent operation of the calibrated apparatus, during actual tissue examination, the calibration constants so determined may be used to modify nominal tissue examination data and convert it into intrinsically accurate form which may be directly compared on a meaningful quantified basis to any other similarly calibrated tissue examination apparatus.
