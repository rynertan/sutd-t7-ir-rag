# Novel carbonaceous pitch, process for the preparation thereof and use thereof to make carbon fibers.

## Abstract
A novel reformed mesophase pitch is provided which has a mesophase content MC of between 40 and 100 , a quinoline insoluble content QI of between 5 and 70 weight and anisotropic domains forming a substantially continuous phase and which is obtained by heat treating a hydrogenated isotropic pitch. The reformed mesophase pitch preferably has a softening point SP in DEG C satisfying the following conditions when 40 MC 100, 0.4MC 170 SP 1.25MC 170 and SP 1.33QI 220 and when MC 100, 210 SP 313 and SP 1.33QI 220. The reformed mesophase pitch is useful as precursor materials for carbon fibers.
