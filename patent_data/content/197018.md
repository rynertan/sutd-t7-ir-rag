## Description
The present invention relates to novel, pharmacologically active compounds and to intermediates and a process for their preparation. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds useful for the treatment of inflammatory, allergic, muscoskeletal or dermatological conditions. The object of the invention is to provide a glucocorticosteroid which possesses high anti inflammatory potency on the place of application and low glucocorticoid systemic potency. It is known that certain glucocorticosteroids GCS can be used for local therapy of inflammatory, allergic or immunologic diseases in respiratory airways e.g. asthma, rhinitis , in skin eczema, psoriasis or in bowel ulcerative colitis, Morbus Crohn . With such local glucocorticoid therapy, clinical advantages over general therapy with e.g. glucocorticoid tablets are obtained, especially regarding reduction of the unwanted glucocorticoid effects outside the diseased area. To reach such clinical advantages, in e.g. severe respiratory airway disease, GCS must have a suitable pharmacological profile. They should have high intrinsic glucocorticoid activity at the application site but also a rapid inactivation by e.g. hydrolysis in the target organ or after uptake into the general circulation. Since binding of GCS to the glucocorticoid receptor is a pre requisite for their anti inflammatory and allergic effects to occur, the ability of steroids to bind to their receptor s can be used as an adequate method for determining the biological activity of GCS. A direct correlation between the affinity of GCSs to the receptor and their antiinflammatory effects has been shown using ear edema test in the rat. Correlation between chemical structure, receptor binding, and biological activity of some novel, highly active. 16α,17α acetalsubstituted glucocorticoids. E. Dahlberg, A. Thalén, R. Brattsand, J The present invention is based on the observation that certain 3 oxo androsta 1,4 diene 17α carboxylic acid esters possess high binding affinity to the glucocorticosteroid receptor.

The compounds of the invention are prepared by the oxidation of a compound of the formulas X, XI and XII to the corresponding 17β carboxylic acid wherein The 17β carboxylic acids then are esterified to give compounds characterized by the formula I IX, wherein The process of this invention to convert a compound of formulas X, XI or XII to the corresponding 17 carboxylic acids is carried out in a suitable oxygenated hydrocarbon solvent such as a lower alkanol. Methanol and ethanol are preferred, particularly the former. The reaction medium is made slightly alkaline by the addition of a suitable weak inorganic base such as an alkali metal carbonate, for example sodium, lithium or potassium carbonate. The latter is preferred. The conversion of a compound of formula X, XI or XII to a 17β carboxylic acid of formula I, II or III R₃ H takes place at ambient temperatures, i.e. 20 25 C. The presence of oxygen is necessary for the reaction. Oxygen can be supplied by bubbling a stream of air or oxygen into the reaction mixture. The oxidative degradation of the 17β side chain of compounds of formula X, XI and XII to the corresponding 17β carboxylic acids can also be carried out with periodic acid, sodium hypobromate or with sodium bismuthate. The reaction is performed in a mixture of water and a suitable oxygenated hydrocarbon solvent such as a lower ether. Dioxane and tetrahydrofurane are preferred, particularly the former. The parent 17β carboxylic acids of compounds of formula I, II and III R₃ H may be esterified in known manner to provide 17β carboxylate esters according to the invention. For example, the 17β carboxylic acid may be reacted with an appropriate alcohol and a carbodiimide, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in a suitable solvent such as diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, methylene chloride or pyridine advantageously at a temperature of 25 100 C. Alternatively, a salt of the 17β carboxylic acid with an alkali metal, e.g. lithium, sodium or potassium, a salt of a quaternary ammonium compound, such as a salt of triethyl or tributylamine, or tetrabutylammonium, may be reacted with an appropriate alkylating agent, for example an acyloxyalkylhalide or haloalkyl alkylcarbonate preferably in a polar solvent medium such as acetone, methylethylketone or dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, methylenechloride or chloroform, conveniently at a temperature in the range 25 100 C. The reaction may also be performed in the presence of a crown ether. The crude steroid ester derivatives formed are after isolation purified by chromatography on a suitable material, for instance cross linked dextran gels of Sephadex LH type with suitable solvents as eluants, e.g. halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters such as ethyl acetate or acetonitrile. The individual epimers, which are formed at the acetalisation of the 16α,17α hydroxy groups or at the esterification of the 17β carboxylic acids, possess practically identical solubility characteristics. Accordingly, they have turned out to be impossible to separate and isolate from the epimeric mixture by conventional method for resolution of stereoisomers. e.g. fractionated crystallization. In order to obtain the individual epimers separately the stereoisomeric mixtures according to the formulas I, IV and V above are subjected to column chromatography. thus separating the epimes II, III, VI, VII, VIII and IX in view of different mobility on the stationary phase. The chromatography may be carried out for instance on cross linked dextran gels of the type Sepnadex LH. e.g. Sephadex LH 20 in combination with a suitable organic solvent as eluting agent. Sephadex LH 20, prepared by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB. Uppsala, Sweden, is a beadformed hydroxypropylated dextran gel wherein the dextran chains are cross linked to give a three dimensional polysaccharide network. As eluting agent, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. chloroform or a mixture of heptane chloroform ethanol in the proportions 0 50 50 100 10 1 has successfully been used, preferably a 20 20 1 mixture. The compounds of the invention may be used for different modes of local administration dependent on the site of inflammation, e.g. percutaneously, parenterally or for local administration in the respiratory tract by inhalation. An important aim of the formulation design is to reach optimal bioavailability of the active steroid ingredient. For percutaneous formulations this is advantageously achieved if the steroid is dissolved with a high thermodynamic activity in the vehicle. This is attained by using a suitable system of solvents comprising suitable glycols, such as propylene glycol or 1,3 butandiol either as such or in combination with water. It is also possible to dissolve the steroid either completely or partially in a lipophilic phase with the aid of a surfactant as a solubilizer. The percutaneous compositions can be an ointment, an oil in water cream, a water in oil cream or a lotion. In the emulsion vehicles the system comprising the dissolved active component can make up the disperse phase as well as the continuous one. The steroid can also exist in the above compositions as a micronized, solid substance. Pressurized aerosols for steroids are intended for oral or nasal inhalation. The aerosol system is designed in such a way that each delivered dose contains 10 1000 µg, preferably 20 250 µg of the active steroid. The most active steroids are administered in the lower part of the dose range. The micronized steroid consists of particles substantially smaller than 5 µm, which are suspended in a propellent mixture with the assistance of a dispersant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin or sodium salt of dioctylsulphosuccinic acid. The invention will be further illustrated by the following non limitative examples. In the examples a flow rate of 2.5 ml cm² h ¹ is used at the preparative chromatographic runs. Molecular weights are in all examples determined with electron impact mass spectrometry and the melting points on a Leitz Wetzlar hot stage microscope. All HPLC analyses HPLC High Performance Liquid Chromatography were performed on a Waters µßondapak C₁₈ column 300x3.9 mm internal diameter with a flow rate of 1.0 ml min and with ethanol water in ratios between 50 50 and 60 40 as mobile phase, if not otherwise stated. 6α,9α Difluoro 11β hydroxy 16α,17α 1 methylethylidene bis oxy androsta 1,4 diene 3 one 17β carboxylic acid 500 mg and potassium hydrogen carbonate 575 mg were dissolved in 40 ml of dimethylformamide. 1 chloroethyl acetate 1 ml was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 h. The reaction mixture was poured into 50 ml of water and extracted with methylene chloride. The extract was washed with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and water, dried and evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on Sephadex LH 20 column 72x6.3 cm using chloroform as mobile phase. The fractions 1755 2025 and 2026 2325 ml were collected and evaporated. The solid product from fraction 1755 2025 ml was further purified by chromatography on a sephadex LH 20 column 76x6.3 cm i.d. using a mixture of heptane chloroform ethanol, 20 20 1, as mobile phase.

Melting point 261 65 C. α 25 D 34 c 0.262 CH₂Cl₂ . The molecular weight was 524. The ¹H NMR spectra of A and B are nearly identical with the exception of the methine quartet from the ester group which is shifted 0.16 ppm downfield in compound B compared to A. The fragmentation patterns of A and B in electron impact mass spectra are identical apart from the intensities of the mass peaks. These spectroscopic properties of A and B indicate that they are epimers due to the chiral centre in the ester group.

The affinity of the novel androstane 17β carboxylic acid esters to the glucocorticoid receptor has been used as a model for determination of the anti inflammatory potency. Their receptor affinities have been compared to budesonide 22R,S 16α,17α butylidenedioxy 11β,21 dihydroxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione a highly active glucocorticoid with a favourable ratio between local and systemic effects Thalén and Brattsand, Arzneim. Forsch. Male Sprague Dawley rats, one to two months of age, were used throughout the investigation. The thymus was removed and put into ice cold saline. The tissue was homogenized in a Potter Elvehjem homogenizer in 10 ml of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 w v glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaMoO₄, 10 mM mercaptoethanol. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 x g. Portions of the 20,000 x g supernatant 230 µl were incubated for about 24 h at 0 C with 100 µl phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride an esterase inhibitor, final conc. 0.5 mM , 20 µl unlabelled competitor and 50 µl ³H labelled dexammethasone final conc. 3 nM . Bound and free steroid were separated by incubating the mixture with 60 µl 2.5 w v charcoal and 0.25 w v dextran T70 suspension in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM MaMoO₄ for 10 min at 0 C. Following a centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min, 230 µl of the supernatant was counted in 10 ml Insta Gel in a Packard scintillation spectrophotometer. The supernatants were incubated with a ³H dexamethasone alone, b ³H dexamethasone plus 1000 fold excess of unlabelled dexamethasone and c ³H dexamethasone plus 0.03 300 fold excess of competitor. The nonspecific binding was determined when 1000 fold excess of unlabelled dexamethasone was added to ³H labelled dexammethasone. The radioactivity bound to the receptor in the presence of competitor divided by the radioactivity bound to the receptor in the absence of competitor multiplied by 100 gives the percentage specific binding of labelled dexamethasone. For each concentration of a competitor the percentage specifically bound radioactivity is plotted against the log of concentration of competitor. The curves are compared at the 50 specific binding level and referenced to budesonide, which is assigned a relative binding affinity RBA of 1.
