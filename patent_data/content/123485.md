# Colon specific prodrug, the preparation and uses thereof.

## Abstract
A colon specific drug delivery system is based on the use of a synthetic drug glycoside prodrug composition which, when ingested by a mammal, undergoes reaction with glycosidases produced by colonic microflora to release a free drug capable of being absorbed to or absorbed by the intesti nal mucosa. Hitherto, synthetic drug glycosides useful in the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the colon were not known.

## Description
COLON SPECIFIC PRODRUG, THE PREPARATION AND USES THEREOF This invention relates to a colon specific drug delivery system. More specifically, the invention relates to a colon specific drug delivery system based on the use of a synthetic drug glycoside prodrug composition which, when ingested by a mammal, undergoes reaction with glycosidases produced by colonic microflora to release a free drug capable of being adsorbed to or absorbed by the intestinal mucosa. In recent years there has been increased emphasis on ways to deliver or activate drugs at specific sites in order to reduce side effects and increase pharmacological response. Implantable pumps, adhesive patches impregnated with drugs, vesicle enclosed drugs, and drug carriers have been proposed to achieve site specific delivery. Another approach has been to use prodrugs See Stella, V.J. and Bimmelstein, K.J., J. Med. Chem. 23 1275 1282 1980 Sinkula, A.A.and Yalkosky, S.H., J. Pharm. Sci. 64 181 210 1975 which, by virtue of their physicochemical properties, can reach specific sites and then be converted to the active drug in situ. The site specific delivery of prodrugs administered systemically to the kidney, brain, breasts, or the central nervous system or topically to the eyes or skin have been reported. In all these cases, the parent drug is released chemically or by specific enzyme s present at the target site. It is known that colon specific delivery of bioactive compounds occurs in man. Anthraquinone cathartics and the carcinogen cyasin are naturally occurring glycosides found in plants. See Scheline,R.R., J. Harm. Sci. 57 2021 2137 1968 . Upon ingestion, these substances pass unabsorbed to the large intestine, where the bioactive moieties are released by the enzymatic action of the colonic microflora. The azo reductase activity of the colonic microflora is now known to activate certain sulfa drugs by reducing the azo bond present in such compounds.See Mandel, G.L. and Sande, M.A. in ThePharmacological Basis of Therapeutics , Sixth Ed. A.G.Gilman, L.S. Goodman, and A. Gilman, Eds. MacMillan,New York, N.Y., log80 pp. 1106 1165. Also, the reduction of the azo link between an unabsorbed polymer and certain aromatic amines form the basis of a recently developed colon specific drug delivery system.See Parkinson, T.M., Brown, J.P., and Winegard, R.E.,U.S. Patent 4,190,716 Feb. 26, 1980 and Brown, J.P., Appi Enviro. Microbiol. 41 1283 1286 1981 . It is also known that the intestinal microflora have unique enzymatic activities capable of hydrolyzing a number of specific chemical bonds. SeeDrasar, B.S. and Hill, M.J., Buman Intestinal Flora ,Academic Press, London, 1974 pp 54 71. However, prior to the present invention it was not known that following ingestion by a mammal, a colon specific drug glycoside would pass through the stomach and small intestine without being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous mucosal enzymes produced by the mammalian host. In addition, prior to the present invention it was not known that such a drug glycoside prodrug would pass into the area of the colon where it would be essentially cleaved by the glycosidase activity of colonic microflora.Prior to the teaching of the present invention, it was also not known that once such cleavage of the prodrug occurred, a free drug capable of being adsorbed to or absorbed by the intestinal mucosa would be released. Such a synthetic prodrug comprised of a drug glycoside has advantages over the compounds used in the colon specific delivery systems of the prior art. The fact that the prodrug is synthetic makes it possible to create drug glycosides not found in nature. For example, synthetic drug glycosides are disclosed herein that are useful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, a condition which carries an increased risk of colon cancer, and other forms of inflammatory bowel disease.Natural drug glycosides useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease are not found in nature.Synthetic drug glycosides of the type disclosed herein will also be useful in the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the colon and then to liver metastases with minimal damage to the stomach and small intestine.Synthetic drug glycosides useful in the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the colon are not found in nature. The drug glycosides of the present invention utilize simple sugars as the disabling moiety that substantially prevents liberation or absorption of the free drug until the prodrug reaches the area of the colon. Colonic microfloral glycosidases then act upon the drug glycoside, liberating the sugar moiety from the drug moiety. These liberated sugar residues can be utilized as an energy source by the intestinal bacteria. Although the nonabsorbable polymeric backbone utilized in the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,190,716 may prove harmless to patients exposed to the polymers for considerable lengths of time, the long term effect of these compounds has not yet been evaluated. On the other hand, the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed herein leaves no such unnatural waste compound for the body to contend with. It is an aspect of the invention to provide a colon specific drug delivery system useful for the treatment of disease that will utilize a synthetic prodrug comprised of a drug glycoside capable of being essentially cleaved by glycosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora but not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host, thus enabling the most significant amounts of free drug to be released in the area of the colon following cleavage of the drug glycoside by glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a colon specific drug delivery system useful for the treatment of disease that will utilize a synthetic prodrug comprised of a steroid glycoside capable of being essentially cleaved by glycosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora but not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host, thus enabling the most significant amounts of free drug to be released in the area of the colon following cleavage of the drug glycoside by glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a colon specific synthetic prodrug composition comprised of a steroid glycoside capable of being essentially cleaved by beta galactosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora but not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host, thus enabling the most significant amounts of free drug to be released in the area of the colon following cleavage of the drug glycoside by glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a colon specific synthetic prodrug composition comprised of a steroid glycoside capable of being essentially cleaved by alpha galactosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora but not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host thus enabling the most significant amounts of free drug to be released in the area of the colon following cleavage of the drug glycoside by glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a method for producing a colon specific synthetic prodrug composition comprised of a steroid glycoside capable of being essentially cleaved by beta glucosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora but not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host thus enabling the most significant amounts of free drug to be released in the area of the colon following cleavage of the drug glycoside by glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a method for producing a colon specific synthetic prodrug composition comprised of a steroid drug glycoside capable of being essentially cleaved by beta cellobiosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora but not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host thus enabling the most significant amounts of free drug to be released in the area of the colon following cleavage of the drug glycoside by glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora.

IN VIVO TESTING Male, Sprague Dawley rats ca 250 g were maintained on laboratory rat chow and water ad lib.These rats were fasted overnight 16 hr. prior to administration of glucoside or free steroid. Water bottles were removed from the cages at least 30 min prior to drug administration. Prednisolone glucoside, X, 7.5 mg or dexamethasone glucoside, 1, 7.5 mg was administered by gastric intubation as a solution 0.5 mL of water 95 ethanol 3 1 . Prednisolone, 4, 5.25 mg or dexamethasone, 3, 5.1 mg was administered as a solution 0.5 mL of water 95 ethanol 1 1 . After the appropriate interval of time 3, 4, 5 or 6 hr. the animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide anesthesia followed by thoractomy. The small intestine and cecum were removed and cut into segments.Contents were separated from the tissues by rinsing the segments with cold, 0.98 saline 5.0 mL . The contents were immediately diluted to 30 mL with methanol. The tissues were suspended in 0.01 M RE2P04 5.0 mL . Then an internal standard, either prednisolone, 4, or dexamethasone, 3, depending on the experimental steroid, was added to all the samples. Both the contents and tissues were then homogenized with aPolytron Homogenizer Brinkman Inst. Co. at med. speed for 1 2 min. The contents were then diluted to 40 mL total volume with methanol. The tissues were diluted to 25 mL total volume with methanol.All the samples were centrifuged 5,000g, 15 min and then the supernatant solutions were passed through membrane filters 0.45 micrometersr Versapor 800 . The samples 1.4 mb were then diluted with 0.01 M KH2PO4 0.6 mL and 20 microliters of the resulting solution injected directly onto the HPLC column for analysis.IN VITRO TESTING Prednisolone glucoside, X, 5.0 mg or dexamethasone glucoside, 1, 5.0 mg was incubated at 370C in an 0.05 X acetate buffer, pH 5.0 10.0 mL with beta glucosidase EC 3.2.1.21, from almonds, one unit liberates 1.0 micromole of glucose from salicin per min at pH 5.0 at 37 C . Prednisolone glucoside, 2, and dexamethasone glucoside, 1, were treated with 50 and 500 units of enzyme, respectively.At various times, aliquots 0.1 mLr were removed and quenched with methanol 9.9 mL . After centrifugation 5,000g, 10 min 1 the samples were diluted 1 1 with 0.01 X KH2PO4 and 20 microliters of the resulting solution injected directly onto the HPLC column for analysis. Glucosides 1 and 2 5.0 mg were also incubated at 370C with homogenized rat feces 0.5 g 10 milliliters 0.01 N phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 . The feces were obtained from rats maintained on a high cellulose diet. See Shiau, S.Y., Chang, G.W. J.Nutr., 113 136 1983 . Aliquots 0.2 milliliters were removed and quenched with MeOH 3.66 milliliters .After centrifugation 5,000a, 10 min , the samples were passed through membrane filters 0.45 micrometer pore,Versapor 450, Gelman Sciences, Inc. . They were then diluted 1 1 with 0.01 X KH2PO4. Twenty microliters of the resulting solution were injected directly onto the HPLC column for analysis. IN VITRO METABOLISM Rates of hydrolysis of three e nitrophenyl glycoside substrates, p nitrophenyl beta D glucoside p NP glc , p nitrophenyl beta D galactoside NP gal , and p nitrophenyl beta D cellobioside g NP cel , were measured in homogenized contents of the rat stomach, proximal small intestine PSI , distal small intestine DSI and cecum. The entire small intestine was divided into two, equal length segments to give PSI and DSI. Gastrointestinal contents were obtained from male, Sprague Dawley rats 300 400 g which had been maintained on a stock diet Purina rat chow and water ad libitum. The intestinal contents of each section were pooled from four animals for each assay.Pooling the gut contents from four animals would be expected to lower the SD by a factor of two.Foliowing removal, the contents were quickly weighed, then diluted to 100 milliliters stomach, PSI, and DSI or 200 milliliters cecum with cold 0.01 X phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The diluted contents were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer Brinkman Instrument Co. at medium speed for 1 2 min and the solution pE measured. Homogenates were then stored on ice ca 30 min . Homogenates 0.8 milliliters of stomach and PSI, 0.2 milliliters of DSI, and 0.04 milliliters of cecum were added to the appropriate substrate solution 0.01 N phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 to give 1.0 mM substrate total volume 2.25 milliliters . The reaction was run at 370C in a shaking water bath.The reaction was stopped after 10, 20, or 30 min by addition of 0.2 NNaOH 0.25 milliliters . The amount of nitrophenol released was measured spectrophotometrically at 403 nm. Rates of hydrolysis of glycoside prodrugs 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 were measured in the same manner except that a higher concentration of each homogenate was used. Stomach and PSI contents were diluted to 50 mL with 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0,DSI contents to 25 mL, and cecal contents to 200 m s, prior to homogenization.The homogenates 2.1 mL of stomach, PSI, and DSI and 1.7 mL of cecum were added to the appropriate substrate solution 0.01 N phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 to give 1.0 mM substrate in a total volume of 2.5 mL. At various times up to 30 min, aliquots 0.3 mL were removed and quenched with MeOH 4.7 mL . After centrifugation 5,000 g, 10 min , the samples were diluted 1 1 with 0.01 X KH2PO4 and 20 microliters of the resulting solution was injected directly onto the HPLC column for analysis. KM app and VMax Determinations. The KM app Vmax for the hydrolysis of g NP glc and p NP gal were determined using pooled cecal homogenates 200 mb as described above. A range of substrate 56 1000 micromolar final volume 2.25 mL concentrations, spanning their apparent KM, was used for each reaction. The amount of cecal homogenate used was 0.04 mL Velocities were obtained, in duplicate, at 370C in a shaking water bath and the reaction stopped by addition of 0.2 N NaOH 0.25 mL after 15 min. Release of p nitrophenol was measured spectrophotometrically at 403 nm. Eadie Hofstee plots were used to determine the KM app micromolar andVmax micromolar min g of both reactions. The wet weight g , measured immediately after removal and pooling, was used throughout. The KM app and Vmax were also measured from the hydrolysis of glycoside prodrugs 1, X, 5, 1, e, 10, 11 and 12. Again, cecal contents from four rats were pooled, weighed, diluted 100 mL, 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and homogenized. A range of substrate concentrations 0.5 48 micromolar, final volume 2.5 mL spanning the apparent Rg, was used for each reaction.The amount of cecal homogenate used was 0.8 mL.Reactions were run, in duplicate, at 370C in a shaking water bath. After 15 min, the reactions were stopped by removing aliquots 0.3 mL and quenching them withMeOH 4.7 mL . Following centrifugation 5,000g, 10 min , the samples were diluted 1 1 with 0.01 M KH2PO4 and 20 microliters of the resulting solution was injected directly onto the HPLC column for analysis.Again, Eadie Hofstee plots were used to determine the KM app and VMax. Determrnation of Apparent Partition Coefficients. The partitioning of prodrugs and free steroids between n octanol and an aqueous phase 0.01 phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 were determined at 370C.Both octanol and buffer were saturated with the relevant aqueous or organic phase before use. Equal volumes 1.0 mL of both phases were used and agitated for 30 min. The initial concentration of glycoside was 10 mM, dissolved in the aqueous phase. The intitial concentration of steroid was 10 mM dissolved in the organic phase. The amount of glycoside and free steroid in the aqueous phase at equilibrium was measured spectrophotometrically at 239 nm for the dexamethasone and fludrocortisone compounds and 242 nm for the prednisolone and hydrocortisone compounds. The concentration of glycoside or free steroid in the octanol phase was determined by difference. Very generally, the invention discloses a colon specific drug delivery system based on the use of a synthetic prodrug composition. The prodrug is comprised of the combination of an aglycone attached to a sugar by means of a glycosidic link. According to the invention, the aglycone is a drug composition, the sugar is a sugar recognizable as a substrate by bacterial glycosidases produced by colonic microflora, and the glycosidic link is a glycosidic link capable of being cleaved by the glycosidase enzymatic action of colonic microflora following recognition of the sugar as a substrate by the bacterial glycosidases.Also according to the invention, the prodrug combination is of sufficient size and hydrophilicity to allow it to pass through the mammalian gastrointestinal tract without being absorbed from the gaastrointestinal tract or without being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host. As a result, the prodrug will reach the area of the mammalian colon where the glycosidic link on the prodrug will be cleaved by the colonic bacterial glycosidases to release free drug most significantly to the colonic area of the bowel. More specifically, the invention discloses a colon specific drug delivery system based on the use of a synthetic prodrug composition, the prodrug being comprised of an aglycone moiety attached to a sugar moiety by means of a glycosidic link thereby producing a drug glycoside. The aglycone moiety of the prodrug composition useful in the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed herein will preferably be comprised of a drug that is most efficacious when its adsorption or absorption is essentially limited to the area of the colon. Such drugs include steroid and antibiotic drugs useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.When these drugs are absorbable, they will generally be more lipophilic than hydrophilic, and will be small enough to pass through the gastrointestinal mucosa, since, as is well known, lipophilic substances generally penetrate membranes more readily then hydrophilic substances do, and smaller molecules penetrate more readily than larger ones. Steroid drugs, antibiotics and cancer chemotherapeutic agents are preferred aglycone moieties for use in the prodrugs of the present invention. Especially preferred are steroid drugs, including prednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. The sugar moiety of the prodrug composition useful in the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed herein will be comprised of a sugar moiety recognizable as a substrate by glycosidases produced by bacteria present in the mammalian intestine. Since the hydrolytic action of these bacterial glycosidases is the mechanism by which the glycosidic bond, linking the sugar moiety to the aglycone, is cleaved, it is essential that the glycoside and or the sugar moiety, or portions thereof, be recognizable as a substrate by these bacterial enzymes.It is also essential that the sugar drug combination, i.e. the drug glycoside, be of sufficient size and hydrophilicity to enable the prodrug to pass through the mammalian gastrointestinal tract without being significantly absorbed from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract or without being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host. Although the principle glycosidases produced by the colonic microflora are beta glycosidases, alpha glycosidases are also produced. Thus both alpha and beta glycoses can be utilized as sugar moities in the synthetic drug glycosides disclosed herein. Since the beta glycosidases are the principle colonic microfloral enzymes, beta glycosides are preferred as prodrugs for use in the present colon specific drug delivery system. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that certain alpha glycosides can also be utilized. The sugar moieties on the synthetic prodrugs will preferably be simple natural sugars. Preferred are natural monosaccharide, disaccharide and oligosaccharide hexoses and pentoses. Especially preferred are the natural monosaccharide hexosesD glucose and D galactose and the disaccharideD cellobiose. Since in the present invention the sugar moiety on the prodrug functions as a substrate for the bacterial glycosidases, those skilled in the art will recognize that modifications of these natural sugars are possible as long as the substrate specificity of the parent sugar molecules are preserved. For example, it is possible to substitute sulfur for oxygen on the sugar molecule. Such synthetic derivatives of the natural sugars are within the scope of this invention as long as the substrate specificity of the parent compound remains intact. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the glycone, aglycone and glycosidic linkage can probably all be varied to improve or alter the rate and location of drug release. Such variations fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, the sugar residue could be altered by modifying functional ties See Whitaker, J.R., Principles of Enzymoloay for the Food Sciences, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y. 1972 pp. 434 442 , or an oligosaccharide carrier could be used to hinder the rate of hydrolysis in vivo. Slow hydrolysis of refractory prodrugs in the colon might prove to be an effective mechanism for sustainedrelease. Changing the aglycone, as demonstrated herein, can also alter delivery. Furthermore, the stereochemistry of the glycosidic link might be utilized to vary rates and sites of release.A sustained release system for the small intestine based on certain alpha glycosides could be cleaved by digestive enzymes. Absorption would then be moderated by the rate of release in the small intestine, as well as the physicochemical properties of the parent drug. The present prodrug delivery system is based on use of synthetic drug glycoside prodrug compositions from which active drugs are liberated following hydrolysis of the prodrugs by specific glycosidases produced by intestinal bacteria. Since in man such intestinal bacteria are normally found in the area of the colon See Draser, B.S. and Hile, M.J., HumanIntestinal Flora , Academic Press London 1974 pp.54 71 , use of the present prodrug delivery system will usually result in liberation of active drugs in that area of the intestine. However, those skilled in the art will realize that certain disease states e.g., regional ileitis or Crohn s disease can also cause intestinal bacteria to accumulate in the normally sterile area of the small intestine. The accumulation occurs because, due to swelling and inflammation, ingested materials do not pass as quickly as they normally would through the small intestine. This slowdown in transit time leads to an naccumulationn of ingested material which in turn leads to an accumulation of bacteria that would not otherwise be found in this area of the intestine.In such cases, the present prodrug delivery system can be used to deliver active drugs to the diseased areas of the small intestine since such areas will normally coincide with the areas of the small intestine where the glycosidase producing colonic bacteria are accumulating. It has been shown that the activity of glycosidic enzymes of the colon bacteria can be changed dramatically by diet. For example, in human subjects bean diets result in a large increase in alphagalactosidase activity whereas oat bran diets increase beta glucosidase activity. See Chang, G.W., Fukumoto,H. E. r Gyory, C. P., Block, A. P., Rretsch, M. J. andCalloway, D. H., Fed. Proc. 38 767 1979 Abstract .Since the drug delivery system of the present invention is based on substantially unique glycosidase activities of colonic microflora, and since the levels of the glycosidase enzymes of the colon bacteria can be controlled by simple dietary changes, physicians utilizing the colon specific drug glycoside delivery system disclosed herein will have a further degree of control over their patient s treatment. For example, manipulation of glycosidase activity by diet may be very useful in standardizing glycosidase activity and also in raising enzyme activity in patients with a diseased colon where enzyme levels may be depressed. To form a prodrug to be utilized in the present colon specific drug delivery system, the invention teaches attachment of a sugar residue to the drug aglycone to create a synthetic drug glycoside.These drug glycosides can be synthesized by known chemical methods. See Igarashir R., Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Brochem 34 243 283 1977 . Especially preferred as methods of preparing the drug glycosides disclosed herein are modifications of the Koenigs Knorr reaction.See Meystre, C. and Miescher, K., Helv. Chim. Acta.28 1153 1160 1944 Roenigs, W. and Knorr, E., Ber.34 957 981 1901 and Igarashi, R., Adv. Carbohydr, Chem. Biochem, 34 243 283 1977 . In general, the procedure involves the treatment of a per n acylated glycosyl halide with an alcohol in the presence of a heavy metal salt of an organic base as the acid acceptor. As used herein, the modified methods involve coupling a per n acylated glycosyl halide with an appropriate steroid in chloroform in the presence of silver carbonate as acid acceptor. See FIGURE 1. The acetyl protecting groups on the sugar residues of the drug glycosides are then removed by treatment with bases to yield synthetic drug glycosides. Use of the modified Koenigs Knorr reaction to prepare drug glycosides is illustrated herein with the preparation of glucoside Z and its acetyl precursorPREDTAGLU and glucoside 1 and its acetyl precursorDEXATAGLU . See Example I. As discussed further inExample II, the modified Koenigs Rnorr reaction has also been used to produce a variety of other drug glycosides useful in the drug delivery system of the present invention. These drug glycosides include prednisolone 21 beta D galactoside, 10 dexamethasone21 beta D galactoside, e hydrocortisone 21 beta Dglucoside, 5 hydrocortisone 21 beta D galactoside, ii fludrocortisone 21 beta D glucoside, 7 fludrocortisone 21 beta D galactoside, 12.Example II further illustrates the preparations and use of drug glycosides consisting of a disaccharide coupled to a drug. Such drug glycosides are represented by prednisolone 21 beta D cellobioside, 12. In utilizing the synthetic drug glycosides as prodrugs in the present colon specific drug delivery system, the prodrug is administered orally or intragastrically to the mammalian host. The prodrug is then allowed to pass through the mammalian host s gastrointestinal system. Since the synthetic prodrug is larger and more hydrophilic than the parent drug, the prodrug is less permeable than the parent drug. In addition, since the glycosidic bond linking the glycose to the aglycone is a bond that will be substantially selectively cleaved by glycosidic bacterial enzymes produced by colonic microflora, the synthetic prodrug will pass through the gastrointestinal tract without being significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or without being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host. Once in the area of the colon, the prodrug will be acted upon by bacterial glycosidases, thus releasing free drug for adsorption to or absorption by the colonic mucosa. In a preferred form of the present invention the synthetic prodrugs are comprised of the 21 yl betaD glucosides and galactosides of dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, and fludrocortisone, and the 21 yl beta D cellobioside of prednisolone.Especially preferred is the steroid glycoside dexamethasone 21 beta D glucoside 1 . Synthesis of dexamethasone 21 beta D glucoside, 1, and prednisolone 21 beta D glucoside, X, using a modified Koenigs Knorr reaction, is shown in Example I. In preparing these synthetic drug glycosides, the bromosugar, 2,3,4,6 tetra Q acetyl l bromo alpha D glucopyranose, was coupled with the appropriate steroid in chloroform in the presence of silver carbonate as acid acceptor. Acetyl glycoside products were isolated and then the acetyl protecting groups on the sugar residues of the glycosides removed by treatment with base. The two synthetic drug glycosides were then used in the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed herein. As shown more specifically inExample I, drug glycosides 1 and 2 were administered intragastrically to mammalian rat hosts. Analysis of the hosts intestinal contents and tissues revealed that in this host, both drug glycosides 1 and 2 reached the colon within 4 5 hours, where they were rapidly hydrolyzed.Although delivery of dexamethasone via glycoside 1 appeared to be more specific than that of prednisolone via glycoside O in the rat host, both steroid drugs reached the area of the colon when administered via the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed herein. Nearly 60 of an oral does of glycoside 1 reached the cecum whereas less than 15 of glucoside Z did. In contrast, when the free drug steroids prednisolone and dexamethasone were administered orally, they were absorbed almost exclusively from the small intestine. The influence of prodrug structure on specificity of glycoside glycosidase based colonspecific drug delivery was studied by preparing seven additional steroid glycosides See Example II , measuring their relative lipophilicities See ExampleV and hydrolyzing them with bacterial glycosidases from rat intestines See Examples III and IV .Preparation of compounds 1 and 2 is outlined in Example I. Preparation of the seven additional compounds is outlined in Example II. The nine steroid glycosides are comprised of the 21 yl beta D glucosides and galactosides of dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, and the 21 yl beta D cellobioside of prednisolone. As illustrated in Examples III and IV, the nine deacetylated glycoside prodrugs, along with the p nitrophenyl derivatives of beta D glucoside, galactoside, and cellobioside, were subjected to hydrolysis by the contents of the rat stomach, proximal small intestine PSI , distal small intestine DSI , and cecum. As the data in Example III demonstrate, all the prodrugs were hydrolyzed slowly by PSI and stomach contents, more rapidly by contents of the DSI, and most rapidly by cecal contents.However, the prodrugs themselves had very different susceptibilities to hydrolysis. Hydrolysis rates catalyzed by DSI contents decreased in the following order prednisolone 21 yl beta D galactoside 10 prednisolone 21 yl beta Dglucoside 2 prednisolone 21 yl beta D cellobioside dexamethasone 21 yl beta D galactoside 9 dexamethasone 21 yl beta D glucoside 1 .Hydrolysis of cellobioside II was only half that of glucoside Z and one fourth that of galactoside 10. Hydrolysis of all the prodrugs in cecal contents was rapid, with the exceptions of hydrocortisone 21 yl beta D glucoside O and fludrocortisone 21 yl beta D glucoside 1 , which were hydrolyzed more slowly than the other glucoside prodrugs. Eadie Hofstee plots were used to determine the KM app and VMAX of the reactions. TheEadie Hofstee plots suggested that bacterial beta Dglucosidase activity in the colon may be more heterogeneous in nature than beta D galactosidase activity. See Example IV. Since the physicochemical properties of the prodrug can influence the specificity of the present delivery system and since lipophilicity is very important in determining rates of penetration across biological membranes, gastrointestinal absorption as predicted by octanol buffer partition coefficients was also investigated. More specifically, the relative lipophilicities of the prodrugs and free steroids were compared by measuring their octanol buffer partition coefficients P . Log P of the free steroids ranged from 1.54 to 1.73. Log P of the prodrugs ranged from 0.11 to 0.84, except for the logarithm of the P of cellobioside 1S which was considerably lower 0.56 .See Example IV. Those skilled in the art will realize that the specificity of delivery of a glycoside prodrug to the lower intestine can be estimated from its rate of hydrolysis by DSI contents and its octanol buffer partition coefficient since these parameters limit the amount of prodrug which can survive premature hydrolysis or absorption in the DSI. For example, under the assay conditions used in this study, glucoside 1 supported a specific activity of hydrolysis of 19 nmole min g in DSI contents and had a log P value of 0.59. When this prodrug was administered orally to rats, about half of the dose reached the cecum. Even more effective delivery could be expected of any prodrug which supports less hydrolysis by DSI contents and which has a lower log P value. The data from the in vivo and in vitro tests indicate that use of a disaccharide such as cellobiose, or even a trisaccharide, as the hydrophilic moiety, can produce a prodrug which will be superior in some instances. Such oligosaccharide carriers might be essential if smaller or more lipophilic drugs are to be delivered to the large intestine. In addition, the in vitro data from Examples II IV indicate that the relative rates of hydrolysis, and the relative lipophilicities can be used in conjunction with the in vvo data from Example I to enable one skilled in the art to estimate the site specificity of glycoside prodrugs prior to extensive animal studies. Thus it can be seen that the drug glycosides of the present invention have the property of undergoing bacterial cleavage of their glycosidic bond under conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals. The free drug liberated by such cleavage is absorbable through the colonic mucosa, Based on the arts teaching of the pharmacological efficacy of the free drugs, administration of the drug via the prodrug is thus shown to be possible. Specific embodiments of the present invention are outlined in the following examples. Such examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims in any way. EXAMPLE I The teaching of the present invention makes it possible to construct a variety of synthetic drug glycosides useful in the disclosed colon specific drug delivery system. This example compares the use of two such steroid glycosides, dexamethasone 21 beta Dglucoside, 1 , and prednisolone 21 beta D glucoside, X , in the disclosed colon specific delivery system. Dexamethasone and prednisolone are steroid drugs useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Prodrugs 1 and 2 are the respective drug glycosides of these two steroid compounds. To test the efficacy of 1 and Z in the colon specific drug delivery system disclosed herein, the prodrugs were administered intragastrically to rats. The intestinal contents and tissues were then analyzed to determine where the steroids were released and absorbed. Prednisolone and dexamethasone were also administered to compare the absorption of the drug glucosides with the free steroids. Both drug glucosides 1 and Z were found to reach the colon in 4 5 hr., where they were rapidly hydrolyzed.Delivery of dexamethasone via glucoside 1 to the rat lower intestine appeared to be more specific than that of prednisolone via glucoside 2 60 of an oral dose of glucoside L and 15 of an oral dose of glucoside Z reached the cecum. In contrast, when the free steroids prednisolone and dexamethasone were administered orally, they were absorbed almost exclusively from the small intestine less than 1 of the oral doses reached the cecum. Glucosides 1 and 2 were prepared by glycosylation of dexamethasone and prednisolone using a modified Koenigs Knorr reaction. See Meystre, C. andMiescher, R., Heir. Chim. Acta. 28 1153 1160 1944 and Koenigs, W. and Knorr, E., Ber 34 957 981 1901 .The bromosugar, 2, 3, 4, 6 tetra Q acetyl l bromo alpha D glucopyranose, was coupled with the appropriate steroid in carbon tetrachloride in the presence of silver carbonate as acid acceptor. See FIGURE 1.Acetyl glycoside products were isolated from the reaction mixture by column chromatography on reversed phase C 18 packing material. Yields were 38 for PREDTAGLU, j, and 25 for DEXATAGLU, II. These fair yields are typical for this reaction. SeeIgarashi, K., Adv. Carbohydr. Chem Biochem 34 243 283 1977 . Proton NMR confirmed that the glucosides formed were beta linked. The anomeric proton C 1 exhibited a doublet at 4.20 ppm for PREDTAGLU, lir and 4.18 ppm for DEXATAGLU, IA. The coupling constants were 8 Hz for both compounds. These resonance signals indicate a trans diaxial relationship between the vicinal C l , 21 protons. See Williamson, D.G.,Collins, D.G., Layne, D.S. and Bernstein, S., Biochemrstry 8 4299 4304 1969 . The acetyl protecting groups on the sugar residues of PREDTAGLU, lE, and DEXATAGLU, 1A. were removed by treatment with 0.01 Z sodium hydroxide. The 111 NMR of these compounds again provided evidence of the stereochemistry at their anomeric carbons betalinked . Also, treatment of both glucoside Z and glucoside I with commercial beta glucosidase led to the removal of the glucose moiety in each case. Glucoside Z was hydrolyzed several orders of magnitude faster than was glucoside 1. In addition, incubating these glucosides with homogenized rat feces resulted in extensive hydrolysis of each. Separation of the glycosides from the free steroids was performed by HPTC. A typical chromatogram of the cecal contents of a rat given glucoside 1 intragastrically and sacrificed 6 hr. later is shown inFIGURE 2. Peak A is glucoside I Peak B is dexamethasone, 1 and Peak C is prednisolone, 4, which was added prior to homogenization as an internal standard. The Altex 5 micrometer Ultrasphere, C 18 column was eluted with MeOH 0.01 M KH2P04 56.5 43 5 at a flow rate of 1.2 mL min. The recovery of glucoside 1 and free steroid from the small intestine and cecum at various times following oral administration of glucoside 1 is given in Table I, supra.As the data in the table illustrate, after 3 and 4 h, glucoside 1 was recovered primarily in the lower small intestine. By 5 h, very little of glucoside 1 was observed in either the small intestine or cecum. At the same time, large amounts of steroid X were recovered from the cecum. However, as glucoside 1 passed from the lower small intestine into the cecum, the free drug was released rapidly.The fact that some free steroid was detected in the small intestine at the times tested indicated that some hydrolysis occurred before the prodrug reached the cecum or colon. The recovery of steroid glucosides and free steroids from the intestinal contents and tissues is also shown graphically in FIGURE 3. In that figure, recovery of glucoside 1, DEXAGLU , and dexamethasone 3, DEXA , from rats given 7.5 mg of glucoside 1 at 0 hr are shown in panels A and B. Recovery of glucoside Z PREDGLU and prednisolone A PRED from animals given 7.5 mg of glucoside Z at 0 hr are shown in panelsC and D. Data are given as means SEM n 4 . Solid circle and triangle symbols indicate intestinal contents open circle and triangle symbols indicate intestinal tissues. The results reveal that overall, the delivery of glucoside 1 and subsequent release of steroid 3 in the rat cecum was quite specific. At 4 h, 598 of the administered dose of glucoside 1 was recovered from the lower small intestine contents unhydrolyzed. If all this glucoside passed into the cecum, then nearly 60 of the dose would have been delivered specifically to the cecum. At 5 h, an average of 2.24 mg or an equivalent of 44 of the administered dose was recovered in the cecum as free steroid. The difference 59 vs. 44 was probably due to absorption of free drug by the cecal mucosa following hydrolysis of the prodrug in the cecum. The recovery of glucoside Z and free steroid A from the small intestine and cecum at various times following oral administration of glucoside Z is given in Table II supra. Recovery of glucoside Z after 3 and 4 h from the small intestine was much lower than that for glucoside 1 By 5 h, some free steroid was found in the cecum, however the specificity was quite low.Free steroid 4 was detected in the small intestine at all time points tested, again indicating the presence of glycosidases in the rat small intestine. The recovery of glucoside Z and steroid 4 from the intestinal contents and tissues is shown graphically in panels C and D of FIGURE 2. The results indicate that delivery of glucoside Z was less efficient than that of glucoside 1. Only 14.8 of the administered dose of glucoside Z could be recovered as such from the lower small intestine after 4 h. Therefore, only about 15 of the dose could have been delivered to the cecum. By 5 h, an average of 0.57 mg of steroid 4 or an equivalent of 11 of the administered dose was recovered in the cecum. Again, the difference 14.8 vs. 118 is probably due to absorption of steriod A into the systemic circulation following hydrolysis in the cecum. No glucoside or free steroid was recovered from the colon of those animals tested. This was probably due to slow transit times and the fact that the time points tested following administration did not allow for any released steroid to pass into the rat colon. Transit times in this experiment were slower, but still close to the value of 6.6 0.4 h reported for passage through the alimentary canal of rats fed a stock diet. See Williams, V.J., Senior, W., Aust. G. Biol. Scz. r 35 373 1982 . The specificity of drug release was evaluated further by comparing the difference in free steroid recovered in the small intestine and in the cecum. A paired t test indicated that the preferential release of free steroid ss in the cecum over that in the small intestine was statistically significant t 2.32, p 0.025 . A similar analysis of recoveries of steroid A showed that the preferential release of 4 in the cecum was not quite statistically significant t 1.72, 0.05 p 0.10 . Intestinal transit times varied greatly, and in many cases the administered dose did not reach the cecum by the time of sacrifice. When these animals were excluded from the statistical calculations, the specificity of release is greater for both steroids Z and 4. Measurable amounts of glucoside 1 reached the cecum in eleven of the sixteen animals tested.Analysis of data from only these eleven animals showed that the preferential release of steroid a had high statistical significance t 3.17, p 0.01 . For glucoside i, it was found that the administered dose reached the cecum in eight of sixteen animals tested.Data from these eight animals indicated that the preferential release of steroid A was statistically significant t 3.94, p 0.005 . However, the combined total recoveries of glucoside Z and steroid A at 4 and 5 h was very low. Therefore the efficiency of drug delivery to the cecum was very low, despite the calculated significance. Control experiments in which unmodified steroids 3 and 4 were administered showed that they were absorbed almost completely from the small intestine. These data are shown in FIGURE 4. In that figure, recovery of steroid from animals given 5.25 mg of dexamethasone DEXA , i, is shown in panel A recovery of steroid from animals given 5.10 mg of prednisolone PRED , 4 r is shown in panel B. Data points are means SEM n 3 from intestinal contents, shown as solid circles, and tissues, shown as open circles. The system illustrated in this example is based on the release of anti inflammatory steroids from poorly absorbed steroid glycosides in the rat cecum.Despite the obvious anatomical differences between the laboratory rat and manr the rat cecum can be donsidered to be a satisfactory model for the proximal colon of man. Both organs are recipients of digesta from the small intestine and both are sites of large bacterial populations and extensive microbial activity.Therefore, the term lower intestine is used herein for either the combined rat cecum and colon or the human colon with its poorly defined cecal area. while the rat model is useful, it suffers from the problem of a relatively high bacterial population and a subsequently high level of glycosidase activity that is present in the stomach, upper small intestine, and lower small intestine. For example, there are an average of 107 7, 106.9, and 107 7 7 microorganisms g wet weight in the rat stomach, upper small intestine, and lower small intestine, respectively. In contrastr the bacterial population in man s stomach and small intestine is much lower. There are only an average of 100, 102.6, and 104.2 microorganisms g wet weight residing in the human stomach, upper small intestine, and lower small intestine, respectively. See Drasar,B.S. and Hill, M.J., human Intestinal Flora , AcademicPress London 1974 pp. 54 71, and Hawksworth, G.,Drasar, B.S. and Hill, M.J., J. Med. Microbiol. 4 451 1971 . Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria are the bacterial species comprising the majority of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal system of both the laboratory rat and man. In addition, both species have been shown to produce measurable quantities of beta glucosidase in vivo. See Hawksworth et al., supra. Despite the high level of microbial activity in the rat upper intestine, glucoside 1 showed remarkable specificity towards the lower intestine.This prodrug should be even more specific when used in man because the microbial activity in human stomach and small intestine is much lower than that of the rat.Sulfasalazine, a prodrug used successfully in man, requires activation by colonic microflora. SeePeppercorn, M.A. and Goldman, P., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther.181 55 1972 , and Peppercorn, M.A. and Goldman, P., Gastroenteroloay 64 240 1973 . Sulfasalazine works on much the same principle as does the present glycoside glycosidase delivery system. Therefore, based on the similarities between these two prodrug delivery systems, and the degree of specificity of glucoside 1 demonstrated in the rat model, it is likely that certain drugs can be effectively delivered to the colon of man via glycoside prodrugs. It is worth noting that the relatively poor performance of glucoside Z in the rat model could be due to several factors. Although it is possible that glucoside 2 was absorbed more extensively from the stomach and small intestine than was glucoside L, it was more likely that glucoside Z was hydrolyzed to a greater extent in the stomach and small intestine than was glucoside 1. Commercial beta glucosidase was much more active towards glucoside Z than towards glucoside 1. Similar factors may be functioning in the rat gastrointestinal tract. EXAMPLE II This example illustrates synthesis of seven additional drug glycosides useful in the colon specific drug delivery system of the present invention. Using the modification of the Koenigs Knorr reaction discussed supra, a number of additional drug glycosides have been synthesized. Some of these drug glycosides are listed below. The compounds in parentheses are the protected glycoside products produced in the first step of the modified synthesis.See FIGURE 1. The protecting groups acetyl functions were removed with base to give the glycosides preceding the compounds in parentheses.

Proton NMR spectroscopy of the acetyl glycosides indicated a beta linkage at their anomeric carbons, All the compounds exhibited a doublet at approximately 4.2 ppm for the anomeric proton with coupling constants ranging from 7.2 to 8.0 Hz. These resonance signals indicate a trans diaxial relationship between the C 1 ,2 protons. See Williamson, D.G.,Collins, D.C., Layne, D.S., Conrow, R.B., andBernstein, S., Biochemistry 8 4299 1969 . Removal of the acetyl protecting groups on the sugar residues was accomplished by base catalyzed hydrolysis using 0.01 N NaOH in MeOH. Yields ranged from 60 to 83 for this step. 111 NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the free glycosides were still beta linked. EXAMPLE III Results from the study of the present glycoside glycosidase based delivery system in the laboratory rat indicate that certain anti inflammatory steroids can be delivered to the lower intestine with varying degrees of specificity, depending on the aglycone. To better understand the factors controlling specificity, and to demonstrate the behavior of additional drug glycosides in the mammalian qastrointestinal tract, the kinetics of release of aglycones from three nitrophenyl glycosides and nine tttEoid glycoside prodrugs were measured using freshly prepared homogenates from contents of the rat stomach, proximal small intestine PSI , distal small intestine DSI , and cecum. More specifically, total activities micromoles min and specific activities nmoles min g of native enzymes were first measured in stomach, PSI,DSI, and cecal content homogenates using three p nitrophenyl glycoside substrates. This was accomplished by following the release of 2 nitrophenyl from s nitrophenyl beta D glucoside p NP glc via beta D glucosidase, p nitrophenyl beta D galactoside g NP gal via beta D galactosidase, and p nitrophenyl beta D cellobioside p NP cel via beta Dcellobiosidase and beta D glucosidase. Results of these measurements are shown in Table III.Release of p nitrophenol from all three substrates in all four segments tested indicated the presence of glycosidase activity all along the rat gastrointestinal tract. Total activities of each glycosidase were generally lowest in the stomach and PSI, higher in the DSI, and highest in the cecum. Specific activities of the three glycosidases followed the same general pattern, with highest activities found in the cecum. In addition to the gradient of glycosidase activity along the gastrointestinal tract, there were differences in enzyme levels. Specific activity of cecal beta Dgalactosidase was about four times that of cecal beta D glucosidase, and about sixteen times that of cecal beta D cellobiosidase. Total activities and specific activities for hydrolysis of all nine glycoside prodrugs disclosed inExamples I and II were also measured. Results of those measurements are given in Tables IV glucosides Ir X, 5, 7 and V galactosides i, St, Ifr 12r and cellobioside 13 . The tables are shown supra. Total and specific activities for the hydrolysis of all prodrugs were relatively low in the stomach and PSI contents. They increased in the DSI and were highest in the cecal content homogenates. This pattern follows that found for the hydrolysis of the p NP glycosides however, in all homogenates tested, total and specific activities for hydrolysis of each type of prodrug glucoside, galactoside, and cellobioside were considerably lower than were those of the corresponding D NP glycosides. The data indicate that hydrolysis of all prodrugs was relatively slow when incubated with homogenates of contents from the stomach and PSI, faster in the DSI homogenates, and fastest in the cecum. Loss of prodrugs through hydrolysis in the stomach and PSI is probably negligible. Transit through this portion of the rat gastrointestinal tract is quite rapid transit times can be as low as 40 min. This combination of low enzyme activity and rapid transit in the rat stomach and PSI means that specificity of delivery is probably a function of glycosidase activity and residence time in the DSI.Transit slows considerably in the DSI, increasing the possibility of premature hydrolysis and less specific drug delivery to the rat cecum. Differences in total and specific activities became apparent when each prodrug was incubated with the homogenates of the DSI contents. Dexamethasone prodrugs 1 and 9 were more resistant to hydrolysis than the other prodrugs. Of the two glucosides tested in vivo, glucoside 1 was found to be hydrolyzed about three times slower in the homogenates of the DSI contents than was glucoside 2. As shown in the animal tests included in Example I, glucoside 1 was delivered to the rat lower intestine about four times more specifically than was glucoside Z 59 for 1 and 14 for O . Therefore, there is a rough correlation between total and specific activities in homogenates ofDSI contents, and specificity of delivery observed in vivo.Because the other prodrugs were all hydrolyzed to much greater extent in DSI homogenates, they may not be delivered to the lower intestine as specifically as glucoside 1. All the prodrugs except glucosides S and 1 were hydrolyzed much faster by cecal contents than byDSI contents. The galactosides were hydrolyzed more rapidly by cecal homogenates than were their glucoside counterparts. Thus, any prodrug reaching the cecum following oral administration would be expected to rapidly liberate the pharmacon as desired, with the possible exception of glucosides 5 and 1. However, the galactoside prodrugs would probably release significant amounts of their free steroids in the DSI, prior to reaching the lower intestine. Therefore, the galactoside prodrugs described herein would probably be poor candidates for drug delivery to the rat cecum.It should be noted that the human intestine has a much sharper gradient of bacterial colonization compounds which are not delivered specifically in the rat may be in the human intestine. Furthermore, there may be applications in which it is desirable to deliver a drug to the DSI. When compounds 13, 10 and 2 were incubated inDSI or cecal homogenates, the rate of release of prednisolone 4 from prednisolone cellobioside 1O was much slower than that of steroid A from either glucoside Z or galactoside 10. As a result, delivery of steroid 4, via cellobioside 1S, to the rat cecum would probably still not be as specific as that of dexamethasone 1 , via prodrug I or e. However, the prednisolone glycosides were the most enzymatically labile prodrugs investigated. A cellobioside derivative of any of the other three steroids would probably improve their specificity of delivery.Release of steroid 4 from cellobioside II in the rat cecum would probably be rapid, approximately the same as was observed in vivo for release of steroid 3 from glucoside 1. Slow release of steroid A from cellobioside 13 is probably due to the fact that the rate of hydrolysis by beta D cellobiosidase is slower than the two step hydrolysis by beta D glucosidase. EXAMPLE IV KM app and VMax Determinations. The KM VMax data for hydrolysis of the p nitrophenyl beta D glucoside p NP glc , e nitr ophenyl beta D galactoside EP gal , and the glucoside and galactoside prodrugs are given in TableVI. Eadie Hofstee plots were used to determine the KN app and VMAX of the enzyme reactions. TheEadie Hofstee plots of the relationship V vs V S for hydrolysis of NP glc and NP gal in homogenates of pooled cecal contents from four animals are presented in Figures 5 and 6. At lower substrate concentrations, the plot of the velocity substrate relationship for hydrolysis of NP glc deviated from linearity. Hydrolysis of e NP gal was, however, essentially linear. In calculating the KM and VMax values for hydrolysis of g NP glc, NP gal, and the glucoside and galactoside prodrugs, it was found that the beta D glucosidase activity may be more heterogeneous in nature than beta D galactosidase activity. This was seen in the Eadie Hofstee plots, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, and may reflect the production of different beta D glucosidases by the many bacterial species living in the large intestine. EXAMPLE V Partition coefficients, often measured between n octanol and an aqueous phase, have proved very useful in correlating lipophilicity with absorption patterns of compounds absorbed by passive diffusion from the gastrointestinal tract. See Leo, A., Hansch, C., andElkins, D., Chem. Rev. 71 525 1971 . Therefore, partition coefficients of the prodrugs and the free steroids were measured. More specifically, the apparent n octanol buffer 0.01 X phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 partition coefficients P were measured at 370C. The results of these measurements, expressed as log P, are given in Table VII. Cellobioside 1S had the lowest logP 0.56 of any of the prodrugs tested. The galactoside prodrugs all had lower log P values than the corresponding glucoside prodrugs. As expected, the log P values for the free steroids were much greater than those of the glycosides. The effect of incorporating a hydrophilic moiety i.e., glucose into dexamethasone is shown inExample I. More specifically, the data contained therein show that following oral administratidn of a glucose dexamethasone drug glycoside glucoside 1 , 78 of the dose was recovered intact from the animals intestinal lumen 3 h later in contrast, only 3.98 of an oral dose of steroid i was recovered 3 h later. Thus, attaching a hydrophilic glucose moiety to steroid 1 drastically impeded its absorption. This is reflected in the difference in partition coefficients log P of glucoside 1 0.59 and steroid X 1.72 .Because the log P of glucoside Z was even lower than that of glucoside ir it appears that the poorer specificity of delivery of glucoside Z in the rat model was due primarily to premature release of the drug in the upper intestine rather than absorption from the gastrointestinal lumen prior to reaching the cecum.

The foregoing description and accompanying examples demonstrate the efficacy of a colon specific drug delivery system based on the use of a synthetic drug glycoside prodrug composition which, when ingested by a mammal, undergoes reaction with colonic microflora to release a free drug capable of being adsorbed to or absorded by the colonic mucosa. The present drug delivery system combines the convenience of oral administration with the specificity of topical application.It is especially useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The invention also provides a method of making a colon specific prodrug comprising forming a glycosidic link between a sugar,and an aglycone wherein said sugar is a sugar recognizable as a susbtrate by bacterial glycosidases produced by colonic microflora and said glycosidic link is a glycosidic link capable of being cleaved by the glycosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora following recognition of said sugar as a substrate by said bacterial glycosidases, and said aglycone is a drug such that the resulting glycoside is of sufficient size and hydrophilicity to allow it to pass through the mammalian gastrointestinal tract without being significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or without being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host so that said prodrug can reach the area of the mammalian colon where said glycosidic link can be cleaved by said bacterial glycosidases to release free drug to the area of the colon. Further included in the invention is a prodrug formulation comprising a prodrug of the invention or a glycoside of the invention, in either case formulated for pharmaceutical or veterinary use. Such formulation will be in accordance with standard practice in the art, e.g. the use of the appropriate unit dosage forms. The invention further provides a method of making a glycoside which comprises forming a glycosidic link between a sugar and an aglycone wherein said sugar is a sugar recognizable as a substrate by bacterial glycosidases produced by colonic microflora and said glycosidic link is a glycosidic link capable of being cleaved by the glycosidase enzymatic activity of colonic microflora following recognition of said sugar as a substrate by said bacterial glycosidases, and said aglycone and sugar are chosen such that the resulting glycoside is not capable of being significantly hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes produced by the mammalian host but is capable of passing substantially unabsorbed through the gastrointestinal tract to reach the colon. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Such modifications fall within the scope of the inventive concept.
