# A method for recovering useful products from waste products obtained when manufacturing aluminium fluoride.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for recovering useable products from waste products deriving from the manufac ture of aluminium fluoride on the basis of aluminium hydroxide and fluosilicic acid. Mother liquors and washing water from a scrubber in said process, which solutions contain aluminium, silica, fluorine, and phosphorous is reacted in a first step with sodium ions at pH 2 3, and a temperature of 50 100 C to give a precipitate of sodium fluoroaluminate, which is isolated. The filtrate from said first step can be reacted with the silica waste product obtained in the above mentioned aluminium fluoride manufacture.
