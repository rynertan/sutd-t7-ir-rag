## Description
This invention relates to a badge card or vend ticket marking machine, and to a badge card or vend ticket to be used therewith. As is knonvnS increasingly more services and facilities utilize a badge card or vend ticket system. Badge card, or vend ticket, defines a document which is sold or otherwise granted to the user autnorizing the latter to avail him herself reiterEtively of a certain service, or of a given type of facility, each utilization or consumption involving the expenditure of a certain number of marks from the card or ticket. Basic requisites of a badge card or vend ticket are that it must be identifiable by automatic machines enabled to mark, or obliterate, a given number of marks corresponding to the service sought, capable of being checked visually even by the user him herself for the marks expended, and be wear and tear resisting. Cards or tickets of that general type have been in use for some time and comprise in general a piece of cardboard or the like material, provided, for instance, with suitable blocks or spaces, practically corresponding to as many marks of the card, which are then punched or otherwise invalidated each time that the user utilizes the intended service or facility. That approach, albeit a practical one, has the serious drawback of being easily deceited, and that it cannot be easily and reliably identified by the marking machine. In an attempt at eliminating the above problem, badge cards or vend tickets have been introduced which incorporate a magnetic zone, wherein a code or identifying information can be easily included, the magnetic zone also including the expendible marks.The latter form, while much better safeguarded against counterfeiting and a deceitful use of the card, has the serious fault that it is mechanically delicate11, in that any folds or small local damage can result in the marking machines being unable to identify it.Moreover, since the information and marks are provided in the magnetic sone, incidental or intentional cancellation of the information and marks becomes a possibility where the card or ticket is placed close to a permanent magnet or other source of a magnetic field. Further knows solutions also fail to be entirely satisfactory, both as regards their checking by the automatic marking machines and their ability to be readily identifiable and carry a plurality of items of information as may be required for future computations. This invention sets out to eliminate the drawbacks mentioned hereinabove by providing a badge card or vend ticket which is easily and unmistakably indetifiable by automatic marking machines, and which can be readily utilized even in the presence of local deterioration and cannot be practically counterfeited. The invention is further directed to providing a marking machine for use with the above card or ticket, which is enabled to mark, or obliterate, the marks corresponding to a given service such that the user can easily check the number of marks used up, and accordingly of the marks still left available. Within the above general aims, it is further possible to arrange that the badge card or vend ticket according to the invention is exceptionally impervious to the action of water, snow, low temperature and mishandling by its user, still retaining its integrity or usability. It is further possible to arrange that the badge card or vend ticket according to this invention, while being of quite a compact size, can contain a high number of information items in addition to a conveniently high number of usable marks. It is further possible to arrange that the marking or obliterating machine according to the invention is extremely reliable in operations to ensure troublefree and consistent perform Ace. It is further possible to arrange that both the marking or obliterating machine, as well as the badge card or vend ticket, according to this invention, can be easily formed from readily available components, and are relatively inexpensive to manufacture, such as to be competitive with conventional apparata. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a marking or obliterating machine for badge cards or vend tickets, characterized in that it comprises card positioning and locking means actuated by the introduction of said card, means for reading said card and actuated by a first motor, and marking or obliterating means effective to destroy the first mark in the set of marks corresponding to the service utilized and actuated by a second motor controlled by said card or ticket reading means. Further features and advantages will be more clearly apparent from the description of a preferred, but not limitative, embodiment of a badge card or vend ticket marking machine, as well as of the badge card or vend ticket to be used therewith, as illustrated by way of example only in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 shows schematically a badge card or vend ticket according to the invention Figure 2 shows, to an enlarged scale, a detail of the groove formed in the badge card or vend ticket Figure 3 shows schematically the cyclic sequence representing the card or ticket marks Figure 4 is a schematical plan view, partly in section, of the present marking machine Figure 5 is a sectional view taken along the line V V of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a sectional view taken along the lineVI VI of Figure 4 and Figure 7 illustrates, to an enlarged scale, the badge or ticket reading means. With reference to the cited drawing figures, the badge card or vend ticket according to this invention comprises a plate like element 1 having, of preference, a rectangular shape with three rounded corners and a fourth corner, indicated at 2, which stands out more s such Ã…as to function as a locating element for accurately positioning the badge card or vend ticket. The plate like element I which makes up the badge card is preferably formed from a plastics material, edge of the same type as that normally used in record manufacturing moreover, the plate like element 1 has a much reduced thickness, for example of approximately 0.2 mm. Along the longitudinal centerline of the platelike element 1, there is provided a first through hole 3 and a second through hole 4, which holes, as will be apparent hereinafter, have the function of permitting the card 1 to be positioned and locked also provided is a third through hole 5 at an edge, the function whereof is simply that of allowing the card or ticket 1 to be tied to a string or similar element. Concentrically with the first hole 3, there is provided a circular groove 6 comprising at least a first zone, schematically indicated at 6a, wherein the card identification data are provided as well as any other useful item of information, and a second zone, indicated at 6b, wherein symbols are provided which are representative of the marks proper. ore specifically, and as shown in Figures 2 and 3, a start up point is provided, as indicated at 7, which represents the starting point in reading the card, alongside which there extends the zone 6a which carries card identification information, the marks being encoded in cyclic sequences, as shown in detail in Figure 3 by way of example only, it is possible to arrange in the cited groove forty identification bits and two hundred mark bits grouped as two per mark, i.e. in practice to produce a card or ticket with a one hundred mark capacity. The badge card or vend ticket has the important advantage that it cannot be counterfeited because, as mentioned, the marks are represented thereon in cyclic sequences, namely the groove exhibits a given pattern for each mark which corresponds to a logic code identifiable by the machine, and because , as mentioned, the plate like element 1 is formed from a plastics material and cannot be easily altered or damaged, local damage being insufficient to result in void reading of the card or ticket, by virtue of the marks being arranged in a cyclic sequence, thereby they can be read by the marking or obliterating machine even if the card happens to be damaged locally. With reference to Figures 4 to 7, there is shown the marking or obliterating machine for accepting the type of badge card or vend ticket just described. The marking or obliterating machine comprises an outer frame, generally indicated at. 10, which is formed with a slot 11 for the introduction of the card or ticket 1 therein, said slot being preferably provided with a lead in mouth Ila downstream whereof a pair of brushes 12 are provided which have the function of removing dust and impurities which may deposit on the card 1. At the slot 11, a detent surface is provided, as indicated at 13, on which the card or ticket l is caused to rest after being introduced into the marking or obliterating machine. The marking or obliterating machine further comprises means for positioning and locking the card or ticket 1, which are actuated directly by the introduction of the card or ticket into the machine.Said locating means comprise a detector 20 arranged on the detent surface 13 and being adapted to be actuated by the cited corner 2 of the card 1 which is an indication that the card 1 has been correctly inserted. The cited detector 20 controls a bistable solenoid 21 which drives a rocker arm element 22 carrying at its free end a first locating pin 23 intended for penetrating said first hole 3 in the card 1. Moreover, to said rocker arm element 22, there is connected an arm 24 which carries a second locating pin 25 adapted for insertion through the second hole 4. said first pin 23 passes, with its lower free end, through a small disk 26 which serves as a detent element with respect to the surface 13. The disk 26 has a diameter equal to the transversal dimension of the card or ticket, and serves the function of allowing a pre determined space for the card. For constructional reasons, the disk will rotate along with the first pin 23. The marking or obliterating machine further comprises means for reading the card or ticket 1, which comprise a head 30 having a needle 31 engage able in the groove 6, the needle being supported, in a manner which will be explained hereinafter, in lower brackets 32a and upper brackets 32b which are cantilever connected to the pin 23 and project outwardly in a radial direction. Klre specifically, the head 30 is carried by a block 33, which is hinged at 34 to the lower bracket 32a and has at the top a sloping lug 35 adapted for engagement through a slot 36 formed in the upper bracket 32b the sloping lug 35, in engaging the bracket 32b, acts as a speed limiter during the final stage of the downward movement and limits the extent to which the block 33 can oscillate, the block being in turn connected through a coil spring 37 to the lower bracket 32a, thereby an elastic pressure is applied at all times which keeps the needle 31 in close contact with the groove 6. Mhen the card is not inserted, and the first pin 23 is accordingly in its raised position, the needle is prevented from dropping downwards since the rotation of the block 33 is hindered by the lug 35 engaging in the slot 36. Also provided is a first stepping motor 38, whereto a pinion gear 39a is keyed which meshes with a gear wheel 39b keyed to the pin 23 which has the function of rotating the pin 23 and consequently the head 30 to effect the reading. It should be noted that the pinion gear 39a has a greater axial height than the gear wheel 39b, such as to remain in mesh engagement regardless of the displacement of the pin 23. The marking or obliterating machine also includes obliterating means which are operative to destroy a pertinent mark in the groove 6, and more precisely, as will be explained hereinafter, the first mark the set of marks corresponding to the service utilized. Such obliterating means comprise a pusher sleeve 40 which is carried by Caid brackets 32a and 32b for sliding movement along a direction substantially parallel to the axis of the pin 23 moreover, on the outer surface of the pusher sleeve 40, there is provided a small ring 41, whereon a lift spring 42 is active which acts with its other end against the lower bracket 32a and has the function of keeping the pusher sleeve 40 slightly raised off the card 1 in the non obliterating condition. Inside the pusher sleeve 40, punch 50 is provided for sliding movement therein, which has its lower end at a lower edge 51 on the pusher sleeve 40 serving the function of abutting against the card 1 during the obliteration to prevent the upsetting of the card, that is the stretching of the plastic material during the obliteration step, as explained hereinafter. Said punch 50 is driven out, of the top of the pusher sleeve 40, an elastic pad 52 being interposed, which is adjusted to have a high force value, between the top end of the sleeve 40 and the head 53 of the punch 50. The head 53 of the punch 50 urges in contact relationship a pusher table 60 the downward stroke whereof, to apply a pressure action on the punch 50, is accomplished through ball bearings 61 carried rotatively by the pusher table 60, which engage with shafts 62 rotatively supported in the frame 10 and driven rotatively by drives, generally indicated at 63, powered by a DC motor 64.At the engagement area between the shafts 62 and bearings 61, notches 65 are provided in scroll like configuration which are formed on the shaft 62 such that at that contact point the shaft is practically in the form of a camming element, thereby when the bearings 61 are located inside the notches, the table 60 is in a raised position, whereas when they engage with the remaining portion of the shaft, the table is urged do wnwardly0 Furthermore, a return spring 70 is provided which acts. on the lower or bottom face of the table 60, a detent 71 being arranged on an embossment rigid with the pin 23. The downward stroke of the table 60, which occurs upon the motor 64 receives the consent to obliteration from the reading means, produces a pressure or pushing action on the head 53, and as a first result the punch 50 is caused to move downwards together with the pusher sleeve 40 against the elastic resistance of the spring 42 as the table 60 continues to move downwards, the elastic resistance of the pad 52 is overcome, thereby a sliding movement occurs between the punch 50 and pusher sleeve 40, which is pressed onto the card 1 to prevent it from being upset, whilst the punch 50 moves out to destroy the mark, an operation which consists in practice in forming a crosswise groove 7a on the groove 6, thus obliterating the mark the groove practically forms a readable mark, as gainst a generical obliteration of the groove 6. The operation of the marking or obliterating machine according to the invention is the following.Upon insertion of a badge card or vend ticket 1, the bistable solenoid 21 is initially activated through the sensor 20, which causes the first and second pins 23 and 24 to be lowered and hold the card 1 in position, In the event that the card 1 fails to be correctly positioned, the pins 23 and 25 are not lowered and the machine operation is interrupted. After the pins 23 and 25 have been lowered, thereby the card 1 is correctly positioned, the reading means are activated, the reading means being pre arranged such that the reading always starts from the foremost point, so that the zone 6a as read first which contains the items of information, thereafter the zone 6b is read continuously until the needle 31 reaches an already obliterated mark upon reaching an already obliterated mark, the equipment of the reading head 30 is rotated through as many positions as are the marks which must be invalidated for the specific service utilized, as well as through the distance separating the needle 31 from the punch 50. In other words, the reading is practically effected in a forward direction from the identification, whereas the cancellation is effected in a rearward direction. After the rotary equipment has brought the punch to the mark to be obliterated, which mark will correspond in practice to the first mark in the set of marks required for a particular service to be utilized, the motor 64 is energized. The energization of the motor 64 causes, as mentioned already, the table 60 to be lowered, with accompanying downward movement, first of the pusher sleeve 40, and subsequently of the punch 50, which by squeezing the card 1, produces a deviation of the groove, thus practically invalidating the mark. Thus, it will be appreciated that, since the reading head continues its reading action til it reaches an obliterated mark, that is an area of the groove 6 whereat a squeezing action has been applied, it will be sufficient to invalidate a single mark corresponding to the set of marks required by that given service, because the reading is not carried on beyond one obliteration. It will be apparent from the foregoing that the invention achieves its objects, and particularly the fact is emphasized that the badge card 1 just described is extremely convenient to use, it being formed from a plastics material having excellent mechanical strength properties, and since the groove which corresponds to the system information as well as to the marks is engraved, it is not possible to incidentally cancel it, as is the case with magnetic cards, and on account of the marks and information being encoded in a cyclic sequence, the groove cannot be altered deceitfully. It should be added to the foregoing that the obliterated region, i.e. the squeezed mark, is readily visible to the user, who is thus enabled to check at any time exactly how many marks he she has left on the card. Moreover, it will be possible to imprint the card or ticket with as many items of information as are required, because the latter do not interfere in any way with the automatic card reading means. The invention as described is susceptible to many variations and modifications, within the purview of the instant inventive concept. I Furthermore, all of the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. In practicing the invention, the materials employed, as well as the shapes and dimensions, may be any ones to suit contingent requirements.
