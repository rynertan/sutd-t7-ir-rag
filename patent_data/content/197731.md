# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR THICKENING PULP AND PAPER STOCK

## Abstract
Apparatus for thickening a suspension of paper making pulp in water employs a pair of endless perforate belts 30, 31 , referred to as wires since they are like paper machine forming wires one inside the other which at the inlet end of the apparatus are trained around two spaced rolls 23, 25 from which they converge to wrap a third rill 20 and thereby define a generally V shaped horizontally extending space into which the stock to be thickened is delivered by a headbox 50 positioned between the two wires. The result ing sandwich of wire pulp wire is then caused to wrap the major portion of the third roll 20 so that it reverses its direction and then travels around additional rolls 33, 23 until it completes the major part of a loop, during which travel, drainage through the outside wire 31 takes place. When the sandwich reaches this position, the wires separate, pass in diverging relation above and below a trough 60 in which the thickened pulp is collected, above and below the headbox 50 , and then reconverge to continue the opera tion.
