# Ingot casting method.

## Abstract
Molten aluminum, magnesium, or their alloys, or other metal is solidified in a mold 18 or casting device from which an ingot 22 is continuously and progressively withdrawn. The ingot 22 is initially formed has a solid shell 20 and a liquid core 30 which progressively solidifies as the ingot is withdrawn through and from the casting device. As the ingot emerges from the casting device it is contacted directly with water or other coolant 39 referred to as direct chill. Improved casting rates can be achieved without cracking the ingot where the direct chill cooling effects are divided into three successive zones. In the first direct chill zone 50 a relatively high chill rate is employed, after which a retarded chill rate is employed in a second direct chill zone 60 followed by a higher chill rate in a third direct chill zone 70 . Thus, the ingot is drawn through a high direct chill rate zone then a lower direct chill rate zone and then a higher direct chill rate zone. The intermediate low chill rate zone is effected preferably by use of a dissolved gas such as carbon dioxide, which establishes a heat insulating film or layer 61 around the solidifying ingot to retard heat extraction. At a predetermined distance from the mold that film is then mechanically disturbed as by a comb, rake or other mecha nical action or as by a jet of water, air or other fluid 74 to establish a higher chill rate for the third zone.
