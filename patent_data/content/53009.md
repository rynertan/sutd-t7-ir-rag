# A LOAD LIFTING ATTACHMENT FOR USE WITH A FORK LIFT TRUCK, HOIST, CRANE OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
This invention relates to a load lifting attachment serving as a jib for use with fork lift trucks. Existing attachments are either intended to replace the forks of a truck or involve sliding a jib on to the forks. The drawbacks of both known arrangements are that they are heavy, cumbersome and expensive. These drawbacks are eliminated by the present invention that provides an attachment comprising a member adapted to each end to be engaged with a fork of a truck and fitted between said ends with a swivel hook that can be engaged with a hoist or crane or have a load suspended therefrom, each end of said member being provided with a shackle to which lifting ropes, chains or the like can be engaged and the load evenly spread, balanced and con trolled.
