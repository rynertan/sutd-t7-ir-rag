# TUMBLE DRYING MACHINES

## Abstract
In a tumble dryer machine, a motor 7 which drives the drum 5 and circulating fan 6 continues to operate at the end of a drying cycle, but with the air heater 4 cut out, until the exhaust air temperature sensed at 16 reduces to a predeter mined level. The time during which the heater 4 is in opera tion can thus be reduced. A heat exchanger 2 serves to preheat the incoming air with the exhaust air.
