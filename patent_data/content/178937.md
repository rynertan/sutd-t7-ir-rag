## Description
This invention relate to a liquid crystalline composition suitable as a material for use in field effect mode liquid crystal display elements, particularly display elements according to the high level multiplexing driving method. Liquid crystal display elements have long been used in digital watches and portable electronic calculators, and recently their application has been expanded to display devices of larger sizes capable of displaying more information, such as portable computers, portable television sets, and various measuring instruments for office use. One driving method meeting such a need is a multiplexing driving method based on a voltage averaging technique, and liquid crystal display elements adapted for operation by the high time division multiplex driving method are now on the market. Consequently, liquid crystalline compositions suitable for the high level multiplexing driving method are desired, but many of the conventional compositions do not conform to this driving method. JP A 58 191780 describes a nematic liquid crystal composition containing a compound of the formula I wherein R and R are each straight chain C₁ C₈ alkyl and a liquid crystal compound having positive dielectric anisotropy expressed by formula II, III, IV or V wherein R is as defined in respect of I and X is halogen . This composition can be used with a liquid crystal compound having negative or almost zero dielectric anisotropy, such as a compound of formula VI wherein A and R are as defined in respect of I . FR A 2184512 describes a nematic liquid crystal compound of the formula wherein R is alkyl , which may be used in conjunction with a compound of formula wherein R₁ and R₂ are organic groups such as C The characteristics generally required of a liquid crystalline composition used in display elements are, for example, as follows. In performing high level multiplexing driving, the characteristic 5 is particularly important. This will be explained at some length below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a top plan view of a dot matrix display element for explaining the multiplexing driving method Figure 2 is a diagram showing the relation between the operation margin of a liquid crystal display element and the number of lines scanned by multiplexing drive and Figure 3 is a diagram showing the relation between the luminance of a liquid crystal display element and an effective voltage applied. As shown in Figure 1, electrodes Y₁, Y₂, Y₃.....Y Figure 2 shows the relation between the number N of lines scanned by multiplexing drive and the operation margin α . It is seen from this diagram that with increasing N, α approaches 1. In other words, in the high time division multiplex driving method, the difference between the voltage of an on point and that of an off point becomes extremely small. The general voltage luminance characteristics of liquid crystals in the field effect mode display are shown by the curve in Figure 3. To obtain good display by the time division multiplex driving method, it is necessary that the effective voltage V As another problem, an interference color of light sometimes appears on a display surface in a liquid cell filled with a liquid crystalline composition having a small optical anisotropy Δn. This may be prevented, for example, by increasing the cell gap the thickness of the liquid crystalline layer , or by adding another type of liquid crystals having large Δn and thus increasing the Δn of the composition as a whole. Such methods sometimes may adversely affect response and multiplexing driving characteristics. It is an object of this invention to provide a liquid crystalline composition having the aforesaid characteristics 1 to 4 and particularly the sharp voltage luminance characteristics 5 above. Another object of this invention is to provide a liquid crystalline composition which has a large optical anisotropy and when filled in a cell, does not permit formation of an interference color of light on a display surface. These objects are achieved in accordance with this invention by a nematic liquid crystalline composition to be referred to as the liquid crystalline composition I comprising of As a further improved liquid crystalline composition, the present invention provides a nematic liquid crystalline composition to be referred to as the liquid crystalline composition II comprising a compound to be referred to as the compound 5 represented by the general formula as an essential ingredient in addition to the essential ingredients. i.e. the compounds 1 , 2 , and 3 or and 4 , of the liquid crystalline composition I . The liquid crystalline compositions I and II of this invention may include other nematic liquid crystalline compounds in addition to the compounds 1 to 5 in amounts which do not impair the objects of this invention in order to control the threshold voltage, the liquid crystalline temperature range, the viscosity, etc. so as to conform to various requirements such as driving voltages, driving temperature ranges and the speed of response. The following compounds of general formulae 6 to 15 may be cited as typical examples of the other nematic liquid crystalline compounds suitable for use in this invention. In these formulae 6 to 15 , R and R each represent a linear alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The preferred proportions of the ingredients constituting the liquid crystalline compositions of this invention are 10 to 45 for compound 1 , 20 to 55 for compound 2 , 5 to 35 for compounds 3 and 4 combined, and 0 to 25 for the other nematic liquid crystalline compound in the liquid crystalline composition I and 15 to 40 for compound 1 , 5 to 40 for compound 2 , 5 to 30 for compound 5 , 5 to 40 for compounds 3 and 4 combined, and 0 to 20 for the other nematic liquid crystalline compound in the liquid crystalline composition II . The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. For comparison, a phenylcyclohexane type liquid crystalline composition widely used as a low viscosity liquid crystalline composition Comparative Example 1 , and a biphenyl type liquid crystalline composition widely used as a liquid crystalline composition having a large refractive index anisotropy Comparative Example 2 are used. These two comparative liquid crystalline compositions are suitable for use in 1 2 1 4 duty multiplexing driving display the number of lines scanned 2 4 . The abbreviations used in the following tables have the following meanings. Each of the liquid crystalline composition in the above Examples and Comparative Examples was filled in three display cells having different cell gaps. In each cell the threshold effective voltage V The results are shown in Table 3. In the table, d represents the cell gap. The foregoing results clearly demonstrate that the liquid crystalline compositions of this invention are markedly improved over the comparative liquid crystalline compositions in gamma characteristics which are essential to high level multiplexing driving, and that the liquid crystalline compositions of this invention have optical anisotropy sufficient for preventing the formation of a light interference color. Since the liquid crystalline compositions of this invention have sharp voltage luminance characteristics as described hereinabove in detail, they have excellent operability in a high level multiplexing driving system, and do not permit formation of an interference color of light on a display surface.
