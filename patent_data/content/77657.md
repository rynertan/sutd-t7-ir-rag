# APPARATUS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CONFIGURATION OF AN INPUT OUTPUT DIGITAL CIRCUIT AMONG DIFFERENT INPUT OUTPUT PROTOCOLS

## Abstract
An interface circum coupled to a computer operating system through a local input output bus is selectively configurable into one of two circuit configurations for communicating with an external user in one of two corres ponding different protocols. The configuration of the inter face circuit is selected by using a switching assembly to select between two sets of input output buffer circuits, wherein each set is configured to communicate in a different protocol. In one embodiment, the switch assembly is comprised of a plurality of manually manipulated plug and socket combinations.
