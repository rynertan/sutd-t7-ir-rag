## Description
CONTROL OF REAL TIME PROCESSES This invention relates to the control of, and means for controlling, in real time the course of an industrial process, or any other form of controllable activity. In what follows, the totality of apparatus including the means for exercising such control for performing the process or activity will be referred to as the system. In carrying on such a process or activity, the system proceeds in real tine from one specific, defined operating condition or state in which it is ready for any relevant and necessary next control action to be initiated, to a next such operating state, which next state will be achieved, consequent upon the initiation of a said control action, or upon the occurrence of some other disturbance in the system, only after the occurrence of a defined change or increment in the operating mode of the system. A means hereinafter referred to as the controller for exercising control of such a process or activity must therefore include means for discerning the attainment of each such next state, and for this purpose said controller must be kept informed of variations in all of the system parameters that influence, or are influenced by, the course of said process. Hence, the system must also include feedback means for feeding back to said controller data representing the values of all said parameters. Moreover, a said controller has inherently within itself, i.e. by virtue of its present condition, some inforzintion concerning the immediate past history of the process, which information can be used by the controller in determining in conjunction with said feedback data a future course of action for further advancing the process in a desired manner. For simplicitys sake, in what follows a each said defined operating condition or state will be referred to as a SYSTEM STATE, or more simply as aSTATE and b each said defined change or increment in the operating mode of the system will be referred to as an OPERATING MODE INCREMENT , or OMI. Thus, each system state can be represented in terms of the preceding system state and the conjunctive operating mode increment that differentiates such system state over said preceding system state. For any system as aforesaid, the operation of the system can be fully represented as a network of system states linked by associated operating mode increments. In what follows, all of the possible system states for a given system will be referred to as constituting a SET OF STATES for the system. Such a set of states can be represented in a STATE DIAGRAM for the system, as will be shown and described later. At any given time, such a system can exist in any one and one only state of its set of states, and since each such state is either existent or non existent and can therefore be represented by the alternative logical talus TRUE or FALSE for any such system, at any given time only one such STATE in the set can be represented by the logical value TRUE, all the other states of the set being represented by the logical valueFALSE. likewise, an operating mode increment that distinguishes one state from the next has either been achieved, or not achieved, so that that operating mode increment can likewise be represented by the alternative logical values TRUE and FALSE. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of, or apparatus for, controlling or simulating a process, in which method or apparatus a all possible states of the process that are separately identifiable are each represented by a corresponding logical variable of a set of such variables, which set has the property that one, and only one, member of the set may take the value TRUE at any one time , all others inherently then having the value FALSE b the operation of the process is represented by maintaining a correspondence between said separately identifiable states of the process and the logical values of the corresponding members of said set and c said correspondence is maintained by detecting the required conditions appertaining to the change of state of the process from a given first state to a given next state and accordingly setting the said variable representing the said next state to take the value TRUE, whereupon the variable representing said first state will inherently take the value FALSE. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention said process is controlled or simulated by a digital processor in which the process is defined by a set of P statements of the form STATE N and OMI N,N l STATE N l where N may have any integral value up to P, STATE N and STATE N l are each members of a set of P logical variables of which set one and only one member may take the value TRUE at any given time, and OMI N,N l is the Operating Mode Increment also a logical variable which is set to the value TRUE if the conditions which indicate that the process has proceeded from STATE N to a next STATE N l are detected. Said property of said set of logical variables is preferably realised by a storing the identity of theSTATE most recently found to have the value TRUE, b evaluating any STATE in the set by making a comparison of the identity of said STATE with the identity stored, and c allocating the value TRUE to said STATE if the two identities are the same, but theFALSE value otherwise. The identity of each STATE is advantageously represented by an address in an hypothetical storage unit in which every member of said set is deemed to be stored. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided in or for a said system of which the operation can be defined by a SET of P logical statements of the form STATE N OMI N,N 1 STATE N,N l N l where N may have any integral value up to P, STATE N N,N 1 and STATE N 1 are all logical variables i.e. two state variables , and OMI N is the conjunctive OPERATING MODE INCREMENT that is necessary to the progress of the system from STATE N to STATE N 1 , and in which SET only one such STATE N variable at a time can be recognised as having the value TRUE, a control apparatus which comprises i storage leans for storing the identity of the STATE currently having i.e. most recently found to have the logical value TRUE ii feedback means, for feeding back current value data relating to various relevant parameters of the process iii STATE evaluating means, for evaluating in turn each successive STATE in at least a group of such STATES in said SET on the basis of said feedback data and said stored TRUE STATE identity, by a determining the logical value of the preceding STATE or STATES on which said STATE is dependent, b determining the logical value of the or each OPERATING MODE INCREMENT on which said STATE is dependent, and c evaluating the logical statement defining said STATE, using the logical values just determined for the or each preceding STATE and the associated OPERATING MODE INCREMENT, to determine the logical value of said STATE iv updating means, for storing in place of said stored STATE identity, the identity of a STATE just found in c above to have the logical value TRUE and v control action initiating means, for initiating any relevant and necessary control action on finding in c above a STATE having the logical value TRUE. Said STATE evaluating means is preferably arranged to determine the logical value of the or each preceding STATE on which said STATE is dependent by making a comparison of the identity of each such preceding STATE with the identity of the STATE stored in said storage means, said logical value being TRUE only when the compared identities are the sue. Advantageously, said identity of each STATE is represented by the address in a storage unit of the storage location therein in which the actual identity of said STATE in said SET is stored. Since in practice it is unnecessary for said comparison purposes to use said actual identity of a STATE, said storage location may conveniently and with substantial advantage comprise simply an hypothetical storage location, allocated to said STATE, in an hypothetical storage unit, or in an hypothetical extension of a storage unit used for the ordinary data processing functions of the apparatus. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of controlling a system, as hereinbefore defined, of which the operation can be defined by the aforementioned SET of P logical statements, which method comprises the steps of i storing the identity of the STATE currently having i.e. most recently found to have the logical value TRUE ii evaluating in turn each successive STATE in at least a group of such STATES in said SET on the basis of feedback data relating to current values of various relevant parameters of the process and said stored TRUE STATE identity, by a determining the logical value of the preceding STATE or STATES on which said STATE is dependent, b determining the logical value of the or each OPERATING MODE INCREMENT on which said STATE is dependent, and c evaluating the logical statement defining said STATE, using the logical values just determined for the or each preceding STATE and the associated OPERATING MODE INCREMENT to determine the logical value of said STATE iii storing in place of said stored STATE identity the identity of a STATE just found in c above to have the logical value TRUE and iv initiating any relevant and necessary control action on finding a STATE having the logical value TRUE. Preferably, said step ii a is performed by making a comparison of the identity of each such preceding STATE with the identity of the stored STATE identity. Advantageously, the identity of the STATE currently having the TRUE value is stored in a dedicated storage location connected with one input circuit of a comparator that storage location is activated simultaneously with the supply to a second input circuit of said comparator of the identity of a STATE currently being determined in said step ii a and the comparator supplies a TRUE or FALSE output signal according to the state of equality or inequality of the compared STATE identities, thereby indicating the logical value of the STATE currently being determined. The present invention greatly facilitates the efficient and expeditious execution of control programs for real time processes this is particularly significant when such processes are being controlled by means of wicro processors. The methods and apparatuses of the present invention may also be used in the simulation of various processes and activities of the various kinds referred to in this Specification. Other features and advantages of the present invention will appear from the following description, and from the claims appended at the end of that description. One electric control system embodying the present invention, for controlling the operation of a coal fired furnace will now be described by way of example, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the general arrangement of the furnace and its associated control apparatus Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing part of said control apparatus of figure 1 Figure 3 is a block diagram showing a typical sequence of control states and intervening events that is met in controlling a real time process or other activity and Figure 4 is a comprehensive STATE DIAGRAM showing a complete sequence of control states and intervening events in the process of controlling combustion in the said furnace. Referring now to Figure 1, the furnace to be controlled has a furnace chamber 10 having an air inlet duct 12 housing a forced draught fan 14, a gas inlet duct 16 controlled by an electrically controlled on off valve 18, a coal inlet duct 20 controlled by an electrically controlled on off valve 22, and a smoke exit duct 24 incorporating an electrically controlled damper 26 and an induced draught fan 28. An electrical control apparatus 30 receives electrical feedback signals via lines 32, 34 and 36 from the following devices , a a first fan running ON sensing device 38 in the sir inlet duct 12 b a second fan running aS sensing device 40 in the smoke outlet duct 24 and c a temperature sensor 42 located in the fire bed of the furnace chamber. The electrical control apparatus 30 delivers control action initiating signals via lines 44, 46, 48,50 and 51 to the following devices a the forced draught fan 14 b the induced draught fan 28 c the gas control valve 18 d the coal control valve 22 and e the damper 26. The electrical control apparatus 30 incorporates, as shown in Figure 2, a controller 52 which comprises essentially a micro processor 54 constituting a central processor unit , and an associated memory unit 56 having in addition to a normal series of addressable storage locations 58 for use in normal data processing activities of the processor, a single dedicated addressable storage location 60 which is intended to fulfil a special function that will be explained later in the specification. The processor 54 has a set of parallel address lines 62 for selecting in accordance with program instructions the respective storage locations 58 as required, for use in normal data processing activities, and a set of parallel data lines 64 for transferring data between the processor 54 and the memory unit 56. The controller 52 also incorporates a comparator 66 which is arranged, on receipt of an appropriate program instruction, to compare a storage location address then stored in the dedicated storage location 60 with another storage location address then supplied to it by a small group 62A of three of the address lines 62, the other group 62B of the address lines 62 being used to select or enable the dedicated storage location whereby to enable it to deliver its contents to the comparator 66. The storage location addresses compared in the comparator are preferably and advantageously addresses, allocated to the respective STATES, of hypothetical storage locations constituting an hypothetical extension of the memory unit 56. An output signal TRUE FAISE from the comparator 66 is supplied through an AND gate 68 to the data lines 64 of the processor 54 when an input control signal READ is supplied by the processor to a second input circuit 70 of that gate. The address stored in the dedicated storage location 60 may be changed to the address then present at the address line group 62A by the application of a control pulse WRITE to a control input circuit 72 of an AND gate 74 connected between the data lines 64 of the processor 54 and the WRITE ENABLE input of the dedicated storage location 60, so that the AND gate 74 is enabled only when the data lines 64 indicate via a second input circuit 75 of that gate the logical valueTRUE for the STATE just evaluated. Referring now to the Figure 3, there is schematically illustrated there the matters mentioned in the introductory paragraphs of this specification. In the rectangular boxes 80, 82, 84, etc. are typical states of readiness e.g. for the furnace control system , box 80 being a state of readiness for starting a first fan, and box 82 being a state of readiness for starting a second fan. These boxes are shown as giving rise at their right hand sides to the emission of the necessary control signals and in some cases indicating signals to cause the control sequence to progress further, in the case of box 80, for example, by causing fan 1 to be started. In between the boxes 80, 82, 84, etc. are indicated the necessary operating mode increments that have to occur for the system to reach the respective next states of readiness. These increments are shown in round ended envelopes 86,88, 90 to which at their right hand sides are pointed arrows representing the feedback data that have to be generated in order to indicate that those operating mode increments have been achieved. Single headed arrows typically 92, 94 proceeding down the paper from one state of readiness to another via an associated Operating mode increment indicate the direction i.e. forward direction in which the control sequence is capable of progressing between those states. Two headed arrows typically 96, 98 indicate that the process may progress in either direction between the relevant two states, e.g. 100 and 102. In each of the STATE boxes 80, 82, 84, etc.the statement there appearing is abbreviated to indicate merely the control action for which the state is the state of readiness when control of the system is progressing in said forward direction. When control of the system is progressing in the reverse direction, at a bi directional arrow, the control action to be initiated on attainment of a bi directional STATE is the reverse of that indicated in the STATE box. Thus, on achievingSTATE 6 box 100 from STATE 7 box 102 , the control action to be initiated is CLOSE DAMPER, TURN GAS ON . In each of the intervening envelopes 86, 88 and 90 the statement there appearing indicates the operating mode increment which must exist before the system, as seen by the control apparatus 30, changes from its current state to the next state. The operating mode increment is an essential ingredient of such next state for the control apparatus 30. Each STATE box bears in its upper right hand corner the identity number of that STATE. For any system controlling a real time process or other activity, the operation of that system can be represented by a STATE DIAGRAM comprising the various successive readiness STATES and intervening OPERATINGMODE INCREMENTS that are experienced during operation of this system. The sequence of readiness STATES andMODE INCREMENTS will close upon itself to form a loop, and there may also be subsidiary loops within the main loop. For convenience, such a STATE DIAGRAM may omit some or all of the indications of the control signals that have to be emitted, and the feedback data that have to be received. Such a STATE DIAGRAM will result from an analysis of an equipment or system to be controlled. From the STATE DIAGRAM it will be appreciated that, providing the analysis has been carried out correctly and fully, the system can exist in, or be following up upon, only one readiness STATE at a time, all the other states of the state diagram being at that time non existent. Thus, each readiness state can be looked upon as a logical variable, having the possible values TRUE or FALSE according to whether or not the state is currently existent or non existent for the system. One state will follow from the preceding state provided the relevant operating mode increment has been achieved, and this will either have been achieved or not so achieved. Thus, each operating mode increment can likewise be locked upon as a logical variable, having a value TRUE or FALSE according to whether that operating mode increment has been achieved or not. Thus, we can write the logical statement STATE N OMI N,N l STATE N l where N is integral and can have any value up to P, the latter being the number of states in the STATE DIAGRAM. The existence or otherwise of any given state can thus be determined by consideration of the relevant preceding logical states for the system and the feedback data from which the logical values of the said operating mode increments can be obtained. The logical value of a state once determined as TRUE can be used in evaluating other logical states which depend upon that state, that is by looking to see whether a state in question is the state last determined to have the TRUE value. If it is, then that state has the TRUE value, otherwise it has theFALSE value. These values are then used in evaluating the relevant STATE using the above logical statement. Referring now to the Figure 4, the STATEDIAGRAM for operating the furnace shown in the Figures 1 and 2 in the desired way is set out there. The furnace is intended, in its normal operating mode, to be fired with coal, control of the combustion process being achieved by control of the air supplied to the furnace chamber, by means of damper control and if necessary by fan control. However, to start the furnace, gas is supplied to the furnace chamber until the furnace fire bed has achieved a temperature sufficient to ignite coal. Thereupon the coal supply to the furnace chamber is initiated, and later, on the achievment of a still higher fire bed temperature, the gas supply is cut off. It is believed that this state diagram will be self explanatory in the light of the explanation given above with reference to the Figure 3, though mention should be made here of the first state in the diagram. This is a state of readiness for switching on the system and starting the process. Though for convenience and clarity, that state is designated as PLANT OFF , it could be marked alternatively as STARTSYSTEMS . The logical statements describing the operation of the system may be expressed in a FORTRAN lIKE programming language as follows ST1 ST10.OR. STll.AND.RESET .AND. T.LT.400 ST2 STl.AND.ON ST3 ST2.AND.FANl ST4 ST3.AND.FAN2OK .OR. ST9.AND. T.LT. 400 ST5 ST4.AND. T.GT.400 ST6 ST5.AND. T.GT.600 .OR. ST7.AND. T.LT.800 ST7 ST6.AND. T.GT.800 ST8 ST7.AND. T.GT.1000 ST9 ST6.AND. T.LT.600 STlO ST6.AND.NOT.ON STll ST8.AND. T.LT.1000 where the following items have the following meaning ST1 means STATE 1 T means TEMPERATURE LT means LESS THAN FANlOK means FAN 1 RUNNING O.K. GT means GREATER THAN The conditions for the operation of the various control elements fans, control valves and dampers are given by the logical statements FAN1 .NOT. STl.OR.ST8 FAN2 .NOT. STl.OR.ST8.OR.STll GAS ST4.OR.ST5 COAL ST5.OR.ST6 DAMPR ST6 The processor is provided with an operating program which, inter alia, causes the processor to cyclically evaluate typically 30 times per second each statement of the above group of eleven logical statements, whereby to determine which state currently has a TRUE value, and upon finding a change in the state having aTRUE value, to update a storage location e.g. 60 dedicated to storing the identity of the STATE currently having the TRUE value, and to emit appropriate control signals for controlling the operation of the process being controlled. In determining the logical values of the successive states, the processor uses the identity of the most recently determined TRUE STATE to determine the logical values of the earlier states in the set, and assesses from the relevant feedback data the logical values of the relevant operating mode increments. The value of each said earlier state is obtained by comparing its identity with the identity of the STATE currently held in said dedicated storage location, said value being TRUE when the identities equate, otherwise the state value is FALSE. As an example of how the processor may operate, reference will be made to Figure 2. The processor operates to store in the dedicated storage location 60 at all times the identity of the STATE most recently determined by the processor to have the TRUE value. This is achieved in the following manner. After evaluating see later for a description of the evaluation process the logical value of a STATE, the processor applies a UNIT binary signals to each of the address lines 62 in the set 62B whereby to enable the dedicated storage location 60 in readiness for possible modification of its contents, b signals corresponding to the identity of the STATE just evaluated to the data input 73 of storage location 60, c a WRITE pulse to one input 72 of the AND GATE 74, and d a control signal to the other input 75 of AND GATE 74, which signal is TRUE if the STATE just evaluated has been found to be TRUE, or likewise FALSE if the STATE just evaluated has been found to be FALSE. If the STATE just evaluated has been found to be TRUE, the AND GATE 74 allows the WRITE PULSE applied at input 72 to be fed to the WRITE ENABLE input of storage location 60 thus causing the STATE identity appearing on lines 62A to be written into that storage location as the new, currently TRUE STATE identity. If, however, the STATE just evaluated has been found to beFALSE, no such WRITE PULSE will be fed to the storage location 60, so that its contents will remain unchanged.In this latter case the identity of the currentlyTRUE STATE will remain unchanged. As mentioned earlier, the identity of an evaluated STATE and that of the STATE stored in the dedicated storage location 60 may be the absolute i.e. actual identity of the STATE, e.g. STATE 6 , though preferably it is the address of an hypothetical storage location in an hypothetical extension of the memory unit 56, which hypothetical storage location has been allocated to that STATE. In the latter case, the needs of the system are satisfied expeditiously and efficiently without having to use extra storage locations in the memory unit 56 and extra processing time accessing the actual identity, since the hypothetical address allocated to the currently TRUE STATE is unique and can be compared with the hypothetical addresses of the locations uniquely allocated to the other STATES in the SET. To evaluate the logical value of a STATE, the logical value of the or each state in the relevant logical statement is deQernLned by applying the identity of that particular state to the group 62A of the address lines and enabling the dedicated storage location 60 via the group 62B of the address lines thereby to compare in the comparator 66 that identity with the identity currently stored in the dedicated storage location 60. If the two identities are the same, the comparator transmits a TRUE signal back to the processor, which thereupon uses that TRUE signal to evaluate the logical value of the state that is dependent on that state just determined by said comparison. If on the other hand, the said two identities are different, the comparator transmits a FALSE signal back to the processor, which thereupon uses that FALSE value in the evaluation of the state under consideration. The said operating program for the processor also causes the processor to evaluate the above five logical statements FAN1, FAN2 etc. which determine when the respective control elements should be activated or maintained activated, and to emit appropriate control signals for effecting a desired control of the respective control elements. summarizing the operation of the processor, the processor operates to determine the logical value of a STATE, say STATE 8, in the following manner a it determines the logical value of STATE 7 by comparing the address as defined by the group 62A of address lines with the address in the dedicated storage location 60. If the addresses are equal, STATE 7 has the value TRUE, otherwise it has the value FALSE.This information is transmitted back to the processor via the data lines 64 b the processor then determines the logical value of the associated operating mode increment and combines it with the returned value of STATE T to ascertain the value of STATE 8 c if STATE 8 has the value TRUE, the processor thereupon emits a WRITE signal to cause the address of STATE 8 to be stored in the dedicated storage location 60 in place of the former stored STATE address. Though in the system described above hardware has been used to enable the said comparisons and the changing snd storing of the STATE currently having the value TRUE, equivalent software means may be used if desired as will appear from what follows 1. For use with an LINTEL 8080 microprocessor, it is assumed that the A register will hold the logical value of the STATE, and that the H and L registers will hold the STACK and SET selection numbers, this assumes that the processor is intended to handle two or more independent SETS of STATE variable statements for operating different process controls simultaneously . It is also assumed that 256 i.e. 28 STATES are are possible in each of 16 i.e. 2 possible SETS. The program runs as follows READ EiiTRY POINT MOV A, L L STATE NUMBER MOV L, H Now L SET NUMBER MVI H, 10 HL ADDRESSES lOOOH SET NO CMP M COMPARE STATE STORED WITH STATE INTERROGATED MVI A, SET A FALSE RNZ RETURN IF COMPARISON UNEQUAL MVI A, FF ELSE A TRUE IF COMPARISON OK RET RETURN ANYWAYWRITE ENTRY POINT ORA A TEST INCOMING VAWE RP RETURN IF POS.I.E.FALSE MOV A, L ELSE A STATE NUMBER MOV L, H L SET NUMBER MVI H, 1 HL 1000H SET NUMBER MOV M, A SET STATE INCOMING STATE NO RET END 2. For use with a HEWLETT PACRARD 1000 mini computer it is assumed that the A register will hold the logical value of the STATE, while the register B will hold the STATE and SET SELECTION NUMBERS, and also that 256 STATES are possible in each of 16 possible SETS. The program runs as follows READ READ NOP STORE RETURN ADDRESS LDA AND 3377 A NOW HOLDS STATE NUMBER SiP B STATE NO., A HOLDS COMPOSITE ALF, ALF SET NO. IN LOWEST BITS OF A AND B17 A NOW SET NUMBER ADA SET A ADDRESS RELEVANT SET STORE LDA A,I A NOW HOLDS CURRENT STATE NO.

ONLY ADA SET A ADDRESSES RELEVANT SET STORE STB A,I PUT THIS SET STORE TO NEW STATE JMP ALLOC,I AND RETURN Thus it is seen that direct software implementation of the STATE variable is relatively simple although it does become necessary to call a subroutine in order to read or allocate a STATE variable, while other variables may be read or allocated directly in the normal way. Though such a software implementation of the inventive concept may be used, it will provide processing that is not quite so fast as that provided by the hardware form of implementation described above.When even faster processing is required to deal with the needs of a particular system to be controlled, micro programming techniques may be used to handle suitable parts of the program. Where desired a single processor may be arranged to control two or more simultaneously operating processes, in which case there must be one dedicated storage location 60 for each such process and in such a case the control program for the processor must identify the particular dedicated storage location and the particular SET of STATES to be used at any particular instant. Furthermore, whereas the processor has been described as successively evaluating all of the statements in a SET to find the STATE currently having aTRUE value, the control program may be arranged instead to evaluate only those STATES which are closely adjacent to the currently TRUE STATE in the SET and to which the system may progress from its current TRUE STATE. Control systems embodying the present invention have the following principal advantages, when compared with equivalent prior art systems. The control program for the processor has a one for one correspondence with the original STATEDIAGRAM definition of the required control algorithm as produced by the control system engineer. This allows the program to be written more easily, more efficiently, and with a higher degree of assurance that it will correctly perform the required control. Moreover, that control program has the advantage that its logic is very easily checked validated by inspection and comparison against the control engineer s STATE DIAGRAM for the process. The complexity of the control program for the processor varies directly with the complexity of theSTATE DIAGRAM of the process to be controlled. This contrasts favourably with that of a control program for a control processor which program is devised according to the normal prior art technique for controlling a real time process, in which technique for any increase in the complexity of the STATE DIAGRAM there is a related disproportionately large increase in the complexity of the control program. The reduced complexity of the control programs for a processor according to the present invention leads to substantial reductions in the storage requirement for the program, and in the execution time of the program. Though the invention has been described in relation to the control of a real time process of an industrial character furnace temperature control , the invention may also be applied to other systems of controlled activity which involve in some way a the passage of time in which reactions may occur in response to control actions b the feedback of data defining the behaviour of the system in response to control actions taken earlier or other system disturbances and c the taking of other control actions whether of a corrective or instigational nature in response to the data fed back. Such other control systems may relate, for example, to military, ecological, or economic modelling systems.
