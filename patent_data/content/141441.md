# Communication receiving unit for the suppression of noise and interference signals.

## Abstract
Communication receiving unit for the suppression of noise and jamming signals, which receiving unit comprises a plurality of antenna elements 1A 1N adaptive weighting filters 7 The detector 5 comprises first means 40, 41 for determining a time averaged power value W₁ concerning the signal y from the combination circuit 4 , and second means 42, 43 for determining a time averaged value W₂ of the cross correlation concerning the output signal y and the replica d . The adjusting means 8 are designed for generating modified adjusting signals on the basis of the supplied time averaged values W₁ and W₂ for a more accurate adjustment of the weighting filters 7
