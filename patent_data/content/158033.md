# A method of controlling a fast fluidized bed boiler.

## Abstract
A completely cooled fast fluidized bed boiler comprises a reactor 4 having a bottom section 3 , an integrated pri mary non centrifugal mechanical particle separator 5 , a gas pass 7 containing convective heat exchangers 10 , and means 6,8,9 for controllably recirculating separated parti cles into the reactor bottom section 3 . Reactor 4 , separator 5 and gas pass 7 are built as an integrated unit within one and the same cooling system. The boiler is controlled by maintaining the bed temperature substantially constant or within a relatively narrow temperature interval by regulating the recirculation rate dependent on boiler load. For regulating the recirculation rate a non mechanical valve, preferably a so called L valve 8 , is used.
