# WINCH AND ATTACHMENT THEREFOR

## Abstract
A removable attachment for a winch has a C shaped member 5 which fits over the drum 2 of the winch 1 and applies a radially inward force to runs 3 of a rope around the drum 2 . The C shaped member 5 is resilient and its lips are pressed over the rope on the drum 2 so that it extends more than half way round the drum. The C shaped member 5 has a projection 11 extending from one lip to abut against the lead run 4 of the rope, which prevents free rotation of the C shaped member 5 on the drum. The member 5 may be frusto conical to conform to the outline of a conventional winch drum. In this way a large variety of standard hand powered winches can easily and quickly be converted to ones having a self tailing action.
