# A TARGET APPARATUS

## Abstract
A target, such as a dart board, has a target face defining a plurality of beds into which the darts are to be embedded. The target comprises two superimposed layers of conductive elements located under the face of the target. The conductive elements of each layer are insulated from each other and the arrangement is such that a unique pair of elements, one from each layer, lies under each bed. Separate electrical identifying signals are applied to the conductive elements of one of the layers, and means are provided for detecting signals present on the conductive elements of the second layer. When a projectile is embedded in the target the shaft of the dart interconnects the two layers lying under that bed, and thus signals on the first layer are connected to the second layer, and are detected, enabling the location of the dart to be determined. Thus the score during a game of darts can be kept automatically.
