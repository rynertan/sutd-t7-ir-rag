# PESTICIDAL FORMULATIONS SUITABLE FOR ELECTRODYNAMIC SPRAYING AND A SOLUTION SUITABLE FOR USE IN MAKING THEM

## Abstract
Pesticidal liquid formulations comprising a non polar liquid diluent and 0.5 to 80 by weight of pesticide, the formu lation having a viscosity of 1 to 50 centistokes, and compound also sufficient of a resistivity lowering agent to reduce the resistivity to 10⁶ and 10¹⁰ ohm centimetres, the resistivity lowering agent being a quaternary ammonium surfactant of specified formula. Also claims non polar diluent solutions suitable for making such pesticidal compositions.
