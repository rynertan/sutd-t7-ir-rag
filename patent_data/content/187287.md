# Internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In a four valve engine having a pair of intake ports and a pair of exhaust ports, the hole for inserting the spark plug or the fuel injection nozzle is obliquely formed between the exhaust ports so that one end of the hole opens in the lower surface of the cylinder head at the center of the combustion chamber and the other end of the hole opens between the spring seat portions for the exhaust valve springs and the opening of the exhaust ports in the side face of the cylinder head.
