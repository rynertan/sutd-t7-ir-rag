# Process and device for the preparation of a combustible gaseous mixture.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for the preparation of a combustible gaseous mixture or product gas from a non gaseous fuel in which a gasifier is used provided with a rotatably driven cup shaped support grate 3. A granular or pulverized refractory auxiliary material and fuel are con tinuously fed to the inner side of said grate, a gasification medium or process gas being fed to the outer side of the grate, whereupon the resulting product gas and the ex hausted auxiliary material with ash from the fuel, are discharged separately. According to the invention the fuel consists, at least partly, of a residual oil previously fed into the fuel chamber 14, 15. Furthermore the invention is embodied in a device which is designed to perform the said process.
