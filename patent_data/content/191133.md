# Stable salts of SAM with polyanions.

## Abstract
Stable salts of S adenosyl L methionine with water soluble polyanions, such as polyphosphates, polyvinylsul fonates sulfates or phosphates, polyacrylates, polystyrene sulfonates, are described. The salts according to the invention, prepared by pre cipitation from aqueous solutions of pH not exceeding 3.5, possess peculiar stability, solubility, nonhygroscopicity and are valuable for use as active constituents in pharmaceuti cal compositions.
