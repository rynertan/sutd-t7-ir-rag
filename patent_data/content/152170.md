# SEWING METHODS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A dual chain sewing machine for aligning the edges and the corresponding seam tracks of pieces of a garment that have different curvatures and for sewing the pieces together along the seam tracks includes two flexible, elongated carriers, which move at approximately the same linear speed and which are mounted and arranged for motion around continuous paths. Each carrier has pins extending from it in a direction transverse to the direction of movement, with the pins of one carrier extending towards the pins of the other carrier. A first fabric piece is applied to the pins of the first carrier when a pin bearing portion of the first carrier is in a path segment corresponding to the seam track on the first fabric piece a second fabric piece is applied to the pins of the second carrier when a pin bearing portion of the second carrier is in a path segment corresponding to the seam track on the second fabric piece. The second carrier is guided towards the first carrier so that the pins of the first carrier engage the second fabric piece, and then the second carrier is guided away from the first carrier. Consequently, the second fabric piece is transferred from the second carrier to the first carrier and aligned with the first fabric piece already on the pins of the first carrier. The first carrier transports the fabric pieces to a sewing machine, which sews them together along the desired seam track.
