## Description
PHOTOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS This invention relates to novel copolymers which are good mordants for dyes used in photographic systems and to photographic elements using such copolymers. It is well known in the photographic art to use various polymers as mordants for preventing the migration of dyes. Various polymeric mordants are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos, 3,898,088 3,958,995 4,131,469 and 4,147,548 West German Patent Application OLS No. 2,941,818 and Japanese Patent Application OPI the term OPI as used herein designates a published, unexamined Japanese patent application Nos. 30,328 78 and 17,352 81. However, when photographic prints containing dyes itordanted by such mordants are exposed to fluorescent light, mercury lamp light, or sunlight, the dyes are chemically changed or decomposed. If the density of the dye images is reduced by the chemical change or decomposition of the dyes, the image quality of the photographic prints is greatly reduced. Polymeric mordants with reduced chemical change or decomposition of dye images on exposure to light are disclosed in U.K. Patent Nos. 2,011,912 and 2,093,041 and U.S. Patent No. 4,282,305. However, when using these polymeric mordants, the time required for transferring dyes is greatly prolonged owing to, perhaps, the poor mordanting property of the polymeric mordants, and such mordants are unsuitable for application in diffusion transfer color photography. A first object of this invention is to provide a photographic element containing a polymeric mordant that causes reduced chemical change or decomposition of dye images by the action of light.

A handenning agent may also be canesinp Two or more polymeric mordants of this invention may be used in one layer or in two or more layers, and the polymeric mordant of this invention may be also used with other known mordants in one layer or different layers of the same photographic element. Furthermore, the polymeric mordants of this invention can be used in surplus dye capturing mordant layers described in, for example, U.S. patent No. 3,930,864. Examples of known mordants which can be used with the polymeric mordants of this invention are the mordants described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,131,469 and 4,147,548 and Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 136,626 77 126,027 79 and 145,529 79. The total amount of the polymeric mordant used can be easily determined, depending on the amount of dye or dyes to be mordanted, the kind or composition of the polymeric mordant, and the image forming process, and is generally about 20 to about 80 by weight of the mordant layer and about 0.5 to about 8 g m2 after drying in coverage thereof, and Preferably about 40 to about 60 by weight and about 1 to about 5 respectively. Additional materials used with the Dolymeric mordants to form photographic elements for the color diffusion transfer process will now be described in detail. When the photogranhic element is a photographic film unit, that is a film unit which is adaDted to be processed by passing the unit hetween a pair of juxtaposed pressure applying members, the photographic element is typically composed of the following elements 1 a photosensitive element, 2 an image receiving element containing the polymeric mordant of this invention, 3 at least one support, and, if desired, 4 a means for releasing an alkaline processing composition in the inside of the film unit, such as a rupturable container containing an alkaline processing composition. In one embodiment of the film unit, a photo sensitive element having single or plural silver halide emulsion layers coated on a support is imagewise exposed, superimposed in face to face relationship on an imagereceiving element having at least one layer composed of the polymeric mordant of this invention on a support, and then processed by spreading an alkaline processing composition betweenThoth the elements. It is preferred that the film unit be light shielded at both sides of the photosensitive element or film unit when the film unit is pulled out from a camera. In this case, the transferred image may be viewed by peeling off the imagereceiving element or without peeling off the imagereceiving element as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,415,645. The polymeric mordant of this invention is particularly advantageous when used in a film unit having an image receiving element that is peeled off after transfer of the dye images. In anothrrembodiment of this invention, a support, an image receiving element, and a photosensitive element in the film unit are integrated. For example, a film unit comprising a transparent support having formed thereon an image receiving layer containing the polymeric mordant of this invention a substantially opaque light reflecting layer erg., a titanium dioxide layer and a carbon black layer , and a single or plural photosensitive layers I is effective as disclosed inBelgian Patent No. 757,960. In this embodiment, after imagewise exposing the photosensitive element, the photosensitive element is disposed on an opaque cover sheet in face to face relationship, and then a processing composition is spread between both the elements. In another embodiment of this invention, an imagereceiving element is superimposed on a photosensitive element in an integrated state as disclosed in BelgianPatent No. 757,050, In this embodiment, a transparent support is coated with an image receiving layer containing the polymeric mordant of this invention, a substantially opaque light reflecting layer as, for example, described above , and single or plural light sensitive layers, and a transparent cover sheet is disposed thereon in face to face relationship. A rupturable container containing an alkaline processing composition including an opacifying agent veg., carbon black is disposed adjacent to the uppermost layer of the photosensitive layer and the transparent cover sheet. Such a film unit is imagewise exposed through the transparent cover sheet and then is pulled out from a camera, whereby the rupturable container is ruptured by means of pressureapplying members to spread a processing composition containing an opacifying agent throughout the space between the photosensitive layer and the cover sheet,Thus, the film unit is light shielded and the development can proceed. Furthermore, the polymeric mordant in this invention can be used in an image receiving layer of a photographic material as described in West German PatentNo. 3,045,183.3 that is, a photographic material composed of a non separable combination of a transparent support having coated successively thereon photosensitive element, an opaque reflective layer, and an imagereceiving layer. The dye image providing compound which is used in a combination with a silver halide emulsion layer in this invention is either a negative type or positive type and which may be an immobile compound and provides an immobile dye or provides an mobile dye when the photographic element containing this compound is processed with an alkaline processing composition. Negative type dye image providing compounds useful in this invention, include couplers capable of forming or releasing dyes by causing reaction with an oxidized color developing agent known in the art.Examples of such couplers are described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,227,550 and Canadian Patent No. 602,607. Preferable negative type dye image providing compounds are dyereleasing redox compounds which release dye by reacting with a developing agent in an oxidized state or an electron transfer agent. Specific examples of these compounds are described in U.S. Patent Nos, 3,928,312, 4,135,929, 4,055,428 and 4,336,332. Immobile positive type dye image providing compounds used in this ivention, include compounds capable of releasing a diffusible dye either without receiving any electron i.e., without being reduced or after receiving at least one electron i.e., after being reduced during photographic processing under alkaline conditions. Specific examples are described in U.S.Patent Nos. 4,199,354, 3,980,479, 4,199,355, 4,139,379, 4,139,389, and 4,232,107 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 69,033 78. Furthermore, a positive type dye image providing compound which is initially immobile under alkaline photographic processing conditions is also useful for the photographic element of this invention Typical examples thereof are dye developing agents described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,482,972 and 3,880,658. The final image dye or precursor thereof formed from the dye image providing compound may be or may not be in a metal complex state. Typical dyes useful for this invention include azo dyes, azomethine dyes, anthraquinone dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, etc., which may be in metal complex states. Among these dyes, cyan dyes, magenta dyes, and yellow dyes are particularly important. Examples of yellow dye providing compounds are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,597,200, 3,309,199, 4,013,633, 4,245,028, 4,156,609, 4,139,383, 4,195,992, 4,148,641 and 4,148,643 Japanese PatentApplication COPI Nos. 114,930 76, 16,130 81 and 71,072 81 Research Disclosure, 17630 1978 and Research Disclosure, 16475 1977 . Examples of magenta dye providing compounds are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,453,107, 3,544,545, 3,932,380, 3,931,144, 3,932,308, 3,954,476, 3,233,237, 4,255,509, 4,250,246, 4,142,891, 4,207,104 and 4,287,292 Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos.106,727 77, 23,628 78, 36,804 80, 73,057 81, 71,060 81 and 134 80. . Examples of cyan dye providing compounds are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,482,972, 3,929,760, 4,013,635, 4,268,625, 4,171,220, 4,242,435, 4,142,891, 4,195,994, 4,147,544, and 4,148,642 U.K. Patent No. 1,551,138 Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 99,431 79, 8827 77, 47,823 78, 143,323 78, 99,431 79, and 71,061 81 European Patent EPC Nos. 53,037 and 53,040 and Research Disclosure, 17630 1978 and 16475 1977 Furthermore, a dye releasing redox compound having a dye moiety the light absorption of which is temporarily shifted can be used in this invention as the dye precursors. Examples of such redox compounds are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos 4,310,612,T 999,003, 3,336,287, 3,579,334, and 3,982,946 U.K. Patent No. 1,467,317 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 158,638 82. A typical photographic process for obtaining color diffusion transfer images using such dye releasing redox compounds is described in Photographic Science andEngineering, Vol. 20, No. 4, pages 155 164, Julyj August, 1976. In the above described process, any silver halide developing agent which can cross oxidize dye releasing redox compounds can be used Such a silver halide developing agent may be present in an alkaline processing composition or in a photographic layer of the photographic element. Examples of typical silver halide developing agents which can be used in this invention include hydroquinones, aminophenols, phenylenediamine, and pyrazolidinones e.g., phenidone, l phenyl 3 pyrazolidinone, dimeson i.e., l phenyl 4,4 dimethyl 3 pyrazolidinone , l p tolyl 4 methyl 4 oxymethyl 3 pyrazolidinone, 1 4 methoxyphenyl 4 methyl 4 oxymethyl 3 pyrazolidinone, l phenyl 4 methyl 4 oxymethyl 3 pyrazolidinone, etc. , as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 16,131 81. Black and white developing agent such as pyrazolidinones are particularly preferred because they generally reduce the formation of stain in the imagereceiving layer to a greater extent than color developing agents such as phenylenediamines. The processing composition used for processing the photographic element of this invention is an aqueous solution containing a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium phosphate, etc., and having a pH preferably greater than 9, and more preferably greater than 11.5.

Then, 20 ml of distilled water degassed with nitrogen gas and added with 1.00 g of potassium persulfate and 10 ml of distilled water degassed and added with 0.38 g of sodium hydrogen sulfate were simultaneously added to the mixture and the resultant mixture was heated with stirring for 4 hours.Thereafter, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered to provide a polymer dispersion latex ii Quaternarization reaction In a reaction vessel was placed 200 g of the above described latex having a 10.3 solid component and then 22.6 g of l,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane was added thereto at room temperature, followed by stirring for 3 hours at 800C, The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, dialyzed in pure water for 3 days to remove unreacted amine, and then filtered to provide a polymer Illustrated Compound 6 mordant dispersion. One of the features of this invention is that the mordant in this invention is used in the form of a dispersion polymer latex of a crosslinked polymer, which prevents the transfer of the polymeric mordant from the mordant layer during storage and processing of the photographic element, and also prevents reduction in the concentration of dye and reticulation on the mordant layer caused by transfer of the polymeric mordant. Furthermore, by employing the polymeric mordant in the form of a dispersion of the crosslinked polymer, good dye images can be formed in a short period of time. Also, the polymeric mordant of the invention can form dye images in a short period of time, and can strongly retain dyes therein. Dyes mordanted by this mordant exhibit less chemical change or decomposition by light in both oxygen rich environments and the oxygenpoor environments. Accordingly dyes mordanted with this mordant retain exceptionally good properties when stored for a long period of time. The above described advantages of this invention are particularly evident when the polymeric mordant of this invention is used in a peel apart photographic element.

The three photosensitive sheets a to c of this invention described above contained Compounds 1, 2 and 6 respectively as the polymeric mordants of this invention. Comparison photosensitive sheets p and q were also prepared in the same manner described above except that the following comparison quaternary ammonium salt polymers were used in layer 1 in place of the polymeric mordant of this invention. Comparison Polymer 1 poly N methyl N vinylbenzylpiperidiniumammonium chloride co styrene co divinylbenzene . Comparison Polymer 2 poly N,N,N trimethyl Nvinylbenzylammonium chloride co styrene co divinylbenzene After imagewise exposing each of the above described photosensitive sheets a to b and comparison photosensitive sheets p and q , each photosensitive sheet was assembled with the above described processing composition and the cover sheet in an integrated state and the processing composition was spread between the photosensitive sheet and the cover sheet at a thickness of 85 Wm at 250C by means of pressure applying members, whereby transferred color images were obtained. The densities of the color images were measured on each sample and the results are shown in Table 1. From the results shown in Table 1 below, it can be seen that the dyes mordanted by the polymeric mordants,Compounds 1, 2 and 6 have better light fastness than the dyes mordanted by the Comparison Polymer 1. Also, it can be seen that although the dyes mordanted by theComparison Polymer 2 have almost same light fastness as the dyes mordanted by Compounds 1, 2 and 6, the dyes mordanted by the Comparison Polymer 2 are far inferior to the dyes mordantedby the Compounds 1, 2 and 3 in the point of the transferred dye density. Thus, by using polymeric mordant Compounds 1, 2 and 6, dye images having both good light fastness and high density can be obtained. In addition, photosensitive sheets a c , p and q , prepared as above were exposed through a color test chart. Each photosensitive sheet was superposed on a cover sheet prepared as described above and then the above described processing composition was spread between the sheets at a thickness of 85 ym by means of a pressure applying members to obtain transferred color images. The mono sheet assemblies thus prepared containing transferred images were allowed to dry for 2 weeks at 400C and 30 relative humidity, and thereafter, the photosensitive sheet sides of the mono sheet assemblies were irradiated by a xenon lamp at 100,000 lux for 4 hours. The reduction in density obtained in the dye images by the irradiation is also shown in Table 1, with the reflection density before the irradiation having the value l0.

The three dye image receiving sheets d to f according to the invention contained above describedCompounds 1 , 2 and 6t, respectively. Comparison dye image receiving sheets r and s were also prepared following the above procedure except that the two comparison quaternary ammonium salt polymers as used in Example 1 were used in place of the polymeric mordants in layer 1 . After exposing the above described photosensitive sheets through a color test chart, the photosensitive sheets were stperimposed on the above described dye image receiving sheets, a processing composition having the following formula II was spread between both the sheets at a tnickness of 60 pm by means of pressureapplying members, and the photosensitive sheets were peeled apart from the dye image receiving sheets having dye images found thereon after 2 minutes. The dye image receiving sheets having the transferred images thus formed were dried and irradiated by a fluorescent lamp at 17,000 lux for 3 days. The reduction in density caused by the irradiation is shown in Table 2 below with the reflection density before irradiation being assigned the value 1.0.

By changing development time before performing peel apart, a time T80, unit sec. required for reaching a density of 80 of the finally attained density D was measured in each sample. The results are shown in Table 2. From the results shown in Table 2, it can be seen that the dyes mordanted by dye image receiving sheets using the polymeric mordants of this invention had higher light fastness than the dyes mordanted by comparison polymer 1. Also, although the light fastness of the dyes mordanted by comparison polymer 2 was almost same as those of the dyes mordanted by Compounds I , . 2 and 6 , it can be seen that the image forming speed was very low i.e., the T80 value was large when using comparison polymer 2e From the above results, it is clear that even in the case of a peel apart photographic element, the polymeric mordants of the invention produce transferred dyes having both excellent light fastness and high transfer speed of dyes.
