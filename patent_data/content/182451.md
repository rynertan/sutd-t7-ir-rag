# Polymeric hydrogel containing gas diffusion electrodes and the like and method of using the same in electrochemical systems.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with catalytic gas diffusion structures such as electrodes and barriers comprising, as an integral part of portion thereof, a non ionic aqueous gel such as a polyvinyl alcohol, rendering said electrode impervious to gas percolation, while retaining electrolyte contact with the structures and with methods of using said electrodes or barriers in a variety of electrochemical systems including electrolysis cells, fuel cells, batteries and others, as well as in metal recovery systems involving no electricity.
