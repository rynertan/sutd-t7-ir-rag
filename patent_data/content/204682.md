# Apparatus and methods for continuous injection molding.

## Abstract
Apparatus and methods for continuous injection molding of thermoplastic material into three dimensional sheets having a projection extending from a substantially uniform backing layer. An extrusion die having a face matching the surface of a rotatable mold drum with cavities therein provides molten thermoplastic material simultaneously into the cavities to form the projections and onto the surface to form the backing layer.
