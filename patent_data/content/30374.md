# Adhesive products and manufacturing methods.

## Abstract
The disclosed adhesive products include a carrier sheet bearing a polymeric film and an adhesive layer, over lying the film as in dry transfers or underlying the film in prodcts such as wire markers and other labels, or there may be adhesive laxers both over and underneath the polymeric film. A constituent initially contained in the poly meric film layer migrates into an ordinarily non tacky pro cursor of the adhesive layer, thereby rendering the pro cursor tacky. The precursor layer becomes adhesive only where it is opposite the polymeric film, being non tacky outside the area of the film. In important applications, the common area of film and adhesive layers does not cover the whole carrier sheet. Both the adhesive precursor layer and the polymeric film may include portions extending out side the common area.
