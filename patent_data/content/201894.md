## Description
The present invention relates to a control apparatus for a magnetic floating type rotor supported by an electromagnetic bearing. More particularly, it relates to an electromagnetic bearing control apparatus which is well suited to suppress a resonance amplitude of the unbalance vibration of a rotor, as described in the pre characterizing portion of claim 1. The schematic setup of a rotary machine supported by an electromagnetic bearing, in which attractive electromagnets are used for bearing, is as shown in Fig. 1. First, an apparatus which performs a unidimensional position control in only an X axial direction will be described. Coils 2 of electromagnets are arranged on the right and left of a rotor 1. When the rotor 1 shifts rightwards under this state, a control current I flows through the left electromagnet coil 2, and the rotor 1 undergoes an attractive force so as to be displaced leftwards. To the contrary, when the rotor 1 shifts leftwards, a control current I flows through the right electromagnet coil 2 so as to establish an attractive force. In this manner, the control current I is caused to flow through the electromagnet coil 2 on the opposite side in accordance with the rightward or leftward displacement of the rotor 1, to perform a servo control so that the rotor 1 may come to its central position owing to the resulting attractive force. In this case, at least one displacement sensor 3 is necessary for detecting the rightward and leftward displacements of the rotor 1. Often employed as the displacement sensor 3 are e.g. noncontacting sensors of the induction coil type, capacitance type, optical type, etc. A displacement signal As thus far described, the servo circuit for the position control of the rotor 1 in the X direction is constructed of the single displacement sensor 1, the two right and left electromagnet coils 2 as well as the corresponding power amplifiers 5, and the single control circuit 4. In general, the position control of the rotor 1 by the magnetic bearing requires two dimensional position controls in X and Y directions as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the servo circuits of the same specifications are juxtaposed as two sets for the X direction and for the Y direction. In Fig. 2, portions having the same functions as in Fig. 1 are indicated by the same symbols. Next, the features of the vibrations of a rotation axis will be explained. For elucidating the unbalance vibration, Fig. 3 is often used. It is assumed that the axis O When such symbols are assigned, forces acting on the rotor 1 due to unbalance are as follows On the other hand, the vibration of the rotor 1 is detected in the X and Y directions, and the vibration frequency agrees with the rotating speed Ω, so that the vibration is expressed by the following forms When a supporting rigidity based on the electromagnets through the servo control circuit in the X direction is equal to the same in the Y direction, namely, when the supporting rigidities of the bearing in the X direction and the Y direction are set to be isotropic, the vibration amplitudes in the X direction and the Y direction are equal to each other. Moreover, the phase difference between both the vibration components is 90 , and the X directional vibration leads over the Y directional vibration by 90 . These are expressed by the following equations As stated above, the rotor vibration becomes the circular motion for the equal supporting rigidities of the bearing and becomes the elliptic orbit in the presence of anisotropy. The senses of the orbits are the same as the sense of the rotor rotation and are forward. Therefore, when a complex displacement Z indicated by the following equation is introduced An example of an unbalance vibration response curve is shown in Fig. 5. The two peaks M₁ and M₂ of the vibration amplitude on the lower side of the rotational speed are resonance points in the rigid body mode of the rotor. The third peak M₃ of the vibration amplitude is a resonance point in the bending mode of the rotor. Regarding the conventional rotor supported by the magnetic bearing, the resonance points of the rigid body mode at low speed can be passed with their amplitudes suppressed by the adjustments of the proportional action, differential action and integral action of the servo control circuit. The resonance point of the bending mode of a high speed rotation, however, is inevitably passed with a sharp and large amplitude on account of an insufficient damping force. It is, rather, common that the rotor cannot be operated in excess of a rotational speed corresponding to the bending mode resonance point because the resonance amplitude of the bending mode cannot be suppressed even when those of the rigid body mode can be suppressed by skillfully adjusting the servo control circuit. A servo control circuit according to the pre characterizing portion of claim 1, for passing such a resonance point of the electromagnetic type rotor with the resonance amplitude suppressed is described in detail in the US A 4 128 795. In order to grasp the published invention, the principle of a tracking filter synchronous with a rotational speed, which has been known, and a method of controlling high damping impartation with the tracking filter will be described in divided stages. The general features of the rotor vibration in the case where the rotor is rotating in a high speed rotation region will be explained in conjunction with Fig. 2. It is assumed that the rotor be rotating near the bending mode resonance point M₃ shown in Fig. 5. As the rotor vibration on this occasion, the forward vibration synchronous with the rotational frequency attributed to the unbalance is the principal component, and besides, the fluctuating vibration of the rotor attributed to external forces such as the shaking of a casing develops. The vibration frequency of the fluctuating vibration is close to the natural frequency of the rigid body mode and is lower than the rotational frequency. Therefore, the amplitude Z of the rotor vibration is written in the following complex from by applying the aforementioned equation 7 Fig. 6 is a schematic arrangement diagram of a tracking filter for elucidating the operating principle thereof. When the amplitude Z In addition, the input signal Z Here, the signal Z₁ is passed through a low pass filter 11 in order to extract the D.C. component Subsequently, the signal Z₂ of the rotating coordinate system is multiplied by e The above is the principle of the filter for the component synchronous with the rotational speed. The filter is called the tracking filter when it follows up the rotational speed Ω. e Thereafter, x₁ and y₁ are passed through low pass filters 17 and 18 independently of each other, to obtain x₂ and y₂ Z₂ x₂ iy₂ . Further, these signals are subjected to the inverse transform of the transform T by a transposed matrix operation unit 19, to find x In this way, only the rotation synchronous components can be extracted from within the Next, the resonant amplitude reduction method employing this tracking filter synchronous with the rotational speed as described in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 93853 77 will be described with reference to Fig. 8. It is assumed that the displacements of the rotor in the X direction and the Y direction have been detected as The first process in the tracking filter is a transformation into the rotating coordinate system based on the following equation By the second process, signals are passed through low pass filters of gains K corresponding to the operation of integrating narrow bands to obtain the signals x₂ and y₂. The second process performs filtering operations for the X and Y directions separately from each other. By the third process, the output signals x₀ and y₀ are obtained through the inverse transform into the fixed coordinate system The output signals x₀ and y₀ are such that, in the vibration waveforms of the input signals In the critical frequency damping equipment shown in Fig. 8, for the purpose of reducing the resonance amplitude in the X direction by way of example, the Such a control system, however, has the disadvantage that the velocity signals x , y need to be created from the displacement signals x, y by the proportional plus differential circuits 6 and 16, so the circuit arrangement becomes complicated. The essence of this system is as stated below. The velocity signals x and y are created from the detected displacement signals An object of the present invention is to provide a control apparatus for an electromagnetic bearing in which the resonance amplitude of the rotational speed synchronous unbalance vibration of a rotor supported by the electromagnetic bearing is lowered. According to the invention as described in the characterizing portion of claim 1 the channels of an X direction control circuit and a Y direction control circuit are crossed to enhance a stability against a forward characteristic frequency. Besides, in order to solve the problem that a stability against a coexisting rearward characteristic frequency lowers without any measure, a tracking filter synchronized with a rotational frequency is jointly used. Thus, the enhancement of the stability is permitted against only the forward characteristic frequency near a resonance point, whereby the resonance amplitude of the unbalance vibration can be lowered. The invention is now described in more detail with reference to the drawings in which In a rotor supported by plain bearings, it is known that a self excited vibration called oil whip develops. The causes will be considered. The reaction of an oil film in the plain bearing is expressed with respect to the displacement and velocity of the rotor, as follows Conceptually speaking, the constants k With an electromagnetic bearing, however, the sign can be reversed by the arrangement of an electronic circuit so as to produce the action in the reverse direction, namely, the damping action. That is, when the channels of an X direction control circuit and a Y direction control circuit are crossed so as to establish k Therefore, the rotation synchronized tracking filter described before is jointly used, whereby the enhancement of the stability becomes possible as to only the forward characteristic frequency near a resonance point. On this occasion, the stability against the rearward characteristic frequency remains unchanged and does not lower. In this manner, using both the channel crossing and the rotation synchronized tracking filter, the enhancement of the characteristic frequency stability or damping capability is achieved as regards only the forward component. An unbalance vibration is a forward force, and the resonance peak thereof to be induced can be suppressed to a smaller resonance amplitude as the damping of the forward characteristic frequency is greater. Now, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 9. A displacement signal The detected displacement signals To be noteworthy here is that the following relations hold When note is taken of only the unbalance vibration components, Eqs. 20 hold, and hence, the output signals x In this manner, the additive and subtractive inputs are applied crossing the channels, whereby reaction forces for the components synchronous with the rotational speed are expressed as The greater coefficient α which is used for the additive and subtractive inputs in the channel crossing becomes the better is the damping effect. Since, however, there is the restriction of preventing the saturation of the electronic circuit, the gain may be adjusted so as to establish an appropriate value of the resonance amplitude. Fig. 10 shows a circuit arrangement well suited to the general case where the characteristics of the bearing are anisotropic to give rise to the unbalance vibration as illustrated by the elliptic orbit in Fig. 4 a or by Eq. 8 . In this case, the method of suppressing the forward vibration a Fig. 11 shows experimental data obtained when the rotation synchronous tracking filter and the channel crossing in the present invention were employed. The rotational speed is taken on the axis of abscissas, while the vibration amplitude is taken on the axis of ordinates. In the figure, ON signifies that the operation of the present invention in Fig. 9 was performed. OFF signifies that the channel crossing was turned off corresponding to α 0 . It is seen that the vibration amplitude is significantly lowered by the turn ON, and that it reverts to the original great value due to the turn OFF. Thus, according to the method of the present invention, even the resonance amplitude of the bending mode as shown in Fig. 5 is properly damped, and the rotor is permitted to pass the dangerous speed with the small resonance amplitude as indicated by the dotted line. According to the present invention, the following effects can be achieved
