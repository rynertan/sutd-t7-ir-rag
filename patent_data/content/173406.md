# Method and apparatus for adjusting the alignment of a sighting device and a pivotable member.

## Abstract
A method of adjusting the alignment of a sighting device 5 and a member 4 coupled therewith, said member being pivot able in at least one plane about a first pivot axis 3 , and at least part 7 of said sighting device 5 being pivotable about a second pivot axis 6 . On the pivotable member an apparatus is mounted which provides a parallel beam of radiation shining directly or indirectly on to the pivotable part 7 of the sighting device 5 , and being productive of a point image at the viewing end of the sighting device. The pivotable member is moved into a plurality of different angular positions relative to the first pivot axis 3 , and, if during these movements the point image is moved beyond a pre determined tolerance range, the coupling 8 between the pivot able member and the sighting device is adjusted. The apparatus comprises a frame which is provided with means 40, 41, 50, 51 for fastening the apparatus to the pivotable member, and carrying a source of radiation which, either directly or via an optical apparatus, such as a collimator 30, 80 shines a parallel beam of radiation on to the sighting device.
