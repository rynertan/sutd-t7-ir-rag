# Method for the separation and isolation of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, isolated conjugated bilirubin, and reference composition containing same.

## Abstract
A method for the separation and isolation of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin from an aqueous liquid contain ing one or both of the bilirubin components. The aqueous liquid is contacted with an interactive mordant for bilirubin. The bilirubin mordanted thereby is separated from the aque ous liquid and treated in an aqueous medium with a chaot ropic agent soluble in the medium to release the conjugated and or unconjugated bilirubin from the mordant. A preferred embodiment selectively dissolves either the conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin released from the mordant. Isolated conjugated bilirubin is thereby obtained having a purity in excess of 75 by weight. A reference composition containing the isolated conjugated bilirubin is also disclosed.
