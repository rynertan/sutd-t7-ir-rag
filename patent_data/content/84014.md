# Camera responsive charging apparatus for an electronic strobe flash unit.

## Abstract
An electronic strobe flash unit in a camera is charged in response to actuation of a shutter release member. To assure that the flash capacitor has sufficient charge to fire the strobe flash at the time of shutter release i.e. exposure , a logic circuit 66 functions to delay shutter release for a variable time interval, up to about 0.75 second. To assure that the exposure is effected after such time interval, the logic circuit is designed to operate only in response to the shutter releasing member being moved to a position in which shutter release is irreversibly initiated i.e. its shutter releasing position . This variable time delay is long enough to assure that the flash capacitor is charged sufficiently to produce a flash regardless of its previous condition, but is sufficiently brief to avoid disturbing the camera operator.
