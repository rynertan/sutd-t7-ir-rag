# Differential charge sensing system for a four device MTL memory cell.

## Abstract
A sensing system is provided for a four device memory cell having first T16 and second T18 transistors with first C3 and second C4 diffusion capacitances, respectively, storing unequal amounts of charge which are coupled to first B0 and second B1 bit lines, respectively. The cell is preferably a four device integrated injection logic or merged transistor logic MTL bipolar cell. The charges represent stored information and are maintained in a standby condition by maintaining a charge on the bit lines. When the information is to be sensed the bit lines are discharged through the cell to enhance the charge difference in the diffusion capacitances. The charge now stored in the diffusion capacitances is transferred onto the bit lines and detected by a differential sensing circuit 38 connected between the first and second bit lines to which are connected first and second equal valued resistors R5, R6 , respectively. The charge in the diffusion capacitances which results after enhancement may be transferred onto the bit lines by discharging the bit lines through the two resistors or by pulsing up the diffusion capacitances from a terminal remote from the bit lines to force the charge onto the bit lines.
