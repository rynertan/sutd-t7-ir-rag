## Description
IMPROVED DETERMINATION OF CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE IN BODY FLUIDS TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an improved method and composition for the determination of creatine phosphokinase. BACKGROUND ART The enzyme creatine phosphokinase, hereafter abbreviated CPK, is found in normal human serum and catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from creatine phosphate to adenosine diphosphate ADP to form adenosine triphosphate ATP and creatine. Analysis of CPK concentration in the serum is commonly used in the diagnosis of human diseases or disorders such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary infarction, cerebral infarction, hypothyroidism, liver disorder, skeletal muscle damage due to trauma or injury, and muscular dystrophy. An assay method for CPK using the reverse action of creatine phosphokinase and adenylate kinase AK was developed by Oliver, Biochem. J. 61, 116 1955 . This method was later improved by Rosalki, J. Lab. Clin. Med.61, 696 1967 , and Hess, et al., Am. J. Clin. Path 50, 89 196j. Further modifications of the procedure permitted the use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD instead of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADP in the final ultraviolet detection step. See OkiQ et. al., J. Lab and Clinical Med. 64, 299 1964 .The key reactions may be summarized as follows I. oxidized inactive CPK reduced thiol activator EMI2.1 reduced active CPK oxidized thiol activator II . ADP creatine phosphateEMI2.2 creatine III. ATP glucose hexodinase ADP glucose 6 phosphate IV. glucose 6 phosphate NAD EMI2.3 6 phosphoyluconate NADH To eliminate the need for ultraviolet detecting instrumentation the NADH formed in reaction IV above may be converted to NAD with the subsequent reduction of the tetrazolium compound 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride, hereafter INT, to form the red formazan dye INTH via enzymatic catalysis by diaphorase. See Avigad and Levin, N, Europ. J. Biochem. 1, 102 1969 .This reaction may be expressed as follows V. NADH INT diaphorase7 INTH NAD Hereinafter the sequence of reactions I through V will be called the Oliver Rosalki formazan method. A body fluid, such as serum, plasma, lymphatic fluid or the like is analyzed for CPK activity using this method by adding test fluid to a prewarmed reconstituted ly phol ized substrate containing activator, primary substrates, intermediate substrates, final substrates, coupling enzymes, adenylate kinase inhibitor AMP, buffering compounds and stabilizers. The test fluid is incubated at about 37 C for a fixed period of time usually about 10 minutes and then the reaction is stopped by the addition of acid. Likewise, water is added to another substrate and run as a reagent blank.Control serum having a known CPK activity is used to determine the activity of the unknown test serum. The Oliver Rosalki formazan method as currently in use has four major drawbacks. First, there is variable lag time in the activation of CPK by the thiol activator in raction I described above. While this lag can be followed using sqphisticated continuously monitoring colorimetric measuring equipment having a reagent blank vial and using a double beam, this lag is a disadvantage when an end point method is used as employed in batch analysis. Thus if less sophisticated colorimetric equipment is used for end point method analysis some variation in results is unavoidable in the method as currently employed. Second, there is a continuous increase in the reagent blank absorbance following reconstitution of the substrate because of the presence of all the components necessary for non serum CPK cho mogen production.Third, there is a difference between the reagent blank vial s absorbance and the test vial s absorbance due to the variable degree of solubilization of the final chromogen, INTH, in the presence of serum.This results in an inadequate reagent blank. Fourth, the control serum is unstable and displays variable activation times which necessitates labelling commerical serum containing CPK with wide ranges of activity. U.S. patent 4,012,286 describes a variation of theOliver Rosalki formazan method which differs in three important respects. 1 The serum CPK is preactivated prior to the start of enzyme catalysis and h r6me1 production. 2 A surfactant has been added to the enzyme substrate to aid in the solubilization of the chromogen eliminating the positive solubilization of serum on INTH. 3 As a result of the improved chromogen solubilization in the absence of serum the control serum has been replaced by an intermediate reaction product, i.e., a pure chemical standard, which is subsequently convereted to the final chromogen. In a general CPK assay as recommended by F.Meiattini, G. Giannini and P. Tarli Clin. Chem. 24, 498 1978 , U.S. patent 4,220,714 2m mole liter AMP, 2m mole liter ADP and 6m mole liter sodium fluoride are used for optimum effect however, residual AK activity is pronounced. Meiattini et. al., disclose an ATP ADP ratio of from 1 to about 10 however, a ratio of 1 was found to produce maximum inhibition of the interfering AK enzyme. It has been found, contrary to Meiattini, that a ratio of ATP ADP exceeding 10, and preferably 11 60, most preferably 15 25 , in the presence of fluoride ion, results in a superior composition for the inhibition of AK when employed in a diagnostic assay system for CPK MB isoenzyme, utilizing the inhibiting antibody approach as described by Neumeir et. al., Clin. Chem., Acta 7D, 445 1976 and Gerhardt et. al., Clin. Chem. Acta 1ss, 29 1977 , and either the traditional Oliver Rosalki formazan assay reaction sequence or the tetrazolium coupled improvement ofU.S. patent 4,012,286. This improved inhibition eliminates the need for serum blanks as required by the prior art methodology with only a small compromising reduction in CPK B turnover rate. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION In the Neumeir and Gerhart methodology, the residual B subunit activity of the MB CPK isoenzyme activity of serum is measured via a modified Oliver Rosalki coupled ultraviolet UV spectrophotemetric assay following treatment of the serum samples with inhibiting antibodies to the M subunit of the predominate serum CPK isoenzyme dimers MM and MB. Immuno inhibition is performed in a reaction mix containing all of the CPK activity assay components, except the primary substrate creatine phosphate CP . During this incubation phase, not only is complexation of M antibody with M CK subunits occurring, but serum adenylate kinase, activated by sulfhydryl reductants in the CPK assay mix, is catalyzing the interfering reaction of disproportionating of adenosine diphosphate ADP , the other primary CPK substrate present in the mixture, to form adenosine monophosphate AMP and adenosine triphosphate ATP . ATP, the same product of CPK catalysis, is subsequently coupled to the end product production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH . AK intereference is minimized with the use of the transition state complex like compound diadenosine pentaphosphate DAPP . However, insufficient inhibition ofAK, found in high concentrations in erythrocytes and hence found in commonly observed hemolyzed serum samples, has mandated that serum blanks i.e. the assay CP be monitored after immuno inhibition has occurred.Subsequently, CPK B catalysis is monitored following CP addition. Formerly, AK interference was not a problem in CPK isoenzyme determinations involving serum component separation prior to assay, of the classical electrophoretic and ion exchange methods. AK was physically separated from the isoenzyme of interest prior to activity staining or eluate analysis. With the use of an inhibiting antibody, the time consuming separation of CPK isoenzymes is avoided but the need for improved AK interference is critical, especially for applicability to many automated clinical instruments not designed for serum blank analyses. The improvement described herein involves utilization of an AMP ADP ratio, drastically different from that used in conventional CPK assays, with additional inclusion of fluoride to impart in total 1 dramatically improved inhibition of the adenylate kinase interference 2 a small compromising decrease in measured CPK B activity due to the enhanced competitive inhibi tion by AMP at a lower level of ADP. Table I illustrates the utilization of a high AMP ADP ratio in inhibiting purified human erythrocyte adenylate kinase. Residual AK activity is measured in reagent systems containing all necessary components of the OliverRosalki CPK assay. The systems vary as a function of three components AMP, ADP, and sodium fluoride. The data points cover a 1.43 5.72m Mole liter ADP range and a 2.9 29.2m Mole liter AMP range plus or minus 6m Mole liter NaF. As can be seen in Table I, the over riding parameter that dictates extent of inhibition of AK, or conversely the residual AK activity, is the AMP ADP ratio. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Pre activation of the inactive CPK is accomplied by a reduced thiol activator such as for example, glutathione, dithiothreitol, N acetyl cysteine, or cysteine Reaction I above prior to the beginning of enzyme catalysis and chromogen production. Sufficient thiol activator must be present to activate all of the CPK present in the body fluid. Therefore an excess of thiol activator is generally employed to assure the total activation of all CPK present. The CPK activating amount of the thiol activator may be determined by the simple expedient of measuring the intensity of color produced with varying amounts of added activator when samples having known concentrations of CPK are employed.Pre activation eliminates the inaccuracy resulting from the variable activation time of serum CPK because the CPK is fully active before coming into contact with the primary substrate ADP. This has been found to linearize chromogen production once the enzymatic reaction begins. Side reactions which result in non serum CPK chromogen production are also minimized by pre activation of the CPK in the absence of the final intermediate substrates INT and ADP. Three chromogen contributing side reactions which can lead to inaccurate results are a the reduction of INT by the thiol activator rather than by NADH, b the catalysis of ADP by CPK present as a contaminant in the coupling enzymes glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and hexokinase, and c the fact that the inhibitor AMP of adenylate kinase does not completely eliminate adenylate kinase interference found in the coupling enzymes of b above. By eliminating both ADP and INT from the pre activation mixture these side reactions are unable to take place prior to the beginning of the CPK enzvmatic reaction. The improved Oliver Rosalki formazan method therefore incorporates a unique sequence of steps in the carrying out of this method. In summary these steps are 1. Preactivation step The sample is mixed with a partial substrate containing a thiol activator, preferably glutathione, primary substrates, intermediate substrates, coupling enzymes, buffering compounds and stabilizers. However, missing from the partial substrate are the primary substrate ADP and the final substrateINT. The inhibitors AMP and a fluoride such as a alkali metal fluoride, for example, potassium fluoride or preferably sodium fluoride, may also, be added later, however, preferably it is added in the pre activation step.By utilizing from 5m mole liter to 8m mole liter fluoride ion, preferably about 6m mole liter, noncompetitive AK inhibition is acheived without precipatating magnesium ion, a necessary cofactor in the Oliver Rosalki results assay.The pre activation mixture is incubated, typically in a water bath or heating block at a temperature of from about 25 to about 40 C, 30 to 370C being preferred, for a length of time sufficient to optimally activate theCPK, generally about 3 to 5 minutes. In the preparation of the materials for the preactivation step it is preferred to employ two separate compositions, k4asQ U 7 lypholyzed partial substrate composition containing activator, creatine phosphate, NAD, glucose, hexokinase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and diaphorase and a second reconstituting reagent containing a fluoride, a buffer with a pH of between 6 and 7 and surfactant.In addition, when it is desired to eliminate the contribution of the M subunit of the CPK isoenzyme dimers MM 1 and MB from the assay, the lypholized partial substrate can contain anti CPK M inhibiting antibodies. The elimination of the M subunit contribution in the CPK assay is particularly valuable in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. When the ingredients for the partial substrate are thus prepared as two separate compositions, both such compositions are stable for long periods of time prior to use. The separate compositions are mixed to provide the reconstituted partial substrate used in the pre activation step. 2. Enzyme catalysis step A starting reagent, containing the primary substrate ADP, a tetrazolium salt dye such as INT, and the inhibitor AMP is mixed with the incubated pre activation mixture. 3. Addition of stop reagent a major advantage of the improved method is that it may be used to accurately measure CPK activity on clinical grade colorimeters.Usually this will require that the chromogen producing reaction be stopped by the addition of acid, as for instance hydrochloric acid HCl , after a time sufficient to allow adequate chromogen development. Twenty five minutes has been found to give satisfactory chromogen development. The above reactions take place generally at a pH of between 6 and 7 with a pH of from 6.3 to 6.5 being preferred. The body fluids which can be assayed by the improvedCPK assay procedure of this invention include blood serum, blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid CSF , lymphatic fluid and tissue homogenates. The various body fluids to be assayed by the methodology of this invention are to be from a human source although the general CPK assay is useful whenever animal body fluids are to be assayedThe preferred body fluid is human blood serum. Preferred compositions of the above are as follows EXAMPLE 1 Preactivation Reagent reconstituted Glutathione activator 5 m mole literCreatine phosphate from yeast 34.5 m mole literGlucose 12 m mole literHexokinase from yeast 5.5 U testGlucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase 2.24 U test from Leuconostoc mesenteroides Diaphorase from Clostriduim kluyveri 3 U testMagnesuim acetate 14.4 m mole liter 3 N morpholino propane sulfonic acid 82.18 m mole liter bufferSurfactant Emulphor EL 620 0.025 W VNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2.77 m mole liter from yeast Anti CPK M inhibiting antibody 2000 U liter from goat serum NaF 6 m mole liter The preparation above represents the composition in the reconstituted state.In a preferred emb 23T 8d the lypholyzed composition, the sulfonic acid buffer, surfactant and soduim fluoride, would be absent and added later during reconstitution.

The indicating device on the colorimeter should have been previously set to read zero absorbance for distilled water. The absorbance of each of the three vials is read on the colorimeter and recorded. The preferred way of expressing emzyme concentration is in International Units liter U liter . OneInternational Unit is the amount of enzyme that will transform one micromole of substrate per minute under standard conditions. Therefore the concentration ofCPK in the patients s sample may be calcuiated using the following formula U liter A Patient s vial A Blank vial x Conc. of standard in U liter A Standard vial A Blank vial wherein A absorbance. A chemical standard using glucose 6 phosphate in a concentration of 2 m moles liter which is equivalent to 80 U liter of serum has been found satisfactory as a standard in the above procedure. Therefore in the above formula the value U liter would be used as the concentration of standard in U liter. EXAMPLE 4 The data of Table 1 demonstrate the effects of varying amounts of AMP and ADP and the presence or absence of 6 m mole liter soduim fluoride on the assay of CPK. The reagents of Example 1 and 2 were utilized with the AMP andADP concentration listed in the table, with or without 6 m mole liter sodium fluoride.

Human serum samples, many being hemolytic due to sampling from patients undergoing heart surgery, were obtained from a local coronary care unit. Samples, stored refrigerated following collection, were assayed within three days using a UV test patterned after the Neumier et al .and Gerhardt et al. approached prior art differing essentially from the instant assay composition in that the AMP ADP ratio is 2.5 and in the absence of fluoride ion. Both the prior art composition and the assay composition of this invention containing the superior AK inhibition composition Example 1 and 2 were prepared lacking creatine phosphate. In the prior art assay system as expected, hemolytic sera exhibited greater sera blanks than nonhemolytic sera owing to erythrocyte AK. However, with the superior AK inhibition composition of the present system, little if any serum blank is evident. With values of B activity 8 U l commat 370C suggesting myocardial damage, the prior art serum blanks are significantly large to mandate routine determination, whereas their measurement is unnecessary for the present system.
