## Description
HIGH PERFORMANCE TYREThis invention relates to a pneumatic radial ply tyre and, in particular, a radial tyre suitable for use for truck, bus, light truck and other vehicles, and is mainly intended to provide improved high speed durability of such tyres without sacrificing wear life, and at the same time, to improve the maneuverability and the ride.The high speed durability of a tyre is mainly affected by the structure, the profile and the material used for the tyre. First of all, in the structure, a cross ply or bias tyre comprises a carcass composed of a plurality of rubberized ply layers each containing fibre cords embedded therein, the cords of one ply being crossed with respect to the next ply at an angle of 400 to 250 with respect to the equatorial line of the tyre. In one example, the carcass of a cross ply tyre for a truck or bus is composed of several ply layers of virtually unwoven fabric, each ply of which being superimposed with one another.Secondly the structure of a radial ply tyre comprises a carcass of a substantially radial construction composed of one ply layer containing steel cords embedded therein and turned up around a pair of bead cores and a belt layer composed of 3 to 4 ply layers each containing steel cords embedded therein, said cords of which being crossed with one another at an angle of 150 to 700 with respect to the equatorial line of the tyre and superimposed about said carcass ply beneath the tread to provide a strong belt effect.Astheresultof such construction, a radial ply tyre has a tread with high stiffness and less movement of tread rubber, which leads to high resistance to wear of the tread rubber, and by the same reason as mentioned above, the heat generation and the rolling resistance are also very good. On the contrary, in the case of bias ply construction tyres with a carcass composed of several ply layers superimposed on one another and a belt layer composed of several ply layers, each ply of which has its cords crossed with respect to the adjacent ply and disposed between the said carcass and the tread rubber.As the result, the carcass of bias ply tyres is substantially thicker than the carcass of radial tyres and the movement of tread rubber, while a tyre is in contact with ground, is larger than that of radial ply tyre because of the carcass ply construction of textile cords having low stiffness as compared with steel cords.Further, a carcass and a belt layer has to deform together and this causes variation of the cord angles under load which is the so called pantographic movement, which leads to increased heat generation and to lower resistance to wear because of the large movement of rubber. This also increases the rolling resistance. These characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Next, concerning the profile of a tyre, which is generally expressed by the so called aspect ratio, that is, the ratio of the section height to the section width.The merits of low profile tyres are such that the cornering power is increased by the increase in the lateral stiffness with the increase of overall tyre width due to the adoption of low profile see Fig lOa .Accordingly, the maneuverability of the vehicles is improved together with a decrease in the energy loss brought about by decreasing of the radial deflection of such tyres which leads to a decrease of heat generation and rolling resistance. Accordingly, the durability for high speed running and the fuel consumption are improved seeFig lOb .Next, taking consideration of high speed durability from the stand point of material used for the tyre construction, the factors which mainly affect the tyre performance are the tread rubber compound and the cord material of tyres. With regard to the rubber compound for the tread, the material suitable for the tread must be well balanced with respect to the performances of not only heat generation but also the resistance to wear and cut. As is well known, polybutadiene rubber BR and nature rubber are superior to SBR in heat generation and the larger the particle of carbon black as filler for reinforcement the lower the heat generation. It is also known that when the volume of carbon black filler in the rubber compound increases, the heat generation increases.As to the heat resistance of the cord materials for the carcass, it is known that steel cords show the best performance in the order of steel, polyester, nylon and rayon.As will be understood from the summary above, research works for the betterment of high speed running durability of tyres have resulted in big range switching over in tyre construction, from bias to radial, from normal aspect ratio tyres to low profile tyres, from rayon to nylon, from nylon to polyester and from polyester to steel which has caused a big advancement of the high speed durability in accordance with these changes. However, lately with the remarkable improvement of road situations such as the development of expressway networks and the like, the chances to drive at high speed have increases all the demand for tyres having long life has become more conspicuous for economic reasons. However, according to the prior art of tyre design, the high speed performance has been increased only with sacrificing the wear life. Alternatively in the prior art the wear life has only been increased with a sacrifice in the high speed performance.Hitherto in both there has only been such antinomic design activity in tyres.For example, in order to increase the durability at high speed, the thickness of the tread has been designed to be as thin as possible to decrease the heat generation. Accordingly, the wear life of such tyres become short as an inevitable consequence.However, the users of tyres cannot be satisfied with such unbalanced tyre performance for any length of time, the requirement for well balanced tyre properties, which give a long life and an improved high speed durability has become conspicuous of late. That is, it is required to increase the durability of such tyres together with an increase in the depth of longitudinal main grooves and the thickness of the tread.As above mentioned the prior art is unable to provide so well balanced an improvement with simultaneous increase in the durability at high speed and resistance to wear long life .However, the inventors of the present invention have made various investigations into tread patterns which can decrease the heat generation of tyre as well as being superior in the resistance wear.Generally, it is known that the temperature generated, while a tyre is in rotation, is highest at both shoulder parts of the tyre. The inventor of this invention, selected for investigation seven items such as a ratio between surface area of cut grooves at the shoulder parts, shape index cross sectional area of loaded tyre free surface area , pattern transverse stiffness, pattern circumferential stiffness, volume of cut groove, shoulder gauge and tread radius as factors of temperature rise and examined the correlation between temperature and the above factors using multiple regression analysis. He discovered that volume of cut groove and pattern circumferential stiffness greatly contribute to temperature rise.Accordingly the present invention provides a pneumatic tyre in which the rubber surface of the tyre tread is divided by at least two longitudinal main grooves extending in the circumferential direction of the tyre in the pattern of zigzag or wavy line to provide a tread crown part having a width corresponding to about 30 to 65 of the tread width and centering at the equatorial plane of the tyre and tread shoulder parts lying on either side of the said tread crown part, one or more central ribs or rows of central blocks comprising blocks of various shapes are provided in the said crown part and outer ribs or outer rows of blocks in both shoulder parts, a plurality of narrow cut grooves extending in the axial direction of the tyre being provided for ribs or blocks on both said shoulder parts to provide a circumferential stiffness index of the pattern and a volume index of the cut groove of 30 to 70 and 2.5 to 15, respectively. The definitions of 11pattern stiffness and volume index of the cut groove are as follows Pattern stiffness indexIn said shoulder parts, pattern stiffness which is pattern stiffness in contact length with ground under specified load and inner pressure, is defined by below equations.EMI5.1 kp pattern stiffness kg mm F tangential force at grounding surface kg y variation of pattern mm h pattern depth mm E elastic modulus at elongation of tread rubber kg mm2 G shearing modulus E 3 kg mm2 I secondary moment at block section mum4 I ab3112 in the block shown in Fig 11A sectional area of block mm2 In the case of actual pattern, the pattern depth is different from the hl of cut groove in the shoulder parts and several number of blocks are adopted, so it is treated follow, the pattern stiffness at tread surface,Kps Kpsl Kps2 ...

The crown part CR also includes at both sides circumferentially extending longitudinal narrower grooves gl and 92 and sub grooves m and n extending between the longitudinal main grooves G1, G2 and between the main groove G1, G2 and the narrow groove gl, 92 to communicate with each other so as to form rows of blocks Bl, B2 and B3 in the crown part, each row of blocks being approximately parallelogrammatic blocks B. The shoulders S H of the tyre tread lie outside the main grooves G1 and G2 and include a plurality of cuts S in the circumferential direction of the tyre at equal pitches P of 15 mm and at inclination angle Ok of 30 degrees with respect to the equatorial plane of the tyre. The width t and depth hl of the cuts S are 2 mm and 13 mm respectively and the depth hO of the longitudinal main grooves G1 and G2 is to be that of extra heavy tread type. For example, a depth ranging from 16.6 mm to 20.6 mm is adopted to the tyre of 10.00 R 20 in size. In the present example, a depth is set at 18.00 mm. A width GW of the groove G in the U shape at cross sectionA2 A2 is 14.5 mm. A longitudinal narrow groove g is 18 mm depth and 9.5 mm width a sub groove m is 5 mm width and 11 m depth and another sub groove n is 2 mm width and 9 mm depth.In the exampleNo 1 shown in Fig 1 the pattern stiffness index and cut groove volume index are 64 and 10.5 respectively.On the other hand, control examples 1 and 2 according to the prior art were made for trial. The specifications of test samples are listed in Table 4.All above said test samples were 10.00 R 20 14 PR in size and tyre construction except for the tread pattern and the component materials were of the same specification.

From these results various conclusions may be drawn. To begin withFig 5 graphically shows the relation between pattern circumferential stiffness at the shoulder part and temperature, wherein the lower the circumferential stiffness, the lower the temperature at the shoulder part. Fig 6 shows a relation between the volume of cut groove and temperature, wherein the larger the volume of cut groove, the lower the temperature, but as regards an embodiment of this invention, it can be fully understood that even when the volume of cut groove is equal to that of the conventional tyre, a temperature is nearly 200C lower than that in the conventional tyre.A comparison of transverse stiffness with circumferential one of a pattern indicates that, as shown in Fig 8, a temperature in the pattern No 4 having transverse stiffness lower than circumferential stiffness as shown in Fig 7 is 111Or, degrees which is not low at all.Incidentally, circumferential stiffness per pitch in the pattern No 4 was 44.0 whereas transverse stiffness was 25.2. From the above fact, it has been shown that lowering of temperature must depend on a reduction of circumferential stiffness rather than transverse one.Fig 4 graphically shows that the relation between the tread gauge at the shoulder parts and temperature in the tyre, wherein a temperature rises with the increase in tread gauge in conventional tyre but, in the embodiment of this invention Fig 1 , despite the shoulder gauge of 23.8 mm, the temperature of the tyre is as low as that of the conventional tyre having the tread gauge of 18 to 19 mm.It is supposed that lowering of stiffness of the pattern depending on pattern effect leads to decrease in resistance of the tyre to wear. However, in this respect, Fig 9 shows that values of pattern stiffness of tyres shown in Fig 1 and Fig 3aare 15.6 and 7.7 respectively, that is 1 0.5 in terms of ratio, and volumes of cut grooves are 4.16 cm3 and 14.4 cm3 respectively, that is 1 3.5 in ratio. In the pattern shown in Fig 1 the volume of groove is small in proportion to pattern stiffness Fig 9 as compared with that shown in Fig 3a. That is to say, it has been found that when reducing pattern stiffness, resistance to wear is reduced with the increase in volume of the cut groove and, therefore, by setting narrow the width t of cut in the shoulder part as in the pattern shown in Fig 1, control over temperature rise and prevention of decrease in resistance to wear are ensured.An appropriate width t of a cut S is from 0.5 to 5 mm, more preferably from 1 to 3 mm.A volume index of the cut is preferably within the range from 2.5 to 15. An index exceeding 16 results in too large volume of the cut which accelerates wear of rubber and further unfavourably generates noise or collects pebbles. On the other hand, too small an index not exceeding 2.4 degrades wet grip and causes resultant problems in safety of vehicles. An index of circumferential stiffness is preferably from 30 to 70 but because when being low such as not greater than 29, causes the rubber block to tend to chip off and, being 71 or higher, invites problem in generation of heat. Provision of a plurality of cut grooves for adapting the circumferential stiffness index to range from 30 to 70 improves ground contacting performance of the tread and reduces the wear of tyre occurring during slippage, thereby the so called shoulder wear being markedly eliminated.The test of durability to high speed running for the said sample tyres was performed according to the following method and the results thereof are shown in Table 5.

The tyre of Control example 2 which sacrificed resistance to wear, cleared a speed of 130 km h because of lower heat generation due to reduced pattern circumferential stiffness. The tyre according to the present invention designed to be provided with cut grooves on the shoulder zones for reducing pattern circumferential stiffness, controlled heat generation of durability. As regards resistance of the tread to wear, comparison tests using a truck were performed and amounts of wear of tread rubber per 1,000 km running were compared by measurements of remaining groove depth after 50,000 km running. As shown in Table 6, a tyre Example 1 according to the present invention demonstrated an excellent resistance to wear by the contribution of heat generation to a low degree as above described, more uniform distribution of ground contact pressure and high grip performance. Table 6 Index of Wear of Tread RubberControl example 1 100Control example 2 80Example 1 105 Note The larger the index number, the better the resistance to wear. The above index number may be regarded as a ratio between wear life span of treads.Values obtained from comparison of wet grip performances are shown in Table 7.

In this case too, the larger the index number the better the performance and the tyre Example 1 according to the present invention which exhibited a strong braking force was verified to be excellent in wet grip performance as one of important requirements for safety of a truck.Thus, as has been described, the invention provides a well balanced tyre in which a plurality of narrow cut are disposed on both shoulder parts, where the heat generation is most remarkably low for a tyre.The low heat generation is by means of decreasing the pattern stiffness so that the high speed durability is improved in spite of the extra heavy tread with deepest longitudinal main grooves and wear life of tread, wandering performance including wet grip performance, ride feeling and handling stability can simultaneously and effectively improved in well balanced manner.
