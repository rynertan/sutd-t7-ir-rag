## Description
method for Preparing Flexible Polyurethane Foam . This invention relates to the preparation of flexible polyurethane foams employing certain gel catalysts to obtain polyurethane foams having high levels of oxidative stability and resiliency relative to products obtained using conventional organotin catalysts with compounds containing phosphorus and halogen. Flexible polyurethane foams are widely used in the manufacture of furniture, particularly seat cushions, and as packaging material for delicate instruments and other articles that are susceptible to damage during handling and transit. If the foam is incorporated into a piece of furniture or other durable product, the foam must withstand exposure of several years or longer to elevated temperatures, atmospheric oxygen, or both without undergoing significant degradation, resulting in a gradual loss of resiliency and structural strength which may culminate in disintegration of the foam. It is known to prepare flexible cellular polyurethanes by reacting polyols containing two or more reactive hydrogen atoms, as determined by theZerewitinoff method, with polyfunctional isocyanates in the presence of a polymerization or gel catalyst and a blowing agent such as water or a relatively low boiling fluorocarbon. A surfactant is often included in the reaction mixture together with a blowing catalyst to obtain the desired uniformly small cell size within the foam when water is used as the blowing agent. U.S. Patent Specification 3,620,985 discloses that organotin compounds are effective gel catalysts for cellular polyurethanes. Compounds of the general formula RaSnXb, wherein R is typically butyl or other alkyl radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is halogen or other anionic radical and a and b are integers and a b 4, are less than satisfactory for preparing flexible foams that are exposed to atmospheric oxygen, elevated temperatures, i.e. above about 500C, or both over extended periods of time.Under these conditions the foams may lose resiliency and structural integrity, sometimes to the extent that they disintegrate when compressed. This is particularly true for those foams derived from polyols that are reaction products of propylene oxide and glycerine.These polyols may also contain end groups derived from ethylene oxide to obtain hydroxyl groups bonded to primary rather than secondary carbon atoms. High resiliency polyurethane foams derived from polyols that contain side chains obtained by the graft polymerization of acrylonitrile, styrene or other vinyl monomer onto a poly propylene oxide backbone are usually less susceptible to oxidative and thermal degradation. Ho vever, in the presence of conventional organotin gel catalysts e 9 en these products undergo a significant decrease in structural strength and become brittle following prolonged exposure to oxygen and or heat. The resistance of flexible polyurethane foams to oxidatively and thermally induced degradation can be improved by employing a phosphorus compound and a halogen compound in combination with an organotin gel catalyst. catalyst compositions of this type are disclosed in United States Patent Specifications 3,067,149 4,048,100 4,052,346 and British PatentSpecification 1,003,201. This type of catalyst composition may be suitable for certain applications where high resiliency is not a requirement, since typical foams prepared using these catalyst compositions recover only a small fraction of their original height within 30 minutes after being compressed to 10 of their original height for 22 hours atria temperature of 70 C. An objective of this invention is to improve the recovery properties of flexible polyurethane foams prepared using gel catalyst compositions contain an organotin compound, phosphorus and a halogen.Surprisingly it has now been found that if tin, phosphorus and halogen are chemically combined in a single molecule the resultant foam exhibits improved stability at elevated temperatures relative to a foam prepared using the organotin compound as gel catalyst in the absence of phosphorus and halogen and, in addition, exhibits excellent recovery following prolonged compression. This invention provides a method for preparing a flexible polyurethane foam exhibiting improved resiliency and resistance to heat induced degradation by reacting a polyether type polyol containing at least two active hydrogen atoms per molecule, as determined by the Zerewitinoff method, with a polyfunctional isocyanate, the reaction being conducted in the presence of a blowing agent and a catalytically effective amount of a gel catalyst.The invention is characterised in that the gel catalyst comprises a compound containing in chemically combined form tin, phosphorus and a halogen, the compound containing from 3 to 4056 by weight of tin, from 2 to 20F6 by weight of phosphorus and from 3 to 70 by weight of halogen, based on the weight of the catalyst, and being a mono or diorganotin ester of a phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, phosphonic acid, phosphinic acid, thiophosphorous acid or phosphoryl chloride. In many of the gel catalysts the amount of tin will not be more than 30 by weight. The present gel catalysts are useful for preparing flexible polyurethane foams from substantially all of the known polyether polyols, polyfunctional isocyanates and blowing agents. The concentration of the gel catalyst is usually from 0.005 to 1 , based on the weight of polyol. The present catalysts are organotin esters of phosphoric, phosphorous, thiophosphorous, phosphinic or phosphonic acid or phosphoryl chloride. Phosphoryl chloride is, in turn, a derivative of phosphoric acid.The organotin moiety R2Sn or RSn can be the only esterifying group present on the phosphoruscontaining acid. Alternatively, the catalyst may be a mixed ester obtained by reacting an organotin halide or an organotin oxide or hydroxide with the desired phosphorus containing ester derived from an alcohol or phenol. As used herein the term halogen refers to chlorine, bromine and iodine. All of the present catalysts contain at least one chlorine, bromine or iodine atom that is bonded to tin, phosphorus or the hydrocarbon portion of an alcohol or phenol residue that is in turn, bonded to a phosphorus or a tin atom. Preferably the said compound is chosen from compounds having the general formulae EMI5.1 EMI6.1 EMI6.2 III wherein R is hydrocarbyl, haloalkylEMI6.3 R2 is hydrocarbyl, haloalkyl, halogen or oR5 whereinR5 is hydrocarbyl or haloalkyl, R3 is alkyl containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl or phenyl, R4 is CH2CH2 or CH CH3 CH2 , X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, Y is oxygen or sulphur, a and d are each 1 or 2 and b and e are each 0, 1 or 2 with the provisos that i the tin atom is always bonded to 4 atoms and ii the said compound always contains at least one chlorine, bromine or iodine bonded to tin, carbon or phosphorus, and c is 0 or 1. R1, R2 and R3 may, for instance, be chosen from alkyl groups contaning 1 8 carbon atoms Rê may be alkoxy containing 1 8 carbon atoms, or ss chloroethyl or Rê may be chlorine with c being 1. The term hydrocarbyl includes alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl and alkaryl groups. Any alkyl group and any haloalkyl group contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and the preferred aryl group is phenyl. Organotin esters of phosphorus containing acids and organic esters thereof are reported in the chemical literature. These compounds may be prepared by reacting an organotin oxide or hydroxide with an organic ester of the desired phosphorus containing acid under conditions conventionally employed for transesterification reactions and in the presence of a liquid hydrocarbon that forms an azeotropic mixture with the alcohol formed as a by product of the transesterification reaction. Alternatively, the desired organotin halide can be reacted with the sodium salt of the phosphorus containing acid or a partial ester thereof. If the final compound contains a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom bonded to tin, the corresponding organo hyeroxyhalostannane can be employed as the organotin reactant. An example of this class of compounds is butylchlorodihydroxystannane C4NSnCl OH 2 This class of compounds is disclosed in United StatesPatent Specification 3,758,535, the pertinent sections of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The accompanying examples disclose procedures for preparing various classes of catalysts that are useful in accordance with the present method. Specific compounds that are within the scope of this invention are represented by the formulaeEMI7.1 EMI8.1 C4H9Sn Cl OP OC2H5 2 2C4H9Sn Cl2 OP OC2H5 2C4H9Sn Cl OH OP OC2H5 2C4H9Sn Cl2 H2PO4C4H9Sn Cl H2PO4 2 C4H9 2Sn Cl H2PO4 EMI9.1 C4H9 2Sn Cl CPO C6H5 2EMI9.2 Cl2Sn OP OC2H5 2 2 C4H9 2Sn Cl SP OC2H5 2EMI9.3 Flexible polyurethane foams of improved oxidative stability may be prepared by reacting a polyfunctional isocyanate with a polyether polyol containing two or more reactive hydrogen atoms as determined by the Zerewitinoff method. In accordance with the present method, this reaction is catalyzed by one of the organotin compounds as defined in this invention. This reaction is usually exothermic and occurs concurrently with gas evolution, resulting in formation of a cellular structure.The gas evolving or blowing agent can be water, with reacts with excess polyfunctional isocyanate to yield carbon dioxide.Water can be used in combination with a volatile liquid fluorocarbon such as trichlorofluoromethane. hen water is present as a blowing agent the reaction mixture may also contain a catalyst for the blowing or foaming reaction to achieve the coordination between the foaming and polymerization reactions that is required to retain the structural integrity of the foam and achieve the desired uniformly small cell size within the foam. Tertiary amines such as N, N dimethylamino ethyl ether and triethylene diamine are preferred blowing catalysts. One to five tenths of one part by weight of blowing catalyst is usually employed for every one hundred parts of polyol. Silicon compounds, particularly reaction products of silanes with 1,2 olefin oxides, are often included as cell modifying agents. If one or more amines are employed as blowing catalyst, such will also catalyze the redaction between the polyfunctional isocyanate and polyol. The use of amines as gel catalysts is well known in the prior art however, amines are often less than satisfadtory due to their low catalytic activity. In the past it was necessary to employ a prepolymer in order to attain the desired molecular weight while avoiding unduly long rise tines. The polyfunctional isocyanates used to prepare polyurethanes using the present gel catalysts include both polylsocyanates and polyisothiocyanates and the terms isocyanate and polyisocyanate l are used herein to include isothiocyanates and polyisothiocyanates respectively . While the invention is described with specific references to the reaction of certain diisocyanates, it is generically applicable to the reaction of any compound containing two or more N C G radicals wherein G is oxygen or sulphur.Compounds within this generic definition include polyisocyanates and polyisothiocyanates of the formulaR6 NCG x in which x is 2 or more. R can be alkylene, substituted alkylene, arylene, substituted arylene or other divalent hydrocarbon radical that may optionally contain one or more aryl NCG bonds and one or more alkyl NCG bonds. Although a variety of organic polyisocyanates containing 3 or more isocyanate radicals per molecule can be used in the practice of this invention, diisocyanates are usually preferred in flexible foam formulations. Suitable isocyanates include alkylene diisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, and decamethylene diisocyanate, the lsomerlc toluene diisocyanates and naphthalene diisocyanates, .4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and mixtures of two or more of the foregoing diisocyanates. Triisocyanates obtained by reacting 3 moles of an arylene diisocyanate for each mole of a triol, e.g., the products formed from 3 moles of tolylene diisocyanate and 1 mole of hexane triol may also be present in the reaction mixture. A preferred polyisocyanate is a mixture containing 80 by weight of the 2,4 isomer and 20 percent of the 2,6 isomer of toluene diisocyanate,Other suitable polyfunc tional isocyanates include hexamethylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, 1 methyl 2,4 diisocyanatocyclohexane, phenylene diisocyanates, chlorophenylene diisocyanates, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, naphthalene 1,5 diisocyanate, triphenylmethane 4,4 ,4 triisocyanate and xylene alpha , alpha diisothiocyanate. Oligomeric and polymeric isocyanates containing at least two isocyanate or isocyanate groups are also useful in the present method, as are compounds of the general formula M NCG x wherein x is 2 or more and M is a difunctional or polyfunctional atom or group and G is as defined above. Examples of this type include ethylphosphonic diisocyanate, CzH5P O NCO 2, phenylphosphinic diisocyanate, CsH5P NCO 2, compounds containing a Si NCG group, isocyanates derived from sulphonamides containing S02NCO groups , cyanic acid, and thiocyanic acid. Suitable polyether type polyols include polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols. The molecular weight of these compounds is preferably between about 200 and 5000. The preparation of polyether based urethane foams can be carried out by forming a prepolymer, 1. e. prereacting molar equivalents of the hydroxylterminated polyether and isocyanate in the absence of water and thereafter producing a foam by the addition of excess isocyanate, water and optionally other blowing agents and one of the present gel catalysts.In such a method of operation the prepolymer may itself be regarded as the polyether polyol.Alternatively, foams may be produced by the one shot method in which all of the reactants and catalysts are mixed together and allowed to react in the presence of water or other blowing agent. The polyfunctional isocyanate is typically present in an amount of 5 to 300 percent, preferably from 30 to 50 percent by weight of the polyol. Water may optionally be present as a blowing agent to react with excess isocyanate and generate sufficient carbon dioxide to produce a foam of the desired density. The amount of water is between 1 and 10 percent, preferably between 3 and 5 percent, based upon the weight of the polyol. The amount of isocyanate used can be in excess of the stoichiometric amount required to react with the active hydrogen atoms present xn the polycl and any water present, thereby forming allophanateEMI14.1 and biuretEMI14.2 linkages in the polymer chains. Depending upon the desired density of the urethane foam and the amount of crosslinking desired, the ratio of isocyanate equivalents to equivalents of active hydrogen should be from 0.8 to 1.2, respectively, preferably between 0.9 and 1.1. The gel catalyst and one or more blowing catalysts are present in an amount corresponding to from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol.Preferably the gel catalyst is present in an amount corresponding to between 0.005 and 1.0 part by weight per 100 parts of polyol.

The compounds described in the preceding nine preparations were employed as gel catalysts for flexible polyurethane foams using the following formulation Ingredient Parts by weight Polyol 100 Water 3.5 Poly oxyethyl ene oxypropylene siloxane 1.0 Blowing catalyst 0.45 Gel catalyst as specified Toluene diisocyanate 45.5. The above polyol was an ethylene oxidepropylene oxide copolymer available as Niax 16 56 from the Union Carbide Corporation. Niax is a TradeMark. The above blowing catalyst was a mixture containing 0.15 part of a commercially available tertiary amine blowing catalyst Polycat 77, distributed by Abbot Laboratories and O. 0 part of triethylene diamine as a 33 solution in dipropylene glycol . Polycat is a Trade Mark. The index of the above toluene diisocyanate was 105. The reagents were blended for five seconds using a high speed mixer and then poured into a one litre capacity polyethylene lined paper cup and allowed to rise. Each of the resultant cylindrical foam samples was cut in half lengthwise and one of the halves was tested for oxidative and thermal stability in accordance with the procedure set forth in the AmericanSociety for Testing and Materials ASTM Test MethodD 1564 71 suffix A . The sample to be tested was placed in a circulating air oven at a temperature of 1400C for 22 hours, then withdrawn from the oven and allowed to cool for between 10 and 15 minutes. A portion of the flat surface of each sample was depressed to the maximum extent and the pressure released almost immediately.Samplers that were sufficiently resilient to recover their original Shape without any visible damage were considered to have passed the test and all others were considered failures. The procedure employed to determine the 90 compression set value is described in the aforementionedASTM test method, and consists of compressing a foam ample to 10 f As original height for 22 hours at a temperature The height of the foam sample is measured prior to compression and thirty minutes following release of compression. The 90 compression set value is calculated using the formula 90 ,4 compression set t0 tf t0t5 x 100. In the foregoing formula to is the height of the foam sample prior to compression, tf is the height of the sample measured 30 minutes following the release of coEDression and to is the height of the spacer bar employed in the test procedure described in the aforementioned ASTM method. Polyurethane foams employed in seat cusions and mattresses should exhibit 90 compression set values of less than about 15 . All of the present catalysts evaluated produced foams that were within this range. By comparison, foams prepared using several prior art catalyst compositions wherein the tin, phosphorus and halogen are distributed among two or three compounds exhibited 90 compression set values considerably above 15 and as high as 90 . These foams would not be suitable for use in seat cushions or mattresses. The cream time, rise time, dry heat test results pass or fail and the 90 compression set values for three of the catalysts disclosed in the preceding examples are summarized in the following table together with the values obtained using stannous octoate as a control catalyst.
