# THERMOFORMED SHAPED ARTICLES OF THERMOTROPIC LIQUID CRYSTAL POLYMERS AND METHODS OF PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
Thermoformed articles of thermotropic liquid crystal poly mers and a method of production thereof are provided. The articles exhibit desirable physical properties including dimen sional stability i.e. the articles exhibit minimal elastic recoil upon being subjected to high temperature conditions as well as temperature and chemical stability. The articles also exhibit a high degree of polymeric orientation subsequent to the thermo forming operation which can be retained up to the melting temperature of the polymer since the polymer is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase.
