# A METHOD FOR INTERRUPTING MACHINE OPERATION IN A CNC SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method for operating a computer controlled industrial machine, such as a lathe, in which a machining operation can be interrupted, a tool displaced from a workpiece and the operation subsequently resumed at the point of interrup tion. The method includes provision for interrupting canned cycles, such as threadcutting cycles on a lathe, in a manner to prevent damage to any previously cut threads. In one embodiment, the method provides for retrace of prior ma chining operations before resuming the interrupted opera tion.
