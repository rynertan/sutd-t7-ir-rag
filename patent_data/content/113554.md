# Radially activated thermocouple assembly.

## Abstract
In a thermocouple apparatus the lower end of the thermocouple well is provided with an end cap of a different thermocouple material than the well so that the junction between the end cap and the end portion of the well defines a radially activated thermocouple junction. A wire of the same material as the end cap is affixed to the end cap and electrical connections are made to provide a thermocouple output signal for temperature measurement. In another embodiment two end caps of two dissimilar thermocouple elements are utilized at the end of the thermocouple well to provide a thermocouple output signal.
