# Therapeutic composition having an antibacterial action and made from a fraction extracted from camomile flower, and the process for the preparation of this fraction.

## Abstract
A new lipophobic fraction has been prepared by the extrac tion of camomile flowers with boiling ethyl or methyl alcohol, which can contain up to 30 water, letting the alcoholic solu tion evaporate to obtain a residue and washing the obtained residue with the appropriate organic solvents. This fraction is particular free of any of the camomile ex tract components that are volatile in steam current and the fraction has a strong bacteriostatic and bactericidal action. Therapeutic compositions having antibacterial action were prepared, using the lipophobic fraction of the camomile extract prepared as described above.
