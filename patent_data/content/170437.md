# Improvements in tile manufacturing apparatus.

## Abstract
Tile manufacturing apparatus includes means for form ing green state tiles on pallets 8 . The pallets are then loaded on to racks 30 for curing. The apparatus 5 for loading the pallets on to shelves in the racks comprises pairs of supports 372 which are carried by conveyors 350, 352 . The pairs of supports engage edges of the pallets and the conveyors move upwards to pick up the pallets as they are fed in tined relation to the apparatus by an infeed conveyor 20 which also ensures that the pallets remain level as they are loaded. When the supports all carry a tile, a pusher 382 moves the pallet from the supports on to shelves in the racks.
