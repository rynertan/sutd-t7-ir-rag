# Method and apparatus for melt spinning.

## Abstract
In a melt spinning operation, a heated wash gas such as nitrogen or nitrogen and air is blown across the melt spinning nozzles to remove volatiles thereby preventing wetting of the nozzle discharge. The wash gas is maintained at a tempera ture substantially equal to the melt spinning temperature. The preferred melt spinning material is petroleum pitch.
