# A powder actuated fastener driving tool having a piston.

## Abstract
A powder actuated piston type fastener driving tool having a tilting muzzle bushing 74 to engage the fastener driving face 56 of the piston 52 . After the piston 52 has been driven, the muzzle bushing 74 is displaced manually forwardly, by means of a slide 64 , until the muzzle bushing 74 tilts to a position where it can contact the fastener driving face 56 of the piston 52 . The muzzle bushing 74 is then return ed breechwardly, pushing the piston 52 in front of it back into the barrel bore 36 to a driving position. When the a driving position of the piston 52 is reached, the muzzle bushing 74 comes out of the tilted position into a position where it is coaxial with the piston 52 .
