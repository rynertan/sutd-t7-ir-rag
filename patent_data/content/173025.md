# Internal tube cutting tool.

## Abstract
A flail tube cutter having an elongated cutting head circumscribed by a generally circular cutting blade, a means of rotating this cutting head, and a flexible shaft for coupling the cutting head to the rotating means is disclosed herein. The circular cutting blade of the cutting head inclu des a circumferential serration for defining two cutting teeth. Additionally, the cutting head includes a top portion located above the cutting blade for increasing the impact force of these cutting teeth against the inside wall of the tube being cut. The flail tube cutter of the invention provides a fast acting tube cutter having a relatively small diameter which is easily snaked through tubes having local restric tions caused by either dents or internally mounted sleeves.
