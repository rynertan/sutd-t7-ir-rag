# Method of forming electrical interconnections on contact pads of semi conductor devices.

## Abstract
The method provides an improved semiconductor device having a semiconductor substrate 10 containing solid state signal processing circuitry which comprises doped regions of predetermined resistivity within the semi conductor substrate, a passivation layer 54 covering the surface of the semiconductor substrate with electrical con tacts 12a to the solid state signal processing circuitry exposed through the passivation layer. The improvement comprises forming, on the electrical contacts 12a contact pads 36 which have an upper surface devoid of a de pressed center region. After the forming step, an adhering insulator material 34 is deposited over the passivation layer 54 , and a semiconductor wafer is mounted onto the substrate above the contact pads to form an assembly. The mounting process comprises applying pressure and heat to the assembly so that, prior to curing, adhering insulator material is squeezed out between the contact pads and a minimum thickness of adhering insulator material 34 remains between the substrate and the wafer, and so that the insulator material is cured. Portions of the wafer and adhering insulator material are then removed to expose the upper surface of predetermined contact pads. Predeter mined regions of the remaining semiconductor wafer 36A are then electrically interconnected with predetermined contact pads 38 .
