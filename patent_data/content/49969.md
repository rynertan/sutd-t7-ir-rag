# A master cylinder assembly for a vehicle hydraulic braking system.

## Abstract
A master cylinder assembly comprising two separate master cylinders 1, 2 is disclosed. Pressure spaces 28 of the master cylinders 1, 2 are interconnected through outlet passages 31 and a transfer passage 30 , and a transfer valve 32 is housed within each radial outlet passage 31 . When the master cylinders 1, 2 are inoperative both transfer valves 32 are disposed in intermediate positions in which a limited flow can take place through both valves 32 in both directions. This prevents hydraulic fluid from being trapped in the transfer passage 30 which otherwise might cause a fracture to occur upon expansion with temperature of the fluid. Each transfer valve 32 comprises a valve member 33 which is engageable with a seating 34 . The valve members 33 may be held away from the seatings 34 by the thickness of a film of hydraulic fluid therebetween. In another construction discrete resilient projections 42, 53 are provided either on the seatings 34 or on the valve members 33 to hold the valve members 33 away from the seatings 34 .
