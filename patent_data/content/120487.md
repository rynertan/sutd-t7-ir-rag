# Map display system for vehicles.

## Abstract
In a map display system for vehicles, spot coordinates are preliminarily stored which represent map forming spots and are provided with a coordinate origin of a specified spot, and display coordinates indicating map changing frames are also preliminarily stored. The display coordinate of the present position of the vehi cle is compared with the display coordinate of a map chang ing frame. When the present position reaches the map chang ing frame, the spot coordinate of the present position is com pared with the preliminarily stored spot coordinates so as to extract spot forming a new map centering the present posi tion of the vehicle.
