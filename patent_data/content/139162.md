# Coupling circuit between high impedance piezoelectric signal and utilizing circuit.

## Abstract
The high impedance output of a touch sensitive piezoelectric sensor 10 is coupled directly to the high impedance input of a CMOS amplifier 20 . The CMOS amplifier 20 is protected on its input side by clamping circuits 24,25,26,27 which restrict the voltage swing applied to the gates 32,33 to within the range defined by the positive and negative CMOS bias supply V
