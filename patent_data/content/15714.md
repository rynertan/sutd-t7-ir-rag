# ALKALI METAL THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR

## Abstract
Electrolyte geometry in alkali metal thermoelectric gener ator devices that alters the view thereof seen by cooler con denser regions provides an increase in power generating area without undesirably concomitant increase in radiation heat transfer area.
