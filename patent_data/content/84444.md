# Products and processes for use in planographic printing.

## Abstract
Imagewise differential oleophilicity is formed on a planographic printing member by imagewise photo exposure, generally with a Yag laser, of an aluminum silicate image forming layer, generally of a boehmite hydrate layer such as is formed by contact of anodised or other aluminium substrate with sodium silicate. A print resistant image may be formed by applying to an image surface having image wise differential oleophilicity a selective coating composition comprising an organic pnase, generally in an amount of 90 to 75 by volume, containing film forming resin and that will preferentially wet and deposit resin on the image areas, and an aqueous phase, generally in an amount of 10 to 25 by volume, that will preferentially wet and prevent resin deposition on the background areas, and hardening the resin. Novel selective coating compositions for this purpose include emulsions of 10 to 25 by volume aqueous phase and 90 to 75 by volume of a solution of epoxy or other suitable resin in cyclohexanone or a blend of cyclohexanone and ethylene chloride.
