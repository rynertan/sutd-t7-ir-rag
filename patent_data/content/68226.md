# Diaphragm for water electrolysis.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a new type of dia phragm for use in electrolytic cells for the production of hy drogen and oxygen, which diaphragm consists essentially of fluorocarbon polymers which have been oxidized to im prove the wettability. According to the present invention we have provided a new and improved diaphragm. It is characterized in that the fluorocarbon polymers are present in the form of monofila ments, that only the surface of the monofilaments is oxi dized, and that the monofilaments are woven into a fabric. In a preferred embodyment of the invention the monofila ments have a diameter of less than 0,25 mm in the weft and of less than 0.15 mm in the warp. The permeability of gas in the dry state is from 50 to 1000 1 dm ² min ¹ when the difference of pressure is 200 Pa. Preferably the monofila ments are evenly spaced to effect even size of the pores between the monofilaments.
