# Method of applying a resist pattern on a substrate, and resist material mixture.

## Abstract
A method of applying a resist pattern on a substrate and resist material mixture. Resist materials which are applied in accordance with a specific resist pattern are employed in the pro duction of integrated circuits. It has been found that the addition of a certain type of negative working resist material, namely polystyrene and polystyrene derivatives, to positive working resist materials results in a resist material mixture having an increased resistance to plas ma etching.
