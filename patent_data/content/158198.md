## Description
DNA and Use thereof This invention relates to DNA that produces polypeptides which can be used as reagent in the purification of human interleukin 2 antibody, which DNA is formed by the ligation of DNA bearing the structural gene coding for the peptide of human immune interferon hereafter, human IFN X and DNA coding for the peptide of human interleukin 2 hereafter, human IL 2 , and to the uses thereof. Interferons are proteins produced by the cells of higher animals when stimulated by viruses, nucleic acids, and other agents, these have antiviral, antitumor, and other activities. Interferons are currently classified into three types according to their characteristic properties namely, dl pand Types. f type interferon is called immune interferon because it is produced from immunologically competent cells under those circumstances under which lymphocyte transformation the conversion to blast cells or lymphokine production take place. type interferon is said to have higher anti cell proliferation and anti tumor activities than g type and P type interferon, and therefore so much more is expected from the point of clinical applications. However, due to various limitations, such as the requirement for fresh lymphocytes in the production of type interferon, an efficient production system using natural sources has not been established yet. It is possible at present to obtain large amounts of human immune interferon by culturing the transformant obtained by transformation with a plasmid bearing the structural gene coding for the peptide of human IFN y .

However, it is difficult to obtain large amounts of human IL 2 from natural sources. It is now possible to mass produce human IL 2 by culturing the transformant obtained with a plasmid containing the integrated structural gene of human IL 2 using gene manipulation techniques Nature 302, 305 1983 Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 109, No.2, P.363 1982 , Nucleic AcidsResearch, 11, 4307 1983 . As mentioned above the expression of the structural genes coding individually for human IFN and human IL 2 have been studied independently. The object of this invention is the preparation of a novel conjugated dissimilar proteins that have two different immunological or biological activities. We have made a hybrid protein consisting of human IFN t and human IL 2 by employing the techniques of genetic engineering and have found this protein to have the antiviral activity and antigenicity of human IFN Y as well as the T cell growth activity and antigenicity of human IL 2, we perfected the present invention based on these findings. The present invention provides 1 a DNA made by ligating a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IFN 1 and a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IL 2 to code the peptide of human IFN and the peptide of human IL 2 in a single reading frame, 2 a plasmid carrying a DNA made by ligating a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of humanIFN and a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IL 2 to code the peptide of human IFN and the peptide of human IL 2 in a single reading frame, 3 a transformant transformed by a plasmid carrying a DNA made by ligating a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IFN 7 and a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IL 2 to code the peptide of human IFN t and the peptide of human IL 2 in a single reading frame, 4 a polypeptide comprising a peptide of human IFN t and a peptide of human IL 2, and 5 a method for producing the polypeptide mentioned above 4 which comprises cultivating a transformant transformed by a plasmid carrying a DNA made by ligating a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IFN and a DNA containing a structural gene coding for a peptide of human IL 2 to code the peptide of human IFN and the peptide of human IL 2 in a single reading frame in a medium, producing and accumlating the polypeptide comprising of the peptide of human IFN r and the peptide of human IL 2 in the culture broth, and isolating the polypeptide from the broth. In the present specification, the polypeptide comprising the peptide of human IFN r and the peptide of human IL 2 is called interleuron7 2, or simply ILR 7 2. A peptide of human IFN 7 used in the present invention includes any of peptide containing the characteristic activity of human IFN 7 . For example, human IFN T is originally consists of 146 amino acids, yet the peptide of human IFN rused in the present invention may lack the amino terminal and carbonyl terminal residues or have additional amino acids at the amino and carbonyl terminal, but must retain the characteristic activity of human IFN r. In the present invention, a peptide which lacking the 11 amino acids at the carboxy terminal end is preferred. One example of the structural gene coding for the peptide of human IFN Y used in the present invention is the gene coding for the peptide with a molecular weight of 17000 1000 and antiviral and antitumor activities that was described in Nature 295, 503 1982 , Nucleic Acids Research 10, 2487 1982 , Nucleic Acids Research 10, 3605 1982 ,Japanese Patent Provisional Publication Nos.58 90514 EPCProvisional Publication No.77670 and 58 189197 EPCProvisional Publication No.89676 , Japanese PatentApplication Nos 58 176090 Provisional PublicationNo.59 186995 EPC Provisional Publication No.110044 ,and 58 45723 Provisional Publication No. 59 169494 EPCProvisional Publication No.126230 Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 58 189197 EPC Provisional Publication No.89676 mentions DNA containing the base sequence 1 5 TGT TAC TGC CAG GAC CCA TAT GTA AAA GAA GCA GAA AAC CTT AAGAAA TAT TTT AAT GCA GGT CAT TCA GAT GTA GCG GAT AAT GCA ACT CTTTTC TTA GGC ATT TTG AAG AAT TGC AAA GAG GAG AGT GAC AGA AAA ATAATC CAG AGC CAA ATT GTC TCC TTT TAC TTC AAA CTT TTT AAA AAC TTTAAA GAT GAC CAG AGC ATC CAA AAG AGT GTC GAG ACC ATC AAG GAA GACATG AAT GTC AAG TTT TTC AAT AGC AAC AAA AAG AAA CGA GAT GAC TTCGAA AAG CTG ACT AAT TAT TCG GTA ACT GAC TTG AAT GTC CAA CCC AAAGCA ATA CAT GAA CTC ATC CAA GTG ATC GCT GAA CTG TCC CCA GCA GCT 140AAA ACA GGG AAG CGA AAA AGG AGT CAG ATC CTC TTT CCA GGT CCA AGA 146GCA TCC CAG X 3 I twherein X is TAA, TGA, or TAGI This codes for the polypeptide N Cys Tyr Cys Gln Asp Pro Tyr Val Lys Glu Ala Glu Asn Leu Ly Lys Tyr Phe Asn Ala Gly His Ser Asp Val Ala Asp Asn Gly Thr Le Phe Leu Gly Ile Leu Lys Asn Trp Lys Glu Glu Ser Asp Arg Lys I1Met Gln Ser Gln Ile Val Ser Phe Tyr Phe Lys Leu Phe Lys Asn Pht Lys Asp Asp Gln Ser Ile Gln Lys Ser Val Glu Thr Ile Lys Glu As Met Asn Val Lys Phe Phe Asn Ser Asn Lys Lys Lys Arg Asp Asp PhiGlu Lys Leu Thr Asn Tyr Ser Val Thr Asp Leu Asn Val Gln Arg LyAla Ile His Glu Leu Ile Gln Val Met Ala Glu Leu Ser Pro Ala AlLys Thr Gly Lys Arg Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Arg Gly Arg ArAla Ser Gln C II or polypeptides with equivalent immunological or biological activities.

The codon represented by X in DNA segment VI may be any codon that codes for an amino acid forming a part of the polypeptide VII having substancially the same activity as human IL 2 providing X is neither a codon that specifies Ser nor a termination codon and it may have at least one codon that specifies an amino acid at the 5 terminal. ATG is most preferable as X. The codon represented by Y may be either a termination codon or a codon that specifies an amino acid forming a part of the polypeptide VII having substantially the same activity as human IL 2, and it may have at least one codon that specifies an amino acid at the 3 end. When the codon represented by Y is a codon other than a termination codon including cases where it has at least one codon that specifies an amino acid at the 3 end , the sequence shall have a termination codon at the 3 end. TAA, TAG or TGA are the preferred choices as the codon represented by Y of these, TGA is especially preferable. As for polypeptide VII , any amino acid residue, such which forms a part of the polypeptide having substantially the activity of human IL 2 may be used as the amino acid other than Ser represented by Z. Examples include those shown in Table 1 excluding Ser . Moreover, the polypeptide may have an amino acid residue shown in Table 1, or a peptide made up of several such amino acid residues at the N terminal end. Met or hydrogen are most preferable asZ. The reading frames of a DNA segment containing the structural gene coding for the human IFN Ypeptide and a DNA segment containing the structural gene coding for the humanIL 2 peptide are fused into one frame by ligating. Ligation may be carried out by a known method, such as ligaton of the 3 OH terminal end of one DNA segment and the 5 P terminal end of the other DNA segment with T4 DNA ligase in the presence of ATP. A linker should preferably be used between the two structural genes. The linker may be, for example, EcoRI linker p CCGGAATTCCGG available commercially from New EnglandBiolabs U.S.A. , EcoRI linker p CCGGAATTCCGG , EcoRI linker p TGCCATGAATTCATGGCA and so forth. The linker may be joined as follows an E. coli polymerase I large fragment or S1 nuclease is used to make a flush end at the terminal of one gene, and the resulting flush end is joined with the end of the linker by T4 DNA ligase. To avoid the ligation of linkers themselves, digestion by an appropriate restriction enzyme is required.When an EcoRI linker is used, EcoRI may be used as the restriction enzyme. By using the sticky ends thus obtained, one may obtain a single DNA segment between consisting of the two genes connected by a linker ligated to the genes with T4DNA ligase. A promoter should preferably be connected upstream from the DNA formed by ligating the two genes. The two structural genes connected downstream from the promoter may be in the following order, going downstream from the promotor the structural gene for human IFN r followed by the structural gene for human IL 2, or the structural gene for human IL 2 followed by the structural gene for human IFN t. Although the order of ligation of the two structural genes is not of crucial importance, the promoter must be connected upstream from the genes. A tryptophan trp promoter, recA promoter, or lactose promoter may be used, as the promoter. Of these, a trp promoter is especially preferable. The promoter may be ligated by connecting the initiation codon ATC to the 5 end of the gene to be expressed by using as appropriate linker, and ligating the linker to the 3 end of the promoter. T4 DNA ligase is generally used as the enzyme in this process. The same method is used as that described above. A recognition site for the restriction enzyme shall preferably be provided downstream from the promoter. A plasmid may be used as the vector that expresses the DNA formed by the ligation of these two genes in the host organism, in which case the new DNA is inserted into the plasmid. The plasmid pBR322 from ColEl Gene 2, 95 1977 is most frequently used as the above vector but any other plasmid that can efficiently express this DNA may be used.Additional examples, include the plasmids ptrp 781 and ptrp 771 into which a tryptophan promoter has been inserted. To insert the DNA thus obtained into the plasmid the plasmid DNA must first be made linear by treatment with an appropriate restriction enzyme, followed by ligation of the plasmid DNA with the new DNA obtained above using T4 DNA ligase. A transformant is then obtained by transforming the host organism with the plasmid containing the inserted DNA prepared by ligation of the two genes. The host may be, for example, an organism of the genus Escherichia, Bucillus subtilis, or a yeast, an organism of the genus Escherichia being especially preferable. The above Escherichia organism may be, for example, a strain of E. coli DHl nature 217, 1110 1114 1968 , Journ. ofMol. Biology 166, 557 580 1983 . The host cell may be transformed by the plasmid using the calcium method, protoplast method, or some other method use of the Ca method is especially preferable. One example of a transformant obtained by the above method was Escherichia coli DHl pIFL9906, prepared in Example 1. This microorganism was deposited at the Institute forFermentation, Osaka IFO , Japan 17 85, Jusohonmachi 2 chome,Yodogawa ku, Osaka, 532, Japan under accession number IFO 14331 on March 27, 1984. This microorganism was deposited at the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of IndustrialScience and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and lndustry FRI , Japan l 3, Yatabe machi higashi 1 chome, Tsukuba gun, Ibaragi Prefecture, Japan under accession number FERM P 7567 on March 29, 1984, and this deposit was converted to a deposit under the Budapest Treaty, and the strain has been stored at the FRI under accession number FERM BP 711. A liquid medium is appropriate,as the medium for cultivating the transformant thus obtained this must include a carbon source, a nitrogen source, minerals, and other nutrients necessary for growth of the transformant. The carbon source may be, for example, glucose, dextrin, water soluble starch, or sucrose, while the nitrogen source, which may comprises organic or inorganic compounds, may be, for example, ammonium salts, nitrates, corn steep liquor, peptone, casein, meat extract, soybean meal, or potato extract. The minerals may be, for instance, calcium chloride, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, or magnesium chloride. Yeast extract, vitamins, and growth promoting factor may be added. Medium containing 0.1 calcium chloride dihydrate and 2 sodium dihydrogenphosphate dihydrate is especially useful for production of the desired product. The incubation conditions, such as temperature, pH, and incubation period, may be set as required to maximize the production and activity of the desired product. A temperature of about 20 to 40 , a pH ranging from weak acidity to weak alkaline especially near neutrality , and an incubation time of about 6 to 10 hours are generally preferable. The desired polypeptide is stored in the cultured organisms, incubation, and may be obtained by centrifugation or filtration of the organisms from the broth, followed by extraction of the proteins. The polypeptide may be efficiently extracted by any suitable technique, including ultrasound treatment, lysozyme treatment, or treatment with chemicals such as surfactants. The polypeptide thus obtained may be purified by a known protein or peptide purification method such as ammonium sulfate precipitation, salting out, alcohol precipitation, cellulose column chromatography, or gel filtration. The DNA obtained in Example 1, described later, contains a polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 1. The polynucleotide consisting of nucleotide sequence 8 412 in Fig. 1 codes for the polypeptide represented as amino acid sequence 2 137 in Fig. 2, namely human IFN y . And the polynucleotide represented as nucleotide sequence 425 823 in Fig. 1 codes for the polypeptide represented as amino acid sequence 142 274 in Fig. 2, namely human IL 2. These polynucleotides may have an ATG codon for initiation of the reading frame at the 51 end for their direct expression. This codes for a peptide having Met at the NH2 terminal end. These polynucleotides may have an adequate intercalary sequence to fuse the two independent reading frames for human IFN t and human IL 2 into one. In Fig. 1 the intercalary sequence is nucleotide sequence 413 424. This codes for the polypeptide represented as amino acid sequence 138 141 in Fig. 2. By using ILR 72 according to the present invention, human IL 2 can be refined effectively. And ILR Y2 according to the present invention may be used as an anti tumor agent, etc. As mentioned above, the mRNAs coding for human IFN y and human IL 2 have already been identified independently, and that the expression of these genes attempted, also independently. However, this invention uses a new concept the production of a new polypeptide having two or more different immunological or biological activities by the ligation of two or more different genes. Furthermore, polypeptides having two or more independent immunological or biological activities are rare in nature. Hence, this invention, because it provides a new type of protein, is a pioneering in the field of the protein engineering founded on genetic engineering. Because ILR 72 with this amino acid sequence has the antigenicities of both human IFN and human IL 2, it is useful as the medium or reagent for the series of human IL 2 purification processes comprising the purification of ILR 72 by anti human IFN t antibody, the production and purification of ants human IL 2 antibody with the purified ILR 2, and the purification of human IL 2 with the purified anti human IL 2 antibody. Here, ILR r2 plays a direct role only in purification of the anti human IL 2 antibody, but as no other method such as this exists for the production and purification of unknown antibodies much is expected as a new technology for antibody purification. ILR r2 has the immunological or biological activities of both human IFN t , which plays a part in antiviral action, and human IL 2 which has an ability to support T cell growth.Further ILR X2 of the present invention has natural killer cell activity. The following method may be used to purify human IL 2 antibody. First, the antibody column is made by binding antihuman IFN r antibody and agarose gel beads Bio Rad, Affigel 10 . ILR 2 in the extract of E.coli DHl pIFL9906 is then bounded specifically to this antibody column. Next, rat ascitic fluid or rabbit serum immunizea with human IL 2 is reacted with this IFN t antibody column containing adsorbed ILR t 2. A solution containing ILR Y2 was then obtained by eluting the column with a suitable buffer solution. The anti human IL 2 antibody was obtained by eluting this solution at a salt concentration at which aDEAE cellulose column Whatman Co., Cellulose 52 adsorbs proteins other than antibodies. The ILR t 2 of the present invention has the both antiviral action of human IFN Y and the ability to supportT cell growth action of IL 2. Moreover, the ILR t2 of the present invention has natural killer cell activity, which enables it to be used in the prevention and treatment of virus induced diseases, tumors, and immunodeficiency disorders in warm blooded mammals e.g., mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, sheep, cattle, and human . The ILR 2 protein prepared according to the present invention is of high purity, and so has low toxicity and no antigenicity. The ILR X2 of the present invention may be used as an antiviral agent, an antitumor agent, or an immunopotentiating agent by enteral or parenteral administration as an injection, capsule, or the like together with a carrier, excipient, diluent, or other known and pharmacologically allowed adjuvants. The daily dosage when administered as above in warmblooded mammals should be from about 1 to 100 vug kg, and preferably from about 1 to 10 yug kg. In the present specification and drawings, the nucleotides and amino acids, when indicated by abbreviations, are abbreviated according to the rules of the IUPAC IUBCommission on Biochemical Nomenclature or the conventions currently used in the art. Examples are shown in Table 1. In cases where an optical isomer may exist, the amino acids indicated are in the L form unless otherwise noted.

Mol.Biol. 121, 113 1978 was constructed as the expression plasmid Refer to British Patent Provisional Publication No.2,102,006 . In a separate procedure, plasmid pBR 322 was digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI and AvaI. The recessed 3 ends of sticky ends of the resulting tetracycline resistance gene containing EcoRI AvaI fragment filled with DNA polymerase I large fragment. This fragment was ligated to the PvuII cleavage site of ptrp 601 using T4 DNA ligase, giving the plasmid ptrp 701 Fig. 3 . Next, to remove one of the two cleavage sites of restriction enzyme ClaI present in ptrp 701, the plasmid was partially digested with ClaI. This gave a ptrp 701 plasmid in which only one of the two ClaI cleavage sites has been cleaved. After filling the recessed 3 ends with DNA polymerase I large fragment, the ptrp 701 was ligated with T4DNA ligase to give ptrp 771 Fig. 3 . 2 Construction of plasmid pHITtrp 1101 The plasmid pHIT 3709 obtained by the method described in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication 58 189197 EPC Provisional Publication No.89676 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme PstI to give a PstI fragment containing the structural gene for human IFN t . This fragment was further partially digested with the restriction enzyme BstNI giving a BstNI PstI fragment cleaved at theBstNI site present in the structural gene for human IFN The sticky ends at the BstNI cleavage site were filled withDNA polymerase I large fragment.The fragment thus obtained was ligated with the oligonucleotide adapter 5 CGATAATGTGTTACTGCC 3 TATTACACAATGACGG which was chemically synthesized by the above mentioned triester method and contains the protein synthesis initiation codon ATG, using T4 DNA ligase. In a separate procedure, the human IFN 7 gene ligated with the above adapter was inserted, using T4 DNA ligase into the PstI ClaI site of plasmid ptrp 771 downstream from the tryptophan promoter, giving pHIT trp 1101 plasmid that expresses human IFN r Fig. 4 . t3 The E. coli strain 294 pHITtrp2101 was obtained by using the plasmid pHITtrpllOl obtained above in 2 to build the plasmid pHITtrp21011J. Patent Provisional Publication 59 l86995 EPC Provisional Publication No.110044 .Reference Example 2Construction of plasmid pTFl l i Isolation of mRNA coding for human IL 2 Lymphocytes prepared from the human peripheral blood were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum supplemented with 12 o tetradecanoylphorbol13 acetate TPA 15 ng ml and concanavalin A 40 pg ml at 37 DC to induce IL 2. After 24 hours, 1 X 101 human lymphocytes thus induced were disrupted and denatured in a solution containing 5M guanidine thiocyanate, 5 mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris HCl pH7.6 , and 10mM EDTA with aTeflon homogenizer.Next, sodium N lauroyl sarcosinate was added to a concentration of 4 , and the mixture homogenized, then was layered onto 6 ml of 5.7 M cesium chloride solution 5.7 M cesium chloride, 0.1M EDTA and centrifuged using aBeckman SW28 rotor Beckmann, U.S.A. at 24,000 rpm and 15 OC for 48 hours to give an RNA precipitate. This RNA precipitate was dissolved in 0.25 sodium N lauroylsarcosinate and precipitated with ethanol to give 10 mg ofRNA. This RNA was adsorbed on an oligo dT cellulose column in a high concentration salt solution 0.5M Nail, 10 mMTris HCl pH 7.6, lmM EDTA, 0.3 SDS . Elution with a low concentration salt solution 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 1 mMEDTA, 0.3 SDS gave 300 rg of poly A containing mRNA.This mRNA was again precipitated with ethanol, then dissolved in 0.2 ml of a solution 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA, 0.3 SDS , treated at 650C for 2 minutes and fractionated by 10 35 sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 20 OC and 25,000 rpm for 21 hours using a Beckmann SW28 rotor into 22 fractions. An aliquot of each fraction was injected into oocytes of Xenopus laevis and the IL 2 activity in proteins thus synthesized was measured.Praction Nos. 11 15 sedimentation coefficient 8S 15S were found to have IL 2 activity About 25 pg of IL 2 mRNA was contained in these fractions ii Synthesis of single stranded DNA Using the mRNA obtained above and reverse transcriptase, incubation was carried out in 100 1 of reaction solution 5 jig of mRNA, 50 jig of oligo dT , 100 units of reverse transcriptase, 1 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, 1 mM dGTP, 1 mM TTP, 8 mM MgC12, 50 mM KC1, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 8.3 at 420C for I hour, followed by deproteinization with phenol and treatment with 0.1 N NaOB at 70 C for 20 minutes for removal of RNA by decomposition. iii Synthesis of double stranded DNA A double stranded DNA was synthesized by treating the single stranded complementary DNA thus synthesized in 50 jil of a reaction solution identical to that above mentioned except for the absence of mRNA and oligo dT at 420C for 2 hours. iv Addition of dC tail This double stranded DNA was treated with SI nuclease in 50 jil of a reaction solution double stranded DNA, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.25 M Nail, 1.5mM ZnSO4, and 60 units of S1 nuclease at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by deproteinization with phenol and DNA precipitation with ethanol. The DNA was treated with terminal transferase in 50 1 of a reaction medium double strandedDNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris base pH 7.6, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoC12, 0.15 mM dCTP, 30 units of terminal transferase at 37 C for 3 minutes to extend the double stranded DNA by about deoxycytidinechains of about 15 nucleotides at both 3 terminals.This series of reactions gave about 300 ng of poly deoxycytidine tailed doublestrandedDNA. v Cleavage of Escherichia coli plasmid and addition of dG tail In a separate procedure, 10 lug of Escherichia coli plasmid pBR 322 DNA was treated with the restriction enzymePstI in 50 1 of a reaction medium 10 jig of DNA, 50 mM NaCl, 6mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mM MgC12, 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 100 yug ml bovine serum albumin, 20 units of PstI at 37 OC for 3 hours to cleave the one PstI recognition site in the pBR 322DNA, then deproteinized with phenol.The cleaved plasmid pBR 322 DNA was extended by a deoxyguanine chain of about 17 nucleotides at both 3 terminals by treating with terminal transferase in 50 pl of a reaction solution 10 rg of DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris base pH 7.6, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoCl 0.15 mM GTP, 30 units of terminal 2, deoxynucleotidyl transferase at 37 on for 3 minutes. vi Annealing of cDNA with pBR322 DNA and transformation ofEscherichia coli The synthetic double stranded DNA thus obtained 0.1 jig and 0.5 jig of the above mentioned plasmid pBR 322 were annealed by heating in a solution containing 0.1 M Nail, 50 mM Tris HCI pH 7.6 and 1 mM EDTA at 65 C for 2 minutes and then at 45 OC for 2 hours followed by gradual cooling and the product used to transform Escherichia coli MM294 in accordance with the method of Enea et al. IJ. Mol. Biol. 96, 495 1975 1 vii Isolation of cDNA containing plasmid In this way, about 20,000 tetracycline resistant transformants were isolated. The DNAs of each of these were fixed on a nitrocellulose filter.Based on the amino acid sequence of IL 2 reported by Taniguchi et al.lNature 302, 305 1983 1, the complementary oligonucleotides of the base sequences 5 AAA CAT CTT CAG TGT3 and 5 ACA TTC ATC TGT GAA3, corresponding to amino acids 74 78 Lys His Leu Gln Cys and amino acids 122 126 Th Phe Met Cys Glu , were chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method tCrsa, R. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 5765 1978 1. These oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P at the 5 terminal by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase in 50 l of a reaction solution 0.20 jig of oligonucleotide, 50 mMTris HCl, pH 6.0, 10 mM MgC12 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 50 Ci of 32P ATP, 3 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 C for 1 hour. These labeled oligonucleotides were hybridized as probes with the above mentioned DNAs fixed on nitrocellulose filter by the method of Lawn et al. NucleicAcids Res. 9, 6103 1981 1. Four transformants reactive with the above two oligonucleotide probes were isolated by autoradiography. The plasmid DNA was isolated from each of these transformants by the Birnboim Doly alkali method Birnboim, H.C. Doly, J., Nucleic Acids Res., 7, 1513, 1979 .Then the insert part in the plasmid DNA was removed using the restriction enzyme PstI. Of the plasmids isolated, that containing the longest insert fragment was selected and named pILOT 135 8. viii Construction of plasmid pTFl A DNA fragment having 1294 base pairs was obtained by digesting the plasmid pILOT 135 8 obtained in vii above with the restriction enzyme HgiAI. The fragment was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to form flush ends and the EcoRI linker p TGCCATGAATTCATGGCA ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation reaction was followed by the cleavage by EcoRI to make each end of the fragment linked by single EcoRI linker.Then the fragment was cleaved with the restriction enzymePstI. As the result of these process, the initiation codonATG was then adapted as the initiation of the reading frame of the human IL 2 gene without its portion coding the signal peptide. The resulting DNA fragment was treated with T4 DNA ligase, to join the expression plasmid ptrp 781 cleaved with restriction enzyme EcoRI and PstI Nucleic Acids Research 11, 3077 3085 1983 . The above reaction, gave a human IL 2 expression plasmid pTFl having initiation codon downstream from trp promoter, as the initiation of its reading frame was obtained Fig 5 . A strain carrying the plasmid pTF1 was obtained by transforming Escherichia coli DHl with the plasmid. 2 The Escherichia coli DHI pTF4 obtained by using the plasmid pILOT 135 8 obtained above in 1 to build the plasmid pTF4, and using this to transform E. coli DHI, was deposited at the IFO under ascession number IFO 14299 onNovember 25, 1983. This organism was also deposited at theFRI as FERM P 7578 on April 6, 1984. This deposit was converted to a deposit under the Budapest Treaty, and stored at the FRI as FERM BP 628. The transformant was prepared as follows. Plasmid pILOT 35 8 obtained in 1 above was cleaved with restriction enzyme HgiAI, giving a DNA segment containing the IL 2 gene of 1249bop. This segment was treated with T4 DNA polymerase, then the Cla I linker 5 CGATAATGGCA 3 TATTACCGT which bears an alanine codon GCA and a methionine codon ACT, was attached, and linker bearing DNA segment treated with ClaI and Pst I. Next, this segment was inserted at the Cla I and Pst I sites of the ptrp 771 using T4 DNA ligase, and the expression plasmid obtained named pTF4. This plasmid pTF4 was used to transform E. coli DHI by the method described byCohen and his colleagues Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 69, 2110 1972 , and a transformant E. coli DHI pTF4 containing this plasmid was obtained. 3 Production of the human IL 2 protein E. coli DHI pTF4 obtained above in 2 was inoculated into 50 ml of a liquid medium pH 7.0 containing 18 Bacto tryptone Difco Laboratories, USA , 0.5 Bacto yeast extract Difco Laboratories, USA , 0.5 sodium chloride and 7 lug ml tetracycline as placed in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask. After incubation at 370C overnight on a swing rotor, the culture medium was transferred to a 5 liter jar fermenter containing 2.5 liters of M9 medium containing 0.5 casamino acids, 0.5 glucose and 7 Xug ml tetracycline. Incubation was then conducted with aeration and stirring at 37 C for 4 hours and, after addition of 3 B indolylacrylic acid 25 Xg ml , for further 4 hours.Cells were harvested from the thus obtained 2.5 liter culture broth by centrifugation, frozen at 80 OC and stored. The freeze stored cells 12.1 g obtained above were suspended in 100 ml of an extractant pH 7.0 containing 7 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 M Tris HC1, the suspension was stirred at 4 0C for 1 hour and the lysate was centrifuged at 28,000 x g for 20 minutes to obtain 93 ml of a supernatant. The supernatant fluid obtained above was dialyzed against 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.5 and then centrifuged at 19,000 x g for 10 minutes to give 94 ml of a dialyzed supernatant fluid. This was applied to a DE 52 DEAE cellulose, Whatman, Great Britain column 50 ml in volume equilibrated with 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.5 for protein adsorption. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl concentration gradient 0 0.15 M NaCl, 1 liter . The active fractions 53 ml were concentrated to 4.8 ml using a YM 5 membrane Amicon, USA and subjected to gel filtraction using a Sephacryl S 200 Pharmacia, Sweden column 500 ml in volume equibrated with 0.1 M Tris EC1 pH 8.0 1 M NaCl buffer.The active fractions 28 ml obtained were concentrated to 2.5 ml using a YM 5 membrane. The concentrate was applied to an Ultrapore RPSC Altex, USA column for adsoprtion, and high performance liquid chromatography was performed using a trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile system as the mobile phase. The conditions used column, Ultrapore RPSC 4.6 x 75 mm column temperature, 30 C solvent A, 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid g9.9 water solvent B, 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid 99.9 acetonitrile elution program, minute 0 68 A 32 B minute 25 55 A 45 B minute 35 45 A 55 B minute 45 30 A 70 B minute 48 100 B elution rate, 0.8 ml min. detection wave length, 230 nm. An active fraction was collected at a retention time of about 39 minutes.Thus was obtained 10 ml of a solution containing 0.53 mg of non glycosylated human IL 2 protein Specific activity, 30,000 U mg activity recovery from the starting material, 30.6 purity of protein, 99 determined by densitometry on an SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophorefogramPl. Lyophilization of the above solution gave a white powder. The powder had a specific activity of 26,000 U mg. The human IL 2 protein thus obtained is a peptide for which above mentioned DNA represented by V codes.Example 1Construction of plasmid pIFL9906 expressing the polypeptide of ILR y 2 and production of the transformant carrying same A DNA fragment of about 450 base pairs long was obtained by cleaving the human IFN X expression plasmid pHITtrp 1101 obtained in Reference Example 1 with the restriction enzymes HinfI and HpaI. The DNA fragment was treated with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I large fragment to form the flush ends. EcoRI linker p CCGGAATTCCGG was ligated to this fragment using T4 DNA ligase and digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and ClaI to form sticky ends. In a separate procedure, a DNA fragment of about 450 base pairs long was obtained by cleaving the human IL 2 expression plasmid pTF1 obtained in Reference Example 2 with the restriction enzymes ClaI and PstI. These two DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase and the plasmid pIFL 9906 constructed by integrating the resulting DNA fragment to ptrp 771 See Reference Example 1 1 , Japanese patent provisional publication No.59 44399, and EPCProvisional Publication No. 102, 634 cleaved with the restriction enzyme ClaI and PstI See Fig. 6 . The strain E.coli DHl pIFL9906 IFO 14331, FERM BP 711 carrying the plasmid pIFL 9906 was obtained by transforming Escherichia coli DHi with the plasmid pIFL 9906. Example 2 1 Preparation of supernatant of organisms containing ILR 2 The transformant E. coli DHl p1FL9906 IFO 14331,FERM BP 711 carrying the plasmid pIFL 9906 for ILR t 2 expression was cultivated in 20 ml of M9 medium containing 1 glucose and 0.4 Casamino acids at 37 OC for 4 hours and cultivated at 37 0C for another 3 hours following the addition of indolylacrylic acid 30 pg ml . The cells were collected and washed with NaCl solution.These were then suspended in 0.5 ml of an extractant 10 ml Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 10 ml EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.02 TritonX1OO, Q.1 mgXml lysozyme and allowed to stand at 0 C for 45 minutes, then incubated at 37 C for 2 minutes to lyse the cells. The thus obtained cell lysate was ultrasonically treated for 30 seconds and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm Serval SS34 rotor, Du pondte, U.S.A. for 3Q minutes at 4 C as an extract of the cells. 2 Measurement of IFN t activity in the extract The antiviral activity of the extract obtained in 1 was measured by running a test that evaluates the cell degenaration inhibiting effect on the vesicular stomatitis virus VSV in human amnion derived WISH cells. The IFN t activity was 2 X 106 units per liter of broth. 3 Measurement of IL 2 in the extract The activity of human IL 2 was measured by using aTCGF dependent mouse cell line NKC3 Conference of Japan Immune Society 11,t277 1981 . First, a 50 pal aliquotes ofIL 2 containing sample diluted to various concentrations by two step dilution were placed in flat bottomed microtiter plates Falcon, U.S.A. . Then 50 1 of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum 10 FCS and 3 X104 ofNKC3 cells were added to the plate and incubated at 37 C for 20 hours in a CO2 incubator. Tritiated thymidine 1 pCi was added to each plate and after continued incubation for 4 hours, the cells were recovered onto a glass filter using a cell harvester Wakenyaku Kogyo Japan .After washing, filtration, and drying, the radioactivity of tritiated thymidine taken up was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The IL 2 activity of ILR Y 2 in the sample solution was 13 x 103 units per liter of broth. The activity mentioned above was measured based on the method of calculation described in Japanese PatentProvisional Publication 58 116498 EPC ProvisionalPublication No. 88195 . 4 Purification of ILR 2 The anti human IFN polyclonal antibody was coupled with the water insoluble carrier AFFI GEL 10 Bio Rad Lab,U.S.A. , using the method described in Japanese PatentApplication 58 176090 Japanese Provisional Publication No.59 186995 EPC Provisional Publication No.110044 , 58 176091 Japanese Provisional Publication No. 59 80646, EPCProvisional Publication No. 103, 898 . Five ml of the extract containing E.coli DHl pIFL 9906 obtained in 3 was passed through an anti human IFN t polyclonal antibody AFFI GEL 10 column. After washing the column with 50 ml of PBS 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH6.8, 0.15 M NaCl containing 20 dextrose, ILR t 2 was eluted with 5 ml of 0.2M acetic acid containing 0.15 M NaCl. The eluate was immediately neutralized and the resulting solution was dialyzed at 5 C for 24 hours against one liter of a PBS solution. This treatment gave an ILR T 2 polypeptide of over 80 purity, with approximately 508. Example 3 1 Preparation of the supernatant of cells containing ILR 7 2 The transformant E. coli DHl pIFL 9906 IFO 14331,FERM BP 711 containing the plasmid pIFL 9906 for ILR t 2 expression was incubated in 200 ml of M9 medium containing 1 glucose and 0.4 Casamino acid at 370C for 4 hours. This was followed by the addition of indolylacrylic acid 30 lug ml , incubation continued for 3 hours at 37 C. After collection and washing with saline solution, the cells were suspended in 20 ml of an extractant 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 8, 7M guanidine HC1 and lysed by being allowed to stand at 0 C for 1.5 hours.The supernatant was obtained by two 30 minute centrifugations at 15,000 rpm Serval SS34 rotor at 40C. The supernatant thus obtained was dialysed against 10 liters of Tris HCl solution 10 mM, pH 8.5 and 10mM of glysine Na pH 6.5 at 4 OC for 3 hours, then centrifuged at 15,0QOrpm Servel SS34 rotor for 20 minutes at 4 C to give another supernatant. This was submitted to CM Sephadex C 50 column chromatography pH 6.5 , eluted with 10 mM glysine Na pH6.5 and 0.4 1.0 M NaCl as the extract, and the fractions showing some activity collected. 2 Measurement of natural killer NK activity in ILR 2 The activity of natural killer was measured in accordance with the method by R.B.Herberman and H.T.Holden Adv. Cancer Res. 21, 305 1978 . Human K 562 cells erythroleukemia cell were incubated in a complete minimal essential medium CMEM as target cells and 4 6X1O6 cells labeled by Na51CrO4. Human peripheral blood mononuclea cells PBMC were used as the effector cells. PBMC 3 x 106 ml has been activated by incubating in a CMEM. An amount of 0.1 ml of the labeled target cells 1 X 105 ml was added to 0.1 ml of the effector cells. The ratio of effector cells to target cells was varied as follows 2.5 1, 5 1, 10 1.After allowing these to stand at 370C overnight, the supernatant of the incubation broth was collected and was measured with a 51 gamma counter.
