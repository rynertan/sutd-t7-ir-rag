# Method of producing a patterned kill of a magnetoresistive layer in a bubble domain chip.

## Abstract
A thin magnetoresistive layer 34 , such as permalloy, is blanket deposited over a substrate 10 including a bubble domain film 30 , and is then selectively poisoned to destroy its magnetization except in those areas where thin sensors 22 are to be provided. The poisoned portions of the magnetoresistive layer serve as a plating base for conductor metallurgy which can be used as an ion implantation mask, and for carrying electrical current. This eliminates some process steps which had been required in the prior art, and does not leave magnetic permalloy in those areas of the bubble domain chip where they would adversely affect propagation of domains by ion implanted contiguous propagation elements. This technique can also be used to make bubble domain devices having gapped propagation elements.
