# ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS ABLE TO ELIMINATE INSERTION AND EXTRACTION FORCE ON THE CONTACTS

## Abstract
The electrical connector is adapted for positionning and connecting conductive means such as a board with a printed circuit having conductive strips, and comprises a housing 11 made of insulating material and molded in one single piece. At least one resilient conductive contact member 12 is received in said housing 11 and is in normally closed position being shaped to press against or contact and hold said conductive means 22 . According to the invention at least one portion 14 of the housing 11 is made flexible and cooperates with at least one part of the resilient contact member 12 so as to permit said contact member to be opening upon inserting or extract ing said conductive means.
