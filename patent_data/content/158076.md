# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY HAVING MEANS FOR EMI SHIELDING

## Abstract
A continuous 360 electrically conductive seal between a back shell 30 and an electrically conductive cable braid 46 is provided by a pair of coaxial sleeves 68, 74 , a ferrule 56 , and an annular shoulder 80 , the conductive seal resulting from interference fitting between the sleeves, ferrule and back shell and the shoulder plastically deforming. Outer sleeve 68 is interference fit in ferrule 56 . Inner sleeve 74 has its outer periphery interference fit within the outer sleeve and within the back shell. The annular shoulder extends outwardly from the inner sleeve to define forward and rearward facing V shaped teeth and is comprised of a malleable material adapted to plastically deform within respective teeth extending rearwardly and forwardly from the outer sleeve and the back shell.
