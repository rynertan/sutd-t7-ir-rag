# Improved catalytic hydrogenation of glycolaldehyde to produce ethylene glycol.

## Abstract
Ethylene glycol is produced in excellent yields and selectivities in a process which permits use of mild tempera ture and pressure conditions and comprises catalytically hydrogenating glycolaldehyde to form ethylene glycol in liquid phase employing a homogeneous ruthenium catalyst and a basic promoter.
