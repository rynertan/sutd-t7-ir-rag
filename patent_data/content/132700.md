## Description
PROCESS FOR SOLVENT EXTRACTION USING PHOSPHINE OXIDE MIXTURES The present invention relates to the removal of acidic organic compounds from aqueous solution and in particular to the use of phosphine oxide mixtures of two or more such oxides without the use of a diluent for the removal of lower carboxylic acids and phenolic compounds from commercial effluent. The treatment of aqueous effluent for removal of contaminants and also the recovery of valuable compounds from solution is a most essential part of modern chemical plants. A number of procedures are used such as steam stripping and the somewhat more complicated solvent extraction, the latter technique being largely dependent upon the properties of the compounds to be recovered. The choice of solvent is critical and solvent loss must be minimized. Some organic compounds such as acetic acid and phenol in dilute aqueous solutions are particularly difficult to remove. It is known to extract acetic acid using esters or ketones as solvent. However, the equilibrium distribution coefficient, Kd weight fraction of solute in solvent phase weight fraction in aqueous phase, at equilibrium for acetic acid with these solvents is about 1.0 or less. This low Kd necessitates relatively high solvent flow rates in the extraction process and recovery with these solvents is not economically attractive when there is less than 3 to 5 wt of acid in the aqueous solution. Alternative, and somewhat improved solvent systems have been obtained by the use of certain organophos phorous compounds and in particular phosphine oxides in a diluent. These extractant diluent systems are disadvantageous, however, since the presence of a diluent which is often necessary in order that higher melting point extractants can be used effectively reduces the concentration of extractant and also hinders subsequent stripping operations by volatilizing concurrently with the compound which has been removed from aqueous solution. The use of 100 extractant as solvent without the use of a diluent is therefore desirable but is limited by the melting point of the extractant and the economic operating temperatures at which removal is conducted. In particular the use of neat trialkylphosphine oxides is known but their relatively high melting points require that the removal operation be carried out at above ambient temperatures thus incurring the risk of freeze up during plant malfunction. It has now been unexpectedly discovered that by use of trialkylphosphine oxides mixtures, not only is the melting point at a more acceptable level but that the ability of the mixture to extract acidic organic compounds from dilute aqueous solutions is high. The mixtures provide unexpectedly high extraction coefficients for weakly extracted compounds such as acetic acid. The organic phose with removed compound can be stripped using several methods such as distillation or stripping with an alkali solution. Thus, according to. the present invention, there is provided a process for removing an acidic organic compound selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted carboxylic acid having one to five carbon atoms and a substituted or unsubstituted phenolic compound from a dilute aqueous solution which comprises contacting said aqueous solution with a mixture of 1 at least two phosphine oxides, where a first phoephine oxide has the formula EMI3.1 and a second phosphine oxide has the formula EMI3.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R 1, R 2 and R 3 are individually selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and substituted aralkyl, each having C4 Clog, and the total number of carbon atoms in said first phosphine oxide is at least 15, and the total number of carbon atoms in said second phosphine oxide is at least 17, the difference in the total number of carbon atoms in the first and second oxides being at least 2, at least one said phosphine oxide being present in an amount of at least 5 by weight and not more than 60 by weight, or 2 at least four phosphine oxides, having the formulae R 3PO, R 3PO, R 2R 1P0, R R 2P0 wherein R and R are individually selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and substituted aralkyl, each having C4 Clog, and the total number of carbon atoms in each phosphine oxide is at least 15 and preferably at least 18, said phosphine oxides being present in an amount of at least 1 by weight and not more than 60 by weight. Preferably, the total number of carbona toms in said second phosphine oxide of mixture 1 is at least 19 and the difference in the total number of carbon atoms in the first and second oxides is at least 4. More preferably at least one phosphine oxide of mixture 1 is present in amount of between about 25 45 wt and said mixtures of phosphine oxide has a melting point below about 5O0C. Preferably, the total number of carbon atoms in a second phosphine oxide of mixture 2 having the second lowest number of carbon atoms is at least 20 when the total number of carbon atoms in a first phosphine oxide having the lowest number of carbon atoms is 18, the difference in the total number of carbon atoms between the first oxide and the oxide with the highest number of carbon atoms being at least 6. More preferably at least one phosphine oxide in mixture 2 is present in amount of between about 35 50 wt and said mixtures of phosphine oxides have a melting point below about 2O0C, more usually below about lO0C. While the process of the present invention is believed to be useful with a variety of valuable pollutants or impurities in dilute aqueous streams, it is particularly useful for acidic organic compounds such as carboxylic acids and phenolic compounds. In particular the process is used for removing carboxylic acids having one to five carbon atoms, preferably acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids commonly found in industrial effluents and also phenol. The carboxylic acids may be substituted by one or more halogen, hydroxyl, cyano or alkoxyl groups. Other specific acids which may be removed by the process of the present invention are exemplified by hexanoic, heptanedoic, octanoic, nonanoic, benzoic, succinic, oxalic, malic, lactic, cyanoacetic, glycolic, and maleic acids. Phenolic compounds subject to the instant invention include those substituted by one or more alkyl groups.Examples of phenolic compounds which can be removed from dilute aqueous streams include p cresol, resorcinol, l naphthol, 2 naphthol, o , m and p xylenol and unsubstituted or substituted hydroquinone, phloroglucinol and pyrogallol. The compound or compounds removed from dilute aqueous solution can be present in any low or moderately low amount in the dilute solution, although usually in an amount less than 5 wt and more likely than 2 wt or even 1 wt . The process of the present invention is particularly useful for the recovery of carboxylic acids from paper mill and synthetic fuel oil plants effluents. The process is also valuable for the recovery of phenol from phenolic resin production effluent and in coal gasification.It is believed that the recovery of organic and inorganic compounds which are only normally weakly extractable e.g.Sb, As, Bi compounds can be carried out by the process of the present invention. In the phosphine oxides, when one or more R orR groups are alkyl, preferred alkyls include about C4 to about C18 straight and branched chain alkyls while preferred cycloalkyls include six carbon to eight carbon substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyls. Examples of suitable phosphine oxides useful as mixture 1 include, but are not limited to, tri n hexylphoephine oxide THPO , tri n octylphosphine oxide TOPO , tris 2,4,4 trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide, tricyclohexylphosphine oxide, tri n dodecylphosphine oxide, tri n octadecylphosphine oxide, tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphine oxide, di n octylethylphoephine oxide, di n hexylisobutylphosphine oxide, octyldiisobutylphosphine oxide, tribenzylphoephine oxide, di n hexylbenzylphosphine oxide, di noctylbenzylphosphine oxide, 9 octyl 9 phoephabicyclo 3.3.l nonane 9 oxide, and the like. TOPO and THPO are preferred oxides in a two part mix. While one oxide of mixture 1 should be present in an amount of at least 5 wt and not more than 60 wt , a preferred amount is between about 25 45 wt and more preferably about 35 wt . Although a number of phosphine oxides can be used in mixture 1 it is most convenient to use a two part mix. A particularly preferred two part mix is tri n octyl phosphine oxide TOPO together with tri n hexyl phosphine oxide THPO the preferred ratio for theTOPO THPO mixture is 35 65 wt . However a synergistic effect to give unexpectedly increased Kd values may be obtained with two or more part mixes of the above named phosphine oxide. The phosphine oxides used in mixture 1 are selected so that the difference in the total number of carbon atoms in the first and second oxides is at least 2, and preferably at least 4 and more preferably 6 or 8. Preferably the melting point of mixture 1 is below about 600C which is the usual upper temperature at which commercial effluent solutions are treated by liquid liquid extraction processes. However, it is desirable that the melting point be lower in order to improve the efficiency and costs of the process. A melting point of about 500C is preferable and thus a phosphine oxide mix melting below about 5O0C, and more preferably 300C or 250C, will from a practical viewpoint be selected for use in the process provided its ability to extract the acidic organic compound is acceptable. The most preferred mixture of TOPO THPO in a 35 65 wt ratio melts at about l60C. Examples of suitable phosphine oxides useful as mixture 2 include those specified above for mixture 1 . In addition, the following phosphine oxides may also be used dihexylmonooctylphosphine oxide, dioctylmonohexylphosphine oxide, dihexylmonodecylphosphine oxide, didecylmonohexylphosphine oxide, dioctylmonodecylphosphine oxide, didecylmonooctylphosphine oxide, and dihecylmonobutylphosphine oxide. While all oxides should be present in mixture 2 in an amount of at least 1 wt and not more than 60 wt , a preferred amount for at least one said oxide is between about 1.5 10.0 wt . Although more than four phosphine oxides can be used in mixture 2 , it is most convenient to produce a quaternary mix from two olefinic compounds. A particularly preferred four part mix is tri n octyl phosphine oxide TOPO tri n hexyl phosphine oxide THPO dihexylmonooctylphosphine oxide and dioctylmonohexylphos phine oxide. However a synergistic effect to give unexpectedly increased KD values may be obtained with four or more part mixes of the above named phosphine oxide. The phosphine oxides used in mixture 2 are selected so that the difference in the total number of carbon atoms in at least two of the oxides is at least 2, and may be up to 6 or more. Preferably the melting point of mixture 2 is below about 200C. However, it is desirable that the melting point be still lower in order to improve the efficiency and costs of the process and also provide materials handling advantages. A melting point of less than about 1000 is preferable and thus a phosphine oxide mix melting below about 1000, and more preferably OOC 50C, will from a practical viewpoint be selected for use in the process provided its ability to extract the acidic organic compound is acceptable. Apart from the energy savings obtainable by the use of a low melting point phosphine oxide mixture, other advantages of low m.p. mixtures include the avoidance of diluent to be used so that the phosphine oxides can be used neat, and also the avoidance of the possibility of freeze up during plant malfunction. The low m.p. eutectic mixture of phosphine oxides also permits, by virtue of depressed m.p. phosphine oxides to be used which previously could only be used at increased temperatures or together with a diluent, the latter use frequently complicating subsequent stripping operations. Additionally, a preferred quaternary phosphine oxide mixture 2 prepared from hexene and octene has only about 20 of THPO as compared with a preferred binary phosphine oxide mixture of THOP TOPO which has about 70 THOP.Since THPO is more soluble in water than is desirable, the preferred quaternary phosphine oxide mixture with less THPO is clearly less soluble in the aqueous solution from which the acidic organic compounds are extracted and thus is advantageous over the binary system. However, the principal advantage of the phosphine oxide mixtures used in the process of the present invention is the unexpectedly increased extractability provided by such mixtures. This extractability exceeds that of an equal amount of one phosphine oxide when used alone and thus provides for operational savings in amount of phosphine oxide required to extract a desired solute from dilute aqueous solution. A preferred phosphine oxide mixture 2 may be prepared by reacting two or more olefinic compounds, such as pentene, hexene, octene and decene, with phosphine. The intermediate tertiary phosphine product from two olefinic compounds, such as octene and hexene, is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to provide a four component, trialkylphosphine oxide mixture i.e. R 3PO R 3PO R 2R PO R R 2PO. Depending upon the olefinic compound octene hexene ratio, the mixture may be a liquid at room temperature, e.g. the freezing point of a 70 by weight hexene 30 by weight octene mix is approximately OOC. For practical, handling reasons, the mixture is liquid at room temperature.For example, a nine part mix obtained from hexene, octene and decene has been found to be particularly convenient and effective. The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to examples provided by way of illustration only.Example 1 Samples of solvent were tested for extractibility of acetic acid and also phenol from dilute aqueous solution.Each solvent sample was shaken and mixed with a fixed amount of aqueous solution containing acetic acid. After several minutes the aqueous phase and organic phase were allowed to separate and the aqueous phase analyzed for acetic acid presence. The procedure was repeated with the aqueous phase until all acetic acid had been recovered and passed into the organic phase. The amount, by volume, or organic phase solvent required for 100 recovery is indicated by the aqueous organic A O ratio.

However, in solvent sample 3, the phosphine oxide mixture 65 wt 35 wt of THPO TOPO gives substantially increased ability to extract the acetic acid. Also, in the phenol extraction, sample 4 gives a substantially increased A O value thereby clearly indicating that less organic solvent phase is necessary for 100 recovery of phenol from the aquoous solution.Example 2 An aqueous commercial waste effluent containing acetic and propionic acid in an amount of 6.15 and 1.50 gpl was extracted using a THPO TOPO mixture. The equilibrium concentration for each of the carboxylic acids was measured for different A O ratios.

It is clearly demonstrated that Kd values for theTHPO TOPO mixture are far in excess of the Kd values for theTOPO alone in a diphenyl alkane DPA diluent, for corresponding A O ratios.Example 3 An aqueous solution containing 10 gpl phenol was extracted with solvents having different extractant concentrations.

The next four examples show the use of C8 C6 mixes and also a Clo C6 mix in the preparation of quater nary phosphine oxide mixtures. Example 4 Phosphine was reacted in an autoclave with an olefin mixture composed of 70 by weight octene and 30 by weight hexene. The intermediate reaction products ter tiary phosphines were subsequently oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to form the final product containing a mixture of four tertiary phosphine oxides. The product was analyzed and found to contain 3.9 O trihexylphosphine oxide, 22.8 dihexylmonooctylphosphine oxide, 45.7 dioctylmonohexylphos phine oxide and 27.6 trioctylphosphine oxide weight ba sis . The final product was a liquid at room temperature with a melting range of 8 to 170C. Example 5 Example 4 was repeated using anolefin mixture composed of 60 by weight octene and 40 by weight hexene. The final tertiary phosphine oxide product was analyzed and found to contain 8 trihexylphosphine oxide, 31 9 o dihexylmonooctylphosphine oxide, 42.8 dioctylmonohexyl phosphine oxide and 174 trioctylphosphine oxide weight basis . The final product was a liquid at room temperature with a melting range of minus 5 to OOC. Example 6 Example 4 was repeated using an olefin mixture composed of 30 by weight octene and 70 by weight hexene. The final product was analyzed and found to contain 40.2 trihexylphosphine oxide, 42.6 dihexylmonooctylphosphine oxide, 15.3 dioctylmonohexylphosphine oxide and 2 tri octylphosphine oxide. The tertiary phosphine oxide mix ture was a liquid at room temperature with a melting range of minus 7 to plus 60C.Example 7 Example 4 was repeated using an olefin mixture composed of 50 by weight decene and 50 by weight hexene.The final product was analyzed and found to contain 22 trihexylphosphine oxide, 42.5 dihexylmonodecylphosphine oxide, 28.9 didecylmonohexylphosphine oxide and 6.4 tridecylphosphine oxide. The final product was a liquid at room temperature with a melting range of minus 5 to plus 10 C. The following table 4 illustrates that a quaternary phosphine oxide mixture from 70 by weight hexene and 30 by weight octene example 6 has somewhat improved performance characteristics for use as a solvent extractant when compared with a binary mixture of 65 wt. THPO 35 wt. TOPO, although both the binary and quaternary mixtures are superior to the prior art.

Furthermore, interpolatigns from the acetic acid isotherms, given in Table 4, show complete extraction in 4 stages at A O 2 for the binary mix. 3 stages at A O P 2 are required when the comparable quaternary is used. The following graphically illustrates the extraction characteristics of the quaternary phosphine oxide mixture of example 8 and the binary mixture.
