# Device for measuring wind speed and or direction.

## Abstract
Apparatur for measuring windspeed and or direction with the aid of a sound wave transmitter 25 and a receiver 25 for receiving reflected sound waves, in which apparatus the sound waves 25a are transmitted in a multiplicity of directions, and in which a compilation of the measuring result obtained with each measuring operation gives a mea sure of the speed and or direction of the wind. The trans mitter and or the receiver 25 are arranged to rotate, so that measuring results from a plurality of measuring locations can be evaluated. The transmission lobe 25a is inclined in relation to the axis of rotation of the transmitter and or receiver.
