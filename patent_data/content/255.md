# Improvements in or relating to feedback enhanced web feeding apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with a web feed apparatus including a plurality of rolls 13 16 into which a web 10 is fed with a differential in web tension between the infeed to the rolls and the outfeed to the rolls and in particular to such an apparatus having a feedback function between low T1 and high T4 web tension. The present invention seeks to expand the capabilities of the capstan roll, tension multiplying system by enhancing the ratio of tension multiplication.
