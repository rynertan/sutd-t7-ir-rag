# A SHIELDED HEATING ELEMENT AND A METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME.

## Abstract
A shielded heating element for domestic or industrial use in which an electric heating wire 2 is inserted into a metal pipe 3 packed with an electrically insulating powder 4 , and a method of manufacturing the same shielded heating element. The electrically insulating powder 4 contains 0.1 to 10 wt. of an oxide, thereby suppressing the oxidation of the metallic content of the wire 2 to lengthen the working life and to prevent insulation breakdown caused by heat.
