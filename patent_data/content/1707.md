# A thermally isolated monolithic semiconductor die and a process for producing such a die.

## Abstract
A process for producing thermally isolated monolithic semiconductor dies, the resultant dies and apparatus using the dies. The process comprises forming a semiconductor element circuit in a semiconductor silicon wafer having a SiOâ‚‚ protective layer 19 . Windows formed in the protective layer 19 accomodate contacts 21 . Support leads comprising an adhesive material layer 23 and a layer 25 of a structurally strong metal having a low thermal and high electrical conductivity are formed along paths extending outwardly from the windows to the edge of the wafer. The protective layer 19 and the silicon wafer material are then removed from between the support leads in a region formed around islands 15 and 17 within a surrounding frame 13 . Such a semiconductor die is useful as the duel RMS sensor element of an RMS convertor.
