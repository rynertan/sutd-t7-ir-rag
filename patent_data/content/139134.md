# DEPOSITION AND DIFFUSION SOURCE CONTROL MEANS AND METHOD

## Abstract
The uniformity and reproducibility of doped, deposited, or etched layers formed in a reaction chamber 38 by a reactant derived in part from a solid or liquid reactant source 34 , through which a carrier gas 29 flows, is improved by dynamically adjusting the carrier gas flow so that the ratio of the partial pressure of the reactant and the partial pressure of the carrier gas in the source chamber 33 remains substan tially constant. This is conveniently accomplished by measuring the instantaneous source temperature therefrom, and then dynamically adjusting the carrier gas flow into the system to keep the total pressure of the reactant vapor plus carrier gas mixture 35 in the source chamber 33 at a predetermined value.
