# Method for ladle treatment of molten cast iron using sheathed magnesium wire.

## Abstract
An improved method for adding magnesium or mag nesium alloy to molten cast iron contained in a ladle for nodularizing or desulphurizing the cast iron. The magne sium or magnesium alloy is added in the form of a wire having a core comprising the magnesium or alloy thereof, surrounded by a metal sheath having a wall thickness of at least 1.015 mm, the sheath metal having a boiling point substantially higher than that of the magnesium or alloy thereof, and desirably being steel. The wire is added to the molten cast iron at a speed greater than 18.2 metres per minute, whereby the sheath melts and melting and vapou risation of the magnesium or alloy thereof occurs beneath the surface of the molten metal.
