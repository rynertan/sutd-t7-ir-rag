# PRESSURE CONTACT TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A pressure contact type semiconductor device such as a power transistor or a gate turn off thyristor is disclosed, which leads a current through a conductive member by application of a pressure thereto. The emitter or cathode of the device comprises a number of radially extending finger like island regions close together on the semiconductor substrate and radiate from a central part to a peripheral part thereof. The radial direction length of the semiconductor layers near the central part is less than that of those in the peripheral part, making the occurrence of cathode gate short circuits less likely.
