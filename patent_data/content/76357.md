# Band type strapping machine.

## Abstract
A band type strapping machine comprises a feeding and tightening roller 13 driven by a motor M , an auxiliary roller 23 in contact with the feeding and tightening roller 13 , a cam shaft 36 which is rotated by the motor through a reduction gear 2 and a clutch mechanism C and which has cams 42 to 45 for respectively actuating a rear gripper 46 , a heater 62 , a press bar 48 and a front gripper 49 , wherein the motor is capable of instantaneous change of normal and reverse rotations and has a large starting torque, and an electromagnetic clutch 14 is fined to the rotary shaft 16 of the tightening and feeding roller 13 so as to be movable in the axial direction depending upon increase of a band tightening force whereby detection of the tightening force caused by the movement of the electromagnetic clutch 14 is mechanically related to the engagement or disengage ment of the clutch mechanism C .
