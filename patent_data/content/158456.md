# INDUSTRIAL LIFT TRUCK WITH TRAVEL LIFT INHIBIT CONTROL

## Abstract
A lift truck of the order picker type is provided with an automatic control system for safe guarding the operation against certain conditions. The electronic control system is responsive to an electrical height signal corresponding to the height of the lift fork 32 to regulate or limit the other op erational functions of the truck. A speed control channel 152 compares a speed signal with a speed command signal and produces a speed control signal of limiting value. A travel interrupt channel 212 compares the height signal with the steering angle and interrupts the vehicle travel if the steering angle is excessive. Usually, the high speed lift is cut off when a predetermined height is reached the lowering of the up right 26 is disabled at a predetermined lower limit subject to manual override.
