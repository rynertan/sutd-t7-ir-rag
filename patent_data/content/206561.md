## Description
The present invention relates to diagnostic devices for analyte assay. More particularly it relates to devices and methods utilizing filter means for testing biological fluids to detect the presence of analytes such as bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal antigens and immunoglobulins, hormones, serum proteins, drugs, and the like. The present invention also relates to an improved diagnostic device for analyte assay which includes apparatus for the separation of solid phase materials from liquid phase materials. More particularly, the present invention comprises an improved diagnostic device which includes a container for combining fluid and or solid materials in a convenient, inexpensive manner which can be used to effec tively deliver the materials, either prior to, during, or subsequent to a reaction, to a filter means in the improved diagnostic device. At the present time there are a number of devices and procedures disclosed for diag nosing the presence of such analytes by means of reaction occurring on filters but they are either too complex, costly, inaccurate, time consuming or a combination of such factors. For example, U.S. Patent 3,888,629 discloses a reaction cell having a matrix pad for carrying out immunoassays. The pad serves as the means for retaining the reagents and as the site in which the reaction occurs as one or more of the fluid reagents are added to the pad and pass therethrough to the absorbent material directly below. In addition to the many time consuming steps required to process the pad to determine the results of the test including removing it from the device, such device is essentially limited to isotopic tests. It is not practical for nonisotopic tests such as enzyme linked immunoassays, since the device requires removal of the absorbent pad for view ing. Moreover, certain biological fluids, such as blood sera, contain particulate and or colored matter which tend to remain on the surface of the matrix pad and thus make it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain an accurate reading in nonisotopic immunoassay procedures. Further, by passing the reagents directly through the entire surface area of the matrix pad there is often poor separation of the analyte since the absorbent pad is very thin thereby affording only a very short distance for separation to occur and there is limited concentration of analyte at any location on or in the pad. Efforts to improve such device are reflected in US A 4246339 and US A 4407943 which try to limit the area of the fibre through which one or more of the reagents must pass. Here again, however, there is flow directly through the thin filter to the absorbent material below the filter, again resulting in poor separation and difficulty in obtaining accurate readings when specimens are being tested which contain particulate and or coloured matter which is retained on the surface of the filter. EP A 0097952 discloses a multilayer analytical element for fluorimetric assay of an analyte, comprising a laminated structure, of layers in the following order Another multilayered analytical element is disclosed in US A 4256693, for use in the analysis of blood. It comprises a laminated structure, of layers in the following order It is an object behind the present invention to obviate the problems associated with the known devices, and to provide a device for rapid and accurate analyte assay. According to the present invention, a device for testing for the presence of an analyte in a liquid, comprises an aperture through which the liquid can be introduced a filter comprising a layer of porous material capable of drawing liquid through its structure by capillary action and which includes a reaction zone which receives liquid through the aperture, and which functions to separate the analyte if present from the liquid absorbent means and means for retaining the filter in position beneath the aperture characterised in that the filter includes a peripheral zone and a reaction zone which is adapted to be viewable, and the absorbent means is associated with the peripheral zone, but not the reaction zone, of the filter, whereby liquid is drawn from the reaction zone to the peripheral zone. The present invention provides an improved diagnostic device and can comprise a substantially cylindrical body portion and a removable cap which has a liquid inlet extending into the cylindrical body portion and includes a conical shaped portion leading to a liquid discharge aperture formed therein. A pre filter may be formed either in the liquid inlet or in a pre filter container which can be used with the device. The pre filter container can have a substantially cylindrical body which conforms to and can be inserted in the liquid inlet forming part of the removable cap. The container has an open upper end and an associated removable closure, an open bottom end sealed with a frangible material and, if desired, a pre filter positioned in the container between the upper and lower ends. When liquid is placed in the container, the container may be inserted in the liquid inlet forming part of the cap for the diagnostic device a puncture device associated with the liquid inlet ruptures the frangible material sealing the lower end, thereby allowing the liquid to be funnelled to a reaction zone on a filter placed beneath or below the discharge aperture. Discharge apertures of various sizes can be formed in the removable caps, thereby allowing a particular cap to be associated with a device for a particular test. The novel device preferably includes a reaction reservoir container for removable insertion in the liquid input means receiving inlet, and a support shoulder extending radially and circumferentially about the exterior of the container for resting on the liquid input means when the container is inserted in the receiving inlet, thereby holding the container in a secure relationship in the receiving inlet. The present invention will now be disclosed in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like numerals represent like components, and in which The device of the present invention is suitable for use with any of the conventional procedures used for analyte assays such as isotopic assays and nonisotopic assays such as competitive or non competitive enzyme linked immunoassays, enzyme multiplied immunoassays, enzyme inhibitation immunoassays, heterogeneous or homogeneous fluorescent immunoassays, chemi luminescent and bioluminescent assays, those assays using labeled RNA or DNA probes, and the like. The particular analyte assay test to be used will depend upon the particular analyte and the desire of the person carrying out the test. The only essential requirement for each particular test used is that the device of the instant invention be structured, as discussed below, so as to insure that all fluids and reactants necessary to carry out the test are caused to flow outwardly through the filter means from the point of application onto a localized portion of the top surface of the filter to peripheral portions in the filter and that no fluid passes completely through the filter at the point of application. This critical aspect of this invention results in better separation of analyte since it travels further transversely through the filter means, concentration of all the analyte and other reactants at a localized portion of the filter means resulting in more accurate results, and permits top, bottom, and straight through reading of the filter means to determine the results of the test. Other than this requirement of the present invention, all of the other steps, conditions, reactants, and the like of the various conven tional analyte assays set forth above are those conventionally used in such procedures. The invention can be more fully understood with reference to the drawings in which like numerals represent like elements. The basic operation of the inventive test device can be understood with reference to The amount of liquid used depends upon the test, assay or immunoassay being performed. In any given test more than one type of liquid may be used in a predetermined sequence. For example, a fluid may be used to prepare the reaction zone, then a washing fluid or solvent added, then a bodily fluid specimen and then another washing liquid added, then a reaction indicator fluid or coloring agent added and then another washing fluid added. The capacity of the absorbent means must be sufficient to handle all the liquid used in the test. The large volume of the inventive device allows the user added flexibility in the tests which can be performed. Also an inert reaction zone The liquid input The liquid flows through discharge aperture A unique aspect of the present invention is the combination of the pushing force of gravity and the outward transverse pulling force of the capillary action of the filter means The filter means The apparatus of the present invention is beneficial where chemical reactions typically the immunochemical reactions occur external to the device and the final reactants fed into the filter means for separation of the unreacted elements therefrom. In external reactions, improved accuracy of component addition is possible. It is generally accepted that a longer incubation period can afford more complete reaction and binding of the reactants, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the assay systems that conduct the reactions solely within the filter means frequently are limited in the length of the incubation period. The filter can dry out during long incubation periods with such systems decreasing the sensitivity of the assay. In the present invention, because the reactions can take place externally to the device, much greater control and flexibility are obtained over the incubation period, greatly improving the overall sensitivity and specificity of the assay. In such instances the diagnostic device is used primarily as a separation device to separate soluble components from insoluble components within the liquid specimen poured into the input The device As shown in The filter means It is important that fluid applied to the reaction zone area pass into the filter means and flow outwardly into the absorbent means. Flow of fluid across the top of the filter means must be impeded so as to ensure the chromatographic separation of the bound from unbound materials via capillary action. As shown in A unique aspect of the present invention is the ability to read and illuminate from either the top or bottom surface. Other systems are limited to reading the reaction from either only the top or only the bottom surface and typically require illumination from the same side as it is being read these include filter discs, dipsticks, tabs containing filter materials, devices where the illumination opening and the reading opening are the same, etc. The capability of reading from either surface enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the present invention to different reacton systems and analyzing instruments. A beneficial aspect of the inventive test device is that the reaction zone can be viewed from the bottom. As shown in The liquid impermeable shield As can be seen with reference to The upper face To provide maximum separation of bound from unbound label components and thereby reduce background noise during observation of the reaction, the invention provides for outward diffusion of liquid applied to the filter toward the absorbent material To maximize the contrasting zones, rela tively large quantities of washing solution are required. To promote effective transfer of the relatively large quantity of liquid from the peripheral zone Where the hollow cylinder absorbent material is compressed sponge material, it will be rela tively rigid in its dry state and will become more flexible upon absorbing liquid and expand ing. The additional flexibility permits the absorbent material to expand deforming slightly to accommodate projections The absorbent material makes possible the use of a very large volume of wash fluid. Generally, a more effective separation is obtained when using large wash volumes. In other devices not containing absorbent material, the amount of wash solution that can be used is limited by the absorbent characteristics of the filter material, typically much less than an absorbent material such as a sponge or compressed wood pulp material. While the invention thus far has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment, reference to One common inventive aspect of each of these alternative embodiments is that the filter means Further inventive aspects are that there is an enclosure means A unique aspect of the embodiment of Another novel aspect of this invention is shown by the embodiment in It will be evident from the foregoing that the devices of the present invention can be inexpensively made and thus disposed after being used for one test or, if desired, the device Also, the present device can be used with chromogenic assays such that the test results can be observed by the eye of the user of the device or the device can be used in conjunction with an automated reader such as a colorimeter for determination of the results. As shown in Sample container means Puncture means As can be seen in When it is desired to utilize the test device As can be seen in The sample container Semi permeable membrane or filter While a liquid input means that is integ rally formed with device With a removable cap By having a removable liquid input means or cap Additionally, a removable liquid input means or cap A filter membrane As can be seen in In addition, the embodiment shown in Thus the embodiment shown in Thus, there has been disclosed an improved diagnostic device for analyte assay which in cludes a cylindrical body portion and a removable cap portion having a liquid input means that can include a variable diameter liquid discharge aperture. In addition, the cap portion may have a filter membrane within the liquid input portion thereof if desired or may be associated with a pre mixing container that has a removable cap thereon, a filter internally thereof and a bottom portion which has a frangible membrane thereover for sealing the container. Thus, pre mixing may occur in the container. A puncturing device is associated with the test device and may be placed in the lower portion of the liquid input means with the point downward for storage whereby the pre mixing container may also be placed in the liquid means without the puncturing device rupturing the frangible lower seal thereof. When the device is ready to be used, the puncturing device can be removed and replaced in the liquid input means with the point facing upwardly and then after the liquids have been pre mixed in the pre mixing container, the container can be placed in the liquid input receiving portion of the remov able cap where by the point of the puncturing device ruptures the frangible seal and allows the liquid in the pre mixing container to be funneled by the discharge aperture onto the reaction zone of the filter. Thus, an improved diagnostic device and associated pre mixing container have been disclosed.
