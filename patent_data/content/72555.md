# Rotary apparatus having improved drive means.

## Abstract
A rotary apparatus 10 such as an ore grinding mill, has a wrap around drive means 14 secured thereto for rotating the apparatus about a central axis 22 . The drive means includes a rotor attached to and surrounding the apparatus and a stator surrounding the rotor and coupled to the apparatus by spaced anti friction or journal bearings. Thus, the rotor can rotate relative to the stator yet the stator is supported by the apparatus and the gap between the rotor and stator is maintained substantially uniform at all circum ferential locations along the rotor. The journal bearings include a number of wheels or rollers journalled on an annular carrier for the stator and engaging an annular track on the apparatus. The stator has a pair of legs for coupling the stator to a fixed support to prevent rotation of the stator about the central axis 22 relative to the support yet permit small lateral displacements of the stator with the apparatus relative to the axis support.
