# Process for producing the composition of modified chlorinated resins.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing a coat ing composition which comprises the steps modifying the chlorinated polyolefin resins containing less than 50 chlorine by weight by allowing to react with a resin modified by fatty acid so that it is adapted to be used as vehicles for coating ma terials, printing inks, adhesives, and the like, and said steps en abling to make an excellent coating in weather resistance, adhesion, stability and in other performances.
