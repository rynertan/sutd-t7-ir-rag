# Aqueous lubricants containing dithiophosphates.

## Abstract
Aqueous lubricants and hydraulic fluids contain a dithiophosphate anti wear agent and a dispersant which is formed by reacting an alkenyl succinic anhydride with a hyd roxyamine such as triethanolamine or an alkylene oxide adduct of an alkylamine.
