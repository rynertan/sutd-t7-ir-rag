# SHOT MONITORING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus is used in combination with a gun for monitoring shooting operation, which comprises imaging lens means having an optical axis and removably secured to the barrel of the gun, the optical axis extending substantially parallel to the axis of the gunbarrel, camera means coupled to said imaging means to constitute a video camera unit with said imaging means, a video tape recorder connected to said camera means, and a video display unit connected to the VTR for reproducing the scene taken by the camera unit. The imaging lens means may be physically separated from and optically coupled to the camera means or they may be assembled into a compact video camera. The apparatus is used in combination with a shotgun for monitoring the position of a shot in trap shooting exercise and with a rifle for monitoring the movement of the rifle held by the shooter.
