# Production of thermally stabilized polyester with alkylene carbonates and sodium or potassium iodide.

## Abstract
High molecular weight linear condensation polyesters are stabilized against deterioration by heat by reacting the polyester in molten form with alkylene carbonates in the pre sence of a catalytic amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of sodium iodide and potassium iodide.
