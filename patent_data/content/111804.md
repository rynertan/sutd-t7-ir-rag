## Description
BIDIRECTIONAL INSLJLATED GATE RECTIFIER STRUCTURES AND METHOD OF OPERATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to insulatedgate rectifiers and, more particularly, to insulated gate rectifiers which are bidirectional in that current conduction can be controlled for both polarities of applied voltage via insulated gates. The invention additionally relates to methods of operating such bidirectional rectifiers in an active anode shorting mode to achieve higher switching speeds without the loss of reverse blocking capability or decrease in forward current density, both of which undesirably occur in the case of passive anode shorting. Various forms of insulated gate rectifiers are disclosed in commonly assigned DE A 31 47 075 by B.J. Baliga and entitled AGATE EN ANCED RECTIFIER1. It may be noted that a 1Gate EnhancedRectifier , or wGERECTt, is alternatively referred to herein as an WInsulated Gate Rectifier , or FIG . The two terms are intended to mean the same device. As described in detail in the above identified BaligaApplication DE A 31 47 075 an insulated gate rectifier IGR is a semiconductor device having an insulated gate for controlling current flow between its Dain terminals, i.e., between its anode and cathode terminals.The gate and conduction channel of an IGR are similar to corresponding elements in a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET or, more generically, an insulated gate field effect transistor IGFET with, however, important differences between the two devices an IGR and a nOSFET as described in detail in the above identified DE A 31 47 075. A basic IGR has both forward and reverse blocKing capability with the exception of anode shorted versions as summarized hereinbelow . However, current can be controlled in only the forward direction via the insulated gate. In the reverse direction, the device either always blocKs, in the case of a basic IGR, or always conducts, in the case of an anode shorted IGR. It will be appreciated that, for some circuit applications, this single polarity control capability is a limitation, and that for some circuit applications it is desirable to have devices capable of controlling current flow for both applied polarities. Previously disclosed IGR s may appear to be structurally similar to double diffused MOS DIM05 or tV groove MOS VMOS vertical channel MOSFETs, with, however, an important distinction. In particular, assuming the case of an N channel device, a P or highly doped P conductivity type anode region, not found in a MOSFET, is included. A four layer, i.e., PNPN, device therefore results. Operation also differs from that of a MOSFET, a most significant difference being that the IGR has higher forward conductivity. Considering the structure in greater detail, in a conventional N channel power MOSFET, an N or high resistivity N conductivity drift region forms an extension of the MOSFET drain terminal region. Conduction in such a MOSFET occurs primarily by simple electron current flow through a depletion channel induced in a shield base region by an electric field from an insulated gate electrode, without the presence of excess carriers. Due to the lack of excess carriers, the dOSFET has a relatively fast switching speed. In contrast, in an IGR, the P anode region injects minority carriers e.g., holes into the N conductivity type region corresponding to the drift region of a MOSFET. The drift region of an SCR constitutes what, for convenience, is herein termed an active base region, signifying that conduction in this particular region involves more than the mere flow of majority carriers, e.g. electrons. Rather, during operation, the holes introduced into the region herein termed the active base region recombine with electrons introduced front the cathode, increasing device conductivity. The conduction mode is therefore bipolar in part. An IGR differs from a four layer PNPN thyristor, even though scie forms of IGR are superficially somewhat similar structurally to HOS gated SCR or thyristor structures, and even though an IGR may be considered as including a parasitic SCR.Significantly, in the normal operation of an IGR, the gate electrode maintains both turn on and turn off control of current flow through the device, and the parasitic SCR is not permitted to latch into a conducting state. As also described in the above identifiedDE A 31 47 075, there are various methods by which the parasitic SCR can be inhibited from operating which would undesirably latch the device into a conducting state with loss of gate control . A basic approach is to employ a short between the device cathode region and the adjacent P conductivity type shield base region. For convenience, such a short is herein termed a 1cathode short , and a given device accordingly has a cathode sorting density determined by the relative contact areas of the cathode electrode with the P type shield base region and with the N cathode region itself. In an SCR, a relatively high cathode shorting density relative to the cathode shorting density which would be employed in a thyristor structure is employed.Another approach for preventing the parasitic SCR fron latching into an undesired c urrent carrying state is a structure disclosed in commonly assigned EP 83 103 196.8 by M.S. Adler and ss.J. Baliga and entitled INSULTED GATE RECTIFIER WITH IMPROVED CURRENT CARRYING CAPABILITY . In the structure disclosed therein, the IGR shield base region includes two portions.One of these portions is doped substantially higher in concentration than the other to reduce its resistance to hols, and additionally comprises a deeper diffused region than the other portion. As further described in the above identifiedDE A 31 47 075, to increase turn off speed, shorts between the device anode region and the adjacent N type active base region may be employed. For convenience, these shorts are herein termed 1anode shorts1. Anode shorts aid in improving turn off speed of an IGR due to the bipolar conduction mode of an IGR. In particular, during conduction in an IGR, there are excess electrons and holes in the active base region and, upon turn off, these excess electrons and holes are momentarily trapped in the active base region, prolonging device conduction and therefore degrading turn off speed. Excess holes in the N conductivity type active base region of an IGR exit towards the cathode electrode through the P conductivity type shield base region.However, in the absence of an anode short, there is no similar path for excess electrons in the active base region. The inclusion of anode shorts overcomes this particular shortcoming, with the result that the device turn off speed is enhanced. A disadvantage, however, of anode shorts is that the device no longer has useful reverse blocking capability although, for convenience, it is still termed a rectifier . One device characteristic which is, of course, improved is turn off speed.Another disadvantage is that anode injection efficiency is reduced, and this particular factor results in decreased forward current density. However, it is possible to improve device forward conduction because the thickness of the N conductivity type active base region can be reduced. A structural alternative to conventional anode shorts is disclosed in commonly assigned EP 82 108 864.8 by B.J. Baliga and entitled SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE HAVING RAPID REMOVAL OF MAJORITYCARRIERS FROM AN ACTIVE BASE REGION THEREOF AT DEVICE TURN OFFAND METHOD OF FABRICATING THIS DEVICE. In the structure disclosed therein, highly doped N orN diffusions are interspersed within the P anode region, which similarly enables the rapid removal of excess electrons in the N conductivity type active base region upon device turn off.This for of passive short also, however, results in tne loss of device reverse blocking capability, and decreases forward current density because anode injection efficiency is reduced. By the present invention bidirectional IGR structures are provided which are capable of controlling current flow for both applied polarities via insulated gates. The present invention also provides active anode shorted IGRs which achieve the nigher turn off speed of anode shorted IGRs without the loss of blocking capability or a decrease in forward current density. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide bidirectional IGR structures capable of controlling current flow for both applied polarities. It is another object of the invention to achieve the higher turn off switching speed of an anode shorted IGR, without the disadvantages of degraded reverse blocking capability and degraded anode injection efficiency. Briefly, and in accordance with one aspect of the invention, a bidirectional insulated gate rectifier structure comprises a body of semiconductor material including an active base region of one conductivity type, for example, of N conductivity type. First and second shield base regions of opposite conductivity type, in this example, of P conductivity type, are formed in the body. To achieve a bipolar conduction mode, the shield base regions include at least portions doped higher in concentration than the active base region. The bidirectional IGR of the invention additionally includes first and second main terminal structures spaced from the active base region by the shield base regions to define respective channel portions in the shield base regions extending between the respective terminal structures and the active base region. The main terminal structures respectively include first and second main terminal electrodes, as well as first and second highly doped main terminal regions of the one conductivity type, in this example, N regions. To provide shorts, the main terminal electrodes contact both the respective main terminal region and the respective shield base region. Finally, first and second insulated gate electrodes are respectively disposed over the channel portions and insulatingly spaced therefrom. The gate electrodes are configured for respectively inducing in the channel portions, when gate voltage is applied to the gate electrodes, respective inversion channel regions of the one conductivity type conductively coupling the respective main terminal structure and the active base region. In this example, the induced inversion channels are of N conductivity type, and are induced when positive gate voltage is applied. The structure thus provided supports conduction in one direction when one of the inversion channels is induced, and ceases to support conduction in the one direction when the one inversion channel is no longer induced.The bidirectional rectifier supports conduction in the other direction when the other of the inversion channels Is induced, and ceases to support conduction in the other direction when the other inversion channel is no longer induced. Briefly stated, and in accordance with another aspect of the invention, the bidirectional structure summarized above is operated in a manner which provides active anode shorting. Thus, an aspect of the invention is the concept of active anode shorting of IGRs. As a result, the higher switching speeds which result from anode shorting are realized, without the loss of either reverse blocking capability or forward current density as is experienced with passive anode shorting. The active anode shorting concept may be applied for either polarity although, for convenience, it is primarily described herein in the context of one conduction polarity. However, as will be appreciated, since the preferred device structure is symmetrical, the active anode shorting concept can be applied to device conduction in the opposite direction. More particularly, one of the device terminal electrodes is arbitrarily termed an anode electrode, with positive polarity operating voltage applied, and the other terminal electrode termed the device cathode terminal, with negative polarity operating voltage applied. The device is conditioned to support forward conduction by applying gate voltage to the cathode side insulated gate electrode for inducing an inversion channel to conductively connect the cathode terminal region and the active base region. At the same tine, insufficient voltage is applied to the anode side insulated gate electrode such that no inversion channel is induced in the anode shield base region between the anode terminal region and the active base region. Bipolar conduction in the N conductivity type active base region results because electrons from the cathode region are conducted through the induced inversion channel into the active base region and, at the same time, holes are injected from the anode shield base region of P conductivity type into the active base region.Since the anode is not shorted, good injection efficiency of the anode is maintained. The device is subsequently conditioned into the forward blocking state by removing the gate voltage from the cathode side insulated gate electrode such that the inversion channel connecting the cathode terminal region and the active base region no longer exists and, at the same time, applying gate voltage to the anode insulated gate electrode to induce an inversion channel in the anode shield base region to conductively connect the anode terminal region and the active base region.This cuts off the primary conduction channel which is created by inversion in the cathode shield base region and, at the same time, creates a shorting path in the anode shield base region from the N conductivity type active base region to the anode electrode. This short provides a path for rapid removal of electrons in the N conductivity type active base region. Excess holes in the N conductivity active base region are removed via the cathode P conductivity type shield base region, as in a basicIGR structure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS While the novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims, the invention both as to organization and content, will be better understood and appreciated from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings, in wnich FIG. 1 is a highly schematic sectioned isometric view of a bidirectional IGR structure in accordance with the invention, with portions broken away to more clearly show the geometry of the semiconductor body surface FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of an alternative form of device wherein the P conductivity type shield base regions are each in two portions, one portion being doped substantially higher in concentration than the other FIG. 3 depicts the device of FIG. 2 connected in an electrical circuit for operation as an actively anode shortedIGR and FIG. 4 is a timing diagram depicting the manner in which the device of FIG. 3 is gated during operation. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring first to FIG. 1, depicted is an active portion of a bidirectional insulated gate rectifier IGR 10 fabricated, for purposes of example, as a vertical channel device employing DMOS technology. It will be appreciated, however, that other forms of device may be fabricated, for example, employingVMOS technology. The device 10 includes a body 12 of semiconductor material, such as silicon, having first and second principal surfaces 14 and 16 formed on opposite sides of the body 12. Formed generally at the first principal surface 14 are a first plurality of representative unit cells 18. A corresponding second plurality of representative unit cells 20 are formed generally at the second principal surface 16.From FIG. 1, it will be appreciated that the unit cells 18 of the first plurality and the unit cells 20 of the second plurality are essentially identical, but are symmetrically laterally offset with respect to each other for maximum forward current conductivity during operation. Considering in detail the structure of one of the identical unit cells 18 and one of the identical unit cells 20, the body 12 includes at least first and second channel surfaces 22 and 24, illustrated as being on opposite sides of the body 12.The body 12 additionally includes, and comprises in major part, an active base region 26 of one conductivity type, for example ofN conductivity type. Formed in the body 12 respectively adjacent the channel surfaces 22 and 24 are first and second shield base regions 28 and 30 of opposite conductivity type, in this example, of P conductivity type. The shield base regions 28 and 30 include at least portions doped higher in concentration than the active base region 26. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the shield base regions are doped substantially uniformly in concentration. First and second main terminal structures, generally designated 32 and 34, are formed in the body 12 spaced from the active base region 26 by the shield base regions 28 and 30 to respectively define channel portions 36 and 38 within the shield base regions 28 and 30 extending between respective ones of the main terminal structures 32 and 34 and the active base region 26 just below the surfaces 22 and 24. More particularly, the main terminal structures 32 and 34 further include respective first and second highly doped main terminal regions 40 and 42 of the one conductivity type, e.g.N type, formed in the semiconductor body 12 within the shield base regions 28 and 30. The main terminal structures 32 and 34 further include terminal electrodes 44 and 46, comprising for example aluminum, respectively in contact with the terminal regions 40 and 42. To provide conventional shorts between each of the main terminal regions 40 and 42 and the respective shield base region 28 or 30, the main terminal electrodes 44 and 46 respectively additionally contact shorting extensions 48 and 50, respectively, of the shield base regions 28 and 30, respectively.The metallized terminals are in turn connected, respectively, to representative device Main Terminals, MT1 and MT2, shown in highly schematic form. Although only the surface geometry at the second principal surface 16 is visible in FIG. 1, it will be appreciated that the same geometry is employed at the first principal surface 14, except for a lateral offset, as described hereinafter. It will also be appreciated that the P type shield base regions 28 and 30, and the N type terminal regions 40 and 42 may be formed by double diffusion technique as are conventionally employed in the fabrication of power MOSFETs. While the device 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 includes type main terminal regions 40 and 42, such is not strictly necessary in an IGR, as a sufficient N conductivity type accumulation region can in some cases be formed in the P conductivity type shield base regions 28 and 30 by inversion under the influence of electric fields from the gate electrodes, which are described hereinafter. The e main terminal structures 32 and 34 and associated shield base regions 28 and 30 have the effect of generally defining primary regions within the active base region 26. More particularly, a first primary active base region is located generally at 52. The first primary active base region, as herein employed, is that general region of the active base region 26 into which electrons from the first main terminal region 40 are channeled during device conduction when the first main terminal MT1 is biased negatively with respect to the second main terminal MT2. Similarly, a second primary active base region 54 is that general region of the active base region 26 into which electrons from the second main terminal region 42 are channeled during device conduction when the second main terminal MT2 is biased negatively with respect to the first main terminal MT1.It will be appreciated, however, that these primary regions 52 and 54 are highly generalized regions, and do not have definite boundaries. It is a feature of the device structure depicted inFIG. 1 that the unit cells 18 of the first or lower set and the unit cells 20 of the second or upper set are laterally and symmetrically offset with respect to each other such that the first shield base region 28 is generally aligned with the second primary active base region 54, and the second shield base region 30 is generally aligned with the first primary active base region 52. As a result, as will be apparent from the operational description hereinafter, the highest possible device forward conductivity is achieved. Typical doping concentrations that is, the number of dopant atoms per cubic centimeter for the various regions of the bidirectional insulated gate rectifier 10 are in the order of the following numbers The main terminal regions 40 and 42 lx1019 The active base region 26 1x1014 to 5x1015 The shield base regions 28 and 30 1X1016 to 5x1018. The device 10 additionally includes first and second sets of insulated gate electrodes 56 and 58 formed respectively over the channel surfaces 22 and 24 and configured for respectively inducing in the channel portions 36 and 3d, when gate voltage is applied, respective inversion channel regions of the one Conductivity type, e.g. of N conductivity type, conductively coupling the respective main terminal structure 32 or 34 and the active base region 26, or, more particularly, coupling the respective main terminal region 4U or 42 and the primary region 52 or 54 of the active base region 26. The gate electrodes 56 and 58 are insulated from the semiconductor body 12 by respective underlying insulating layers 60 and 62 which may comprise, for example, silicon dioxide or silicon nitride.The gate electrodes 56 and 58 may, for example, comprise aluminum or highly doped polycrystalline silicon of either conductivity type, as is known in the art. The gate electrodes 56 and 58 are electrically connected to representative device Gate terminals,G1 and G2, respectively shown in highly schematic form. Although one particular form of surface geometry is shown, i.e., with nearly square unit cells, it will be appreciated that different surface geometries may be employed.Typical examples are elongated strips, and various forms of concentric circles. Further, various techniques may be employed in fabricating the main terminal electrodes 44 and 46. For example, completely encased gate electrode structures 56 and 58 may be employed, with remote gate contacts not shown made thereto, in combination with terminal metallization 44 and 46 entirely covering both surfaces of the device 10. In the particular configuration depicted, it will be appreciated that the gate insulating layers 60 and 62, respectively, and the conductive gate electrodes 56 and 58, respectively, substantially entirely cover both surfaces 14 and 16, respectively, of the device 10, with the exception of windows at the centers of the unit cells 18 and 20, respectively, providing access to the main terminal electrodes 44 and 46, respectively. It will be appreciated from its symmetrical configuration that the device 10 is bidirectional in operation.In general, for either main terminal MT1 or MT2, respectively, biased positively with respect to the opposite main terminal, a positive voltage applied to the opposite gate terminal G2 or G1, respectively, with respect to the opposite main terminal MT2 or MT1, respectively, causes the device 10 to turn on, i.e., to be biased into forward conduction. More particularly, considering MT1 to be biased positively with respect to Mr2, a positive gate voltage applied via terminal G2 with respect to MT2 to the second gate electrode 58 induces an W conductivity type inversion channel 38 in the second shield base region 30, whereby electrons from the second main terminal region 42 are injected into the active base region 26 or, more particularly, into the primary region 54 of the active base region 26. Electron flow from MT2 is represented by a highly schematic electron current path 64.Considering the positively biased side of the device 10, i.e. the side with MT1, a hole current path 66 is provided by virtue of the shorting connection of the first terminal electrode metallization 44 to the first shield base region 28. Holes are accordingly injected from the first shield base region 28 into the active base region 26. Electrons in the electron current path 64 recombine with holes in the hole current path 66 to form the bulk of the current in the IGR 10. To turn off the device, positive gate voltage is removed from the second gate electrode 58, and the inversion channel 38 no longer exists. At this point, the device 10 no longer sustains conduction. In the opposite case, i.e., with the main terminalMT2 and the second main terminal electrode 46 biased positively with respect to the first main terminal electrode MT1 and the first main terminal electrode 44, a corresponding conduction mode occurs, except in the opposite direction. For the opposite case, a representative electron current path is designated 68, and a representative hole current path is designated 70. Referring now to FIG. 2, shown in cross sectional form is a modified bidirectional IGR 80 which achieves even higher forward conductivity in either of the two directions than theIGR 10 of FIG. 1. In the IGR 80 of FIG. 2, the first and second shield base regions 28 and 30 are each separated into two portions, with one of these portions in each case doped substantially higher in concentration than the other. The structure on each of the upper and lower sides of the device 80 is thus similar to the structure disclosed in the above referenced commonly assigned EP 83 103 196.8 in the context of a single directional IGR.However, the P conductivity type shield base region which is doped substantially higher in concentration has an additional function beyond that of the P type base region in the structure disclosed in the above mentioned application. Referring in greater detail to FIG. 2, in overall form and in surface geometry the device 80 is substantially identical to the device 10 of FIG. 1. Considering an exemplary firstP type region 28, tne region 28 comprises two portions 82 and 84.The portion 84 is adjacent to the gate insulating layer 60 and contains the inversion channel 36. The portion 82 extends from the terminal electrode 44 and has a substantially higher doping concentration than the portion 84, and as shown in FIG. 2 may also have a greater depth. By way of example, the P type portion 82 has a doping concentration in the order of 1x1019, in contrast to the doping concentration of the P type portion 84 which, as noted above, is in the range of from or1016 to sox1018. Similarly, the second shield base region 30 is separated into corresponding portions 86 and 88, the portion 86 being doped to a higher concentration than the region 88. The purpose of the FIG. 2 structure is two fold.First, for reasons explained in detail in the above referencedEP 83 103 196.8 the possibility of turn on of the parasitic SCRs is substantially reduced because voltage drop along the lateral dimension of the shield base regions 28 and 30 is reduced. Second, in the bidirectional structure of the present invention, whichever of the the highly doped portions 82 and 86 is connected to a positively biased main terminal serves as an efficient hole injector during forward conduction. At the same time, the lower doping concentration of whichever of the portions 84 and 88 is connected to the negatively biased main terminal facilitates the formation of the inversion regions comprising the conduction channels 36 and 38 under influence of the gate voltage. Considering, for purposes of example, the situation where electrode MT1 is biased positively with respect to electrode MT2, holes are efficiently injected from the highly doped portions 82 into the active base region 26, where they recombine with electrons from the second terminal region 42 conducted through the induced channel 38. Another aspect of the invention is the concept and method of actively anode shorted operation of an IGR. For purposes of example, this method is described below with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 employing the alternative device structure depicted in FIG. 2, although it will be appreciated that the device of FIG. 1 may similarly be operated. Referring now in detail to FIG. 3, for best understanding of the operational method described, the device terminals have been re labeled to imply unidirectional operation from a DC source, with the relabeled device being designated 90.Terminal XT1 of FIG. 2 is labeled as an Anode terminal in FIG.3, and Terminal MT2 of FIG. 2 is labeled as a Cathode terminal in FIG. 3. The first gate terminal G1 of FIG. 2 is designated an anode gate terminal GA in FIG. 3, and the second gate terminal G2 of FIG. 2 is designated a cathode gate electrodeGK in FIG. 3. Connected between the Anode terminal and the anode gate terminal GA is a source 92 of anode gate drive, the source 92 comprising suitable switching circuitry. Similarly connected between the cathode and the cathode gate GK terminals is a source 94 of cathode gate drive. An exemplary external circuit comprising a DC power supply or source 96 and a load resistor 98 are connected in series between the device Anode and Cathode terminals. Again, it will be appreciated that, since the device 90 is symmetrical, the connections and terminal designations can all be reversed. When the anode gate terminal GA is shorted to theAnode terminal by means of the gate drive circuitry 92, the device 90 blocks reverse current flow because the conduction channel 36 is not induced, and the PN junction between the P conductivity type shield base region 28 functioning as an anode region and the N conductivity type active base region 26 is reverse biased. To condition the device 90 for forward conduction, the circuitry 94 applies positive gate voltage to the cathode gate terminal GK, while the circuitry 94 maintains the anode gate terminal GA at the same potential as the Anode terminal.In other words, sufficient cathode gate voltage is applied to induce the cathode conduction channel 38, while insufficient gate voltage is applied to the anode gate terminal GA so that no conduction channel is induced at 36. This allows forward current conduction with good injection efficiency at the anode because tne anode is not shorted to the active base region 26. Under these conditions, the PN junction between the P conductivity type region 28 and the N conductivity type active base region 26 is forward biased. Additionally, holes are injected from the P portion 86 into the active base region 26 for recombination. To switch the device to block forward conduction, gate voltage is removed from the cathode gate terminal GK, for example, by shorting the terminal GK to the cathode through the circuitry 94 and, at the same time, positive bias is applied to the anode gate terminal GA by the gate drive circuitry 92 to induce the anode inversion channel 36. As a result, the conduction channel or inversion layer 38 in the cathode shield base region 30 no longer exists. At the same time, the inversion channel 36 induced in the anode shield base region 28 creates a shorting path for rapid removal of electrons from the active base region 26 to the device anode terminal 44. The holes in the active base region 26 are removed via the cathode shield base region 30, as is the case in the basic IGR structure summarized hereinabove. This operation is graphically summarized in FIG. 4, which depicts, on a common time axis representative gate tocathode voltage GGK and gate to anode GGA waveforms, with the resultant device current. Device turn on Ton andTurn off Toff times are also depicted. Thus, it will be appreciated that the active anode shorting technique allows fast IGR turn off, without degrading the reverse blocking capability and anode injection efficiency.Further, the IGR structure is bidirectional in that it is capable of controlling current flow for both applied polarities. While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is realized that numerous modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art.For example, the invention applies to complementary devices, wherein P type regions are used in place of tne N type regions described herein and vice versa. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
