## Description
Dialkylaminotetrahydrobenzothiazoles and Oxazoles Certain complex amides of lysergic acid I, R OH 9 ergolene 8ss carboxylic acid are found in ergoted rye ie, rye contaminated by the growth of the filamentous fungus Claviceps purpurea. Persons eating bread prepared from ergoted rye were subject to ergot poisoning, known in the Middle Ages as St. Anthony s Fire because of the intense feeling of heat in the extremities. Ergot poisoning was often fatal. The peripheral vasoconstrictor properties of the ergot alkaloids as a group are responsible for the fatalities seen with ergot poisoning, with gangrene of the extremeties being a common precipitating factor.EMI1.1 Two dozen ergot alkaloids have been characterized from isolates from Claviceps purpurea infestations. Derivatives of lysergic acid include the simple amides, ergine R NH2 and ergonovine ergometrine EMI2.1 as well as the peptide alkaloids R a complex amide derived from a polypeptide by cyclization including ergotamine, ergosine, ergocornine, ergocryptine, ergocristine, etc. The corresponding alkaloids based on isolysergic acid 9 ergolene 8a carboxylic acid have also been isolated. The ergot alkaloids as a group have several interesting pharmacologic activities uterine contraction oxytocic action , peripheral vasoconstriction, adrenergic blockade, and serotonin antagonism plus varied CNS activities including the production of hallucinations. Certain of the alkaloids individually are used to produce post partum uterine contractions and in the sympomatic treatment of migraine. Pharmacologic activity, toxicity and central effects vary from alkaloid to alkaloid. In general, hydrogenation of the delta 9 double bond results in compounds of lowered activity as regards peripheral action but adrenolytic and central inhibition of vasomotor centers may be enhanced. Derivatives of lysergic acid and dihydrolysergic acid are too numerous to mention, but include, generically, substitution on the indole nitrogen, atC 2 a bromocryptine is a 2 bromo derivative , replacement of N 6 methyl by other alkyl groups or by allyl and replacement of the carboxamide function at C S by various groups, particularly cyanomethyl, carboxamidomethyl, methylthiomethyl, and methoxymethyl. In addition, there has been substitution of simpler amide groups butanolamide methyl ergonovine diethyl amide for the complex polypeptide chains of the natural alkaloids. In the past, there has been considerable speculation, frequently followed by a synthetic effort, as to what portions of the ergoline molecule are responsible for pharmacologic activity ie, do partstructures exist which retain, perhaps selectively, certain pharmacologic activities of the parent alkaloids One part structure which has been thoroughly examined is the amino tetrahydronaphthalene structure II from which the B and D rings of an ergoline have been subtracted.EMI3.1 where R is carboxamide, hydroxy, amino etc. The elements of a ss phenethylamine can also be discerned from I using the phenyl ring and carbons 5 and 10 plus the nitrogen at 6, a part structures in which only the A ring is retained. In addition, tricyclics lacking the B pyrrole ring as well as benz cd indoles lacking the D ring see United States patent 4,110,339 have been prepared.None of these part structures seemed to have the desired degree of specificity as regards the dopamine D 2 agonist activity prolactin inhibition etc of ergocornine, dihydroergocornine, lergotrile or pergolide United States patents 3,920,664, 4,054,660 and 4,166,182 for example . Recently, however Kornfeld andBach have found that the A ring of an ergoline is not required for D 2 agonist activity. These new part structures are named as hexahydropyrrolo 4,3 g guino lines see United States patent 4,235,909. A related structure, a hexahydropyrazolo 4,3 g quinoline, UnitedStates patent 4,198,415, also has excellent D 2 agonist action.The corresponding 2 ring compounds, in which the D ring of the ergoline is opened, are also activeD 2 agonists see United States patent 4,235,226 for the amino substituted isoindoles, and United States patent 4,276,300 for the amino substituted indazoles like the three ring pyrazoles . It has now been found that other hetero ring systems than pyrrole and pyrazole can be attached to the perhydroquinoline ring rings B C of an ergoline to complete a three ring analogue.One of these is a pyrimidine see Nichols and Kornfeld,United States patent 4,501,890. 2 Amino 6 dialkylaminotetrahydrobenzothiozoles and oxazoles are not known. This invention provides tetrahydrobenzothiazoles and oxazoles of the formula EMI5.1 1 2 wherein Y is S or O, R1 and R2 are independently H, methyl, ethyl or n propyl, and R3 and R4 are independently H, methyl, ethyl, n propyl or allyl and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof formed with non toxic acids. Compounds wherein Y is S are substituted4,5,6,7 tetrahydrobenzothiazoles and those wherein Y is O are substituted 4, 5,6, 7 tetrahydrobenzoxazoles. Compounds according to XX wherein one or both of R3 and R4 is H are intermediates in that they can be allylated or alkylated to yield compounds of this invention wherein R3 and R4 are individually methyl, ethyl, n propyl or allyl. A preferred group of compounds according toXX are those in which R3 and R4 are both methyl, both n propyl or both allyl. Another preferred group are those compounds according to XX in which R1 and R2 are both H. The compounds of this invention wherein neither R3 nor R4 is H have receptor agonist activity ie, they can increase the amounts centrally or periph erally or both of certain neurohormones. For example, compounds according to XX in which both R3 and R4 are allyl or n propyl, are dopamine agonists, particularly dopamine D 2 agonists, capable of increasing the effective concentration of dopamine in the brain. Compounds wherein R3 and R4 are both methyl have a agonist action. Also included within the scope of this invention are acid addition salts of the nitrogenous bases represented by XX. The above compounds contain at least three basic nitrogens first, the amine group at C 6 secondly, the ring nitrogen in the fused heterocyclic ring and thirdly, the NR1R2 group. The nitrogen of theC 6 amino group is generally the most basic of the amine functions and readily forms acid addition salts. Strong inorganic acids such as the mineral acids or strong organic acids, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, can when employed in excess form di salts with one of the other amine functions in the compounds of this invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention thus include mono or di salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxyalkanoic and alkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc.Such pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4 dioate, hexyne 1,6dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluene sulfate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenyl acetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, a hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene l sulfonate, naphthalene 2 sulfonate and the like salts. The compounds of this invention according to XX above, where R3 and R4 are individually only methyl, ethyl or n propyl R5 and R6 can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme Reaction Scheme IEMI8.1 wherein Y, R1 and R2 have their previous meanings andR5 and R6 are individually methyl, ethyl or n propyl. In Reaction Scheme I above, a protected, as by ketal formation, cyclohexan 1,4 dione, is reductively aminated with a secondary amine, RNR5R6, using a borohydride in a mutual inert solvent as the reducing agent.As a starting material, the ketal of cyclohexane 1,4dione with 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propanediol XXI is commercially available and is therefore preferred although monoketals with other diols, ie, ethylenediol, 1,3propylenediol and the like, may also be used. Sodium cyanoborohydride is the reducing agent of choice, although other metal hydrides can also be employed.Ethers, and particularly cyclic ethers such as THF, are the solvents of choice for this reaction. The product of the reductive amination, XXII, is next deprotected by treatment with acid to yield a 4 dialkylaminocyclohexanone. Bromination alpha to the carbonyl with bromine in EBr acetic acid yields the alpha bromoketone, XIV. Reaction of the bromoketone with urea, thiourea, an N alkyl urea, an N,N dialkyl urea, an N alkyl or an N,N dialkyl thiourea yields directly XXa. Compounds according to XX wherein one or both of R3 and R4 are allyl are prepared by dealkylating a dialkyl amine XX where R3 and R4 are methyl or XXa 5 6 where R5 and R6 are methyl with CNBr to yield an intermediate compound wherein one or both R3 and R4 orR5 and R6 are H and then reductively allylating this amine with acrylic acid or directly allylating with allylbromide in the presence of a base. If desired, a primary amine group at C 2 can be protected as by acylation, and the acyl group removed by hydrolysis after the allylation at the C 6 amine is completed. Compounds according to XX above have an asymmetric carbon, the C 6 carbon, to which the amino group NR3R4 is attached. Thus, compounds represented by XX above include two optical isomers occurring as a i or dl pair or racemate. Resolution of a i pair of this invention into its optical antipodes can be accomplished by the usual empirical procedures used by those skilled in the art. Such separated optical isomers are included within the scope of this invention. Compounds preparable by the above procedures which illustrate the scope of this invention include 2,6 bis dimethylamino 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro benzothiazole methanesulfonate, 2, 6 bis methyl n propyiamino 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzoxazole hydrobromide, i 2 dimethylamino 6 ethyl n propylamino 5,6, 7,8 tetrahydrobenzoxazole sulfate, i 2 diethylamino 6 di n propylamino 5, 6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzothiazole hydrobromide, 1 2 methylethylamino 6 diallylamino 5, 6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzothiazole maleate, 2 dimethylamino 6 allylmethylamino 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzoxazole succinate, 1 2 diethylamino 6 allyl n propyl 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzothiazole tartrate, 2 amino 6 diallylamino 5, 6,7, 8 tetrahydro benzothiazole dinitrobenzoate, i 2 ethylmethylamine 6 dimethylamino 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzoxazole phosphate and the like. This invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples. Example 1 Preparation of i 2 Amino 6 di n propylamino 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzothiazole About 125 ml of methanol were added to a 500 ml round bottom flask under a nitrogen blanket. Fortytwo ml of di n propylamine were added and the resulting solution cooled to about 0 in an ice water bath.Twenty ml of 5N methanolic hydrochloric acid were added.The reaction mixture was stirred until salt formation was complete. Ten grams of 1,4 cyclohexanedione mono2,2 dimethyltrimethylene ketal were added as a solid.The reaction mixture was stirred with cooling for several minutes at which point 2.25 g of sodium cyanoborohydride were added in one portion. A white slurry developed rapidly which was stirred in the cold for several minutes and then at room temperature under a nitrogen blanket for about 30 hours. An additional 2.2 g of sodium cyanoborohydride were added. After an additional 24 hours stirring at room temperature, at which time TLC chloroform methanol 95 5 indicated a new spot and the absence of a spot corresponding to starting material. The reaction mixture was therefore filtered and the filter cake washed with methanol. The filtrate and wash were combined, and the solvent evaporated therefrom to yield a thick, white slurry. The slurry was cooled to about OOC and 100 ml of 1N hydrochloric acid were added with stirring.The resulting solution was extracted twice with equal volumes of ether. The ether extracts were separated and discarded.The aqueous layer was cooled and then made basic by the addition of 5N aqueous sodium hydroxide pH 12 . The basic layer was extracted three times with 50 ml portions of methylene dichloride. The methylene dichloride extracts were combined, the combined extracts were washed once with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and were then dried. Evaporation of the solvent in vacuo yielded a yellow oil containing some solid weight 6.26 g. The residue was flash chromatographed over silica using a 100 1 ether triethylamine solvent as eluant. The term flash chromatography refers to a procedure developed by Still et al., J. Org. Chem., 43, 2923 l978 . Fifty ml fraction were taken. Fractions 10 15 were shown by TLC to contain the desired material. These fractions were combined and concentrated in vacuo to yield 5.40 g of a nearly colorless oil comprising 4 di n propylamino 1 cyclohexanone 2,2 dimethyltrimethylene ketal. The ketal group was removed by dissolving 4.4 g of the above ketal in 110 ml of 6N hydrochloric acid with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere for 48 hours at room temperature. The colorless solution was extracted with 50 ml of ether the ether extract was discarded. The acidic solution was then made basic by the addition of an excess of 5N aqueous sodium hydroxide.The resulting cloudy mixture was extracted three times with 50 ml portions of methylene dichloride. The methylene di chloride extracts were combined, and the combined extracts washed three times with 50 75 ml portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer was then dried, and the solvent removed in vacuo to yield 2.96 g of a pale yellow oil comprising 4 di n propylaminocyclohexanone formed in the above reaction. The compound showed the expected carbonyl peak at S.85p in the infrared. The infrared also showed no hydroxyl absorption. A solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of 4 di n propylaminocyclohexanone in 7.5 ml of glacial acetic acid. 1.2 ml of 31 hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid was added followed by the dropwise addition of 0.195 ml of bromine. The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen for about ss hour. The volatile constituents were then removed in vacuo to leave a brown viscous oil comprising 2 bromo 4 di n propylaminocyclohexanone formed in the above reaction. 420 mg of thiourea were added to this residue followed by 10 ml of anhydrous ethanol. The mixture was stirred to give a brown solution. The solution was heated to reflux temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere for about 2 hours. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at ambient temperature, then filtered.The recovered solid, comprising i 2 amino 5 di n propylamino 4,5,6,7 benzothiazole dihydrobromide formed in the above reaction weighed 1.05 g. The dihydrobromide salt was recrystallized from a methanol ether solvent mixture to yield 589 mg of purified dihydrobromide salt.

The corresponding 2 aminotetrahydrobenzoxazole can be prepared in a similar fashion by substituting urea for thiourea in the above reaction. Example 2 Preparation of i 2 Amino 6 dimethylamino 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobenzothiazole Ten grams of 1,4 cyclohexanedione mono 2,2dimethyltrimethylene ketal were mixed with 50 g of anhydrous dimethylamine in benzene solution at about 50C. 4.75 g of TiCl4 in benzene was added thereto in dropwise fashion. A precipitate formed. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature at which temperature it was stirred for about 1 hour. A solid which formed was separated by filtration. Evaporation of the solvent from the filtrate yielded about 9.88 g of an oil which was hydrogenated at 60 psi at room temperature overnight in anhydrous ethanol with 0.5 g ofPd C as the catalyst. The catalyst was removed by filtration.Evaporation of the filtrate in vacuo gave 8.82 g of an oil comprising 4 dimethylaminocyclohexane 2,2 dimethyltrimethylene ketal formed in the above reaction. TLC showed one spot SiO2 EtOAc . Proton NMR CDCl3 6 1.0 s, 6H 1.2 1.9 m, 6H 2.0 2.5 m, 9H 3.4 s, 4H . The ketal group was removed as follows 0.37 g of the above ketal were dissolved in 90 aqueous formic acid and the resulting solution heated at 85 900C for about 1 hour. The formic acid was removed by evaporation in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in CH2C12 and the organic solution extracted twice with approximately equal volumes of lN hydrochloric acid. The acidic extracts were combined.Evaporation to dryness gave 0.2 g of 4 dimethylamino cyclohexanone hydrochloride one spot by TLC SiO2 MeOH AcOH J. Two repeat runs with 1.58 g and 3.19 g of starting ketal gave 1.26 g and 2.35 g of amino ketone, respectively. Proton NMR CDC13 DMSOd6 6 1.80 2.30 m, 2H 2.35 2.68 m, 6H 2.85 d, 6H 3.5 3.9 m, lH .

As previously stated, the compounds of this invention wherein neither R nor R4is H are receptor agonists ie, they are capable of increasing the quantities of various neurohormones dopamine and norepinephrine in particular available for interaction with specific receptors. For example, the compound according to XX wherein R1 and R2 are H and R3 and R4 are both n propyl, is a specific dopamine D 2 agonist. One of such dopamine agonist activities is the inhibition of prolactin secretion, as demonstrated according to the following protocol. Adult male rats of the Sprague Dawley strain weighing about 200 g were housed in an air conditioned room with controlled lighting lights on 6 a.m. 8 p.m. and fed lab chow and water ad libitum. Each rat received an intraperitoneal injection of 2.0 mg of reserpine in aqueous suspension 18 hours before administration of the test drug. The purpose of the reserpine was to keep the rat prolactin levels uniformly elevated. The compound was dissolved in 10 percent ethanol, and injected intraperitoneally to groups of ten rats at preselected dose levels. A control group of 10 intact males received an equivalent amount of 10 percent ethanol. One hour after treatment, all rats were killed by decapitation, and 150 p1 aliquots of serum were assayed for prolactin. The difference between the prolactin levels of the treated rats and the control rats, divided by the prolactin level of the control rats gives the percent inhibition of prolactin secretion attributable to the given dose. Inhibition percentages are given in Table 1 below for i 2 amino 6 di n propylamino 5, 6, 7,8 tetra hydrobenzothiazole dihydrobromide. In the table, column 1 gives the dose and column 2, the percent prolactin inhibition at the specified dose level. Table 1 Dose t Inhibition 50 mcg kg 30 Dopamine agonists are also known to affect turning behavior in 6 hydroxydopamine lesioned rats in a test procedure designed to uncover compounds useful for the treatment of Parkinsonism. In this test, nigroneostriatal lesioned rats are employed, as prepared by the procedure of Ungerstedt and Arbuthnott, BrainRes, 24, 485 1970 . A compound having dopamine agonist activity causes the rats to turn in circles contralateral to the side of the lesion. After a latency period, which varies from compound to compound, the number of turns is counted over a 15 minute period. Results obtained from such testing for i 2 amino 6 di n propylamino 5 , 6,7, 8 tetrahydrobenzothiazole dihydrobromide are set forth in Table 2 below. In the table, column 1 gives the dose and column 2 the average number of turns observed in first 15 minutes after the end of the latency period. Table 2 Dose Average number of Turns 1000 mcg kg 51 Compounds according to XX, particularly those wherein both R3 and R4 are methyl, reduce the blood pressure of anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, as illustrated by the following experiment Adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR Taconic Farms, Germantown, New York , weighing approximately 300 g. were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium 60 mg. kg., i.p. . The trachea was cannulated and the SHR respired room air. Pulsatile arterial blood pressure was measured from a cannulated carotid artery using a Statham transducer P23 ID . Mean arterial blood pressure was calculated as diastolic blood pressure plus 1 3 pulse pressure. Cardiac rate was monitored by a cardiotachometer which was triggered by the systolic pressure pulse. Drug solutions were administered i.v. through a catheter placed in a femoral vein. Arterial blood pressure and cardiac rate were recorded on a multichannel oscillograph Beckman, Model R511A .Fifteen minutes were allowed to elapse following surgery for equilibration of the preparation. Table 3 which follows gives the results of this test using 2 amino 6 di n propyl 5, 6,7,8 tetra hydrobenzothiazole dihydrobromide. In Table 3, column 1 gives the dose level, column 2, the change in mean arterial blood pressure.
