# Single package water based compositions.

## Abstract
Single package coating or ink composition of pH 7 to 12 comprising a reaction product of a binder resin and a scavenging agent which reacts with anions of the initiator used to prepare the binder resin, the binder resin has a Tg of 20 to 70 C, is prepared in an aqueous medium devoid of emulsifiers, and is a polymer of an ethylenically unsaturated acid of 3 to 10 carbon atoms and an acrylic monomer s selected from alkyl acrylates and methacrylates containing 4 to 24 carbon atoms, amount of the acid being 0 to 5 parts per 100 parts of the acrylic monomer s .
