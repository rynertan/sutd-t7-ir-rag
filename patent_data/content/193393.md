# CRITICAL TEMPERATURE OR TIME INTERVAL INDICATOR

## Abstract
An intermediate indicator assembly 10, 30 is provided which is adapted to define a time interval or critical temperature indicator 12, 48 when folded along a fold line 20, 34 . The intermediate indicator assembly 10, 30 reduces the overall cost of the indicator 12, 48 by eliminat ing barrier strips or separating frames which were previously necessary to maintain an indicating wick 26, 42 separate from an indicating liquid 28, 38 which may be sorbed into the wick 26, 42 to provide a visual indication that a predetermined time interval has expired or that the device has been exposed to a predetermined temperature. Accord ing to the invention, the liquid 28, 38 and the wick 26, 42 are disposed on opposite sides of the fold line 20, 34 along which the intermediate indicator assembly 10, 30 may be subsequently folded to activate the indicator 12, 48 and place it into operation.
