## Description
Device for storing brushes or the like. The invention relates to a device for storing brushes or the like, comprising a container with an associated cover and a suspension means for the brushes within the container. Such a device is, for example, known from Dutch patent application 78.09465. This known device is exclusively suited for a very specific type of brush, i.e. a brush with a brush portion detachably connected to the handle portion.To this end, the brush portion has a pherical projection at its end to be coupled to the handle portion. The suspension means comprises a plurality of holes accessible through a slit, in which holes the brush portions can be suspended with their pherical projection. The invention aims to provide a device of the abovementioned kind, which is suited for storing different types of brushes. To this end, the device according to the invention is characterized in that the suspension means is provided with a plurality of spring clips each adapted to engage a brush handle. In this manner it is obtained that the usual types of brushes can be easily stored in the device according to the invention by pressing the brush handle of the brush to be stored in a spring clip. Storing and taking out of a brush is very simple. Preferably, the suspension means comprises spring clips adapted for brushes with different handle diameters, so that brushes with various sizes can be stored in the device. According to a favourable embodiment of the invention the suspension means is detachably mounted in the upper part of the container with a clamping fit. Thereby, a suspension means with spring clips adapted for brushes with different handle diameters can be disposed, if desired, so that the versatility of the device according to the invention is increased. According to a simple embodiment the suspension means includes a ring made of plastic, wherein each of the spring clips consists of two inwardly directed, curved legs lying symmetricall y withrespect to a radius of the ring and and formed integrally with the ring. In this manner, the suspension means can be easily manufactured at low costs. According to the invention the ring can be joined with a support ring by radially outwardly directed connecting pieces, said support ring substantially engaging the inner wall of the cup shaped container in the mounted position and having an outwardly directed support edge at its upper end, which support edge rests on an outwardly directed flange formed at the upper end of the container. According to the invention the also cup shaped cover has an outwardly directed flanged edge at its lower end, said flanged edge carrying a downwardly extending edge at its circumference which edge surrounds the flange of the container when the cover is placed on the container. Advantageously, in this case a sealing ring is attached on the flange of the container, while an annular rim is formed on the flanged edge of the cover, which annular rim seats on the sealing ring when the cover is placed on the container, wherein the downwardly extending edge of the cover has a plurality of inwardly directed cams regularly distributed around its circumference, said cams being adapted to cooperate with an equal plurality of outwardly directed cams of the flange of the container, said outwardly directed cams having a thickness varying in an axial direction seen in a circumferential direction.In this manner, the device can be fully closed by engaging the cams of the container and the cover with eachother, when the cover is locked on the container, so that a liquid disposed in the container cannot evaporate and the brushes stored in the device remain in an optimum condition. The invention will hereafter be further explained by reference to the drawings, in which an embodiment of the device according to the invention is shown. Fig. 1 is an elevational view, partial in crosssection of an embodiment of an device according to the invention. Fig. 2 shows a top view of the suspension means of the invention. Fig. 3 shows a detail of fig. 1 in an enlarged view. Referring to fig. 1, there is shown an elevational view of a device 1 for storing brushes or the like, wherein a part is shown in cross section. The device 1 consists of a cup shaped container 2 and an also cup shaped associated cover 3. A suspension means 4 for the brushes is mounted in the upper part of the container 2, said suspension means 4 being provided with a plurality of spring clips 5 regularly distributed around its circumference. As shown in the top view of fig. 2 the suspension means 4 has spring clips 5 with various sizes, so that the suspension means is suited for brushes with different handle diameters, as, of course, each spring clip 5 is already suited for retaining paint brushes with various handle diameters in itself. The suspension means 4 comprises an inner ring 6, the spring clips 5 being integral with the inner ring 6. Each spring clip 5 consists of two curved legs 7 lying symmetrically with respect of a radius of the ring and extending inwardly.The inner ring 6 is joined to a support ring 9 by connecting pieces 8 lying at the location of the spring clips 5, which support ring 9 has an outwardly directed support edge 10 at its upper end. The suspension means 4 can be manufactured in one piece from a plastics material at low costs. In the mounted position of the suspension means 4, the support ring 9 lies opposite of the upper end of the container wall 11, wherein the support edge 10 rests on an outwardly directed flange 12 formed at the upper end of the container wall 11, as shown in fig. 1 and 3. The suspension means 4 is mounted with a clamping fit by providing a plurality of axially extending protrusions regularly distributed along the circumference of the support ring 9 at the outer side thereof not shown in the drawings . Thereby, the suspension means 4 can be easily removed and replaced by a suspension means with spring clips adapted for brushes with different handle diameters, if desired. Thereby, the device 1 can be used for storing brushes of the most different kinds.Storing and taking out of the brushes is very simple, because the brush handle can be easily pressed into a spring clip and removed again. The brushes, for example paint brushes,can be stored during a longer period by using the device 1, without the quality decreasing because the brush does not rest on the bristles.Because the brushes are suspendingly stored in the device 1, the bristles remain free from the dirt, like paint rests and the like, that will collect on the bottom 13 of the con tainer 2. In order to prevent the evaporation of the liquid, like for example water or turpentine, normally disposed in the container 2, the cover 3 can sealingly be disposed on the container 2. To this end, the cover 3 has at its lower end and outwardly directed flanged edge 14 carrying a downwardly extending edge 15 at its circumference. With the cover 3 placed on the container 2,the edge 15 surrounds the flange 12 of the container 2 with clearance. A sealing ring 16 is attached on this flange 12 of the container 2, which sealing ring 16 consists for example of rubber. Theflangededge 14 of the cover 3 is provided with an annular rim 17 which seats on the sealing ring 16 when the cover 3 is placed on the container 2.The downwardly extending edge 5 of the cover 3 is formed with a plurality of inwardly directed cams 18 regularly distributed around its circumference, only one of said cams 18 being shown in the drawings. The flange 14 of the container 2 is provided with an equal plurality of outwardly directed cams 19, only one of which being shown in the drawings. The cams 19 are made as run on cams, because seen in a circumferential direction the axial thickness of the cams increases from a minimum value to a maximum value. During use of the device 1, the cover 3 is placed on the container 2, wherein the cams 18 of the cover 3 pass the cams 19 of the container 2. The cover 3 is then rotated with respect to the container 2, whereby the cams 18 engage below the cams 19 and the annular rim 17 is pressed on the sealing ring 16 by the increasing axial thickness of the cam 19. Thereby, the device 1 is fully closed so that the liquid within the container 2 can hardly evaporate. In this manner it is obtained that the brushes stored in the device 1 are stored in optimum conditions. To protect the sealing ring 16 when the cover 3 is removed, an upwardly extending edge 20 is formed at the circumference of the flange 14, the height of which is at least equal to the thickness of the sealing ring 16. The cover 3 is provided with a recessed part 21.Ribs 22 equally spaced around the circumference are formed on the outer wall of this part 21, said ribs extending in an axial direction. The cover 3 can thereby easily manually rotated on the container 2. The diameters of the container 2 and the cover 3 are such, that the container 2 fits in the cover 3 as indicated by a dashed line in fig. 1. Thereby, the dimensions of the device 1 can be reduced to about the half, which is very favourable for packaging and transporting. It is noted that the container 2 and the cover 3 of the embodiment shown are moulded from a plastic material. The outer side of the container 2 can for example be processed by spark erosion, whereby a nice appearance is obtained. Of course, the container 2 and the cover 3 can be manufactured in an other manner. Finally, it is noted that the container 2 can be devided into two or more compartments by means of partitions or the like not shown in the drawings . Thereby, the liquid in one of said compartments can be stored separately of the liquids in the other compartments, so that for example with paint brushes, distinction can be made between light and dark paint colours. The invention is not restricted to the abovedescribed embodiment which can be varied in a number of ways within the scope of the invention.
