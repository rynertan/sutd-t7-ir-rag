# Folded bit line shared sense amplifiers.

## Abstract
For sensing the logic state of an accessed memory cell in a dynamic MOS random access memory, a shared sense amplifier 14 is positioned between and coupled to first and second bit lines A,B via first and second isolation transis tors 10,12 and is also positioned between and coupled to third and fourth bit lines C,D via third and fourth isolation transistors 16,18 . In use, a memory cell capacitor 26 is coupled to a selected bit line A and a dummy cell capacitor C
