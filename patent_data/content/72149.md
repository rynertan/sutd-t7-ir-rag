# Improvements relating to filtration devices.

## Abstract
A rotary filtration unit comprises a rotatable generally cy lindrical filter drum assembly mounted at one axial end in a chamber formed within a housing having an inlet passage formed for supplying material to be filtered to the cylindrical outer surface of the drum and an outlet passage communicat ing with the interior of the drum for taking away material filtered by passage through the drum from outside to inside. The drum assembly comprises inner 7 and outer filter 6 barrels which retain between them a cylindrical filter element 8 such as of wire gauze or porous sintered metal. The outer barrel 6 has regularly spaced apart relatively large openings 36 in its outer surface which communicate through the thickness of the bar rel wall and via divergent passageways 38 with even larger openings 39 on the inner surface of the drum. In contrast, the inner barrel has a plurality of much smaller through open ings 41 in registry with each of the large openings 39 in the inner surface of the outer barrel. A flushing tube 22, 23 ex tends into sealing contact with the outer surface of the outer barrel 6 and has an opening which, depending on the angular orientation or the filter drum, either registers with one of the openings therein or with the space between adjacent open ings. When the flushing tube is in registry with one of the filter drum openings, clean filtered material can back flush through the drum and flush away into the flushing tube impurities deposited on the filter. The described unit can be used with heavily contaminated material, and can be operated such that outlet pressure fluctuations resulting from the flushing opera tion are minimized which is particularly advantageous for ex ample where the material being filtered is plastics stock for an extruder producing fine films or filaments.
