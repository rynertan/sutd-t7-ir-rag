# Optical fiber insensitive to temperature variations.

## Abstract
Metal coated optical fibers are often employed in high temperature optical communications applications. However, such optical fibers have been found to evidence a substantial decrease in optical transmission as a function of increased temperature. Optical fibers having a temperature insensitive optical transmission are obtained by annealing a metal coated optical fiber at a temperature at which optical transmission is substantially the same as that observed at room temperature. Aluminium coated optical fibers annealed at 560 C evidence an optical transmission indepen dent of temperature between about 200 C and at least about 560 C.
