# Gas insulated switchgear equipment.

## Abstract
A gas insulated switchgear equipment includes a main bus conduit 10 containing a main bus conductor 13 and disposed substantially horizontally, and a container 15, 16 connected substantially vertically to the main bus conduit 10 at a top portion thereof for accommodating a discon necting switch unit which is composed of a pair of contact members 6, 8 one of which is to be electrically connected to the bus conductor 13 . Spacers 11, 12 are disposed substantially vertically at predetermined positions in the main bus conduit 10 for defining a gas filled compartment for the disconnecting switch unit. A post like insulation support 20 is fixedly mounted on the container of the disconnecting switch unit for securely supporting a station ary conductor 19 mounted on the contact member 6 to be electrically connected to the bus bar 13 . A tulip like current collector 18 for connecting one end of a branch conductor 17 having the other end connected to the bus conductor 13 and the stationary conductor 19 to each other.
