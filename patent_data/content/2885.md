# Passive lap and shoulder belt system.

## Abstract
A passive three point lap and shoulder belt system has the inboard ends of the lap 24 and shoulder 26 belts mounted on the vehicle body 10 generally adjacent the hip of the occupant by an emergency release buckle 28, 30 . Lap and shoulder belt retractors 46 are mounted on the door generally adjacent the hip of the occupant for winding the belts thereon upon closing movement of the door and unwinding the belts therefrom upon opening movement of the door. An anchor loop 42 is mounted on the door generally adjacent the shoulder of the occupant and slidably receives the shoulder belt to dispose the shoulder belt diagonally across the chest of the occupant when the door is closed and forwardly of the occupant when the door is open. A guide loop 64 is attached to the shoulder belt at a point thereon which travels between the retractor and the anchor loop during movement of the door between open and closed positions. The guide loop slidably receives the lap belt to lift the lap belt from the retractor and vertically along the door toward the anchor loop during opening movement of the door so that the lap belt assumes a stowed occupant access position generally parallel with the shoulder belt to facilitate occupant ingress and egress. Closing of the door winds the shoulder belt and lowers the lap belt to the restraining position across the lap of the occupant.
