# Formation of simulated lead lights.

## Abstract
A method of forming a simulated lead light involves the application of opaque canes to the surface of a transparent or translucent sheet of material, in which the opaque canes are built up by successive applications of adhesive and opaque particulate material, such as silicon carbide. The adhesive can be screen printed onto the carrier surface and the particulate material can be dusted into the printed adhesive. The applica tion of adhesive and particulate material can be repeated until a raised cane of desired thickness is built up on the carrier surface to simulate a lead cane. The method can also be used in conjunction with the screen printing of colours onto the carrier surface to simulate a lead cane. The method can also be used in conjunction with the screen printing of colours onto the carrier surface to simulate stained glass separated by simulated lead canes.
