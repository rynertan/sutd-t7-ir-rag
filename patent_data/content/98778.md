# Method and apparatus for cement bond logging.

## Abstract
In accordance with principles of the present invention methods and apparatus are provided for evaluating the quality of the cement bond in cased boreholes. Acoustic energy is used to excite the borehole casing annulus formation system and the quality of the cement bond is determined by examining the ratios of the signals received by two longitudinally spaced apart receivers supported on a sonde. The acoustic energy is generated by two transmitters symmetrically disposed above and below the receivers along the sonde. The spacing between the receivers themselves and between the receivers and the transmitters are selected so as to enhance the correlation be tween the ratios of the received signals and the quality of the cement bond log. An additional receiver, supported on the sonde at a small distance from one of the transmitters, is em ployed to determine the quality of the cement bond in hard formations.
