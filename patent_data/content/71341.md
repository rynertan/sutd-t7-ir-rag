# Sheet feeder.

## Abstract
A sheet feeder for feeding sheets from a stack thereof, which feeder automatically fans or separates the uppermost sheets within the stack to facilitate their feeding. The feeder includes a feed roll brake 25 releasably coupled to a feed roll 16 which brake 25 rotates with the feed roll 16 until a pre determined force is applied on the brake 25 by a spring 34 that has been compressed by the normal feeding rotation of the feed roll 16 , causing the feed roll 16 to rotate in the opposite direction to the normal feed direction, thereby fanning the uppermost sheets.
