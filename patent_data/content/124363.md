## Description
PHOTOCHEMICAL DECONTAMINATION TREATMENT OF WHOLE BLOOD OR BLOOD COMPONENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recipients of blood and blood components risk acquiring infections from foreign biological organisms, either pre existing in the blood at the time of collection or transmitted to the blood product during manipulation. Medical personnel who are in contact with collected human blood or clinical samples also have a significant chance of being exposed to potentially lethal blood borne or sample borne biological organisms.Blood components today are obtained from blood donors and frequently involve pooled lots, where one or more of the donors may be harboring a viral, bacterial or other infection. Since the blood or blood components are required to provide physiological functions in a mammalian host, normally a human host, these functions must not be impaired by the decontamination treatment of the biological composition. In addition, the blood or blood components may not be modified in such a way as to make them immunogenic which could result in an adverse immune response. Finally, any treatment should not leave residues or products detrimental to the health of the host or such residues or products should be readily removable. U.S. Patent No. 4,327,086 describes the method for heat treating an aqueous solution containing human blood coagulation factor XIII. U.S. Patent No.4,321,919 proposes extracorporeal treatment of human blood with 8 methoxypsoralen 8 MOP . Hyde and Hearst,Biochemistry 1978 17 1251 1257, describe the binding of two psoralen derivatives to DNA and chromatin.Musajo et al., Experientia 1965 XXI. 22 24, describe photo inactivation of DNA containing viruses with photosensitizing furocoumarins. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,350,594, 4,348,283 and 4,350,156 describe filtration methods for selective removal of blood components based on molecular weight. U.S. Patent No. 4,329,986 describes extracorporeal treatment of blood with a chemotherapeutic agent which is subsequently removed by dialysis. The July August 1982 issue of Genetic Engineering News proposed the use of psoralens to sterilize clinical or commercial reagents or instruments. Some data showing substantial impairment of the biological function of certain enzyme proteins using furocoumarins are published in the scientific literature see for example, Veronese, F. M. et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 34 351 1981 Veronese, F. M. et al.,Photochem. Photobiol. 36 25 1982 . In the present invention methods and compositions are provided for decontamination of biological compositions, by permanently inactivating polynucleotides capable of having pathological effect in a mammalian host.Particularly, furocoumarin compositions are employed for inactivating polynucleotides, such as viral gnomes, capable of infectious replication in a mammalian host.Aqueous compositions such as blood or blood components may be decontaminated by treatment with furocoumarins especially psoralen derivatives, and irradiation, preferably with I Jng wavelength ultraviolet UVA light, whereby the physiological activities of the non nucleic acid components are retained. Whenever the term polynucleotide is used in this application it should be understood to mean 1 microorganisms containing nucleic acids either DNA or RNA , 2 nucleic acid genomes or sub genomic fragments from microorganisms, from procaryotes lower life forms or from eucaryotes higher life forms , or 3 any other nucleic acid fragments. In decontaminating the biological composition, an aqueous medium containing the biological preparation is combined with an appropriate amount of the furocoumarin composition and irradiated with ultraviolet light under conditions where all of the polynucleotide is inactivated, while the components other than nucleic acid retain their normal physiological activities. Various biological compositions may be employed, particularly protein compositions involving blood or blood components. Whole blood, packed red cells, platelets, and plasma fresh or fresh frozen plasma are of interest. Other blood components of interest include plasma protein portion, antihemophilic factor AHF, Factor VIII Factor IX and Factor IX complex Factors II, VII, IX and X fibrinogens, Factor XIII, prothrombin and thrombin Factor II and IIa immunoglobulins e.g. IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM and fragments thereof e.g. Fab, F ab 2, Fc hyper immune globulins as used against tetanus and hepatitis B cryoprecipitate albumin interferons lymphokines transfer factors etc. Other biological compositions include vaccines, recombinant DNA produced proteins, oligopeptide ligands, etc.The protein concentration in the aqueous medium will generally range from about 1 pg ml to 500 mg ml, more usually from about 1 mg ml to 100 mg ml. The pH will normally be clpse to physiologic pH 7.4 , generally in the range of about 6 to 9, more usually about 7. Other components may be present in the medium, such as salts, additives, buffers, stabilizers, or the like. These components will be conventional components, which will be added for specific functions. The furocoumarins will include psoralen and derivatives, where the substituents will be alkyl, particularly of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl alkoxy, particularly of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, e.g.methoxy and substituted alkyl, of 1 to 6, more usually 1 to 3 carbon atoms having from 1 to 2 heteroatoms, which will be oxy, particularly hydroxy or alkoxy of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, e.g. hydroxymethyl and methoxymethyl, or amino, including mono and dialkyl amino having a total of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g.aminomethyl. There will be from 1 to 5, usually 2 to 4 substituents, which will normally be at the 4, 5, 8, 4 and 5 positions, particularly at the 4 position.Illustrative compounds include 5 methoxypsoralen, 8methoxypsoralen 8 MOP , 4, 5 ,8 trimethylpsoralen TMP , 4 hydroxymethyl 4,5 8 trimethylpsoralen HMT , 4 aminomethyl 4,5 ,8 trimethylpsoralen AMT , 4 methylpsoralen, 4,4 dimethylpsoralen, 4,5 dimethylpsoralen, 4 ,8 dimethylpsoralen, and 4 methoxymethyl 4, 5 , 8 tri methylpsoralen. The subject furocoumarins are active with a wide variety of viruses and other polynucleotides, DNA or RNA, whether single stranded or double stranded.Illustrative viruses include adenovirus, arenavirus, bacteriophage, bunyavirus, herpesvirus, orthomyxovirus, papovavirus, paramyxovirus, picornavirus, poxvirus, reovirus, retrovirus, rhabdovirus, and togavirus.Additional pathogenic microorganisms include bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, protozoa, rickettsia and other unicellular microorganisms. Furocoumarins may also be effective in inactivating Hepatitis B and Non A Non BHepatitis viruses. This inactivation method may also be used against uncharacterized infectious agents which may contain nucleic acid such as the agent which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome . In addition to the furocoumarins, additives may be included which scavenge for singlet oxygen or other highly reactive oxygen containing species. Such additives include ascorbate, glutathione, sodium thionite, etc. In some instances these additives may have adverse effects, so that in each instance, their use will be determined empirically. Where such additives are present, they will be present in amounts ranging from about 20pg to 20mg per ml. The furocoumarins may be used individually or in combination, preferably in combination. Each of the furocoumarins may be present in amounts ranging from about 0.Olpg ml to lmg ml, preferably from about 0.5pg ml to 100pg ml, there not being less than about lpg ml nor more than about lmg ml of furocoumarins. For RNA, the preferred furocoumarins are AMT and HMT. For DNA, the preferred furocoumarin is TMP. For mixtures of DNA andRNA containing polynucleotides, or for inactivation of infectious agents or possibly infectious agents of unknown or uncertain nucleic acid classification, or for protection against infections of unknown etiology, preferably TMP and AMT are used in combination. In carrying out the invention, the furocoumarins may be added to the biological composition by any convenient means in a manner substantially assuring the uniform distribution of the furocoumarins in the composition. The composition may then be irradiated under conditions ensuring that the entire composition is exposed to sufficient irradiation, so that the furocoumarins may react with any polynucleotide present to inactivate the polynucleotide. Depending upon the nature of the medium, particularly its opacity, as in the case of blood, the depth of the solution subject to irradiation will vary widely. Usually, the depth will be not less than about 0.025 millimeter, but may be a centimeter or more. With whole blood, the depth will generally range from about 0.025 millimeter to 2.5 millimeters.The light which is employed will generally have a wavelength in the range of about 300nm to 400nm.The intensity will generally range from about 0.1mW cm2 to about 5W cmê. In order to prevent denaturation, the temperature should be maintained below about 600C, preferably below about 400C, usually from about 100C to 300C. The medium being irradiated may be irradiated while still, stirred or circulated, and may either be continuously irradiated or be subject to alternating periods of irradiation and non irradiation. The circulation may be in a closed loop system or it may be in a single pass system ensuring that all of the sample has been exposed to irradiation. The total time for irradiation will vary depending upon the nature of the sample, the furocoumarin derivative used, the intensity and spectral output of the light source and the nature of the polynucleotides which may be present.Usually, the time will be at least lmin. and not more than about 6hrs., more usually from about 15minus. to about 2hrs.When circulating the solution, the rate of flow will generally be in the range of about 0.1 ml min to 50 liters min It may be desirable to remove the unexpended psoralen and or its photobreakdown products from the irradiation mixture. This can be readily accomplished by dialysis across an appropriately sized membrane or through an appropriately sized hollow fiber system after completion of the irradiation. It may be desirable in certain applications to remove bound or unbound furocoumarins using antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, either in solution or attached to a substrate. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. EXPERIMENTAL The following experiments were performed in order to demonstrate the ability of the psoralen photoreaction to destroy microbial contaminants contained in whole blood and blood products. 1 Feline reinotracheitis virus, a member of the herpesvirus family, was added to heparinized whole rabbit blood in an amount that would give a final concentration of approximately 2 x 107PFU ml. 4 hydroxymethyl 4,5 , 8 trimethylpsoralen HMT was added to a portion of the rabbit blood and aliquots were irradiated for various periods of time. To test for remaining live virus, duplicate plaque assays were performed using cultured feline cells Fc3Tg ATCC CCL 176 , with a methylcellulose overlay. Virus titers were obtained as the arithmetical mean of viral plaques observed in duplicate assay cultures 72 hours after exposure to test samples.The results are as follows The blood aliquot that received HMT only and no irradiation gave a titer of 5.3 x 106PFU ml. The aliquot that received HMT and five minutes of irradiation exhibited a titer of 4.5 x 106PFU ml. In the aliquot that received psoralen plus one hour of irradiation there was no detectable live virus remaining. The sensitivity of this assay should have permitted detection of residual virus at titers 1.0 x 101PFU ml. A blood sample which had received HMT and one hour of irradiation also showed no apparent damage to the red blood cells as judged by phase contrast microscope analysis and by absence of visible hemolysis. These data therefore demonstrate that high virus titers present in whole blood can be inactivated by psoralen plus light treatment which leaves the red cell component of the blood intact. 2 In the second experiment Blue TongueVirus Serotype 11 , a member of the reovirus family, and Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus, and Simian Virus 40 were added to a solution of Profilate a commercial preparation of human clotting factor VIII produced byAlpha Therapeutics . The lyophilized preparation ofProfilate 180 units was dissolved in 10ml of sterile water included with the commercial preparation. This solution was further diluted with barbital buffer 11.75g sodium barbital and 14.67g NaCl dissolved in 2 liters of de ionized water and filtered through a 0.22 micron filter to a final concentration of 5 units per milliliter. One portion 2ml was set aside at room temperature in the dark. This was sample 1. A second 2ml portion was pumped through the apparatus described below for 1 hour with irradiation. This was sample 2.Through addition of appropriate amounts of reagents a third 2ml portion was adjusted to contain 10pg ml AMT and 10pg ml HMT and was also irradiated for 1 hour.This was sample 3. The fourth 2ml portion was adjusted to lOg ml AMT, 10pg ml HMT, and lOmM sodium ascorbate and was also irradiated for 1 hour. This was sample num 4. All the samples were kept at 200C throughout the manipulations. The total elapsed time from dissolving of the lyophilized preparation to the completion of the clotting factor VIII assays was 6 and one half hours. The clotting factor VIII assays were performed at a variety of dilutions ranging from 1 5 to 1 100 for each sample and were compared with the activity in normal human serum and with pooled normal human serum.The results are summarized in Table 1.

This was higher than the percent activity retained by the sample that was only irradiated 68 retained for sample 2 and indicates that the psoralen photochemistry has little or no effect on the activity of factor VIII. Surprisingly, the presence of sodium ascorbate a scavenger of singlet oxygen which has been shown to protect enzymes from inactivation in the presence of psoralens and light during the irradiation causes the factor VIII activity to drop to 11 of the level in the control sample. Samples otherwise identical to samples 1, 2, and 3 above were seeded with 2 x 106PFU ml of Feline 7Rhinotracheitis Virus FeRT , 1 x 10 PFU ml of Blue Tongue Virus BTV , and 4 x 108PFU ml of Simian Virus 40 SV 40 . Table 2 shows the results of the plaque assays on those samples. Table 2. Effect of Photochemical Inactivation Procedure and its components on Infectivity of Virus in Factor VIII preparation. Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3 F , UVA F F , WA FeRT Titer 8.6 x 105 3.5 x 105 0.0BTV Titer 3.8 x 107 1.4 x 107 1.1 x 102SV 40 Titer 2.5 x 108 1.6 x 108 1.2 x 103 F Furocoumarin WA long wavelength ultraviolet light. Infectivity determined by plaque assays in tissue culture. In the case of FeRT the number of tectable virus particles was reduced by more than five orders of magnitude to beneath the limit of detection in the plaque assay. The BTV infectivity was reduced by about five orders of magnitude to 110 PFU ml. The SV40 infectivity was reduced to a titer of 1.2 x 103. Thus, it is shown that multiple, widely distinct types of virus can be simultaneously inactivated by at least five orders of magnitude in the presence of factorVIII, using the simple, convenient, brief process described above, with retention of at least 84 of factor VIII activity. Based on the above observations, it is predictable that by extending, repeating or modifying the treatment, the probability of an infectious virus particle remaining can be reduced to an arbitrarily low value.In this manner suitable safety margins can be achieved for any of the cited applications. Apparatus and System Since whole blood exhibits very high optical density for longwave W light absorption is high for visible light in the 400nm to 500nm range , the blood was irradiated though a suitably short optical path length. In this experiment blood was pumped through polyethylene capillary tubing of 0.875 millimeter inside diameter. The tubing was coiled around a 1.27 centimeter diameter tube and immersed in water which was maintained at 180C. The blood was continuously circulated through the tubing by means of a peristaltic pump. The blood required approximately 2.5 minutes for a complete cycle through the capillary tubing and was in the light beam for approximately 20 of the stated irradiation time. The light source was a low pressure mercury lamp filtered through a cobalt glass filter.The filter transmits light of approximately 320nm 380nm, with peak transmittance at 360nm. The incident intensity at the sample was approximately 40mW cm2. It is evident from the above results, and in accordance with the subject invention, that polynucleotides in biochemical compositions can be inactivated to provide a safe composition for administration to a mammalian host. The proteins present in the composition retain their physiological activity, so that they can fulfill their physiological function in a mammalian host. The method is simple, rapid, and can be expanded to treat large samples. The small amount of chemical reagent required will not generally be harmful to the host. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
