# Process for preparing 2 alkylamino and 2 amino 5 alkylpyridines.

## Abstract
An improved process for preparing the 2 alkylamino 5 alkylpyridine and 2 amino 5 alkylpyridine amination pro ducts of 3 alkylpyridines, comprising the step of initially reacting the base directly with the sodium salt of a primary alkylamine to produce the 2 alkylamino form, wherein the alkyl group in each reactant has from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms. The sodium salt is preferably preformed in situ by adding the alkylamine to a dispersion of sodium in an organic solvent heated to about 100 120 C. The substituted amination preferably proceeds at a temperature of about 100 140 C in a solvent such as toluene and under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The ratio of 2,5 2,3 isomer products of the reaction is up to about 10 1 or more, with the effective yield of the 2,5 alkylated isomer being about 25 or more. This recovered 2 alkylamino 5 alkylpyridine product is readi ly dealkylated by reaction with hydrobromic or hydriodic acid with or without the presence of a pyridine hydriohalide salt to obtain the 2 amino 5 alkylpyridine product which has proven uses in herbicidal, insecticidal and pharmaceutical applications.
