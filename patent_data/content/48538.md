The radicals represented by R and R1 are preferably lower alkyl radicals, that is to say alkyl radicals containing from one to four carbon atoms. It is often preferred that R and R are unsubstituted or cubstituted by OH, COCH, COOAlkyl,CN, OSO3H or One class of water soluble azo dyes of the invention is the class of monoazo dyes represented by the formula EMI1.2 wherein X, R and Z have the meanings given above, A represents the residue of a diazo component and n is 1 or 2. The symbol A, representing the residue of a diazo component, thus denotes an optionally substituted aromatic cathocyclic or heterocyclic radical. The preferred monoazo dyes have the formula EMI2.1 wherein X,R,Z,A and n have the meanings given above. Those dyes of Formula III which contain a single sulphonic acid group are of greatest value for the coloration of polyamide materials. The aromatic radical rbpresented by A may belong to the benzene or naphthalene series and, in addition to carrying one or two sulpho or sulphato substituents as in Formula III, it may carry other substituents appropriate to diazo components. Examples of such substituents include chlorine, bromine, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, COOR2 whereR2 represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl or aralkyl, CONR3R4 where each of and and R independently, represents hydrogen or optionally substiuted alkyl or aryl, SO2NR5R6 where each ofR5 and R6, independently represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl or aryl, SO2OR where is optionally substituted 8 8 2 R aryl, SO2R where R represents optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl, NHR9 where R9 represents alkyl, aralkyl or optionally substituted aryl and NHCOR10 where R10 represents alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, amino, alkylamino or arylamino. AB examples of optionally substituted heterocyclic radicals which may be represented by A there may be mentioned 2 thienyl, 2 thiazolyl, 2 benzthiazolyl, 5 imidazolyl and 5 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl . Another class of dyes within the scope of the invention is the class of disazo dyes represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein X,R,Z and n have the meanings given above and A1 represents a radical of the azobenzene, azonaphthalene or phenylazonaphthalene series which may carry substituents appropriate to diazo components as indicated above. A further class of dyes of the invention is the class of d sazo dyes represented by the formula EMI3.2 wherein X,R,Z and n have the meanings given above and A2 represents a divalent aromatic radical. The ZSO,H groups are preferably 3n attached to A forming for example a disulphostilbene radical. The dyes of the invention may be prepared by diazotising an aromatic amine and coupling the resulting diazo compound with a coupling component of the formula EMI4.1 wherein X and R have the meanings given above, the amine and the coupling component together containing either one or two suipho or sulphato groups. As examples of types of aromatic amine which may be used in making monoazo dyes, there may be mentioned aniline sulphonic acids toluidine sulphonic acids, anisidine sulphonic acids, chloro or bromo aniline or toluidine sulphonic acids1 dichloro or dibromo aniline sulphonic acids, nitroaniline sulphonic acids, naphthylamine sulphonic acids. sulphonic acids based on 4phenoxysulphonyl aniline, 4 phenylaminosulphonylaniline and 4 benzylsulphonylaniline each of which may carry one or two chlorine substituents, phenoxyaniline sulphonic acid, 2,5 dichloro 4 sulphoethylaminosulphonyl aniline, 2,5 dichloro 4 sulphato ethylaminosuiphonyl aniline, 2,5 dichloro 4 sulphoethylsulphonyl aniline, 2 nitro 4 aminodiphenylamine 4 sulphonic acid, 2 aminothiazole sulphonic acids, 2 aminobenzthiazole sulphonic acids and 2 amino 1,3,4 thiazole 5 sulphonic acid. Examples of amines which may be used in making disazo dyes include 4 aminoazobenzene 4 sulphonic acid and 4,4 diaminostilbene 2,2 disulphonic acid. Examples of coupling components which may be used in making the dyes of the invention include 2 ethylthio 4,6diaminopyrimidine and 2 d iethylamino 4, 6 diamino pyrimidine. The coupling reactions leading to the formation of the dyes of the invention may be performed using conditions that have been fully described in the prior art for such reactions. Similarly, the dyes may be isolated by known methods and, as in the case of other dyes containing sulphonic acid groups,it is often convenient to isolate and use the dyes in the form of their water soluble salts1 particularly their alkali metal or ammonium salts and especially sodium salts. It is to be understood that the invention relates to both the free acids and their salts. The coupling components of formula VI may be obtained by known methods. For example when X is NR1 they may be obtained by reaction of malonitrile with a dialkylguanidine salt or when X is S by the reaction of mnlonitrile with thiourea followed by reaction with an alkyl halide. An alternative process for manufacturing the dyes of the invention in which X is NR1 comprises diazotising an aromatic amine and reacting the resulting diazo compound with malonitrile followed by reaction with a alkyl guanidine salt This alternative process will often give enhanced yields compared with the first process. Typical conditions for the reaction between the diazotised aromatic amine are at e50e in aqueous medium at mildly acid pH e.g. 4.0.The product of this first stage is isolated as an insoluble solid by strong acidification. The second stage i.e.reaction with dialkyl guanidine salt is typically carried out by suspending the first stage product in an alcohol e.g. methanol containing dissolved sodium, adding dialkyl guanidine salt and refluxing. The resulting dyestuff may be isolated by pouring the reaction mixture into water and filtering. The dyes of the invention are suitable for applying to polyamide textile materials such as wool and silk but especially to synthetic polyamide textile materials, for example nylon 66 nylon 6 and nylon 11, using any of the general methods known for the application of acid dyes to such materials. The dyes provide yellow shades having a high degree of fastness to wet treatments and to light. The preferred dyes are those in which X represents sulphur. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts are by weight. Example 7 5 Parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added to a solution of 2.64 parts of the sodium salt of 2,5 dichlorosulphanilic acid in 100 parts of water at 20 C.

The diazonium salt suspension is added to a stirred solution of 1.7 parts of 4,6 diamino2 thioethylpyrimidine in 100 parts of acetone at 0 5 C. Saturated sodium acetate solution is added to adjust the pH to 4 5 on completion of coupling the pH is raised to 7 8 by the addition of 8 sodium hydroxide solution. After stirring for 1 hour further, the product is filtered off and dried. 4.55 g of a yellow powder of the formula EMI7.1 which dyes polyamide a bright greenish yellow shade are obtained.Example 2 5 Parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added to a solution of 2.64 parts of the sodium salt of 2,5 dichlorosulphanilic acid in 100 parts of water at 200C.
