# System for baling textile waste from a plurality of sources.

## Abstract
A system for segregating and baling textile wastes suppl ied from a plurality of separate sources includes a plurality of filling stations 10 which receive the wastes from the separate sources. An upwardly opening portable waste receiving bin 11 is mounted within each filling station 10 with the lower end of each bin carrying a detachable bottom platen 59 . As transfer mechanism 26 moves each bin selectively, back and forth between its filling station 10 and a compression station 27 where the wastes are compressed within the bin 11 . Actuator units 97 in the compression station disconnect the bin 11 from its platen 59 and raise the bin to an upper position about a movable ram 88 to thus expose the bale B for final bale out.
