# Electromagnetic clutch control system for automobiles.

## Abstract
A system is described for controlling an electromagnetic clutch of an engine for a motor vehicle having a transmission. The system has various sensors such as an engine speed sensor 48 , a vehicle speed sensor 50 for detecting low vehicle speed, an accelerator pedal position sensor 52 for detecting the acceleration of the engine, and a selector lever position sensor 53 . The system has computing means 41 for determing the clutch current at the beginning of the engagement of the elec tromagnetic clutch. The clutch current is determined so that a larger clutch current is supplied at lower engine speeds, and a smaller clutch current is supplied at higher engine speeds at the beginning of the engagement of the clutch.
