# An elongate resilient section at the closure edge of a closure.

## Abstract
An elongate resilient section at the closure edge of closure movable to close an opening contains at least one electrical switching strip 11 which is arranged in associated hollow cavity 13, 14 112 close to the elongate securing block 20 120 used to secure the resilient section to the closure edge. The resilient section is so constructed that the electrical switching strip or strips 11 11, 12 respond s not only to compressive forces acting in the direction of closure but also to forces acting sideways on the resilient section.
