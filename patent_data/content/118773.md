# Stick type vehicle hand brake.

## Abstract
A vehicle hand brake lever assembly 10 for actuating a vehicle parking brake includes an axially slidable plunger 12 mounted via a ratched mechanism on a support and having one end connected with a brake actuating member. The ratched mechanism can be released by rotating the plunger 12 about its longitudinal axis. A handle assembly at the other end of the plunger comprises a handle shaft 11c . A sleeve 19 fitted together with a guide member 20 is secured to the plunger end, and a lock member 22 fixed at the handle shaft is received slidably in the guide member and cooperates while being spring 23 biased with a cam profile 19a,22a on the sleeve. Further, projections 22b of the lock member 22 can be brought into engagement with respective cutouts in the sleeve by pulling the handle shaft against the biasing force thereby connecting the handle shaft 11c with the plunger 12 which now is able to be rotated so that the ratched mechanism can be released.
