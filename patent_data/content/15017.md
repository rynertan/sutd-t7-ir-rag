## Description
Heat pipe solar collector system , The invention relates to a solar energy collecting system, comprising at least one solar collector with at least one heat pipe which comprises an end portion which is sealed at its free end and which comprises an evaporation zone, and an end portion with a condensation zone which is arranged at a level which is higher than that of the evaporation zone during operation, a quantity of evaporable heat transport medium which is present in the heat pipe and which evaporates in the evaporation zone during operation and which condenses in the condensation zone by giving off heat to a liquid medium flowing through a duct. A solar energy collecting system of the described kind is known from United States Patent Specification 4,119,085. The heat pipe of the known system consists of a sealed tube. The condenser part of the tube has connected to it a metal flange which provides, by intimate contact with a metal element on the duct system for the heat absorbing medium, a heat conductive connection between a heat transport medium in the tube and the heat absorbing medium in the duct system. The metal flange and the metal element are firmly held together, for example, by means of bolts, and the transfer of heat can be improved by application of a suitably heat conductive agent, such as grease, between the flange and the element. The known solar energy collecting system has some drawbacks. The heat exchanger formed by the condenser wall, the flange, the element and the wall of the duct system makes the construction complex and expensive. Moreover, the heat exchanger introduces thermal efficiency losses.Furthermore, when a plurality of solar collectors are used in a panel, a comparatively large part of the panel surface is occupied by the heat exchanger, so that the effective collector surface is comparatively small. Moreover, the weight of such a solar panel is comparatively large. The present invention has for its object to provide an improved solar energy collecting system of the described kind which has a simpler and cheaper con struction, a higher thermal efficiency and a reduced weight and volume. In order to realize this object, the solar collector in accordance with the invention is characterized in that at the area of the condensation zone the heat pipe is in open communication with theduct for a direct exchange of heat between the two media. The condenser end portion of the heat pipe can be simply connected to the duct system in open communication therewith. During operation, the vapour developed in the heat pipe condenses against the colder liquid in the duct system in direct contact with this liquid. Due to the absence of a heat exchanger wall between the vapour and the liquid, the thermal efficiency of the system is high and the system as such has a simple construction, is compact and its weight is low. The invention furthermore relates to a heat pipe solar collector which is suitable for use in the solar energy collecting system. The invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawing which diagrammatically shows, by way of example, two embodiments of the solar energy collecting system not to scale . Figure la is a longitudinal sectional view of a heat pipe solar collector which is in open communication with a duct system. Figure ib is a cross sectional view of the heat pipe solar collector at the area of the line Ib Ib ofFigure Ia. Figure 2 is a plan view of a solar panel which comprises a plurality of heat pipe solar collectors which are all in open communication with one central duct. The reference numeral 1 in Figure 1 denotes a heat pipe which comprises an evaporation zone la and a condensation zone Ib. The evaporation zone 7a is connected in a heat conductive manner with a flat plate 2 for absorbing solar radiation incident during operation. The absorber plate 2 is connected to the tube 1, for example, by soldering or welding. The solar radiation absorbing side of the plate 2 is preferably black. The portion of the tube 1 which comprises the evaporation zone la is accommodated, together with the absorber plate 2,in an evacuated transparent envelope 3 of glass or a synthetic material, the lower half of which is provided on the inner side with a solar radiation reflective layer 4 of, for example, aluminium or silver Figure 1b If desired, the inner side of the bulb may be provided completely or only the upper half with a light transmitting but infrared reflective layer of, for example, indium oxide. The projecting part of the tube 1 is connected to and is in open communication with a duct 5 which forms part of a duct system not shown for, for example, hot water supply or central heating in which a liquid such as water can circulate. When the installation is put into operation, the heat pipe is filled with liquid due to the inclined arrangement of the solar collector. Due to the incident solar radiation, the liquid in the evaporation zone la is heated and starts to boil at a given temperature which is dependent of the pressure in the open or closed system which includes the duct 5. The vapour formed rises in the tube l and condenses against the colder liquid circulating in the duct 5 while giving off heat. The condensation area is diagrammatically denoted by the reference ib. Due to the circulation of the liquid in the duct 5, this liquid is uniformly heated. The condensate returns to the evaporation zone under the influence of gravity. Thus, the evaporation zone remains filled with liquid during normal operation. The liquid in the duct 5 can circulate through the system under the influence of a pumping device. However, the circulation can alternatively be realized by a thermal siphon effect on the basis of differences in the density of cold and hot liquid in the system. Warmer liquid having a lower specific weight then rises through colder liquid having a higher specific weight. Obviously, the heat pipe 1 may also be detachablÂµ connected to the duct 5. Figure 2 is a plan view of a solar panel with a container 20 which accommodates a plurality of heat pipe solar collectors 21 which are all connected to and are in open communication with a central duct 22. The central duct 22 comprises a liquid inlet 23 and an outlet 24, which are passed through the upright walls 20a of the coSSiner 20o In addition to the solar collector systems shown, obviously, a variety of other embodiments are feasible. For example, a plurality of heat pipes may be mounted on one and the same flat absorber plate for example, as shown in Figure 1 of German Offenlegungsschrift 26 07 976 , the end portions of these heat pipes which act as condensers being in open communication with the duct wheretlirough the heat absorbing liquid medium flows.
