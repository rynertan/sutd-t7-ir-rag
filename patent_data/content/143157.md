# Charge pumping circuit for a substrate voltage generator.

## Abstract
In the pumping circuit a charge is pumped from the substrate of a VLSI chip through a PN diode D3 to a node B in response to periodic input signals coupled through a purnping FET capacitor T1 to said node B , said pumped charge then passing through a current sinking FET transis tor T2 to a reference potential, thereby providing a desired substrate voltage to said substrate. The pumping FET capacitor T1 has a high capacitance by means of a triple plate structure. In addition a space saving technique of providing a dual use for the source diffusion of the current sinking device in the circuit is ap plied so as to also serve as the guard ring around the charge pumping circuit of the substrate voltage generator.
