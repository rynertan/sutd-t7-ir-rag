# Male incontinence device.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for providing a male inconti nence shield for use with a user s undergarment including partially overlapping inner and outer moisture abosrbent pad portions coupled together at opposite ends whereby a penile opening is formed to allow normal urination for the lightly incontinent male. Each pad portion comprises an absorbent core with a first relatively thick absorbent portion and a layer of super absorbent material which gels immobi lizing the absorbed liquid. A cover encloses the core comprising a moisture permeable body side section and a moisture impermeable garment side section. In one embodi ment, for the inner pad portion, the moisture peremeable section extends around one side of the pad to form a portion of the garment side section in the region of overlap. Adhesive means attached to the garment side of the shield are provided for securing the shield to the undergarment. In a preferred method of manufacture, a moisture permeable sheet of material is sealed to a moisture impermeable sheet along a top edge and longitudinal center portion extending away from the top edge. Moisture absorbent cores are placed between the sheets on either side of the center portion and a slit is placed in the sheets in the center portion. The sheets are sealed together at least partially around the remaining periphery of the cores. One core is partially folded over the other and the combintion heat sealed along top and bottom edges. The excess sheet material is trimmed off along the peripheral sealing lines to form the shield.
