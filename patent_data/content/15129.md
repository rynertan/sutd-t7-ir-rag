# Optical circulator.

## Abstract
An optical circulator comprising a first optical path and a second optical path formed between a first polarizer element P1 and a second polarizer element P2 , Faraday rotators FR1, FR2 interposed in the first and second optical paths, the polarizing direction of the Faraday rotators being rotated by an angle of 45 by a magnetic field and the direction of polariz ing rotation being reversed with respect to the travelling direction of light which passes therethrough, and polarizing direction rotators OA1, OA2 interposed in the first and sec ond optical paths, the polarizing direction of the polarizing drection rotators being rotated by an angle of 45 and the direction of polarizing rotation being non reversed with respect to the travelling direction of light which passes there through.
