# Programmable controller.

## Abstract
An improved programmable controller having the ability to use two different data bases while presenting to the outside world a uniform word size. The programmable controller includes pipeline processing and hardware solution of a user control program in a network node format. A memory management scheme is provided allowing for the direct addressability of one half million words by utilization of a page register. The programmable controller can be incorporated into a network containing other programmable controllers. The programmable controller also incorporates a multi task interrupt so that the processor can handle more than one job at any particular time. Input output tasks are handled logically in the scan solving the user networks rather than being based upon a particular physical area of the controller memory.
