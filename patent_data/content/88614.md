# Stability augmentation systems for navigable crafts.

## Abstract
A stability augmentation system utilising a limited author ity series actuator 25 has an adaptive washout circuit 40 which automatically reduces the effective washout system washout time constant as a function of attitude error or series actuator displacement. For small errors and for disturbances due to gusting winds, the system washout time constants are slow, thus providing good stability. For large errors the circuit smoothly reduces the time constants to keep the series actuator 25 from saturating.
