# Cowl of a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
A cowl connecting a pair of front pillars of a motor vehicle comprises outer and inner panels 2, 8 which define an air duct 9 . The outer panel has a bulge 2a protruding upwardly and continuously extending in a lateral direction of the vehicle, and a downward recess B adjacent to the bulge 2a in which a wind shield wiper of a consealed type 1, 3 is supported. The inner panel has a bulge 8a protrud ing downwardly toward a gap between a dash panel 6 and an air conditioner 7 . The bulge of the inner panel con tinuously extends in the lateral diretion of the vehicle. A total cross sectional area of the two bulges is larger than that of the recess, thereby securing a function of the air duct for med by the two panels with keeping a design choice for arranging the wind shield wiper of a consealed type.

## Description
COWL OF A MOTOR VEHICLEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to construction of a cowl of a motor vehicle, and more particularly to a cowl in which a consealed type wiper is adopted, including a cowl outer panel and cowl inner panel.2. Description of the Prior Art In general, a cowl is an important member for torsional rigidity of a vehicle body as being for connecting right and left front pillars of the vehicle to each other, and a gap between the cowl outer panel and cowl inner panel is used as an air duct. In working on consealing a wind shield wiper to be a consealed type wiper, if mounting positions of a wind shield glass and a wiper pivot are to be shifted forwardly and downwardly, then, with the rectangular cross section of a conventional cowl, the cross sectional area of the air duct formed by the cowl outer panel and cowl inner panel is decreased. As a result, the air conditioning performance through the air duct and the torsional rigidity of the vehicle body are deteriorated. In order to prevent these problems, therefore, the design choice of the conseald type wiper has been restricted in the conventional cowl.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been developed to obviate the above described disadvantages of the prior art and has as its object the provision of a cowl construction wherein the consealed type wind shield wiper is accomodated without design restriction while securing the air conditioning performance and the torsional rigidity of a vehicle body. To achieve the above described object, according to the present invention, the outer panel has a bulge protruding upwardly and continously extending in a lateral direction of the vehicle, and a downward recess adjacent to the bulge in which a wind shield wiper of a consealed type is supported. The inner panel has a bulge protruding downwardly toward a gap between a dash panel and an air conditioner.The bulge of the inner panel continuously extends in the lateral direction of the vehicle. A total cross sectional area of the two bulges is larger than that of the recess, thereby securing a function of the air duct formed by the two panels with keeping a design choice for arranging the wind shield wiper of a consealed type.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a cowl of an embodiment according to the present invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention will be described in detail in conjunction with one embodiment shown in the drawing. The drawing is a sectional view showing one embodiment of a cowl construction of a motor vehicle according to the present invention. Referring to the drawing, designated at reference numeral 1 is a wind shield wiper arm rotatably mounted through a wiper pivot 4 on a wiper support portion 3 affixed to an outer panel 2, numeral 5 is a wind shield glass, from the outer surface of which deposits are wiped off by a wiper blade, not shown, mounted on the wiper arm 1, numeral 6 is a dash panel, and numeral 7 is an air conditioner or heater. This arrangement is similar to that in the prior art, so that the detailed description thereof will be omitted. This embodiment features that a portion of a cowl inner panel 8 opposed to a gap formed between the dash panel 6 and the air conditioner 7 protrudes downwardly to form a bulge 8a in such a manner that, when the wind shield glass 5 and the wiper pivot 4 are designed to be positioned forwardly and downwardly as indicated by an arrow A , an air duct 9 formed by the cowl outer panel 2 and the cowl inner panel 8 is not decreased in cross sectional area. The bulge Sa of the cowl inner panel 8 extends continuously in the lateral direction of the vehicle.A portion of the cowl outer panel 2 opposed to the aforesaid bulge 8a protrudes upwardly to form a bulge 2a extending continuously in the lateral direction of the vehicle. In arranging the cowl outer panel 2 and the cowl inner panel 8 as described above, as compared with the conventional cowl construction, a hatched portion B corresponds to a decreased value of the air duct 9 in cross sectional area due to the forward and downward positioning of the wind shield glass 5 and the wiper pivot 4. This hatched portion B defines a recess adjacent to the bulge 2a in which the wiper support portion 3 of the consealed type wind shield wiper can be supported. Hatched portions C and D correspond to an increased value of the air duct 9 in cross sectional area. Accordingly, the cross sectional area of the air duct 9 as a result is represented by C D B, so that the aforesaid air duct 9 is not decreased in cross sectional area. Therefore, if the wind shield glass 5 and the wiper pivot 4 are positioned forwardly and downwardly, the air conditioning performance and the tortional rigidity of the vehicle body are not deteriorated, and the design choice of the wiper increases.
