# Wholly aromatic polyamide composition and filaments or fibres thereof.

## Abstract
A wholly aromatic polyamide composition which is suit able for producing filaments or fibers having not only excellent heat resisting property but also, a superior dyeing property, which comprises A 50 to 95 by weight of poly m phenylene isoph thalamide, and B 5 to 50 by weight of at least one other aroma polyamide comprising 1 an amine moiety consisting of essentially of a 35 to 100 molar of at least one phenylene iamine in which the phenylene group has 1 to 4 substituents respectively selected, independently from each other, from the group consisting of halogen atoms and alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 car bon atoms, e.g. 2,4 diaminotoluene, and b 0 to 65 molar of at least one other aromatic diamine, and 2 an acid moiety consisting essentially of at least aromatic dicarboxylic acid, e.g. terephthalic or isophthalic acid.
