# METHOD OF CUTTING OUT FRONT OF CLOTHING.

## Abstract
This is a method of cutting out front of clothing and the like. A human body is drawn as a flat stereoscopic projection without breasts, then a basic original pattern piece 1 used as a body design is divided into a plurality of segments a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄ along a plurality of cutting lines 13, 14, 15, 16 toward the periphery from a bust point B P as the center, the segments a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄ are moved in response to measured personal dimensions and are placed so as to conform to the clothing of the design required. The profile of the figure is then used to obtain pattern pieces X₁, X₂, X₃, for the front, and the cloth is cut out using the pattern pieces. When clothing of a design having darts is fabricated, triangular notches 18, 21, 23 are formed in the pattern pieces X₁, X₂, X₃ to obtain darts 19, 20, 22 at the desired cutting positions indicated by the cutting lines 13, 14, 15, 16 . and these are cut out.
