## Description
The invention relates to the use of sterolins and or spiroketalins in the production of the medicaments for the treatment of psoriasis. Only recently has it become known and accepted that arachidonic acid is one of the key precursor substances in the complex pathway of the body s metabolism. Although it has been known for some time that through the action of the cyclooxygenase and including ring and endoperoxide reactions the different prostaglandines, thromboxanes and prostacyclines are formed from arachidonic acid, it has been found only recently that arachidonic acid acts also as the precursor for the so called leukotrienes. The most important difference in comparison to the synthesis of the prostaglandines is that the substrate arachidonic acid does not interact with cyclooxygenase but with lipoxygenase. Besides the classic allergy factors, such as histamine, serotonin and kinins, leukotrienes are gaining more and more importance as mediators in wide variety of allergic disorders. Compounds collectively known as leukotrienes, are derivatives of 5 hydroxy 7,9,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid which are linked in position 6 via a thioether bridge to glutathion or which are hydroxylated in position 12 via addition of a molecule of water. The importance and the mode of action of the leukotrienes in the body are not yet fully understood, but it appears that these compounds play an important role in the manifestation of several allergic reactions. It is known that histamin and leukotrienes are present in the so called basophilic granulocytes and that during allergic reactions immunglobulines of the type E attach to the outer cell membrane of the granulocytes thus increasing their permeability, liberating stored free histamin and activated leukotrienes into the blood and tissue. It is therefore suspected at present that not only biogenic amines and kinins but also leukotrienes may play an important role during allergic reactions of the spontaneous type. Diseases of this kind are for example, asthma and some atopic skin disorders. Excessive liberation of these highly active compounds probably contributes to a large extent to the so called anaphylactic shock syndrome. At present, it is also not clear by which mechanism s the leukotrienes may play an active role in so called autoimmune diseases such as for example rheumatoid arthritides, lupus erythematosus, certain anaemias, for instance leuko , thrombo or panzytopenias, certain hepatitides, myasthenia gravis, and possibly a large number of other disorders falling into this group. It was found by various workers in the field that during these diseases the concentration of leukotrienes in blood and or in tissues and fluids increased. The relationship between leukotrienes and the genesis of psoriasis has not yet been clarified, but it has been shown that in the exudate of psoriatic areas increased concentration of these compounds can be detected. The mechanism s for this observation is poorly understood. A pure selective regulator or inhibitor of the degenerated leukotriene synthesis is not yet available for clinical use. As non specific inhibitors corticosteroids and benoxaprofen are used in medication of some of these diseases because these compounds either block the liberation of arachidonic acid or in the case of benoxaprofen the conversion from arachidonic acid to leukotrienes and some of their derivatives. The use of Sterolins and spiroketalins for the treatment of asthma and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis had already been described in DE A 2759171. Unexpectedly and surprisingly it has now been found that sterolins and spiroketalins are active in the treatment of psoriasis. The glycosides of phytosterols including cholesterol and tetracyclic triterpenes for example lanosterol and cycloartenol are designated as sterolins. Sterolins or phytosterols are present in varying amounts in most plants and are frequently found in micro organisms. Sterolins can be produced synthetically using the known Koenigs Knorr synthesis reacting the corresponding aglycones and a C 1 brominated sugar acetate using silver oxide or carbonate or mercury or cadmium compounds as catalyst see UK Pat. No GB A 1595247β sitosterol glucoside . The sterolins correspond to the following general formula. in which R 1, R 2 and R 3 represent hydrogen atoms or methyl group and R 4 a hydrogen atom or a methyl , ethyl , methylene or ethylidene group and that Z represents a sugar group which can be esterified. Double bonds can be present in different positions of the basic skeleton or in the side chain, especially in position 5 if C 5 is not linked to 5 alpha hydrogen. Sterolins occur in nature mostly as monoglycosides though some oligoglycosides have been described. The most common sugar is D glucose but in the naturally occurring compounds mannose, galactose, arabinose and xylose have also been found. The natural sterolins also occur in part in the form of their esters usually with monobasic monocarboxylic acids, mainly as palmitates. The compounds can be processed into pharmaceutical compositions such as powders, tablets, capsules, sugar coated pills, solutions, emulsions, lotions, solutions for injection or infusion, ointments and creams in a manner known per se. However, it is to be noted, that sterolins and to a lesser extent spiroketalins have only a very limited solubility in water. The compounds, therefore, must be administered in a particle size which is suitable for absorption. Reduction of particle size can be made in the known way by adsorption, enhancement of absorption by addition of carriers and surfactants or milling with or without additives under the proviso that particle sizes are smaller than 100 µm but preferably below 50 µm. The compounds used according to the invention have a low degree of toxicity and wide therapeutic margins, but they only need to be administered in very small dosages for an effective treatment. The daily dosage range is about 0.01 to 10 mg, in general 0.45 to 1.0 mg are sufficient for prophylactic or maintenance treatment. The mono to tri glycosides of steroidsaponins are designated as spiroketalins which possess in the steroid skeleton of the aglycone moiety a spiroketal group connected to C 16 and C 17. These aglycones can be considered as 5 en steroid sapogenins or 5 alpha steroid sapogenins. Typical 5 en compounds are for example diosgenin, yamogenin and botogenin whereas tigogenin, hecogenin or sisalagenin are belonging to the 5 alpha compounds. In natural saponin material the aglycones are present as glycosides containing mostly three or more mono saccharide groups and these are split hydrolytically by enzymes or the stomach acid into spiroketalins. The spiroketalsteroidglycosides correspond to the following general formula in which a double bond or an alpha hydrogen can exist in the 5 position and in which Z means a sugar group, which can also be esterified. Spiroketalins can also be synthesized according to the Koenigs Knorr synthesis W Koenigs and E Knorr Chem. Ber., 1901, 34 952 or its modifications C Meystre and K Miescher Helv. Chim.

Res. 1973 27 79 87 by treating 3 β hydroxyspiroketalsteroid aglycones with either a C 1 brominated or a 1,2 orthoester mono or disaccharide acetate in the presence of silver oxide or silver carbonate or other suitable catalysts. In addition the mono and disaccharide glycoside of spiroketalins may also be obtained by controlled fermentation or acid hydrolysis procedures of the sugar richer spiroketalsteroidsaponins. The invention will now be described in more detail in the following examples. The tests were performed according to the method devised by Schroer et al, Naunyn Schmiedeberg s Arch. Pharmak. 313, 69 1980 . According to this method washed human platelets are stimulated with thrombin 0.6 iU ml . Arachidonic acid released from the platelets upon stimulation is transformed by the 12 lipoxygenase of the platelets into 12 hydro peroxy eicosatetraenoic acid 12 HPETE . Diosgeninglucoside in a dosage of 5 µM ml produced an inhibition of 13 , at a dosage of 10 µM ml an inhibition of 31 , and at 50 uM ml 60 . One of the most potent experimental lipoxygenase inhibitor known at present is 5,8,11,14 eicosatetraynoic acid ETYA which under the above detailed test conditions at a concentration of 10 µM ml produced an inhibition of 97 . Inhibition of e.g. 12 lipoxygenase was proved in further tests on human platelets or leucocyte preparations. Washed and resuspended platelets or leucocytes were incubated in one test with a saturated solution of β sitosterol β D glucoside 23,5 mg 10ml ethanol and in a second test with a 10 times oversaturated solution with addition of 0.25 µCi arachidonic acid for 5 minutes. The test mixtures were then acidified and extracted with ethyl acetate. Separation of the reaction products was performed by radio thinlayer chromatography. The results are presented in the following TABLE 1. The number of leukocytes in test 1 was 2000 and in test 2, 1600 and the number of platelets in the platelets test 1 was 140 000 and in test 2 it was 240 000. After incubation with the test substance a significant inhibition of the lipoxygenase products can be shown when using platelets leading to a near complete synthesis inhibition and accumulation of non metabolized arachidonic acid. As far as leucocytes are concerned, there is a dosage dependant inhibitory effect of the lipoxygenase whereby the changes are mainly based on 12 hydroxyeicoscatetraenoic acid 12 HETE and 12 HPETE while lesser changes are observed for HHT. The effect of β Sitosterol β D glucoside was investigated on antigen induced SRS A leukotriene mediated bronchoconstriction according to the method of Anderson et al Br. J. Pharmacol. 78,67 74, 1983 . Twenty eight to thirty three days after the single ovalbumine dose the guinea pigs were anaesthetised and surgically prepared for intravenous administration of the test compounds and measuring the ventilatory pressure. Prior to the antigen ovalbumine challenge the animals were adequately pretreated with indomethacin, pyrilamine and propanolol to eliminate the effect of other interfering mediators released during the anaphylactic reaction. The test substance was administered 1 minute before the ovalbumine challenge. The vehicle 50 DMSO in water served as a control. Phenindone was used as the standard reference substance. The results are presented in the TABLE 2.
