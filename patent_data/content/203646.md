## Description
The invention relates to an optical image magnifying element comprising a Fresnel lens, a plurality of such elements, arranged in rows and columns, being intended for assembling a plurality of separate mutually spaced pictures, reproduced by separate picture tubes, to form one unitary picture without discontinuities. The invention also relates to an information display unit provided with such an image magnifying element and to an information display panel comprising a plurality of such units. The information display panel, which is also referred to as video wall or super large screen television , is currently used for displaying information, such as entertainment programs, instructional programs, commercials, still pictures containing messages of miscellaneous kinds, in large spaces, for example those where exhibitions are held, to a larger public. The display panel may have a surface area varying between, for example, 2 m² and 200 m² and a depth of the order of 0.5 1 m. Such a panel comprises a plurality of conventional picture tubes arranged in rows and columns, the number of picture tubes being dependent on the desired size of the panel picture. Such a panel may be employed for simultaneously reproducing a plurality of different pictures of equal or different size, which are each reproduced by an equal or a different number of picture tubes, but also for the reproduction of one large picture, in which case each of the picture tubes displays a asperate part of the total picture. In particular in the last mentioned case, unless further steps are taken, the desired visual impression of a single picture is disturbed by discontinuities because the viewing screens or effective screen surfaces of the picture tubes are spaced from each other. This is because the picture tubes are accommodated in housings having walls of a specific thickness and because the viewing screens cover only part of the face plates if these picture tubes, the viewing screens having borders. Another problem associated with the display panel is that the screens of the picture tubes are curved, whereas the panel surface which faces the spectators should preferably be flat. European Patent Application no. 0,074,696 describes several possibilities of reducing the discontinuities in the panel picture and of compensating for the face plate curvature. For example, a multitude of light conducting fibres may be arranged on the face plate of a picture tube, which fibres fan out towards the audience and thus provide an image magnifying effect. As a result of this magnification the constituent pictures forming the panel picture adjoin each other without any discontinuities. This solution is particularly suitable for a panel to be viewed from a large distance. In the case of smaller viewing distances the picture elements formed by the individual light conducting fibres will be visible on the panel. On account of the desired magnification the fibres must have a specific length, so that the fibre array has a considerable thickness and consequently a comparatively large weight. The manufacture of fibre arrays, in particular if the fibres are required to have conical shapes, is rather difficult and therefore expensive when current technologies are used. As is also stated in European Patent Application no. 0,074,696, the desired magnification of the individual pictures on the picture tubes can also be achieved by means of plane Fresnel lenses, one such lens being arranged in front of every picture tube. However, when a plane Fresnel lens is employed for imaging the picture displayed on a curved screen the picture becomes distorted. Moreover, the problem of accurately positioning the Fresnel lens relative to the associated picture tube still has to be solved. In addition, the transitions between the individual Fresnel lenses are still visible in the panel picture. It is an object of the present invention to mitigate these problems and to provide an image magnifying element which is eminently suitable for use in a large screen display panel. The image magnifying element in accordance with the invention is characterized in that in two mutually perpendicular directions the Fresnel lens exhibits a curvature corresponding to the curvature of the face plate of the picture tube. By adapting the curvatures of the face plate of a picture tube and the Fresnel lens to each other the distance between the face plate and the Fresnel lens is held constant over the entire area of the image, so that the image magnification over this area is also constant and consequently the distortion is minimal. It is to be noted that the problem of aberrations and distortions arising when a plane Fresnel lens is arranged in front of a curved viewing screen has already been pointed out in United States Patent Specification no. 3,909,525. In this Patent Specification it is proposed to construct the plane Fresnel lens in such a way that it functions as an aspherical lens. However, such a lens will exhibit a rather intricate ring structure which is difficult to manufacture. The advantage of the image magnifying element in accordance with the invention is that it comprises a conventional Fresnel lens, which is already manufactured on a large scale, but which is only curved in a specific manner. In order to enable the Fresnel lens to be arranged at the correct distance from the face plate of the picture tube during assembly, in order to ensure correct image magnification and in order to ensure that the entire surface of the Fresnel lens facing the viewer is filled only with the image of the associated picture tube, the image magnifying element in accordance with the invention is characterized further in that at its edges the Fresnel lens is provided with upright side walls. The presence of the upright side walls ensures that the transitions between the Fresnel lenses are not visible in the panel picture and the height of the upright side walls defines the distance between the Fresnel lens and the face plate of the picture tube. In order to avoid discontinuities in the panel picture caused by the side walls of the adjoining Fresnel lenses, the image magnifying element in accordance with the invention is preferably characterized further in that the side walls are made of a transparent material and the outer surfaces of said side walls are reflecting. As a result of this, the upright sides walls contribute to the image formation. That part of the light from a picture tube which is incident on the upright side walls of the associated image magnifying element is now reflected towards the viewers by the outer surfaces of these upright side walls. Preferably, the optical image magnifying element is characterized further in that those edges of the side walls which are remote from the Fresnel lens exhibit a curvature corresponding to the curvature of the face plate of the picture tube for which said element is intended. This enables the Fresnel lens to be aligned automatically relative to the face plate during assembly. In order to preclude th formation of a Moiré pattern in the panel picture as a result of interference of the line pattern on the viewing screen with the annular structure of the Fresnel lens, the Fresnel lens is preferably characterized further in that the concave inner side functions as a diffusor. The invention is also embodied in information display unit comprising a picture tube and an image magnifying element which is secured thereto. This unit is characterized in that the curved surface of the Fresnel lens is concentric with the face plate of the picture tube. This unit may be characterized further in that the focal length f of the Fresnel lens, the magnification N of this lens and the distance A preferred embodiment of the display unit is characterized in that the image magnifying element is secured to the picture tube by resilient means which are attached to the side walls of the image magnifying element and to the picture tube. This ensure correct alignment of the picture tube and the image magnifying element relative to each other because the spring forces are equal to one another. The invention is also embodied in an information display panel comprising a plurality of display units which each comprise an image magnifying element and which are arranged in rows and columns. The use of the invention ensures that this panel displays a picture without discontinuities. Embodiments of the invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The display panel In Fig. 2 of the Fresnel lens 6 and the faceplate 5 of the picture tube are shown in a cross sectional view. The central axis of the faceplate coincides with the optical axis 00 of the Fresnel lens. This lens has curved surfaces 7 and 8 which are concentric with the surface of the faceplate. The distance The Fresnel lens comprises a substrate plate of, for example, a plastics material and, for example, the surface 8 facing the viewer is provided with a multitude of annular facets 9, some of which are shown in Fig. 2. These facets are refractive elements by means of which the radiation traversing them is refracted through specific angles. For further details of the operation of this type of lens reference is made to the standard literature on optics. The Fresnel lens magnifies the image within the limits of points 10 by a factor N M M . This magnification depends on the focal length of the Fresnel lens and the distance In order to ensure that this distance is maintained over the entire surface area of the Fresnel lens 6, the Fresnel lens is provided with upright side walls 11 and 12, as shown in Fig. 3. This Figure is a perspective view of the faceplate 5 and the Fresnel lens 6. The side walls 11 and 12 extend at an angle smaller than 90 to the surface of the Fresnel lens, so that the area bounded by the edges 13 and 14 of said side walls is smaller than the area of the Fresnel lens. Further, the side walls 11 and 12 are curved in conformity with the faceplate. In this way it is achieved that the faceplate image formed by the Fresnel lens is a rectangle when projected in a plane. The edges 13 and 14 of the side walls 11 and 12 have curvatures corresponding to those of the faceplate 5 and hence also correspond to those of the surfaces 7 and 8 of the Fresnel lens. This ensures that when the side walls of the Fresnel lens are pressed against the faceplate the lens and the plate are auromatically aligned correctly relative to one another. Care must be taken that no light through the side walls from a picture tube can reach the image of the adjacent picture tube formed by the Fresnel lens, because this may give rise to blurring of the edge portions of the constituent pictures which together constitute the panel picture. It might have been considered desirable to make the side walls of a light absorbing material. However, the constituent pictures will then be surround by dark bands and the edge portions of the constituent pictures will exhibit a reduced brightness. A somewhat better solution with respect to the loss of light is to make the side walls internally reflecting, so that all the light issuing from a picture tube contributes to the image formed of the relevant picture tube. This solution has the advantage that for each side wall a dark band is formed in the panel picture, which accentuates the separation between the constituent pictures and which partly cancels the effect of the invention. In accordance with the present invention the side walls are made of a transparent material and are externally reflecting, as is shown in Fig. 4. This Figure is a cross sectional view of the faceplate 5 and the Fresnel lens 6 with its upright side walls 11. The outer surfaces of these side walls are provided with a reflective coating 15. The side walls now function as light guides, which guide the light issuing from the edge portions of the faceplate to the Fresnel lens. The side walls 11 and 12 may be secured to the Fresnel lens by means of a transparent adhesive whose refractive index approximates as closely as possible to those of the materials of the side walls and of the Fresnel lens, so that reflections from the transitions between the side walls and the Fresnel lens are minimized. In a practical embodiment of the image magnifying element the side walls are made of polymethyl methacrylate PMMA . The thickness d₁ of the lens is approximately 3 mm and the thickness d₂ of the side walls is approximately 5 mm. If the Fresnel lens is employed for magnifying the picture on a picture tube having a diagonal of 660 mm, the surface 8 has a height h of approximately 450 mm and a width b of approximately 572 mm. The radius of curvature R The use of Fresnel lenses in an information display panel has the additional advantage that the picture content of the original picture is reproduced to an optimum extent. If a picture is divided into a plurality of constituent pictures which are each reproduced by a separate picture tube, the ends of corresponding details reproduced on adjacent screens do not adjoin each other. This may be remedied by enlarging the constituent pictures formed on the picture tubes by increasing the maximum deflection of the electron beam in each picture tube. However, in that case a part of the picture content will disappear off the edges of the faceplates outside the viewing areas and this part cannot be reproduced by the panel. However, when Fresnel lenses are employed the viewing areas and the magnification of the Fresnel lens can be adapted to each other in such a way that, in principle, the entire picture content is displayed. Interference of the line pattern on the faceplate with the annular pattern of the Fresenle lens may give rise to Moiré rings in the panel picture. In order to preclude this, steps are taken to ensure that the surface 7 of the Fresnel lens which faces the picture tube functions as a diffusor. There are several possibilities of giving the inner surface 7 light diffusing properties. Preferably, a coating of a transparent substance which cures before it spreads is applied to said surface by fine atomization. There are several methods of securing the image magnifying element to the picture tube. However, an optimum fixing is obtained by resilient means which draw the element towards the faceplate at four different points with equal force so that, Fig. 5 illustrates a preferred fixing method employing tension springs. This Figure is a side view showing a part of a display unit. The faceplate again bears the reference numeral 5 the numeral 20 refers to the flave of the picture tube and 21 to the rim band of this tube at the location where the faceplate is attached to the flave. The element 6 is the Fresnel lens and the numeral 12 is a side wall which is attached to the lens and which abuts the faceplate. The broken lines 18 represent one of the other side walls 11. The side wall 12 is formed with a hole 19 in which a split pin 23 is fitted. The numerals 24 and 25 denote the bent portions of this pin. One end 26 of a tension spring 27 is hooked behind the split pin. The other end 28 of this spring is secured to the picture tube by means of a screw 29. For each side wall 12 two sets of the fixing means shown in Fig. 5 are provided, so that the Fresnel lens is drawn against the faceplate by means of four tension springs.
