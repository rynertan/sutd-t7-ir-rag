# CHARGE TRANSFER SIGNAL PROCESSING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A sampled data transversal filter utilizing charge transfer devices is described. The filter includes a charge transfer shift register including a plurality of stages to which a sequence of packets of charge representing samples of a signal is serially applied and clocked from stage to stage. Charge division and collection means are provided at the various stages of the shift register to divide and collect the fractions of charge appearing is the various stages thereof. These fractions rep resent the weighting coefficients of the various stages of the shift register. The charge collection means of the various stages are connected together to provide an output represent ing the sum of the charges collected at the various stages. The output sequence of packets of charge obtained represent the convolution of the input sequence of packets with the weight ing coefficients of the various stages of the shift register.
