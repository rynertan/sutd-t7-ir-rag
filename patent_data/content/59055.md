# CONTINUOUS, HIGH PERFORMANCE HYDROMECHANICAL SPEED GEAR

## Abstract
This invention relates to a hydromechanical speed gear for vehicles or other industrial applications consisting of three basic units, namely a unit comprising at least one planetary or epicyclic gear or differential group, a variable displacement hydrostatic transmission unit formed by at least one hydraulic pump and one hydraulic motor, preferably of reversible type, and a mechanical unit of cogwheels equivalent to a conven tional speed gear unit, the principal characteristics of this hy dromechanical speed gear being that it has infinite gear ratios and has high efficiency or performance.
