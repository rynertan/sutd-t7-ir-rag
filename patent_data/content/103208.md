# APPARATUS FOR MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE OF A MOTOR BELOW THE TEMPERATURE OF A PRIMARY GAS FLOWING PAST THE MOTOR AND A GAS COOLED FUEL CELL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An apparatus for maintaining motors at low operating temperatures during recirculation of hot gases in fuel cell operations and chemical process such as fluidized bed coal gasification. The apparatus includes a means for separating the hot process gas from the motor using a secondary lower temperature gas, thereby minimizing the temperature in crease of the motor and associated accessories.
