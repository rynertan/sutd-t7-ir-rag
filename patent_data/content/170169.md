## Description
RECOMBINANT DNA CONTAINING A HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS GENE OR A FRAGMENT THEREOF, YEAST TRANSFORMED WITH SAID RECOMBINANT DNA, AND METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PROTEINS The present invention relates to a novel recombi or a fragment thereof nant DNA containing a herpes simplex virus gene , a yeast transformed with said recombinant DNA, and a method for the production of herpes simplex virus proteins, wherein a genetic engineering technique is applied to the production of the desired herpes simplex virus proteins which have a high purity and are useful for the production of herpes simplex vaccine effective for the prophylaxis of herpes simplex virus infections. More particularly, the present invention provides a novel recombinant DNA which is obtained by inserting a gene of herpes simplex virus hereinafter, referred to as or a frageent thereof HSV ,specifically HSVgB gene,Anto a shuttle vector which can replicate in both Escherichia coli and yeast downstream of the expression control region of the repressible acid phosphatase gene said region being hereinafter referred to as acid phosphatase promoter or acid phosphatase gene carried by the vector, a novel transformed yeast which is produced by transforming a yeast with said recombinant DNA, and a method for the production of HSV proteins, particularly HSV membrane proteins in a with high yield and high purity by culturing said transformed yeast in a suitable medium. In developed countries, population having immunity against HSV has recently decreased, and hence, the frequency of serious HSV infections such as herpes genitalis, neonatal herpes infection and herpes encephalitis increased in these countries. In order to prevent such HSV infections, vaccines are useful. There have already been proposed some vaccines such as attenuated vaccines comprising attenuated HSV and inactivated vaccines containing HSV DNA. It is known, however, that HSV includes some problems such as latent infection and carcinogenicity, and that the conventional attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines include such side effects and hence are not suitable in practical viewpoint. Cells infected by HSV produce several glyco proteins e.g. gB, gC, gD, gE, etc., the nomenclature of gA and gB has been standardized as gB in International Herpes Virus Workshop Oxford, England in 1983 . Since it has been found that these glycoproteins show important functions as an antigen for inhibiting HSV infection, various studies have been done on component vaccines comprising these glyco proteins. For instance, Cappel et al. have reported that glycoproteins extracted from HSV infected cells or virus particles are effective as an antigen for preventing HSV infections cf. Cappel et al., Arch. Virol., 73, 61 1982 .However, the component vaccine comprising such glycoproteins extracted from HSV infected cells or virus particles contains plenty of proteins origined from the host cells and bears the problem of side effects due to the extra proteins. In order to obtain suitable component vaccines having no side effects, it is necessary to obtain highly purified glycoproteins. The present inventors aimed at gB which is one of the glycoproteins and have experimentally confirmed by an experiment in mice that the highly purified gB is very effective cf. Kino, Cellular Technology, 3, 120 1984 . The glycoprotein gB is usually produced by inoculating a virus into culture cells and then culturing the cells. However, this method is troublesome in the procedure because of handling infectious material and in the complicated steps, and further, it is impossible to confirm the complete removal of viral DNA carrying carcinogenic gene. Thus, it is very difficult to produce a practically the safe component vaccine from natural glycoprotein gB. The present inventors have intensively studied on safe vaccine containing no carcinogenic gene by isolating the gB gene and expressing said gene or a fragment thereof in yeast. They have accatplished the isolation of the gB gene and then found that when the isolated gB gene or a fragment thereof is combined into a specific plasmid vector containing yeast gene and E. coli gene and carrying the expression control region of the repressible acid phosphatase gene of yeast under control of said phosphatase promoter, there is obtained the desired recombinant DNA which is useful for transforming a yeast. When this transformed yeast is cultured under suitable conditions it can produce the desired HSV proteins i.e. HSVgB .The present inventors have further found that when a part of the 3 region tail of the gB gene is removed by treating the gB gene with the restriction enzyme Sac I and the resulting DNA fragment containing about 90 of the total gB gene is inserted into the Sac I site of the above plasmid vector, there is obtained a new recombinant DNA which is useful for transforming a yeast. The obtained transformed yeast can express theHSVgB proteins as a chimeric protein which shows gB activity and is useful for the preparation of herpes simplex virus vaccines. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel recombinant DNA containing a HSV gene which is suitable for transforming a yeast. Another object of the invention is to provide a novel recombinant DNA containing a frageent of an HSV gene obtained by removing a part of the 3 region of the gene. Another object of the invention is to provide a yeast transformed with said recombinant DNA. A further object of the invention is to provide a method for the production of HSV proteins, preferably chimeric proteins, using said transformed yeast.

The desired recombinant DNA of the present invention can be produced using a specific plasmid vector a an containing yeast gene and E. coli gene and carrying the expression control region of the repressible acid phos phatase gene of yeast and then recombining an HSV gene i.e.HSVgB gene, optionally losing a part about 10 of the 3 region of tlie gene into said vector under control of the phosphatase promoter. The recombinant DNA thus produced is used for transformation of a yeast. When the transformed yeast is cultured under suitable culture conditions, preferably under the conditions that the acid phosphatase promoter is not repressed, the desired HSV proteins i.e. HSVgB and HSV chimeric proteins are synthesized. The recombinant DNA, transformed yeast and the production of HSV proteins of the present invention are illustrated in more detail below with reference to preferred embodiments thereof. 1 Production of HSVgB gene containing fragments The HSVgB gene used in the present invention is theHSVgB DNA which is cloned in E. coli. A As to the gB gene of HSV KOS strain P.S.E.B.M., 1964, Vol. 115 the position on the virus DNA 0.348 0.366 map units and the base sequence have been determined by Bjik et al. cf. David J. Bjik et al.,Virology, 133, 301 314 1984 . The HSVgB gene to be inserted into a shuttle vector in the present invention is present in a fragment having about 8 kb 0.345 0.399 map units which is obtained by treating HSV DNA witht restriction enzymeBamHI, said fragment being hereinafter referred to as BamHI G fragment . The HSVgB containing fragment can be prepared by cleaving HSV DNA with BamHI, and cloning the obtained BamHIG fragment as follows. Virus DNA is isolated from HSV which has been grown on Vero cells, the virus DNA is cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI, and then the resulting BamHI G fragment is isolated and extracted by subjecting the BamHI cleaved HSV DNA to agarose gel electrophoresis. The Bamal G fragment is ligated using T4 ligase into the E. coli plasmid pBR322 which was previously treated with BamHI. E. coli X1776 is transformed with the above reaction mixture. Among the transformants thus obtained, a strain having ampicillin resistance Apr and tetracycline sensitivity is selected.The obtained strain is amplified and plasmid pG containing the BamHI G fragment is isolated. This plasmid pG has the structure shown in Fig. 1. The plasmid pG thus obtained is cleaved with BamHI and Xho I to give a fragment 3.5 kb containing theHSVgB gene. The fragment thus obtained is isolated by agarose a gel extraction and then is ligated with T4 ligase into fragment 2.6 kb of the E. coli plasmid pACYC177 Chang, A.C.Y., Cohen, S.N. J.Bacteriol.134, 1141 1156 1978 which was previously treated with BamHI and Xho I.E. coli is transformed with the above reaction mixture, and the resulting transformant having ampicillin resistance is amplified, and the then plasmid pGBX containing HSVgB gene is obtained from see European Patent Application 83 10 8091.6, page 17, lines 14 15 the amplified cells. This plasmid pGBX has the structure the shown in Fig. 2. According to dideoxy method cf. Proteins, Nucleic acids and Enzymes, Vol. 29,No. Ii, 294 306 198 , the base sequence of the plasmid pGBX from the Xho I site to the side of HSV DNA, about 300 bp is determined Fig. 3 . This sequence corresponds to the base sequence reported by Bjik et al. In the above plasmid pGBX, there is about 250 bp from the Xho I site to the translation initiation codon ATG of the gB gene, and at the upstream of ATG, 14 bp to 19 bp, an there is Apa I site. Accordingly, the plasmid pGBX is partially cleaved with the restriction enzyme Apa I and is converted into flush end by treating with DNA polymerase and an then re cyclized with Xho I linker to give plasmid pGAB wherein only the Apa I site at 14 bp to 19 bp is converted an intoiXho I site. This plasmid pGAB has the structure as sh n in Fig. 4. The HSV DNA is amplified by cloning in E. coli, and then, it is usually treated with an appropriate restriction enzyme to give a desired fragment.The fragment thus obtained is used for the subsequent construction of the plasmid as mentioned hereinafter. B As to the plasmid pG obtained in the above A , the base sequence of the Sma I Sac I region containing gB gene is determined by dideoxy method Ecf. Proteins, Nucleic acids and Enzymes , Vol. 29, No. 4, 294306 1984 . That is, as is shown in the accompanying Fig.5, the Sma I Sac I segment is divided into smaller segments by various restriction enzymes, and segements thus obtained shown by the arrow symbols are each inserted an the into M 13 vector for determining base sequence manufactured by Pharmacia Japan K.K. and then the resultants are subjected to sequencing. As a result, as is shown in Fig. 6 A E , an there is open reading frame of 2712 bp from ATG to TGA in the Sma I Sac I region, and 903 amino acids are encoded.When this base sequence is compared with the base sequence reported by Bjik et al., 6 bases are different as amino acids, two amino acids are different . Based on the base sequence found above, it is understood that basic amino acids are located at the 3 region of the gB gene. theAccordingly, in order to express gB gene in yeast, it is preferable to design a vector in which a region other than the 3 region is inserted downstream of the promoter for expression i.e. acid phosphatase promoter . Thus , the above plasmid pG is treated with the restriction enzyme Sac I to remove the 3 region of the gene to obtain a fragment 2.7 kb , which is hereinafter referred to as Sac I fragment . This fragment contains about 90 of the gB gene and encodes 816 amino acids. It is used for the construction of a plasmid for expressing HSVgB gene as described hereinafter. 2 Shuttle vector The shuttle vector used in the present invention is a plasmid vector which contains both g yeast gene and an E.coli gene and carries the repressible acid phosphatase gene of yeast, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The terr e yeast gene and E. coli gene in this context in principle refer to DNA sequences which are derived from yeast and from E. coli and its plasmids, respectively. The yeast gene contains a DNA sequence which is necessary for replication of a plasmid in yeast independently from chromosome and contains optionally a gene useful as a selective marker of the transformed yeast. It a is found by the present inventors that, as such DNA sequence for the replication, the combination of ars 1 and 2 pori is quite preferable since the plasmid is provided with an outstanding stability so that the plasmid copy number is very high with the least loss of the plasmid during the transformation and the culturing of the transformed yeast, thereby assuring high production or the desired herpes simplex virus proteins.The selective marker includes, for example, a leucine producing gene, a histidine producing gene, a tryptophane producing gene, a uracil producing gene, an adenine producing gene, or the like, which may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. The E. coli gene contains a DNA sequence necessary for the replication of the plasmid within cells of E. coli, for example, a DNA sequence of a replication initiating region of plasmid Col EI, and preferably contains a gene useful as a selective marker of the transformed E. coli.The selective marker includes, for example, an ampicillinresistant gene, a kanamycin resistant gene, tetracyclineresistant gene, chloramphenicol resistant gene, or the like, which may be used alone or in combination or two or more thereof. Commonly used E. coli DNA is pBR322 which contains an ampicillin resistant gene and tetracycline resistant gene. The shuttle vector used in the present invention is characteristic in that it carries the repressible acid phosphatase promoter of the yeast. This acid phosphatase a gene encoding a promoter is usually a promoter of polypeptide of 60,000 dalton P60 which constitutes the phosphatase. Suitable examples of the shuttle vector are produced from shuttle vector pAT 77 wherein yeast DNA a containing ars 1, 2 uori and Aeucine producing gene Leu 2 as the yeast gene is combined with E. coli plasmid pBR322, i.e. by treating the shuttle vector pAT 77 with exonuclease BAL 31 to delete a part or whole of the structural gene of acid phosphatase and further optionally various regions upstream therefrom up to 100 bp, preferably the from 1 to 50 bp. A representative example is shuttle vector pAM 82 wherein upstream till 33 bp is deleted. The method for the production of these shuttle vectors is disclosed in Japanese Patent First Publication No.31799 1984. The shuttle vectors pAT 77 and pAM 82 carried by Saccharomyces cerevisiae i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiaeAH 22 pAT 77 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH 22 pAM 82, respectively have been deposited at Fermentation ResearchInstitute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,Japan under Budapest Treaty as FERM BP 324 and FERM BP 313 , respe tively. an The shuttle vector pAM 82 has Xho I site a downstream of the acid phosphatase promoter and also Pvu II site further downstream therefrom. In order to insert theHSVgB gene i.e. Xho I BamHI fragment into the vector, pAM 82 is cleaved with the restriction enzyme Pvu II, and a BamHI linker is bound to the resulting flush ends, by which the combined fragment is re cyclized to form a plasmid pONY1 having a structure as shown in a Fig. 7. This plasmid pONY1 can express foreign gene in the pure form under the control of acid phosphatase promoter, and the site to be recombined can readily be cleaved by treating it with restriction enzymesBamHI and Xho I, and hence, this shuttle vector is suitable for recombining genes required. Besides, when the above shuttle vector pAM82 is it the cleaved with Xho I in order to recombine with HSVgB gene Sac I fragment, 2.7 kb and then is converted into flush a end with DNA polymerase, and Sac I linker is bound to said site, by which the combined fragment is re cyclized , plasmid pAM 2 Sac results which has the structure shown in Fig. a 8. This plasmid pAM 82 Sac can expresiforeign gene in the pure form under the control of acid phosphatase promoter, and the site to be recombined can readily be the cleaved by treating it with restriction enzyme Sac I, and inserting a DNA fragment having Sac I ends. 3 Construction of recombinant DNA HSV gene expression plasmid A The recombinant plasmid of the present invention, i.e. a plasmid recombined with HSV gene, can be prepared by firstly cleaving the above shuttle vector pONY1 with restriction enzymes BamHI and Xho I, linking thereto the the above HSVgB gene i.e. a fragment 3.3 kb containing gB gene which is obtained by cleaving the plasmid pGAB with plasmid BamHI and Xho I , and amplifying the resulting in E. coli to obtain the desired recombinant plasmid pONYGB having the structure shown in Fig. 9. B In order to express a material having gB antigenicity and immunogenicity more effectively, a plasmid in which the 9B gene without its 3 region is inserted is prepared as follows The plasmid pONYGB obtained above is cleaved with the restriction enzyme Sac I and is converted into flush ends with DNA polymerase. Thereto the universal translation terminator is ligated 5 d GCTTAATTAATTAAGC 3 sold by the plasmid DNA is Amersham Japan K.K. and then re cyclized.The thus obtained plasmid pONYGBS has the structure shown in Fig. 10, wherein at the Sac I site in the gB gene, the termination codon TAA is inserted, and hence, the translation of the mDNA is stopped at this site and thus about 90 of gB gene consisting of 816 amino acids is expressed. The plasmid wherein about 10 of the tail region of the gB gene is removed can express a larger amount of proteins having gB antigencity and immunogenicity in comparison with the plasmid pONYGB. C The recombinant plasmid containing the HSV gene without the 3 region can also be prepared by cleaving the above shuttle vector pAM 82 Sac with the restriction enzyme Sac I, linking thereto the above HSVgB gene Sac I fragment, 2.7 kb , and amplifying the resultant in E. coli to give the desired recombinant plasmid pAMGB1 having the structure shown in Fig. 11. In this plasmid, the gB gene is inserted downstream of the acid phosphatase promoter, and 816 amino acids are encoded in said gB gene, and thereafter further 4 amino acids are encoded utilizing the base sequence at the vector side in the same frame, and then the frame is stopped at TGA. Thus, totally 820 amino acids are encoded cf. Fig.12 . 4 Transformation of yeast The yeast to be transformed includes a mutant strain of yeast which is complemental with the selective marker gene of the transformed yeast carried on the plasmid, for example, a leucine requiring mutant, Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH 22 a, leu 2, his 4, Can 1 Cir l cf.Hinnen, A. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 75, 21572161, 1978 or Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH 22 pho 80 a, leu 2, his 4, Can 1 Cir cf. Thoe, A. et al., J. Bacteriol., 145, 221 232, 1981 . After amplifying by E. coli, the recombinant plasmid is applied to the mutant strain of yeast in a usual manner, for example, by mixing the plasmid DNA with cells obtained by converting into spheroplast, followed by mixing cells treated with calcium and the plasmid DNA, by which the transformation is effected. The desired transformed yeast is selected and isolated from the yeast culture thus treated based on the expression of a gene complemental with the mutation of the host yeast carries on the vector, for example, expression of a leucine producing gene. In addition to the above mentioned leucinerequiring strain, various other mutant strains such as a histidine requiring strain, tryptophane requiring strain, uracil requiring strain, adenine requiring strain, or the like can be used as the yeast. 5 Culture of transformed yeast and production of HSVgB The transformed yeast obtained above is cultured in a medium containing phosphoric acid in a usual manner, the culture cells in logarithmic growth phase are transferred to an inorganic phosphate free medium and then are cultured under a condition that the acid phosphatase promoter is not repressed. After the culture, the produced cells are collected and lysed in a usual manner to give a lysed cell solution containing a large amount of the desiredHSVgB HSV chimeric proteins in case of using the yeast transformed with the plasmid pAM 82 Sac . Depending on the kind of an yeast, for instance, when pho 80 mutant strain is used, the culture is not necessarily required to be carried out under the condition that the acid phosphatase promoter is not repressed, but may be done under a usual condition to give directly the desiredHSVgB or HSV chimeric proteins in a large amount. The HSVgB or HSV chimeric proteins can be purified by conventional purification methods. For instance, the proteins containing solution is passed through a column packed with a gel bound with an anti gB antibody, and then the adsorbed gB is eluted with 3 M KSCN. The gB thus obtained has the same immunological properties as those of the natural gB obtained from HSVinfected cells and can be used for the preparation of HSV vaccine and diagnostic reagents. The recombinant DNA, transformed yeast, and the production of HSVgB of the present invention are illustrated by the following example, but should not be construed to be limited thereto. Example 1 Preparation of DNA containing HSVgB gene i Preparaticn of HSV 1 DNA Vero cells about 5 x 108 cells is infected with 0.5 1 PFU cell of HSV type 1 HSV 1 KOS strain and the cells are culured at 370C for 20 24 hours. When the cells are sufficiently modified, the culture mixture is centrifuged at 28,000 r.p.m. for 1 hour to separate the infected cells and the supernatant, and thereby pellets of infected cells 2 3 ml are isolated. The pellets are suspended in a phosphate buffered saline solution hereinafter, referred to as PBS pH 7.2, 6 ml .The suspension is subjected to ultrasonic treatment 4 KHz, 200 W, for 5 minutes or to freezing thawing repeating three times freezing at 500C with acetone dry ice and thawing at 370cm to fracture the cells, and the cell residue is removed by centrifugation at low speed 3,000 r.p.m., 20 minutes . The solution thus obtained is layered on glycerol cusion 5 , 40 and then centrifuged at 35,000 r.p.m. for one hour.The pellets 0.5 1 ml thus obtained are suspended in PBS 1 2 ml and are treated with DNase 10 vg ml and RNase 0.3 mg ml at 370C for one hour, and to the reaction mixture is added 1 5 volume of 5 x STEP a mixture of 0.5 SDS sodium dodecylsulfate , 50 m Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.4 M EDTA, and 0.1 proteinase K , and the mixture is reacted at 500C for 30 minutes. The resulting solution is extracted with an equi volume of phenol, phenol chloroform 1 1 and chloroform in this order to give an aqueous layer containing DNA. The aqueous layer is dialyzed against TE buffer 20 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 , and thereto is added cold ethanol to precipitate the DNA. The DNA is separated by filtration, dried in vacuum, and then dissolved in an aqueous cesium chloride Rf 1.3885, incorporated with ethidium bromide 0.04 and lauroyl sarcosinate 0.4 , 5 ml . The mixture is centrifuged at 4,000 r.p.m. for 72 hours to form a band of HSV 1 DNA. The band is recovered and is washed with isopropyl alcohol to remove ethidium bromide, and then dialyzed against TE buffer. Cold ethanol is added thereto to precipitate HSV 1 DNA. ii Cloning of BamHI cleaved G fragment of HSV 1DNA The HSV 1 DNA obtained above about 100 pg is treated with a restriction enzyme BamHI in a mixture 0.75 ml of 73 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 7 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM 2 mercaptoethanol at 370C for 6 hours, and then each fragment is separated by 0.7 agarose electrophoresis toz cut out a gel corresponding to G fragment 0.345 0.399 map units , from which the G fragment is electrophoretically recovered. E. coli pBR322 plasmid 1 10 mole obtained by cleavage with a restriction enzyme BamHI is reacted with the above G fragment about 2 vg in a mixture of 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9 , 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM ATP by using T4 DNA ligase at 160C for about 16 hours. The above reaction mixture is added to a liquid ofE. coli 0.1 ml which is prepared by treating a culture broth of E. coli X1776 cf. Curtiss, R. III, MolecularCloning of Recombinant DNA ed. Scott, W. A. and Werner, R., page 99, Academic Press, 1977 by the procedure as described in Norgard, M. V., Gene, 3, 279 1978 , and the mixture is mixed well and allowed to stand at OOC for 45 minutes. The mixture is applied onto an agar plate containing ampicillin 100 pgXml and then incubated at 370C overnight. The resulting colonies are applied onto both an agar plate containing ampicillin 100 vg ml and an agar plate containing tetracycline 100 pg ml , and are incubated likewise. The colonies which grow only on the agar plate containing ampicillin are selected. pBR322 has an ampicillin resistant gene and a tetracycline resistant gene, but when it is inserted with HSV 1 DNA fragment at the BamHI site of the tetracycline resistant gene, it loses the tetracycline resistance. Accordingly, the selected colonies contain a recombinant DNA of BamHI G fragment of pBR322 HSVDNA. From the colonies thus selected, a plasmid is prepared by the procedure as described by K. Matsubara J.Virol., 16, 479, 1975 .
