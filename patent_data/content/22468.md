# Continuous loop seat belt system with locking junction ring.

## Abstract
A load locking junction device is provided to couple a continuous loop belt 20 having ends mounted on the vehicle door with an anchor belt 32 retractably mounted at the inboard side of the occupant seating position. The junction ring 34 includes a stamped metal frame 40 having a central elongated aperture defining spaced apart first and second elongated load bearing walls 46, 48 . The continuous loop belt 20 is slidable over the first wall 46 to divide the continuous loop belt into a lap belt portion 38 and a shoulder belt portion 36 . The anchor belt 32 extends through the aperture and has a pin 50 engaged in the end thereof to enlarge the anchor belt end portion for simultaneous engagement against the second wall 48, 1 of the continuous loop belt so that the belts are coupled together and maintained in engagement with the load bearing walls against migration towards the ends of the elongated aperture.
