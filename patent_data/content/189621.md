# Rail borne apparatus for measuring and recording the parameters of the roadway track or of the carrier vehicle, the position of trolley wires and the roadway clearance, and for correcting the position of the track.

## Abstract
As well as monitoring line, cant and gauge of a roadway track, the apparatus is adapted to survey the position of a trolley wire by monitoring the displacements of a trolley pole structure biased into contact with the wire. Chart recorders can be switched over to record the pulses derived from the non driven running wheels of the carrier vehicle and proportional to the rate of movement along the track, which pulses normally control the drive of the recording chart, the chart now being moved at a constant speed. This provides for checking, e.g., stopping distances of the drive vehicles after braking. For monitoring clearance in the roadway, there is provided, in a housing 24 , a plurality of sonar pulse producing components arranged and adapted to reveal encroachments on the required free section. For correcting the position of the track, the vehicle is provided with rail gripping clamps, lateral lifting rams 40 and horizontal slewing rams 52 .

## Description
Apporotus for a Track Roadway This invention is concerned with improvements in or reloting to apparatus for use in association with a track roadway, and particularly apparatus for monitoring changes in at least one parameter of a track roadway and for correction of the position thereof. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for use in association with a track roadway, said apparatus comprising a structure supported on a track wheel arrangement, clamp means provided on the structure for clomping of the latter to a rail or rails of the track, ground engaging means mounted on the structure to be movable between a first position clear of the roadway for movement of the apparatus along the track, and a second position in engagement with the roadway whereby the apparatus, and thus selectively the rail or rails, can be raised relative to the ground engaging means, and means for moving the apparatus, and thus selectively the rail or rails, laterally relative to the ground engaging means, whereby to correct the position of the track. Preferably the ground engaging means comprises at least one ram positioned laterally outwardly of each side of the structure and disposed vertically. Preferably also the lateral moving means includes a horizontally disposed ram extending outwardly from each side of the structure and being connected with the respective ground engaging means. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for use in association with a track roadway, said apparatus comprising a structure supported on a track wheel arrangement, means operatively connected with the track wheel arrangement for generating a sequence of signals at a rate proportional to the rate of movement along a track, means mounted on the structure to extend upwardly therefrom and present a component for contact with a trolley wire in the track roadway, the component being movable about a plurality of axes relative to the structure, whereby the relative position of the component can vary in accordance with variations in height and lateral position of the trolley wire in the track roadway, and means for converting the relative movement of the component into information which is presented to receiving means therefor. Preferably the component comprises an elongate arrangement which provides a follower for engagement with a trolley wire, and the component presenting means comprises a support which pivotally mounts the elongate arrangement, the support being pivotally mounted on the structure. Preferably also, the elongate arrangement is pivotally mounted for movement in a vertical plane relative to the support, and the vertical displacement is monitored by means of a linear potentiometer extending between the elongate arrangement and the support. Desirably, the support is pivotal relative to the structure in a horizontal plane in accordance with the angle of displacement of the elongate arrangement, the angle of displacement of the elongate arrangement being monitored by means of an angular position sensor. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side elevation of an apparatus according to the invention Fig. 2 is an elevation from one end of the apparatus of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a perspective view from said one end Fig. 4 is a perspective view from the other end Fig. 5 is an elevation of part of the apparatus which is not shown in Figs. 1 to 4 and Fig. 6 is a plan view of the port of Fig. 5. In underground locations such as mines, the workfaces can extend considerable distances from the pit head location and it is often necessary to transport men or materials or both over such distances. The means of transport may comprise vehicles running on tracks laid in the excavated tunnels and it is important to continually monitor the conditions of the track and of the drive vehicles. Indeed this is required by the safety regulations. Referring to the drawings, a track vehicle 10 is provided as a self contained unit containing equipment for carrying out monitoring procedures. The vehicle 10 is arranged to be connected to a drive vehicle for movement along a track 14.The vehicle 10 has a cabin 16 mounted on a bogie 18 having track wheels 20 and a suspension allowing additional wheel movement to meet the requirements of the test facilities hereinafter described. Within the cabin 16 there is provided a unit housing three chart recorders 22. Normally it is desired that each chart is moved in proportion to the distance travelled by the vehicle 10 on the track 14 and to enable this a mechanical transmission system transmits drive from a wheel 20 of the vehicle 10 to a pulse generator not shown in the form of a shaft angle encoder. The pulse generator is formed of a spark resistant material so as to be intrinsically safe when used underground. The pulses emitted by the pulse generator are transmitted to a stepping motor within the chart recorder unit such that, for example, one inch of chart movement corresponds to 30 feet of distance travelled on the track 14. The mechanical transmission from the wheel 20 to the pulse generator comprises a first sprocket 32 associated with the wheel 20 and a first motion chain 34 driving a sprocket 36 from the sprocket 32. From the sprocket 36, a second motion chain 37 drives a shaft which powers the pulse generator. For the correct ratio the sprockets are designed to produce a predetermined pulse rote from the pulse generator. The mounting of the sprocket 36 compensates for movement of the wheel 20 and thus the sprocket 32. In a modification, means may be provided for transmitting electrical signals from the wheel 20 to the pulse generator to avoid the requirement for a mechanical transmission. To present information on the chart of each recorder 22, a pen unit for each chart is operatively connected with a transducer mounted on the vehicle to monitor different conditions of the track 14. The recorders 22 are preferably provided with a switching facility whereby the pulse generator controls the operation of the pen unit in any one of the recorders 22 as an alternative to the chart movement. in this event, an internal battery of the recorder 22 is utilised to drive the chart at a constant speed. With this arrangement, the varying pulse output resulting from a change in the track wheel speed provides a facility for checking, for example, stopping distances of the drive vehicles after braking. For monitoring the in line condition of the track 14, between each pair of wheels 20 at a respective side of the vehicle 10 there is provided a transducer operatively connected to a connecting rod extending between the wheels and controlling operation of the pen unit on one of the chart recorders 22.For monitoring lateral tilt, a transducer is operatively connected with an exle of the bogie 18 and controls operation of the pen unit on another of the chart recorders 22. For monitoring the track gauge, an electronic system utilises a pair of sprung trailing arms not shown each carrying a double flanged wheel, made for example of nylon, the wheel being free to move laterally against light spring pressure. The use of such arms and wheels improves the following of the track rails and enables all mechanical linkages to be mounted below the floor of the cabin. On each trailing arm there is provided a linear potentiometer which monitors the lateral position of the respective flanged wheel. An interface unit is incorporated to connect to the third of the chart recorders, the latter being fitted with an additional gain setting on the transducer amplifier.A unit is provided to calibrate the track gauge monitor.Chart display of track gauge is analogue and can be set such that the full width of the chart represents a gauge variation of 50mm 2mm chart lmm variation . The vehicle is also provided with a roadway clearance arrangement comprising nine sonar transducer heads not shown mounted within a housing 24 Fig. 3 at a front end of the vehicle 10, the housing 24 having an arcuate upper wall 26 in which is defined an aperture 28 aligned with each of the transducer heads. Each of the latter produces ultra sonic pulses and the operative area of each transducer head is such that overlap between adjacent heads ensures that pulses are transmitted over 1800 or more laterally of the track roadway. In this way the distance to the walls or roof of the roadway can be measured acoustically and a control unit for the transducer head is provided which is interfaced to one of the chart recorders 22. Preferably the display on the chart recorder is set such that a clear roadway is shown as a straight line at a nominal position on the chart. An incursion into the field of sensitivity of the sonar unit causes the pen of the chart recorder to deflect for the distance that an incursion is present. Pulse rate and speed of monitoring of the vehicle determine the minimum difference for which an intrusion must be present to be detected, it being anticipated that at 6 whodr an intrusion for 15mum will be detected. The system is not capable of measuring the depth of incursion into the roadway but the field of sensitivity around the vehicle is adjustable. In a further monitoring facility Figs. 5 and 6 a pair of trolley poles 70 are mounted on the roof of the vehicle 10 by means of a mounting 72 and present at one end a follower 74, preferably of a plastics material, for engagement with a trolley wire running along the track roadway. The trolley poles 70 mount a counterweight 76 at the other ends to lightly bias the follower 74 into contact with the wire and the poles 70 are pivotally mounted on a support 78 about a horizontal pivot 80 so as to be free to move in a vertical plane, the support 78 being mounted by means of a swivel 82 and swivel latch 84 on the mounting 72 to permit lateral or radial move ment.Any variations in the height and lateral position of the trolley wire can be monitored, vertical displacement being monitored via a linear potentiometer 86 extending between a connecting bar 87 on the poles 70 and the support 78, and angular displacement by means of an angular position sensor, wired such that identical readings can be made with the pole rotated through 1800. The variations in height and lateral position can be measured in a single run of the vehicle using two of the chart recorders. The counter eight 76 is calibrated by means of a scale 88 on the support 78, over which scale the poles 70 are movable, and vertical travel of the poles 70 is restrained between end positions defined by adjustable stops, each comprising a threaded bolt 90 in a threaded sleeve 92, the latter being at an outer end of a lug 94 extending from the support 78. It will be appreciated that a chart recorder can be provided for each monitoring facility but it is more desirable to use a smaller number of chart recorders which can be switched to co operate with selected ones of the monitoring facilities. An intrinsically safe electronic data logger can be used either as a replacement for, or in conjunction with, the existing chart recorders. The data logger improves both the collection of information and the subsequent interpretation of results. Multi channel capability enables efficient simultaneous recording, in one run, of all roadway parameters that can be monitored. Data is simply and easily recorded, in either cassette or RAM format for easy detailed interpretation. In addition to the data logger the use of a standard chart recorder gives on the spot results. Further, the vehicle is provided with apparatus enabling correction of the position of the track rails when a monitoring facility has detected a deviation. For this purpose, the vehicle 10 has a pair of hydraulic rams 40 positioned laterally outwardly of each side of the cabin 16, each ram 40 being disposed vertically and having a piston 42 extending downwardly from one end of a cylinder 44, the piston having a ground engaging foot 46.Each of the cylinders 44 is connected with a horizontal tube 48 of square configuration telescopically extending into the cabin 16 within an outer tube 50 to prevent movement of the ram 40 from the vertical orientation, the telescopic movement of the tube 48 which controls movement of the respective ram 40 laterally relative to the vehicle 10, being controlled by means of an outboard hydraulic ram 52 having one end connected to a lug 54 mounted on the casing of the ram cylinder 44. On the rear end of the cabin, to be accessible from outwardly thereof, there are arranged two sets 56 of hand levers, each set having four levers 58 in the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle 10 to control individually the lateral position of each ram 40 relative to the vehicle 10, and the extension of the piston 42 of each ram 40. In the uppermost position the piston 42 of each ram 40 is raised clear of the ground to enable travel of the vehicle along the track while extension of the piston 42 of a respective ram 40 will move the piston 42 into engagement with the ground and thereafter further extension will raise the vehicle 10 relative to the track roadway. At each end of the vehicle there is provided a clamp 60 for co operation with a respective one of the rails 61 of the track. Each clamp 60 is pivotally mounted on the vehicle 10 and has a pair of arms 62 mounted on a common pivot with a clamping collar 64 around the arms. In a non use position, the clamp 60 can be stared with the arms 62 extending upwardly clear of the track roadway, and for use the clrimp 60 is pivoted so as to extend downwardly from the vehicle, the collar 64 being moved upwardly on the arms 62 to enable separation of the free outer ends of the latter. The free ends of the arms 62 are then positioned against opposed sides of the respective rail 61 and the collar 64 is moved downwardly to a position preventing separation of the free ends of the arms 62, and therefore locking the clamp 60 to the rail 61. Accordingly when it is desired to correct the position of a rail 61 the vehicle is stopped and the operator then operates the hydraulic controls to selectively move one or more of the rams 40 laterally outwardly of the vehicle and into engagement with the ground. The rail which is to be corrected is then clamped to the vehicle 10 by means of one or more of the clamps 60, and thereafter further relative lateral or vertical movement of the rams 40 is transmitted into a corresponding movement of the vehicle 10 and thus the rail which is clamped thereto. The position of the rail is obviously changed in accordance with the fault which has previously been monitored. A hand operated pump 66 is provided for pressurising the hydraulic circuit. An auxiliary coupling is provided for connection of the hydraulic circuit to an external hydraulic supply if accessible, and a cover plate 68 is pivotally arranged on the end of the cabin 16 to cover the hand pump 66 and the auxiliary coupling when the latter are not in use. The provision of a self contained vehicle within which all the test facilities can be provided, and within which an operator can be comfortably located for continuous supervision, is extremely advantageous. The operation of the monitoring facilities is possible in whichever direction the vehicle 10 is being towed so that some tests can be carried out on movement in one direction along the mine roadway, and other tests can be carried out when travelling in the reverse direction, without requiring the vehicle to be turned around. Various other modifications may be made without departing from the invention.
