# NOTCHLESS ELECTRICAL RIBBON CABLE

## Abstract
A multi conductor insulated electrical ribbon cable 20 having webs 23 of insulation for spacing apart and joining the cable conductors 21 in a continuous, generally flat array. The webs are adapted with lengthwise grooves 24 positioned in close proximity to the conductors 21 , thereby facilitating severance of the webs in a manner which will allow the cable to be easily and reliably terminated to an insulation displacement connector without removal of the webs.
