# HEAT RESISTANT MEANS

## Abstract
The invention relates to heat resistant means such as an immersion tube for temperature measurement or sampling of a bath of molten metal. Immersion tubes are known to be made from conventional refractory materials, but are expensive. To reduce costs, it is known to employ cardboard tubes, but this invariably results in splashing of molten metal on immersion in the bath, and immersion time is very limited before the tube is burned away, with the possible loss of the sampler or the pyrometer fitted in the tube. The object of the invention is to avoid these disadvantages, which objective is met by a heat resistant means having a surface formed from or coated with an ablative or decomposible material, for example, an admixture of inorganic spheroidal powder, granular refractory material and or refractory fibrous material and an inorganic binder.
