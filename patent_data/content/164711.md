## Description
The invention relates to a method for detection and location of a fault point on a power transmission line according to the precharacterising part of claim 1. The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the method. Such a method and device are substantially known from the document Proceedings IEE 1966, Study of symmetrical and related components through the theory of linear vector spaces , pages 1057 to 1062. There are several different methods for fault location on a transmission line. One such method is known from the GB A 2 036 478, in which a method is described according to which a fault point is assumed and, while making simplified assumptions about the parameters of the network, the current and voltage of the fault point are determined. This determination is repeatedly performed until the current and the voltage have the same phase, which means that the fault point has been located. Another method is described in SE A 8205235 8 corresponding to US A 4 559 491. This US patent has been published after the priority date of the present application. This application describes a fault location on a section of a three phase power line. After measurement of currents and voltages at one end of the section, the type of fault is first determined and thereafter certain parameters in an equation system are determined. This system describes the relationships between the complex values of the impedance of the section, the source impedances at the remote end and at the near end of the network, as well as measured currents and voltages while eliminating the fault resistance, the pre fault current, the zero sequence components, etc. The solution of the equation system provides the distance from the end point of the section to the fault point in question. Certain aspects on the theory of a travelling wave have also been put to use earlier. SE PS 368,092 US A 3,878,460 describes the principle of a directional wave detector. By studying the signs of the current and voltage waves, it can be determined whether there is a fault in the monitoring direction of the relay protection device towards the fault point. If this is the case, the current and voltage waves have opposite signs. DE B 24 40 234 discloses a method which is based on known wave guide equations. According to this method there are formed a wave voltage, wave functions, weighting functions, integral functions, differences and products of these for obtaining product polynomials. One or more of these polynomials are then investigated with respect to their sign as a means to determine the direction to the fault from a given location on the line and or with respect to the absolute value of the polynomials as a means to determine the distance to the fault from said given location on the line. The document also mentions known matrices for model transformation between single phase and three phase currents and voltages. DE A 3 235 239 describes a method to determine direction and distance from a measuring point to a fault on a transmission line. In the measuring point, measured voltage and current values are digitized and three consecutive digital measuring values in each quarter of a period are stored with the current values being multiplied by the wave impedance prior to storing. Each set of stored values is used to produce travelling waves from the measuring point to the fault point and in the opposite direction. By linear combinations of the travelling wave signals including, as parameters, the wave impedance, the specific line inductance and the transient time of the travelling waves a fault indication signal is obtained the amount of which indicates the distance to the fault and the sign of which the direction to the fault. EP A 0 062 446 describes a method to obtain the position of a fault by measuring the time it takes for a transient to travel from the monitoring point to the fault and back again. The apparatus consists of generating means for extracting transient components, and output means for detecting elapsed time. The invention aims at developing a method for detection and location of a fault point on a power transmission line of the above mentioned kind which permits a rapid, accurate and reliable fault detection and a determination of the distance to the fault. The invention also aims at developing a device for a carrying out the method. In order to achieve this aim the invention suggests a method for detection and location of a fault point on a power transmission line according to the introductory part of claim 1, which is characterized by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1. Further developments of this method are characterized by the features of the additional claims 2 to 6. A device for carrying out the method is characterized by the features of claim 7. Further developments of this are characterized by the features of the additional claims 8 to 10. The invention is based on a model of the transmission line according to the travelling wave theory. At certain definite time intervals, a measurement of the instantaneous values of the currents and the voltages is carried out at the end point of the transmission line, for example at a station. Based on these measured values and with the aid of the travelling wave theory, and by employing the result of the technical development within the field of electronics and the microprocessor field, the invention offers a new solution concept within the relay protection technique, particularly for distance protection devices and fault location devices. The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying figures. In summary the invention can be described as follows The theory of travelling waves on transmission lines is described in several text books, inter alia in Elektricitetslära by E. Halle n, Uppsala, 1953. The so called telegrapher s equation , which is well known in this connection and the designation of which indicates that the equation was previously used primarily in fields other than power transmission, states that if In the practical application, which will be described here, it can be assumed that the transmission line is distortion free. This means that Further, it is commonly known that the wave velocity and that the wave impedance, with the aid of which the current wave can be expressed, is In the same way as the voltage at a point j on the transmission line, the current at the same point j can be expressed in accordance with equation 4 as In addition, the following general equations apply which enables the equation 4 to be expressed as When a wave moves along a line, an attenuation of the amplitude takes place. When the wave has moved from x O to x d Starting from the wave velocity according to equation 5 , the transit time for the wave from x O to x d The attenuation according to equation 12 and the transit time according to equation 13 permit u where u From equations 10 and 11 , u With the aid of the measured values of u Further, using equations 14 and 15 , the equation 4 can be written as To gain a deeper understanding of the presented theory and thus also of the principle of this invention, we can study Figures 1, 2 and 3. On examining the movement of a wave along a transmission line, a time table can be set up. According to equations 5 and 13 , the wave velocity is where, as mentioned, d In Figure 1 the movement for a plurality of waves has been drawn into a diagram with the distance of the transmission line along the horizontal axis and the time along the vertical axis. The inclination of the line is determined by the wave velocity v. Starting from time t O, a number of waves passing the measuring point d O in the positive direction have been studied. These are u₅ , u₄ , ... u Since the theory states that the voltage at a point j on the transmission line at a certain moment is the sum of the wave in the positive direction u Different intersectional points between the u waves and the u waves may be optionally studied. Figure 1 shows control voltages which are related to the same point of time. In Figure 2 it has been chosen to study control voltages related to a certain wave, u₅ , in the negative direction. Also other alternatives are possible. In Figure 1 the calculated voltages u ₁, u The equations stated above apply to single phase systems. Power lines normally consist of three or possibly more phases. It is well known that a symmetrical multi phase system can be divided into independent modes. In this way, by suitable transformation, a symmetrical three phase system can be divided into three single phase systems which are independent of each other. By applying the previously stated equations to the systems obtained by transformation, the travelling wave model can also be used for calculating the faults for multi phase systems. For fault analyses and for level sensing, it is often most suitable to use the phase voltages and the main voltages of the original multi phase system. Therefore, an inverse transformation of the modal control voltages back to the original multi phase system takes place. Transformations of these kinds are known from a number of publications of various kinds, for example Proceedings IEE 113 1966 6 June Study of symmetrical and related components through the theory of linear vector spaces . Since the utilization of such transformations is included as an integrated part of the method and the device to which this invention relates, a brief summary of the transformation methodology will be described. Figure 4 shows an arbitrary network with connection terminals R, S and T and a ground connection. If a voltage U At the same time, as indicated in Figure 4, the voltage U Now, if the voltage U Now, if it is assumed that the currents I By introducing the above mentioned impedances, the equation system describing the network can be written as or in reduced form The equation system according to the above can, of course, be solved in conventional manner. In the same way as in other technical fields the calculations can be simplified by transformation of equation systems, for example, by Laplace transformation, from a time plane to a frequency plane, also in this case currents and voltages can be transformed so that, on certain conditions, simpler calculations and increased clarity can be achieved. The transformation of the equation system 25 to modal or independent form implies that we are seeking an equation system Let it first be assumed that I or in reduced form The same method can be applied to the voltages U or Equation systems 30 and 32 must have a solution. With matrix designations this means that there must be an inverse matrix K Now, using equations 31 and 33 in equations 27 , the result will be On condition that M is given in the form of a diagonal matrix, that is, a matrix of the form the equation system 39 can be written as With knowledge of Z Starting from a symmetrical three phase system, it can be shown that The matrices which are used in this connection are the so called Clarke s matrices which, if our earlier matrix designations are maintained, are constituted by In a symmetrical three phase network, equation systems 26 can be written as Equation 38 can also be written as With L Now, in order for then it is presupposed that Now, looking at a network according to Figure 5, it can be seen that Since U With knowledge of U It is the phase quantities that are most suitable to study. Single phase faults are indicated by using U The protection device for carrying out the method according to the invention can be built up in analog or digital technique. Examples of embodiments in analog technique are shown in Figures 6 and 7. In an embodiment according to Figure 6, transformation of incoming phase voltages U Figure 7 is an embodiment showing the same units L1, K1, K2, FL, TR and FR as in Figure 6. In the shift registers S3 and S4 the transformed values of U Figure 8 illustrates a more detailed block diagram corresponding to Figure 7. Transformation of incoming phase voltages U The modal voltage values are each supplied to a respective shift register S3a, S3b and S3c, and the modal current values are multiplied by the respective modal impedances, whereafter the voltage values are obtained and then supplied to shift registers S4a, S4b and S4c. If it is assumed that control voltages at n points along the transmission line are to be calculated, the shift register has to be able to store 2n measured values in each mode, corresponding to measurements at times t τ The calculation part A3 The calculated voltages U If the control voltages at two consecutive points j and k, that is, u In order quickly to obtain a fault indication, the values of the voltages u ₁, u₀ and u If the fault location logic has determined that two consecutive control points j and k are respectively situated on either side of a fault, the value of the control voltages u This is an interpolation method, and for greater accuracy other interpolation methods may be used. If the source impedance is smaller than the line impedance, the current at the measuring point will be greater in case of a near end line fault than in case of a busbar fault which is behind the measuring point. The result is that the calculated voltage u The voltage can be approximated to Thus, the value of voltage u In the foregoing, only the methods for the fault location logic have been described. Devices for carrying out the method can be constructed in many different ways which, however, with the knowledge displayed above are trivial and known per se and therefore not described in this specification. This distance measuring relay protection device, which has been described above, can be supplemented with a directional wave detector.
