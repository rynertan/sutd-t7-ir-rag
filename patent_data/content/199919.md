# Optical flow sensor.

## Abstract
An optical flow sensor for optically detecting and measuring the flow of a fluid through a drip chamber assembly 27 . The sensor comprises an optical energy emitting chip 29 sealed within a first lens block 19 having a refracting lens 21 in one surface and an optical energy detecting chip 47 sealed within a second lens block 23 having a refracting lens 25 in one surface. The two lens blocks 19, 23 are positioned on the two parallel arms pf a U shaped base with their lens surfaces facing each other across the open space between the arms of the U . The drip chamber assembly 27 has transparent walls defining a drip chamber 55 , and the lenses 21,25 compensate for the refractive effects of the walls of the drip chamber assembly 27 on the optical energy passing through. As drops of fluid fall through the chamber 55 , they intersect the optical energy passing through the chamber 55 and produce a corresponding output signal from the detector.
