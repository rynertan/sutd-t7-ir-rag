# Directed beam fusion reaction with ion spin alignment.

## Abstract
In a fusion reaction where ions from two sources 16, 17 are formed by passage through magnetic fields H to travel helically towards each other in opposite senses of rotation and directions at a common radius in an annular reaction zone 29 defined by two coaxial spaced apart electrodes 32, 35 , a low velocity beam of gaseous ions from each source is established. The spins of the ions are aligned while at said low velocity to produce polarized ion beams. The ions in the polarized ion beams are accelerated to fusion velocities for injection into the reaction zone. Magnetic field are applied to cause opposite directional travel of the ions in the polarized ion beams. A D.C. radially directed electrostatic field is established between the coaxial electrodes for confining the beams to helical paths and compressing the ion beams. The D.C. electrostatic field is applied as the confining field in the annular reaction zone 29 . Each of the two oppositely directed polarized ion beams are injected into the reaction zone wherein collisions occur.
