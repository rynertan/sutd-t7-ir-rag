## Description
Semi Coaxial Dielectric Filter 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a filter used in a frequency range from VHF band to relatively low frequency microwave band.2. Description of the Prior Art Conventionally, this kind of filter is constructed as disclosed in the Japanese Laid open Patent ApplicationNo. 58 9401. The structure is shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, which show a dielectric 101, through holes 102, an outer conductor of conductive film 103 disposed on the side of the dielectric 101, inner conductors of conductive film 104 surrounding the through holes 102, end surfaces 105 and 106 short circuiting conductor of conductive film 107 provided on the end surface 106, coupling capacitors 108a and 108b, input and output terminals 109a and 109b, and a cavity 110. The end surface 105 is open. Therefore, two 1 4 wavelength resonant units are composed by the inner conductor 104, outer conductor 103, short circuiting conductor 107, and intervening dielectric 101.These two resonant units are coupled together via the cavity 110, and the coupling coefficient is determined by the shape of the cavity 110. The input and output terminals 109a and 109b are electrically connected to the inner conductor 104 at the open end plane 105 via the coupling capacitors 108a and 108b, respectively, thereby making up a filter as a whole. In such conventional construction, however, since the cavity is needed for coupling, the space occupied by the cavity is an obstacle for reducing the size of the filter.Since the dielectric to compose the filter is integral, it is impossible to evaluate each of the resonant units. If filters having different performances were required, different dielectric blocks having different shapes corresponding to such requirements must be prepared, which reduces productivity.Since the cavity for coupling is exposed outside the filter, the filter will be easily affected by the environmental conditions.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is hence a primary object of this invention to provide a semi coaxial dielectric filter that is small in size but is excellent in mass producibility at low cost. It is another object of this invention to provide a semi coaxial dielectric filter that is stable, or less susceptible to effects of the environment outside the filter. These objects can be achieved by a filter comprising at least two independent resonators coupled to each other via coupling windows. Each of the resonators comprises a tubular dielectric having at least one flat side surface and a through hole in the axial direction, an inner conductive film provided on the wall formlng the through hole, and an outer conductive film provided on side surfaces of the tubular dielectric, thereby to resonate in TEM mode in the axial direction due to cooperation of the inner and outer conductive films and the dielectric intervening therebetween.Each of the resonators is further provided at the flat side surface with at least one coupling window at which the conductive film is removed. The resonators are connected to contact at the flat side surfaces so that the coupling windows oppose to each other, thereby to construct the filter in which the resonators are coupled with each other via electromagnetic field through the coupling windows. With this structure, the size of the filter becomes small because the size is merely the sum of the sizes of the resonators. The performances of the resonators can be evaluated independently to each other. Since the coupling coefficient can be changed by merely changing the shape or the position of the coupling window, filters having a variety of performances can be easily obtained at a low cost, resulting in high productivity. Since the electromagnetic field contributing to the filter operation is substantially distributed within the dielectric, the filter is hardly affected by the environment outside the filter.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGs 1 and 2 are side sectional and perspective views of a conventional filters FIGs. 3 and 4 are side sectional and perspective views of a resonator, a construction element of a filter of this invention FIGs. 5 and 6 are side sectional and perspective views of an embodiment of the filter of this invention, which is a two stage band pass filter FIG. 7 is a side sectional view showing an example of three stage band pass filter as another embodiment of this invention FIG. 8 shows an example of coupling window FIG. 9 is a graph showing the coupling coefficient when the coupling window in the shape shown in FIG. 8 is used FIG. 10 shows another example coupling window FIG. 11 is a graph showing the coupling coefficient when the coupling window in the shape shown in FIG. 10 is used and FIGs.12 to 14 are a side sectional view and top views showing an example of resonator having a variable resonance frequency mechanism usable in the filter of this invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGs. 3 and 4 are a side sectional view and a perspective view of a semi coaxial dielectric resonator as a construction element of a semi coaxial dielectric filter of this invention.This resonator comprises a dielectric 1 of parallelepiped shape, a cylindrical through hole 2, a coupling surface 3 having a coupling window 6, an inner conductor 4 of conductive film provided on the wall forming the through hole 2, an outer conductor 5 of conductive film provided on a side surfaces 7, end surfaces 8 and 9, and a short circuiting conductor 10 of conductive film provided on the end surface 9. The dielectric 1 has the through hole 2 extending in the axial direction, and its one end surface 8 is open while the other end surface 9 is provided with the shortcircuiting conductor 10 for short circuiting, or electrically connecting the inner conductor 4 and the outer conductor 5. The resonator shown in FIGs. 3 and 4 is a 1 4 wavelength resonator of TEM mode being composed of the inner conductor 4, the outer conductor 5, the short circuiting conductor 10, and the intervening dielectric 1. The length Q in the axial direction of the resonator is expressed as t at 4 , Ag xof Ao wavelength in free space dielectric constant As is well known, in the 1 4 wavelength resonator, the electric field is intense at the part closer to the open end 8 and the magnetic field id intense at the part closer to the short circuiting end 9 in the dielectric 1. The conductive film is very thin, being about tens of micrometers. FIGs. 5 and 6 show a semi coaxial dielectric filter constructed by two 1 4 wavelength semi coaxial dielectric resonators shown in FIGs. 3 and 4. The two resonators 13i and 130 are disposed so that their coupling surfaces 3 having coupling windows 6 contact each other, with the respective outer conductors 5 being electrically connected and mechanically fixed to each other with a solder or a conductive adhesive 14. In this arrangement, the resonators 13i and 130 are coupled with each other via electromagnetic field through the respective coupling windows 6. Supposing the coupling efficiency by electric field coupling to be ke and that by magnetic field coupling to be km, the total coupling efficiency k is expressed as follows k ikm kei As explained above, when the coupling window 6 is disposed closer to the open end surface 8, the total coupling efficiency k is dominated by ke, but on the other hand when it is disposed closer to the short circuiting end surface 9, km becomes dominant. Input and output terminals 12i and 120 are electrically connected at the open end surfaces 8 to the inner conductors 4 of the resonators 13i and 130 through coupling capacitors lli and llo, respectively, thereby constructing the two stage filter.Each of the capacitors lii and llo may be either a lumped. constant or semi lumped constant capacitor. The capacitance of the coupling capacitor is expressed as follows EMI7.1 The resonator length is shorter than the 1 4 wavelength due to the effects of the coupling capacity and the resistances of the terminations at the end of the filter, and expressed as follows l 1 4 XolJi . fo fo where ... oo Znfo fo center frequency of the filter b Cr b Lr 1 b susceptance slope parameter of of ofthe resonatorEMI7.2 EMI7.3 R resistance of the terminations at the ends of the filter K impedance inverter at the ends of the filterFIG. 7 shows an embodiment of filter in which three resonators are used. As shown in the figure, in the case of a filter having three or more stages, the inner resonator 13m has two coupling surfaces 3a and 3b which respectively have coupling windows 6a and 6b. Through the respective coupling windows 6a and 6b, the inner resonator is coupled with the resonators 13i and 130 at both sides thereof via electromagnetic field.The capacitance of each of the input and output coupling capacitors lii and llo and the resonator length of each of the input and output side resonators 13i and 130 are determined by the formulas applied to the embodiment in FIGs. 5 and 6. The resonator length t of the inner resonator 13m is Q Xg 4. FIG. 8 shows an example of the shape of the coupling window 6. This coupling window 6 is rectangular disposed closer to the short circuiting end surface 9, and its one side is on the short circuiting end surface 9. FIG. 9 shows changes in the coupling coefficient k when the width W1 and the length L1 of the coupling window 6 in FIG. 8 are varied, under condition of r 36, Q 13 mm, w width of the resonator 10 mm, and a diameter of the throughhole 3 mm. If L1 t 0.5, then km ke, thus k e km FIG. 10 shows another example of the shape of the coupling window 6.The coupling window 6 is rectangular one side of which is parallel to the end surface 9, and is isolated on the coupling surface 3. FIG. 11 shows changes in the coupling coefficient k when the length H and the average distance L2 from the end surface 9 of the coupling window 6 in FIG. 10 are varied, under condition of r e 36, t 13 mm, w 10 mm, a 3 mm, and W2 width of the window 6 5 mm. Considering the results shown in FIGs. 8 to 11, the coupling coefficient k of 0.007 to 0.020 can be achieved by the shape in FIG. 8, and k of 0.015 to 0.035, in FIG. 10.That is, even by mainly using the magnetic field coupling by disposing the coupling window 6 closer to the shortcircuiting end surface 9, a sufficient coupling coefficient for composing a filter can be obtained. This is effective to prevent the coupling coefficient from being affected by the environment outside the filter. FIGs.12 to 14 show a resonator having a resonance frequency variable mechanism. FIGs. 12 and 13 are a side sectional view and a top view of the resonator, and FIG. 14 is a top view when a dielectric rotor 15 and a shaft 19 are disconnected from the resonator. The inner conductor 4 is electrically connected with the inner conductor open end electrode 17 provided on the open end surface 8.The rotor 15 installed closely to the open end surface 8 has a semi disk shaped rotor electrode 16 on its upper surface which is not opposed to the open end surface 8.An inner part of this rotor electrode 16. is extended to the lower surface of the rotor 15 so as to be in contact with and thus electrically connected with the inner conductor open end electrode 17. On the other hand, an outer conductor open end electrode 18 provided on a part of the open end surface 8 is electrically connected with the outer conductor 5. Therefore, the rotor electrode 16, the outer conductor open end electrode 18 and the dielectric rotor 15 placed therebetween construct a variable capacitor. The rotor 15 is fixed to a shaft 19 which is rotatably inserted into the through hole. When the rotor 15 is rotated by rotating the shaft 19, the area of the rotor electrode 16 overlapping the outer conductor open end electrode 18 changes, so that the capacitance of the variable capacitor is varied, which permits fine adjustment of the resonance frequency. When a filter is constructed by using the resonators equipped with this resonance frequency variable mechanism, the filter can be easily adjusted.
