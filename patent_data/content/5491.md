# Process for the preparation of low temperature silicon nitride films by photochemical vapor deposition.

## Abstract
Low temperature photonitride LTPN films of excellent quality have been prepared at temperatures ranging from 300 C downward to 100 C by a photochemical vapor deposition process, wherein a mixture of silane, ammonia, and hydrazine is caused to react to form Si₃N₄ films at the substrate interface. These films are suitable for the preparation of silicon nitride passivation layers on solid state devices, such as metaloxide semiconductors MOS and charge coupled devices to impart enhanced reliability.
