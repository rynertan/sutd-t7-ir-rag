## Description
Developments in recombinant DNA technology have enabled the cloning in bacteria of the natural coding sequence of a variety of genes. See Seeburg, P. H., Shine, J., Martial, J. A., Baxter, J. D. and Goodman, H. M., In an attempt to maximize expression of foreign genes in yeast, their 5 promoter region, translation start and signal peptide sequences were replaced with similar regions from the yeast genome. With bovine growth hormone, these regions were replaced with those from the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase It has now been discovered that promoters for the In the articles of St. John and Davis The promoter region of the It is an object of the present invention to provide genetic recombinant material carrying a Another object of the present invention is to provide a DNA segment containing a It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of expressing bovine growth hormone, interferon, prorennin, pre prorennin or other polypeptides in a yeast cell by use of a It is an additional object of the present invention to provide modified strains of A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing products such as bovine growth hormone, interferon, prorennin, and pre prorennin in yeast through recombinant DNA techniques employing a According to the present invention, the expression of a gene for a desired polypeptide product is controlled by a A DNA segment is provided which contains a In a method for obtaining expression of a desired polypeptide product in yeast, a yeast Synthesis of a polypeptide product using a Microorganisms prepared by the genetic engineering processes described herein are exemplified by cultures now on deposit with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland. These cultures were deposited by Collaborative Research, Inc. and are identified as follows As more fully described below, a particular DNA segment is linked to a gene foreign to the yeast genome and incorporated in a modified strain of Generally, in preparing the plasmid for joining with the exogenous gene, a wide variety of techniques can be used, including the formation of or introduction of cohesive termini. Blunt ends can be joined. Alternatively, the plasmid and gene may be cleaved in such a manner that the two chains are cleaved at different sites to leave extensions at each end which serve as cohesive termini. Cohesive termini may also be introduced by removing nucleic acids from the opposite ends of the two chains or alternatively, introducing nucleic acids at opposite ends of the two chains. Methods which may be employed in joining cleaved DNA segments depend on the nature of the termini, as described below. Blunt ended refers to DNA molecules with duplex base paired termini. See Sgaramella, V., van de Sande, J. H., and Khorana, H. G., Blunt ended DNA s are produced as for example, by cleavage with any of a number of restriction endonucleases, such as Cohesive ended refers to DNA molecules with single stranded termini. The single stranded extensions are complementary and antiparallel. See Mertz, J. E., and Davis, R. W., Joining of base paired duplexes occurs when the nucleoside at a 5 end carries a phosphate group and the complementary nucleoside opposite to it carries a free 3 hydroxyl group. Two phosphodiester bonds would be made essentially simultaneously and the joined duplexes would have their nucleotide sequence inverted with respect to one another. There are three general approaches to creating cohesive ends on DNA These methods are well known, as exemplified in the following articles Sadler, J. R., Betz, J. L., Teiklenburg, M., Goeddel, D. V., Yansura, D. G., and Caruthers, M. H., Linker refers to a duplex, blunt ended DNA molecule from 6 14 base pairs in length, containing the recognition site for a restriction endonuclease that produces cohesive termini. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the plasmid serves as the vehicle for introduction of the foreign gene into the yeast cell. However, it is not necessary to use a plasmid, since any molecule capable of replication in yeast can be employed. The DNA molecule can be attached to a vector other than a plasmid, which can be a virus or cosmid as known in the art or it can be integrated into the chromosome. The recombinant plasmid or plasmid chimera is constructed The transformation of the bacterial cells will result in a mixture of bacterial cells, the dominant proportion of which will not be transformed. Of the fraction of cells which are transformed, some significant proportion, but in some cases a minor proportion, will have been transformed by recombinant plasmid. In any event, only a very small fraction of the total number of cells which are present will have the desired phenotypic characteristics. In order to isolate only the bacteria containing the DNA chimera or the original plasmid, a selectable genetic marker is included on the original plasmid, such as resistance to an antibiotic or heavy metal. The cells can then be grown on an agar medium containing the growth inhibiting substance. Since Cells from various clones may be harvested and the plasmid DNA isolated from these transformants. The plasmid DNA may then be analyzed in a variety of ways. One way is to treat the plasmid with an appropriate restriction enzyme and analyze the resulting fragments for the presence of the foreign gene. Other techniques have been indicated above. Once the recombinant plasmid has been replicated in The term The bovine growth hormone gene referred to, which can be promoted by the promoter used in this invention, is a protein of about 22,000 daltons synthesized in anterior pituitaries. The hormone is required for pre adult growth. Bovine growth hormone BGH contains a single polypeptide of 191 amino acids with two disulfide bridges synthesized initially as a pre growth hormone containing an amino terminal extension of 26 amino acid residues. See Miller, W. L., Martial, J. A. and Baxter, J. D., The interferon gene referred to, which can be promoted by the promoter used in this invention, is any one of the three classes of interferon genes described below Preferably in the methods of this invention pre prorennin and prorennin can each be obtained by isolation of pre prorennin DNA material. The pre prorennin is a precursor of prorennin. By removing portions of the pre prorennin DNA, one could obtain genetic material which will code for prorennin. Pre prorennin or prorennin genes in accordance with this invention comprise any nucleotide sequences coding for the amino acid sequence of pre prorennin or prorennin respectively and exclude any intervening nucleotide sequences present in the genomic DNA encoding pre prorennin or prorennin respectively. These genes are also provided attached to vectors which replicate in suitable host cells. For the purposes of this application, the prorennin gene is defined as any sequence of nucleotides which codes for the prorennin molecule, the amino acid sequence of which is described in the literature B. Foltmann, V.B.Pedersen, H.Jacobsen, D.Kauffman, and G.Wybrandt, The pre prorennin gene includes the sequence of nucleotides coding for prorennin, but also includes 48 additional nucleotides on the 5 end which code for the amino terminal precursor polypeptide found on the pre prorennin enzyme. The yeast strain employed as the host cell in the preferred embodiment of the present invention is The vast majority of yeasts can be cultivated under relatively uniform conditions on common laboratory media. The usual growth requirements of yeast include Such growth requirements are met by yeast nitrogen base YNB, obtained from Difco , a chemically defined medium which contains a number of trace elements, 9 vitamins, trace amounts of amino acids to stimulate growth of certain fastidious yeasts and the principal minerals, potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, and calcium chloride. The nitrogen source is ammonium sulfate. The desired carbon source must be added and is normally at a concentration of 0.5 3 . Additions are made to this medium to fit particular strain requirements. The pH range of the medium is usually from pH 3 8. The preferred range is pH 4.5 6.5. The starting point for obtaining the cells of the present invention is the use of recombinant DNA techniques known in the art to obtain the genetic material desired and to insert it into the host cell after which the host cell is cloned. Preferably, the gene which one wishes to ultimately clone in yeast is isolated in a first step by obtaining messenger RNA of the gene from a primary source. In the case of BGH, this is obtained by isolation from the bovine pituitaries. The messenger RNA can be isolated as by the method of Deeley, et al. R.G. Deeley, J.I.Gordon, A.T.H. Burns, K.P. Mullinix, M.Bina Stein, R.F. Goldberger The messenger RNA is then converted to double stranded DNA by conventional means. First, the complimentary copy of the DNA is made from the messenger RNA by conventional recombinant DNA means as by the use of AMV reverse transcriptase. For example, the methods of A. Efstratiadis, F.C. Kafatos, A.M. Maxam and T. Maniatis, Next, enzymes such as Thirdly, synthetic linkers can be attached to both ends of the double stranded DNA as for example by the use of In a fourth step, the DNA molecule is integrated into the chromosome or attached to a vector which can be a plasmid, virus or cosmid as known in the art. Such vectors include This step is again carried out outside of the final host cell. Useful techniques for this procedure are described in the references above in connection with the linkers as well as in the following publications V. Hershfield, H.W. Boyer, C. Yanofsky, M.A. Lovett P.R. Helinski, In a fifth step, the recombinant DNA molecule can be introduced into the cytoplasm of the host cell line using conventional procedures such as described in M. Mandel A. Higa 1970 Recognition of the correct clone may be accomplished by the method of hybridization selection or by probing with synthetic oligonucleotides, T. Taniguchi, Y. Fujii, Kuriyama and M. Muramatsu, The newly modified host cell is then cloned and expression of the material desired obtained. For example, the technique of Guarente, et al. using the lactose operon promoter, 1980 L. Guarente, G. Lauer, T.M. Roberts M. Ptashne, In the present invention, the arrangement of the DNA segments in the plasmid construction is shown diagramatically in Table 4. This construction consists of several components generally used in shuttle vectors, i.e., plasmids that can be maintained either in Segment 4 is a 0.755 or 0.82 kb fragment of DNA from the yeast genome which contains signals for transcription of the Segment 5 is a fragment of DNA which encodes for the desired polypeptide product sequence. This piece of DNA is oriented so that transcription of the mRNA is controlled by a The plasmid was constructed by ligation of DNA pieces from various sources and synthetic linkers. The sequence at the junction of the 0.82 kb The sequence at the junction of the 0.755 kb The plasmid was first cloned and amplified in Permissible modifications in the production of a polypeptide product in yeast would include The yeast strain described herein will produce the desired polypeptide product if the medium contains galactose. The medium should contain 6.7 g l yeast nitrogen base, 2 galactose and the appropriate amino acids. If the polypeptide product proves to be deleterious to the host strain, the production can be repressed by growing the yeast in a medium containing 2 glucose, 6.7 g l yeast nitrogen base and then inducing the production of the polypeptide product after growth has ceased by transferring the yeast to the galactose medium.
