## Description
DIAZABICYCLO 2,2,2 OCTADIONES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION The invention relates to a group of new compounds of the type of diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octadione and to a process for the preparation of such compounds. Dutch Patent Application 6400946 laid open to public inspection describes 2, 5 diazabicyclo 2 ,2,2 octadiones as starting products for the preparation of the corresponding octanes. These diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octanes in the N substituted and unsubstituted forms find application as antihistamines, antiemetics, antiallergics, tranquillizers, antiparasitics, hypotensive agents, central nervous system depressants, sedatives, antibiotics, spasmolytics, analgesics, and in some cases as central nervous system stimulants and the like. The invention provides a new group of compounds which are characterized by Formula I of the formula sheet, in which R1 to R6 may be the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group. The compounds are substituted or unsubstituted 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3,5 diones. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention R1 is an ethyl or methyl group. According to another preferred embodiment of the inventionR2 is an ethyl or methyl group. Specific examples of compounds in accordance with the invention are l methyl 2 , 6 diazabicyclo 2 ,2 ,2 octa 3 ,5 dione, 1,2,6 trimethyl 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3,5 dione, 1,4 dimethyl 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3,5 dione, l ethyl 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3,5 dione and 1,8 dimethyl 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3,5 dione. These compounds can be used as starting products for the preparation of the corresponding octanes. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of a 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3,5 dione according to Formula I. This process is characterized in that a compound withFormula II of the formula sheet, in which R and R represent an alkyl group or H and R1 R6 have the same meaning as in Formula I, is reacted with ammonia or a primary amine R2 NH2, in which formula R2 has the same meaning as in Formula I. It is preferable to use an excess of the NH3 or primary amine in relation to the compound of Formula II. The stoichiometric quantity of NH3 or the primary amine is 2 moles per mole of the end product. It is of course possible to use a deficient quantity of the NH3 or primary amine, but this is less advantageous. The maximum quantity of the NH3 or primary amine is essentially determined by the economy of the process. The reaction with ammonia gives no substituents in positions 2 and 6, whilst the reaction with a primary amine gives an N substituted compound. An example of a starting compound is ethyl 2 carbethoxy 5 oxocaproate. Upon reaction with ammonia this compound gives l methyl 2, 6 diazabicyclo 2, 2, 2 octa 3, 5 dione with liberation of ethanol. In view of the nature of the reaction, R and R should preferably be lower alkyl groups, such as methyl or ethyl. The reaction may be carried out in accordance with known methods for the preparation of amides J. March, Advanced OrganicChemistry Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, McGraw Hill Book Co.,New York, 1968, pp. 338 339 . The process may be carried out in a solvent inert with respect to the reaction product. However, the solvent may also be the primary amine that is to take part in the reaction. It has been discovered that it is advantageous to use a solvent in which the starting compound is readily soluble and the reaction product is insoluble or only sparingly soluble, so that the reaction product is precipitated during the reaction. Examples of such solvents are water and lower alkanols C1 4 such as methanol, ethanol, and propan l ol. It is generally unnecessary to add a catalyst to the reaction mixture. Under certain circumstances it may be advantageous to work at an elevated temperature and or an elevated pressure to improve the reaction rate and or the yield. After termination of the reaction the product is separated from the reaction mixture, for example by distilling the solvent off or by filtering the solids off. The solids can then be washed and dried. If necessary, the diazabicyclooctadione obtained may be recrystallized one or more times. If the starting compound is an ester of Formula II, the alkanol formed in the reaction may be recovered and recycled. The compound of Formula II may be prepared by any of the known methods for such compounds, for example by the reaction of an , unsaturated ketocompound Formula III with malonic acid, a malonic ester, or a derivative of these compounds Formula IV . In this way the reaction of butenone with diethyl malonate gives the above mentioned ethyl 2 carbethoxy 5 oxocaproate. The invention will now be further explained by means of individual examples. If a decomposition temperature is given in an example it means that the compound decomposed before reaching the melting point.Example I Preparation of l methyl 2, 6 diazabicyclo 2,2, 2 octa 3,5 dione 230 g of ethyl 2 carbethoxy 5 oxocaproate and 270 ml of 25 wt aqueous ammonia were mixed at room temperature in a round bottom flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser. The temperature rose slowly to 340C as the ester dissolved.Solids started to crystallize out after about 1 h. About 5 h after the start of the reaction the temperature began to fall. By about 16 h after the start of the reaction the temperature had fallen to 2O0C at this stage the solids were filtered off and washed with water. After drying, 106 g of a compound that was subsequently identified as l methyl 2, 6 diazabicyclo 2, 2, 2 octa 3, 5 dione was obtained. The yield was thus 68.8 . The compound decomposed at 2500C. Identification of l methyl 2,6 diazabicyclo 2 ,2 ,2 octa 3 ,5 dione a. Mass spectrometry The mass spectrum of the compound was recorded with AEI instruments MS9 and MS30. The mass spectrum showed a weak peak at m e 154. The empirical formula of the strong fragment of mass 126 was CsH6N202 calculated from an accurate mass measurement at a resolving power of about 15000. This means that C2H4 had split off, which indicates the presence of a C2 bridge. b. NMR spectrometry The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the compound were determined with an XL 100A. Varian spectrometer at room temperature, using deuterated formic acid as solvent and TMS as reference. The results were as follows 1H NMR 6 1.73 s, 3, CH3 6 2.10 m, 4, CH2 6 3.60 t, 1, CH 6 11.16 s, 2, NH 3C NMR 6 19.37 Cg 1JCH 28.5 Hz 6 19.9 C8, 1JCH 31.5 Hz 6 33.05 C7, 1JCH 30.0 Hz 6 50.0 C4, 1JCH 34 Hz 6 68.4 C1, 1JCH O Hz 6 175.1 C3, Cg 1JCH O Hz Comparison of these spectra with those of the starting compounds showed that the product was l methyl 2,6 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octa 3, 5 dione.
