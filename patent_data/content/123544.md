# PROCESS FOR EXPRESSING HETEROLOGOUS PROTEIN IN YEAST, EXPRESSION VEHICLES AND YEAST ORGANISMS THEREFOR

## Abstract
The isolation of the yeast Î± factor genes is described. The promoter and signal peptide portions are isolated and joined to DNA coding for proteins heterologous to yeast in a plasmid which is used to transform yeast cells. The yeast expresses the heterologous DNA and processes and secretes the heterologous protein.
