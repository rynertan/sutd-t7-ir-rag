# CURABLE COMPOSITIONS FOR PRODUCING POLYURETHANE FOAMS

## Abstract
A composition curable by reaction with an organic polyisocyanate to a polymer foam in which the predominant recurring polymer unit is isocyanurate, comprises a halogen ated organic blowing agent a polyester polyol mixture and a polyether polyol having an average hydroxyl functionality of at least 4 comprising the adduct of at least 4 moles of a C₂ C₆ alkylene oxide and an organic compound having at least 4 functional groups reactive with said alkylene oxide. The polyester polyl mixture is prepared by a transesterification, with a glycol of molecular weight from 60 to 400, of a residue remaining after dimethyl terephthalate and methyl p toluate have been removed from the product of oxidation of p xylene in the preparation of dimethyl terephthalate or b esterification, with an alkylene oxide selected from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, and mix tures thereof, of a carboxyl functional residue resulting from the removal of terephthalic acid from the mixture obtained by the oxidation of p xylene in the preparation of terephtha lic acid.
