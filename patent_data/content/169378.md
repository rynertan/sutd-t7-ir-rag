# Hydrofining process for hydrocarbon containing feed streams.

## Abstract
At least one decomposable compound selected from the group consisting of compounds of the metals of Group IVB of the Periodic Table is mixed with a hydrocarbon containing feed stream. The hydrocarbon containing feed stream con taining such decomposable compound is then contacted in a hydrofining process with a catalyst composition comprising a support selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica and silica alumina and a promoter comprising at least one metal selected from Group VIB, Group VIIB and Group VIII of the Periodic Table. The introduction of the decompos able compound may be commenced when the catalyst is new, partially deactivated or spent with a beneficial result occuring in each case.
