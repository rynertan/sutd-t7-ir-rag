# AMORPHOUS MATERIAL WHICH OPERATES MAGNETICALLY.

## Abstract
In order to highly efficiently perform magnetic opera tions such as magnetic refrigeration and cooling over a wide temperature range, use is made of an amorphous alloy as a magnetically operating material, which has a relatively great magnetic moment and which has some of the charac teristics of spun glass. Examples of amorphous alloys in clude those containing rare earth metals, or those which occlude hydrogen, and combinations of one or two or more amorphous alloys in which elements are contained in the Fe group to render the alloy amorphous. The composition is so adjusted as to have a desired transition point from a high temperature to a low temperature, or so that the magnetic transition point changes continuously. After a weak or in tense external magnetic field has been applied, the alloy is adiabatically de magnetized so as to operate magnetically. The alloy can be adapted to a broad range of applications from very large plants such as MHD power generation, nuclear fusion, and energy storage as well as linear motors and computer peripheral equipment.
