# System for packaging ice cream cones and like articles.

## Abstract
A system for packaging into cartons cones for ice cream and other cornet like articles coming loosely from a produc tion unit effects in a first processing station A a splitting of the cone feed main stream into a plurality of individual sub streams. In a second processing station B a temporary cone storage field is made up, the cones being orderly marshalled in a number of rows, the cone axes being vertical with the cone tips upside down, the cones being closely spaced apart from each other. From said second processing station B the cone rows are transferred into a third processing station C , wherein, for each cone row, a belt 50 having evenly spaced apart bores 51 for receiving indi vidual cones. Each belt is independently motorized for stepwise forward motion. As a predetermined number of bores in each belt carries as many cones as there are bores, a cone grasping unit E draws the cone row and transfers it into empty cartons. If so desired, the cones can be deposited in the cartons alternatingly by the cone grasping unit E with their tips upside down, and with their tips up by the agency of a tipping device.
