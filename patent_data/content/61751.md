# Filament type photoflash lamp, process for fabricating the same, and primer material.

## Abstract
A filamentary type photoflash lamp suitable for use with a relatively low voltage high current power source includes a glass envelope 3 with a shredded metal fill 5 , a pair of leads 7, 9 interconnected by a filament wire 11 and a primer 13 having percussively ignitable and powdered combustible incandescible material on the leads with the primer material responsive to heat generated by the filament wire. A process for fabricating the above described photo flash lamp is also provided as well as a primer material composition.
