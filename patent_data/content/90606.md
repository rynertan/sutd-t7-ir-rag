# CONTINUOUS COATER SOLVENT RECOVERY PROCESS

## Abstract
A process for the recovery of solvent entrained in a water vapour laden exhaust gas stream exhausted from a spray paint ing system is disclosed. The process includes an oil absorption unit which absorbs and removes all but about 100 parts per mil lion of the solvent from the exhaust gas stream while permit ting air and water vapour to be vented from the system and a stripper which in turn removes all but about 0.001 mole frac tion of any one solvent component trapped in the oil. The oil, which is substantially free of solvent, is returned to the absorp tion unit. The stripped solvent can then be condensed and re used by mixing it with the paint solids to be sprayed in the pro cess or, alternatively, it can be admitted as a vapour into the atmosphere surrounding a work piece which is being coated in the spray painting system to raise the solvent humidity sur rounding the workpiece to above about 70 . By raising the solvent humidity to above about 70 caking of paint on the in terior surfaces of the spray booth, plugging of the paint spray nozzles, and rapid evaporation of solvent from the paint is reduced. The present process provides a means to recover and reuse even a complex mixture of solvents where the recovered solvent comprises a mixture of the same components in the same ratio as the solvent mixture originally used in the paint spray system. The system is described in relation to a con tinuous coater wherein parts to be coated move continuously through an enclosed paint spray area and are coated while the solvent laden atmosphere therein is exhausted from the coater for recovery of the solvent.
