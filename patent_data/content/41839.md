# Ultrathin solid membrane composed of silicon containing copolymer, process for producing said membrane and use thereof for concentrating a gas.

## Abstract
A film forming silicon containing copolymer consists substantially of recurring units derived from a silicon containing allyl monomer and an ethylenically unsaturated monomer and or a diene unsaturated monomer. An ultrathin solid membrane composed substantially of the silicon containing copolymer and a process for preparing the ultrathin solid membrane from the silicon containing polymer. The ultrathin membrane is useful for obtaining a specified gas such as oxygen in the concentrated state from a mixture of two or more gases such as air.
