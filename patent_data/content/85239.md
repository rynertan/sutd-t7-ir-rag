# Rotary balancer.

## Abstract
A rotary balancer for unbalanced mechanisms such as internal combustion engines comprises an Oldham coupling device 44 with a central coupler 48 that orbits in a curved usually circular path at a frequency twice the speed of the coupling rotation. The balancer acts as a substitute for an equivalent rotating eccentric weight when driven at only one half of the rotational speed, thus causing reduced bearing friction and noise. Such a balancer may be used in pairs or other multiples in a similar manner to eccentric weights to offset various unbalance conditions.
