# Housing for an arterial blood filter with improved gas venting.

## Abstract
A novel liquid filter of the outside in type is disclosed, comprising a hollow tubular housing, a concentrically disposed perforated tubular core surrounded by a cylindrical filter element and communicating with a liquid outlet in the bottom wall of the housing, and a filter element cap covering the upper ends of the perforated core and filter element. A gas vent is located at the highest point in the top wall of the housing, which is at the center of the top wall. The liquid inlet and filter element cap are designed to provide for establishment of a stable swirling flow outside the filter element and above the filter element cap. An improved means of bonding upper and lower cup like portions together to form a hollow tubular housing with high resistance to rupture under pressure is claimed. The filter of the invention is particularly suited for use in extracorporeal blood flow circuits, most particularly as an arterial blood filter located downstream from a blood oxygenator.
