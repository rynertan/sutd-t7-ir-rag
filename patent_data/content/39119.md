# Process for recovering yttrium and lanthanides from wet process phosphoric acid.

## Abstract
Yttrium and lanthanides are recovered from wet process phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is treated with a flocculant by which a precipitate is formed. This latter is separated out and yttrium and lanthanides are recovered from the precipitate. 75 by wt. or more of the yttrium and lanthanides present can be recovered in a very simple manner.
