# Radiation image read out method and radiation image recording and read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image read out method comprises the steps of detecting the amount of light instantaneously emitted by a specific region 90 of a stimulable phosphor sheet 2 when the stimulable phosphor sheet is exposed to a radiation 91 passing through an object 1 to have a radiation image of the object stored therein, and adjusting read out conditions and or image processing conditions on the basis of the detected light amount. The stimulable phosphor sheets are circulated through an image recording section, a read out section, and an erasing section by conveyor belts and reused for image recording.
