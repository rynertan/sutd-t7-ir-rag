# Improvements in self energising disc brakes.

## Abstract
A self energising disc brake of the spreading type incorporates a drag taking stop abutment 40, 41 for arrest ing angular movement of one of the pressure plates 5, 6 when the brake is applied. The stop abutment comprises a cam 46 which is mounted on the inner end of a cam shaft 43 , and the cam shaft is rotatable in a radial bore 44 in the housing 4 to adjust the relative circumferential position of the stop abutment.
