# 16 METHYLENE AND SULFINYL STEROIDS AND THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
16 Methylene 17 keto steroids are transformed to the corresponding 16 methylene 17α hydroxyprogesterones which are intermediates useful in the production of be tamethasone, diflorasone diacetate and melengesterol ace tate. 17α Hydroxy 6, 16 dimethylene pregn 4 ene 3, 20 dione is simultaneously isomerized and acylated to 17α hydroxy 6 methyl 16 methylenepregna 4, 6 diene 3, 20 dione 17 acetate.
