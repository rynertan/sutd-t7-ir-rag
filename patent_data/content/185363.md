# AUTOMATIC COMPENSATOR FOR COMPENSATING COLLIMATION ERROR DUE TO TWO DIRECTIONAL INCLINATION IN SURVEYING INSTRUMENTS

## Abstract
An optical plummet mechanism for compensating an error due to an inclination of a surveying instrument comprises a first pendulum 2 suspended in the instrument body interior, a second pendulum 4 suspended in a perpendicular relation to the first pendulum 2 , a first reflector 3 provided on the first pendulum 2 for reflecting light incident in the direction of a collimation axis 10 of a collimation lens 13 in the direction of a substantially horizontal collimation axis 11 lying in the plane of swinging of the first pendulum 2 , and a second reflector 5 provided on the second pendulum 4 and being a double reflecting surface reflector for reflecting light incident in the direction of a collimation axis 11 lying in the plane of swinging of the first pendulum in the direction of a vertical collimation axis 12 . Collimation errors due to inclination of the instrument body 1 in two directions, i.e., back and forth direction and left to right direction, can be simultaneously automatically compensated for by the pendulum actions of the first and second pendulums 2, 4 in perpendicular directions.
