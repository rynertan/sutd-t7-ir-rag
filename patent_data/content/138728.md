# ELECTROGRAPHIC SYSTEM

## Abstract
An electrographic system utilizing a transparent resis tive layer which operates in conjunction with a stylus or cross hair cursor excited from an a.c. source to develop coordinate defining electrical signals. Through the utilization of a sequence of border switching arrays, the signals may be collected from the resistive surface in a predetermined sequence and submitted in serial fashion to the input of a signal treatment network. As a consequence, only one such network is required to effect operation of the system. The hand held cursor is formed including a transparent disk carrying cross hairs which is excited from an a.c. source to very accurately locate coordinate positions upon the resis tive surface.
