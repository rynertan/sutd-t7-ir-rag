# Block copolymers of olefins with vinyl aromatic monomers.

## Abstract
Block copolymers of ethylene and or alpha olefins, in particular propylene, with vinyl aromatic monomers, com prising at least two polymeric blocks, one of which is a polyolefinic block and the other of which has a stereoregular structure formed by vinyl aromatic monomer units.
