# RECOMBINANT DNA EXPRESSION VECTORS AND METHOD FOR GENE EXPRESSION

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for preparing selectable and autonomously replicating recombinant DNA expression vectors which comprise 1 a transcriptional and translational activating sequence which is in the reading frame of a nucleotide sequence that codes for a peptide or polypeptide 2 a translational stop signal 3 a translational start signal which is in the reading frame of a nucleotide sequence that codes for a functional polypeptide and 4 an additional translational stop signal. The above described nucleotide sequences are engineered to generate, upon transcription, a translatable polycistronic mRNA. The inven tion further provides a method of use.
