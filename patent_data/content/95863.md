# Improvements relating to toning.

## Abstract
A method of applying liquid toner to a predetermined part 4, 5 of an electrophotographic film 1 is disclosed. The film is supported at a predetermined distance from an electrode 25 , having a toner supply orifice 7 . A predetermined quantity of liquid toner 13 is delivered, preferably by a metering cylinder 10 and piston 19 disposed between two valves 9, 11 , to the orifice 7 . The quantity is such that surface tension forces retain the liquid toner in the desired region 24 . A method of processing an electrostatic image is also disclosed, as well as an assembly for applying liquid toner. The latter is preferably electrode 25 positioned in a recess in a support surface 3 for the film 1 to be processed.
