# LANTERN WITH ADJUSTABLE REFLECTOR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
Two tubular, parallel light sources 11a, 11b cooperate with concave fixed reflectors 21a, 21b and concave ad justable reflectors 23a, 23b . When the adjustable reflectors are positioned alongside the fixed reflectors, the direct 27 and reflected rays 29 are concentrated within a directional beam. When the adjustable reflectors 23a, 23b are pivoted round by a common adjusting mechanism, so that they are in front of the fixed reflectors 21a, 21b the rays from the two sources 11a, 11b are distributed over the whole 360 degrees circle. The adjusting mechanism can position the adjustable reflectors selectively within a range of positions giving beam coverages in the range between say 180 degrees and 360 degrees.
