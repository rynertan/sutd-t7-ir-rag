# Metal oxide having uniform pore sizes, the process for producing said metal oxide, and catalyst carrier comprising the said metal oxide.

## Abstract
The metal oxides having a very narrow pore size distribution of micropores within the range of between 10 and 100 Angstroms can be prepared by reacting a water soluble basic salt of metal hydrate with an organic compound such as an acid halide in a specific manner. The pore diameter of the metal oxide can be arbitrarily controlled within the range of micropore size by changing the molecular chain length of an organic compound, treating with an acid or calcinating at different temperature. It is desirable that the narrow pore size distribution is centered within the range of 1 SIMILAR 30 Angstroms, preferably 1 SIMILAR 15 Angstroms when the metal oxide is used as a catalyst carrier.
