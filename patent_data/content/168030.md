# Contact type image sensor and driving method therefor.

## Abstract
A contact type image sensor comprising M x N of photodetectors arranged in line and M driving integrated circuits each of which includes a CCD shift register having N stages connected through one transfer gate to the corres ponding one of the photodetectors. Each of the driving circuits also has an output amplifier connected to the associated CCD shift register and a switch connected be tween the output amplifier and a common output line. When all the transfer gates are simultaneously turned on, a photoelectric charge stored in each photodetector is transfer red to the corresponding stages of the CCD shift register, and then sequentially read out from the respective CCD shift register by supplying transfer clock pulses to a selected CCD shift register while turning on the switch associated to the selected CCD shift register.
