# System for deploying an array of sonar projectors.

## Abstract
A system for deploying an array of sonar projector transducers includes a housing 10 in which a plurality of disk shaped projectors 36, 46, 48, 52 are stacked, a pair of small diameter cables 38, 40 are reeled from a powered drum 24 for tethering the projectors, the cables 38, 40 being anchored to the bottom projector 36 , a pair of electri cal conductors are connected to the projectors 36, 46, 48, 52 , each conductor constituting a series of sections 45 interconnecting electrical connectors fastened to opposite sides of each projector 36, 46, 48, 52 , a centering ring 28 attached to the bottom projector 36 including a series of pressure responsive latches 30 which service to secure the array in the housing 10 and to release the array upon its reaching a desired depth. Where the drum 24 is ac tuated the stack is lowered with each projector 36, 46, 48, 52 being successively suspended by its pair of conductor sections 45 , and each of the conductor sections 45 is given a predetermined twist such that when the array is again returned to the housing 10 the conductor sections 45 are caused to form predetermined loops.
