# A digital circuit performing an arithmetic operation with an overflow.

## Abstract
Input data from a source 11 such as a multiplier is added or subtracted by an arithmetic unit 12 , the result being placed in a result register 13 whose contents form one input to the arithmetic unit. A multiplexer 16 selects as the other input either the data from the source 11 or the contents of the result register and a shifter 15 is interposed between the multiplexer and the arithmetic unit. When the arithmetic unit 12 signals an overflow to a control circuit 17 the multiplexer 16 selects the result register 13 whose contents are shifted one bit by the shifter 15 . A shift control register 14 is incremented. Input data from the source 11 is initially not shifted but, after one or more overflows have occurred, such data is shifted by the number of bits corresponding to the number of times that the shift control register 14 has been incremented. This arrangement simpli fies both the hardware and the software cycles necessary to handle overflow.
