# Substituted quaterphenylene polyamides.

## Abstract
Polyamides comprising recurring units The polyamides exhibit solubility in select e.g. non amide type solvents and have high electron density sub stantially cylindrically distributed about their long axis. The molecularly oriented polymers are optically uniaxial and are useful e.g. in optical filter devices.
