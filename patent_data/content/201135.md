## Description
The invention relates to a combined soil cultivating machine for sowing fine seed, such as grass seed, in a top layer of the soil, as defined in the preamble of claim 1 Machines of this kind as known from GB.A.1568621 are usually not suitable for sowing very fine seed, such as grass seed. The construction according to the invention provides a soil cultivating machine of the above defined kind, which machine is perfectly suitable for sowing fine seed such as grass seed. According to the invention, this is accomplished by the characterising features of claim 1. When using this construction, the risk that the fine seed is dispersed too much is slight, and the seed can be effectively brought into contact with the upper layer of the cultivated soil, such that the required germination conditions for the seed are satisfied to a maximum extent. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which The apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 is an agricultural machine, more specifically a soil cultivating machine for preparing a seed bed. The machine comprises a box like frame portion 1 extending transversely of the intended direction of operative travel A and extending at least substantially horizontal. In the box like frame portion 1, the upwardly extending, preferably vertically extending, shafts 2 of soil working members 3 are supported at relative equal distances of preferably 25 centimeters. Each of the soil working members 3 includes a carrier 4 which extends at least substantially horizontally and is mounted on the lower end of a shaft 2, which end projects from the frame portion 1. At its ends, the carrier 4 accommodates a bushing 5, whose longitudinal centre line extends at least substantially parallel with the rotary axis of a soil working member 3. A fastening portion 6 of a tine 7A is disposed in each of the bushings 5. The ends of the box like frame portion 1 are closed by upwardly directed plates 55, which are located at least substantially parallel to the direction of operative travel A. Near the leading side, each plate 55 has, above the upper side of the box like frame portion 1, a pin 56 which extends transversely of the direction of operative travel A and above which one end of an arm 57 is freely rotatable. Behind the box like frame portion, the arm 57 merges into a support 58 for a roller 34 which support extends downwardly and rearwardly. The upper side of each support 58 is provided with strips 60 Figure 2 which extend at a rearward and upward angle and accommodate a hopper 26 of a grass seed drill 27. Discharge members 61 are provided, which comprise a vertically downwardly extending portion 62 which ends before the roller 34 at the level of the bottom side of the tubular part 35 of this roller. The portions 62 of the discharge members 61 are supported by a common support 63 which, by means of arms 64, is mounted at the front of the support 58. A transmission 41 49 is provided for driving the discharge mechanism of the seed drill 27. The arms 57 are adjustable in height with the aid of a known adjusting means 57A and consequently also the roller 34 for setting the working depth of the tines 7A. The roller 34 is provided with a tandem system of two rollers 34, these rollers being so arranged relative to each other that the combs 36 on one roller move between the combs 36 on the other roller. Driving of the discharge mechanism of the seed drill 27 is effected in this embodiment from a sprocket 65 on a shaft 33 of the foremost roller 34 Furthermore, the combs of the last roller effect scraping of the earth of the first roller. Clogging can be easily obviated by means of the rounded tips of the scraper elements 40. The mode of operation of the machine is as follows The machine described in the foregoing is particularly suitable for preparing a seed bed and subsequent sowing of grass seed. To that end, such a working depth can be set with the aid of the roller 34 that the tines 7A cultivate a 3 5 centimeters thick layer of soil. During travel of the machine in the direction of the arrow A, fertilizer is fed in front of the soil workin members, whereas the grass seed is discharged near the bottom side of the roller 34 into the rearwardly displaced earth. Discharging the grass seed from a low position may result in a reduced spread, so that op tionally a greater density of the spread pattern can be obtained, whilst, in addition, the risk of the grass seed being dispersed by the wind is reduced. The seed drill 27 can be adjusted in height together with the roller 34.
