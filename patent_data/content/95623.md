## Abstract
In a raster scanned television system a high degree of correlation exists both in the luminance L and in the chro minance signals H, S of a pair of adjacent lines 1₁, 1₂, etc. . Because of this correlation, the difference between the lumi nance signals L of the two lines 1₁, 1₂, etc. is much smaller than luminance signal L of either line 1₁, 1₂, etc. alone, it has less bandwidth. A luminance carrier is am plitude modulated by the average value of two adjacent lines 1₁, 1₂, etc. , while the phase of the carrier is modulated by the difference of two adjacent lines 1₁ 1₂, 1₃ 1₄, etc. . The bandwidth of the resulting signal is comparable to that of a carrier that is amplitude modulated by a single raster line 1₁, 1₂, etc. . Since two lines 1₁, 1₂, 1₃, etc. of information are being transmitted, however, it would be possible to take twice as much time to transmit them as when only a single line 1₁, 1₂, 1₃, etc. is being transmitted. Stretching the time axis in this way results in about a factor of about two reduc tion in bandwidth. A simple average of chrominance signal H, S is used for both hue H and saturation S . A chromi nance carrier is amplitude modulated by the average value of two adjacent hue lines 1₁, 1₂, 1₃, etc. , while the phase of the carrier is modulated by the average of two adjacent color saturation lines 1₁, 1₂, 1₃, etc. . After synchronous demodulation of the carriers, inverse operations are utilized to reconstitute the luminance L and chrominance signals H, S .
