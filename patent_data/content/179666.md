# Process for starting up the polymerisation of ethylene or copolymerisation of ethylene and at least one other alpha olefin in the gas phase in the presence of a catalyst based on chromium oxide.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for starting up the polymerisation of ethylene or copolymerisation of ethylene and at least one other alpha olefin by bringing ethylene and optionally at least one other alpha olefin in contact under fluidised bed polymerisation or copolymerisa tion conditions and or stirred mechanically, with a charge powder in the presence of a catalyst comprising a chromium oxide compound associated with a granular support and activated by thermal treatment, this catalyst being used in the form of a prepolymer, this process being characterised in that the charge powder employed is previously subjected to a treatment by contacting the said charge powder with an organo aluminium compound, in such a way that the polymerisation or copolymerisation starts up immediately after the contacting of the ethylene and optionally one other alpha olefin with the charge powder in the presence of the prepolymer.
