## Description
P cyanobiphenylyl p X alkoxyalkyl benzoate compound and liquid crystal material The present invention relates to a p cyanobiphenylyl p w alkoxyalkyl benzoate compound and a liquid crystal material. Liquid crystal display elements utilizing the electro optic effects of liquid crystals are widely used in display devices for displaying characters, numerals and images in watches, electronic calculators and television sets. The electro optic effect of liquid crystals include, e.g., dynamic scattering DS effect, twisted nematic TN effect, the guest host G H effect and the electrically controlled birefringence homeotropic DAP effect. These electro optic effects are utilized in various display devices in accordance with their applications. As a liquid crystal element utilizing the TN effect or G H effect, an optical shutter is known in which transmission and shielding of light through a liquid crystal composition is controlled by an electric field. Methods of electrically driving such a liquid crystal element include the static drive method and the dynamic drive method. An AC voltage is used as the drive voltage of liquid crystals. The two frequency drive method is known as a voltage application method for electrically controlling a liquid crystal utilizing the dielectric scattering phenomenon of liquid crystals. In this method, when a low frequency voltage is applied, the liquid crystal molecular axis is aligned in the direction of an electric field. When a high frequency voltage is applied, the liquid crystal molecular axis is aligned in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the electric field. In a liquid crystal used in any type of liquid crystal element, predetermined characteristics such as operating temperature, response time, drive voltage or viscosity must be satisfied in accordance with an application of the element, type of electro optic effect utilized, drive method, waveform of the application voltage and the like. Since a single liquid crystal compound cannot satisfy such various types of characteristics, a liquid crystal material used in a liquid crystal element is usually provided by a liquid crystal mixture containing a plurality of liquid crystals each having different characteristics. Such a liquid crystal material, as a whole, satisfies required characteristics of an intended element by the complementary effects of the characteristics of the respective constituent liquid crystal compounds. In order to widen an operating temperature range and to exhibit a liquid crystal state even at high temperatures, a liquid crystal mixture normally contains a liquid crystal compound which has a high nematicisotropic transition point N I point . However, conventional liquid crystal compounds of this type which have high dielectric anisotropy As have high viscosity or poor miscibility with other liquid crystal compounds in addition to having a relatively narrow temperature range in which they exhibit a liquid crystal state.Other conventional liquid crystal compounds which have low viscosity have small dielectric anisotropy. Thus, a liquid crystal compound having a high dielectric anisotropy, an excellent miscibility with other liquid crystal compounds and a capacity for not rendering the overall composition highly viscous upon admixture with other liquid crystal compounds, has not previously been available. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a compound useful as a liquid crystal having a high N I point, a high dielectric anisotropy, an excellent miscibility with other liquid crystal compounds low crystal nematic transition point C N point , and a capacity for not rendering the overall composition highly viscous upon admixture with other liquid crystal compounds. It is another object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal material which contains such a liquid crystal compound, has a wide operating temperature range and a low viscosity, and is suitable for driving by low voltages. In order to achieve the above objects of the present invention, there is provided a p cyanobiphenylyl p w alkoxyalkyl 3 benzoate compound represented by general formula I below EMI3.1 wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and n is an integer of 1 to 3 . There is also provided, according to the present invention, a liquid crystal material comprising at least one compound represented by general formula I .

When the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group, repre sented by R, exceeds 9, the resultant compound tends to exhibit the smectic phase, tends not to exhibit the nematic phase, has a high viscosity and has low compatibility with other liquid crystals. This is inconvenient for practical application. Preferably, R is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. More preferably, R is an alkyl group methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group or butyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
