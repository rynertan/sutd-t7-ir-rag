# Process for producing and recovering elemental sulfur from acid gas 1111111 .

## Abstract
A system and process produce high actual levels of sulfur recovery from acid gas. The system includes two conventional Claus reactors 116,133 and two cold bed adsorption CBA 153,165 reactors. Four condensers 109,125,145,160 are provided, one disposed before each of the catalytic reactors, and one disposed after the CBA reactor. The system includes a gas clean up treatment zone for hydrogenation, drying and oxidation of gas to provide stoichiometric ratio of H₂S and SO₂. The gas is passed through the clean up treatment zone prior to being fed to the first of the CBA reactors. The system is designed to operate either in a recovery mode or in a regeneration mode. In the recovery mode, the reactors are in series and the CBA reactors are operated below dew point of sulfur. In regenera tion mode, effluent from the clean up treatment zone is heated in a heat exchanger using effluent from the first catalytic reactor as the heat source. The resulting regenera tion gas is fed to one of the two CBA reactors to vaporize sulfur and regenerate the catalyst sulfur is recovered in the condenser. The effluent from the condensor is passed to the other CBA reactor which is operated in the recovery mode during regeneration.
