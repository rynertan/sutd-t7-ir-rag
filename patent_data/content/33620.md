# Catalytic production of octahydrophenanthrene enriched solvent.

## Abstract
The OHP content of an OHP and THP containing solvent is enriched by contacting the solvent with hydrogen in the presence of a supported catalyst 68 comprising Group VIB and Group VIII metals under conditions to increase the OHP THP ratio in the solvent to a level greater than 0.4 and preferably greater than 1. The preferred catalyst contains tungsten where it is desired to provide an OHP THP ratio greater than 1 in the OHP enriched solvent, and also contains titanium to improve the hydrogen selectivity of the catalyst so as to enhance the preservation of aromatics in the hydrogenated solvent. The OHP enriched solvent provides increased solvation of coal and improved yields of liquid fuel product in a coal liquefaction process which utilizes the solvent.
