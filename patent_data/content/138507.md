# Pyrotechnic tensioner for vehicle safety belt.

## Abstract
Apparatus for tensioning a strap 48 of a vehicle safety belt system, comprises a cylindrical drum 10 , a first roller 56 journaled on a stationary axis 54 parallel to that of the drum 10 and spaced radially outwardly from the surface thereof, a second roller 34 mounted with its axis parallel to the axis of the drum 10 at a radius between that of the surface of the drum 10 and the first roller 56 , and pyrotechnically powered means 30 for causing angular movement of the second roller 34 about the axis of the drum. Guide means 50 are located at a greater radial distance from the axis of the drum 10 than the second roller 34 and oriented so that, prior to detonation of the pyrotechnic charge, the angular position of the second roller 34 about the axis of the drum 10 is between the first roller 56 and the additional guide means 50 . The strap 48 passes between the second roller 34 and the surface of the drum 10 but radially outwardly of the first roller 56 . Prior to detonation of the pyrotechnic charge, the strap 48 does not touch the surface of the drum 10 . When the charge is deto nated, the second roller 34 draws in the strap 48 , wrapping it round the surface of the drum 10 .
