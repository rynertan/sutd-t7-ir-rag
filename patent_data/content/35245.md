# Improvements in or relating to methods of and or apparatus for flanging tube ends.

## Abstract
A machine has pivotal inner 22 and outer 30 form ing tools which flange one end of a thin metal tube 21 specifically to form a rotatable drum for laundry machines. The tools are actuated by hydraulic rams and the rams are actuated at different rates of movement under the control of a computer so that as forming is effected by moving both sets of tools from dispositions on a cylinder to dispo sitions on a disc the inner forming tools 22 have their pivot points 24 changed relative to pivot points 31 of the outer forming tools 30 resulting in relative sliding be tween inner and outer forming tools. The flange formed has two sets of ribs one set extending outwardly away from the tube 21 and the other set extending inwardly within the tube 21 and parts of the flange between adjacent ribs lying in a plane substantially at right angles to the wall of the tube 21 .
