## Abstract
In a charge coupled device, a DC bias on its signal register 12 input is automatically corrected for thermal fluctuations and other environmental effects.

The first reference register 14 has the same input structure and control as the signal register 12 and the same output end as the second reference register 16 . The input channel width of the second register 16 is selected such that the ratio of the input widths a of the first and second reference registers 14, 16 matches the ratio of the dynamic range and desired bias level of the signal register. All three registers are clocked synchronously, but the input of the second register is charge saturated while the other registers are biased to the same degree. The output charges of the two reference registers 14, 16 are compared and their difference is fed back to the inputs to the signal register and first reference register to adjust the bias level.

INPUT STRUCTURE FOR CHARGE COUPLED DEVICES WITHCONTROLLABLE INPUT BIAS The present invention relates generally to charge coupled devices CCD s with registers, such asCCD delay lines, for transferring electrical charges.More particularly, the invention relates to an input structure for CCD s capable of automatic adjustment of aDC. input bias charge. Recently, CCD delay lines have come to be widely used in television sets and the like for delay processing. When employed in television sets, CCD delay lines are used for delay processing of analog signals, such as video signals. A DC input bias charge is commonly applied to an input section to which input signals for the CCD delay line are applied. In the prior art, this input bias is provided by external amplitude control of some sort. The external control is adjusted to apply a bias charge at a predetermined level to the input section of the CCD.In this conventional structure, the input bias level tends to fluctuate due to variations in the temperaturedependent characteristics of the input section. In addition, difficult ies have been encountered in accurately adjusting the input bias charge by means of the external amplitude control. For example, US A 4,139,784 discloses an CCD input circuit capable of adjusting the DC input bias to a CCD signal register serving as a CCD delay line. Feedback control of the DC input bias is performed by comparing the electric charge transferred through a reference register with a constant reference signal from a reference voltage source. However, the difficulty mentioned above cannot be avoided even with this structure since adjustment of the reference voltage from the reference voltage source would still be necessary. Furthermore, it may be difficult to adjust the reference voltage in precise correspondance to variations in the properties of the reference register due to unavoidable influences, in particular t ture variations. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an input structure for a charge coupled device capable of automatic adjustment of the wet bias charge. Another object of the invention is to provide an input structure for a charge coupled device which can eliminate the influence of temperature variations on the DC input bias. In order to accomplish the aforementioned and other objects, in accordance with the present invention, a CCD system is provided with a reference voltage source which produces a reference signal to be compared with the electric charge transferred through a reference register. The input bias on the reference register is feedback controlled in accordance with difference between the charge transferred through the reference register and the reference signal value. The operating conditions of the reference voltage source are adjusted to match those of the reference register so that the reference signal value varies in accordance with the operating conditions of the reference register. Preferably, the reference voltage source comprises another reference register rated at a given fraction of the maximum charge value of the reference register. The input section of the reference register is coupled to the input section of a CCD signal register to apply substantially the same input bias to the latter as is applied to the former. According to one aspect of the invention, a charge coupled device comprises a signal register for transferring input electric charges therethrough, the signal register having an input section, a first reference register having an input section of substantially the same structure as the input section of the signal register, the first reference register transferring electric charges from its input section to its output section, a feedback circuit connected to the first reference register to receive an electric voltage substantially corresponding to the electric charge transferred through the first reference register, the feedback circuit comparing the electric voltage with a reference voltage which varies solely as a function of the environmental conditions of the first reference register, deriving a feedback signal, and applying the feedback signal to the first reference register for feedback controlling a bias on the first reference register to a given fraction of a maximum charge rating of the first reference register, and means for coupling the signal register to the first reference register for setting a DC input bias of the signal register to substantially the same bias as the first reference register. According to another aspect of the invention, a charge coupled device with automatic adjustment of aDC input bias comprises a signal register adapted to transfer input electric charges, a first reference register adapted to transfer electric charges from its input section to its output section, the first reference register having a first maximum charge rating, a common input gate bridging the signal register and the first reference register, a second reference register constantly supplied with a voltage substantially corresponding to a second maximum charge rating of the second reference register, the second maximum charge rating being a given fraction of the first maximum charge rating, a common output gate bridging the first and second reference registers, and a feedback circuit comparing a first charge transferred through the first reference register and a second charge transferred through the second reference register, deriving a feedback signal having a value corresponding to the difference between the first and second charges, and feedback controlling an input bias on the first reference register to the given fraction of the first maximum charge rating, thereby feedback controlling anDC input bias on the signal register to substantially the same charge level as that on the first reference register. According to a further aspect of the invention, a charge coupled device comprises a semiconductor substrate, a first register formed on the semiconductor substrate and adapted to transfer signal charges in a given direction therethrough, a second register formed on the semiconductor substrate for charge transfer in the given direction and having substantially the same input structure as the first register, a third register formed on the semiconductor substrate for charge transfer in the given direction and having an output structure substantially the same as that of the second register, the maximum charge rating of the third register being a given fraction of the maximum charge rating of the second register, a plurality of electrodes formed on the first, second and third registers for driving the transference of charges through each of the registers and or accumulating charges therein, and means for detecting charges output by the second and third registers and adjusting the charges to be transferred through the second and third registers to the respective output charges. The present invention will be understood more fully from the detailed description given herebelow and from the accompanying drawings of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, which, however should not be taken to limit the invention to the specific embodiments but are for explanation and understanding only. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic cross section of the preferred embodiment of a CCD system according to the present invention, applied to a two phase, buried channel CCD delay line with two level, n channel gate electrodes Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic plan view of the CCD system of Fig. 1 Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are graphs showing the input output transfer characteristics of the CCD delay line Fig. 6 is a diagrammataic partial cross section of another embodiment of the CCD system according to the present invention and Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic partial cross section of a further embodiment of the CCD system according to the present invention. Referring now to the drawings, Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the preferred embodiment of a charge coupled device system CCD system of the present invention in terms of a CCD delay line employing a two phase, buried channel device with two level, n channel gate electrodes. The CCD system has a P type silicon substrate 10 common to a signal register CCD delaying 12, a first reference register 14 and a second reference register 16. The signal register 12 has channel width a and a desired number of gates. The first reference register 14 has substantially the same channel width a as of the signal register 12 and a predetermined channel length Z . The second reference register 16 has substantially the same channel length Ag as first reference register 14.The input end section 18 of the second reference register 16 hasachannel width a 2, i.e. only half of that of the first reference register 14 and a predetermined channel length 1 The output end section 20 of the second reference register 16 has the same channel width as the other two registers 12r 14 and a predetermined channel length 2. The input and output end channels of register 16 are joined by a section of tapering width. The channels of registers 12, 14 and 16 are ribbons of N type doped silicon sandwiched between the P type silicon substrate 10 and an insulating layer 27 of silicon dioxide. It should be appreciated that although a specific CCD system has been illustrated.to facilitate discussion of the present invention in detail, the invention can be employed in various types of CCD systems for example, as is well known, CCD s can be of either surfaces or buried channel type and can be driven by any of a number of control signal phasing schemes. It should also be appreciated that other electrode structures, such as single layer or triplelayer, may be employed, and metal and polysilicon electrodes may be employed. The signal register 12 has a source region 22 which comprises an N diffusion in the P type silicon substrate 10. The signal register 12 also has first and second input polysilicon gate electrodes 24 and 26 deposited on the insulating layer 27 and mutually insulated by an interleaved insulating layer 32 of silicon dioxide. The signal register 12 also has a plurality of first level electrodes 28 and a plurality of second level electrodes 30 all of polysilicon and mutually insulated by SiO2 layers 32. The first and second input gate electrodes 24 and 26 extend over the channel of the first reference register 14 so that they also serve as input gate electrodes for the latter. The first and second level electrodes 28 and 30 extend over both the first and second reference registers 14 and 16 to serve in pairs as shift staging electrodes for each. The first reference register 14 has a source region 34 which is similar to that in the signal register 12 and comprises an N diffusion in P type silicon substrate 10. The first reference register 14 also has a N floating diffusion region 36 and another diffusion region used as a pre charge drain region 38 following the floating diffusion region 36 but separated from the latter by a short section of a channel. The first reference register 14 also has an output gate 40 42, both of polysilicondeposited on the SiO2 insulator 27.The output gate 40 and the pre charge gate 42 also extend over the second reference register 16 so as to serve as output gate and the pre charge gate for the latter. The second reference register 16 also has a source region 44 comprising an N diffusion region in the P type silicon substrate 10. The source region 44 is similar geometrically to the source regions of the signal register 12 and the first reference register 14.The second reference register 16 also has a N floating diffusion region 46 which is similar to that with reference number 36 in the first reference reqisterl4.A pre charge drain region 48 in the second reference register 16 correcponding to that with the reference number 38 in the first register 14 is similarly separated fran the floating diffusion region 46 by a short section of a channel. First level and second level transfer electrodes 50 and 52 are also formed on the third register 16. The first and second level transfer electrodes 50 and 52, made of polysilicon, are located at positions corresponding to the first and second input gate electrodes 24 and 26 of the signal register 12 and the first reference register 14. The operating states of the two switches 54 and 70 control the charge on the floating diffusion regions 36 and 46, respectively. The pre charge drain regions 38 and 48 serve to drain the charge floating diffusion regions 36 and 46, respectively at a timing in synchronism with operation of the switches 54 and 70. For instance, an electric charge or a potential in the floating diffusion regions 36 and 46 are reset to VDD as constantly applied to the pre charge drain region 38 and 48 when a resetting clock is applied to the pre charge gate 42.The resetting clock to be applied to the pre charge gate 42 is to be produced at a timing synchronized with the opening of the switches 54 and 70 with a given substantially short delay By transferring the charge or potential to the pre charge drain regions 38 and 48, the potential in the floating diffusion regions 36 and 46 is reset to VDD The floating diffusion region 36 is connected to the inverting input terminal 56 of a differential amplifier 58 via a source follower amplifier 60 and a switch 54. The source follower 60 comprises two source drain connected MOS FET s 62 and 64. Though the switch 54 is represented by a manual throw switch symbol in the drawings, it may be and usually will be a MOSFET switch. Similarly, the second floating diffusion region 46 is also connected to the positive or non inverting input terminal 66 of the differential amplifier 58 via a source follower 68 and a switch 70. As in the source follower 60, the source follower 68 comprises MOSFET 72 and 74. Again, the symbolically illustrated switch 70 will in practice be a MOS FET. The switch ON timing of the switches 54 and 70 are controlled by a sample hold signal to pass the voltage corresponding to the transferred charge through the first and second registers 14 and 16. The sample hold signal may provide a duty cycle for controlling the switch ON timing in synchronism with the transfer of the charge through the registers 14 and 16.Therefore, the signalling timing would by synchronized with the signalling timing of the clocks Qll and The output terminal 76 of differential amplifier 58 is connected directly to the source region 34 of the first reference register 14 and to the source region 22 via a resistor 77. The source region 22 is also connected in parallel with resistor 77 to a signal source 78 via a capacitor 80. The resistor 77 is inserted to isolate the signal source 78 from the differential amplifier 58 and the first reference register 14. It should be emphasized that the source followers 60 and 80, switches 54 and 70, the differential amplifier 58, the resistor 77 and the capacitor 80 may be formed on the same chip as the registers 10, 14 and 16 The operation of the CCD system described above will be explained in detail. In the following description of the operation, the DC bias applied to the signal register 12 is assumed to be at the midpoint VO in Fig 3 of the dynamic range of the signal register. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a power source 82 is connected to the source region 44 of the second reference register 160 The power source 82 is rated so as to keep the electric charge in the source region 44 saturated, in other words, to keep its potential on full carrier charged level. The first level electrodes 28 and 50 cooperate with the adjacent second level electrodes 30 and 52 to drive electric charges from potential well to potential well along the buried channels. In the direction of transfer each electric charge packet is determined by the potential difference between adjacent potential wells which in turn is determined by the voltage levels of the two phase clock signals 1 2 coupled to a battery 84 as well as other operating signals described later.That is, electric charge packets migrate among the asymmetrical potential wells at the various gates and electrodes until they find the local potential minima or voltage maxima. Each electric charge thus transferred through the second reference register 16 and output through the floating diffusion region 46 is converted into a corresponding voltage by the source follower 68. The converted voltage is sample held by the switch 70. The switch 70 thus supplies a voltage corresponding to the maximum charge rating of the second reference register 16 to the positive input terminal 66 of the differential amplifier 58. Since the source region 44 of the second reference register 16 is always saturated, the voltage applied to the positive input terminal 66 of the differential amplifier 58 constantly corresponds to the full rating of the second reference register 16. Upon starting the CCD system, the input voltage at the negative input terminal 56 of the differential amplifier 58 is zero, since there is no electric charge transferred to the floating diffusion region 36 of the first reference register 14. At this time, since a voltage corresponding to the maximum charge rating of the second reference register 16 is applied to the positive input terminal, the output voltage of the differential amplifier 58 corresponds to the maximum charge rating of the second reference register 16. The output voltage of the differential amplifier 58 serves as a feedback voltage for the first reference register 14.The feedback voltage from the differential amplifier 58 increases the depth of the potential well at the source region 34 of the first reference register 14 by an amount corresponding to the feedback voltage, which, in turn, corresponds to the full rated charge of the second reference register 16. When predetermined sampling pulse voltages V1 and V2 are applied to respective input gate electrodes 24 and 26, an electric charge corresponding to the feedback voltage is transferred to the first level and second level transfer electrodes 28 and 30 from the source region 34. Subsequently, repeated application of the clock pulse voltages 81 and 2 to the first level and second level transfer electrodes 28 and 30 drives the electric charge packets to the floating diffusion region 36 v ia the transfer electrodes. The electric charge transferred to the floating diffusion region is converted into a voltage by the source follower 60. The switch 54 then performs sample holding of the converted voltage. The voltage obtained by sample holding is applied to the negative input terminal 56 of the differential amplifier 58. Since the second reference register 16 has the first level and second level transfer electrodes 28 and 30 and the output gate electrode 40 in common to the first reference register 14, charge transfer is performed in the second reference register 16 at substantially the same timing as in the first reference register 14. As set forth above, the charge applied to the source region 44 of the second reference register 16 corresponds to its maximum charge rating. Therefore, when a charge corresponding to the depth of the potential well in the source region 34 of the first reference register 14 is transferred to the floating diffusion region 36, the charge corresponding to the maximum charge rating of the second reference register 16 is transferred to the floating diffusion region 46 of the second reference register 16.Source followers 60 and 68 operate concurrently to convert the charge in the floating diffusion regions 36 and 46 into voltages. The switches 54 and 70 also operate concurrently. As a result, a voltage corresponding to the maximum charge rating of the second reference register 16 is applied to the positive input terminal 66 of the differential amplifier 58 simultaneously with the voltage from the switch 54. The differential amplifier 58 outputs through its output terminal 76 a voltage corresponding to the difference between the input voltages. The output voltage of the differential amplifier 58 is fed back to the source region 34 of the first reference register 14.The feedback voltage from the differential amplifier 58 adjusts the depth of the potential well of the source region 34, specifically such that the difference between the input voltages of the differential amplifier 58 is reduced to zero. As a result, the charge transferred through the first reference register 14 is held as close as possible to the full charge transferred through the second reference register 16. In other words, this feedback control causes the charge transferred through the first reference register 14 to match the charge output of the second reference register 16, i.e., the maximum charge rating of the second reference register 16. As set forth above, the width of the input end section 18 of the second reference register 16 is half that of the first reference register 14, and thus the maximum charge rating of the first reference register 14 is twice that of the second reference register 16. Since the charge transferred through the first reference register 14 is feedback controlled to correspond to the maximum handling charge of the second reference register, the first reference register 14 handles half 1 2 of its maximum charge rating. In other words, the first reference register 14 operates under a bias of 1 2 of its maximum charge rating. The first reference register 14 employs the first and second input gate electrodes 24 and 26 in common with the signal register 12.Also, as set forth above, the first reference register 14 has the same channel width a as the signal register 12 and the structure of the source region 34 matches that of the source region 22 of the signal register 12. Therefore, the signal register 12 has substantially same input structure as the first reference register. As a result, the bias condition of the signal register 12 will always be substantially equal to that of the first reference register 14. In other words, the bias on the signal register 12 substantially corresponds to 1 2 of the maximum charge rating of the first reference register 14. This bias condition is illustrated in Fig. 3.As shown in Fig. 4, the signal register will operate at the center of its dynamic range, which is specially advantageous when the input from the signal source 78 is in the form of a sine wave. According to the above embodiment, due to the effect of the differential amplifier and the feedback control of the depth of the potential well of the first reference register 14, the DC bias on the signal register 12 can be automatically controlled to the center 1 2 of its dynamic range. Therefore, according to the shown embodiment, it is no longer necessary to employ a conventional amplitude control for adjustment of the DC bias on the signal register. Furthermore, it is also unnecessary to manually adjust the DC bias on the signal register, as the DC bias can be automatically controlled.In addition, since the first reference register 14 has substantiallyth ame input structure as the signal register 12 and has substantiall P same output structure as that of the second reference register 16, the input section of the first reference register 14 will be influenced by the same temperature variation as that subject to the input section of the signal register 12. On the other hand, the output section of the first register 14 will be subject to the influences of the same temperature variations as the output section of the second output register 16. As a result, the bias on the first reference register 14 can be maintained accurately at 1 2 its maximum charge rating.Thus, theDC input bias on the signal register 12 can be of constantly maintained at 1 2 the maximum charge rating irrespective of temperature variations. In order to fabricate the input end section of the second reference register 16 at a channel width of precisely 1 2 the width a of the first reference register 14 and the signal register 12 in order to obtain a DC input bias corresponding to 1 2 its maximum charge rating, the photo mask pattern used during the exposure process in semi conductor IC fabrication process should be designed to have an input channel of the proper width. According to the present invention, the DC bias level can be set with very high accuracy simply by proper design of the photo mask pattern. This production process also ensures good reproducability. Furthermore, in accordance with the shown embodiment, since the channels of the signal register 12, the first reference register 14 and the second reference register 16 are aligned parallel to each other, the first level transfer electrodes 28 and the second level transfer electrodes 30 can conveniently be formed in common with all three registers 12, 14 and 16.Additionally, this allows the first and second input electrodes 24 and 26 of the signal register 12 and the first reference register 14 to be conveniently formed in common. Similarly, the output gate electrode 40 and the pre charge gate 42 of the first and second reference register 14 and 16 can be formed in common. Although the aforementioned preferred embodiment has been directed to a CCD system with a signal register DC input bias set in the center of its dynamic range, the invention is not limited to this specific level, but rather can be selected to be any arbitrary value. It is only necessary to select the width of the second reference register in relation to the width of the first reference register to obtain the desired level of DC input bias. For instance, if a DC input bias lying at 3 4 of the maximum charge rating or if a dynamic range is preferred, as shown in Fig. 5, then the width of the input end section 18 of the second reference register 16 should be 3a 4, where a is the channel width of the first reference register 14 and the signal register 12. In this case, the input bias will be clamped at the voltage level of 3 4 of the dynamic range of the signal register. In the aforementioned embodiment, the charge transferred through the first and second reference registers 14 and 16 are output to the source followers 60 and 68 through the floating diffusions regions 36 and 46 and then input to the input terminals 56 and 66 of the differential amplifier 58. However, the structure shown in Fig. 6, for example, may be used instead. In this embodiment, N floating gates 100 and 102 made of polysilicon are formed on the P type silicon substrate 10. The floating gates 100 and 102 are connected to the source followers 60 and 68, respectively. With this arrangement, the charge transferred through the first and second reference registers 14 and 16 can be sensed as image forces produced at the floating gates. Reset switches 104 are connected to the floating gates 100 and 102 to control their potentials.The charges at the floating gates 100 and 102 are fed to the corresponding input terminals 56 and 66 of the 58 differential amplifier in the form of voltages corresponding to the respective charges via the source followers 60 and 68. As in the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, the output of the differential amplifier 58 is fed back to the first reference register 14 to control the bias thereof and accordingly the DC input bias on the signal register. Fig. 7 shows a further embodiment of the CCD system according to the present invention. In this system, the pre charge drain regions 38 and 48 are connected to power source VDD via resistors 110 and 112.The input terminals 56 and 66 of the differential amplifier 58 are connected between the pre charge drain gates 38 and 48 and the resistors 110 and 112, respectively. As a result, voltages respectively corresponding to the voltage drops across the resistors 110 and 112 and the pre charge drain regions 38 and 48 are applied to the input terminals 56 and 66 of the differential amplifier. Therefore, according to this embodiment, the differential amplifier compares the voltage drops respectively effected by the pre charge drain regions 38 and 48. The output of the differential amplifier 58 is used as a feedback signal to feedback control the bias on the first reference register 14 to the desired fraction of its maximum charge rate. As a result, the DC input bias on the signal register 12 can be controlled automatically. Although the shown embodiments employ a diode cut off system for inputting signals to the source regions 22, 34 and 44 of the signal register 12 and the first and second reference registers 14 and 16 by exerting a voltage on the source region, other input systems, such as a potential balance system, can be employed. When some other input system is used, the connections to the differential amplifier should be adapted accordingly so that the charge transferred through the first reference register can be constantly and automatically controlled to 1 2 of its maximum charge rate. As will be appreciated herefrom, various modifications can be made without departing from the principle of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should be understood as to include all of the possible embodiments and modifications providing for the same or similar effects to those illustrated hereabove. In particular, the invention should not be understood as being specifically for application to a two phase, buried channel CCD device with twolevel, n channel gate electrodes but should be appreciated to include various types of CCD systems including surface channel types as well as buriedchannel types, and with any practically reasonable number of clock phases.
