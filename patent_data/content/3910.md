# DIVIDER KEYER CIRCUIT FOR SYNTHESIS ORGAN

## Abstract
A divider keyer circuit arrangement for a synthesis organ utilizing four integrated circuit chips to generate the notes for a 61 key manual with 9 harmonic drawbars or tabs. On chip cross wiring and the use of clock lines for synchronization pulses and other design techniques enable the use of four identical integrated circuit chips in standard 40 pin packages to be used to generate the full complement of notes for a 61 note keyboard.
