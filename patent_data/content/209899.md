## Description
The present invention relates to an improved water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable. A water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable is known from Wire Journal International, Vol. 16, No. 9, September 1983, Development of a Waterproof Crosslinked Polyethylene Cable , Uchiyama et alia, p.p. 178 189, having a water impervious layer of a laminated tape comprising a metal foil and an electrically conductive film formed directly around a cable core or through another coating layer as well as a hold tape layer and a metal shield layer formed sequentially on the cable core. The cable core has a conductor shield, a rubber or plastic insulation layer and an insulation shield which are formed on a conductor. Crosslinked polyethylene, an ethylene propylene rubber and the like are mainly used as insulation layer in water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cables having such a structure. Laminated tapes comprising lead or a lead alloy and polyolefin are mainly used as plastic laminated tapes constituting water impervious layers since they have excellent flexibility and chemical resistance. In addition, semiconductive cloth tapes are generally used as hold tapes applied on water impervious layers. A semiconductive cloth tape is obtained by friction treating a woven fabric with electrically conductive rubber. The warps and wefts of the woven fabric are, in general, cotton yarn, viscose rayon yarn, acetate yarn, vinylon yarn, nylon yarn, or polyester yarn. In the manufacture of water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cables having the above conventional structure, a laminated tape comprising a metal foil and a plastic film is longitudinally applied on the cable core. After a hold tape is wound on the laminated tape, heating is performed to bond the laminated tape to the cable core, thereby forming a water impervious layer. In this case, the adhesive strength between the laminated tape and the cable core is largely influenced by the temperature and time during heating. That is, the higher the heating temperature and heating time, the higher the adhesive strength obtained. A water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable manufactured in the manner described above, however, has the following problems. A semiconductive cloth tape normally used as a hold tape on a conventional water impervious layer has a memory rate of expansion and contraction of 0 to 15 . Therefore, when a water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable having a hold tape constituted by such a tape is subjected to repeated bending, the water impervious tape cracks along the edge of the hold tape layer. When the cable is subjected to a heat cycle of 130 C R.T. Room Temperature with power applied to the conductor, as the cable core expands or contracts, the water impervious layer comprising a metal plastic laminated tape bonded on the core also expands or contracts. However, the hold tape on the water impervious layer, once expanded, cannot contract. Therefore, when other layers expand and then contract, the hold tape layer forms wrinkles. Such wrinkles in the hold tape layer cause damage to the water impervious layer formed within the hold tape layer and or the metal shield layer formed around the hold tape layer, thereby significantly degrading the characteristics of the cable. The invention is defined in claim 1. The memory rate of expansion and contraction, which represents the degree of contraction of a yarn is an index for stretchability of a fabric of the yarn and is calculated in accordance with JIS Japanese Industrial Standard L 1090 by the following equation In view of the fact as described above for a water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable, extensive studies have been made and it has been found that the above problems can be effectively solved for a water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable by the holding tape comprising a tape comprising a synthetic resin fiber cloth and an electrically conductive rubber, the synthetic resin fiber cloth having a memory rate of expansion and contraction, of at least 30 in the transverse or longitudinal or both directions of the tape the memory rate of expansion and contraction A being given by This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which According to the present invention, an electrically conductive tape using as a base cloth a woven fabric obtained by weaving a yarn having a memory rate of expansion and contraction of 30 or more is used as a hold tape formed on a water impervious layer. Therefore, the hold tape can follow the movement of the cable core, and therefore does not cause twisting or shifting or form wrinkles. The effect of this hold tape layer is further enhanced when a lubricant such as silicone resin, graphite powder, talc, paraffin, hydrocarbon resin, fatty amide, fatty ester, carbon powder, or a stearate is applied on the surface of this electrically conductive tape. In order to impart good characteristics to a cable, a yarn having a memory rate of expansion and contraction of 40 or more is used for the woven fabric, and wefts have a larger elongation than warps. The weaving method can be plain weaving, diagonal weaving, or twill weaving. As the material for the yarn, a synthetic resin material having a low hygroscopicity is preferable. Preferred examples of such resin materials may include nylon, polyester, polybutylene terephthalate, polyurethane, and polypropylene. As a yarn having a memory rate of expansion and contraction of 30 or more by crimping, wooly tetron, wooly nylon, and P.B.T. fiber Samora available from Toray Industries, Inc. are commercially available. As an electrically conductive rubber to be formed on at least one side of a woven fabric as a base material for a hold tape, an electrically conductive compound obtained by drying a solvent solution of a mixture of butyl rubber as a base and an electrically conductive carbon black such as Ketjenblack EC trade name of AKZO Co. or acetylene black and by vulcanizing the mixture by heating is used. The electrically conductive tape forming the hold tape has a volume resistivity of 5 x 10⁶ Ω cm or less. When at least one side of the electrically conductive rubber layer formed on the semiconductive woven fabric is subjected to a smoothening treatment by topping or the like, better results are obtained in respect to stress relaxation in and prevention of external damage to the water impervious layer. In the water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable according to the present invention, the water impervious layer formed under the hold tape layer comprises a laminated tape comprising a metal foil of lead, copper, aluminum or the like, 20 to 200 µm in thick, and an electrically conductive plastic film having a thickness of 20 to 200 µm and a volume resistivity of 10⁶ Ω cm or less. A copper wire or copper tape is used for a metal shield layer to be formed around the hold tape layer. A laminated tape using a lead or lead alloy foil is most preferred since it is flexible to provide excellent formability and can impart excellent chemical resistance to the cable. Crosslinked polyethylene, polyethylene, ethylene propylene rubber or the like is used for the insulation layer. Although a stranded conductor is normally used as a conductor, in applications where water infiltration from the conductor side is feared and must be prevented, a watertight conductor obtained by filling the gaps between the strands with an electrically conductive watertight compound is used. Although the electrically conductive watertight compound is not limited to a particular type, a mixture developed by the present inventors comprising 100 parts of butyl rubber trade name polysar butyl , 10 to 30 parts of conductive carbon black trade name Ketjenblack EC , and 100 to 200 parts of calcium carbonate, and having a volume resistivity of 10⁶ Ω cm or less is preferable due to its excellent filling and other properties. In a water impervious rubber or plastic insulated power cable according to the present invention, since no wrinkles are formed in the hold tape layer, the inner water impervious layer and the outer metal shield layer are not adversely affected and the cable can exhibit excellent characteristics over a long period of time, thereby providing excellent industrial effects.
