## Description
This invention relates to spatial temporal frequency interleaving of a video signal. A desirable objective of high definition television is a picture that is sharper and more pleasing than is provided by broadcast and television receiver equipment presently in general use. Some of the features proposed for a high definition television system include the following increasing the line rate over the conventional 525 or 625 lines per frame to, for example, 1,050 or 1,250 lines per frame extending the aspect ratio from a conventional 4 3 aspect ratio to an aspect ratio such as 5 3 and increasing the effective resolution of the picture. A high definition television system that attempts to provide most or all of these features has heretofore required either a substantial increase in bandwidth of the transmission channel or a substantial compromise in the specifications for one or more of the features described above. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, spatial temporal frequency interleaving techniques are used to rearrange the spatial temporal frequency spectrum of the image in such a way as to reduce the channel bandwidth requirement for transmission of the image without substantially reducing the desired information content of the image. The concept of spatial temporal frequency interleaving involves the separation of high spatial and or temporal frequency information of an image and modulating this information on a spatial temporal carrier which interleaves the high frequency information with the low frequency information of the baseband spectrum. An advantage of interleaving high frequency information is that since the eye is relatively insensitive to distortion at high spatial frequencies, artifacts introduced by the interleaving will, in general, not be objectionable. When the high definition television signal processing system incorporates sampling techniques, high frequency carriers are inherently introduced in the form of spectral repeat centers by means of the sampling procedure. As a feature of the invention, great flexibility is available in selecting the carriers or repeat centers at particular points in the spatial temporal frequency volume. The effect of using spatial temporal carrier generation is to reconfigure the spectrum of the image, transmitting a portion of the baseband spectrum in a different location of the spatial temporal frequency volume see for example Frequenz , Vol. 27, no. 11 12, Nov Dec 1983, pages 288 299, Berlin H. Sauerburger et al. Verarbeitung und digitale Codierung von HDTV Signalen . In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a video signal is developed that contains an image having associated therewith a spatial temporal frequency spectrum of at least two dimensions. A modulated signal is produced that represents spatial temporal carrier modulation by the image contained in the video signal to generate repeat spectra of at least a section of the image spectrum. The carrier modulation is designed to position a repeat spectrum adjacent to the image spectrum, such that a section of the adjacent repeat spectrum is interleaved in a complementary location adjacent the image spectrum. The video signal is filtered prior to the production of the modulated signal to remove spectral contents of the image that are positioned at the complementary location adjacent that portion of the image spectrum that is to be transmitted. Thus, for example, if the image spectrum includes a temporal dimension, scene motion artifacts are avoided that are due to interaction between the frequency interleaved sections and the temporal content of the original image spectrum. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, to reconstruct the spatial temporal spectrum of the frequency interleaved video signal, a first signal is produced that represents spatial temporal carrier modulation of the spatial temporal frequency spectrum of the frequency interleaved signal and that contains the removed section of the image spectrum restored to its original location. The first signal is filtered to remove from its spectrum undesirable portions of repeat spectra. A second signal is developed from the filtered signal that contains the reconstructed image spectrum. As will be described, the carrier modulation tends to introduce a full strength alias which could result in undesirable artifacts being displayed together with the picture information. These effects may be substantially reduced by transmitting the interleaved spectral section with diminished amplitude relative to a remaining spectral section of the transmitted video signal.At the receiver, a complementary process is performed that represents spatial temporal carrier modulation of the spatial temporal frequency interleaved video signal. The interleaved section is restored to its original position in the image spectrum, while at the same time, its amplitude is increased. When a high definition television signal processing system incorporates sampling techniques, high frequency carriers are inherently introduced in the form of spectral repeat centers by means of the sampling procedure. When analog processing circuitry is used, spatial repeat spectra may be introduced, for example, by modulating an appropriately selected carrier wave with the video signal. Great flexibility is available in selecting the spatial temporal carriers that generate repeat centers at particular points in the spatial temporal frequency volume. The effect of using spatial temporal carrier generation is to reconfigure the spectrum of the image, transmitting a portion of the baseband spectrum in a different location of the spatial temporal frequency volume. In an embodiment of the invention, the baseband spatial temporal frequency spectrum of the video signal is configured so as to enable rectangular sections of the spectrum to be interleaved. The baseband frequency spectrum used may, for instance, be a cruciform shaped region.Such a spectrum is capable of providing improved horizontal and vertical resolution at the expense of diagonal resolution. This type of trade off may produce a more pleasing picture, taking into account the physiology of the eye and the perception of images by the visual system. Additional advantages ensue if one extracts from the baseband video spectrum for the purpose of frequency interleaving, a spectral section of such shape and orientation as to enable the sides of the section to be oriented parallel to the horizontal and vertical directions. In general, spatial temporal frequency interleaving techniques substitute one piece of spatial information, such as information contained in the high horizontal frequencies, in place of another piece of information, such as information contained in diagonal frequencies, both of which are relatively high frequency spatial information. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, different pieces of spatial information, such as diagonal and high horizontal frequency information, are advantageously transmitted to the receiver by alternating or temporally multiplexing transmission of the pieces of information at a given rate such as at the frame rate. Thus, the video signal of an image containing diagonal frequency information is transmitted in one frame, while the video signal of an image containing high horizontal frequency information is transmitted in the alternate frame. Assuming a frame rate of 30 Hertz, the visual artifacts introduced into such a transmission system is a half frame rate, 15 Hertz flicker. By way of illustration only, assume that it is desired to reconfigure the transmitted luminance spatial frequency spectrum of an image so that the spectrum better matches the properties of the human visual system. For the purposes of this discussion only, assume that the original baseband spatial frequency spectrum, f One of the factors determining the maximum horizontal spatial resolution transmitted is the bandwidth of the channel allocated to carry the video signal. Channel bandwidth is therefore an important factor in determining the maximum horizontal spatial frequency, f Experiments have indicated, however, that the human visual response to spatial frequencies is limited to be within a diamond shaped area as suggested by the spatial frequency spectrum 23 of FIGURE 1A. The diamond shaped area 23 of FIGURE 1A has the same Nyquist area as the rectangular shaped area 21 of FIGURE 1B. Thus, an improvement in the displayed image quality may be realized by decreasing the diagonal resolution available in the frequency spectrum of FIGURE 1B in exchange for increasing either vertical or horizontal resolution. In FIGURE 1A, the increased resolution is in the horizontal direction. The horizontal spatial frequencies in diamond shaped spectrum 23 of FIGURE 1A extend out to a frequency 2f In accordance with an aspect of the invention, by means of spatial frequency interleaving, a signal having a spectrum like that of area 23 of FIGURE 1A may be transmitted through the same narrowband transmission channel used to transmit a signal having a spectrum like that of FIGURE 1B. Before frequency interleaving is attempted so as to permit the transmission of an image containing 2f The two dimensional orthogonal sampling procedure schematically illustrated by the sampling point grid of FIGURE 2A gives rise to a plurality of rectangular repeat spectra 22r in the spatial frequency domain, as illustrated in FIGURE 2B. The repeat spectra 22r have repeat centers C that form an orthogonal grid with frequency spacing in the horizontal direction of 4f The sampled signal is then two dimensionally digitally filtered to filter the baseband spectrum into the diamond shaped area 23 and to filter the repeat spectra into diamond shaped areas 23r, as indicated by all the shaded areas of FIGURE 3. The next step in the frequency interleaving process is the appropriate sampling of the signal to create additional repeat spectra in the void areas adjacent the baseband spectrum 23 of FIGURE 3. By choosing quincunx subsampling, one may locate additional repeat spectra in a complementary and nonoverlapping manner with respect to the existing diamond shaped baseband spectrum 23 and diamond shaped repeat spectra 23r of FIGURE 3. One type of quincunx subsampling is the field quincunx sampling procedure illustrated by the sampling point grid of FIGURE 4A. Other quincunx subsampling such as line and frame quincunx subsampling may be used. In field quincunx subsampling, alternate ones of the original pixels are discarded on a line interleaved basis. The sampling point grid that results is illustrated in FIGURE 4A and forms a non orthogonal quincunx, or figure of five pattern. The field quincunx subsampling may be achieved by subsampling interlaced video lines at half the original horizontal sampling rate and by additionally altering the phase of the sampling clock on a field by field basis, as will be later explained during the discussion of hardware implementation. The effect of field quincunx subsampling in the frequency domain is illustrated in FIGURE 4B. Additional repeat spectra 23r are introduced having repeat centers C such that the origin O or any one of the repeat centers C or C , together with the corresponding 4 adjacent repeat centers, form a figure of five pattern. The shape of the additional repeat spectra 23r is identical to the shape of baseband spectrum 23. The repeat center C is spaced apart from another center C by an amount 4f FIGURE 4C illustrates a portion of the frequency space of FIGURE 4B that includes only those repeat spectra 23r that are adjacent to baseband spectrum 23 and are centered on repeat centers C . In FIGURE 4C, one may partition the baseband frequency spectrum 23 into four sections, 1, 2, 3, 4. Corrresponding sections, containing identical image and spatial frequency content but centered around a repeat center C , are identified as sections 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . In accordance with an aspect of the invention, after subsampling has been performed, the signal is postfiltered to keep the spatial frequencies of the signal within the limits required for transmission through a limited bandwidth channel. Assume, illustratively, that for various reasons, including limited channel bandwidth, it is desirable to transmit a signal having associated therewith spatial frequencies no greater than f The resultant transmitted spatial frequency spectrum after post filtering has the rectangular shape of solid line rectangle 121 of FIGURE 4D, with a horizontal cutoff at the frequency f In addition, because of spatial frequency interleaving, the image content of the entire baseband spectrum 23 has been preserved in rectangular shaped spectrum 121 of FIGURE 4D without loss of any baseband frequency information. The baseband information for frequencies extending beyond f In FIGURE 4D, frequency sections 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, of baseband spectrum 23 have been removed due to the low frequency cutoff f One notes that a feature of the inventive frequency interleaving technique just described is the ability of a limited bandwidth channel to transmit high spatial frequency content information by rearranging the original spectrum to fill up the entire Nyquist area of the transmitted signal. At the receiver, the original baseband spectrum, such as the diamond shaped baseband spectrum 23 of FIGURE 1A, may be reconstructed from a signal having a spatial frequency spectrum such as rectangular spectrum 121 of FIGURE 4D, by means of a complementary quincunx subsampling process, as will be described later. FIGURE 5 illustrates an encoder 20 which implements the spatial temporal frequency interleaving technique previously described. In FIGURE 5, a two to one interlaced baseband video signal V Baseband video signal V Baseband video signal V The digitized and sampled video signal is then applied to a spatial low pass filter 26 that filters baseband spectrum 22 into diamond shaped baseband area 23 of FIGURE 3 and filters repeat spectra 22r into diamond shaped repeat spectra 23r. Spatial low pass filter 26 may be any one of several conventional type digital filters such as a maximally flat filter of order N. The higher the order of the filter, the sharper the frequency cutoff characteristics of the filter. However, the higher the order of the filter, the more complex is the hardware rehired to implement the filter. On the other hand, sharp cutoff spatial filters may introduce perceptually undesirable sidelobes into the image space of the transformed spatial frequency impulse response functions. The filter also incorporates a field store to enable the filter to process adjacent lines of the interlaced signal. If a non interlaced signal were to be processed, then the filter would not require a full field store. After the signal has been filtered into diamond shaped baseband and repeat spectra, the signal is reconfigured in its spatial frequencies to satisfy the bandwidth requirements imposed upon it by the transmission channel used. For example, assume the bandwidth of the channel that receives the frequency interleaved signal from the output of encoder 20 has a limited bandwidth that enables the transmission of horizontal spatial frequencies only up to a maximum frequency of f To accomplish this reconfiguration, the output of spatial low pass filter 26 of FIGURE 5 is applied to a switch 30 that produces field quincunx subsampling of the video signal in the sampling pattern illustrated in FIGURE 4A. Switch 30 passes every other input sample from low pass filter 26 on a phase alternating, line by line basis, in response to the application of the half rate sampling clock signal f The signal f To produce the correct switching of quincunx switch 30, the signal V,ck toggles a T type flip flop 28 to develop on a field alternating basis high and low states at the output of the flip flop. The output of flip flop 28 is coupled to the select input terminal S of a multiplexer MUX 29.

Each of the delay elements is clocked by the f The output of adder 68 is the interpolated sample x FIGURE 6 illustrates a decoder 40 in the television receiver that will reconstruct the diamond shaped baseband spectrum 23 of FIGURE 1A from the frequency interleaved baseband video signal V As the first step in reconstructing the diamond shaped baseband spectrum, the frequency interleaved video signal V The subsampled signal y To convert samples y Filter 26 of FIGURE 5 and filter 26 of FIGURE 6 perform analogous functions in frequency interleaving encoder 20 and frequency reconstructing decoder 40, respectively. Each of the two filters takes its respective signal samples and processes them to generate signal samples having diamond shaped spectra. Thus, spatial low pass filters 26 and 26 may be similarly constructed, taking into account the fact that the input sample rate for filter 26 is twice that for filter 26 . The use of sampling for frequency interleaving a high definition television signal is comparable in analog processing to modulating the signal on a carrier in order to interleave the high spatial frequency information with the low spatial frequency information. Assume that the quincunx subsampling of the digitized video signal V In FIGURE 9, a carrier signal s t may be drawn that has maxima and minima corresponding to the values of the samples x The sampling or equivalent carrier modulation tends to introduce a full strength alias described below which could result in undesirable artifacts being displayed together with the picture information. As previously indicated, the effects of aliasing can be substantially reduced by transmitting the interleaved spectral section with diminished amplitude relative to a remaining spectral section of the transmitted video signal. At the receiver, a complementary process is performed that represents spatial temporal carrier modulation of the spatial temporal frequency interleaved video signal. The interleaved section is restored to its original position in the image spectrum, while, at the same time, its amplitude is increased. To explain the origin of the aliasing, one notes that the frequency spectrum of the video modulated carrier signal V b.s t of FIGURE 9A is similar to the one illustrated in FIGURE 9B. The spectrum includes the solid line baseband spectrum out to the frequency f One observes that in FIGURE 9B, the replicated spectrum is at full amplitude compared to the baseband spectrum. To avoid the introduction of objectionable artifacts in the displayed picture, it is desirable to reduce the amplitude of the replicated spectrum relative to the baseband spectrum. To reduce the amplitude of the replicated spectrum, the signal V The effect of reducing the value of samples x The spectrum of the carrier modulated signal V FIGURE 11 illustrates an encoder 20 which implements the spatial temporal frequency interleaving technique previously described, including a reduced amplitude carrier quincunx switching stage 330. Items in FIGURE 5 and FIGURE 11 that are similarly identified function in a similar manner or represent similar quantities. In FIGURE 11, baseband video signal V The digitized and sampled video signal is then applied to spatial low pass filter 26 that filters baseband spectrum 22 into diamond shaped baseband area 23 of FIGURE 3 and filters repeat spectra 22r into diamond shaped repeat spectra 23r. To accomplish the reconfiguration of the filtered signal into spatial frequencies that satisfy the bandwidth requirements of the transmission channel used, the output of spatial low pass filter 26 is applied to a quincunx switch 330 that produces quincunx subsampling of the video signal in the sampling pattern illustrated in FIGURE 4A. Switch 330 passes through unmodified, to output line 91, every other one of the input samples x The samples x Because of quincunx sampling, the spectrum of the sampled video signal, samples x In filter 150a, the samples x The video samples x The digital video samples x FIGURE 12 illustrates a decoder 40 in the television receiver that will reconstruct the diamond shaped baseband spectrum 23 of FIGURE 1B from the frequency interleaved baseband video signal V As the first step in reconstructing the diamond shaped baseband spectrum, the frequency interleaved video signal V The subsampled signal y Due to the technique, previously described, of reducing the amplitude of the modulated carrier, reconstructed sections 1a through 4a of FIGURE 1A contained in the samples y As illustrated in FIGURE 12 samples y Samples y The samples at the outputs of horizontal low pass filter 83 and coefficient multiplier 81 are coupled to an adder 82 to redevelop signal samples y To convert samples y Filter 26 of FIGURE 11 and filter 26 of FIGURE 12 perform analogous functions in frequency interleaving encoder 20 and frequency reconstructing decoder 40 , respectively. Each of the two filters takes its respective signal samples and processes them to generate signal samples having diamond shaped spectra. Thus, spatial low pass filters 26 and 26 may be similarly constructed, taking into account the fact that the input sample rate for filter 26 is twice that for filter 26 . When the high definition television signal processing system incorporates sampling techniques, high frequency carriers are inherently introduced in the form of spectral repeat centers by means of the sampling procedure. When analog processing circuitry is used, spatial repeat spectra may be introduced, for example, by modulating an appropriately selected carrier wave with the video signal. Great flexibility is available in selecting the spatial temporal carriers that generate repeat centers at particular points in the spatial temporal frequency volume. The effect of using spatial temporal carrier generation is to reconfigure the spectrum of the image, transmitting a portion of the baseband spectrum in a different location of the spatial temporal frequency volume. As previously indicated, the baseband spatial temporal frequency spectrum of a video signal maybe configured so as to enable rectangular sections of the spectrum to be interleaved. The baseband frequency spectrum used may be a cruciform shaped region illustrated in solid line in FIGURE 14. Such a spectrum is capable of providing improved horizontal and vertical resolution at the expense of diagonal resolution. This type of trade off may produce a more pleasing picture, taking into account the physiology of the eye and the perception of images by the visual system. Moreover, additional advantages ensue if one extracts from the baseband video spectrum, for the purpose of frequency interleaving, a spectral section of such shape and orientation so as to enable the sides of the section to be oriented parallel to the horizontal and vertical directions. Both the frequency interleaved encoding of the video signal at the transmitter and the decoding of the frequency interleaved signal at the television receiver may be readily accomplished using analog processing circuitry and a simplified filtering arrangement that is separable into a plurality of one dimensional filters. The analog circuitry encoder modulates an appropriately selected carrier wave, and the analog circuitry decoder demodulates the received spatial temporal frequency interleaved signal. In the analog circuitry illustrated in FIGURE 16, a baseband video signal V Video signal V Baseband video signal V The spatial frequency spectrum of the video signal V Assume that the transmission channel used is capable of transmitting a signal having a Nyquist area equal to that of cruciform region 118 of FIGURES 14A and 14B but is incapable of transmitting horizontal spatial frequencies greater in extent than the spatial frequency f The rearrangement is produced in the following manner by encoder 220. The filtered video signal V Signal D on high pass output line 232 is coupled to a vertical low pass filter 225 which removes vertical spatial frequencies greater in magnitude than the frequency f Signal E on line 233 is coupled to a horizontal low pass filter 226 that removes horizontal spatial frequencies greater in magnitude than the frequency f Consider an image i x,y that is to be transmitted by means of a raster scanning system, where, for simplicity, the temporal dimension associated with the image is omitted from consideration. In the spatial frequency domain, the transform of the image is I f A sinewave grating of given spatial frequency and orientation may be viewed a spatial carrier having two diagonally opposed spectral centers f The raster scanning process maps a given image i x,y onto a given video signal v t . Similarly, the scanning process maps a given spatial carrier S f Each line n of the video carrier signal s t may be of the form Returning now to FIGURE 16 the video signal C on line 235 modulates a carrier signal s t in a modulator 228. By proper selection of s t , the modulation of carrier signal s t by the signal C generates a modulated signal S When video signal C, containing only sections 1 and 5 of FIGURE 14B modulates the video carrier s t , the modulated video signal S The output of an adder 229 is the sum of video signals A, B and S The spatial spectral content of video signal V As previously noted, by filtering the image spectrum to remove original image spectral content at the interleaved locations, artifacts will be avoided that are due to the interaction between the interleaved spectral information. These artifacts will be avoided not only when the image is stationary but even when motion occurs in the image. At the television receiver, a decoder 340, illustrated in FIGURE 17, restores the baseband spatial frequency spectrum of incoming video signal V To separate the interleaved spectral components, video signal V A video signal N is developed on a high pass output signal line 345 of horizontal filter 341. The spatial frequency content of signal N contains only frequencies that are greater in magnitude than the spatial frequency f Signal N is coupled to a vertical filter 342. A video signal Q developed on a low pass output line 347 contains vertical spatial frequencies no greater in magnitude than the frequency f A video signal P is developed on a high pass output signal line 346 of vertical filter 342 and contains vertical spatial frequencies that are greater in magnitude than the frequency f The spectral contents of sections 1a , 1b , 5a , 5b must be returned to their original locations as sections 1a, 1b, 5a, 5b adjacent the horizontal axis f The effect of the video carrier modulation of the video signal P is to produce spatial carrier modulation which introduces spectral centers C The modulation process also introduces undesired spectral sections, not illustrated in FIGURE 15, of horizontal spatial frequencies smaller in magnitude than f To reconstruct the cruciform baseband spectral region 118 of FIGURE 14A video signals M, Q, and S By making certain simplifying selections for the locations of the spatial spectral centers, f As a specific example consider a MAC system using an NTSC two to one scanning interlaced format of 525 scan lines per picture frame, 29.97 frames per second, and a horizontal scanning rate of f The frequency interleaving techniques just described generates a spatial frequency interleaved video signal V In the simplified example, discussed previously, where the frequency of the video carrier signal s t was selected to be an integer multiple of one half the horizontal line frequency, the phase of the video carrier at any given instant is 180 degrees out of phase with the phase of the video carrier one frame time later. The artifacts introduced when processing the interleaved video signal without using a decoder tends to include line crawl along edges of the picture. Such line crawl may be eliminated, if so desired, by inverting the phase of video carrier s t in alternate frames. Several advantages ensue by using a cruciform shaped baseband video signal for frequency interleaving purposes and rectangular sections as the interleaved sections. Encoder 220 of FIGURE 16 and decoder 340 of FIGURE 17 may use relatively simple analog processing stages rather than digital processing stages. Relatively uncomplicated separable horizontal and vertical filters may be used in both the encoder and decoder. The reduced filter complexity facilitates the use of carrier signals selected with relatively few constraints imposed on the choice of signals. The use of rectangular regions 1a, 1b, 5a, 5b, of FIGURES 14B and 15 for the interleaving process substantially reduces visual artifacts in the displayed picture, because separable horizontal and vertical filters approaching ideal filters are readily realizable. In general the use of nonseparable filters with similar roll off characteristics to separable filters requires that substantially more arithemtic operations be performed. For example, an 11 x 11 nonseparable filter nominally requires the use of approximately 121 filter coefficients implemented via multiply and add operations . In contrast, a separable filter arrangement, comprising two nth order one dimensional filters requires the use of only 22 coefficients, approximately, thus resulting in a significant reduction in hardware. If digital processing circuitry is used to sample a baseband video signal at a sampling rate f Having regard to the foregoing description, and in general, one may again state that spatial temporal frequency interleaving techniques substitute one piece of spatial information, such as information contained in the high horizontal frequencies, in place of another piece of information, such as information contained in diagonal frequencies, both of which are relatively high frequency spatial information. FIGURES 18 24 relate to a system in which different pieces of spatial information, such as diagonal and high horizontal frequency information, are transmitted to the receiver by alternating or temporally multiplexing transmission of the pieces of information at a given rate such as at the frame rate. Thus, the video signal of an image containing diagonal frequency information is transmitted in one frame, while the video signal of an image containing high horizontal frequency information is transmitted in the alternate frame. Assuming a frame rate of 30 Hertz, the visual artifacts introduced into such a transmission system is a half frame rate, 15 Hertz flicker. In video signal generator 400 of FIGURE 18, a baseband video signal V The spatial temporal frequency spectrum of video signal V To accomplish the spectral reconfiguration, video signal Vb, a frequency interleaving encoder 220 which may be similar to that described in FIGURE 16, produces a frequency interleaved video signal V Baseband video signal V Video signal V Video signal V FIGURE 19 illustrates a video signal processor 500 in a television receiver that takes the baseband, temporally multiplexed video signal V After the transmitted video signal has been received by the television receiver and processed by the front end stages, such as the tuner and the IF stages, assuming transmission by way of an RF modulated broadcast carrier, and has been demultiplexed and decompressed in a MAC processor, the temporally multiplexed, baseband video signal V In FIGURE 19 video signal V Video signal V Video signal V Video signal V When using video processor 500 of FIGURE 2 to obtain video signal V In FIGURE 20 the temporally multiplexed video signal V Signal T is coupled to a frame store 621 to produce a frame delayed output on a signal line 631 that provides access in two adjacent frames to diagonal sections D1 through D4 and frequency interleaved high horizontal sections 1a , 1b , 5a , 5b . Frame store 621 is clocked at a frequency f₁ by the clock signal F₁,ck. The sampling frequency f₁ and the pixel capacity of frame store 621 is such as to provide full resolution out to horizontal spatial frequencies f The undelayed signal T developed on signal line 626 and the frame delayed signal T developed on signal line 631 are coupled to a double pole double throw switch 624. The two arms of switch 24 are ganged so as to simultaneously switch between their respective contact terminals at a frame rate. During Frame 1, for example, the arm of pole S3 makes contact with terminal S2 and the arm of pole S6 makes contact with terminal S4. During the alternate frame, Frame 2, the arm of pole S3 makes contact with terminal S1 and the arm of pole S6 makes contact with terminal S5. Signal line 626 is coupled to terminals S1 and S4, and signal line 631 is coupled to terminals S2 and S5. During operation, switch 624 temporally demultiplexes the diagonal frequency sections D1 through D4 of signal T from the interleaved high horizontal frequency sections 1a , 1b , 5a , 5b to develop a signal F on a line 627 coupled to pole S3 and a signal G on a line 629 coupled to pole S6. Signal F contains only the interleaved high horizontal frequency sections 1a , 2b , 5a , 5b during Frame 2, when these sections appear in input video signal V Signal F is coupled to a modulator 343. A carrier wave signal s t is also coupled to modulator 343 to produce a carrier demodulated signal S In video signal processor 600 of FIGURE 20 both the diagonal spatial frequency sections D1 through D4 and the high horizontal spatial frequency sections 1a, 1b, 5a, 5b of FIGURE 23 are simultaneously contained in extended video signal V Video signal processor 600 is not subject to a 15 Hertz flicker of the diagonal and high horizontal frequency information. However, because this information is repeated in both Frames 1 and 2, other artifacts may be introduced, such as misregistration of the diagonal and or high frequency horizontal spatial frequencies on moving objects. FIGURE 24A illustrates the spatial frequency spectrum of signal T at the output of horizontal vertical filter 620 of FIGURE 20. Sections H1 through H4 are the high spatial frequency sections that comprise either diagonal sections D1 through D4 during Frame 1 or high horizontal frequency sections 1a , 1b , 5a , 5b during Frame 2. Sections H1 through H4 are spaced from the origin at locations corresponding to the corner locations of spectrums 221 and 321 of FIGURES 22A and 22B. However, unlike spectrums 221 and 321, the spatial frequency spectrum of signal T of FIGURE 24A is devoid of any information inside dashed line rectangle 421 other than the information contained in Sections H1 through H4. Because the range of spatial frequencies in the horizontal direction is the relatively narrow range Δf In accordance with another aspect of the invention, an extended spatial frequency video signal processor 700, illustrated in FIGURE 21, may be used in conjunction with a low capacity frame store 721. In FIGURE 21 the temporally multiplexed video signal V Signal T is coupled to one input of a modulator 722. A carrier wave signal s t is coupled to the other input of the modulator. Modulator 722 produces an amplitude modulation of carrier signal s t by signal T. The amplitude modulated carrier signal S Because the high frequency spatial information sections H1 through H4 are grouped near origin O, a relatively low capacity frame store 721 may be used to sample signal S In addition, the lower vertical spatial frequency resolution of signal S Signal S Signal J is coupled to one input of a modulator 726. Carrier wave signal s t , previously referred to, is coupled to the other input of modulator 726. The modulated signal G developed on line 734 contains the reconstructed diagonal spatial frequency sections D1 through D4, located in their proper corner positions, illustrated in FIGURE 23. Additional undesired low frequency spectral sections, not illustrated, are removed by a low pass filter 737 having a cutoff frequency of f Signal I is coupled to one input of a modulator 725. A carrier wave signal S By having repeat centers C Signals M, S It should be understood that time multiplexing spatial frequency spectra such as described may be extended to multiplexing arrangements other than multiplexing, on a frame alternating basis, the spatial frequency spectrums 221 and 321 of 22A and 22B. For example, a time multiplexing scheme may be provided that transmits diagonal spatial frequency information, high horizontal spatial frequency information and high vertical spatial frequency information. During Frame 1, for example, diagonal spatial frequency information is transmitted during Frame 2, high horizontal spatial frequency information is transmitted and during Frame 3, high vertical spatial frequency information is transmitted. Furthermore, the time multiplexing may be performed on a field by field basis rather than a frame by frame basis. In each of the schemes, tradeoffs must be considered between introducing flickering artifacts, introducing spatial artifacts, and introducing motion artifacts. It will be appreciated that in receivers of MAC type transmissions, the extended spatial frequency luminance signal provided by the described decoders and the chrominance signal components generated by a MAC processor not illustrated in the FIGURES, are matrixed and supplied to the picture tube driver stages for display of the high definition picture content contained in these signals. Although the frequency interleaving techniques have been described by way of example for the luminance signal component of a MAC signal, similar frequency interleaving techniques may be used to extend the spatial frequencies in the chrominance signal components or in other signal formats.
