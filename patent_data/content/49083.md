# Laminated film.

## Abstract
A laminated film 100 comprises an organic polymer film 1 , a thin metal layer 2 having a thickness of 30 to 500 Å lami nated on at least one surface of said organic polymer film, and a transparent thin layer 3 containing metal compounds and having a thickness of 0.02 to 0.3 µ laminated on said thin metal layer 2 . At least 60 wt. of said transparent thin layer 3 com prises zirconium Zr , silicon Si and oxygen, at least 60 molar of metal elements in the above transparent thin layer 3 comprises zirconium Zr and silicon Si ano moiar ratio Zr Si is in the range of 80 20 to 20 80. From said transparent thin layer 3 , an anti reflection having high abrasion resistance, light resistance and heat resistance is formed, Thus, a laminated film having a high vi sible ray transmittance and a high infrared ray reflectance is obtained.
