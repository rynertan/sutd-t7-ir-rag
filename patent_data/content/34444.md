## Description
This invention relates to a method for substantially increasing the acid catalytic activity of members of a unique class of crystalline zeolites by treatment with water under controlled conditions. It is known in the art that the use of steam water and or ammonia can be utilized to modify the activity of acid catalysts, e.g. clays, silica aluminas and zeolites. Much of the emphasis in the field of catalyst activity modification has been directed towards reducing the activity of catalysts. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,016,218 teaches the use reduction of catalytic activity of a class of zeolites having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the approximate range of 1 to 12 by the use of prior thermal treatment. Such prior thermal treatment includes the use of a steam atmosphere. It is also known that the use of ammonia can suppress an initially high activity catalyst. Hydrogen zeolites of the 1 to 12 constraint index type are generally prepared from their alkyl ammonium and ammonium,form precursors by calcining in an inert atmosphere, usually in nitrogen at about 537 C 1000 F . The more costly nitrogen atmosphere is chosen over the cheaper heating in air to avoid temperature runaway and steam formation that is known to damage the catalyst and results in lower activity. Small samples in the laboratory can be calcined in air without significant steam damage if the temperature is controlled by a slow heat up and by allowing any steam formed to diffuse away. With this careful first calcination, hydrogen zeolites result that are free of residual nitrogen compounds and have the maximum number of acidic hydroxyl group, which is equal to the number of framework aluminums. Samples thusly prepared are designated fresh samples . The corresponding catalytic activity of these fresh samples is called initial activity and when measured by the alpha α test as described hereinafter, assigned the designation of α It has long been known that the catalytic activity of hydrogen zeolites can be reduced by high temperature heating and especially by steaming. It is also known that the deactivation due to steam is more pronounced at higher temperatures and longer reaction times. It is also more pronounced at higher steam pressures. Deactivation in the absence of steam, i.e., in an inert atmosphere, requires more severe conditions than steam deactivation. Recently it has been found that the use of water can be employed to improve certain zeolite catalyst characteristics, while maintaining catalyst activity levels. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,149,960 and 4,150,062 describe the use of about 0.5 to about 15 moles of water per mole of feedstock in order to substantially reduce the coking and aging rates of the zeolite catalysts used in the processes of these disclosures. U.S. Patent 3,493,519 teaches a method of using steam for the stabilization of Y faujasite zeolite. There, a chelating agent was used after steaming to take out the excess aluminum from the zeolite. The resultant catalyst of this process is a hydrothermally stable zeolite catalyst having high hydrocarbon conversion activity. In U.S. Patent 3,546,100, it is disclosed that a rare earth exchanged zeolite hydrocracking catalyst such as zeolites X or Y can be improved with respect to its cracking activity and selectivity by using water in controlled amounts to activate catalyst cracking sites. This disclosure states that the amount of water be maintained during the process such that the water vapor partial pressure is kept at a level of about 10 to about 130 mm water vapor. In accordance with the present invention, there has now been discovered a method for substantially increasing the acid catalytic activity of members of a unique class of zeolites by treatment with water, i.e. liquid water or steam under controlled conditions. Whereas under prior art methods the activity of a fresh acid zeolite monotonically decreases upon thermal treatment, under the controlled conditions of this invention, there is a considerable increase in activity over the initial activity. The members of the unique class of zeolites of the present invention are characterized by a silica of alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the approximate range of 1 to 12. Unlike other catalyst activation methods, water steam addition during the catalytic reaction is not a requirement, rather the catalyst is treated prior to use. The enhanced zeolite activity attainable by the use of the method of this invention is achieved only under carefully controlled conditions. These conditions depend on the interplay of several variables such as temperature, waterpartial pressure, treating time, nature of zeolites and nature of treating gas. There exists a zone of enhanced activity where zeolit activity is increased over initial activity. Under conditions that are too mild catalyst activation is not obtained. Alternatively, under too severe conditions, the catalyst will undergo deactivation. According to the invention the activity, alpha, of a catalyst comprising an acid zeolite of the aforesaid class and a matrix material comprising clay, silica and or a metal oxide is increased by a method which consists of contacting said catalyst with water vapour for a time, and at a temperature and water vapour partial pressure so related that Whereas under prior art methods ammonia is used to suppress catalyst activity, under the controlled water treating conditions of the present invention, ammonia addition yields even higher activities than with water treating alone. The drawing is a plot of relative activity for n hexane cracking versus water partial pressure in the calcination of HZSM 5 Al The catalyst used in the method described herein comprises a crystalline zeolite which is a member of a class of zeolites exhibiting some unusual properties. These zeolites induce profound transformation of aliphatic hydrocarbons to aromatic hydrocarbons in commercially desirable yields and are generally highly effective in conversion reactions involving aromatic hydrocarbons. Although they have unusually low alumina contents, i.e., high silica to alumina mole ratios, they are very active even when the silica to alumina mole ratio exceeds 30. The activity is surprising since catalytic activity is generally attributed to framework aluminum atoms and cations associated with these aluminum atoms. These zeolites retain their crystallinity for long periods in spite of the presence of steam at high temperature which induces irreversible collapse of the framework of other zeolites, e.g., of the X and A type. An important characteristic of the crystal structure of this class of zeolites is that it provides constrained access to, and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having a pore dimension greater than about 5 Angstroms and pore windows of about a size such as would be provided by 10 membered rings of silicon atoms interconnected by oxygen. It is to be understood, of course, that these rings are those formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline zeolite, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra. Briefly, the preferred type zeolites useful in this invention possess, in combination a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a structure providing constrained access to the intercrystalline free space. The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the zeolite crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. Although zeolites with a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 are useful, it is preferred to use zeolites having higher ratios of at least about 30. Such zeolites, after activation, acquire an intracrystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e., they exhibit hydrophobic properties. It is believed that this hydrophobic character is advantageous in the present invention. The type zeolites useful in this invention freely sorb normal hexane and have a pore dimension greater than about 5 Angstroms. In addition, the structure must provide constrained access to larger molecules. It is sometimes possible to judge from a known crystal structure whether such constrained access exists. For example, if the only pore windows in a crystal are formed by 8 membered rings of silicon. and aluminum atoms, then access by molecules of larger cross section than normal hexane is excluded and the zeolite is not of the desired type. Windows of 10 membered rings are preferred, although, in some instances, excessive puckering or pore blockage may render these zeolites ineffective. Twelve membered rings do not generally appear to offer sufficient constraint to produce the advantageous conversions, although puckered structures exist such as TMA offretite which is a known effective zeolite. Also, structures can be conceived, due to pore blockage or other cause, that may be operative. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access, a simple determination of the constraint index may be made by passing continuously a mixture of an equal weight of normal hexane and 3 methylpentane over a sample of zeolite at atmospheric pressure according to the following procedure. A sample of the zeolite, in the form of pellets or extrudate, is crushed to a particle size about that of coarse sand and mounted in a glass tube. Prior to testing, the zeolite is treated with a stream of air at 537 C 1000 F for at least 15 minutes. The zeolite is then flushed with helium and the temperature adjusted between 287 C 550 F and 510 C 950 F to give an overall conversion between 10 and 60 . The mixture of hydrocarbons is passed at a 1 liquid hourly space velocity i.e., 1 volume of liquid hydrocarbon per volume of zeolite per hour over the zeolite with a helium dilution to give a helium to total hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4 1. After 20 minutes on stream, a sample of the effluent is taken and analyzed, most conveniently by gas chromatography, to determine the fraction remaining unchanged for each of the two hydrocarbons. The constraint index is calculated as follows The constraint index approximates the ratio of the cracking rate constants for the two hydrocarbons. Zeolites suitable for the present invention are those having a constraint index in the approximate range of 1 to 12. Constraint Index CI values for some typical zeolites are It is to be realized that the above constraint index values typically characterize the specified zeolites but that such are the cumulative result of several variables used in determination and calculation thereof. Thus, for a given zeolite depending on the temperature employed within the aforenoted range of 287 C 550 F to 510 C 950 F , with accompanying conversion between 10 and 60 , the constraint index may vary within the indicated approximate range of 1 to 12. Likewise, other variables such as the crystal size of the zeolite, the presence of possible occluded contaminants and binders intimately combined with the zeolite may affect the constraint index. It will accordingly be understood by those skilled in the art that the constraint index, as utilized herein, while affording a highly useful means for characterizing the zeolites of interest is approximate, taking into consideration the manner of its determination with probability, in some instances, of compounding variable extremes. While the above experimental procedure will enable one to achieve the desired overall conversion of 10 to 60 for most catalyst samples and represents preferred conditions, it may occasionally be necessary to use somewhat more severe conditions for samples of very low activity, such as those having a very high silica to alumina mole ratio. In those instances, a temperature of up to about 537 C 1000 F and a liquid hourly space velocity of less than one, such as 0.1 or less, can be employed in order to achieve a minimum total conversion of about 10 . The class of zeolites defined herein is exemplified by ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35 and ZSM 38, defined respectively in US A 3,702,886, 3,709,979, 3,832,449, 4,076,842, 4,016,245 and 4,046,859. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are catalytically inactive, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 537 C 1000 F for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 537 C 1000 F in air. The presence of organic cation in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favour the formation of this special type catalyst by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at about 537 C 1000 F for from about 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to this type zeolite catalyst by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. The preferred crystalline zeolites are ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35 and ZSM 38, with ZSM 5 particularly preferred. In a preferred aspect of this invention, the zeolites hereof are selected as those having a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not substantially below about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. It has been found that zeolites which satisfy all three of these criteria are most desired. Therefore, the preferred zeolites of this invention are those having a constraint index, as defined above of about 1 to about 12 a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a dried crystal density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminium atoms per 100 cubic Angstroms, as given, e.g., on Page 19 of the article on Zeolite Structure by W. M. Meier. This paper is included in Proceedings of the Conference on Molecular Sieves, London, April 1967 , published by the Society of Chemical Industry, London, 1968. When the crystal structure is unknown, the crystal framework density may be determined by classical pykonmeter techniques. For example, it may be determined by immersing the dry hydrogen form of the zeolite in an organic solvent which is not sorbed by the crystal. It is possible that the unusual sustained activity and stability of this class of zeolites is associated with its high crystal anionic framework density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. This high density, of course, must be associated with a relative small amount of free space within the crystal, which might be expected to result in more stable structures. This free space, however, is important as the locus of catalytic activity . Crystal framework densities of some typical zeolites are When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form. In addition to the hydrogen form, other forms of the zeolite wherein the original alkali metal has been reduced to less than about 1.5 percent by weight may be used. Thus, the original alkali metal of the zeolite or introduced hydrogen cations may be replaced by ion exchange with other suitable ions of Groups IB to VIII of the Periodic Table, including, by way of example, nickel, cadmium, copper, zinc, palladium,calcium or rare earth metals. The above described crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite is incorporated in a matrix material resistant to the temperature and the other conditions employed in the process, namely clay, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Naturally occurring clays, which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in a raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolites employed herein may be composited with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica berylia, silica titania as well as ternary compositions, such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of zeolite component and inorganic oxide gel matrix may vary widely with the zeolite content ranging from between about 1 to about 99 percent by weight and more usually in the range of about 5 to about 80 percent by weight of the composite. The degree of zeolite catalyst activity for all acid catalyzed reactions can be measured and compared by means of alpha value α . The alpha value reflects the relative activity of the catalyst with respect to a high activity silica alumina cracking catalyst. To determine the alpha value as such term is used herein, n hexane conversion is determined at a suitable temperature between about 287 C 537 C 550 F 1000 F , preferably at 537 C 1000 F .Conversion is varied by variation in space velocity such that a conversion level of up to about 60 percent of n hexane is obtained and converted to a rate constant per unit volume of zeolite and compared with that of silica alumina catalyst which is normalized to a reference activity of 537 C 100 F . Catalytic activity of the catalysts are expressed as multiple of this standard, i.e. the silica alumina standard. The silica alumina reférence catalyst contains about 10 weight percent Al One measure of comparison used to relate catalyst activities is relative activity . Relative activity is the ratio of the activity of the catalyst after treatment over the initial activity. Thus relative activity can be expressed as follows The relative activity of a catalyst at the point of initial activity is therefore 1 since The relative activity of a catalyst at the point of maximum enhanced activity can be expressed as follows In order to increase the activity of members of this unique class of zeolites, said zeolites are treated with water, e.g. steam, or water, e.g. steam, produced in situ. Non limiting examples of water produced in situ include alcohol dehydration to produce olefins and steam and hydrocarbon or coke combustion in the presence of oxygen to form carbon oxides and steam. During treatment, the zeolite should be at least partially in the acidic form, e.g. hydrogen form. Suitable zeolitic forms also include those that are at least partially convertible to the hydrogen form under treatment conditions, e.g. the ammonium form, or alkyl ammonium form. There exists a narrow range or band of conditions in which zeolite catalyst activity can be enhanced over the initial activity value. Deviations from this band of conditions can result in either non enhancement of activity too mild conditions , or alternatively, catalyst deactivation too severe conditions . Such conditions include temperature, water partial pressure, treating time, nature of the zeolite, and the nature of the treating gas. This range of conditions can be clearly demonstrated by a plot of relative activity versus a particular variable, e.g. water partial pressure, treating time, etc., with the other conditions being held constant. Such a plot is given by the drawing in which relative activity is plotted against water partial pressure with temperature and treating time being held constant. With increasing water partial pressure, activity is continuously enhanced above initial relative activity until a point of maximum enhanced relative activity is attained Once maximum enhanced relative activity is achieved, the activity begins to decrease with increasing water partial pressure, ultimately back.to the same activity as the initial relative activity same activity as the untreated zeolite, i.e. initial activity . Increasing water partial pressure after this return to initial activity will eventually result in catalyst deactivation too severe conditions . Catalyst activation occurs in a limited region of conditions which can be defined as a zone of enhanced activity . This zone encompasses those conditions which yield activities greater than the initial activity α and the return to initial relative activity The zone of enhanced activity embraces all conditions and combinations thereof yielding activities greater than the initial catalyst activity. One such activity in this zone is the maximum activity. An expression to approximately define this band in relation to two specific variables treating time and water partial pressure, with temperature held constant is as follows where In regard to the condition of zeolite nature, two particular factors can be evaluated. One factor is the specific zeolite employed, such as ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, etc. Another factor is the crystal size of the particular zeolite employed. For the purposes of this disclosure, small crystal size zeolites are those generally of 0.02 to 0.05 micrometres and large crystal size zeolites are those of generally 0.1 micrometres and greater. The extent of the zone of enhanced activity can be modified by adjustments in the controlled conditions of treating time, temperature and water partial pressure. The interdependence of these variables controlled conditions are such that, for example, an increase in water partial pressure, at constant temperature, will lessen the required treating time to attain a certain activity enhancement. Likewise, increasing the temperature, at constant water partial pressure also lessens the required treating time to attain a specific activity enhancement. The nature of the treating gas is another influential factor in catalyst activity enhancement. The treating gas in all cases contains either steam or steam producing compounds and mixtures. However, when ammonia is a constituent of the treating gas, even greater zeolite maximum activities than those attainable by steam alone can be achieved. Also the zone of enhanced activity is extended. The preferred range for ammonia addition is from about 0.01 to about 10 mole ratio ammonia steam and more preferably from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mole ratio ammonia steam. Zeolites activated in accordance with the present invention are generally useful as catalysts in acid catalyzed hydrocarbon conversion processes over a range of conversion conditions. Such conditions include a reaction temperature of from about 35 C 95 F to about 648 C 1200 F , preferably from about 199 C 390 F to about 537 C 1000 F , a reaction pressure of from atmospheric to about 69,049 kPa 10,000 psig , preferably from about atmospheric to about 24,233 kPa 3,500 psig , and a hydrogen hydrocarbon compound mole ratio of from 0 to about 20, preferably from 0 to about 10. When the conversion is conducted in a flow apparatus, e.g. a down flow reactor, or under conditions comparable to those existing in a flow apparatus, the weight hourly space velocity WHSV should be maintained at between about 0.1 hr ¹ and about 1000 hr ¹, preferably between about 0.5 hr ¹ and about 10 hr ¹. When the conversion is conducted in a batch apparatus, e.g. a stirred batch reactor, or under conditions comparable to those existing in a batch apparatus, the contact time should be maintained at between about 0.01 hour and about 48 hours, preferably between about 0.1 hour and about 24 hours. The subject catalysts have extremely high cracking activity and may be used to convert materials such as gas oils, fuel petroleum crudes, paraffins, olefins and the like from high to low molecular weight substances. The activated catalysts produced by the instant invention may also be used in hydrocracking, alkylation, dealkylation, transalkylation, isomerization, dimerization, oligomerization, polymerization, addition, disproportionation, aromatization, hydration and many other acid catalyzed reactions. A typical alkylation reaction involves the use of aromatics and olefins to synthesize such materials as ethylbenzene, ethyltoluene, or cumene. Another alkylation reaction involves the use of aromatics and paraffins. A typical transalkylation reaction involves reacting benzene and methyl naphthalene to form toluene and naphthalene. Another transalkylation reaction is the conversion of toluene and trimethylbenzene to xylenes. Typical disproportionation reactions include the conversion of toluene to benzene and xylenes or the conversion of methylnaphthalene to naphthalene and dimethyl naphthalenes. Isomerization reactions may be carried out with diverse feedstocks such as paraffins, olefins or alkyl aromatics, e.g. xylenes. In particular, when the conversion of hydrocarbon compounds by the present method is olefin polymerization, catalytic conversion conditions should be maintained within certain ranges, including a temperature of from about 35 C 95 F to about 501 C 935 F , preferably from about 199 C 390 F to about 432 C 810 F , a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 64,049 kPa 10,000 psig , preferably from about atmospheric to about 12,891 kPa 2,000 psig , a WHSV when a flow operation of from about 0.1 hr ¹ to about 1000 hr ¹, preferably from about 0.5 hr ¹ to about 100 hr ¹, and a contact time when a batch operation of from about 0.1 hour to about 48 hours, preferably from about 0.5 hour to about 24 hours and a hydrogen hydrocarbon i.e. olefin mole ratio of from about 0 to about 20, preferably from about 0 to about 10. When the conversion is olefin or paraffin aromatization, catalytic conversion conditions should be maintained within certain ranges, including a temperature, of from about 287 C 550 F to about 648 C 1200 F , preferably from about 343 C 650 F to about 593 C 1100 F ,a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 64,049 kPa 10,000 psig , preferably from about atmospheric to about 12,891 kPa 2000 psig , a WHSV when a flow operation of from about 0.1 hr ¹ to about 10 hr ¹, preferably from about 1 hr ¹ to about 5 hr ¹, a contact time when a batch operation of from about 0.1 hour to about 48 hours, preferably from about 1 hour to about 24 hours and a hydrogen hydrocarbon, i.e. olefin or paraffin, mole ratio of from about 0 to about 20, preferably from about 0 to about 10. Further, when the conversion of hydrocarbon compounds by the present process is cracking, catalytic conversion conditions should be maintained within certain ranges, including a temperature of from about 371 C 700 F to about 648 C 1200 F , preferably from about 427 C 800 F to about 593 C 1100 F , a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 1480 kPa 200 psig , a WHSV when a flow operation of from about 0.5 hr ¹ to about 50 hr ¹, preferably from about 1 hr ¹ to about 10 hr ¹, and a contact time when a batch operation of from about 0.01 hour to about 24 hours, preferably from about 0.1 hour to about 10 hours. When the conversion is hydrocracking, catalytic conversion conditions should be maintained within somewhat different ranges, including a temperature of from about 204 C 400 F to about 537 C 1000 F , preferably from about 260 C 500 F to about 454 C 850 F , a pressure of from about 3,548 kPa 500 psig to about 24,233 kPa 3500 psig , a WHSV when a flow operation of from about 0. 1 hr ¹ to about 10 hr ¹, preferably from about 0.2 hr ¹ to about 5 hr ¹, a contact time when a batch operation of from about 0.1 hour to about 10 hours, preferably from about 0.2 hour to about 5 hours, and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 1 to about 20 preferably from about 3 to about 10. When the conversion of hydrocarbon compounds by the instant process is isomerization, conversion conditions include a temperature of between about 450 F and about 537 C 1000 F , a pressure of between about 101 kPa 0 psig and about 3,458 kPa 500 psig , a WHSV of between about 0.1 and 200 hr ¹, and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of between about 0.1 and about 10. When the conversion is alkylation or transalkylation by the present process, conversion conditions include a temperature of between about 37 C 100 F and about 510 C 950 F for alkylation and a temperature of between about 343 C 650 F and about 593 C 1100 F for transalkylation, a pressure of between about 101 kPa 0 psig and about 69,049 kPa 1000 psig for both alkylation and transalkylation, and a WHSV of between about 1 and about 500 for alkylation and of between about 1 and 20 for transalkylation. When the conversion is disproportionation by the instant process, conversion conditions include a temperature of between about 343 C 650 F and about 593 C 1100 F , a pressure of between about 101 kPa 0 psig and about 1000 psig , a WHSV of between about 1 and about 20 and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of between about 0 and about 4. The carrying out of the activity enhancement method of this invention can be accomplished concomitant with zeolite manufacture. Alternatively, a conventionally treated catalyst can be utilized in a particular process with enhancement being brought about later, such as in subsequent cycles, or between cycles. The following examples will serve to illustrate the process of the present invention without unduly limiting same. Unless otherwise specified all parts are by weight. A small crystal size ZSM 5 with a crystal size of about 0.02 to 0.05 micrometres was prepared as follows A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 16.7 parts water and 28.6 parts sodium silicate 28.7 wt. SiO An acid solution was prepared by adding 1 part aluminium sulfate 17.2 wt. Al The silicate solution and the acid solution were mixed in an agitated vessel while 2.0 parts of NaCl and 0.8 parts water were added to form a gel. An organic solution was prepared by adding 1.9 parts tri n propylamine, 1.7 parts n propyl bromide and 3.2 parts methyl ethyl ketone. The organic solution was added to the gel and the mixture was reacted at about 104 C 220 F without agitation and held there for 14 15 hours to prereact the organics. At the end of the prereaction period the agitation was commenced to start the initial crystallization period. After about 75 80 hours the temperature was raised to 160 C 320 F and held there for about three hours to complete crystallization. The excess or unreacted organics were flashed off and the remaining contents were cooled and discharged. The zeolite was then washed and dried. The product was identified as ZSM 5 with a sodium level of about 0.01 wt. and having a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 70. After drying, the zeolite was mixed with alpha alumina monohydrate and water to an extrudable consistency and formed into 0.158 cm 1 16 extrudates. The extrudates were dried, calcined in flowing N A 50 cc sample of ammonium ZSM 5 prepared according to the procedure of Example 1 and containing Al As can be seen from Table 1 and the drawing, there is a continuous increase in cracking activity with increasing steam pressure until a maximum activity is attained at 7,332 Pa 55 torr steam. This maximum activity represents about a four fold increase over the starting material. After this maximum activity is achieved, activities decrease with increasing steam pressure, but still remain higher than the starting material up to 19,865 Pa 149 torr steam. Another sample of small crystal ZSM 5 such as that prepared according to Example 1, was treated at 399 C 750 F for 23 hours in one atmosphere steam. The hexane cracking activity of the sample, determined at 537 C 1000 F , was increased from an initial activity of α A large crystal size ZSM 5 with a crystal size of about 1 5 micrometres was prepared as follows A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 16 parts water and 27.7 parts sodium silicate 28.7 Wt. SiO An acid solution was prepared by adding 1 part aluminium sulfate 17.2 wt. Al These solutions were mixed in an agitated vessel while 3.9 parts of NaCl were added. The gel molar ratios expressed as oxides are the following An organic solution was prepared by adding 1.6 parts n propyl bromide and 3.1 parts methylethyl ketone to 1.9 parts tri n propylamine and added to the gel. The mixture was reacted to 65 71 C 150 160 F with severe agitation for 29 hours. The zeolite slurry product was diluted with 4 5 parts water per part slurry and 0.0002 parts of flocculent Rohm Haas Primafloc C 7, a trade name per part slurry, allowed to settle and supernatant liquid was drawn off. The settled solids were reslurried to the original volume of the preceding step with water and 0.00005 parts of flocculent per part slurry. After settling, the aqueous phase was decanted. This procedure was repeated until the decant supernatant liquid was Cl The dried zeolite product was calcined in flowing N Large crystal size ZSM 5 prepared according to Example 4 and used in its hydrogen form was treated at three different temperatures, all in 101 kPa one atmosphere steam for various amounts of time. Example 5 was conducted at 399 C 750 F Example 6 was conducted at 427 C 800 F and Example 7 was conducted at 537 C 1000 F . Relative activities measured at 537 C 1000 F in terms of alpha values were evaluated for all the time intervals in all three examples. The results for these examples are given in Table 2. In comparing the results of Examples 5, 6 and 7 against each other, the effect of temperature can be evaluated. In increasing the temperature, the time required to reach the maximum relative activity is decreased. At 399 C 750 F , the maximum relative activity is achieved after 23 hours, while at 427 C 800 F , the maximum relative activity is attained after 8 hours. At 537 C 1000 F , only 2 hours is required to attain the maximum relative activity. Consequently, when temperature is increased, the duration of catalyst activation is decreased. At 399 C 750 F , the duration of catalyst activation is between 70 hours and 170 hours, while at 537 C 1000 F , the duration of catalyst activation is only 3.2 hours. The duration of catalyst activation is defined as the amount of treating time required for the catalyst activity to return to its initial value to a value of relative of activity 1 . ZSM 5 with a crystal size of about 0.1 0.5 micrometres was prepared as follows A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 16 parts water and 27.7 parts sodium silicate 28.7 Wt. SiO An acid solution was prepared by adding 1 part aluminum sulfate 17.2 wt. Al These solutions were mixed in an agitated vessel while 3.9 parts of NaCl were added. The gel molar ratios expressed as oxides are the following An organic solution was prepared by adding 1.6 parts n propyl bromide and 3.1 parts methyl ethyl ketone to 1.9 parts tri n propylamine. After the gel was heated to about 95 C, agitation was reduced and the organic solution was added above the gel. This mixture was held at about 95 110 C for 14 hours, then agitation increased and the temperature was increased to about 150 160 C and held there until crystallization was complete. Unreacted organics were removed by flashing and the remaining contents cooled. The zeolite slurry product was diluted with 4 5 parts water per part slurry, allowed to settle and supernatant liquid was drawn off. The settled solids were reslurried to the original volume of the preceding step with water. After settling, the aqueous phase was decanted. This procedure was repeated until the sodium level of the zeolite was less than 1.0 wt. . The washed zeolite was then filtered, dried and identified as ZSM 5 having a silica alumina mole ratio of at least 12 i.e., about 70, and a constraint index of between 1 and 12 i.e., about 8.3. The intermediate size zeolite ZSM 5 prepared according to the procedure of Example 8 and used in its hydrogen form was heated at a rate of 20 C per minute in a stream of dry helium. This zeolite had an initial activity in terms of alpha value of 211. In Example 9, the HZSM 5 has heated to 760 C 1400 F and held for 2 hours at that temperature. in Example 10, the HZSM 5 was heated to 982 C 1800 F and then rapidly cooled. After treatments according to Example 9 and Example 10, the activities of the zeolite in terms of alpha value were determined. The results for these examples is shown in Table 3. HZSM 11 was prepared according to the procedure given in Example 6, Table II of U.S. Patent 4,108,881 and was converted to NH Three grams of the HZSM 11 was air calcined for 10 hours in a muffle furnace. It was then exchanged twice, at room temperature, with stirring, with 200 ml of 0.5N NH The NH Another NH A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 14.4 parts sodium silicate 28.7 Wt. SiO An acid solution was prepared by mixing 1 part aluminum sulfate 17.2 wt. Al The silicate solution and acid solution were combined in a mixing nozzle and the resulting gel discharged into an agitated vessel to which 0.4 parts of water had been added. The gel was thoroughly mixed at ambient temperature and 0.6 parts of sodium chloride was added to the mixture. Finally, a solution containing 1.4 parts of tetrabutylammonium bromide and 2.1 parts water was added to the mixture. The temperature of the gel mixture was raised to 104 C 220 F with severe agitation and held for 256 hours until crystallization was complete. The crystallized product was cooled, filtered, washed free of soluble salts and dried. The dried product was analyzed by X ray diffraction and identified as ZSM 11. The NH Zeolite ZSM 12 was prepared according to the following procedure A reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 65 parts of Hi Sil a trade name a precipitated SiO The crystallized product was washed and dried and then identified as 90 ZSM 12 by X ray diffraction with the following chemical analysis The washed and dried zeolite was calcined in flowing N A sample of HZSM 12 prepared according to the general procedure of Example 15 was heated in flowing steam of 1 atmosphere pressure at 454 C 850 F for various amounts of time. The results for this example are illustrated in Table 4. A sample of HZSM 5 prepared according to the general procedure of Example 4 was steam activated for 10 hours at 537 C 1000 F in a closed container. Toluene at a rate of 10 WHSV and 101 kPa 1 atmosphere pressure was passed over both the treated and untreated HZSM 5 catalyst at 482 C 900 F in a vertical flow reactor. Toluene was disproportionated to benzene, xylenes and small amounts of trimethyl benzenes. The results of Example 17 are exhibited in Table 5. In these examples small crystal HZSM 5 with an initial hexane cracking activity of 191 prepared according to the general procedure of Example 1 was utilized. The zeolite in each example was treated with a flowing stream of a particular gas at 537 C 1000 F . Results for these examples are given in Table 6. The experimental procedure and catalyst used in this example were the same as described in Example 2, except that in this example an inert gas stream containing about 3 14 vol. ammonia was utilized along with the specified partial pressure amounts of steam. After each treatment, the sample was heated in a dry nitrogen stream to 537 C 1000 F to remove adsorbed water and ammonia and the relative activity for cracking hexane was determined at 399 C 750 F . The results for Example 20 are given in Table 7. While either steam treatment or ammonia treatment alone produce a catalyst with enhanced activity under mild conditions, the simultaneous presence of steam and ammonia has an unexpected additional synergistic effective above that of the individual gases, as shown in Example 20. As can be seen by a comparison with Example 2, the synergistic action of both steam and ammonia produce catalysts with even greater activity than by steam treatment alone. In Example 2 where only steam is used, the maximum relative activity is 3.8, whereas in this example where ammonia is added to the steam, the maximum relative activity is 8.8. In addition, the range of treating conditions that give enhanced activities, rather than deactivation is increased. For example, under the conditions of time and temperature of Example 2, the range of beneficial steam pressures is increased from 666 Pa to 19,865 Pa 5 to 149 torr for steam to a range of 666 Pa to about 93324 Pa 5 to about 700 torr steam by the addition of small concentrations of ammonia.
