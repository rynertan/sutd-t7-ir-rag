## Description
AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR CEPHALOSPORIN INTERMEDIATES This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an intermediate for semi synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics. In particular, it relates to an improved process for preparing 7 amino 3 l pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate, hereinafter referred to as 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus, an intermediate for antibiotics, e.g. ceftazidime and cephaloridine. Ceftazidime, 6R,7R 7ss Z 2 2 amino thiazol 4 yl 2 2 carboxyprop 2 yloxyimino acetamido 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate, is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,258,041. One method for the preparation of ceftazidime comprises the N acylation of the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus represented byFormula I EMI1.1 The 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus has been obtained as the crystalline dihydrochloride dihydrate by the method described in U.S. Patent No. 4,369,313. Crystalline 7 amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid dihydrochloride dihydrate may be obtained in high yields directly from the reaction mixture in which it is formed. The 3 pyridinium 3cephem nucleus 2HCl 2H2O is formed by the cleavage of a 7 substituted amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate. For example, a 7 acylamino group isN deacylated to provide the nucleus. The N deacylation is accomplished by forming the imino chloride of the 7 position acylamino group and converting the imino chloride to the corresponding imino ether. The labile imino ether decomposes to the 7 amino nucleus compound.In a special case the N formyl group of 7ss formamido 3 l pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate is hydrolyzed in methanolic hydrochloric acid to provide the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus. The 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus, formed in the cleavage reaction mixture, is obtained as the dihydrochloride dihydrate in crystalline form when the reaction mixture is diluted with acetonitrile containing about 5 to about 10 water or acetone containing about 5 to about 10 water, or isopropyl alcohol containing about 5 to about 10 water by volume. These ranges can be varied by 1 or 2 as indicated by the word about . According to the process of this invention, crystalline 7 amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid dihydrochloride dihydrate is obtained directly from the crude reaction mixture in which it is formed by mixing the reaction mixture at a temperature of between about 0 C. and about 350C. with a solvent system selected from acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol or acetone, each containing between about 5 to 10 water by volume. In particular, there is provided a process for preparing 7 amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate dihydrochloride from the cleavage of a 7 substituted amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem4 carboxylate characterized by mixing the cleavage reaction mixture containing the said 7 amino cleavage product with a solvent selected from acetonitrile, acetone or isopropyl alcohol, said solvent and or reaction mixture in total containing from between about 5 and about 10 by volume of water relative to said solvent volume and separating the 7 amino 3 1pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate produced as the crystalline dihydrochloride dihydrate. The 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus can be obtained by differing preparative routes. In general, a 7 substituted amino 3 pyridinium 3 cephem 4 carboxylate is prepared by known methods such as nucleophilic displacement of a 7 substituted amino 3 acetoxymethylor 3 halomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid or ester with pyridine. The 7 substituent group then is cleaved from the product to provide the 7 amino nucleus. The 7substituted amino group may be a mono or diacylated amino group, e.g. 2 thienylacetylamino, phenylacetylamino, phenoxyacetylamino, formylamino, phthalimido, succinimido, and like mono and diacylated amino groups.The 7 substituted amino group also may be the amino group protected by a conventional amino protecting group such as alkoxycarbonyl, cycloalkoxycarbonyl, bicyclicalkoxy carbonyl, or aralkoxycarbonyl group such as t butyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, and the like a silylated amino group such as a trialkylsilyl group or the trityl group. Following the formation of the 3 pyridinium 7 substituted amino 3 cephem compound, the 7 substituent group is removed to provide the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus. A 7 acylamino group of a 7 acylamino 3 pyridinium compound is deacylated via the well knownN deacylation method comprising the formation of an imino chloride.In this method the acylamino portion of the 7 acylamino 3 pyridinium compound is converted to the imino chloride with phosphorus pentachloride, and the latter is converted to the corresponding imino ether upon reaction with a lower alkanol, alkanediol, or benzyl alcohol. The imino ether is then decomposed to provide the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus. In an example of the overall process for preparing the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus, 7 2 thienylacetylamino cephalosporanic acid is reacted with pyridine at about 600C. in aqueous acetone to provide 7 2 thienylacetylamino 3 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate, also known as cephaloridine. The 3 pyridinium product is N deacylated as follows. The compound is converted to the trimethylsilyl derivative in methylene chloride with trimethylchlorosilane in the presence of an acid binding agent such as a dialkylaniline, and the derivative is reacted with phosphorus pentachloride at about 25 C. to 10 C. to form the imino chloride derivative.Next, the imino chloride is converted to the imino ether by addition of an alkanol or alkandiol, and the unstable imino ether decomposes to form the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus. In an alternative preparative method, 7 2 thienyl acetylamino cephalosporanic acid is reacted with excess trimethylsilyl iodide to form the 3 iodomethyl derivative as the trimethylsilyl ester according to the method of Bonjouklian, U.S. Patent No. 4,266,049. The 3 iodomethyl derivative is reacted with pyridine to provide the pyridiniummethyl trimethylsilyl ester, and the latter is N deacylated by the procedure described hereinabove to form the 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus compound. The 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus can be prepared by the methods described above with 7 acylaminocephalosporanic acids or 3 derivatives thereof other than the 2 thienylacetylaminocephalosporanic acid or derivatives thereof. For example, the 7 acyl group can be phenylacetyl, phenoxyacetyl or an alkanoyl group. One such alkanoyl group which can be used as a preferred starting material is 7 formamidocephalosporanic acid N formyl 7 ACA . In practicing an embodiment of the process of this invention, N formyl 7 ACA is reacted with excess trimethylsilyl iodide to form 7 formamido 3 iodomethyl3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid trimethylsilyl ester.Without isolation, the 3 iodomethyl ester is reacted with pyridine to form the 7 formamido 3 pyridiniummethyl derivative. The latter then is hydrolyzed with a methanol solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid to provide in solution 7 amino 3 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem4 carboxylic acid dihydrochloride. The reaction mixture is then diluted with acetonitrile, acetone, or isopropyl alcohol in an amount corresponding to between about one third and about one half of the volume of the reaction mixture. The water already present in the reaction mixture by virtue of the acid hydrolysis of theN formyl group is sufficient to provide the amount of water to form the desired ratio of water to the diluting organic solvent of about 5 to about 10 .Accordingly, the organic solvent need not be diluted with water to the desired percentage in the instance where sufficient water is already present in the reaction mixture. In the case in which the N deacylation is carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions, e.g. N deacylation via imino halide and imino ether formation, the reaction mixture is diluted with the aqueous organic solvent containing the desired ratio of water to solvent. In an example of the process under the latter conditions, 7 2 thienylacetylamino 3 l pyridinium methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate is first silylated in methylene chloride with trimethylchlorosilane in the presence of a suitable base, e.g. a dialkylaniline. The silylated derivative is next reacted with phosphorus pentachloride at about 200C. to about 250C. to form the imino chloride and the latter is converted to the imino ether with methyl alcohol. After stirring the imino ether at room temperature to effect its decomposition to the pyridinium nucleus compound, the whole reaction mixture is poured into acetonitrile containing between 5 and 10 water. The pyridinium nucleus dihydrochloride dihydrate crystallizes from the diluted reaction mixture and is collected by filtration, decantation, centrifugation, or other suitable means. In a further example of the process of this invention, 7 aminocephalosporanic acid is mixed in methylene chloride at a temperature between about OOC. and about 50C. with excess trimethylsilyl iodide in the presence of a dialkylaniline such as N,N diethylaniline.The disilylated 3 iodomethyl derivative, 7 trimethylsilylamino 3 iodomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid trimethylsilyl ester, formed in solution is treated with pyridine at a temperature about 150C. to form the soluble disilylated 3 pyridinium nucleus. The disilylated 3 pyridinium nucleus is hydrolyzed by adding the reaction to a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and methyl alcohol while maintaining the temperature of the hydrolysis mixture below about 250C.After hydrolysis is complete, acetonitrile is then added with stirring to the hydrolysis mixture. The 7 amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate dihydrochloride dihydrate crystallizes from the mixture and is collected by filtration or centrifugation. The crystalline product is dried at a temperature of about 400C. According to the invention, the 3 pyridinium3 cephem nucleus is isolated as the crystalline dihydrochloride dihydrate directly from the reaction mixture in which it is formed by the addition of a solvent system of the invention. The preferred solvent system is acetonitrile containing about 5 to about 10 water.The mode of addition is not critical however, better crystallization often results when the 3 pyridinium3 cephem nucleus containing reaction mixture is added to the aqueous solvent system. The reaction mixture is diluted by using a volume of the aqueous solvent system corresponding to from about h to about h of the volume of the reaction mixture. The practice of this invention results in the direct recovery of crystalline product from the reaction mixture and, therefore, is especially economical for manufacturing purposes. More expensive recovery and crystallization procedures such as extraction, column chromatography, and recrystallization, therefore, can be avoided. The aqueous solvent systems provided are also applicable to the purification of impure 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus 2HCl and such use forms a further aspect of this invention. According to this aspect, non crystalline 3l pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus 2HCl or impure nucleus 2HCl 2H2O is suspended in the organic solvent water system of this invention and the suspension is treated with stirring with concentrated hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride. The amount of acid added is between about 0.05 mole and about 0.1 mole per mole of 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus dihydrochloride salt. The recrystallization is carried out at a temperature between about 50C. and about 250C.Preferably, the recrystallization is carried out in acetonitrile containing 5 to 10 water. The crystalline disalt dihydrate generally crystallizes a few minutes after acidification. The following non limiting Examples are provided to further illustrate the process of the invention. Example 1 To a 500 ml, three necked flask were added 28.5 g of 7P 2 thienylacetylamino 3 l pyridinium methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate, 200 ml of methylene chloride, 35 ml of N,N dimethylaniline, and 20 ml of trimethylchlorosilane.

The reaction mixture acetonitrile mixture was evaporated under vacuum at a still temperature of 200C. to 360C. to reduce the volume by collecting 250 1 of distillate. The still was then cooled with brine overnight and the crystalline 3 pyridinium 3 cephem nucleus was collected by filtration.The nucleus was washed with 35 1 of acetonitrile containing 1.75 1 of water. The product was dried for eight days in an air oven at 350C. There were obtained 15.06 kg 66.6 yield of the crystalline 3 pyridinium3 cephem nucleus dihydrochloride dihydrate. Example 3 To 120 1 of methylene chloride contained in a nitrogen purged reactor were added 35 kg of 7ss formamido 3 acetoxymethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid and 11.76 kg of hexamethyldisilazane and the mixture heated to the reflux temperature for three hours. The solution pH 7 obtained was cooled to 250C. and added to a cold 50C. solution of trimethylsilyl iodide in methylene chloride prepared in the following manner. To 60 1 of methylene chloride were added 19.25 kg of iodine and 11.06 kg of hexamethyldisilazane and the mixture was heated at the reflux temperature for 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled to 50C. for use in the reaction. The reaction mixture was stirred for 70 minutes at 230C. to form in situ trimethylsilyl 7ss formamido 3 iodomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate.
