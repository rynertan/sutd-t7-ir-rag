# A thin film field effect transistor and a process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A thin film transistor according to the invention com prises a glass substrate a gate electrode which is formed on the glass substrate a source electrode a drain electrode an insulating film which covers at least said gate electrode and, an amorphous semiconductor layer which is formed on said insulating film, and which comprises a first portion having said source electrode thereon, a second portion having said drain electrode thereon, and a third portion which is between the first and second portions, is located above the gate elec trode, and klwhich is thin thickness capable of permeating light of photo lithography therethrough.
