## Description
DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING POLYACETAL CARBOXYLATE DETERGENCY BUILDERS Technical Field This invention relates to detergent compositions containing polyacetal carboxylate detergency builder materials and which provide a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.5 in aqueous washing solutions. These compositions deliver excellent soil removal performance relative to detergent compositions containing other types of polycarboxylate and polyphosphate detergency builder materials at said pH. Background Art The property possessed by some materials for improving detergency of surface active agents such as soaps and synthetic detergents and the use of such materials in detergent compositions is known. Such cleaning boosters have been called detergency builders and such builders permit the attainment of better cleaning performance than is possible when so called unbuilt compositions are used. The mechanisms by which builders perform their function are only partially understood. tt is known that good builders must be able to effectively remove the alkaline earth metal ions, particularly calcium ions, from the wash water by precipitation or sequestration since these ions can be detrimental to the detergency process. The provision of reserve alkalinity has also been considered an important function of detergency builders.However, it is difficult to predict which compounds possess detergency builder properties under a specific set of conditions and which compounds do not. This is due to the complex nature of detergency and the countless factors which contribute to overall results. Sodium tripolyphosphate STP has been found to be a highly efficient detergency builder and this compound has been widely used for decades in detergent formulations However, because of the recent emphasis on removing phosphates from detergent compositions for environmental reasons, the detergent industry has been looking for materials suitable for use as detergency builders which do not contain phosphorus, and which are environmentally acceptable from other standpoints such as biodegradability. It has been difficult, however, to simultaneously deliver effective cleaning performance and biodegradability from materials that contain no phosphorus. Inorganic builders other than polyphosphates, e.g., carbonates and silicates, are generally less satisfactory for use as builders in detergent formulations. At least one type of organic polycarboxylate, specifically a water soluble nitrilotriacetate INTRA such as sodium nitrilotri acetate, has proven very satisfactory from the standpoints of effectiveness as a detergency builder and biodegradabi3ty. Use of water soluble polyphosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphate and polycarboxylates such as the nitrilotriacetates in detergent compositions tend to provide their water solution with an alkaline pH in the range of 8.5 to 11. It has been generally recognized that optimum fabric detergency for a wide range of fabrics and soils is obtained at pH values above about 9. Alkalinity in itself can have some value in the detergency process, but it also can substantially affect detergency builder performance. For some fabric washing operations, use of detergent compositions that provide a neutral or less alkaline washing solution than pH 9 is necessary or highly recommended. This includes the washing of fine fabrics, such as wool and silk and of fabrics having dyes or finishes not stable at alkaline pH values.Detergent compositions in which the active ingredients from a detergency standpoint are limited to surface active agents sur factants are typically employed in such applications. It should be recognized that soaps, i.e., the water soluble salts of fatty acids, generally provide alkaline pH values in water solution. A reduction in the pH value of a soap solution by means of addition of acidic material can cause precipitation of fatty acids and consequent loss of surface activity. It is an object of this invention to provide detergent compositions that contain effective detergency builders yet provide washing solution pH values of from about 6.0 to about 8.5.

In one embodiment of the present invention, the detergent surfactant is selected from the group consisting of cationic and non ionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof, particularly those described in U,S. published Patent Applications 4,222,905, Cockrell, filed June 26, 1978 4,259,217, plhwphy, filed June 26, 1978 and European Patent Application 0 004 121, Elurphy, Dublisid September 19, 1979 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the surfactant comprises at least about 30 anionic surfactant by weight of total surfactant and any cationic surfactant does not comprise compounds with more than a single C1218 alkyl group. Polyacetal Carboxylate The detergent compositions herein contain from about 58 to about 70 , preferably from about 10 to about 50 , by weight of a stabilized water soluble polymer comprising polyacetal carboxylate segments having the structureEMI14.1 wherein M is selected from the group consisting of alkali metal, ammonium, tetraalkyl, ammonium and alkanol amine groups having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl and alkanol chains n averages at least 4 and the total number of polyacetal carboxylate segments comprise at least 50 by weight of the total polymer. The polyacetal carboxylates for use herein are more fully described in U.S. Patent 4,146,495 of Crutchfield et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a surfactant. For the purposes of this invention, the term rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution shall mean that in an aqueous solution of 0.5 molar sodium hydroxide containing 10 grams per liter of polyacetal carboxylate, the average chain length of the polyacetal carboxylate will be reduced by more than 50 , as determined by Proton Magnetic Resonance, after t hour at 200C. Any number of esters of glyoxylic acid can be used to prepare the polyacetal carboxylates of the present invention.Such esters can be made by the reaction of an alcohol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms with glyoxylic acid hydrate under conditions known to those skilled in the art. Thereafter, the ester hemiacetal can be converted to the corresponding aldehyde ester by any number of techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as the reaction of the ester hemiacetal with phosphorus pentoxide.The product of the above reaction is then polymerized by techniques known to those skilled in the art using an initiator in accordance with the following general equation EMI15.1 tb HC SEP SEP 0 SEP CHO SEP n tb SEP I SEP I tb SEP C SEP SEP O SEP Ini SEP tiator SEP C SEP SEP 0 tb SEP OR SEP OR tb The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then reacted at its termini with a reagent which produces a chemically stable end group to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization. The stabilized polyacetal carboxylate is then reacted with a base, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, alkanolammonium hydroxide, and the like to make the polyacetal carboxylate salt suitable for use as a builder and as a sequestrant. The glyoxylic acid can be converted to the ester by reaction with any number of alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and the like. It is only necessary that the ester group does not interfere with the subsequent polymerization. Methanol is preferred. Any number of initiators can be used for the polymerization.Nonionic or ionic initiators provide satisfactory results. Suitable initiators include 2 hydroxypyridine H2O complex triethyl amine ethylvinyl ether trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. Even traces of hydroxy ion or cyanide ion will trigger the polymerization under nonaqueous conditions. Compounds such as diethylsodiomalonate or sodiomethylmalonate esters have been used with good results. Any number of chemically reactive groups can be added to the polyacetal carboxylate termini to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization. The specific nature of the chemically reactive group is not important in the proper function of the polyacetal carboxylate in its intended use.As an example, suitable chemically stable end groups include stable substituent moieties derived from otherwise stable compounds, such as alkanes, such as decane, dodecane, octadecane and the like alkenes such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, decene, dodecene and the like branched chain hydrocarbons, both saturated and unsaturated, such as 2 methyl butane, 2 methyl butene, 4 butyl 2,3 dimethyl octane and the like aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and the like cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes such as cyclohexane and cyclohexene and the like haloalkanes such as chlorobutane, dichloropentane and the like alcohols such as methanol, ethanol 2 propanol, cyclohexanol and the like polyhydric alcohols such as 1,2 ethane diol, 1,4 benzene diol and the like mercaptans such as methane thiol, 7,2 ethane dithiol and the like ethers such as methoxyethane methyl ether, ethyl ether, ethoxypropane and cyclic ethers such as ethylene oxide, epichlorohydrin, tetramethylene oxide and the like aldehydes and ketones such as ethanol, acetone, propanal, methylethyl ketone and the like and carboxylate containing compounds such as the alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids, the esters of carboxylic acids and the anhydrides.The above listing is intended to be instructive and is not intended to be limited since chemically stable end groups that stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization include nitrilo groups and halides such as chlorides, bromides and the like,Particularly suitable end groups include alkyl groups and cyclic alkyl groups containing oxygen such as oxyalkyl groups like methoxy, ethoxy and the like carboxylic acids such as CH2COOM, EMI17.1 and the like aldehydes, ethers and other oxygen containing alkyl groups such as OCHCH3OC2H5, tOCH2CH2Of1 4OHw fOCH2CH2O 1 4H, EMI17.2 and the like.In the above examples of suitable end groups, M is alkali metal, ammonium, alkanol amine, alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, tetraalkyl ammonium groups and alkanol amine groups having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, and R is hydrogen or alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms. As will occur to those skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure, the chemically stable end groups at the polyacetal carboxylate termini can be alike or unlike. As a further example of the polyacetal carboxylates of the present invention wherein the end groups can be different, one end group can be a polymer, and particularly a polymer with an anionic charge, which permits one or more of the polyacetal carboxylates of the present invention to be appended to the polymer, or on the other hand, the polyacetal carboxylates of the present invention can be the part of a block copolymer having a polymer chain at each of the polyacetal carboxylate termini.Preferred polymers that are anionic or can be made anionic include polymers of cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. In the case of an anionic polymer, the polymer can be used to initiate the polymerization to form the polyacetal carboxylates wherein the polymer adds to the termini as one of the chemically stable end groups to stabilize that end of the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization and thereafter the other end of the polyacetal carboxylate can be stabilized with a compound such as ethylene oxide or the like, as described above, In one embodiment of this invention, diethylsodiomalonate or sodiomethylmalonate is used as an initiator to form the polymer.These compounds not only serve to initiate the polymerization, but also the ester adds to the termini as one of the chemically stable end groups to stabilize that end of the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid hydrolysis in an alkaline solution. These compounds can be prepared from the corresponding esters using sodium hydride in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, by techniques known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it can be seen that in one embodiment of this invention the builder mixture contains a water soluble polyacetal carboxylate having the structure EMI18.1 wherein M is selected from the group consisting of alkali metal, ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium groups and alkanol amine groups having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain n averages at least 4 and R1 and R2 are individually any chemically stable group which stabilizes the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization. The number of repeating units, i.e., the value of n, in the polyacetal carboxylate is important since the effectiveness of the polyacetal carboxylate salt as a detergency builder is affected by the chain length. Even when there are as few as four repeating units i.e., n averages 4 , the polyacetal carboxylate salt shows some effectiveness as a sequestrant, chelating agent and builder.Although there is no upper limit to the desired number of repeating units, which may be as high as 400, or even higher, there does not seem to be an advantage to having more than about 200 repeating units. When the number of repeating units exceeds about 100, significant improvement in sequestration, chelating and builder properties is not observed. Thus, it is preferred that the polyacetal carboxylate contain between about 10 and about 200 units, and even more preferred that the polyacetal carboxylate contains between about 50 and about 100 repeating units. The most important factors believed to control the chain length include 1 the initiator concentration, 2 the temperature of the polymerization, 3 the purity of the starting materials, and 4 the presence of solvents and their levels. As will occur to those skilled in the art, the concentration of the initiator, solvents and their levels, and the temperature of the polymerization reaction are ali interrelated and the desired chain length can easily be controlled by simple experimentation by controlling these variables. Generally speaking, the lower the temperature at the beginning of the polymerization, the higher the chain length.For example, when polymerization was initiated with one mole percent 2 hydroxy pyridine H2O complex at a temperature of 700C. , the resulting polyacetal carboxylate contained 60 repeating units as determined by Proton Magnetic Resonance PMR . On the other hand, when one mole percent 2 hydroxy pyridine H2O complex was used at about 200C, the resulting polyacetal carboxylate had only about 20 repeating units. The polyacetal carboxylate can also contain other polymer fragments, and accordingly, the polymer can be a linear homopolymer or copolymer, or it can be branched. To form a copolymer, the polyacetal carboxylate segments are polymerized with any number of chain extending agents known to those skilled in the art. It is only necessary that the chain extending agent does not cause the polyacetal carboxylate to depolymerize or become insoluble in water. Either aliphatic or aromatic chain extending agents can be used, but aliphatic chain extending agents are preferred to make the polymer more environmentally acceptable, and aliphatic chain extending agents having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide1 are especially preferred. It is important that a copolymer contains at least 4 repeating units i.e., n averages at least 4 of the acetal carboxylate to insure that the copolymer will effectively sequester calcium and magnesium ions and provide builder properties. It is preferred that the copolymer contain at least 10 repeating units of acetal carboxylate, or more, say 50 or 100 repeating units, for the reasons described above.As will occur to those skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure, having at least 4 acetal carboxylate units in a copolymer prepared by block or graft polymerization techniques should not present a problem, but when acetal carboxylate esters are copolymerized with a chain extending agent, the amount of acetal carboxylate should be at least about 50 by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer, to insure that the polymer will effectively sequester calcium and magnesium ions and retain its builder properties. It is preferred that the amount of acetal carboxylate is 80 by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer, or even higher. As will occur to those skilled in the art, any number of chain extending agents can be copolymerized with the polyacetal carboxylates of the present invention. It is only necessary that the chain extending agent will provide at least two reactive sites.Suitable chain extending agents include polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and the like epoxy compounds, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, epihalohydrin epoxysuccinates and the like aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and the like. It is particularly beneficial when the chain extending agent contains substituent carboxy groups. Thus, it can be seen that in one embodiment of this invention the builder mixture contains a stabilized water soluble polymer comprising polyacetal carboxylate segments having the general formula EMI20.1 where Y is at least one chain extending agent, preferably alkyl or oxyalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, p averages at least 4, q is at least 1, and M is selected from the group consisting of alkali metal, ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium groups and alkanol amine groups having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain.Furthermore, the polyacetal carboxylates having a chain extending agent can be stabilized by the same techniques used above using suitable reagents or polymers as described above. The polyacetal carboxylate ester can be converted to the corresponding alkali metal, ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium or alkanol amine salts by conventional saponification techniques.Generally, the use of the alkali metal salts, particularly the sodium salt, is preferred. However, in some formulations where greater builder solubility is required, the use of ammonium or alkanol ammonium salts may be desirable. The detergent compositions of the invention provide a pH of from about 6 to about 8.5, preferably from about 6.5 to about 8, and most preferably about 7, in a 0.2 by weight water solution at 200C. This characteristic can be provided by any suitable means including the addition of acidic material or use of anionic surfactants in a unneutralized acid form. The detergent compositions of the invention are generally used in aqueous washing solutions containing from about 0.05 to about 1 of the detergent composition by weight. Use as a laundry detergent composition is a preferred embodiment, but the compositions can also be used for hard surface cleaning such as dishwashing or interior household surfaces.

The cleaning advantages contributed by amylolytic enzymes is particularly enhanced by the low solution pH values provided by compositions of the invention. Preferably the enzyme components are characterized by an isoelectric point of from about 6 to about 9, most preferably from about 6.5 to about 8.5. Preferred enzymes have an activity at pH values of 6.0 to 8.5 than at higher pH values.
