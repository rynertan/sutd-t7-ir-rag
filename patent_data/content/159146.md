# Turbocharger for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A turbocharger 1 for an internal combustion engine includes a turbine drivable by the exhaust energy of the internal combustion engine, and an air compressor coupled by a shaft 7 to an impeller 9 of the turbine for charging air into engine cylinders in response to rotation of the shaft. A rotor 13 is mounted on the shaft and stator coils are disposed around the rotor. The rotor and the stator coils jointly constitute a motor generator which operates as a motor or a generator dependent on operating conditions of the internal combustion engine.
