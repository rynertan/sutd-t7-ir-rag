# Immersion cooled high density electronic assembly.

## Abstract
A liquid immersion cooled electronic assembly including circuit elements provided in stacks of circuit boards, with means supporting the boards and the stacks being arranged adjacent to one another but spaced apart to form coolant flow columns therebetween. The entire structure is within a container or tank for total immersion in a coolant liquid. Means are provided for supplying fluid into alternate ones of said coolant flow columns and out the others, to establish coolant flow between and across the circuit boards of the stacks.
