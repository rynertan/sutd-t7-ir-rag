# Novel N,N bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl oxamides and chemiluminescent compositions containing the same.

## Abstract
N,N bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl oxamides are de scribed with 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, ethoxycarbonyl methyl, and phenylmethoxy carbonyl methyl substitution at the amido nitrogen atoms. These compounds, when used in chemiluminescent formulations, furnish superior light capacity and quantum efficiency. Preparation of the com pounds and their use for chemiluminescence are described.
