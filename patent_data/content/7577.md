# Method of improving the adhesion of electroless metal deposits.

## Abstract
Method for promoting and improving the adhesion of an electroless metal deposit to the metal surface of a composite substrate having both a conductive metal area and an acti vated non conductive surface. The process comprises treat ing such a substrate, subsequent to catalyzation or activation of the substrate and prior to electroless metal deposition thereon, with an adhesion promoter compound or mixture of compounds.
