## Description
The present invention relates generally to operator s cabs such as mounted on self propelled crop harvesting machines, such as combines, and, more particularly, to improvements in the construction of the operator s cab to maximize the operator s vision of the crop harvesting operation. Modern self propelled crop harvesting machines are generally equipped with an enclosed operator s cab in which the operator is seated to control the harvesting operation of his machine. Such operator s cabs are generally provided with environmental controls, such as air conditioning and sound absorbing materials, to improve the quality of the work environment for the operator. Operator cabs are generally mounted at an elevated position on the crop harvesting machine to afford the operator a field of view of the harvesting operation relating to the gathering of crop material from the field in which he is operating. To permit this field of view, the cab enclosure is provided with a number of transparent panels, normally glass, supported from vertical posts extending between the floor member and the roof member of the cab. Typically, the glass panels are supported from rubber glazing elements that encircle each panel of glass. Each glazing element is supported from one of the vertical posts or other portions of the cab housing to completely encircle the perimeter of the transparent panels. As a result, each joint between adjacent glass panels is provided with two glazing elements plus a structural element of the cab separating and supporting the adjacent glazing elements. While this approach offers easy assembly and serviceability, a great amount of visual obstruction is encountered. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an operator s cab, such as for a self propelled crop harvesting machine, that provides glass support having minimal visual obstruction without loss of structural strength of the structural elements. In an attempt to accomplish this objective, DE A 2.060.371 has already proposed to provide a support post with an angled extension and a glazing element attached thereto at a location generally within the width of the obstructing dimension of this post, i.e. the dimension extending generally perpendicular to the line of sight from the operator s station. This extension and the corresponding glazing element thereby are hidden from the operator behind said post whereby they do not obstruct the field of view of the operator. This arrangement permits the glazing element to engage and support one transparent panel but fails to provide the same advantageous solution when a pair of adjacent transparent panels have to be supported and retained by one support post. However, this advantageous solution is obtained with the present invention which is in the form of an operator s cab which provides a field of view to an operator positioned at an operator s station within the cab which includes support posts and an enclosure with transparent panels supported at least partially by said posts and of which Preferably, the glazing elements are positioned behind the corresponding support posts so that they are substantially completely hidden from the operator behind said support posts whereby they do not detract from the operator s field of vision. Also, said obstructing width of each support post extending perpendicular to the line of sight of the operator is less than the eye spacing of the operator to permit full vision of the harvesting operation at a resonable distance outside the cab. The advantages of this invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed disclosure of the invention, especially when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Referring now to the drawings and, particularly, to Fig. 1, a perspective view of the operator s cab mounted on a self propelled crop harvesting machine, commonly referred to as a combine, can be seen. Any left and right references are used as a matter of convenience and are determined by standing at the rear of the machine, facing the forward end, the direction of travel. The self propelled crop harvesting machine 10 is fragmentarily shown and represents a conventional combine harvester however, one skilled in the art will readily realize that the principles of the instant invention will not be limited to the type of machine on which the operator s cab is mounted. As a matter of fact, the operator s cab according to the present invention may be used on a wide variety of machines, inclusive on tractors and on machines other than agricultural machines. The cab according to the invention even may be used on pull type machines in the exceptional situation where pull type machines are equipped with their own cab, although clearly the operator s cab according to the invention will be used most commonly on self propelled machines. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the structural details of the operator s cab 12 can best be seen. The cab 12 includes a floor member 14, a roof member 16 vertically spaced above the floor member 14 and an enclosure 18 extending around and encompassing an operator s station 20, shown in the form of a seat, steering wheel, etc. Supporting the roof member 16 above the floor member 14 and at least partially supporting the enclosure 18, the operator s cab 12 is provided with a plurality of support posts namely, a right rear support post 22, a right side post 24, two front support posts 25, a left side post 26 and a left rear support post 28, spaced around the periphery of the enclosure 18. As best seen in Fig. 2, the operator 30 positioned at the operator s station 20 is provided with a field of vision extending radially from the right rear support post 22 to the left rear support post 28. To permit the operator 30 to observe the crop harvesting operation conventionally occurring in front of him, the enclosure 18 includes a right side window 31 supported between the right rear support post 22 and the right side post 24, a right side transparent panel 33 typically glass supported between the right side post 24 and the right front post 25a, a large curved front transparent panel 35 supported between the right front post 25a and the left front post 25b, a left side transparent panel 37 supported between the left front post 25b and the left side post 26, and a transparent access door 40 pivotally supported for movement about a hinge axis 42 mounted on the left side post 26 and closing against the left rear support post 28. Unlike the combine 10 depicted in Fig. 1, some crop harvesting machines will not have structural elements positioned immediately rearwardly of the operator s cab 12 and, accordingly, the enclosure 18 can optionally incorporate a rear window 39 supported between the right rear post 22 and the left rear post 28. As best seen in Fig. 2, the support posts forwardly of the operator s station 20, namely, the right side post 24, the two front posts 25 and the left side post 26, are oriented to minimize the obstruction to the field of view of the operator 30. The obstructing dimension D, i.e., the dimension of the support posts perpendicular to the line of sight L of the operator 30, for each forward support post 24,25,26 is less than the eye spacing of the operator 30. As a result, the operator 30 will have full vision of the harvesting operation occurring in the field before him at a reasonable distance outside the cab enclosure 18. The glazing elements 45,65 supporting and retaining the respective transparent panels are located on the opposing side of the respective support posts from the operator s station 20 in such a manner that the glazing elements 45,65 are hidden behind the respective support posts and, thereby, do not further detract from the operator s field of vision. Referring now to Figs. 3 6, the structural details of the support posts can best be seen. Fig. 3 shows that the right rear support post 22 is constructed as a generally hollow box like member, permitting the passage of wiring, heater hoses, air conditioning hoses, etc. between the roof member 16 and the floor member 14. The oblong glazing element 45 supporting the rear window 39 is attached to a leg 47 formed in the support post 22. A seal 49 for the side window 31, which is hinged along its upper horizontal edge not shown to open outwardly, is affixed to the support post 22. As best seen in Fig. 2, the left rear support post 28 is constructed as a mirror image of the right rear support post 22 with the left rear post 28 having a seal for the closure of the access door 40 instead of the window 31. Both rear posts 22,28 are generally vertically oriented. Referring now to the cross sectional views of Figs. 2 and 4, the right side support post 24 can best be seen. As best seen in Fig. 1, the forward support posts 24,25,26 are inclined forwardly and or outwardly with respect to a vertical line to locate the respective transparent panels 33,35,37 at an angle to reduce glare problems. The right side post 24 is formed into an oblong hollow beam 50 having a major dimension 51 greater than a minor dimension 53. As best seen in Fig. 2, the beam 50 is oriented such that the major dimension 51 is parallel to the line of sight L of the operator 30 and, therefore, the minor dimension 53 becomes the obstructing dimension D. The leg 56 of the post 24 supports a seal 49 for the side window 31. Another leg 58 permits attachment of the oblong glazing element 45 at a position behind the beam 50 to permit the support and retention of the right side transparent panel 33 without exposing the glazing element 45 to the line of sight L of the operator 30. As best seen in Fig. 4, the width of the oblong glazing element 45 is less than the minor dimension 53, permitting the glazing element 45 to be hid entirely behind the post 24 and out of the field of vision of the operator 30. As with the rear support posts 22,28, the hollow beam 50 can permit the passage of wiring, etc. between the floor member 14 and the roof member 16. Referring now to Figs. 2 and 5, the structural details of the front support posts 25 can best be seen. Each support post 25 is formed as a generally U shaped channel 60 having inwardly directed legs 62. The obstructing dimension D is again smaller than the eye spacing of the operator 30 to permit a full view of the harvesting operation at a reasonable distance beyond the enclosure 18. A glazing extrusion 65 engages the channel member 60 and supports and retains adjacent glass panels 33,35. While Fig. 5 depicts the right front post 25a, the right front post 25a and the left front post 25b are constructed identically, except that the left front post 25b is provided with a glazing extrusion 65 that supports and retains adjacent transparent panels 35,37. The glazing extrusion 65 is formed in two integral portions, an attachment portion 66 and a glass retention portion 68. The somewhat bulbous attachment portion 66 is adapted to be received within the channel member 60 and retained in position by the inwardly directed legs 62. To facilitate deformation of the attachment portion 66 for positioning within the channel members 60, a hole 67 extends axially through the attachment portion 66. Since the glazing extrusion 65 extends between the roof member 16 and floor member 14, the hole 67 in the attachment portion 66 could be utilized as a drain tube for air conditioning condensate or the like. The glass retention portion 68 projects outwardly from the channel member 60 and is adapted to receive and retain the edges of the adjacent glass panels 33,35 or 35,37, respectively. As best seen in Fig. 5, the glazing extrusion 65 supports the glass panels 33,35 from the support post 25a without the need of a structural member extending therebetween. Since the size of the glass retention portion 68 is smaller than the obstructing dimension D of the channel member 60, the glazing extrusion 65 can be hid out of the line of sight L of the operator 30 behind the channel member 60 as is best seen in Fig. 2. Referring now to Figs. 2 and 6, the structural details of the left side post 26 can be seen. The left side post 26 is formed as an elongated member 70 having a major dimension 71 greater than a minor dimension 73. As with the right side post 24, the elongated member 70 is oriented such that the major dimension 71 is positioned parallel to the line of sight L of the operator 30 and, hence, the minor dimension 73 becomes the obstructing dimension D. Preferably the left side post 26 comprises, as seen in cross section, a pair of box like members which are spaced apart generally in the direction of the line of sight L and which have a width corresponding to the obstructing dimension D. The innermost box like member is generally rectangular in cross section while that the outermost box like member is generally triangular in cross section. The box like members are interconnected by a connecting member of reduced width as seen in a direction perpendicular to the line of sight L and which is positioned generally at one side of the generally elongate cross sectional configuration 70 thus defining a recess between the box like members and the connecting members. The outermost box like member of the left side post 26 is provided with a leg 74 at the opposing side thereof from the operator s station 20 and to which is attached the oblong glazing element 45 for the support and retention of the left side panel 37. The leg 74 and the glazing element 45 are positioned substantially within the width of the minor dimension 73 and generally behind the support post 26 when seen in the direction of the line of sight L from the operator s station. The access door 40 is pivotally supported by a hinge assembly 75 attached to the outermost box like member of the left side post 26 and defining the hinge axis 42. The door 40 is formed by a channel like frame 77 extending around the periphery of the door 40 and supporting a glazing element 45 for retaining a glass panel 78 to permit visibility through the door 40. A seal 79 is affixed to the innermost box like member of the left side post 26 at the opposing side thereof from the operator s station 20, i.e. generally within the recess defined between the innermost and outermost box like members and the connecting member. A further seal 79 is also provided to the left rear support post 28. Both seals 79 permit a sealing of the door 40 when in the closed position. The hinge assembly 75 and the one side member of the generally rectangular door frame 77 to which the hinge assembly 75 is attached, are positioned, as can be best seen in Fig. 6, substantially within the recess defined between the innermost and outermost box like members and the connecting member of the left side support 26 when the access door 40 is in the closed position. Furthermore, when the door 40 is in said closed position, said components, i.e. the hinge assembly 75 and the one door side member also are substantially positioned within the width of the obstructing dimension D as seen in the direction of the line of sight L. One skilled in the art will readily realize that an operator s cab constructed in the manner described above will provide a maximum field of vision for observing the harvesting operation relating to a gathering of crop material from the field without sacrificing structural strength and integrity. The forward support posts 24,25,26 can be inclined out of a vertical orientation to angle the glass panels 33,35,37 for functional improvement, as well as to provide an asthetically pleasing appearance. In addition to improved operator visibility, the instant invention provides enclosed passages for hoses and electrical wiring to improve the aesthetic appearance of the cab 12 from both the inside and the outside. It further is also an advantage of this invention that firm support for the glass panels is provided without stress points and that installation and removal of glass panels can be easily accomplished. It further also will be apparent to anyone skilled in the art that the operator s cab subject of the invention may be used on all sorts of machines inclusive on all sorts of harvesting machines. The operator s station on a variety of machines may be designed such as to be able to receive a single standardized operator s cab, which thus can be utilized in a universal application on a plurality of machines. Such a cab thus may be offered on the market as an independent structure for mounting on any machine designed to receive such a cab.
