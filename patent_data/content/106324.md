Verfahren zur Identifizierung und Quantifizierung allergenspezifischer IgE Spiegel in Patientenserum, umfassend

## Description
This invention relates to methods and reagents for assaying blood serum of patients demonstrating allergic symptoms to identify the source of the allergy and determine the level of the respective allergen specific IgE in the serum. In particular, this invention relates to diagnostic methods and reagents therefor which provide increased specificity and accuracy, the results of which can be reliable used as a basis for determining desensitization dose regimens to be used in treating patients for allergic reactions. Radiometric and fluorometric methods for identifying and measuring allergy specific IgE levels in patient serum are commercially available and are known as the RAST test, for example. U.S. patents RE 29,474 3,555,143 3,648,346 3,720,760 and 3,966,898 relate to these methods and reagents therefor. Enzymatic immunological methods for identifying and quantifying antigens and antibodies in liquids are widely used and are known as the ELISA and EIA, for example. Basic technology for enzymatic assays and reagents therefor is disclosed in U.S. patents RE 29,169 and 3,839,153, for example. A review of the current state of the art with regard to immunoassays for the detection of proteins in solutions is provided by R. Rose et al, Procedures for binding proteins to insoluble supports have been primarily described. Antibodies have also been covalently bonded to insoluble supports as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,551,555, 3,553,310, 4,048,298 and RE 29,474. Binding of antibodies to polystyrene by adsorption has been described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,646,346 and 4,092,408, for example. Allergens have been covalently bonded to a variety of insoluble supports as described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,720,760. Polyethylene glycol has been used in protein fractionation processes as described by A. Polson et al, U.S. patent 4,002,532 discloses an assay in which the combination of 1. allergen adhered to a support 2. IgE from patient serum and 3. anti IgE is also part of the immunocomplex formed for the detection of allergen specific IgE. However, the anti IgE applied is not conjugated to an enzyme. Instead, a fourth component for the formation of the immunocomplex is used which is an anti Ig coupled to an enzyme. The enzyme is preferably detected chromogenically or fluorgenically via a further reagent in the form of a substrate that emits fluorescence upon interaction with the immunocomplex This invention relates to a method for identifying and quantifying allergen specific IgE levels in patient serum comprising The invention further relates to an allergen composition comprising the allergen covalently bonded to a water soluble protein or an amino acid polymer having affinity for a solid polystyrene or styrene vinyl monomer copolymer support, and such an allergen composition wherein the allergen is derived from a pollen, mold, smut, animal dander or epidermal, insect, insect venom, dust, or food. The invention also covers an insoluble diagnostic polystyrene or styrene vinyl monomer copolymer support having adhering to the surface thereof, a covalently bonded conjugate of an allergen and a soluble protein or amino acid polymer such an insoluble diagnostic support wherein the allergen is derived from a pollen, mold, smut, animal dander or epidermal, insect, insect venom, dust, or food and the two above mentioned insoluble diagnostic supports wherein the insoluble support is opaque. A fluorogenic enzyme, as used herein, is defined as an enzyme by means of which suitable substrate will undergo chemical reaction to yield fluorescent products. In the insoluble allergen reagent of this invention the allergen is adherent to the insoluble support preferably by non covalent bonding such as absorption or adsorption, for example. The allergen adhering to the insoluble support is present as a novel intermediate of this invention comprising an allergen covalently bonded to a water soluble polymer having an absorption or adsorption affinity for the insoluble support. The allergen polymer product is adherent to the insoluble support by non covalent bonding. In certain preferred embodiments of this invention, the insoluble support has a plurality of test wells separated by opaque material, the anti IgE antibody is a monoclonal antibody to which alkaline phosphatase is bound, the anti IgE is contacted with the insoluble support in an aqueous solution containing from 1 to 8 weight percent polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 1000 to 10,000 and a non ionic surfactant, and the substrate is 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate. When the allergen bonded to the insoluble support is covalently bonded to a water soluble polymer having absorption or adsorption affinity for the insoluble support, in a preferred procedure the insoluble support is prerinsed with an aqueous buffered rinse solution containing from 0.0001 to 0.5 weight percent of the water soluble polymer. Key to successful treatment of allergic conditions is the accurate identification of the offending allergen and the titration of the patient to determine the desensitization dosage. In general, reconstituted allergen extract is injected in sufficient quantity to cause major production of antigen specific IgG blocking antibody and major production and or activation of suppressor T lymphocytes. However, the quantity should not be sufficient to cause major allergic reaction. To the extent that antigen specific IgE is produced at an increased level, it is critical that the IgG and suppressor IgE production be in such balance as to prevent allergic reaction. The concentration and amount of the desensitization dosage are dependent upon many factors which are specific to the patient undergoing the allergic reaction. It is, therefore, necessary to titrate the patient to determine the proper dosage. A variety of standard techniques are available to carry out this procedure. Examples of traditional procedures are described in The method of this invention provides the specificity and accuracy to determine a suitable desensitization dosage, particularly when the allergen used for desensitization and the allergen component of the diagnostic method have the same allergen profile and specificity. After identification of the offending allergen and quantification of the offending allergen, standard desensitization immunotherapy procedures are employed. The procedure normally used involves injecting into the patient gradually increased doses of the allergen, usually to maximum tolerated doses doses not giving rise to major allergic response , at varying intervals in an attempt to develop IgG antibody protection against the agents and to increase the specific suppressor T lymphocyte activity. With the method of this invention, more exact assessment of the suitable desensitization dose can be initially determined, making unnecessary the exacting procedures formerly required. The exact mechanisms of this treatment are not fully understood. Booster injections to maintain the requisite IgG and suppressor T lymphocyte levels are required at intervals of one to four weeks. Usually the doses required for booster injections are substantially greater than the maximum dose required for control of the initial allergic reaction. The process of this invention comprises a first step of contacting an insoluble support having allergen adhering thereto with patient serum for a sufficient time to permit conjugation of allergen with IgE in the patient serum and then removing the patient serum from the support. In this procedure the patient serum is preferably undiluted prior to contact with the supported allergen. The incubation time should be sufficient to permit substantial conjugation to occur, the time being temperature dependent. Suitable incubation times are from 30 to 180 minutes at temperatures within the range of from 18 to 40 C, the preferred contact time being from 60 to 120 minutes at temperatures within the range of from 20 to 26 C. The insoluble support having the allergen adhering thereto is an important aspect of this invention. The allergen can be any allergenic material such as allergen derived from pollens derived from trees, shrubs, weeds, and grasses molds smuts dusts allergens derived from danders, hair, and epidermals of animals extracts derived from insects including insect venoms and from foods. A wide variety of compounds can be employed as the solid support, the primary consideration being the binding of the allergens to the surface, the absence of interference with the enzyme labeled anti IgE antibody reagent, enzymatic reaction thereof with a substrate and fluorescent properties of the enzymatic reaction product. Organic and inorganic polymers, both natural and synthetic can be employed as the solid support. Examples of suitable polymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, poly 4 methylbutylene , butyl rubber and other synthetic rubbers, silicone rubbers and silastic polymers, polyesters, polyamides, cellulose and cellulose derivatives such as cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose , acrylates, methacrylates, vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, poly vinylidene chloride and polyvinyl fluoride , polystyrene and styrene graft copolymers, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers, rayon, nylon, polyvinyl butyrate and polyformaldehyde. Other materials which can be employed as the insoluble support are silica gel, silicon wafers, glass, paper, insoluble protein, metals, metaleoids, metal oxides, magnetic materials, semiconductive materials or cermets. In addition are included substances that form gels, such as proteins such as gelatins, lipopolysaccharides, silicates, agarose, polyacrylamides or polymers which form several aqueous phases such as dextrans, polyalkylene glycols alkylene with 2 to 3 carbon atoms or surfactants, e.g. amphophilic compounds such as phospholipids and long chain 12 24 carbon atoms alkyl ammonium salts. A preferred diagnostic support of this invention comprises a polystyrene, styrene copolymers including styrene vinyl monomer copolymers such as styrene acrylonitrile copolymers, or polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, and acrylate and methacrylate polymers and copolymers. A particularly advantageous support for this procedure comprises a microtiter plate having a plurality of wells. The well surface or plastic cup inserts therein can constitute the allergen support. Most advantageously, the microtiter plate or the well inserts are opaque to light so that excitation light applied to a well or fluorescence generated in response thereto does not reach or influence contents of the surrounding wells. With this system each well can be employed as a test system independent of the other wells. The allergen is covalently bonded to a water soluble polymer having an affinity for the insoluble substrate and the allergen polymer product is then adhered to the insoluble substrate by non covalent bonding such as by adsorption or absorption. Suitable water soluble proteins include serum albumin of bovine BSA , human HSA , rabbit RSA , goat GSA , sheep SSA and horse HOSA origin serum gamma Globulin of the previously described animals and other animal proteins such as ovalbumin, fribrinogen, thrombin, transferin and glycoproteins. Suitable water soluble amino acid polymers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyalanine, polyhistidine, polymethionine and polyproline. The allergen can be covalently bonded to water soluble protein or amino acid polymer with conventional coupling agents using methods which are known in the art. Preferably the coupling agent is a carbodiimide such as 1 ethyl 3 3 N,N dimethylamino propyl carbodiimide hydrochloride and 1 cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinoethyl carbodiimide methyl p toluenesulfonate. Other suitable coupling agents include aldehyde coupling agents having either ethylenic unsaturation such as acrolein, methacrolin, or 2 butenal or having a plurality of aldehyde groups such as glutaraldehyde, propanedial or butanedial. Other coupling agents include bifunctional NHS esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate, disuccinimidyl tartarate, b When the allergen is covalently bonded to a water soluble polymer having an affinity for the insoluble substrate and the water soluble polymer has antigenic properties the first step is preferably preceded by a prerinse step. In the prerinse step, the support surface is contacted with an aqueous buffered rinse solution containing from 0.0001 to 0.5 weight percent of the water soluble antigenic polymer to which the allergen is bound. This prerinse step is particularly advantageous when the water soluble polymer is water soluble animal protein because rinse residue will provide a sufficient amount of the water soluble protein to conjugate with any of the protein specific IgE which is present in the patient serum. The protein specific IgE would otherwise complex with the protein in the insoluble support as a non specific IgE binding, greatly reducing the sensitivity of the assay. A preferred rinse solution of this invention is an aqueous phosphate buffer solution having a phosphate molarity of from 0.01 to 0.05, a pH of from 6 to 8 and containing from 0.01 to 0.01 weight percent non ionic surfactant and from 0.0001 to 0.5 weight percent of the antigenic protein to which the allergen is coupled. Suitable non ionic surfactants include polyoxyethylene eithers BRIJ such as lauryl, cetyl, oleyl, stearyl, and tridecyl polyoxyethylene ethers polyoxyethylenesorbitans TWEEN such as polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, monopalmitate, monostearate, monoleate and trioleates and other polyoxyethylene ethers TRITON , for example. A preferred non ionic surfactant is octylphenoxypolyethoxy ethanol having 40 ethylene oxide units TRITON X 405, Rohm and Haas Company . The buffer solution is advantageously prepared from a reagent concentrate of the invention comprising from 0.005 to 2.5 weight percent of the animal protein corresponding to the animal protein to wheich the allergen is covalently bonded, from 0.5 to 5 weight percent non ionic surfactant, from 10 to 20 weight percent sodium chloride, from 0.15 to 5 weight percent stabilizer and sufficient phosphate salt to provide for a 0.02 to 0.05 M phosphate solution. The pH can be from 6 to 8. The preferred buffer concentrate contains 0.5 weight percent of the animal protein, 0.1 weight percent TRITON X 405 non ionic surfactant, 17 weight percent sodium chloride, and 2 weight percent sodium azide, 0.01 M phosphate and has a pH of 7.4. After conjugation of serum IgE with allergen adhering to the insoluble support has occurred, the patient serum is removed therefrom. Surplus liquid is removed and the solid surface is then rinsed with a suitable rinse solution such as that described above. The second step of the process of this invention comprises contacting the insoluble support with an anti IgE antibody labeled with a fluorogenic enzyme. The incubation is continued for sufficient time to permit serum IgE conjugated with allergen if any on the insoluble support to conjugate with the anti IgE antibody. After incubation, the excess liquid is removed, and the surface of the insoluble support is rinsed with a weak saline solution as described above with respect to the first step to remove unconjugated antibody. Preferably the support is rinsed with the preferred rinse solution of this invention described above. Anit IgE antibodies are available from many sources, and the methodology for producing them is well known and is described in several of the patents and publications cited above. The preferred antibodies are monoclonal antibodies. The technology for making monoclonal antibodies is well developed, and the procedures suitable for making monoclonal anti IgE antibodies are described by D. Catty, et al in Antisera in Immunoassays with special Reference to Monoclonal Antibodies to Human Immunoglobulins , Fluorogenic enzymes and methods for bonding them to antibodies without impairing the ability of the antibody to selectively conjugate with antigen are well known in the art. Suitable enzymes and procedures for coupling them to antibodies are described in U.S. patent no. 4,190,496, for example. The preferred fluorogenic enzymes and the suitable substrates corresponding thereto include horseradish peroxidase for which a suitable substrate is homovanillic acid or 4 hydroxy 3 methoxyphenylacetic acid, beta galactosidase for which a suitable substrate is 4 methylumbelliferyl beta D galactoside, alkaline phosphatase for which a suitable substrate is 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate and other umbelliferyl phosphates such as 4 carboxyumbelliferyl phosphate, and umbelliferyl phosphate 4 carboxy alkylesters. Examples of suitable procedures for enzyme labeling the anti IgE antibody include carbodiimides, dialdehyde, and bifunctional coupling reagents as described in covalent linkage of allergen to water soluble polymer or periodate coupling where enzyme has glycoprotein moiety. The enzyme labeled anti IgE antibody is applied to the insoluble support in an aqueous solution. The solution preferably contains suitable salts and buffers to preserve the reactants and facilitate the conjugation reaction. For example, the solution can contain bovine serum albumin BSA , phosphate buffer solution PBS , and a mild surfactant such as a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester employed in the rinse solutions described above. The rinse solutions described herein can also be used. A Preferred solution of this invention comprises from 0.1 micrograms per ml to 5 micrograms per ml and preferably from 1 microgram per ml to 2 microgram per ml anti IgE antibody in an aqueous phosphate buffered solution having a phosphate molarity of from 0.005 to 0.1 and preferably from 0.01 to 0.05 and a pH of from 6.0 to 8.0 and preferably 7.2 to 7.6. A critical ingredient in the anti IgE solution is polyethylene glycol having molecular weights of from 1000 to 8000 and preferably from 2000 to 4000 in concentrations of from 1 to 8 and preferably from 2 to 6 weight percent. Polyethylene glycols greatly increase the speed and sensitivity of the reaction. Another important ingredient is a non ionic surfactant in concentrations of from 0.01 to 0.5 and preferably from 0.02 to 0.1 weight percent. Suitable non ionic surfactants include those described above with respect to rinse solutions, for example. A preferred non ionic surfactant is TRITON X 405. The surfactant surprisingly reduces the non specific background fluorescence signal in the assay. With the preferred anti IgE solutions of this invention, the incubation time of the solutions with the insoluble support is temperature dependent. At temperatures of 18 to 40 C, incubation times of at least from 30 to 180 minutes can be used. The preferred temperatures are within the range of from 20 to 26 C, and at these temperatures, incubation times from 60 to 120 minutes can be employed. It should be appreciated that prolonged incubation times in any of the steps of this invention can reduce the efficacy of the process. Since rapid analysis is an objective of this invention, the lowest times which still yield the desired accuracy are preferred. The solid support is then rinsed to remove residual, unconjugated enzyme labeled anti IgE antibody. The rinse solutions described above are suitable. The third step of the process of this invention comprises contacting the solid support with a solution of a substrate which undergoes chemical reaction in the presence of the fluorogenic enzyme for a time sufficient for fluorescent compounds to be formed. Suitable substrates and the enzymes they are converted by are known in the art and are described in U.S. patent no. 4,190,496, for example. Examples of substrates have been described hereinabove with respect to the corresponding fluorogenic enzyme. The solid is contacted with an aqueous solution of the substrate containing from 10 ² to 10 ¹⁰ molar and preferably from 10 ⁴ to 10 ⁵ molar concentrations of the substrate. Preferred additional reagents and buffers in the substrate solution include 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol buffer and magnesium chloride, for example. The substrate solution is incubated with the insoluble support for sufficient time for the fluorescent reaction product to form. At temperatures of from 18 to 40 C, incubation times of from 5 to 240 minutes can be used. Preferably, the temperature is within the range of from 20 to 26 C, and the incubation time is from 30 to 90 minutes. The equipment and procedures for determining the level of fluorescence in the substrate solutions are those conventionally employed in the art. The level of fluoresence is a function of the enzyme concentration on the insoluble support which is, in turn, a function of the allergen specific IgE level in the patient serum. By comparing the fluoresence level with the levels measured by carrying out the procedure with control solutions containing known concentrations of the respective allergen specific IgE, the precise concentration of the corresponding IgE antibody in the patient serum can be determined. Suitable fluorometers are the fluorometers by Perkin Elmer, American Instrument Company, and Turner Designs. The Allergenetics Fluorometer Allergenetics, Inc., Mountain View, California is preferred. This invention is further illustrated by the following specific but non limiting examples. Temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade and concentrations are given as weight percents unless otherwise specified. To a solution of timothy grass pollen allergen extract 3 mg ml was added 10 microliters of a 5 wt bovine serum albumin BSA solution. After addition, the solution was kept at 4 C, and 5 mg of 1 Ethyl 3 3 N,N Dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide ECDI was added. The mixture was gently stirred at 4 C for 20 minutes. The additions of both BSA and ECDI were repeated three more times.
