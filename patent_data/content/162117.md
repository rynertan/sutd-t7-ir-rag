## Description
Beer Keg And Method Of Manufacturing ItThe invention relates to a method of manufacturing an approximately cylindrical keg, in particular a beer keg, and to such beer keg. For a long time, there has been the need for making also beer kegs from plastic material. Acryl butadiene styrene formerly employed, however, has proved to be of little suitability for beer kegs, as chemical reactions with beer which affect the beer s quality take place. As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibited the use of such material for making kegs.On the other hand, the fundamental problem of beer kegs made from plastic material is that owing to the closed structure of the keg conventional injection moulding techniques have not been suited to manufacture a single piece keg. Rather has it been necessary to make two separate keg parts by injection moulding, which have been welded thereafter, the one part of the beer keg having approximately the shape of a cup and the second part forming the accessory cover DE OS 24 42 343 . This method has i.a. the disadvantage of that in the ultrasonic spot welding method applied here a multitude of spot weldings which as such do not effect a sealing of the keg must be carried out.Rather must an additional seal ring be introduced between the parts of the beer keg to be joined.As against this the object underlying present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a beer keg, which masers the making of beer kegs at low cost possible. Above all the method is also meant to be suited for making the manufacturing of beer kegs of different sizes lengths possible without expensive readjustments and changes in the apparatus serving to carry out the method. The so prepared beer keg is intended to have a long lifetime and a high resistance to damages. Further, the beer keg is to have a low weight and good heat insulating properties.Moreover, the keg is to make only little noise when rolling and to make a simple and effective cleaning possible.According to the invention these problems are solved by a method of manufacturing an approximately cylindrical beer keg, comprising the following steps a injection moulding of two halves of a beer keg of high density polyethylene or high density polypropylene which are each moulded into the form of a circular cyl inder and have the same diameters and closed front sus faces,the cylinder jackets of the two beer keg halves having approximately the same lengths b clamping the beer keg halves into a holding means such that the center lines of the circular cylindrical beer keg halves coincide and the closed front surfaces of the beer keg halves are averted from each other c face planing the facing edges of the beer keg halves d contact free introduction of the heating elements of a butt welding machine into the free space between the facing edges of the beer keg halves and e pressing the facing edges against each other.Said method, in particular, renders the manufacture of kegs of different lengths possible, as the beer keg halves can be welded in different lengths, no substantial change in the method being necessary.Moreover, the high density polyethylene and the high density polypropylene have very good heat insulating properties and are odourless as well as neutral in taste. The keg manufactured according to the invention, of course, is not only suited for beer but may receive any refreshing drinks whatsoever, including wine or the like.In an advantageous embodiment of the invention it is provided that additional steps, i.e. coating the beer keg s interior with a glass like epoxy resin of similar elasticity like that of the keg wall radiating the kegs interior with an ultraviolet light source introducing the keg into a heating means, be taken. Owing to this the interior space oi the keg can most advantageously be adapted to a multitude of liquids, and the surface quality can even be heightened.In another advantageous embodiment of the invention the removal of that part of the welding seam which stands over into the keg s interior is carried out in addition. This facilitates a successive coating according to claim 2 and, independently thereof, the later cleaning of the keg as inside it is completely smooth.Further, the ready made keg may be subjected to an aftertreatment by cobalt radiation, a partial change in the molecular structure combined with an increase in strength ensuing therefrom cross linking being resultant. Then, the material has a memory, i.e. after deformation it will rather return into its former position.Tn an advantageous embodiment of the invention a bung hole housing which is provided with a collar projecting into the keg for supporting the extractor tube is injectionmoulded integrally with a front surface of the beer keg.The use of the high density polyethylene or the high density polypropylene also renders the one piece formation of a bung hole housing with the keg walling possible and, thus, saves the welding on of the housing conventional, hitherto.The cleaning of beer kegs represents a particular problem and must be investigated separately for each keg material, as the chemical interactions between the beer and the keg wall are substantially dependent on the material. For this the interior can be coated with a gLasalike layer.Experience showed that for cleaning beer kegs made from high density polyethylene or high density polypropylene water containing ozone is particularly suited. The cleaning with ozone containing water has proved successful with the beer kegs made from high density polyethylene or high density polypropylene according to the invention especially for the reason that inside these kegs have smooth surfaces and there are no sharp edges or beads. Preferably, the ozone containing water is applied for 10 to 20 sec.at high pressure in the form of a water jet onto the inner walls of the beer keg. Here, the water has been purified as far as possible from heavy metals, such as iron or manganese and has a pH value less than or 7. What is especially favourable is the combination of the cleaning by ozone containing water and the simultaneous action of ultrasonics, the chemical cleaning, thus, being supported by a mechanical removal of dirt and optionally by further measures, such as ionization or the employment of biochemicals.In the following the particulars of a beer keg manufactured according to the method of the invention are described.Here, fig. 1 shows a partial section through a beer keg manu factured according to the invention and fig. 2 a section through an accessory bung hole.Fig. 1 shows a section along the center line of the substantially cylindrlcal beer keg. Two beer keg halves 10,12 firstly are injection moulded separately. The two separate beer keg halves 10 and 12 each have the form of a cup. The two keg halves 10 and 12 consist of high density polyethylene or high density polypropylene. Their cross sections are those of circular cylinders and have the same diameter each. Front surfaces 14,16 are closed throughout, one of the front surfaces receiving the bung hole which will be described more below. In present example of embodiment the cylinder jackets of beer keg halves 10,12 have approximately the same height. On the exterior of cylindrical wallings 18,20 of beer keg halves 10,12 there are provided roller bandslia for rolling away the beer keg. For manufacturing the closed beer keg the two beer keg halves 10 and 12 are clamped into a means so as to make their center lines coincide. Walls 18,20 of beer keg halves 10 and 12 are in alignment. Walling 18 or 20, resp., is thickened within the range of the facing edges 56 of beer keg halves 10 and 12. The beer keg halves 10 and 12 coaxially clamped then are face planed or face milled on their edges 56. Thereafter, heating elements of a buttwelding machine are introduced into the free space between edges 56 of beer keg wallings 18 resp. 20, which plastify beer keg wallings 18 and 20 within the range of their edges 56. Upon removal of the heating elements of a buttwelding machine not shown the beer keg halves are pressed against each other till welding is terminated, the pressing lasting most typically about 20 min. at a wall thickness of 10 to 12 mm.Fig. 2 shows a section through bung hole 30 provided in one of the front surfaces 16 of the so manufactured beer keg. Bung hole housing 32 is injection moulded integrally with front surface 16 of one of beer keg halves 12, no special welding for the bung hole housing being, therefore, necessary.Bung hole housing 32 shows a collar 34 projecting into the keg, on the one hand, and a second keg 40 projecting outwardly, on the other. Collar 34 projecting into the keg supports extractor tube 36, while the second collar 40 projecting outwardly is provided with projecting rim 44 on its inner edge, rim 44 being faced by another rim 48 projecting from head 46 of extractor tube 36, such that seal 50 is to be disposed below projecting rims 44,48.Seal 50 is pressed by means of spiral spring 52, which is supported by collar 34 projecting into the keg, against projecting rims 44,48.In the example of embodiment according to fig. 1 the weld ing seam between the two beer keg halves 10 and 12 is provided between the roller bands54 thereof. In particular in the case of smaller kegs it is even possible to provide the seam between the beer keg halves within the range of a roller band54, the thickening thereof serving as a welding edge at the same time.An alternative method of coating the interior wall of the keg comprises the steps of filling into the keg a solution of PVDC applying G pressure of typically II bars to the keg and removing excess PVDG fluid and reconditioning of the kegs in an oven. Kegs are preferably moved slowly during the heat treatment and stay in the oven for some time. For the alternative coating method, too, a cobalt radiation scheme can be subsequently employed, leading to a cross linking. The features given expression to in the foregoing specification, the claims and the drawing can be essential for the embodiment of the invention, both individually and in any combination whatsoever.The method of making a keg, and a keg made accordingly, where the keg has an oval Instead of a circular cross section yields a certain advantage if the kegs are to be handled, in actual use, by a fork lifter or similar devices.
