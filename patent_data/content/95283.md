# MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
Memory device comprises a glass substrate 1 , a layer of indium tin oxide 2 , a layer of p type semiconductor 3 , a layer of i type semiconductor 4 , a layer of n type semicon ductor 5 and a layer of spots of an electrically conducting material 6 . Silicon is the preferred semiconductor. The device is conditioned by the application of a voltage sufficiently large to cause the structure to be permanently modified to reduce the electrical resistance of the layers. It is a feature of the device that no p and n layers are adjacent.
