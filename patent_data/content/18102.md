## Description
FUNCTIONALISED INORGANIC OXIDE PRODUCTS AND THEIR USE IN THE REMOVAL OF HEAVY METALS, TRANSITION METALS AND ACTINIDE METALS FROM SOLUTION. The present invention relates to functionalised inorganic oxide products and to their use in the removal of heavy metals, transition metals and actinide metals from solution and in particular to the removal of rhodium from a solution containing one or more of acetic acid, methanol, acetic anhydride, methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and water and a rhodium complex formed on mixing a rhodium component and a halogen containing component in the presence of carbon monoxide. The removal of metals from solution has in recent times assumed increasing importance not only from the view point of environmental protection but also that of process economics.Thus in the manufacture of chlorine and caustic soda by the electrolysis of brine in mercury cathode electrolytic cells the depleted brine leaving the cells contains a small concentration of mercury, usually between 2 and 10 mg l, either in the form of elemental mercury or mercury compounds. Discharge of this depleted brine to a water course would both pollute the water and result in a loss of mercury which is significant in terms of process economics. As a result of the growing demand for uranium as a nuclear fuel, the recovery of uranium from solutions produced in the hydrometallurgical proqwssing of uranium bearing materials is also of major importance. In the photographic industry it is desirable on economic grounds to recover silver from residues.Furthermore in the chemical industry many catalytic processes involve liquid phase reactions employing solubleGroup VIII metal catalysts. Thus aldehydes and alcohols are produced by the hydroformylation of olefins in the presence of rhodium and cobalt catalysts and acetic acid is produced by reacting methanol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a rhodium catalyst and a suitable promoter compound. A desirable objective is to recover from the reaction products the metal component of the catalyst in a form which facilitates reprocessing to the catalytic species.Our British PatentSpecification No. 1530039 describes and claims a product suitable for the removal of heavy metals, transition metals and actinide metals from solution, obtained by reacting an inorganic solid containing surface hydroxyl groups in a first stage with a compound of formula I EMI2.1 wherein R is a divalent organic group containing up to 20 carbon atoms, R1 and R2 are halogen atoms or organic radicals containing 3 up to 20 carbon atoms, Y is a halogen atom or an OR3 group in which R3 represents an H atom or an alkyl, aryl or acyl group containing up to 20 carbon atoms, and X is a halogen atom and reacting the product of the first stage at elevated temperature with a polyamine of general formula II NR4flTc 5 NH 6 7 2n m 2n Cli wherein R4, R5, R6.nd R7 represent H atoms, alkyl or aryl groups containing up to 20 carbon atoms and may be the same or different, n is an integer between 1 and 5, and m is an integer between 1 and 5, or a polyamine of formula III EMI2.2 In another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the removal of heavy metals, transition metals and actinide metals from solution which process comprises contacting the solution with the second stage reaction product as hereinbefore described and recovering an effluent of reduced metal content. We have now found that a product similar to the product obtained in two stages as described in the complete specification of British Patent No. 1530039 can be obtained in a single stage and that the product so obtained will remove heavy metals, transition metals and actinide metals from solutions containing them. In particular the product will remove rhodium from a solution containing rhodium and a halogen containing component and one or more of acetic acid, methanol, acetic anhydride, methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and water. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a product, suitable for the removal of heavy metals, transition metals and actinide metals from solution, which product is obtained by reacting an inorganic solid containing surface hydroxyl groups with a compound of formula EMI3.1 wherein the formula IV R is a divalent organic group containing up to 20 carbon atoms R1, R2 and R3 are independently ,OR8 groups wherein R8 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, aryl or acyl group containing up to 20 carbon atoms R4, R5, R6 and R7 represent independently hydrogen atoms, alkyl or aryl groups containing up to 20 carbon atoms and n and m are integers in the range 1 to 5. The inorganic solid containing surface hydroxyl groups may be alumina, titania, zirconia, glass, sepiolite or a zeolitic molecular sieve. Preferably the inorganic solid is silica and more preferably it is silica gel. Furthermore mixtures of inorganic solids may suitably be employed. Unless they have been subjected to severe treatments, e.g. heating above 10000C, all commercial silicas contain surface hydroxyl groups. However for applications in which the product is to be contacted with alkaline media, in which silica would be attacked, it is preferred to employ an alkali resistant inorganic solid. In the formula IV RÚ, Rê and R are preferably identical alkoxy or aryloxy groups, even more preferably identical alkoxy groups. R is suitable an alkylene group containing up to 6 carbon atoms and is preferably a polymethylene groupThe groups R4 , R5, R6 and R7 are preferably hydrogen atoms, n is preferably 2 and m is preferably 1, 2 or 3. Preferably the compound of formula IV isEMI4.1 wherein R9 is an alkyl or aryl group, x is an integer in the range 1 to 6, and m has a value 1, 2 or 3. A particularly preferred compound having the formula V is CH30 3Si CH2 3NH CH2 2NH CH2 2 2 Compounds having the formula V may be prepared by methods wellknown in the art or may be obtained commercially.In the case of silica having surface hydroxyl groups and the compound having the formula V the product is believed to be formed by the simplified reaction represented by the following equation EMI4.2 However the invention is not intended to be restricted in any way by the above equation representing the formation of the product. Although ambient temperatures may be employed the reaction between the inorganic oxide and the compound of formula IV is preferably effected by heating the reactants together, e.g.under reflux, in the presence of an inert solvent for the compound pf formula IV for a period sufficient for formation of the product, e.g. from 1 to 10 hours. Suitable inert solvents for the compound of formula IV include paraffinic and aromatic hydrocarbons. A particularly suitable solvent is toluene. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the removal of a heavy metal, a transition metal or an actinide metal from a solution containing the metal in the form of a soluble compound thereof, which process comprises contacting the solution with the product as hereinbefore described. Within the context of the present application the term heavy metal means a metal in a B sub group of Groups I to VI of the Periodic Table as published in Advanced Inorganic Chemistry by Cotton and Wilkinson, published by Interscience, 1st and 2nd editions. Copper, mercury, silver and lead are typical heavy metals. The transition metal is defined as a metal having an incomplete d shell of electrons in its electronic configuration.The term transition metal may be further sub divided into nonnoble transition metals, e.g. manganese, iron, nickel and cobalt, and noble transition metals, which are transition metals generally considered to be highly resistant to oxidation, e.g. ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, osmium and iridium. The term actinide metal is defined as a metal with an atomic number equal to or greater than 89 and includes uranium, thorium and plutonium. The product may be used for removing metals from both aqueous and organic solutions. Although the process is directly applicable to the removal of metals present in solution as soluble compounds thereof it may be extended to the removal of metals present as insoluble compounds or as elemental metal by a suitable pre treatment to convert them to soluble compounds The solution containing the metal in the form of a soluble compound thereof may be contacted with the product at any temperature in the range 0 to 3000C. Atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure may be employed. The use of superatmos pheric pressure is particularly suitable to prevent boiling at elevated temperature. The product is thought to remove the metals by complex compound formation through the nitrogen groups bonded to the silica surface. The solution may be contacted with the product batchwise or preferably continuously by passing the solution over a bed of the product housed in a suitable reactor. The metals may be recovered, if desired, from the product by methods well known to those skilled in the art. One such method for removing the metal from the product is to elute the metal loaded product with an aqueous solution of a mineral acid. Alternatively it may be preferable to elute certain metals with an organic eluting agent or, in the case of uranium for example basic solutions, e.g. ammoniacal ammonium carbonate. The product is particularly suitable for removing rhodium from solution, especially from solutions obtained from rhodium catalysed reactions in which a carboxylic acid, an ester an alcohol an ether or an anhydride is produced. One such process in which a carboxylic acid is produced by the reaction of an alcohol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst system formed on mixing a rhodium component and a halogen containing component is described, for example, in British Patent Specification No 1 355 146 Monsanto and a process for regenerating a metal catalyst complex useful in such a process is described in British Patent Specification No 1 425 872 Monsanto .The regeneration process described involves precipitation of the rhodium complex from solution. We have now found that the rhodium can be recovered by contacting a catalyst solution with the product of the present invention without the need to precipitate the rhodium complex. Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the recovery of rhodium from a solution comprising one or more of acetic acid, methanol, acetic anhydride, methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and water and a rhodium complex formed on mixing a rhodium component and a halogen containing component in the presence of carbon monoxide which process comprises contacting the solution with the product as hereinbefore described and thereafter separating the product containing rhodium from the solution depleted in rhodium. The rhodium component may be in the form of a salt, oxide, complex or co ordination compound. Included among the large number of possible rhodium components are, for example,RhC13.xH20, RhBr3,RhI3,Rh NO3 3. 2H2O Rh2O3,Rh2O3.5H2O, Rh2 CO Cl 2 Rh2 CO qBr2 Rh2 CO 4 2 and Rh4 CO though this list is by no means considered to be a limiting one. The halogen containing component may be HI, iodine itself or any iodine containing compound such as an alkyl iodide, for example methyl iodide and ethyl iodide, an aryl iodide such as phenyl iodide, or an iodine salt, for example sodium or potassium iodide, and ammonium iodide. The rhodium may thereafter be recovered from the product, converted into the catalytic species or a species suitable for forming the active catalytic species under the carbonylation reaction conditions and recycled to the process. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.For the purpose of Example 2 a liquid feedstock similar to that described in British Patent Specification No. 1,425,872 was made up in the following manner Glacial acetic acid 150 ml , methanol 100 ml , water 30 ml , methyl iodide 15 ml and rhodium tri iodide 3 g were placed in a 500 ml autoclave.
