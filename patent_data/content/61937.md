# Adjustable photoelectric detector head for solid state limit switch.

## Abstract
A diffuse reflective photoelectric detector head 2 for a solid state limit switch 4 having a photoreceiver 18 with a fixed field of view FV and a light source 20 pivotally adjustable to cause its light beam LB to intersect the field of view FV at varying distances from the detector head, the adjustment being indicated by a mechanical indicator 26f . The head is mountable on a limit switch enclosure 8 in any of four major axis positions, with electrical connections 22a 50a, b, c for the head being made at the junction of head 2 and enclosure 8 .
