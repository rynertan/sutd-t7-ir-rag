# Camber monitoring tensiometer.

## Abstract
A device for monitoring the flatness or camber of a moving metal strip is disclosed. The device includes a cylindrical roller over which the metal strip travels, which cylindrical roller is independently supported at each end on a plate which is pivotally mounted on top of a housing for two load cells situated on opposite sides of the centreline of the strip product. Two projections provided on the underside of the plate bear against the load cells in a manner whereby any difference in tension across the width of the strip may be detected as a difference in pressures exerted on the two load cells.
