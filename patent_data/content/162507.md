# Video signal processing arrangement.

## Abstract
A video signal processing arrangement comprises an input 1 for receiving an input video signal and an output 2 at which the processed signal is produced. The arrange ment includes a vertical filter 3 , a horizontal filter 4 , a vertical interpolator 5 a horizontal interpolator 6 , and a field store 7 arranged in cascade. The cut off frequencies of the vertical and horizontal filters 3,4 are adjustable by means of signals passed over paths 18 and 19 from the control circuit 8 to the filters 3,4 . A control arrangement comprising a potentiometer 25 , a switch 23 , and an analogue to digital converter 26 pro duces signals which are passed over a path 24 to the control circuit 8 . These signals are used to cause the control circuit 8 to produce signals over paths 18,19 to the filters 3,4 which reduce the cut off frequencies of the filters to a value which is below that appropriate to the picture size. This pro duces a soft focus effct.
