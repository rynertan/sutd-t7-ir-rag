## Description
POLYMERIZABLE ACETYLENIC OLIGOMERS This invention relates to a polymerizable oligomer and a process of producing said oligomers. U. S. patent 3,300,457 discloses the preparation of acetylenic polymers by the self condensation reaction resulting from the oxidative coupling of organic compounds containing at least two terminal acetylenic groups directly bonded to the organic nucleus. The process disclosed in theU. S. Patent 3,300,457 comprises reacting such compounds with oxygen in homogeneous solution in the presence of a dissolved oxygen carrying intermediate comprising an amine basic cupric salt complex. According to the invention there is provided a polymerizable oligomer having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein D isEMI1.2 M is C C , CEC CEC, O ,EMI1.3 S , EMI1.4 EMI1.5 R is an alkyl or aromatic group, Ar is an aromatic group, x is an integer greater than two but less than 30, z is either zero or an integer, y is an integer with the sum of y and z equal to x, and n is an integer from 1 to 10, said oligomer having more than two pendant acetylenic groups, the average molecular weight of said oligomer being from 200 to 10,000. Further according to the invention there is provided a process for producing a polymerizable oligomer having the general formula EMI2.1 wherein D isEMI2.2 M is C C , CrC CC, O ,EMI2.3 S , EMI2.4 EMI2.5 R is an alkyl or aromatic group Ar is an aromatic group, x is an integer greater than two but less than 30, z is either zero or an integer, y is an integer with the sum of y and z equal to x and n is an integer from 1 to 10, said oligomer having more than two pendant acetylenic groups, the average molecular weight of said oligomer being from 200 to 10,000, the process comprising reacting a monomer containing at least two ethynyl groups in the presence of a catalyst with an aromatic acetylenic capping agent having a molar excess over the monomer. Preferably the molecular weight of the oligomer is from 400 to 2,000 and at least about 60 of the acetylenic groups are diacetylenic. When the expression pendant acetylenic group is used in connection with the formula above, it is used to have the ordinary meaning, i.e. to refer to groups which branch off the main chain, and also to include the terminal groups. It is preferred that diacetylenic groups constitute most of the pendant acetylenic groups. In the U. S. Patent 3,3b0,457 when the starting material contained three or more terminal acetylenic groups, the product was a three dimensional crosslinked, insoluble, infusible polymer. See U. S. Patent 3,300,456, Column 2, lines 51 54. Furthermore, the polymers decompose at about 180 C. Col. 7, line 60 . The oligomers of the present invention are prepolymers which, when polymerized, undergo cross linking and yield polymers which have many desirable and unexpected properties. The oligomers can be processed into coatings and adhesive bonds by a wide variety of coating techniques, for example, either from a Solution or from aMelt. When the prepolymers are advanced by heating above about 140 C, they yield polymers having many desirable and unexpected properties. During this heating cycle, there is essentially little or no gas evolved, which is a very desirable property for adhesives.These oligomers can also be cured by irradiation, such as ultra violet or electron beam radiation. The films are very adherent to a variety of substrates, and can noted p up to over 4000C in trogen with little or no 1GSS in properties. They are very stable and moisture resistant, and are also resistant to both acid and to base. The oligomers of the present invention may be stored, and then polymerized. In the process of forming the oligomers of the present invention, the molecular weight of the oligomers is carefully controlled. This is done by proper choice of the amine used in the reaction, in some cases by using a reverse addition of the catalyst to the monomer, by controlling the rate of addition of the catalyst, and, most significantly, by regulating the amount of monoethynyl capping agent. Thus, in the present invention, workable, useful oligomer pre polymers are obtained. The capping agent referred to above is an aromatic monoethynyl compound, for example phenyl acetylene. The single ethynyl group of the capping agent enters into the coupling reaction, but because the molecule has only one ethynyl group, further coupling is stopped.It is one of the inventive features of the present invention that the molecular weight of the oligomer is controlled by using a molar excess of an aromatic monoethynyl capping agent. The present invention requires more than two ecetylenic functions. Unless this requirement is met, the final product will not be branched and cross linked to the desired degree. It will be clear to those skilled in the art of high temperature polymers that the various structures indicated by D in the formula above represent our preferred structures, and that there are other aromatic structures, such as polyester, polyimide, phenolic, etc., which also fall within the scope of the invention. It should be noted that the oligomers of the present invention are useful when used mixed with each other. In like manner, the ingredients in D in the above formula may be mixtures of the materials specified. By polymerizing mixtures of the oligomers, useful copolymers are obtained. It should also be noted that the formula given above is intended to include those materials in which one or more substitutents are present, for example on the aromatic group shown as Ar or on one or more of the phenyl or phenylene groups. Particularly useful substitutents include alkyl groups and halogens. Such substituents do not at all enter into or interfere with the polymerization reaction. For high temperature uses, it is preferred not to have any alkyl groups because of their tending to degrade at elevated temperatures. In the formulations of the oligomers for end use, it is to be understood that they are to be used like other prepolymers, such as phenolic and epoxies in that fillers, reinforcements and plasticisers can be incorporated over a wide range of concentrations as desired. The following Examples are given solely for the purposes of illustration, and to demonstrate the preferred mode of carrying out the invention. They are not to be construed as limitations on the invention.Example 1 Poly Phenyl Triethynyl Silyl Synthesis The monomer was prepared from the reaction of phenyl trichlorosilane with ethynyl magnesium bromide.The general polymerization procedure is discussed below using the above system.A. Preparation of Poly triethynylphenyl silane Prepolymer I Phenyl triethynyl silane and 300 mole of phenylacetylene were mixed in acetone. 2 was bubbledthrough the solution and the appropriate amount of the catalyst solution added very slowly over several hours. Catalyst Solution l.Og CuCi added to stirred mixture of 0.5 ml tetramethylenediamine in 20 ml acetone. The blue green suspension was allowed to settle, and the copper complex decanted, and stored under N2. 5.0 ml solution for 0.1 mole of CC H. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 hours after addition was complete. The solution was poured onto 2N H2SO4, extracted, dried, and evaporated to dryness. Column chromatography with silica gel and developer hexane eliminated phenylacetylene, diphenyl diacetylene, and very low molecular weight M.W. material. Reverse addition of the catalyst to the ethynyl compound instead of the prior art technique of Hay was necessary to control M.W. Both the rate of addition and of monoethynyl capping reagent are critical to obtain desired M.W. The amount of amine complexed to the copper is always kept minimal to prevent hydrolysis due to the base. Hydrolysis of the silyl ethynyl bond with base occurs to some extent. These materials can be removed by an alumina column chromatography step. Their present easily detected by Infra Red IR Si OH stretch at 3600 cam and were retained in the prepolymer preparations as a possible adhesion promoter. When kept to minimal concentrations, the loss of water with heat to form the siloxane derivative was also minimal and a thermally stable polymer results.B.
