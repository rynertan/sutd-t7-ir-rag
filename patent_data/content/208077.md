# Methods and apparatus for perforating food casing film.

## Abstract
Prestuck food casing films 10 are made with an apparatus having a perforating roll 36 with multiple knife blades 108 . The perforating roll 36 is linked to a power roll 74 so that casing being pulled through the apparatus drives the power roll which turns the perforating roll 36 to perforate the film. The power roll 74 and the perforating roll 36 turn at the same peripheral speed so any change in velocity of the advancing film automatically adjusts the speed of the perforating roll 36 eliminating tears or enlargement of perforations.
