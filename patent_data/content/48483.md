## Description
The present invention relates to a flame retarding polyester composition superior in thermal stability, fluidity and mechanical properties. Thermoplastic polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polycyclohexane dimethylene terephthalate, etc. have found applications in mechanical components, electrical parts, motor vehicle parts and the like. On the other hand, for industrial materials as described above, safety against flames, i.e. flame retardancy, has been strongly required.Besides balancing general chemical and physical properties, with the further requirement that, during injection molding of molded items or heat treatment thereof, the flame retarding agent does not bleed out onto the surfaces of the molded items. Conventionally, as non bleed type flame retarding agents for the thermoplastic polyester, there have been proposed polymeric flame retarding agents such as a halogenated polycarbonate Japanese Laid Open Patent Application Tokkaisho No. 48 52834 and a halogenated epoxy resin Japanese Patent Publication Tokkosho No. 53 18068 , etc. Although the known flame retarding agents as described above, which are mainly composed of tetrabromobisphenol A, are superior in compatibility with respect to polyester, they tend to deteriorate the crystallinity inherent in polyester, thus adversely affecting the mechanical properties, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and electrical properties, etc. of the polyester itself. Meanwhile, there have also been introduced halogen containing polystyrene and halogen containing poly α methylstyrene, together with their applications to thermoplastic polyesters Plastic Technology, July, 1980, pages 71 74 , but in the polyester compounds in which the above flame retarding agents are mixed, marked deterioration of thermal stability and mechanical properties is noticed, with simultaneous reduction of fluidity, thus resulting in poor moldability. Therefore, it has been desired to realize polyester compounds free from undesirable bleeding out of the flame retarding agent, with simultaneous superior flame retardancy and favorable mechanical properties of polyester itself. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a flame retarding polyester compound which is superior in balancing of thermal stability, fluidity and mechanical properties, without bleeding out of the flame retarding agent. It has been found that, by employing halogen containing polystyrene and or halogen containing poly α methylstyrene as flame retarding agents, with a further addition thereto of antimony trioxide and epoxy compounds, a flame retarding polyester compound having superior stability and fluidity, and yet favorably maintaining the mechanical properties of polyester itself, can be obtained.

It is to be noted that, in the examples to be given hereinbelow, and parts are all based on weight, and that, in the illustrative examples and comparative examples, the properties of the resinous composition are determined according to the following methods 35 parts by weight of glass fibers, 12 parts by weight of the flame retarding agent A as stated below, 5 parts by weight of antinomy trioxide, and 1 part by weight of barium stearate were mixed with 100 parts by weight of polyethylene terephthalate PEET with a relative viscosity of 1.35, with further addition thereto of various epoxy compounds as shown in Table 1 at the rate given in Table 1. For the blending, the polyethylene terephthalate, flame retarding agent A , antimony trioxide, barium stearate, and epoxy compounds were mixed by the V blender, with subsequent addition thereto of the glass fibers. The mixtures thus obtained were subjected to melting and kneading at 280 C with the use of the 65 mm extruder to be formed into pellets. After subjecting these pellets to vacuum drying at 130 C for 5 hours, burning test pieces 0,32 1,27 12,7 cm and 0,08 1,27 12.7 cm and tensile dumbbell test pieces were molded at a molding temperature of 280 C and a mold temperature of 130 C, and the minimum injection pressure at this time was recorded. With the use of the above burning test pieces. the vertical burning test was effected according to UL 94 standard, while the tensile property test was made on the basis of ASTM D 638, the results of which are shown in Table 1. Flame retarding agent A From the results of Table 1, it is clear that the composition of the present invention is well balanced in the flammability and mechanical properties. 15 parts by weight of the flame retarding agent A as employed in Example 1, 6 parts by weight of antimony trioxide SBO , 0.1 part by weight of di stearylpentaerythritol diphosphite trade name HI MO made by Sanko Kagaku and 0.5 part by weight of EPIKOTE 190 were mixed with 100 parts by weight of polybutylene terephthalate having a relative viscosity at 1.48, and 35 parts by weight of glass fibers. For the blending, polybutylene terephthalate pellets and flame retarding agent A , antimony trioxide, di stearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, and EPIKOTE 190 were first mixed by the V blender preliminarily, and the glass fibers were mixed, with attention directed so as not to excessively open said glass fibers. The resultant mixture was melted and kneaded at 250 C by the 66 mm extruder so as to be formed into pellets. The pellets thus obtained were formed after drying, into the burning test pieces 0,79 mm and dumbbell test pieces at a molding temperature of 250 C and a mold temperature of 80 C. Upon measurement of the flammability and tensile properties in the similar manner as in Example 1, the tensile strength of 1360 kg cm² and UL94 flammability of V O, were obtained, with the minimum injection pressure of 17 kg cm² and thermal stability of 86 . Meanwhile, as a result of similar tests made on the composition to which only EPIKOTE was not added, the flammability was V O, but the tensile strength was reduced to 1210 kg cm², with simultaneous decrease of the minimum injection pressure to 9 kg cm² and that of the thermal stability to 73 . 100 parts by weight of polybutylene terephthalate with a relative viscosity of 1.70, 17 parts by weight of the flame retarding agent A employed in EXAMPLE 1, 7 parts by weight of antimony trioxide, 0.1 part by weight of thiodistearylpropionate trade name Sumilizer TPS , made by Sumitomo Kagaku , and 0.6 parts by weight of CARDURA E as epoxy compound were mixed at the above rate. For the blending, the V blender were employed, and the resultant mixture was melted and kneaded at 250 C with the use of a 30 mmo extruder to be formed into pellets. After having been dried in hot air at 130 C for 5 hours, the pellets were formed into the burning test pieces 3,17 mm and dumbbell test pieces at a molding temperature of 250 C and a mold temperature of 80 C. Upon subjecting the test pieces to the tensile property tests and UL94 flammability tests in the similar manner as in Example 1, the tensile strength of 580 kg cm², elongation at break of 40 and UL94 flammability of V O were obtained. When the physical property tests were made on the composition without addition of CARDURA E in the similar manner, the flammability was still V O, but the tensile strength was lowered to 560 kg cm², with simultaneous reduction of the elongation at break to 20 .
