# Composite type photosensitive member for electrophotography.

## Abstract
The disclosure is concerned with a photoconductive member useful for electrophotography wherein a charge gene rating layer containing a new metal free phthalocyanine and a charge transport layer containing a nonionic compound of styrylic or oxazol dye base. The photosensitive member exhi bits a high sensitivity to light having a long wavelength and therefore, it is properly used as photosensitive member for printers using semiconductor lasers.
