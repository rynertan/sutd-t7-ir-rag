## Description
The precise mechanisms that control the entry of viruses into the cytoplasm or nuclei are poorly understood. There is evidence that different viruses bind to unique receptor molecules on the plasma membrane of most cells. These receptors determine, at least in part, the host and tissue specificities of certain virus infections. It has been postulated that Hepatitis B virus HBV has binding sites for polymerized human serum albumin and that the polymeric human serum albumin serves as an agent for the specific introduction of HBV into human hepatocytes. It would therefore be desirable to provide vaccines which involve the determinant sites essential to the infectious properties of the virus. Furthermore, the viral proteins or particles may be used for antibody production for use in diagnostic assays and treatment. EP 00 72 313 describes DNA constructs and methods for expressing a Hepatitis B virus polypeptide in yeast, and states that this process may be applied to other HBV polypeptides. However, this document also notes that either a pre S protein would be cleaved in a post translational processing step, or a pre S coding sequence would contain an intron removed by post transcriptional processing page 10, line 21 through page 11, line 6 . Thus, this document implies that a pre S protein cannot be made in yeast due to processing events. Machida DNA constructs, their use and transformation of hosts, and expression of the HBV surface antigen joined at the N terminus to a substantial proportion of the amino acid sequence of the pre S protein. The resultant particles contain a new epitope see Neurath, Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic view of the construction of the plasmid of pHBpreS 347 33T. Methods and compositions are provided for producing novel vaccines to HBV, where the polypeptide includes at least a portion of the pre S protein to provide for a human serum polyalbumin site. The protein vaccines employing the polypeptide, particularly in the form of particles, can be used by itself or in conjunction with human serum polyalbumin, as a vaccine for protecting humans against HBV. Particularly, constructs are provided for expression in yeast, where high yields of the polypeptide are obtained in particulate form, which can be used directly as vaccines, as well as serving as antigens, and as binding agents for human serum polyalbumin, where the polypeptides may be used by themselves or in combination with the polyalbumin, or the like. Since the sequence of the complete HBsAg gene has been cloned, this gene can be obtained from a cloning vector by appropriate restriction and as necessary, employing adapters, resection or the like, to provide for the appropriate termini. Since the gene has been cloned and expressed in a vector, restriction may also include the gene or portions of the gene with appropriate transcriptional or translational regulatory signals. The HBsAg gene or fragment thereof may be joined to a polynucleotide sequence encoding for the remainder of the HBsAg gene and as appropriate, the codons encoding for at least a portion of the Hepatitis B pre surface antigen, either by stepwise addition of oligonucleotide sequences or by ligation of a single fragment. Once the complete nucleotide sequence has been provided which includes the pre surface antigen region joined to the surface antigen, any additional regulatory sequences may be ligated to the appropriate termini and the resulting cassette joined to other nucleotide sequences which provide for desired properties, such as replication, selection, amplification, or the like. The constructs of this invention will for the most part have the following formula The gene may code for any of the various serotypes, including combinations of the sub type determinants d y and w r, more particularly adw. The protein coded for by the indicated gene is referred to as p31 by Machida The gene may be obtained in a variety of ways, either from messenger RNA or from the genome of HBV, preferably from the genome of HBV. The genome may be cleaved at a unique site, e.g., Where the gene has been truncated, the lost base pairs may be restored by employing an adapter for linking to a flanking region providing for the necessary regulatory sequences. Where superfluous base pairs exist, these may be removed in substantial part by resection, employing an exonuclease, such as The cassette construction described above can be prepared and then inserted into an appropriate vector for introduction into a compatible host, such as a unicellular microorganism, including prokaryotes and eukaryotes, e.g., Included on the vector will usually be a gene which allows for selection, due to biocidal resistance, e.g., antibiotic resistance, toxin resistance, heavy metal resistance, or the like affording prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, e.g., leu , his , etc. or affording amplification under stress, such as the genes for dihydrofolate reductase and metallothioneins, e.g., copper chelatin. The vector may be a low or high copy number replication system with low copy number being in the range from about 1 5 and high copy number being in the range of greater than 5 to 100 or more. The various fragments may be joined by any convenient means, the particular protocol depending upon the available restriction sites, ease of providing adapters, available fragments, choice of host, and the like. Of particular interest is a construction employed in yeast, utilizing a high performance promoter, the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH promoter region in conjunction with the GAPDH terminator region. The GAPDH promoter region will have at least 200 base pairs and not more than 1500 base pairs, more usually about 300 to about 1100 base pairs, while the GAPDH terminator region will have at least 300bp and not more than 1500bp, more usually from about 300 to 1200bp. The fragment may extend to the initiator codon of the GAPDH gene, usually not including the initiator codon and will generally be not more than 15 15 , more usually not more than about 10 bases 10 upstream from the initiation codon. The terminator region may include the stop codons of the GAPDH gene and will usually begin not more than about 30bp from the GAPDH stop codons, more usually not more than about 20bp from the GAPDH stop codons. The construction described above is particularly useful in combination with the 2µm plasmid replication system, desirably forming a plasmid of less than about 20kb, more desirably less than about 16kb. The expression constructs comprising the vector and the expression cassette may be introduced into a compatible host by any convenient technique, such as transformation, e.g., polyethylene glycol precipitation, conjugation, transfection, transduction, or the like. The recipient cells may then be grown in an appropriate nutrient medium to a desired density, the cells harvested, a lysate prepared by any convenient means, e.g., agitation with glass beads, and the desired protein harvested. It is found that the p31 protein assembles, so as to form particles of density similar to the known HBsAg particles. Particles can be prepared which are at least 10 mole , usually at least 30 mole more usually 50 to 80 mole of the p31 protein prepared by recombinant technology. The p31 particles are capable of binding to human serum polyalbumin. The particles of the p31 polypeptide are provided in high yield and can be readily isolated in pure form by conventional techniques. Conveniently, the particles may be isolated by affinity chromatography employing a column containing polymerized human serum albumin. Alternatively, separations can be employed using density gradients, gel filtrations, and the like. The techniques may be used individually or in combination. The p31 protein, by itself or assembled as particles, may be used in a variety of ways. Of particular interest is the use of the p31 protein or particle, by itself or in combination with polymerized human serum albumin, individually or as particles, as a vaccine. Any of the conventional methods for administration of a dead virus vaccine are applicable. These include applications on a solid physiologically acceptable base or in a physiologically acceptable dispersion, parenterally, by injection, or the like. The dosage of the vaccine will depend on the route of administration and will vary according to the size of the host. Because the vaccine will have few, if any, side effects, relatively large doses may be used without injury to the host. Normally, the amount of the vaccine will be from about 1µg to 20mg per kilogram of host, more usually from about 5µg to 20µg given subcutaneously or intramuscularly, after mixing with an appropriate carrier or an adjuvant to enhance immunization with the vaccine. Various methods of achieving adjuvant effect for the vaccine include use of agents such as aluminum hydroxide or phosphate alum , commonly used as a 0.05 to 0.1 solution in phosphate buffered saline, admixture with synthetic polymers of sugars Carbopol , used as a 0.25 solution mixture with bacterial cells such as The amount of the adjuvant which is employed will vary widely depending upon the nature of the adjuvant, generally ranging from 0.1 to 100 times the weight of the immunogen, more usually from about 1 to 10 times. In many instances it will be desirable to have multiple administrations of the vaccine, usually not exceeding six vaccinations, more usually not exceeding four vaccinations, and preferably one or more, usually about three vaccinations. The vaccinations will normally be at from 2 to 12 week intervals, more usually from 3 to 5 week intervals, with optional periodic boosters at intervals of 1 to 5 years. The course of the immunization may be followed by assays for antibodies for HBV. The subject p31 proteins or particles can also be used in assays for detecting the presence of antibodies to HBV or complexes of HBV and polymerized serum albumin. In use in assays, the protein or protein complex will normally be labeled with one of a variety of labels which find use in assays. These labels have been extensively reported in the patent and technical literature, and include radionuclides, fluorescers, enzymes, enzyme substrates, particles, small molecules, and the like. Alternatively, the p31 protein or particle can be used for detection of the presence of polymerized serum albumin or removal of polymerized serum albumin from a physiological fluid, e.g., blood. The wild type p31 protein serotypes need not be employed since one or more amino acids may be added, deleted or substituted so long as the serum albumin binding property and immunological properties are retained. Thus, at least 90, usually at least 95, more usually at least 99 number percent of the amino acids will be the correct amino acids and in the correct sequence. Usually, any changes will be at the N terminus where from 0 to 5 amino acids may differ. The p31 protein prepared by hybrid DNA technology may be used by itself or in combination with polymerized human serum albumin, individually or as particles, for the production of antibodies in various mammalian hosts, e.g., murine, bovine, ovine, lagomorpha, human, etc. The antibodies can then be used in immunoassays for the detection of the presence of the p31 protein or p31 polymerized albumin complex or may be administered The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation All DNA manipulations were done according to standard procedures. See A cassette containing the yeast glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH promoter region, the pre S HBV region comprising 165bp encoding 55 amino acids the coding sequence for the surface antigen sAg gene in reading frame with pre surface pre S sequence and the GAPDH terminator region, was prepared by ligating the following four fragments a a 1407 These four fragments were ligated in steps as follows 4 picomoles of fragment a GAPDH promoter were ligated to 260 picomoles of phosphorylated fragment b 14bp synthetic adaptor in the presence of 10 units of T4 DNA ligase. The product fragment a b was separated from an excess of adaptor molecules by preparative gel electrophoresis. Approximately 1.5 picomole of isolated fragment a b was ligated to 1.5 picomoles of fragment c 250bp Fragment a A 1407bp A complementary DNA cDNA containing the yeast GAPDH coding sequences was prepared in the following manner see copending application Serial No. 468,589, filed February 22, 1983 A yeast gene library was prepared by inserting fragments obtained after partial digestion of total yeast DNA with restriction endonuclease A plasmid vector pHBS 56GAP347 33 , for the expression of HBV surface antigen in yeast, using the GAPDH promoter fragment was constructed. Total digestion of pGAP 347 with Plasmid pHBS56 was obtained as follows The HBsAg DNA segment of pHBS5 was excised by pADH5 was obtained as follows. A 1500bp ADH1 promoter fragment terminating at position 9 Hitzeman Fragment b A 14bp Fragment c A 250bp Fragment d An approximately 1580bp pHBS GAP347 33T contains the sAg coding region inserted between the GAPDH promoter and GAPDH terminator, with the whole expression cassette flanked by BamHI restriction sites. The GAPDH promoter and part of the sAg coding sequence was obtained from pHBS56 GAP347 33 a plasmid that contains the sAg coding region, GAPDH promoter and ADH terminator in an pHBS56 GAP347 33 was digested with pGAP2 sAg5 is a plasmid derived from pGAP2 sAg5 in which part of the 3 non coding region of the HBS gene and the coding region of GAPDH gene have been deleted. For this construction, two fragments were prepared. The first contains the vector with the GAP promoter. This fragment was obtained by digestion of pGAP2 sAg5 with pGAP2 sAg5 was constructed by cloning a fragment containing the HBsAg coding and 3 non coding regions purified from pHBS5 3 Hae2 1 into pGAP 2 . To prepare the fragment, pHBS5 3 Hae2 1 was linearized by pHBS5 3 Hae2 1 is a derivative of pHBS5 3 a plasmid that contains the HBsAg coding region and part of 3 flanking sequences , which contains more 3 non coding sequences. To prepare a fragment containing a longer HBS non coding region, the HBV genome 3.2kb was excised from pHB 3200 Valenzuela Plasmid pHBS5 3 was constructed as follows A After digesting pHBS5 with pGAP 2 is a pBR322 derived vector which contains a The plasmid pHBpreS 347 33T 1.0µg was used to transform yeast One hundred ml cultures of strain 2150 2 3 containing plasmid pHBpreS 347 33T were grown to optimum density at 65Onm of 3 in leucine minus medium. Cell free lysates were prepared by agitation with glass beads and removal of cell debris by centrifugation. HBsAg was measured by the Abbott Ausria II immunoassay and protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie blue binding method. The results are shown in Table I. They indicate that immunoreactive HBsAg material is synthesized from pHBpreS 347 33T in yields similar or larger than those obtained from pHBS GAP347 33T. Experiments using CsCl and sucrose gradient sedimentation indicate that the HBsAg containing 55 amino acids of the pre S region is assembled into particles of density similar to the known HBsAg particles. The pre S containing particles were purified by immuno affinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody against sAg. The purified particles were analyzed by protein gel electrophoresis. Results showed that the monomer of the pre S containing particle has a molecular weight of approximately 31,000 as expected for a protein of 281 amino acids. The ability of the pre S containing particles to bind human polyalbumin was investigated by a specific ELISA procedure. Polystyrene beads were coated with human polyalbumin, incubated with dilutions of the yeast cell lysates prepared as described above in 50mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and 1 BSA, incubated at 42 C for 2 hrs, washed with H₂O, incubated with Abbott guinea pig anti HBsAg peroxidase antibodies for 1 hr at 42 , washed and read at 492nm after adding As is shown in Table II, the results clearly indicate that the HBsAg particles containing the 55 amino acids of the pre S region are able to efficiently bind human polyalbumin in contrast to HBsAg particles which do not contain this region. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
