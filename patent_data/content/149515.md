# Rubber stamp.

## Abstract
A rubber stamp comprising a housing 13, 14 , a base plate 12 fixed at one end of the housing and a handle in the form of a knob 15, 16 mounted at the other end of the housing. A stamp block 24 formed by independently changeable rubber stamp elements carried by endless rubber bands 25 rotatable in the housing, protrudes through an aperture 23 in the base plate 12 . To change the stamp block, the rubber band assembly is withdrawn by axial movement of the knob 15, 16 so as to bring the stamp block within the housing, and the rubber bands are then rotated to set a new stamp block within the housing. Rotation of the rubber bands 25 is effected by respective wheels 31 acting through respective sprocket wheels 56 over which the rubber bands pass. The peripheries of the wheels 31 protrude through slots 33 in a wall of the housing. The slots 33 have recesses 36 through which a part of the periphery of the wheel can be observed carrying information indicating the particular stamp element then forming part of the stamp block.
