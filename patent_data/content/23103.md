## Description
This invention relates to novel imidazole derivatives and in particular to 2 aryl 2 hydroxy 1 1 imidazolyl alkanes and alkenes which.have antifungal activity and are useful in the treatment of fungal infections in animals, including humans. Thus according to the invention there are provided compounds ofthe formula EMI1.1 wherein R is a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl group of from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkylalkyl group of from 4 to 10 carbon atoms in which the cycloalkyl moiety contains 3 to 6 carbon atoms RÚ and Rê are each independently a hydrogen or halogen atom, or a lower alkyl or lower alkoxy group and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The terms lower alkyl and lower alkoxy as used herein refer to straight and branched chain groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Balogen means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. WhenR is a cycloalkylalkyl group, the cycloalkyl group is preferably a cyclopropyl group. R1 and R2 are preferably .. It. chlorinatoms, particularly in the 2 and 4 positions. R is preferably a C3 C6 straight or branched chain alkyl group or a C3 C4 alkenyl group particularly preferred are propyl, n butyl, isobutyl, n hexyl and allyl groups. Particularly preferred individual compounds of the invention incl ude 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 imidazolyl pentan 2 ol 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 imidazolyl hexan 2 ol 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 imidazolyl 4 methyl pentan 2 ol 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 imidazolyl octan 2 ol and 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 imidazolyl ent 4 en 2 ol. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention further provides a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or pharmaceutical composition thereof for use in treating fungal infections in animals including humans. The compounds of the formula I may be obtained by a number of different processes. In one process according to the invention they are obtained by reaction of a ketone of the formula EMI2.1 where RÚ and Rê are as previously defined, with an appropriateGrignard reagent of the formula R Mg x where X is chloro, bromo or iodo and R is as previously defined. The Grignard reagents may be prepared in an entirely conventional and well known manner by reaction of magnesium, usually in the form of magnesium turnings,. with the appropriate alkyl or alkenyl chloride, bromide or iodide, in a reaction inert organic solvent, e.g. diethyl ether. The chlorides are generally preferred because of the better yields. The reaction with the ketone 11 is again performed in a conventional manner, for example, by addition of a solution of the ketone in an inert organic solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or toluene, or mixtures thereof, to the freshly prepared Grignard reagent.The reaction is allowed to proceed at room temperature for some hours generally overnight or at reflux temperature, depending on the reactivity of the Grignard reagent. The product is then recovered in a conventional manner, e.g. by adding aqueous ammonium chloride, separating the organic phase and evaporating the solvent. The crude product may be further purified if necessary e.g. by recrystallisation or by column chromatography. In an alternative process according to a further aspect of the invention the compounds af formula I other than those whereR is branched or unsaturated on its cud carbon atom are prepared from a compound of the formula II by first reacting with trimethyloxosulphonium methylide to give the oxirane III EMI3.1 The oxirane is then reacted with a Grignard reagent as before but naturally choosing a Grignard reagent containing one methylene group less than desired for the group R in the product of formula I . The oxirane III may be prepared from a compound of the formula II by reacting with the methylide prepared from trimethyloxosulphonium iodide and sodium hydride. This reaction is generally achieved by adding powdered trimethyloxosulphonium iodide to a suspension of sodium hydride in dimethylsulphoxide and, after a yew minutes, the ketone II is added, in equimolar amount. The reaction mixture may be warmed to accelerate the reaction and after several hours at 50 80 C the product is isolated in a conventional manner e.g. by pouring into water, solvent extraction and recrystallisation. The reaction of the oxirane III with the Grignard reagent may be performed in a conventional manner as previously described for the ketone II but cuprous iodide may be added with advantage. In the case of the alkenyl derivatives of formula I wherein R is an alkenyl group, hydrogenation can be used to obtain the corresponding saturated derivative wherein R is an alkyl group.The hydrogenation reaction is conducted in conventional manner using a noble metal catalyst, e.g. platinum oxide, and is generally completed within 4 5 hours at room temperature. The product is isolated after removal of the catalyst by evaporation of the solvent and is further purified, if desired, as described above. The starting materials of formUla II are known compounds for example their preparation is described in British PatentSpecification No. 1244530. The alkyl, cycloalkylalkyl and alkenyl halides are all readily accessible compounds from which the Grignard reagents may be prepared using standard procedures. Since the compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric centres, they will of course exist in various isomeric forms. and the invention includes the individual isomers as well as the racemic mixtures. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are those formed from acids which form nontoxic acid addition salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate or bisulphate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, succinate and p toluenesulphonate salts. The salts may be obtained by conventional procedures, e.g. by mixing solutions containing equimolar amounts of the free base and desired acid, and the required salt is collected by filtration, if insoluble, or by evaporation of the solvent. The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are anti fungal agents, useful in combatting fungal infections in animals, including humans. For example they are useful in treating topical fungal infections in man caused by species of Candida, Trichophyton or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infections caused by Candida albicans e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis . They may also be used systemically in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by for example Candida albicans,Cryptococcus neoformans or Aspergillus fumigatus. The in vitro evaluation of the anti fungal activity of the compounds has been performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentation m.i.c. of the test compounds in a suitable medium at which growth of the particular micro organism fails to occur. In practice a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration are inoculated with a standard culture of for example,Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate m.i.c. value is noted. Other micro organisms used in such tests have included Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Coccidioides immitis, and Torulopsis glabrata. The following results were obtained when the compounds of the Examples were evaluated in vitro against Candida albicans. The m.i.c. recorded in the oeometrical mean of the results obtained against a panel of 12 strains of the organism.

The dose level at which the compound provides 50 protection against the lethal effect of the infection is noted. For human use, the anti fungal compounds of the invention can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents. They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, it is expected that the daily dosage level of the anti fungal compounds of the invention will be comparable with that of anti fungal agents currently in use, e.g. from 0.5 to 50 mg kg in divided doses. when administered by the parenteral routes, or from 2 to 200 mgskg in divided doses when administered by the oral route. Thus tablets or capsules of the compounds can be expected to contain from 30 mg to 1 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time orally up to 4 times a day, while dosage units for parenteral administration will contain from 10 mg to 1 g of active compound. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. Alternatively, the anti fungal compounds of formula I may be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary or they may be applied topically in the form of a cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they may be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin or they may be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10E, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required.
