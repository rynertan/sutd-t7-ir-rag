# Method and apparatus for heat recovery.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for the heat recovery from plants in which waste heat is produced at different waste heat sources and fluids are emitted at different temperatures, said method and said apparatus striving after a total optimization of the heat recovery without efficiency losses caused by missing instantaneous compensation between the amount produced waste heat and the need thereof. Said method comprising the steps of collecting waste heat in emitted fluid or fluids at every waste heat source of group of mutually similar waste heat sources and assorting said waste heat with regard to temperatures and as required accumulate it at the highest temperature as possible. Collected heat is then fed back directly or indirectly via the accumulators to the heat requiring unit the temperature need of which is with as low value as possible below the temperature of the feed back heat. Said apparatus is characterized in that said waste heat sources M1 M4 are in groups connected with heat collecting devices which by temperature controlled change over devices O1 are connected with heat accumulators A1 A3 , said heat consuming units M1, M3, M5, LU, TVV , being connected with these by means of change over devices O2 in such a way that every heat consumer is connected with the heat source the temperature of which with as low value as possible increases the temperature need in the heat consumer.
