## Description
This invention relates to a process for the production of purified plasminogen activators. More specifically, this invention relates to the production in pure form of a double chain plasminogen activator collected from a tissue cultured liquor of human normal tissue derived cells. At present, urokinase separated and purified from urine or cultured liquor of kidney cells and streptokinase collected from cultured liquor of Streptococci are plasminogen activators employed in practical use as thrombolytic agents. However, since urokinase and streptokinase possess poor affinity to fibrin, it is frequently necessary to administer them in large amounts in order to obtain the required effect on treatment. When large doses are administered, side effects such as gastro internal hemorrhage are manifested. Under such circumstances, a thrombolytic agent having thrombolyzing activity when administered in a small dose and having only a low level of side effects such as causing a gastro internal hemorrhage has been eagerly sought. In recent years, a plasminogen activator separated and purified from a tissue cultured liquor of human melanoma cells has been proposed to serve similar purposes see Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 28009 82 the term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanese patent application . However, since tumor cells are used as a starting material and these are problems with antigenicity and carcinogenicity, such a plasminogen activator cannot be presented for practical use. The present inventors have discovered, as a result of their study on various tissue cultured liquors of human normal tissue derived cells, that a substance having plasminogen activator activity different from urokinase is contained therein, and they have successfully separated and purified it see Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 51220 84 . This plasminogen activator is separated from a tissue cultured liquor of normal tissue derived cells and thus does not have the above described drawbacks of the plasminogen activator derived from melanoma cells. Thereafter, as a result of the present inventors investigations on this substance having the activity of plasminogen activator, it has been found that the substance consists of a plurality of proteins, that the substance has protein fragments consisting of a single chain and a double chain and that both of the protein fragment of a single chain structure and that of a double chain structure have the activity of plasminogen activator. In addition tissue plasminogen activators are known from Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 256, 1981, pp. 7035 7041 Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 255, 1980, pp. 3665 3672 WO A 83 03101 and EP A 99126 Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provided a novel process for the production of a purified double chain plasminogen activator, having high affinity to fibrin and exhibiting a thrombolytic effect when administered in a small dose. This invention provides a process for the production of a double chain plasminogen activator I obtained from a tissue cultured liquor of human normal tissue derived cells via a conversion of a single chain plasminogen activator II, said plasminogen activators having the following properties Figure 1 is a graph plotting the concentration against degree of thrombolysis for the single chain plasminogen activator and the double chain plasminogen activator of this invention and Figure 2 is a graph showing the amount of double chain plasminogen activator produced from the relation of a period of time for the plasmin treatment of a single chain plasminogen activator with the hydrolysis activity on a synthetic substrate and the fibrinolytic activity. The single chain plasminogen activator The double chain plasminogen activator The tissue cultured liquor of human normal tissue derived cells employed in this invention may be any of those obtained by cultivating cells capable of producing a plasminogen activator in various suitable culture media, and examples thereof include such culture media as those described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 107510 79, 107511 79, 19001 80 and 139323 80, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 5159 82. More specifically, a plasminogen activator can be produced by contacting the cells which are proliferated in a conventional manner for cultivation of animal cells e.g., as described in The overall method for separating and purifying the plasminogen activator from the cultured liquor involves steps conventionally employed in protein chemistry, for example, adsorption using carriers, ion exchange, fractional precipitation, gel filtration, electrophoresis, various types of affinity chromatography, especially those using specific antibodies, etc. They may be employed either alone or in combination. The proteinase inhibitors which can be used in the steps of tissue culturing human normal tissue derived cells, separating a plasminogen activator from a tissue cultured liquor and purifying it for the selective production of a single chain plasminogen activator include, for example, natural proteinase inhibitors such as aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor and leupeptin, and synthetic inhibitors such as FOY product of Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. , ε aminocaproic acid, trans 4 aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid. These proteinase inhibitors may be employed either alone or in combination. The amount of the proteinase inhibitors to be employed varies depending on the proteinase chosen. For example, the amount of aprotinin employed is typically from 1 KIU mℓ to 1,000 KIU mℓ, the amount of soybean trypsin inhibitor is typically from 100 ng mℓ to 1 mg mℓ and the amount of leupeptin is typically from 10 ³ M to 10 ¹ M. One example of a specific overall method for the selective production of the single chain plasminogen activator involves tissue culturing human normal tissue derived cells in the presence of aprotinin as the proteinase inhibitor, adding ammonium sulfate to the obtained tissue cultured liquor or its concentrated cultured liquor in the presence or absence of aprotinin, separating the formed precipitates, dissolving them in an ammonium thiocyanate solution containing sodium chloride and aprotinin, passing the solution through an anti urokinase Ig G Sepharose column and adsorbing the solution onto a fibrin Sepharose column. Thereafter, an eluate obtained by using arginine containing aprotinin as an eluent is further passed through an anti urokinase Ig G Sepharose column, and freeze dried. The thus obtained powder is dissolved in water and is then gel filtered using Sephadex G 150 registered trademark by Pharmacia Co. to obtain the intended single chain plasminogen activator. The selective production of the double chain plasminogen activator can be effected by converting a mixture of a single chain plasminogen activator and a double chain plasminogen activator obtained from a tissue cultured liquor of human normal tissue derived cells or the single chain plasminogen activator as obtained above into a double chain plasminogen activator. This conversion can be effected by subjecting a fraction containing the plasminogen activator from a tissue cultured liquor to an enzyme treatment or by incubating the fraction at about 10 C to about 80 C, preferably at about 20 C to about 40 C, for about 5 days to about 10 days in any step of separating and purifying a plasminogen activator. Also the conversion can be effected by subjecting the purified single chain plasminogen activator as obtained above to an enzyme treatment. The enzyme treatment is typically carried out at a temperature of about 10 C to about 45 C, preferably at a temperature of about 25 C to about 40 C, and the period of time for the enzyme treatment is typically about 5 minutes to about 3 hours. The enzyme treatment can be carried out by any methods employed in conventional enzyme reactions and includes contacting the mixture of a single chain plasminogen activator and a double chain plasminogen activator or the single chain plasminogen activator with an enzyme directly or with an immobilized enzyme. The enzymes which can be employed in this invention include, for example, plasmin, kallikrein, trypsin, activated Factor XI and Factor XII of coagulation. The amount of the enzymes to be employed varies depending on the enzyme selected. For example, the amount of plasmin employed is typically from 0.001 CU mℓ to 10 CU mℓ, that of kallikrein is typically from 1 KU mℓ to 1,000 KU mℓ and that of trypsin is typically from 2 ng mℓ to 20 µg mℓ. As the carrier for immobilizing an enzyme there can be employed any conventional carriers used for immobilizing an enzyme such as Sepharose. One example of a specific overall method for the production of the double chain plasminogen activator involves passing a tissue cultured liquor of human normal tissue derived cells or its concentrated cultured liquor through a plasmin Sepharose column, adding ammonium sulfate to the solution obtained, separating the formed precipitates, dissolving them in an ammonium thiocyanate solution containing sodium chloride, passing the solution through an anti urokinase Ig G Sepharose column and adsorbing the solution onto a fibrin Sepharose column. Thereafter, an elute obtained by using arginine as an eluent is further passed through an anti urokinase Ig G Sepharose column and freeze dried. The thus obtained powder is dissolved in water and then gel filtered using Sephadex to obtain the intended double chain plasminogen activator. There is no doubt that the thus obtained single chain plasminogen activator and double chain plasminogen activator are plasminogen activators because they do not dissolve plasminogen free fibrin but dissolve plasminogen containing fibrin. The physical and chemical properties of the single chain plasminogen activator and the double chain plasminogen activator thus obtained are described below. The titer measurement fibrinolytic activity was carried out by the following procedures this also applies to the experiments described herein below . Using an agar fibrin added plate prepared by using 95 clottable fibrinogen plasminogen content about 50 casein units g clottable protein as a starting material, the measurement was carried out by a plate method employing urokinase as the standard. A solution of the substances of this invention was diluted with a 0.067 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 8.0 containing 1 gelatine, 0.1 M sodium chloride and 0.1 sodium azide, and the concentration of the substances of this invention exhibiting the lyzing zone same as that of 10 IU mℓ of urokinase on the fibrin plate was designated as 10 U mℓ. As evident from the various properties described above, the single chain plasminogen activator and the double chain plasminogen activator are purified substances different from urokinase derived from human urine or a tissue cultured liquor of kidney cells. Thereafter, the thrombolytic activity of the single chain plasminogen activator and the double chain plasminogen activator of this invention was measured by the Chandler s loop method As a result, it was confirmed that the thrombolytic activity of the single chain plasminogen activator and the double chain plasminogen activator was 30 times as strong as that of urokinase. Therefore, the plasminogen activators are extremely useful as a thrombolytic agent which provides a strong thrombolytic effect upon administration of a small dose. The substances are preferably administered intravenously, and the dose, although varying depending on the condition of the patient, may be in the range of 50 to 1,000,000 units per day. The method for intravenous administration is preferably by injection, or it may be administered by dissolving in a transfusion medium, etc. The substances can be formulated into, e.g., an injectable preparation, for example, by mixing the substance with a conventional excipient for injection, a buffer, an isotonic agent, a filler, a stabilizer or the like, dissolving the mixture in distilled water for injection, and freeze drying and or vacuum drying the solution to obtain a drug composition which is filled in a vial for injection. Other applications of the plasminogen activator, in addition to medical use as a thrombolytic agent, are for preventing the formation of a thrombus by, for example, combining it with materials such as artificial blood vessels, artificial organs, etc., or as a diagnostic agent for thrombosis, etc. Human embryonic kidney cells were implanted in a 100 mm plastic dish at a density of 7 x 10⁴ cells mℓ, and subjected to sufficient proliferation using 10 mℓ of Medium MEM minimum essential medium obtained from Eagle containing 10 fetal calf serum as a growth medium at 37 C in air containing 5 carbon dioxide. After 5 days, the cells were washed with physiological saline, and the medium was replaced by 20 mℓ of a serum free producing medium consisting of Medium 199 obtained from Morgan containing 0.5 lactalbumin hydrolysate and 0.8 fumaric acid. After maintaining the cells in Medium 199 for 7 days, the medium was replaced by a fresh producing medium as described above, and the cultured liquor containing the substance of this invention was recovered. Human embryonic lung cells were implanted to a 500 mℓ spinner flask at a density of 10⁵ cells mℓ together with Cytodex I bead carrier for cell culture, registered trademark by Pharmacia Co. at a concentration of 2.5 mg mℓ, and suspension cultured by using 300 mℓ of Medium MEM containing 10 fetal calf serum as a growth medium at 37 C in air containing 5 carbon dioxide, while stirring at a rotation of 60 rpm. After sufficient proliferation of the cells by their cultivation for 8 days, the bead carrier to which the cells had been adhered was washed with physiological saline, and the medium was replaced by 300 mℓ of serum free Medium 199 containing 0.5 lactalbumin hydrolysate and cultivation was continued for 25 days with stirring at a rotation of 60 rpm, while the medium was replaced on every fifth day. Thus, the cultured liquor containing the substance of this invention was recovered. The procedure of Reference Example 1 was repeated except that Medium 199 containing 0.5 lactalbumin hydrolysate, 0.8 fumaric acid and 20 KIU mℓ aprotinin was used instead of the Medium 199, and a cultured liquor containing the substance of this invention was obtained. The procedure of Reference Example 2 was repeated except that Medium 199 containing 0.5 lactalbumin hydrolysate and 20 KIU mℓ aprotinin was used instead of the Medium 199, and a cultured liquor containing the substance was obtained. Ammonium sulfate was added to 32 ℓ of a human embryonic kidney tissue cultured liquor as obtained by Reference Example 1 in a proportion of 300 g ℓ, and stirred at 0 C for 2 hours. The formed precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 minutes and dissolved in a 0.02 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.5 M sodium chloride, 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, and the resulting solution was dialyzed against a solution having the same composition as the above described solution at 4 C overnight. The obtained solution containing the substance of this invention was 320 mℓ in liquid volume, and the activity of the solution was 18 U mℓ. Further, the specific activity of the solution activity per unit weight of the proteins including the substance of this invention contained therein was measured according to the method described in White W.F., This elute was dialyzed against physiological saline containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, passed through an anti urokinase Ig G Sepharose column and continuously adsorbed onto an arginine Sepharose column 1.5Φ x 8 cm . After sufficient washing with a 0.5 M sodium chloride solution containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, a 0.5 M arginine solution containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin was used to elute the substance of this invention. The obtained solution had a liquid volume of 47 mℓ, and the activity was 87 U mℓ and its specific activity was 3,500 U A280. The above obtained solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and gel filtered through a column 1.5Φ x 100 cm of Sephadex G 150 equilibrated with a 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 1.5 M sodium chloride and 0.1 Tween 80 to collect a fraction having activity. The obtained solution containing the plasminogen activator was 15 mℓ in liquid volume, and the activity was 210 U mℓ and its specific activity was 14,000 U A280. According to the analysis of the above obtained substance by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis, it was not decomposed by the reduction treatment in the presence of a buffer containing 1 dodecyl sodium sulfate, 1 β mercaptoethanol and 20 glycerine at 100 C for 5 minutes, and thus it was confirmed as the single chain structure. 1.5 ℓ of a human embryonic lung tissue cultured liquor as obtained by each of Reference Examples 2 and 4 was passed through an anti urokinase Ig G Sepharose column, and then adsorbed onto a fibrin Sepharose column 1.5Φ x 12 cm . After washing sufficiently with a 0.5 M sodium chloride solution containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, a 0.5 M arginine solution containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin was used to elute and collect 65 mℓ of a fraction containing the activity of the substance of this invention. The activity of this solution was 68 U mℓ and the specific activity was 1,020 U A280. This solution was dialyzed against physiological saline containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, then adsorbed onto a concanavalin A Sepharose column 1Φ x 25 cm , and washed with a 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 1 M sodium chloride, 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, followed by eluting the substance of this invention according to a linearly gradient elution method using the above buffer at an initial stage while continuously changing the composition of buffer to a 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.4 M methylmannoside, 2 M ammonium thiocyanate, 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin. The obtained solution was 31 mℓ in liquid volume, and the activity was 102 U mℓ and its specific activity was 6,500 U A280. After dialysis, the dialysate was concentrated by ultrafiltration and gel filtered by Sephadex G 150 to recover a 15 mℓ fraction containing activity. The activity was 161 U mℓ and the specific activity was 13,100 U A280. According to the analysis of the above obtained substance of this invention SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis, it was not decomposed by the reduction treatment in the presence of a buffer containing 1 dodecyl sodium sulfate, 1 β mercaptoethanol and 20 glycerine at 100 C for 5 minutes, and thus, it was confirmed to be of a single chain structure. From 3.4 ℓ of a human embryonic foreskin tissue cultured liquor obtained in the same manner as in Reference Example 3 were removed insolubles by centrifu galization and the obtained solution was adsorbed onto a zinc Sepharose column 4Φ x 7.5 cm equilibrated with a 0.02 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin, then washed well with a solution having the same composition as the buffer used for equilibration, and eluted with a 0.05 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.5 containing 50 mM imidazole, 0.5 M sodium chloride, 0.1 Tween 80 and 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin. The obtained solution had a liquid volume of 160 mℓ, and the activity was 80 U mℓ and its specific activity was 236 U A280. This solution was adsorbed onto a Sepharose 4B column combined with a specific antibody Ig G to the plasminogen activator obtained from a rabbit, then washed well with physiological saline, and eluted with a 0.2 M glycine HCℓ buffer pH 2.5 containing 25 KIU mℓ aprotinin. The pH of the elute was immediately raised to near neutrality and its activity was measured, wherdby a solution having a liquid volume of 200 mℓ, an activity of 116 U mℓ and a specific activity of 4,800 U A280 was obtained. This solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and subjected to the gel filtration using a Sephacryl S 200 column 1.5Φ x 100 cm equilibrated with a 0.02 M phosphate buffer containing 0.1 Tween 80 and 1 M sodium chloride to recover a fraction containing activity. The obtained solution was 15 mℓ and had an activity of 4,800 U mℓ and a specific activity of 16,000 U A280. According to the analysis of the above obtained substance of this invention by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis, it was not decomposed by the reduction treatment in the presence of a buffer containing 1 dodecyl sodium sulfate, 1 β mercaptoethanol and 20 glycerine at 100 C for 5 minutes, and thus, it was confirmed to be of a single chain structure. The single chain plasminogen activator separated and purified in Example 1 was dissolved in a 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 human serum albumin and 0.14 M sodium chloride to prepare a 250 U mℓ plasminogen activator solution. To 200 µℓ of this solution were added 300 µℓ of a plasmin solution ⁷ and the reaction was effected at 37 C and terminated after a predetermined period of time by neutralizing the plasmin activity with 200 µℓ of an aprotinin buffer added. By using 70 µℓ of the obtained solution was determined the hydrolysis activity of 0.1 mM of the synthetic substrate Boc Phe Ser Arg MCA . The results of the titer measurement of the substances of this invention before and after the plasmin treatment are shown in Figure 2. The single chain plasminogen activator was 100 converted into the double chain plasminogen activator by this plasmin treatment and a reduction in the fibrinolytic activity was not observed before and after the plasmin treatment. A mixed solution of a single chain plasminogen activator and a double chain plasminogen activator 3,000 U mℓ obtained by concentrating a human embryonic kidney tissue cultured liquor as obtained by each of Reference Examples 1 and 2 was dissolved in a 0.02 M tris HCℓ buffer containing 0.15 M sodium chloride. 2 mℓ of the obtained solution was mixed with 1 mℓ of plasmin Sepharose and the reaction was effected at 25 C for 5 hours. After the reaction, the plasmin Sepharose was separated by filtration and the content of the double chain plasminogen activator was determined from the results of measurement of the hydrolysis activity on the synthetic substrate and the reduction treatment which was carried out in the same manner as in Example 4. As a result, it was confirmed that the single chain plasminogen activator was 100 converted into the double chain plasminogen activator by the plasmin Sepharose treatment. Ammonium sulfate was added to 3.6 ℓ of a human embryonic foreskin tissue cultured liquor obtained in the same manner as in Reference Example 3 to give a 60 saturation, and stirred at 0 C for 2 hours. The formed precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 minutes and dissolved in a 0.02 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.1 Tween 80, and the resulting solution was dialyzed against a solution having the same composition as the above described solution at 4 C overnight and then incubated at 25 C for 1 week. This solution was adsorbed onto a zinc Sepharose column 2.6Φ x 6 cm and then eluted with a 0.05 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.5 containing 50 mM imidazole, 0.5 M sodium chloride and 0.1 Tween 80. The elute was 156 mℓ in liquid volume and the activity was 173 U mℓ and its specific activity was 850 U A280. This elute was diluted with a 0.02 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.6 containing 0.1 Tween by ten times and then adsorbed onto a lysine Sepharose column 1.6Φ x 6 cm equilibrated with a solution having the same composition as the buffer used for dilution and then eluted with a 0.02 M tris HCℓ buffer pH 7.6 containing 0.05 M sodium chloride, 0.5 M potassium thiocyanate, 0.1 M ε amino n caproic acid and 0.1 Tween 80. The obtained solution had a liquid volume of 20.5 mℓ, and the activity was 103 U mℓ and its specific activity was 21,000 U A280. This solution was subjected to the reduction treatment and the SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis as described in i Performance on reduction treatment and as a result, it was found that the single chain plasminogen activator was almost 100 converted into the double chain plasminogen activator. The procedure of Example 6 was repeated except that a mixed solution of the single chain plasminogen activator and the double chain plasminogen activator 3,000 U mℓ obtained by concentrating a human embryonic lung tissue cultured liquor as obtained in Reference Example 2 was employed instead of that obtained by concentrating a human embryonic kidney tissue cultured liquor as obtained by Reference Example 2. As a result, it was confirmed that the single chain plasminogen activator was 100 converted into the double chain plasminogen activator by the plasmin Sepharose treatment.
