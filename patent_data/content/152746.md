# Hybridoma cell lines and monoclonal antibodies to factor VIIIC.

## Abstract
Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies specific for polypeptide fragments derived from human Factor VIIIC are provided. Class I hybridomas produce monoclonal antibodies reactive with a 80 77 kd doublet fragment or with both the 80 77 kd doublet and a 240 kd polupeptide. Class III hybrido mas produce monoclonal antibodies reactive with the 240 kd polypeptide as well as a 92.5 kd fragment and its precursors. Class III antibodies show additional reactivity with a 40 kd thrombin digestion product. The monoclonal antibodies are useful for the separation of Factor VIIIC and its constituent polypeptides, as well as for the immunoassay of Factor VIIIC in biological samples. Cell lines 42, 47, 56 and I 28 were deposited at National Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wilts, U.K. on December 21, 1984, and granted accession nos. 84122103, 84122102, 84122104 and 84122101 respectively. Cell lines 4B5,5B1, and 2B6 were deposited at the Ameri can Type Culture Collection on December 27, 1984, and granted accession nos. HB 8688, HB 8689 and HB 8690 re spectively.
