## Description
IMPROVED PROCESS OF, AND FRAME FOR, DRAFTING FIBROUS MATERIAL This invention relates to an improved drafting frame having pairs of nipped drafting rolls between which a series of slivers of fibrous material are passed. In drafting frames of this type, pairs of aligned top and bottom drafting rolls are held together in nipped engagement under pressure as the fibrous material passes between them and the rolls are driven through appropriate gearing at a progressively faster speed so that the slivers of fibrous material are laterally spread out into the form of a thin web and so that, at the same time, the fibrous material passing between the rolls is stretched or drafted to more perfectly align the fibres longitudinally of the web. Drafting is normally carried out with successive roll pairs being set at a roll centre to centre distance slightly greater, typically 3 to 7 mm greater, than the longest fibre length. As the roll centre to centre distance increases above this value, drafting is normally believed to become uneven resulting in a non uniform product and at distances of about 1.5 times the maximum fibre length drafting cannot be established with draft ratios greater than about 4.0. The distance of 1.5 times the maximum fibre length and a draft ratio greater than about 4.0 are only approximate figures and are given as a guide the actual figures for a particular feedstock depends on the particular sliver cohesiveness . It will be realised that this imposes a limitation on the maximum roll diameter that can be used and this, in turn, leads to difficulties because the rolls bow under the static and dynamic deflection forces which are imposed on the rolls. For example, it is estimated that in a typical drafting process a 100 mm diameter, 1.6 m wide, roll will bow 0.3 mm and a 100 mm diameter, 3.0 m wide, roll will bow 4.00 mm. It is believed that it would be difficult to achieve sufficiently uniform nip pressures for the drafting process at wide widths even with the use of crowned rolls. Also in United States Patent Serial No 3 553 792 is described a drafting frame in which the static and dynamic deflection forces on each drafting roll are counter balanced by providing each roll with one or more supporting rolls spaced about the periphery of the drafting roll. Surprisingly we have now found that under certain conditions the roll to roll distance is not critical when drafting multi ends of fibrous sliver packed in close proximity.Thus the distance between the roll centres of successive roll pairs can exceed 1.5 times. the maximum fibre length so allowing much larger diameter rolls to be used so reducing the amount of bowing at wide widths whilst producing a uniform highly oriented web. According to the present invention we provide a process of drafting a fibrous material comprising continuously passing a series of slivers of the fibrous material in turn through a nip formed between a first pair of rotating rolls and then through a nip formed between a second pair of rotating rolls, a draft ratio being maintained between the first and second pairs of rotating rolls, heating the fibrous web so formed and passing it through the nip formed between a further pair of rotating rolls characterised in that the distance between the nip formed between the first pair of rolls and the nip formed between the second pair of rolls is in excess of 1.5 times the maximum fibre length in the slivers. According to a first embodiment of the present invention we provide a process of drafting a fibrous material comprising continuously passing a series of slivers of the fibrous material in turn through a nip formed between a first pair of rotating rolls and then through a nip formed between a second pair of rotating rolls, a draft ratio being maintained between the first and second pairs of rotating rolls, heating the fibrous web so formed and passing it through the nip formed between a further pair of rotating rolls, and progressively increasing the speed of rotation of the second and successive pairs of rotating rolls thereby progressively establishing a higher draft ratio between the first and second pairs of rotating rolls. In the process we prefer that the draft ratio initially maintained between the first and second pairs of rotating rolls does not exceed 1.1. However, with some feedstocks with high sliver cohesiveness initial draft ratios as high as 2.0 or even 5.0 may be maintained. The speed of rotation of the second pair of rotating rolls is increased progressively to a value dependent on the input sliver weight and the required final web weight. The shim after leaving the nip formed by the second pair of rotating rolls, and before being subjected to the heating step, may be passed in turn through the nips formed between a number of, say two, intermediate pairs of rotating rolls. It should be realised that, where the fibrous web is passed in turn through intermediate rolls in this way then, in the usual manner, a low draft ratio will require to be maintained between successive pairs of the intermediate rotating rolls. Also in the process, the fibrous shim, immediately after being heated, will usually be passed over a guide bar which allows the heat to be applied very close to the roll pair exit. We also provide a drafting frame comprising in series a first pair, second pair and third pair of aligned rotatable rolls each forming a nip, means for passing a series of slivers of a fibrous material into the nip formed between the first pair of rotatable rolls, means for rotating the first pair of rotatable rolls, means for rotating the second and third pairs of rotatable rolls which allows a speed differential to be maintained between the second and third pairs of rotatable rolls, means for progressively increasing the speed of rotation of the second pair of rotatable rolls, and simultaneously the third pair of rotatable rolls, in relation to the first pair of rotatable rolls so as to progressively increase the draft ratio between the first and second pairs of rotatable rolls and heating means located between the second and third pairs of rotatable rolls. We further provide a drafting frame comprising in series a first pairi second pair, a plurality of intermediate pairs and a third pair of aligned rotatable rolls each forming a nip, means for passing a series of slivers of a fibrous material into the nip formed between the first pair of rotatable rolls, common means for rotating the remaining pairs of rolls which allows a speed differential to be maintained between successive pairs of the remaining pairs of rolls, means for progressively increasing the speed of rotation of the remaining pairs of rolls in relation to the first pair of rotatable rolls so as to progressively increase the draft ratio between the first and second pairs of rotatable rolls and heating means located between the last of the intermediate pairs of rolls and the third pair of rolls. Conveniently the slivers of fibrous material are passed into the nip formed by the first pair of rolls by means of a suitable spacing means followed by suitable tensioning means.The spacing means is used to provide a tightly packed uniform feedstock over the full machine width. The tightly packed uniform feedstock can be obtained, for example, by using a 3 gram metre sliver spaced at 1 cm centres across the width of the drafting rolls. The first pair of rotatable rolls may be driven by any suitable means, for example, an electric motor gear box or a hydraulic motor. The second, intermediate if provided and third pair of rotatable rolls may be driven by either an electric or hydraulic motor, which includes a suitable gearing mechanism in order that an appropriate draft ratio can be maintained between the second, intermediate if provided and third pairs of rotatable rolls. We have already said that the drafting frame includes a means for progressively increasing the speed of rotation of the second pair, third pair and, if provided, intermediate pairs of rotatable rolls in relation to the first pair of rolls. This may consist of any electronic means of increasing the speed up to the maximum draft ratio required over a period of approximately 15 to 30 seconds. Furthermore the frame may be provided with a guide bar between the heating means and the third pair of rolls. Alternatively the third pair of rolls may be vertically displaced in relation to the previous pair of rolls so eliminating the need for a guide bar.The rolls used in the drafting frame may have a smooth, for example, rubber coated surface or, where greater friction on the fibrous material is required, a profiled, for example, a fluted, surface. In most cases it is desirable to use a combination of the two. The heating step in the process may be achieved by passing the fibrous web through a stream of hot air. According to a second embodiment of the invention we provide a process of drafting a fibrous material comprising continuously passing a series of slivers of the fibrous material in turn through a tram of nips formed between pairs of rotating rolls, the draft ratio between successive pairs of rolls in the train being less than 5.0 and the overall draft ratio between the first and last pairs of rolls in the train being greater than 10.0, heating the web so formed and then passing it through the nip formed by a further pair of rotating rolls. We further provide a drafting frame comprising in series a train of pairs of aligned rotatable rolls each forming a nip, a heating means and another pair of aligned rotatable rolls forming a nip, means for passing a series of slivers of a fibrous material into the nip formed between the first pair of rolls in the train, means, including gearing means, for rotating all of the pairs of rolls in the train so that a draft of less than 5.0 can be maintained between successive pairs of rolls in the train and an overall draft ratio greater than 10.0 can be maintained between the first and last pairs of rolls in the train. The draft ratio between successive pairs of rolls in the train can be less than 2.0 or as low as 1.1 depending on the feedstock used. The draft ratio between successive pairs of rolls in the train may be the same or a different value. Furthermore in certain cases it may be desirable for the overall draft ratio between the first and last pairs of rolls in the train to be much higher than 10.0 for example. The rolls in the train may be driven by either an electric or hydraulic motor provided with a suitable gearing mechanism which allows suitable draft ratios to be maintained between successive pairs of rolls in the train. The other pair of rolls through which the web is finally passed may be driven either independently of, or through gearing from, the drive used for the rolls in the train. The rolls used may have a smooth, for example rubber coated, surface or, where greater friction on the fibrous material is required, a profiled, for example fluted, surface. Desirably one of the pair of rolls, is rubber coated and the other of the same pair of rolls, is fluted. Conveniently the slivers of fibrous material are passed, in this embodiment of the invention, into the nip formed by the first pair of rolls in the train by means of a suitable spacing means followed by a suitable tensioning means. The spacing means used provides a tightly packed uniform feedstock over the full width of the machine. After the web has been heated it is usually passed around a guide bar before it is passed through the nip formed by the other pair of rolls. Alternatively the same effect can be achieved by vertically displacing the other pair of rolls from the horizontal line followed by the train of nips. For convenience the web is heated by hot air. Throughout this specification we have frequently used the term draft ratio which, though already well known in the art, means the ratio of the speeds of successive pairs of rolls forming nips through which slivers of a fibrous material are passed in order to achieve drafting of the fibrous material. In general the fibrous material will be passed successively between pairs of rolls rotating at a progressively faster speed. The required draft ratios required to produce a particular web weight can be determined by the following formulae 1 Overall draft ratio number of ends of sliver x sliver weight Z m web weight gglinear metre 2 draft ratio before web is heated overall draft ratio x 100 100 overfeed where overall draft ratio is the ratio of the speed of roll following the heater to the speed of the first roll and 96 overfeed V2 3 V 3 V2 where V2 is the speed of the roll pair immediately before the heater and V3 is the speed of the roll pair immediately after the heater.
