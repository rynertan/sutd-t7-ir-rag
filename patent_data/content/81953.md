# Tool for preparing coaxial cable and for positioning and connection of coaxial connector therewith.

## Abstract
A tool T, TA comprises clamping members 28, 128 that clampingly engage a coaxial cable 10 . Drill blocks 38, 138, 139 are secured together onto a plate 24, 124 to which the clamping members are secured and they include opposing holes 44, 50 centrally disposed relative to the clamped cable to enable a drill 50, 156 to pass therethrough to drill opposed openings 56 through the jacket 14 and shielding 16, 18 and into the dielectric sheathing 20 around the center conductor 22 , whereafter the drill blocks 38, 138, 139 are removed. A housing of a coaxial connector 12 containing stationary and movable signal probes 58, 60 is mounted on the plate 24, 124 to position the signal probes 58, 60 relative to the drilled holes 56 whereafter the movable signal probe 60 is moved into electrical connection with the center conductor 22 and ground conductor members 70 penetrate the jacket 14 and electrically connect with the shielding 16, 18 .
