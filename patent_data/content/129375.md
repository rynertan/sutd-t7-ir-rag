# A METHOD FOR STABILIZING BOXLESS MOLDS

## Abstract
To mutually stabilize two connecting, boxless mold parts 1, 2 of sand or a similar material, a cavity 7 with stable walls is provided adjacent to both mold parts, and a flowable filling material is added into this cavity for mutual fixation of the walls and thus exclusion of shifting of the mold parts in rela tion to each other.
