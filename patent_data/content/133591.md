## Abstract
C₂ C₄ paraffins are converted into aromatic gasoline over a catalyst composition comprising gallium supported on a carrier and a crystalline metal silicate with a special crystal structure, which composition has been subjected once or several times to a two stage treatment comprising reduction at a temperature of 400 650 C and oxidation at a temperature of 350 700 C.
