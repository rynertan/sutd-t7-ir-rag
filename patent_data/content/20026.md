# Solvent extraction apparatus and process.

## Abstract
A liquid liquid solvent extraction system comprises a mixing stage which includes a mixing device 10 for creating a dispersion of the two liquid phases followed by a residence chamber 14 designed to enhance contacting and mass transfer between the solute and solvent phases. The separating stage includes a drop size conditioning device 15 which establishes a drop size in the discontinuous liquid phase of the dispersion which can be easily separated from the continuous liquid phase in the succeeding settling device 16 . The conditioning device 15 also acts to reduce entrainment of the solvent phase in the solute phase during separation of the phases. The settling device 16 may contain a series of baffles to reduce the time required for phase separation and to reduce entrainment of the solvent phase in the solute phase. The system is used to extract metal ions such as uranium, copper, cobalt, nickel, and vanadium from aqueous process streams containing dilute concentrations of such ions. Hydrocarbon solvents which are partially or totally immiscible in water are used to extract the metal ions and may contain additives such as complexforming agents to aid in the mass transfer of metal ions to the solvent phase. After contacting and separation of the phases, the metal ions are recovered from the hydrocarbon solvent.
