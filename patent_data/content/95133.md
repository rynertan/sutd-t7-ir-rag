## Description
PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS OR MIXTURES THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a method of preparing polyprenyl compounds or mixtures thereof. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of preparing polyprenols or esters thereof, or mixtures thereof, which have trans and cis configurations similar to those of dolichol and are useful as advantageous starting materials for the synthesis of dolichol.Description of the Prior Art Dolichol was first isolated in 1960 from the human kidney and such animal organs as ox kidney, pig kidney, pig heart, pig liver and rat liver by J. F. Pennock et al see Nature London , 186, 470 1960 . Later, it was elucidated that dolichol is a mixture of polyprenol homologs having the general formula EMI1.1 EMI1.2 tb SEP CH3 tb SEP l tb wherein SEP CH, C C CH, SEP tb SEP H,C SEP H SEP H tb SEP 31 SEP 1 tb and SEP CH2 C C CH2 SEP repr tb A represents a trans isoprene unit, esents a cis isoprene unit the same definitions being consistently applied throughout the present text. The number of cis isoprene units is generally between 12 to 18 and the three homologs in Which 2 is 14, 15 and 16 are present in major proportions R. W.Keenan et al.,Biochemical Journal, 165, 405 1977 . It is also known that dolichol is widely distributed in mammals, and performs a very important function in sustaining the lives of organisms. For example, J. B. Harford et al.demonstrated by in vitro tests using the calf or pig brain white matter that exogenous dolichol enhances incorporation of carbohydrates such as mannose into lipid, and consequently increases the formation of glycoproteins which are important for maintaining the liVes of organisms Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 76, 1036 1977 . Since the effect of dolichol to incorporate carbohydrates into lipid is remarkable in mature animals as compared with those in the actively growing stage, the action of dolichol has attracted attention for its possible retarding or prevention of aging. R. W. Keenan et al. state that it is important for organisms which rapidly keep growing, for example, those in the infant stage, to take dolichol extraneously such as to supplement the dolichol produced by biosynthesis within their own body Archives of Biochemistry andBiophysics, 179, 634 1977 . Akamatsu et al. determined the quantity of dolichol phosphate in the regenerated liver of a rat and found that the quantity determined is much smaller than that in normal liver and the function of the liver tissues to synthesize glycoproteins is drastically reduced and that the addition of exogenous dolichol phosphate improves the reduced function of glycoprotein synthesis reported at the 1981 Conference of the Japanese Society of Biochemistry . Thus, dolichol is a very important substance for living organisms, and it is strongly desired to develop its use as a medicine or as an inteeeediate for the production of medicines, cosmetics, etc. However, since dolichol has hitherto been difficult to obtain, sufficient research work. has been impossible.For example, only about 0.6 g at most of dolichol can be obtained from 10 kg of pig liver through complicated separating procedures see J. Burgos et al., BiochemicalJournal, 88, 470 1963 . On the other hand, it is extremely difficult by present day techniques of organic synthesis to produce dolichol by a wholly synthetic process, as can be seen in the light of the complex and unique molecular structure thereof. It is to date known that polyprenol compounds can be extracted from various plants, and so far, the following polyprenols have been successfully extracted 1 SolanesolEMI3.1 2 FicaprenolsEMI3.2 x 5 9 3 BetulaprenolsEMI3.3 y 4 6 Betulaprenols have a structure similar to dolichols in that a group of two trans isoprene units is connected to the omega terminal isoprene unit and then a group of cis isoprene units follows. However, the betulaprenols so far known contain up to six cis isoprene units at most, and in order to synthesize dolichols containing homologs having 14, 15 and 16 cis isoprene units respectively as major components from these betulaprenols, it is necessary to link at least 8 isoprene units while maintaining them in cis form. This procedure is almost impossible by the present day organic synthetic techniques. K. Hannus et al. reported that a polyisoprenyl fraction in an amount of about 1 dry weight was isolated from the needles of Pinus sylvestris and the fraction cpnsisted of polyisoprenyl acetates with 10 to 19 isoprene units predominantly in the cis configuration Phytochemistry, 13, 2563 1974 . However, their report does not explain the details of the trans and cis configurations in said polyprenyl acetates. Furthermore, according to a report of D. F. Zinkel et al., a C90 polyprenol containing 18 isoprene units or a homologous series of polyprenols averaging 18 isoprene units is present in Pinus strobus needle extracts cf. Phytochemistry, 11, 3387 1972 . However, this report does not contain any detailed analysis of the trans and cis configurations in said polyprenol. Some of the present inventors, together with their colleagues, previously found that extraction of the leaves of Ginkgo biloba and Cedrus deodara followed by an adequate separation procedure, such as chromatography or fractional dissolution, if necessary following hydrolysis, gives a polyprenyl fraction composed of a mixture of polyprenols and or acetate S thereof which contain 14 22 isoprene units in quite the same trans cis configurations as in mammalian dolichols and that said polyprenyl fraction is very similar in the chain length d distribution of polyprenyl homologs to mammalian dolichols, the only difference being the absence in said fraction of the alpha terminal saturated isoprene unit and that said polyprenyl fraction, if desired, can be separated relatively easily into the individual constituent polyprenyl homologs each being homogeneous with respect to the number of isoprene units , and proposed a method of producing dolichols or precursors thereof which comprises reacting such polyprenyl compound or fraction or a reactive derivative thereof with a Grignard reagent or lithium compound derived from a 4 hydroxy 2 methylbutyl halide or a functional precursor thereof EP 0 054 753 Al published on June 30, 1982 . However, the recovery of the above mentioned polyprenyl fraction from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba andCedrus deodara is limited regionally as well as quantitatively from the natural resource viewpoint. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a method of obtaining polyprenyl compounds or mixtures thereof, which are usable as advantageous starting materials in the synthesis of dolichol, from plants other than the above mentioned Ginkgo biloba and Cedrus deodara. Other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly, it has now been found that a polyprenyl fraction relatively rich in polyprenols and or polyprenyl acetates having the same trans and cis configurations as those of dolichol and containing 14 to 16 cis isoprene units can be obtained from the leaves of the plants belonging to the family Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae,Sciadopitydaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cephalotaxaceae,Araucariaceae or Taxaceae, that, if desired, said polyprenyl fraction can be separated relatively easily into individual constituent polyprenyl homologs, and that said polyprenyl fraction and the individual polyprenyl homologs isolated therefrom are suited for use as intermediates in the synthesis of mammalian dolichol. Thus, the present invention provides a method of preparing polyprenyl compounds or mixtures thereof represented by the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein A is a hydroxyl group or an acyloxy group, EMI6.1 represents a trans isoprene unit, represents a cis isoprene unit and n is an integer of 10 to 22, preferably 12 18, which comprises extracting leaves of a plant belonging to the familyCupressaceae, Taxodiaceae, Sciadopitydaceae,Podocarpaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Araucariaceae or Taxaceae with an organic solvent and isolating a polyprenyl compound or a mixture of polyprenyl compounds from the extract, if necessary following or followed by subjecting the extract or the isolated compound or mixture to one or more reactions selected from among hydrolysis, esterification and transesterification. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The plants of the families Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae,Sciadopitydaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cephalotaxaceae,Araucariaceae and Taxaceae, which are used as the starting materials in the practice of the present invention, are plants belonging to the order Coniferales of the classConiferopsida of the sub division Gym ospermae of the division Spermatophyta. Hereinafter said plants are sometimes referred to as starting plants for short. The plants of the family Cupressaceae are widely distributed on the earth and said family is divided into 19 genera and about 130 species.Examples of the plants of the family Cupressaceae, which can be used as the starting plants, include Calocedrus decurrens,Chamaecyparis obtusa Japanese cypress , Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Cupressus torulosa, Cupressus sempervirens, Cupressus funebris,Juniperus chinensis Chinese juniper , Juniperus communis common juniper , Juniperus rigida, Juniperus horizontalis, Juniperus oxycedrus, Juniperus ashei, Juniperus occidental is, Juniperus virginiana, Thuja standishii, Thuja occidentalis, Thuja plicata andThujopsis dolabrata var. dolabrata. Among them, plants of the genus Chamaecyparis, such as Chamaecyparis obtusa, and plants of the genus Juniperus, such asJuniperus chinensis and Juniperus rigida, are preferably used. The plants of the family Taxodiaceae are widely distributed in the temperate zone in the northern hemisphere, especially in China, and said family is divided into 9 genera and 15 species. Examples of the plants of the family Taxodiaceae, which can be used as the starting plants, include Cryptomeria japonica Japanese cedar , Cunninghamia lanceolata, Glyptostrobus pensilis, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Sequoia sempervirens, Sequoiadendron giganteum, Taiwania cryptomerioides and Taxodium distichum. Among them preferably used are plants of the genus Cryptomeria, such as Cryptomeria japonica, and the plant of the genusMetasequoia, namely Metasequoia glyptostroboides. The family Sciadopitydaceae comprises only one genus,Sciadopitys, which in turn includes only one species, namelySciadopitys verticillata parasol fir . This plant is found mainly in Japan. The plants of the family Podocarpaceae are distributed mainly in the temperate zone in the southern hemisphere as well as in the subtropical zones, and said family is divided into 11 genera and about 125 species.Examples of the plants of the family Podocarpaceae, which can be used as the starting plants, includePodocarpus macrophylla podocarp , Podocarpus nagi,Podocarpus nivalis, Podocarpus hallii, Podocarpus lawrencii, Podocarpus neriifolius and Phyllocladus hypophyllus. Preferable among them are plants of the genus Podocarpus, such as Podocarpus macrophylla andPodocarpus nagi. The plants of the family Cephalotaxaceae are distributed mainly in East Asia. Said family comprises only one genus, Cephalotaxus, which is divided into 6 species, and plants of this genus, such as Cephalotaxus harringtonia subsp. nana, are preferably used. The plants of the family Araucariaceae are distributed mainly in the subtropical zones and in the temperate zone in the southern hemisphere. This family is divided into two genera, namely Agathis and Araucaria, and 38 species. Examples of the plants of the familyAraucariaceae, which can be used as the starting plants, include Agathis australis, Agathis dammara, Agathis labillardieri, Araucaria brasiliana, Araucaria araucana,Araucaria angustifolia, Araucaria cunninghamii andAraucaria heterophylla. Among them, Araucaria brasiliana is preferably used, for instance. The plants of family Taxaceae are distributed widely in the northern hemisphere and said family is divided into 5 genera and 20 species. As typical examples of the plants of this family, there may be mentioned Taxus cuspidata, Taxus baccata yew and Torreya nucifera Japanese nutmeg . Among them, plant of the genusTaxus, such as Taxus cuspidata, and plants of the genusTorreya, such as Torreya nucifera, are preferably used. If desired, mixed leaves from two or more of the above mentioned starting plants may be subjected to extraction in practicing the present invention. The leaves to be treated according to this invention may be used undried or after drying. Generally, the dried leaves are preferred. The degree of drying of the leaves should advantageously correspond to a water content, based on the weight of the dried leaves, of less than about 30 , preferably less than about 10 . Preferably, the leaves are extracted after crushing. This increases the area of contact with the extracting solvent, and results in an increased efficiency of extraction. The polyprenyl homologs of formula I are contained in fairly high concentrations generally in the form of a free alcohol and or acetic acid ester. In order to extract the polyprenyl homologs from the leaves of these plants effectively, the use of oil soluble organic solvents capable of well dissolving the polyprenyl homologs is convenient. Suitable oil soluble organic solvents that can be used in practicing this invention have a dielectric constant E of not more than 32.7, preferably not more than 25.0, more preferably not more than 20.7.Specifically, solvents such as exemplified below are used either singly or as a mixture of two or more. a Hydrocarbons such as petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene and xylene. b Halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethane, perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene. c Esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate. d Ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. e Ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and diisopropyl ketone. f Alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol and butyl alcohol. The solvent should desirably be capable of extracting the desired polyprenyl compounds of formula I selectively with a high efficiency, while permitting minimization of extraction of other substances. From this standpoint, the hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, esters, and ethers having low polarity such as diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether, and ketones are especially suitable among the above exemplified solvents. The amount of the extracting solvent is not critical, and can be varied widely depending upon the type of the solvent, the type or condition of the leaves to be extracted, etc. Generally, it is advantageous that the solvent is used in an amount of about 1 to about 100 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 50 parts by weight, more preferably 10 to 30 parts by weight, per part based on the dry weight of the leaves. The extraction can be carried out by dipping the leaves in the solvent, and if required, stirring the mixture continuously or intermittently. The temperature during the extraction is not critical, but can be varied widely depending upon the extraction conditions such as the type or amount of the solvent used. Generally, the extraction temperature is from about OOC to the refluxing temperature of the solvent. Usually, room temperature suffices. Under these conditions, the extraction should advantageously be carried out for a period of 1 to 10 days. After the extracting treatment, the leaves and other solid components are removed from the zapping solution and if required, the solvent is removed to give a concentrate. The extract is subjected to a separating step consisting of one or more of chromatography, fractional dissolution, fractional refrigerating precipitation and molecular distillation, whereby the desired polyprenyl fraction is recovered. In the separating step, the formation of the fraction of polyprenyl compounds can be confirmed by determining whether a spot exists at an Rf value of from 0.18 to 0.25 when A in formula I represents a hydroxyl group and or from 0.50 to 0.55 lwhen A in formula I represents an acetyloxy group in thin layer chromatography which is cried out on a TLC plate of Merck Co. precoated with silica gel 60F254 to a layer thickness of 0.25 mm with a mixture of n hexane and ethyl acetate in a volume ratio of 9 1 as a developing solvent developed 10 cm under such conditions that solanesyl acetate as a standard substance shows an Rf value of from 0.40 to 0.45 in the thin layer chromatography.It should be understood that in the following description, the Rf values of thin layer chromatography denote those which are measured under the aforesaid conditions unless otherwise specified. The operations of the chromatography, fractional dissolution, fractional refrigerating precipitation and molecular distillation used in the step of separating the aforesaid extract are known per se, and in the present invention, too, these methods can be carried out in accordance with known procedures. For the details of these methods, literature references will be cited in lieu of describing them at length. Only those items which need special care will be described below. A Chromatography For details, reference may be made to H. Heftman, Chromatography , Reinhold Publishing Co., New York 1961 . When the amount of the extract is small, thin layer chromatography or liquid chromatography is suitable. For treatment of a large amount of the extract, column chromatography is suitable. Examples of suitable chromatographic carriers are silica gel, alumina, Florisil, Celite, activated carbon, and cellulose. Silica gel is especially preferred. Examples of the developing solvent usable in the separating operation on a silica gel column include hexane ethyl acetate volume ratio from 98 2 to 80 20 , hexane diisopropyl ether volume ratio from 95 5 to 80 20 , petroleum ether methyl acetate volume ratio from 98 2 to 80 20 , petroleum ether isopropyl alcohol volume ratio from 99 1 to 90 10 , benzene diethyl ether volume ratio from 95 5 to 80 20 , benzene ethyl acetate volume ratio from 98 2 to 80 20 , and chloroform. B Fractional dissolution For details, reference may be made to L. C. Craig, Technique of Organic Chemistry , Vol. 3, Interscience 1951 . The polyprenyl compounds of formula I are easily soluble in non polar solvents such as pentane and hexane, and are sparingly soluble in polar solvents such as methanol or water. Hence, the polyprenyl compounds of formula I can be purified by the fractional dissolving method utilizing differences in solubility in these solvents. For example, a crude product such as a concentrate of the extract is dissolved in the aforesaid nonpolar solvent, and then washed with a polar solvent which is immiscible with the nonpolar solvent, whereby impurities easily soluble in the polar solvent can be drastically removed. Suitable nonpolar solvents for use in this method are, for example, hydrocarbons such as petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene and toluene and halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and chloroform.Suitable polar solvents immiscible with such nonpolar solvents are, for example, water and methanol. C Fractional refrigerating precipitation For details, reference may be made to E. W. Berg, Physical and Chemical Methods of Separation , Chapters 14 and 15, McGraw Hill, New York 1963 . The polyprenyl compounds of formula I solidify at about lO0C or less. Hence, the polyprenyl compounds of formula I can be purified by allowing the extract to stand at a temperature of not more than 10 C, preferably 15 to 300C, to solidify the desired compounds, and removing the impurities which do not solidify at these temperatures by a solid liquid separating technique. The polyprenyl compounds, however, do not have good crystallinity and become a waxy solid. Accordingly, they are difficult to purify completely by this method alone.Preferably, therefore, this method is used in combination with another purifying method. D Molecular distillation For details, reference may be made to G. Burrows, Molecular Distillation , Clarendon Press, Oxford 1960 . Since the compounds of formula I have a high molecular weight, they can be separated from low molecularweight impurities by the molecular distillation method.For example, the extract is subjected to molecular distillation at 100 to 2500C under a vacuum of 10 3 to 10 mmHg to divide it into a low molecular weight fraction and a high molecular weight fraction. The desired compounds are retained in the high molecular weight fraction, and the low molecular weight impurities can be removed effectively. When a sufficiently pure polyprenyl fraction cannot be obtained by any of these separating methods, two or more of these separating methods may be used in combination. For example, there can be used a combination of chromatography and fractional dissolution, a combination of chromatography, fractional refrigerating precipitation and fractional dissolution, a combination of chromatography, fractional refrigerating precipitation, fractional dissolution and molecular distillation, a combination of chromatography, molecular distillation and fractional dissolution, a combination of chromatography and molecular distillation, a combination of molecular distillation and fractional dissolution, and a combination of molecular distillation, fractional dissolution and fractional refrigerating precipitation. As a result of the separating step, a fraction having an Rf value of from 0.18 to 0.25, and or from 0.50 to 0.55 in thin layer chromatography can be isolated and recovered. The fraction having an Rf value of 0.18 to 0.25 consists essentially of a mixture of homologs of formula I in which A represents a hydroxyl group, and the fraction having an Rf value of from 0.50 to 0.55 consists essentially of homologs of formula I in which A represents an acetyloxy group. The polyprenyl fraction thus obtained can, if necessary, be subjected to liquid chromatography or column chromatogragphy, for instance, so that a fraction consisting of those homologs that are adequate with respect to the number of cis isoprene units can be obtained with other homologs being cut off.Said fraction can also be separated into the individual homologs by subjecting it further, for example, to high performance liquid chromatography. Prior to subjecting the extract to the aforesaid separating operation, the extract may be hydrolyzed as required to convert homologs of formula I in which A represents an acetyloxy group into homologs of formula I in which A represents a hydroxyl group. Of course, the hydrolysis may also be carried out on a fraction having anRf value of 0.50 to 0.55 obtained by the separating operation. The hydrolysis can be perfcrmed by any usual methods known for the hydrolysis of known fatty acid esters.For example, about 5 to about 50 parts by weight of the extract or the fraction is added to 100 parts by weight of a solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in aqueous methanol or ethanol the alkali metal hydroxide concentration being preferably about 0.1 to 30 by weight , and the reaction is effected at about 25 to 900C for about 0.5 to 5 hours. Referring to the polyprenyl fraction separated and recovered by the method described hereinabove, the fraction having an Rf value of 0.18 to 0.25 consists essentially of a mixture of polyprenol homologs in which A represents a hydroxyl group, and the fraction having anRf value of 0.50 to 0.55 consists essentially of a mixture of polyprenyl acetate homologs of formula I in which A represents an acetyloxy group. The ratio of the former to the latter in the extract is generally in the range of from about 20 1 to about 1 1000. The distribution pattern for the polyprenol or polyprenyl acetate homologs in each fraction varies to some extent depending on the kind of the starting plant.The distribution pattern remains almost the same for starting plants of the same species without depending on such factors as the age of the leaves used as the raw material and the time and place of collection of the leaves. In deriving mammalian dolichols from a polyprenyl fraction prepared by the method of the present invention, said fraction may be used as such or, if necessary, said fraction may be deprived of those homologs which are unnecessary for the synthesis of dolichols equivalent in the number of cis isoprene units to natural dolichols and then subjected to dolichol synthesis or said fraction may be separated into individual constituent polyprenyl compounds for subjecting adequate ones alone to dolichol synthesis.Furthermore, said fraction or each isolated polyprenyl compound may be subjected to hydrolysis, esterification or transesterification or a combination of two or more of these reactions depending on whether it is in the form of free alcohol or acetate, for conversion of polyprenols to polyprenyl esters or conversion of polyprenyl acetates to other polyprenyl esters of general formula I or to polyprenols. Examples of the polyprenyl ester of general formula I which can be produced by the method of the invention are, when A in general formula I is represented by RCOO , those esters in which R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, ethyl, npropyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, tert butyl, n penthyl, isoamyl, n hexyl, n octyl, n decyl, n undecyl, n dodecyl, stearyl , an alkenyl group containing 2 to 18 carbon atoms e.g. 3 butenyl, 3 pentenyl, 4 pentenyl, geranyl, geranylmethyl, farnesyl, farnesylmethyl , a cycloalkyl group containing 5 to 7 carbon atoms e.g.cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, cycloheptyl , an aryl group containing 6 to 10 carbon atoms e.g. phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl , an aralkyl group containing 7 to 11 carbon atoms e.g. benzyl, phenethyl, methylbenzyl, dimethylbenzyl, alpha or beta naphthylmethyl or a methyl group substituted by 1 to 3 fluorine or chlorine atoms e.g. monofluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, monochloromethyl, dichloromethyl . The esterification or transesterification of a polyprenol or polyprenol mixture represented by general formula I for the production of the abovementioned polyprenyl ester or polyprenyl ester mixture can be carried out in the same manner and under the same conditions as in the per se known esterification or transesterification reactions for the production of esters.Thus, for example, the esterification can be easily attained by mixing a polyprenol or polyprenol mixture represented by general formula I with a carboxylic acid as desired, such as formic acid, acetic acid, monofluoroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linolic acid, linoleic acid, farnesylic acid, farnesylacetic acid, benzoic acid, 3,5 dimethylbenzoic acid or 4 ethyl benzoic acid, or an acid halide or acid anhydride thereof in the presence or absence of an esterification catalyst and of a solvent, if necessary with or followed by heating and or stirring.In a preferred embodiment, the above polyprenol or polyprenol mixture is dissolved in a solvent such as hexane, benzene, methylene chloride, chloroform or diethyl ether, the acid halide mentioned above is added in an amount of 1 to 5 moles per mole of the polyprenol and the resulting mixture is stirred in the presence of 1 to 5 moles of pyridine per mole of the polyprenol at an adequate temperature in the range of from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent for 1 to 24 hours. The transesterification is carried out by reacting a polyprenol or polyprenol mixture represented by general formula I with a lower alkyl ester e.g. methyl ester, ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid as desired for instance, one of the carboxylic acids mentioned above optionally in the presence of a transesterification catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the above polyprenol or polyprenol mixture and a desired carboxylic acid ester are dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, sodium hydride is added in an amount of 0.01 to 0.1 mole per mole of the polyprenol and the resulting mixture is ref fluxed for a period of 2 hours to 5 days. The polyprenyl compounds or mixtures thereof represented by general formula I as obtained by the method of the invention are easily converted to mammalian dolichols, for example by the following routes EMI17.1 tb SEP Haloge SEP MgBr tb SEP nation tb SEP OH SEP K SEP Mwoz tb SEP OH SEP X SEP SEP Oz tb SEP Il SEP I SEP III tb SEP Hydro SEP Esterifi tb SEP lysis SEP cation SEP SEP Removal SEP of tb SEP protective tb SEP group tb SEP MM Br SEP group tb Q SEP 4 SEP SEP tb SEP Q SEP OCOR SEP Cu SEP salt SEP MM SEP OH tb In the above schema, X is a halogen atom, preferably C1 or Br, Z is a hydroxyl protecting group, such as, for example, tetrahydropyranyl, methoxymethyl or benzyl, OCOR is an acyloxy group and Q ia a group of the formulaEMI18.1 wherein n is as defined for general formula I . The polyprenyl compounds and mixtures thereof obtainable by the method of the present invention are also useful, for instance, as cosmetic bases or ointment bases or as the raw materials for the production thereof. The following nonlimitative examples illustrate the invention in more detail. In the examples and reference examples, the infrared IR analysis was always performed by the liquid film method, and the nuclear magnetic resonance NMR analysis was conducted in CDC13 with tetramethylsilane TMS as an internal standard. The field desorption mass spectrometry FD MASS analysis data values are values corrected on the 1H, 12C, 16O and 79Br basis. Example 1 Leaves 10 kg undried weight of Cryptomeria japonica as collected late June in Kurashiki City were air dried at about 500C for 24 hours and then immersed in 80 liters of chloroform at room temperature abouy 20 C for a week for extraction. The chloroform was distilled off from the extract, 5 liters of petroleum ether was added to the concentrate thus obtained, the insoluble matter was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated and subjected to silica gel chromatography using chloroform as the developing solvent. There was thus obtained about 25 g of an oil as a fraction crude polyprenyl fraction showing Rf values of 0.52 and 0.19 in thin layer chromatography Merck thin layer chromatographic plate coated with silica gel 60F254 to a layer thickness of 0.25 mm developing solvent nhexane ethyl acetate 9 l by volume developed 10 cm .In the above thin layer chromatography, solanesyl acetate gave an Rf value of 0.41. To this oil was added about 300 ml of acetone for dissolution of acetone soluble components, the mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated.The thus obtained oil was heated with 300 ml of methanol, 30 ml of water and 20 g of sodium hydroxide at 650C for 2 hours, then the methanol was distilled off, diethyl ether 400 ml was added to the residue for extraction, the ether layer was washed five times with about 100 ml of water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was then distilled off to give 19.8 g of an oil.This oil was chromatographed over about 1 kg of silica gel with a n hexane diisopropyl ether 90 10 by volume mixture as the eluent to give 17.2 g of an oily fraction showing an Rf value of 0.19 in the above thin layer chromatography.This oily fraction was a polyprenol fraction having a purity of not less than 90 .
