# An inverted optically enhanced solar cell.

## Abstract
An ultra high efficiency inverted solar cell structure is disclosed. At the rear of the cell is a high performance heterocontact made of SIPOS a mixture of micro crystalline silicon and silicon dioxide . At the edge of the cell, the op posite contact is of conventional heavily doped silicon. The edge contact is kept in the dark at least one diffusion length or one third mm laterally displaced away from both the ac tive illuminated region and from the active heterocontact.
