# Ribbon system and printing apparatus and method of operation thereof.

## Abstract
A ribbon system and printing apparatus include a typing ribbon in which the substrate material of the ribbon is stretched or deformed in operation upon impact by a hammer. Shaped means 201 205 are provided in the path of the ribbon for preferentially stretching or deforming a portion of the ribbon to a degree such that its elastic limit is exceeded, causing the ribbon to become crown shaped and thereby facilitating re spooling. The shaped means 201 205 may be mounted at any suitable location in the path of the ribbon, for example on the ribbon guidepost in a ribbon cartridge or in a boss formed in the cartridge.
