# INCREMENTAL ENCODER SYNCHRONOUS DECODE CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A synchronous decode circuit 10 for an incremental en coder is disclosed which comprises analog to digital con verters 16 for converting in phase and quadrature encoder signals to transistor to transistor logic TTL compatible signals, a latch 24 for receiving current logic level signals and the previous logic level signals for a gray code, a programmable 11 read only memory PROM 32 for decoding the logic level signals and generating clock and direction enable signals, and gating logic 38 connected to the PROM for gating clock and di rection signals to counters 52 of the system, the counters 52 are connected to a latch 56 under control of the computer to latch the count of movement in preselected directions for the a computer. In another embodiment the PROM includes scaling jumper means or error detection means or both for, respective ly, adjusting the range of measurement scale factor and in dicating error in the logic level signals.
