# Improvements in disc brakes for vehicles.

## Abstract
The application of a disc brake is initiated by operation of a pull rod 21 which is operative to move a pressure plate angularly, in turn to cause the plate to move axially and clamp a rotatable brake disc against a face in a housing. The outer end of the pull rod 21 is in screw threaded engage ment with a rotatable sleeve 10 which is axially slidable to a limited extent in a further housing 28 . The housing 28 is coupled to the hand lever 16 , and has an abutment with the sleeve 10 . A clutch ring 31 in screw threaded engage ment with the sleeve 10 is spring loaded so as to be urged into frictional engagement with the housing when the pull rod 21 is returned to a relatively retracted position following hydraulic application of the brake, with the clutch ring 31 being effective to cause rotation of the sleeve 10 to screw it further onto the pull rod 21 to compensate for wear of the friction linings.
