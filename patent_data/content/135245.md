## Abstract
Apparatus for treating the skin includes means to generate steam and a bellows 7 which may be reciprocated to generate an air current. The means to generate steam comprises a heater 11, 12 , a water reservoir comprising water absorbent material 16 disposed in an annular configuration within a removable attachment 3 and a water supplying fabric 20 which contacts the water absorbent material 16 through apertures 18 in an annular retainer 17 and which also contacts the heater. In use, the air current produced by the bellows 7 passes through the apparatus and entrains the generated steam and then flows out through an aperture 23 against a selected portion of the users skin.
