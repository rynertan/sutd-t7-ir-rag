# Anit skid brake control system with variable pressure increasing rate.

## Abstract
An anti skid brake control system comprise brake control system, according to the present invention, comprises a de tector for detecting the peak value of wheel acceleration in each cycle of skid control. Braking pressure is increased in step wise fashion by operating a pressure control valve be tween APPLICATION mode in which working fluid is supplied to a wheel cylinder to increase the braking pressure and HOLD mode in which the wheel cylinder is blocked from fluid commu nication to a hydraulic brake circuit to hold the braking pres sure constant, in alternative fashion. Duration for holding the pressure control valve is adjusted depending upon the de tected peak value of wheel acceleration. Whereby, average in creasing rate of braking pressure is variable depending upon the peak value of the wheel acceleration. Duration to hold the pressure control valve in APPLICATION mode is derived in proportion to the peak value of the wheel acceleration by tak ing demand derived by the peak value of wheel acceleration into account.
