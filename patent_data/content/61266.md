# Reducing doped polyacetylene crosslinking and embrittlement and compositions containing polyacetylene so treated.

## Abstract
A process for reducing doped polyacetylene crosslinking and embrittlement comprises treating the polyacetylene with one or more of the following agents a hindered phenols b alkyl ethers of hydroquinone, wherein the alkyl groups have 1 to 12 carbon atoms and c dialkyl thiodipropionates wherein each alkyl group has 1 to 18 carbon atoms and the alkyl groups in a single compound may be the same as or different from each other so as to distribute the agent s through the polyacetylene. The polyacetylene must be doped before treatment may be by simple immersion of the polyacetylene in pure protection agent, of a liquid, or a solution thereof. The treated polyacetylene has the protection agent s distributed therethrough.
