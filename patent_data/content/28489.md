# Enzyme derivatives, and their preparation.

## Abstract
An enzyme derivative comprises a binary complex bet ween streptokinase and plasminogen in which the catalytic site essential for fibrinolytic activity is blocked by a group which is removable by hydrolysis such that the pseudo first order rate constant for hydrolysis of the derivative is in the range 10 ⁶sec ¹ to 10 ³sec ¹ in isotonic aqueous media at pH 7.4 at 37 C, and is useful in the treatment of venous throm bosis.
