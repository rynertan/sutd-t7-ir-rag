# Thermal printing head.

## Abstract
Cracking in a Ta₂O₅ anti abrasion layer 11 of a thermal printing head results from the crystallization of Ta₂O₅ in the layer. The crystallization can be suppressed by the addition of SiO₂ to the layer. Thus, the anti abrasion layer is kept from cracking even under high speed printing conditions using a pulse width of 1 ms or less, and also under high colour density printing conditions requiring an input power density auch as 50 mj mm². Also, the thermal wearing life of the printing head can be extended to more than 10 times that of a conventional thermal printing head employing a pure Ta₂O₅ anti abrasion layer. The thermal printing head is subjected to an appropriate annealing process to stabilize the resistivity of its heat elements 4, R, R . The anti abrasion layer is provided in the form of a uniform mixture of Ta₂O₅ throughout the layer by sputtering a target composed of a mixture of tantalum and silicon ingredients.
