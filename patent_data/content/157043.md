# The production of mannitol and higher mannosaccharide alcohols.

## Abstract
A method for hydrolyzing coffee extraction residue ma terials to produce manno saccharides having a degree of polymerization from 1 to 10 and subsequently neutralizing and reducing said mixture of manno saccharides to their corresponding alcohols. The coffee material, preferably spent coffee gounds from a commercial percolation system, is hydrolyzed in a Plug Flow tubular reactor in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid. Depending on the time, temperature, pressure and catalyst concentration selected, manno saccharide or mannose is produced. The a manno saccharides or mannose produced are separated from coffee residue material in the form of a syrup and neutralized with calcium hydroxide. The neutralized mixture of manno saccharides or mannose is reduced to their corre sponding alcohols or mannitol.
