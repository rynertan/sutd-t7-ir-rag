# Battery charging circuit.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fast charge circuit suitable for use with battery cells which can be charged at a 4C rate. Line voltage is transformed, full wave rectified and applied to the battery pack. A pair of voltage comparators monitor a sensing voltage which is indicative of the charging voltage and the trough voltage of the battery cells. During a win dow when the sensing voltage is less than a predetermined threshold and trough voltage exceeds this threshold, the comparators indicate that charging should be terminated. Alternatively, if excessive temperature on the cells is detected or a selected amount of time passes without reach ing full charge, fast charging is also terminated. After the fast charging interval trickle charging of the cells is employed to bring the battery pack to full charge and maintain it there.
