# Red monoazo sulfonic acid dyestuffs for polyamide.

## Abstract
Red monoazo dyestuffs from diazotized 2 cyanoaniline or 2 cyano 3 , 4 or 5 halo aniline and 2 amino 8 hydroxy naphthalene 6 sulfonic acid. These dyes are particularly distinguished by their good migration and leveling propert ies and excellent fastness to light. Said dyestuffs are more over suitable for obtaining very even combination dyeings together with known blue, yellow and orange acid dyestuffs. These dyestuffs are particularly suited for the dyeing of carpeting, upholstery fabrics and drapery materials.
