# HEAT RECOVERY SYSTEM FOR A FURNACE

## Abstract
A heat extractor system for a furnace, said furnace including a burner with a chimney that is connected but is normally not in operation. Instead, the furnace is connected to a vent in parallel with the chimney through a draft inducing arrangement including a water spray in which water is heated and circulated to a point where the heat from the water is utilized. Due to the parallel arrangement of the vent and chimney, if the vent fails to operate, it will function in a fail safe manner, with the combusted gases from the burner leaving through the chimney.
