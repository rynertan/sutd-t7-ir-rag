# Apparatus for covering a disc wheel for motor vehicle.

## Abstract
An apparatus for covering a disc wheel supporting a tyre for a motor vehicle, has a wheel cover 4 mounted on the disc wheel and covering an outer side of the disc wheel, and at least one ventilation opening 66 in the wheel cover for connecting the inside of the wheel cover with the atmo sphere. A closing plate 67 closes the ventilation openings 66 when the temperature inside the wheel cover 4 is not more than a predetermined temperature, and opens the ventilation openings 66 when the temperature inside the wheel cover 4 is more than the predetermined tempera ture. A heat sensing member 68 which may be made of a shape memory effect alloy, is connected to the closing plate 67 and deforms when the temperature inside the wheel cover is more than the predetermined temperature so as to displace the closing plate 67 away from the openigs 66 to open the openings.
