# Separate quench and evaporative cooling of compressor discharge stream.

## Abstract
Compressed gases are cooled by direct sequential contact with a non evaporative cooling liquid which acts as a quench to remove sensible heat from the compressed gas and b evaporative cooling liquid which cools the gas by evaporation.
