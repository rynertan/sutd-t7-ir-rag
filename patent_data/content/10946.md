# A water faucet.

## Abstract
A water saving faucet, particularly for kitchen sinks and bathroom basins, is provided. The faucet comprises at least one water valve 60, 62 , a sink sweeping movable spout 20 and a spout valve means 12 coupled to a spout. The open and closed states of the faucet are controllable by the movable spout and the open state of the faucet is substantially unaffected by the sweep of the movable spout across the effective area of the sink or basin. An attachment for converting a standard mixing faucet having a movable spout into a water saving mixing faucet is also provided.
