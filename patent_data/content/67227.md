# DATA REWRITING METHOD FOR BUBBLE MEMORY.

## Abstract
A data rewriting system which writes specific data in the final record Bn of the first data memory location 102a of a bubble memory representing that the data in the first data memory location 102a of the bubble memory 102 is invalid so as to maintain concurrence of the data during rewriting of the data in the bubble memory even if electric power is interrupted, and rewriting the new data sequentially in the head record B₁ to the final record Bn of the first data memory location 102a under the control of the bubble controller. This data rewriting system also erases the specific data after completing rewriting in the first data memory location 102a and then writes the new data written in the first memory location 102a again in the head record A₁ to the final record An of the second data record location 102a .
