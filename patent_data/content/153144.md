# Magnetic refrigerating apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic refrigerating apparatus comprises two pair of superconductive coils 14a, 14b, 15a, 15b for generating magnetic fields, a tank 6 for receiving helium 64 to be cooled, and a pair of heat absorbers 22a, 22b each includ ing a working substance adapted to generate heat when lo cated inside the magnetic field generated by the coils and to ab sorb heat when located outside the magnetic field. The heat ab sorbers are alternately transferred between a first position where either of the heat absorbers is located inside the magnet ic field and a second position where the heat absorber is located outside the magnetic field so that one of the heat absorbers is in the first position when the other is in the second position, whereby helium is cooled by either of the heat absorbers when the heat absorber is in the second position. The heat absorbers each include working substance pieces W1, W2, W3, W4 ar ranged at regular intervals along the direction of transfer there of, and adiabatic spacers I1, I2, I3 each interposed between adjacent pieces to prevent direct contact between the pieces.
