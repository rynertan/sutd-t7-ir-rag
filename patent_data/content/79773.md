# Method of forming strengthened assemblies of titanium containing iron based alloys.

## Abstract
A method of forming strengthened assemblies having iron based components to which titanium has been internal ly added prior to casting which includes internally nitriding and brazing. The components are formed, coated with powdered brazing alloy and stacked in jigs in their assem bled form. The assembly is dispersion strengthened by nitridation to form an array of titanium nitride particles by heating in an atomic nitrogen yielding atmosphere. Excess nitrogen is then removed by denitriding in a dry hydrogen atmosphere at a higher temperature and the assembly is then brazed at a still higher temperature.
