# IMPROVED PIEZOELECTRIC CERAMIC SWITCHING DEVICES AND SYSTEMS AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME

## Abstract
Improved piezoelectric ceramic switching devices are described along with their method of fabrication. In addition to the devices themselves, novel electric circuits are de scribed for the energization as well as the use of such devices as switching elements in electrical systems. Parts of both the energization circuits and or utilization circuits employing the piezo ceramic switching device are physically mounted on and supported by non polarized parts of the piezoelectric ceramic plate elements comprising the switching devices so that lightweight compact construction is achieved along with substantial reduction of stray inductance intercoupling.
