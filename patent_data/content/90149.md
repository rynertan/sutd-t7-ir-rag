# Leader block in a single reel magnetic tape catridge.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape cartridge 10 is shown in which a length of magnetic tape is wound on a reel hub with the free end of the tape permanently connected to a generally rectangular shaped leader block 16 by a pin 22. The car tridge completely surrounds the reel of magnetic tape ex cept for an opening 18 provided at one corner 100 the cartridge. This opening permits tape 12 wound on the reel to be unwound as the leader block is moved away from the cartridge, preferably by an automatic threading mechanism. The leader block 16 has a coupling slot 24 for engagement by the pick up arm 46 of the threading mechanism. The slot 24 has an enlarged socket 54 at its lower end to receive the head 56 of the arm 46 . The leader block has a cut away portion 52 reducing its thickness to provide a cavity into which the head 56 can be positioned before relative axial movement carries it into the socket 54 .
