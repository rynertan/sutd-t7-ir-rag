# Crosslinkable autodeposition coating compositions.

## Abstract
Autodeposition coating compositions containing cer tain relatively water insoluble derivatives of glycoluril will crosslink upon curing. The resulting coating exhibits improved block resistance and solvent resistance over heretofore available autodeposition coatings.
