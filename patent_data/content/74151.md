# Arrangement for receiving tv signals having left and right stereo sound signals.

## Abstract
Arrangement for receiving TV signals containing left and right stereo sound signals, a first sound carrier being frequency modulated by the sum signal L R of the two stereo sound signals and the second carrier being frequency modulated by twice the right stereo sound signal 2R , comprising a first FM demodulator for demodulating the sum signal from the first sound carrier and a second FM demodulator, for demodulating twice the right stereo sound signal from the second sound carrier, a matrix circuit for deriving at least the left stereo sound signal from the sum signal and twice the right stereo sound signal and a left and right sound channel for the respective left and right stereo sound signals, the possibility of a simple mono stereo signal control being obtained such as it is already known for prior art stereo radio receivers in addition to an advantageous noise distribution over the left and the right stereo sound channels. For this purpose the said matrix circuit consists of a first sub matrix for deriving a difference signal L R and or R L of the two stereo sound signals from the sum signal and twice the right stereo sound signal, and a second sub matrix for deriving at least the left stereo sound signal from the sum signal and the difference signal.
