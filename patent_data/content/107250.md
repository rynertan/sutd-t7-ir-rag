# Operational amplifier.

## Abstract
An operational amplifier with frequency compensation is described. The amplifier comprises a first amplifier 2 with a low impedance output 10 followed by a transconductance amplifier 3 with a capacitive feed forward C‚ÇÅ . The transcon ductance amplifier 3 is followed by a Miller integrator 8, 9 .
