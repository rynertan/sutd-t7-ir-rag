# Method of forming a metallic silicide.

## Abstract
A method of forming a metallic silicide 22 on silicon 10 or polysilicon 14 in which a masking layer such as silicon dioxide 12 is formed on a silicon slice and patterned to expose selected areas of the slice surface. The slice is then sputter etched followed by in situ deposition of a metal layer. The slice is heated to convert the portion of the metal layer in contact with the silicon 10 and or polysilicon 14 to a metal silicide 22 , then the non converted metal is removed by a selective etchant. The siliciding may be per formed in an ambient including nitrogen to prevent out diffusion of silicon.
