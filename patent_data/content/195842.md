## Abstract
A device having a slidable body driven by a syn chronous type electric motor, wherein a cylindrical drum is secured to the output shaft of the motor, a leaf spring is provided between the drum periphery and the slidabie body, and the position control of the slidable body is per formed by counting the frequency of the power circuit is disclosed. The output shaft of the motor has a specific rotating speed or angle relative to the frequency of the power source. Therefore, the sliding body has a specific amount of axial reciprocating movement depending on the direction of the rotation of the output shaft of the motor. It is, therefore, possible to determine the actual position of the sliding body by counting the frequency of the power source simultaneousiy with the rotation of the output shaft of the motor. Because the drum which connects the slidable body by means of the leaf spring is precision cylindrical, the leaf spring on the surface of the drum converts the rotation of the output shaft of the motor accurately to the axial movement of the sliding body.
