# COMPOSITE CIRCUIT BREAKER

## Abstract
A composite circuit breaker comprises a closing switch part 12 disposed between a pair of conductors 10, 11 at a position relatively near a load apparatus, a vacuum circuit breaking part 2 disposed between the conductors at a posi tion adjacent to the closing switch part but relatively remote from the load apparatus, an operating mechanism 22 operat ing the making and breaking operation of the closing switch part and vacuum circuit breaking part, and a delaying mecha nism including a delaying lever 31 for delaying the making and breaking operation of the vacuum circuit breaking part actuat ed by the operating mechanism relative to that of the closing switch part operated by the operating mechanism.
