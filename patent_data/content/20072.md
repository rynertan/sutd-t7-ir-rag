# Analytical method and apparatus for the determination of the total nitrogen content in a sample.

## Abstract
An analytical method for the determination of the total nitrogen content in a sample, which comprises passing an inert gas stream containing substantially no nitrogen in order, through a first reaction tube 10 into which a sample to be analyzed is introduced and which is packed with a decomposition catalyst 11 and an oxidizing agent 12 and maintained at a temperature in the range of from 700 to 1100 C, a condenser 15 for condensing unnecessary components in the gaseous products from the first reaction tube 10 , a second reaction tube 17 which is packed with an oxidizing agent 18 and a reducing agent 19 and maintained at a temperature in the range of from 400 to 800 C, a moisture absorbing tube 23 and a carbon dioxide gas absorbing tube 26 and passing the nitrogen gas coming out of the carbon dioxide gas absorbing tube 26 to a nitrogen gas analyzer 30 to determine the nitrogen gas content, and an apparatus for carrying out such a method.
