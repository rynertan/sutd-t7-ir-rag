## Description
STROMA FREE H EMOGLOBIN SOLUTION, PROCESS FOR THEPREPARATION THEREOF AND APPLICATION THEREOF.THIS INVENTiON, MADE BY DRS. R. SPROKHOLT AND DR. .H.J. MAAS, RELATES TO A STABLE STROMA FREE HEMOGLOBINSOLUTION, A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF ANG APPLICATION OF SAID SOLUTION AS STANDARD FOR CALIBRATIONAND QUALITY CONTROL OF BLOOD GAS CONTROL APPARATUS ANDMEASURING HEMOGLOBIN DERIVATIVES HB DERIVATIVES .STROMA FREE HEMOGLOK N SOLUTIONS AND A PROCESS FOR THEPREPARATION THEREOF ARE KNOWN, I.A. FROM U.S. PATENTSPECIFICATION 4,401,652. SUCH SOLUTIONS ARE SUITABLE ASBLOOD SUBSTITUTES DURING ACUTE BLOOG SHORTAGE. BUT AREESPECIALLY USED AS STANDARD FOR CALIBRATION AND THEQUALITY CONTROL OF DETERMINATIONS OF PH, PRO2, P 02 ANDHB DERIVATIVES IN BLOOD.DETERMINATIONS OF PH1 PLOT AND P02 AND HEMOGLOBINDERIVATIVES IN BLOOD ARE PRESENTLY DONE QUITE FREQUENTLYIN CLINICAL AND OTHER LABORATORIES. THE THREE FIRSTMENTIONED DETERMINATIONS GENERALLY ARE DONE BY MEANS OFSPECIFIC ELECTRODES AND ARE ALWAYS RELATIVE, THAT ISTO SAY THAT THE UNKNOWN SAMPLE IS COMPARED WITH A KNOWNSOLUTION. SIMILARLY THE CONTENTS OF HEMOGLOBIN HB AND HB DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLLY. THE QUALITY OF THE COMPARATIVE COMPOSITIONTHIS IS OF PREDOMINATING IMPORTANCE.SAID CALIBRATION WITH STANDARD SOLUTIONS AND THE QUALITYCONTROL THEREOF SHOULD BE DONE EVERY DAY AND IN THEUNITED STATED OF NORTH AMERICA IT WAS ALREADY SUGGESTEDTO MAKE THIS LEGALLY REQUIRED AND PREFERABLY THREESOLUTIONS ARE CALIBRATED, ON HAVING THE RELEVANT PARAMETERS AT OR ABOUT THE NORMAL VALUE FOR HEALTHYPERSONS, ONE WITH SAID PARAMETERS NEAR THE LOWEST VALUEOCCURING IN PRACTICE, AND ONE WITH SAID PARAMETERS NEARTHE HIGHEST VALUE OCCURRING IN PRACTICE. AN INCREASED ORREDUCED ACIDITY IS ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED OR REDUCEDPCO2 AND P02 RESPECTIVELY. DESIRABLE ARE CONTROLCOMPOSITIONS HAVING PH OF RESPECTIVELY 7,2, 7,4 AND 7,6HAVING A P02 OF RESPECTIVELY ABOUT 130. 100 AND 70 MMHG, AND A PLOT 2 OF RESPECTIVELY ABOUT 60, 40 AND 20 MMHG. ALTHOUGH IT IS IN PRINCIPLE GENERALLY KNOWN TO CHECK ACONTROL APPARATUS BY INTRODUCING A KNOWN COMPOSITIONTHEREIN, THIS CAUSES GREAT PROBLEMS WITH BLOOD. BLOODIS LIABLE TO METABOLISM SO THAT THEPH, PCO2,PO2 AND THEFRACTIONS OF THE HB DERIVATIVES CHANGE. MOREOVER GASEXCHANGE WITH THE SURROUNDINGS MAY APPEAR EASILY, AS THEPARTIAL PRESSURES OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN DEVIATESTRONGLY FROM THOSE IN THE BLOOD. THUS EVERY DAY A NEWSTANDARD COMPOSITION SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM A CLOSEDVESSEL. AFTER EQUILIBRATING OR TONOMETERING THEREOFWITH A SELECTED GAS MIXTURE MOSTLY THESE ARE THREEDIFFERENT MIXTURES THE DESIRED VALUES ARE OBTAINED. FORTHOSE ACQUAINTED WITH TONOMETERY THIS WILL BE CLEAR. ANDTHE KEEPABILITY OF SAID STANDARD COMPOSITION SHOULD MEET VERY HIGH REQUIREMENTS.THE PH SHOULD BE WITHIN 0.01 OF THE INDICATED VALUE, AND THE PC02 AND P02 2 WITHIN 1MMHG OF THE VALUES GIVEN THEREFOR. AND THIS SHOULD APPLY DURINGTHE GUARANTEED SHELF LIFE UNTIL THE OF THE EXPIRATION DATE BLOOD, WHICH IS NEITHER CONSERVABLE NOR HOMOGENEOUS, ISUNSUITABLE AS CALIBRATING AND REFERENCE LIQUID. HEMOGLOBINSOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED BY HEMOLYSIS OF RED BLOODCORPUSCLES ERYTHROCYTES AND CENTRIFUGING OF THE DEBRISAND OTHER UNDISSOLVED MATERIAL THE STROMA DO BETTER.,PREPARATION METHODS OF STROMA FREE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTIONSARE DESCRIBED IN THE EAST GERMAN PATENT SPECIFICATION 150,543 AND THE ABOVE MENTIONED U.S. PATENT SPECIFICATION 4,401,652. LTHOUGH SUCH COMPOSITIONS ARE HOMOGENEOUS ANDCONSEQUENTLY ALREADY MUCH BETTER THEY ARE NOT STABLE EITHER.EVEN IF BACTERIAL INFECTION IS PREVENTED BY ASEPSIS THEACTIVE HOMOGLOBIN CONTENT DECREASES RATHER QUICKLY,MAINLY IN THAT HEMOGLOBIN CONVERTS INTO INACTIVE METHEMOGLOBIN AN OXIDATION OF FE II INTO FE III . THEAFFINITY OF METHOMOGLOBIN FOR OXYGEN IS SUBSTANTIALLYZERO.THEREFORE FOR CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL OF BLOODGAS CONTROL APPARATUS AND METERS OF HB DERIVATIVESGENERALLY USE MADE OF AQUEOUS BUFFER SOLUTIONS ORFLUOROHYDROCARBON SOLUTIONS ALSO CONTAINING A BUFFER ANDMOREOVER SUCH AN AMOUNT OF BICARBONATE THAT WITH THEPREVAILING PH ALSO THE CORRECT PCO2 PREVAILS THEY CANABSORB REVERSIBLY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN. FORTHE DETERMINATION OF THE HB CONTENTS A GOOD CALIBRATION LIQUID BASED ON HICN IS AVAILABLE, BUT FOR THE QUALITYCONTROL OF THE DETERMINATION METHOD IT FAILS.EMULSIONS OF FLUOROHYDROCARBONS FOR SUBSTITUTING BLOODIN THE CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF THE QUALITY OF BLOODCONTROL APPARATUS ARE l.A. DESCRIBED IN U.S. PATENT SPECIFICATION54.299,728 AND 4,369,127. SUITABLE FLUOROHYDROCARBONS ARE PERFLUOROMETHYLCYCLOHEXANE. PERFLUORODIMETHYLDECALIN AND MIXTURES THEREOF AND THEPERFLUOROTRIBUTYLAMINE. I.A. THE COURSE OF THE P02WITH THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN ABSORBED IS QUITE DIFFERENTFROM WITH HEMOGLOBIN.AS IS KNOWN WITH A HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION THE PLOT OF THE 02 TENSION AGAINST THE AMOUNT OF ABSORBED OXYGEN SHOWSAN S FORM, BUT IT IS LINEAR WITH OTHER OXYGEN BUFFERSSUCH AS THE FLUOROHYDROCARBONS. WITH HEMOGLOBIN THEINCLINATION IS MUCH STEEPER THAN WITH OTHER KNOWNSUBSTANCES, WHICH IS DUE TO CONFORMATION CHANGES WHENOXYGEN IS ABSORBED.THERE WAS NO LACK OF EFFORTS TO MAKE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTIONSSTABLE. NATURALLY HEMOGLOBIN SEENS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 2,3 DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE DPG WHICH HAS SOME STABILIZINGINFLUENCE ON HEMOGLOBIN. BUT SAID COMBINATION DISSOCIATESVERY EASILY AND ITS STABILITY IS INSUFFICIENT FOR PRACTICE.IN GERMAN AUSLEGESCHRIFT 2,617,822 IT IS PROPOSED TO USEFOR THIS AIM 1,1 G OF PYRIDOXALPHOSPHATE PER LITER OF 6 8 HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION, WHICH HOWEVER APPEARS TOBIND WITH THE HEMOGLOBIN AS A RESULT OF THE ALDEHYDEGROUP TO RESULT IN A COMBINATION A PART OF WHICH HAS ACERTAIN AFFINITY FOR OXYGEN AND THE OTHER PART A DIFFERENT,LOWER AFFINITY. THUS THERE ARE IN SUCH A COMPOSITION VIRTUALLY TWO KINDS OF HEMOGLOBIN, AND THE PROCEEDINGOF THE PLOT OF THE ABSORBED OXYGEN AGAINST THE P02 ISTHEREFORE IS CONSIDERABLY SMOOTHER, WHICH IS UNFAVOURABLEFOR A CALIBRATION LIQUID AND A COMPOSITION FOR QUALITYCONTROL.ANOTHER HEMOGLOBIN COMPOSITION CONSITS ON THE ONE HANDOF LYOPHILISED HEMOGLOBIN AND ON THE OTHER HAND A BUFFERSOLUTION HAVING ALL REMAINING NECESSARY COMPONENTS, WHICHARE TO BE MIXED JUST BEFORE USING THEM. SUCH A COMPOSITIONHAS THE USUAL DISADVANTAGE THAT THE DISSOLUTION SHOULDPROCEED VERY COMPLETELY, OTHERWISE DOUBT REMAINS.MOREOVER DRY HEMOGLOBIN DIFFERENT FROM HEMOGLOBIN INSOLUTION IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE FOR OXIDATION INTOMETHEMOGLOBIN, AS IS DESCRIBED BY DEVENUTO ET AL. INSURG. GYNEC. OBST. 48 1979 69 75 AND BY LABRUDE ET ALIN J. PHARM. PHARMACOL. 33 1981 115 117. NOW IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ABOVE OBJECTIONS ARE OVERCOMEAND A STABLE COMPOSITION WILL BE HAD, WHICH IS WELLSUITABLE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, IF HEMOGLOBIN HB IS PROTECTED WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF INOSITOLHEXAPHOSPHATE IPH . THEREFORE A STROMA FREE HEMOGLOBINSOLUTION ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION CONTAINS INOSITOLHEXAPHOSPHATE IN SUCH AN AMOUNT THAT THE MOLAR RATIOIHP HB IS FROM 0,1 1 TO 1,0 1.IT APPEARED THAT IN SUCH A SOLUTION IMMEDIATELY AFTERMIXING LESS THAN 2 OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HEMOGLOBINIS METHEMOGLOBIN AND, AFTER KEEPING IT AT 40C OR LOWERDURING ONE YEAR, LESS THAN 7 . THE P50 I.E. THE OXYGENTENSION WITH 50 , LOAD OF THE TOTAL HEMOGLOBIN WITHOXYGEN DECREASES SOMEWHAT IN THAT METHEMOGLOBIN HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW P50. IF 5 OF THE HEMOGLOBIN CONVERTSINTO METHEMOGLOBIN THE P50 DECREASES WITH 0.5 MMHG 67 PA . IN ANY CASE THE P50 OF THE COMPOSITION WHENKEEPING IT IN THE REFRIGERATION WILL DECREASE IN SIXMONTHS NO MORE THAN 2 MMHG 267 PA . A COMBINATION OF HEMOGLOBIN WITH INOSITOL HEXOPHOSPHATEWAS, AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE OF, ONLY MENTIONED BEFORE INAN ARTICLE BY P.M. BREEPOEL ET AL IN PFLUGERS ARCHIV 389 1981 227 235, WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN THAT IHP AS WELL ASDGP AND ATP ADENOSINTRIPHOSPHATE REDUCES THE OXYGENAFFINITY OF BOVINE HEMOGLOBIN. HOWEVER THE DIFFERENCESWERE SMALL, AND THE KEEPABILITY OF SIMILAR COMBINATIONSHAD NOT BEEN EXAMINED. THE MOLAR RATION IHP HB OF THESOLUTION DESCRIBED IN SAID ARTICLE WAS 2 1. FURTHERMORE IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CONVERSION OFHEMOGLOBIN INTO METHEMOGLOBIN, ALREADY LOW, CAN BERETARDED FURTHER BY USING THE ENZYME METHEMOGLOBIN REDUCTASE, WHICH OCCURS NATURALLY IN ERYTHROCYTES ANDCONSEQUENTLY IN THE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION ACCORDING TOTHE INVENTION. SAID ENZYME REVERTS THE IRREVERSIBLECONVERSION OF HEMOGLOBIN METHEMOGLOBIN. REQUIREDTHEREFORE IS THE PRESENCE OF NADH REDUCED FORM OFNICOTINE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE OF WHICH SO MUCH HASTO BE PRESENT THAT THE MOLAR RATIO NADH HB IS FROM 0.25 1 TO 1,50 1, OPTIMAL IS A MOLAR RATIO NADH HB OFABOUT 0.5 1. INSTEAD OF NADH ALSO NADPH THE REDUCEDFORM OF NICOTINE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATE MAYBE PRESENT.THE HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION OF THE COMPOSITION WILL BEGENERALLY IN THE RANGE FROM 3 MMOL L TO 15 MMOL L PREFERABLY IT IS ABOUT 8 MMOL L.THE CONTENTS OF SODIUM. POTASSIUM, CHLORIDE AND OPTIONALLYOTHER IONS WILL BE WITHIN THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RANGES. THEBICARBONATE CONTENT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE DESIREDPH AND THE DESIRED PC02. IN OXYGEN BUFFERNG CAPACITY SAID COMPOSITION IS EQUALTO BLOOD, AND THE P50 REACTS TO A SHIFT OF THE PH INABOUT THE SAME WAY AS OF BLOOD, IF ANY.THE P50 IS ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE IHP CONTENT. HEREWITHTHE PSO CAN BE ADJUSTED AT NORMAL AT THOSE ACID BASECONDITIONS THAT ARE CHARACTERIZING FOR ACIDOSIS, NORMALCONDITION AND ALKALOSIS. IT IS ALSO PREFERABLE, AS ISINDICATED ABOVE, TO PROVIDE THE CALIBRATION AND REFERENCELIQUIDS ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION IN SERIES OF THREE,ONE WITH PH, PLOT AND P02 2 AT OR ABOUT THE NORMAL VALUESFOR HEALTHY PERSONS, ONE WITH SAID PARAMETERS NEARTHE LOWEST VALUE OCCURRING IN PRACTICE, AND ONE WITHSAID PARAMETERS NEAR THE HIGHEST VALUE OCCURRING INPRACTICE.THE INVENTION ALSO RELATES TO A PROCESS FOR PREPARINGA STROMA FREE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION. THEREFOR BEFOREHEMOLYSIS THE ERYTROCYTES ARE PURIFIED BY REPEATEDRINSING WITH AN ISOTONIC OR WEAKLY HYPERTONIC NACL SOLUTION AND PREFERABLY THEY ARE ALSO PREVIOUSLY STRIPPED OFLEUCOCYTES BY FEEDING A SUSPENSION THEREOF THROUGH ACOLUMN WITH A SUITABLE ABSORBENT E.G. ERYPUR OF THEORGANON COMPANY . THIS WAS KNOWN I.A. FROM THE ABOVEMENTIONED U.S. PATENT SPECIFICATION. THE LYSIS IS REALISED BY BRINGING THE PURIFIED ERYTROCYTESINTO A MINIMUM OF TWO VOLUMES BUT PREFERABLY IN FOURVOLUMES OF A STRONGLY HYPOTONIC SOLUTION, PREFERABLYSTERILE DISTILLED OR DEMINERALIZED WATER, WHICH, ASPRECAUTION1 GENERALLY ALSO CONTAINS SOME BACTERICIDE. IFDESIRED THE LYSIS CAN BE SPEEDED UP WITH ULTRASONICVIBRATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT ESSENTIAL. PREFERABLY THELYSATE IS CENTRIFUGED, SO THAT THE STROMA DEBRIS OF THEERYTHROCYTE CELL WALLS AND OTHER SOLIDS IS REMOVED.THE SUPERNATANT IS EVACUATED CAREFULLY FROM THE SEDIMENTBY MEANS OF A SIPHON. IF DESIRED SAID LYSATE ISCONCENTRATED, WHICH E.G. CAN BE DONE BY EVAPORATIONBUT PREFERABLY BY ULTRAFILTRATION, E.G. BY MEANS OFSHAFTS OF HOLLOW FIBRES.TO SAID SOLUTION THE IONS NA , K , CA 2 , Mug 2 1 HCO AND 3 CL ARE ADDED AS SALTS, IN SUCH AMOUNTS THAT THE FINALSOLUTION WILL HAVE THE DESIRED CONCENTRATIONS OF SODIUM,POTASSIUM, MAGNESIUM AND CHLORIDE. BY PREVIOUS CAREFULCALCULATION THE AMOUNT OF BICARBONATE THE PH WILL THENBE AT THE DESIRED VALUE. OFTEN IT WILL BE NECESSARYTO CENTRIFUGE THE SOLUTION ONCE AGAIN TO OBTAIN A REALLYCLEAR FINAL COMPOSITION. FINALLY BY GASSING WITH AMIXTURE OF NITROGEN, CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN THE PCO2 AND P02 ARE ADJUSTED AT THE CORRECT VALUES.THE PROCESS OF THE INVENTION IS NOW CHARACTERIZED INTHAT AFTER THE LYSIS SO MUCH INOSITOL HEXAPHOSPHATE ISADDED THAT THE MOLAR RATIO IHP HB IS FROM 0,1 1 TO 1,0 1. THE YIELD OF HEMOGLOBIN MAY BE AS MUCH AS 90 95 . IT APPEARED THAT WITH SAJD PREPARATION OPTIMALLY TOGETHER WITH THE IHP ALSO NADH IS BE ADDED, THE BESTAT SUCH A CONCENTRATION THAT THE MOLAR RATIO NADH HBBECOMES ABOUT 0.5 1.MOREOVER IT APPEARED THAT THE STABILITY, ALREADY HIGH,OF THE COMPOSITION MAY BE INCREASED FURTHER, SUCH THATEVEN AFTER 1 YEAR AT 40C OR LOWER ABSOLUTELY NOPRECIPITATION IS FOUND IN IT. IF THE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTIONIS SUBJECTED TO A DOUBLE PH SHIFT AND THE PRECEPITATESTHEN APPEARING IN IT ARE SEPARATED BEFORE THE SOLUTIONIS BROUGHT AT THE DESIRED FINAL CONTENTS OF HB, IHP, NADH AND OTHER COMPONENTS AND THE DESIRED 2 AND CO2 TENSIONS ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION SO MUCH IHP ISADDED TO THE LYSATE THAT THE MOLAR RATIO OF IHP rIB ISABOUT 0.5 1. WITH DILUTED NAOH THE PH IS ADJUSTEDBETWEEN 8,0 AND 8,1. THE PRECIPITATE IS REMOVED BYCENTRIFUGING. THE PH IS NOW ADJUSTED WITH DILUTED HCL ATBETWEEN 6,9 AND 7,0. THE PRECIPITATE IS REMOVED BYCENTRIFUGING AND FINALLY AFTER ADDING SODIUM, POTASSIUM, CALCIUM3 MAGNESIUM, BICARBONATE AND CHLORIDE TO ATTAINTHE DESIRED VALUES THE PH1 PCO2 AND PO ARE ADJUSTED.FINALLY THE INVENTION ALSO RELATES TO THE APPLICATION OFSAID STABLE COMPOSITION. IN THE FIRST PLACE IT MAY BEUSED WHEN DETERMINING THE PH, PC02, PO2 ANDOR HEMOGLOBINCONTENT IN BLOODy THIS DETERMINATION NOW BEING CALIBRATEDWITH A SOLUTION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS IS ALREADY SAIDTHIS HAS THE ADVANTAGES THAT ALSO AFTER KEEPING IT FOR ALONG TIME AN ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE COMPOSITION IS OBTAINEDWHICH CAN BE USED WITHOUT ANY PRECAUTION AND WHICH ISALSO FREE OF HAZE.BUT SUCH A HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION MAY ALSO BE USED AS BLOOD SUBSTITUTE HAVING THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT DOES NOT SHOWIMMUNOGENITY BY THE ABSENCE OG THE ERYTHROCYTE CELLWALLS . ON THE OTHER HAND IT WILL BE EXCRETED VERYQUICKLY IN THAT THE KIDNEYS DO NOT RETAIN AT ALLHEMOGLOBIN NOT LOCKED WITHIN THE RED BLOOD CORPUSCLES.THUS IT IS SPECIALLY CONSIDERED FOR INFUSION IN EMERGENCYCASES.FURTHER IT MAY ALSO BE USED AS STANDARD FOR THE SPECTROPHOTOMETRICAL DETERMINATION OF HEMOGLOBIN AND HBDERIVATIVES.THE INVENTION IS NOW ELUCIDATED BY THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES.EXAMPLE 1ALL ACTIONS WERE DONE UNDER STERILE CONDITIONS LAMINAIRAIRFLOW CABINET, CLASS 100 STERILE SOLUTIONS, ETC. .1 HUMAN BLOOD WAS COLLECTED IN ACD SOLUTION, PORTIONS OF 420 ML IN BOTTLES OF 500 ML IN WHICH ALREADY 80ML OF ACD SOLUTION WAS PRESENT. TOTALLY 6 LITERS.2 SAID BOTTLES WERE PLACED IN CENTRIFUGE CUPS AND CENTRIFUGED AT 3000 X G DURING 30 MINUTES. THE SUPERNATANTS WEREEVACUATED THROUGH SIPHONS. PER BOTTLE 200 250 ML OFCELLS WERE RECOVERED.3 THE BLOOD CELLS WERE SUSPENDED IN Or9 NACL SOLUTION,FINAL VOLUME 500 ML PER BOTTLE.4 THE BLOOD CELL SUSPENSIONS WERE FED THROUGH A COLUMN LEUCOFILTER ERYPUR OF THE ORGANOM COMPANY SO THATTHE WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND A GREATER PART OF THE BLOOD PLATELETS WERE REMOVED.5 THE BLOOD CELL SUSPENSIONS WERE CENTRIFUGED AT 3000 X G DURING 30 MINUTES. THE SUPERNATANTS WERE REMOVEDWITH A SIPHON.6 SIMILARLY TO 3 MAKING UP TO 500 ML PER BOTTLE WASDONE WITH 0.9 NACL SOLUTION.7 SIMILARLY TO 5 CENTRIFUGING WAS DONE AGAIN AT 3000 GDURING 30 MINUTES1 THE SUPERNATANTS WERE DISCARDED.8 PER BOTTLE THERE WERE NOW ABOUT 200 ML OF ERYTHROCYTES.9 ALL PORTIONS OF ERYTHROCYTES WERE COMBINED AND MIXEDWELL, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DISTRIBUTED OVER BOTTLES OF 3LITERS, EACH BOTTLE CONTAINING 0.6 LITER OF ERYTHROCYTES.NOW TO EACH BOTTLE 2.4 LITERS OF STERILE1 DISTILLED WATERWAS ADDED AND MIXED. ALSO PER LITER 1 G OF NEOMYCINSULPHATE DISSOLVED IN ABOUT 2 ML WATER WAS ADDED TOPREVENT BACTERIAL GROWTH . SAID MIXTURES WERE KEPTIN A REFRIGERATOR AT 40C DURING ONE NIGHT.10 THE COOLED HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION WAS DISTRIBUTED ATROOM TEMPERATURE OVER POLYCARBONATE CENTRIFUGE BOTTLES STERILE1 WITH A SPECIAL CLOSURE . HEREIN THEY WERECENTRIFUGED AT 0 100C AT 27,000 G IN A SORVALL RC 5CENTRIFUGE WITH GSA ROTOR DURING 30 MINUTES.11 THE ABOVE LIQUIDS WERE STERILELY EVACUATED ANDCOLLECTED IN BOTTLES OF 3 LITERS.12 HERETO CACL2 AND NACL WERE ADDED AT CONCENTRATIONS OF RESP. 0.02 M AND 0.13 M AND SUBSEQUENTLY 8 ML OF 0.25M SODIUM INOSITOL HEXAPHOSPHATE SOLUTION WERE ADDED TO 3 LITERS, THE PH OF WHICH BEING ADJUSTED AT 8,0 WITHDILUTE HCL, SO THAT IHP HB WAS NOW 0.5 1. NOW 1 M NAOHWAS ADDED UNTIL THE PH WAS 9.05. A PRECIPITATE FORMED CA IHP, MEMBRANE PROTEINS .THE IHP NA SALT HAD BEEN PURCHASED FROM SIGMA CHEMICALS ST. LOUIS, MO, 63178, USA 13 IN A SORVALL CENTRIFUGE CENTRIFUGING WAS DONE AT 27,000 G DURING 20 MINUTES.14 THE ABOVE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTIONS WERE CAREFULLYEVACUATED AND COMBINED.15 WITH 1 M HCL THE PH WAS ADJUSTED AT 7,0. AGAIN APRECIPITATE FORMED PROTEIN .16 AGAIN CENTRIFUGING WAS DONE AT 27,000 G DURING 30 MINUTES.17 THE ABOVE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTIONS WERE EVACUATED ANDCOMBINED.18 pREVIOUS TO CONCENTRATING THE SOLUTION WAS NOWFILTERED THROUGH PRE FILTERS AND ULTRA FILTERS HAVINGPORES OF 0.8us. 19 THE SOLUTION WAS CONCENTRATED BY ULTRA FILTRATIONBY MEANS OF SHAFTS OF HOLLOW FIBRES APPARATUS AMICONDC 2 WITH H1P10 8 CARTRIDGES . THIS WAS CONTINUEDUNTIL A HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION OF 10 M WAS ATTAINED. 0 NOW NADH IN WATER WAS ADDED, ABOUT 7 G IN TOTAL, SO T THE MOLAR RATIO NADHHB WAS NOW 0,5 1.21 NOW HB, PH, PRO2, NA, K1 CL AND FREE IONISED CALCIUMDETERMINED DIRECTLY MEASURED AND THE PH1 PCO2 AND THEBOCARBONATE CONTENT WERE DETERMINED WITH THE ASTRUPTECHNIQUE.22 THE OBTAINED LIQUID WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE ROUGHLYEQUAL PARTS. FROM THE RESULTS OF THE DETERMINATIONS 21 IT WAS CALCULATED HOW MUCH OF THE VARIOUS IONS SHOULD BEADDED TO OBTAIN A COMPOSITION AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THATOF BLOOD PLASMA.23 NOW NACL, KCL, CACL2 AND NAHCO3 WERE ADDED, SO THAT INEACH PORTION THE RELATION BETWEEN PH AND PRO 2 WAS KNOWN. PBAR 760 MMHG PH PCO2 101,3 KPA0 7.20 60 MMHG 8.00 KPA 7.40 40 MMHG 5.33 KPA 7.60 20 MMHG 2.67 KPA 24 TO EACH PORTION SO MUCH IHP WAS ADDED THAT FOR EACHPH PCO2 COMBINATION THE P50 WAS ABOUT 26.5 MMHG 3.53KPA FOR THIS PURPOSE ADD THEE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF IHPAND DETERMINE THE P02 AT A CONSTANT PCO2, WHEREAFTER BYINTRAPOLATION THE DESIRED IHP CONCENTRATION IS FOUND P02 IS A FUNCTION OFHIHP 25 THEN CENTRIFUGING WAS DONE AGAIN IN A SORVALL CENTRIFUGE AT 27,Q00 G DURING 20 MINUTES.26 THE ABOVE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION WAS EVACUATED ANDSTERILIZED BY FILTRATION THROUGH AN ULTRA FILTER HAVING PORES OF 0.22 pM. 27 THE PRODUCT WAS STERILELY DISTRIBUTED OVER BOTTLESWITH RUBBER LUGS.THE PRODUCT CONTAINES 8,0.10 M OF HB, OF WHICH LESSTHAN 2 WAS METHEMOGLOBIN AFTER 1 YEAR IN THEREFRIGERATOR LESS THAN 7 a . THE HEMOGLOBIN YIELD INTHIS CASE WAS ABOUT 60 S. IT CONTAINED 0.21 M OF NA 0.011 M OF K AND 0.16 M OF CL . IT CONTAINED EXTREMELY FEW DISCRETE PARTICLES,WHICH ANYHOW WERE SMALLER THAN 0.22 eM. AFTER 251 FOLDDILUTED WITH HICN REAGENT IT WAS FOUND 1 CM E750 N 0.0002 AND E540lE514 1.59. THE RELATION BETWEEN P50 AND PH WAS THE SAME AS IS KNOWNFROM THE LITERATURE, AND THE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENTSFOR PH, PCO2 AND P02 WERE APROXIMATELY THOSE OF BLOOD.EXAMPLE II 1 BOVINE BLOOD WAS MADE NON CLOTTING WITH A HEPARINSOLUTION 550 ML OF BLOOD 3 ML OF SOLUTION .2 11 EXACTLY AS WITH EXAMPLE I.12 TO THE HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTION CACL2 AND NACL WERE ADDEDAT CONCENTRATIONS OF RESP. 0.02 M AND 0.13 M ANDSUBSEQUENTLY IN TOTAL ABOUT 3.5 ML OF 0.25 M NA IHP THEPH OF WHICH WAS FIRST ADJUSTED AT 8.0 WITH DILUTE HCL. THE PH OF THIS MIXTURE WAS 7.4.13 A SLIGHT HAZE WAS REMOVED BY CENTRIFUGING AT 27,000 C DURING 20 MINUTES.14 24 WERE EXACTLY AS 17 27 OF EXAMPLE I.THE PROPERTIES OF THIS COMPOSITION WERE SUBSTANTIALLYEQUAL TO THOSE OF THE COMPOSITION OF EXAMPLE I.
