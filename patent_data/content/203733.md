# Improvements in or relating to dielectric fluids.

## Abstract
Dielectric fluid containing from 5 to 40 molar percent of a first arene compound having up to seven substituent alkenyl carbon atoms and from 60 to 95 molar percent of a diluent. The diluent can be mineral oil, a second arene compound having up to seven substituent alkyl carbon atoms which are hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon ethers or a mixture thereof, or a mixture of a mineral oil and the second arene compound. Also preferably included in the dielectric fluid is from 0.5 to 5 of a free radical polymerization inhibitor. A capacitor and a transformer containing the dielectric fluid are also included.
