## Description
Process for the preparation of cC L aspartyl L phe nylalanine alkyl esters The present invention relates to a new process for preparing t L aspartyl L phenylalanine alkyl esters of formula IEMI1.1 wherein R represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. In a particularly preferred aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing oFL aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester I, whereinR CH3 or aspartame. Aspartame is a well known sweetening agent widely used as dietetic sweetening agent, due to its taste very similar to that of saccharose. Dipeptides of formula I are known to be prepared starting from L aspartic acid derivatives. According to a known method, the process is carried out starting from L aspartic acid in which both the NH2 and B and W carboxylic groups have been pro tected by means, for example, of benzyloxycarbonyl or formyl or 4 nitrophenylester groups by reaction with a L phenylalanine ester the 4 nitrophenol is removed and the protected dipeptide is obtained, from which the other protecting groups can be remo ved by such conventional techniques as hydrogenolysis. However, selective esterification of the ss car boxylic group of L aspartic acid is difficult to perform and, moreover, it takes place in low yields on the other hand to produce aspartame it is necessary that condensation should occur only on the t carboxylic group. According to another known method a N protectedL aspartic anhydride is employed as the starting material however condensation of said anhydride with aminoacids or aminoacid esters namely, L phenylalanine methyl ester followed by removal of the protec ting group, always gives a and ss isomers in admixture which must be subsequently separated. The drawbacks of the methods according to the prior art are overcome by the process of the present invention, which allows to obtain easily and in high yields L aspartyl L phenylalanine alkyl esters, by means of a condensation occurring exclusively at po sition a. The main advantage of the process according to the invention is that, instead of L aspartic acid derivatives, there are employed as starting productsL asparagine derivatives, i.e. derivatives from a commercially available natural product having the Bcarboxylic group already blocked. According to the invention, a L asparagine derivative of formula II , in which the amino group has been protected, is condensed with a L phenylala nine alkyl ester III to give a dipeptide derivati ve IV the amido group of which is selectively transformed intbacarboxylic group, the final step of de protection of the amino group taking place by isola ting or not the resulting intermediate V , as shown in the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 in which X represents a group protecting the amino moiety Y represents OH or an activating atom or group R has the above defined meanings andAr represents a phenyl group. More particularly, X represents A haloacyl, formyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or trimethylsilyl groups Y represents hydroxy, alcoxycarbonyloxy, o nitrophe noxy or O N succinimido groups. Both X and Y can be inserted in the L asparagine molecule easily and in high yields, the resulting derivatives being generally crystalline compounds which can be easily iso lated in a pure form. The condensation of the L asparagine derivative II with a L phenylalanine alkyl ester III is conveniently carried out under different conditions, depending on the nature of the Y group. When Y OH, the condensation with compound III may be advantageously carried out with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in the presence of N hydroxy succinimide, in reaction mediums such as dimethylformamide.Alternatively, the same condensation may also be effected using pivaloyl chloride in the presence of tertiary bases, such as pyridine and N ethylpiperidi ne, in solvents such as methylene chloride or dimethylformamide. On the other hand, when Y o nitrophenyl, the condensation may be carried out by simple treatment with compound III at room temperature, for example in acetonitrile pyridine as the solvent. The reaction mixture is concentrated under vacuum, then diluted with water and the resulting dipeptide IV is recovered by filtration. The dipeptide may be subsequently washed with a sodium carbonate solution, with diluted hydrochloric acid and with wa ter and it may be used as such for the next step or it can be optionally recrystallized with, for exam ple, methanol. The conversion of asparaginyl dipeptide IV in aspartyl dipeptide V is carried out with nitroso nium salts, such as nitrosyl tetrafluoborate or sulfate, or with inorganic or organic nitrites in the presence of mineral acids. The reaction is advantageously carried out by treating compound IV with nitrosylsulfuric acid in glacial acetic acid, or in acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, at room temperature for about 4 hours, under strong stirring. Compound V may be precipitated by addition of ice water and recovered by filtration. Alternatively, from the intermediates IV the L aspa raginyl L phenylalanine esters having formula IVa EMI5.1 wherein R and Ar have the above defined meanings may be obtained.Such esters may be, on their turn, protected at the amino group with alternative X groups, constituting the reference mainly from the optical purity point of view for the reaction products 11 III . The final compound I is obtained from the in termediate V by removing the protecting groupX from the nitrogen atom of the amino group, accor ding to standard procedures. Thus, for X benzyloxycarbonyl, an hydrogenolysis with palladium charcoal 5 10t is carried out, for example in me thanol water or acetic acid water solution. If, on the contrary, X is trimethylsilyl or formyl, the deprotection may be carried out by heating in acid medium. In this case, when the transformation of the CONH2 group into carboxylic group is over, and optionally after destroying of the excess N02 ion, the elimination of the formyl or trimethylsilyl group without isolating the intermediate V , can be directly carried out. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, X represents an O haloacyl residue such as, for example, chloroacetyl, W bromo or DL chlo ropropionyl, bromo or W chlorohexanoyl and the like . In this case, after the transformation of the CONH2 group into carboxyl group, the elimina tion of the tX haloacyl group is carried out by treatment with thiourea and decomposition of the resulting isothiouronium salt, according to the schemeEMI6.1 wherein R and Ar have the above defined meanings,Hal is an halogen atom preferably chlorine or bro mine , while R is hydrogen or C1 C5 linear or bran ched alkyl residue. The recovery of the isothiouronium salt VI is not necessary since the preparation of the final esters I from the haloacyl derivatives Va , turns out to be very easy without isolating said salts, by direct treatment with water at pH 7 8, at temperatures ranging from 20 to 600 C, preferably about 400 C. Anyway particularly pure esters I are obtained in very good total yields. Namely, by operating according to the invention, aspartame I, R CH3 free from the beta form is obtained, with an average yield of 60 75 on the starting asparagine. The following non limitative examples are reported for sake of illustration of the process according to the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 a Benzyloxycarbonyl a L asparaginyl L phenylala nine IV, wherein R CH3 and X CO O CH2 C6H5 77.5 Grams of benzyloxycarbonyl L asparagine o nitrophenylester tI, wherein X CO O CH2 C6H5 and Y 2 nitrophenoxy was added at room temperature to a solution containing 65 g of L phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride in 2 liters of a mixture 1 1 acetonitrile pyridine.
