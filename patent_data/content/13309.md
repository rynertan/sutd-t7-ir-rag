# Electrolysis of aqueous solution of potassium chloride.

## Abstract
An electrolysis of an aqueous solution of potassium chloride is carried out by employing a fluorinated cation exchange membrane having an ion exchange capacity of 0.8 to 2.0 meq g dry polymer and having carboxylic acid groups as functional groups and maintaining a concentration of an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide in a cathode com partment in a range of 20 to 45 wt. and maintaining a cal cium concentration in the aqueous solution of potassium chloride to lower than 0.05 mg liter. The purification of the aqueous solution of potassium chloride to reduce the calcium concentration is carried out in a system comprising a chelate ion exchange substance.
