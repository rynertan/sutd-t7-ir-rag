# Method of color electrophotography.

## Abstract
This invention is a method of color electrophotography in which toner images are superposed sequentially on a photosen sitive material sheet to form a multi color image by using a liquid developer. According to this method, the photosensitive material sheet is made to pass by a conductive doctor member and then by an air blasting member in sequence immediately after development, so as to form the multi color image. By this method, the multi color image can be formed in the condition that most of a excess developer is removed while a small quantity of carrier liquid containing no residual toner particles is made to exist as a uniform liquid layer on the surface of the photosensitive material sheet, and thus a clear image free from a fogging of the surface can be obtained.
