# Production of S aryl S alkyl dithiocarbonates, arenethiols and arythioethers.

## Abstract
An S aryl S alkyl dithiocarbonate is prepared by pyroly tically isomerising an O aryl S alkyl dithiocarbonate at a temperature in the range 150 600 C. The reaction product may be hydrolysed to form an arenethiol or may be further reacted with an alcohol in the presence of a basic catalyst to form an aryl thioether.
