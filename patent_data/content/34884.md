# A valving arrangement.

## Abstract
A valving arrangement for use in the production of an aerated product such as chocolate, in which the product is pressurized with a gas, preferably a soluble gas such as car bon dioxide, wherein the valving arrangement includes a first valve plate 22 having a tapered orifice 22A therein, a sec ond valve plate 25 which is adjustable relative to the first plate in a plane transverse to the axis of the tapered orifice, and having a corresponding tapered orifice 25A therein, the axis of which is parallel to the first axis, whereby the flow passage through these orifices can be preadjusted. Means are provided to close off the flow passage through the orifices abruptly without altering the preadjustment of the flow pas sage. This can be achieved by inserting a rod 16, 30 into the upstream orifice or by moving the valve plate a greater dis tance than the diameters of the orifices.
