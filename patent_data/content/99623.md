# Optical waveguide terminating apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Optical waveguide terminating apparatus applies a pair of connectors of the type comprising plug members 1 having metal retention sleeves 3 therein to the ends of an optical waveguide cable 7 having the jacket 9 stripped to expose the fiber 8 . Plug members 1 are delivered to an insertion station attached to a metal carrier strip 6 and are clamped securely between an upper clamp 92 and an anvil 100 which move together vertically under the action of followers 91, 101 riding in cam slots 32, 35 in a moving cam block 30 , which also determines movement of other components. Cable 7 is positioned relative to insertion station by aligning exposed fibers 8 in narrow channels 117 in top of shear bar 110 and aligning jacket 9 in primary cable guide channels 121 in guide block 210 adjacent the shear bar 110 , which has a slot 114 therein through which said strip 6 passes. The shear bar 110 drops to shear the strip 6 from sleeves 3 and aligns a secondary cable guide channel 116 above fiber guide channel 117 in block 110 with primary channel 121 . Two pairs of cam actuated jaws 50, 70 grip the cable 8 and advance the ends through channels 116, 121 toward the insertion station. The channels 116, 121 drop away during this advance to permit the jaws 50, 70 to fully insert the cable ends in the plug member 1 as the jaws 50, 70 push retention sleeve 3 fully into plug member 1 to seat it on lances 4 on the sleeve 3 . Resilient springs 150 bear on the jaws 50, 70 so that cable ends are pulled back to seat them on lances 5 in the retention sleeves 3 .
