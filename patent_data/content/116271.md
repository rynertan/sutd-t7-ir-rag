# Method of and apparatus for manufacturing small size gas filled lamps.

## Abstract
A lamp bulb has a closed lens shaped head received in a recess in a bulb holder jig and an open end held by a heating carbon jig. A bead supporting a pair of lead wires with a filament connected thereto is disposed in the open end of the bulb, with the lead wires being supported on a lead wire holder. The jigs and holder are housed in a chamber in which a vacuum is developed. A gas to be filled in the bulb is introduced into the chamber under a desired pressure irrespective of atmospheric pressure. Then, an electric current is passed through the heating carbon jig to heat the latter for fusing the open end of the bulb and the bead, and at the same time the closed end of the bulb is cooled by the bulb holder jig which is supplied with a coolant liquid. After the bulb and the bead have been fused together, the electric current flowing through the heating carbon jig is cut off to stop the heating of the heating carbon jig. Then, the chamber is removed, and the completed lamp is taken out. A number of such gas filled lamps can easily be mass produced by placing the lamp components in the chamber at a time, without producing defective products.
