# Record player comprising a control device for the pick up arm.

## Abstract
In a record player the control device for the pick up arm 4 comprises a command disc 12 60 which is rotatable by a motor and to which is connected a reciprocable drive ele ment 16 62 . A guide element 48 78 is pivotally connect ed to the drive element, and is engageable with a coupling element 53 63b on a pick up arm base 43 63 to move the pick up arm 4 towards the turntable 2 . The control device further comprises a pivotal selection member 29 66 hav ing first 31 71 and second 32 72 positioning surfaces which are selectively cooperable with an abutment 57 64 on the base 43 63 of the pick up arm 4 in order to posi tion the pick up arm 4 selectively in a first or second posi tion respectively above the turntable 2 . The guide element 48 78 is pivotable between two stable positions, namely an inoperative first position which it occupies during the for ward movement of the drive element 16 62 and an opera tive second position which it occupies during at least a part of the return movement of the drive element, in which sec ond position the guide element is engageable with the coupling element 53 63b to guide the pick up arm 4 . At the end of the forward movement of the drive element 16 62 the guide element 48 78 abuts a stop 56 81 to be pi voted thereby to the second position. During the return movement of the drive element 16 62 , after abutment of the abutment 57 64 on the pick up arm base with one or the other of the positioning surfaces 31, 32 71, 72 the guide element 48, 78 is pivoted out of the second position and is thus disengaged from the coupling element 53, 63b , after which the selection member 29 66 is pivoted out of the path of the abutment 57 64 on the pick up arm base 43 63 by the command disc 12 60 .
