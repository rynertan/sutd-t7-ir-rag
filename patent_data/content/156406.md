# IC socket contact.

## Abstract
A specialized contact structure is provided for IC sockets to permit increased contact pressure and to permit contact with an IC lead at its base instead of at its tip. The socket includes a substrate with the subject contacts embedded therein in rows, an overlying lever actuated plate having cor responding rows of apertures, with the apertures corre sponding to IC lead positions. In operation, the IC leads are inserted into the apertures in the lever actuated plate and the plate with the inserted leads is moved laterally, such that the leads are moved laterally into contact with the mating contact arms of the contacts mounted in the substrate. In order to provide reliable contact with the base of the lead, each con tact has a leg portion extending outwardly from the substrate, with the contact being formed from contact arms in the form of a pair of opposing rectangular tongue pieces integrally formed with the leg portion, and abutment portions formed by inwardly bending the tips of the tongue pieces by an angle more than 90 degrees so that the tips of the contact arms come into contact with each other to form a spring loaded contact adjacent the top of the tongue pieces. The sides of the spring loaded contact into which an IC lead is to be lat erally moved has a V shaped face to guide the IC lead in between the contact arms, with a laterally running top edge bevel being provided on each of the mating inwardly bent contact arms.
