# Valve assembly.

## Abstract
A water type valve for securing to a flange fitting comprises a valve body 20 having a flowway therethrough, connection formations 52 integrally adjoining the valve body, a valve element 34 mounted in the flowway, and an annular valve seat 25 which lines the flowway for sealing engagement with the valve element. A seat retainer 30 axially abuts the valve seat and one end of the valve body to locate the valve seat, and seat retainer mounting means 70,71 adjoining the valve body and extending outwardly therefrom, axially overlap the seat retainer. First connectors 54,74,77 cooperate between the connection formations and the seat retainer mounting means to connect the mounting means to the valve body and thereby mount the seat retainer to the valve body, whilst second connectors connect the valve assembly to the flange fitting.
