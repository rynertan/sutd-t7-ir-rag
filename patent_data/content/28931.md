# Process for producing resorcinol.

## Abstract
When producing resorcinol by cleaving m diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide in the presence of a water soluble acid catalyst in a mixed solvent consisting of an aromatic hydrocarbon and acetone, treating the resulting acid cleavage product containing resorcinol with an aqueous solution of a neutral salt under acidic conditions, separating a solvent layer containing resorcinol from an aqueous layer, and recovering resorcinol from the separated solvent layer a high yield of resorcinol can be obtained smoothly and without increasing distillation loads during separation of resorcinol from the separated solvent layer, or plugging, contamination or corrosion of the apparatus, by i carrying out acid cleavage while maintaining the weight ratio of the aromatic hydrocarbon to acetone at less than 0.6 1 and after formation of the acid cleavage product but before the treatment of the cleavage product with the aqueous solution of the neutral salt, adjusting the amount of the aromatic hydrocarbon in the mixed solvent so that the weight ratio of the aromatic hydrocarbon to acetone in the product is from 0.6 1 to 1.1 1, and ii selecting the acidic conditions so that the pH of the solvent layer containing resorcinol is 2.5 to 4.
