# Method of and apparatus for magnetic recording detection.

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording system utilizing a non return to zero format the reproduced recording is fed to positive and negative threshold detectors TA1, TA2 having no need for electrical hysteresis as well as, via differentiator means DF , to a zero crossing detector TA3 . The signal from the positive threshold detector and one polarity of the signal from the zero crossing detector are used to trigger a latch means L1, L2 to a first state to emit a signal having a first level, and the signal from the negative threshold detector and the other polarity of the signal from the zero crossing detector are used to trigger the latch means to a second state whereby the signal emitted by the latch means is switched to a second level.
