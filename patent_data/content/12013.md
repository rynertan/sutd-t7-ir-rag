# A planting tray.

## Abstract
A planting tray comprises a flat imperforate base 10 on an upper surface 11 of which a cell structure 12 rests, the cell structure being for filling with a planting medium, such as compost. The cell structure 12 is composed of a plurality of generally planar divider members 13 detachably connected together by means of slots 14 therein, each slot being cham fered where it opens onto an edge of the respective divider member 13 to permit the easy insertion of another divider member therein. Seedlings or plants which have been grown in the individual cells of the cell structure 12 are prepared for transplating by the simple expedient of detaching the divider members 13 from one another by moving each divider member in its respective general plane, thereby leaving the individual root balls intact on the base 10. Damage to the root balls is thus obviated, and the planting tray can therefore be used to grow plants which cannot normally be transplanted due to the danger of root damage.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A planting tray comprising a flat base and a cell structure on the base for filling with planting medium, characterised in that the base 10 is substantially imperforate and has at least one open edge, and the cell structure 12 is composed of a plurality of mutually intersecting, generally planar divider members 13 which are detachably connected together so that they can be detached from one another by movement in their respective general planes without substantial disturbance of the plant ing medium. 2. A planting tray as claimed in claim 1, wherein the divider members 13 are slotted to permit their detachable connection together. 3. A planting tray as claimed in claim 2, wherein the slots 14 in each divider member 13 open onto a common edge of the latter. 4. A planting tray as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein each slot 14 is chamfered where it.opens onto an edge of the respective divider member 13 . 5. A planting tray as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the base 10 and the divider members 13 are made of a durable material, such as a plastics material.

## Description
This invention relates to a planting tray principally for use as a seed tray. According to the present invention, there is provided a planting tray comprising a flat, substantially impel forate base having at least one open edge, and a cell structure composed of a plurality of mutually intersecting, generally planar divider members which are detachably connectible together in such a manner that, when the cell structure is rested on the base and is filled with planting medium in use, the divider members can be detached from one another by movement in their respective general planes without substantial disturbance of the planting medium. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of examplevwith reference to the accompanying drawing, which is an exploded perspective view of a seed tray according to the present invention. Referring to the drawing, the illustrated seed tray comprises a rigid imperforate base 10 whose upper surface 11 is flat and substantially free from surface blemishes, the base being square or rectangular and having all four of its edges open. Restable on the upper surface 11 is a cell structure 12 which is composed of a plurality in this case, twelve of generally planar divider members 13. The cell structure 12 defines a 5 x 5 grid of individual planting cells in each of which one or more seeds, seedlings,etc can be.planted. The divider members 13 are slotted so as to enable them to be detachably connected together. In fact, each divider member 13 has six equi spaced slots 14 therein which open onto a common edge of the divider member.The cell structure is assembled in use by placing six of the divider members in laterally spaced, parallel relation with their slots opening upwardly, by orienting the remaining six divider members at right angles to the slot up divider members with the slots therein opening downwardly, and by engaging the slots in each of the slot dowai√ß divider members with respective slots in all six of the nslot up divider members. To facilitate such engagement, the slots are chamfered or tapered where they open out onto the edge of the respective divider member. This tapering also facilitates drainage and watering by submersion so that no drainage holes need be provided in the base 10.Such holes are undesirable, since they may allow plant roots to grow therethrough and thus impede the subsequent removal of the root balls from the base. Each divider member 13 has two holes 15 at either end thereof which enables it be hung up for storage. The base 10 and the divider members 13 are preferably made of plastics material, for example a medium impact styrene. In use, the assembled cell structure 12 is placed on the upper surface 11 of the base 10, and the cells therein are filled with planting medium e.g. compost up to the level of the upper edges of the divider members 13. Seeds, seedlings or the like are then. sown or planted in the cell structure, preferably at the rate of two per cell. When the resultant plants are ready for planting out, the slot down divider members are removed from the cell structure by moving them upwardly i.e. away from the base 10 . The slot up divider members 13 are then removed from the planting medium by sliding them along the base 10 in their direction of extent, thereby leaving twenty five individual root balls and their associated plants on the upper surface 11 of the base.These root balls can then be slid off the base 10 and into a planting hole at the planting site as required.The seed tray is then ready for re use. The seed tray described above is advantageous in that it enables the plants grown in it to be planted out without disturbing their roots, and is therefore useful for growing plants which cannot normally be transplanted due to the danger of root damage. The seed tray is simple in construction, versatile in its application, and is easy to clean since its component parts have flat surfaces. Moreover, its re usability avoids the wastage which has previously been associated with disposable seed trays. Fhrthermores although in the above described embodiment the cells of the cell structure are of equal size, it is possible to provide larger cells where necessary by removing one or more of the divider members 13. In addition, because the component parts are detachable from each other, the seed tray can be sold in kit form for assembly by a purchaser.
