## Abstract
Cardiac and vascular prostheses and methods of making the same. The prostheses are suitable for implantation in a bloody environment. The prosthesis includes a surface material adapted for exhibiting a regular and periodic surface charge characteristic in the bloody environment See Fig. 1A scanning electron micrographs of an albumin Dacron hybrid graft . A prothesis means supports the surface material and is adapted to perform a prosthetic function in the bloody environment. In cases where cross linking is desired and the surface material cannot cross link with the substrate material, an adaptive material is provided which cross links both to the surface material and to the material of the prothesis.
