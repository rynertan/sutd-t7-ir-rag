## Description
Title CLAY MINERAL TYPE COLOR DEVELOPER COMPOSITION FOR PRESSURE SENSITIVE RECORDING SHEETSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a color devr composition which demonstrates pronounced color developement effects when used in making pressuresensitive recording sheets which can produce copies by handwriting, printing or typing without the use of conventional carbon paper.2. Description of the Prior Art Pressure sensitive recording sheets, except a few special cases, utilize a color development reaction ascribable to the transfer of electrons between a colorless organic dye compound having electron donating property and a color developer acting as an electron acceptor U. S. Patent No. 2,548,366 . Generally, two kinds of dyes which assume different states of coloration are used together as the colorless dye compound. One of them is a dye, such as a triphenylmethane phthalide dye, which forms an intense color immediately upon contact with a solid acid, but the color fades easily primary color forming dye . The other is a dye which does not immediately form a color upon contact with a solid acid but completely develops its color several days thereafter with sufficient fastness to sunlight. An example is a leucomethylene blue dye secondary color forming dye . Crystal violet lactone CVL is a typical primary color forming dye. As the secondary colorforming dye, benzoyl leucomethylene blue BLMB is widely used. In recent years, fluoran type green or black dyes, Michler s hydrol derivatives such as Michler s hydrl para toluenesulfinate PTSMH , diphenylcarbazolylmethane dyes and spirodibenzopyran dyes have also been used either singly or in combination with the aforesaid primary color forming dye. Solid acids are generally used as the color developer which is an electron acceptor. It is known that above all, dioctahedral montmorillonite clay minerals show excellent color developing ability. Acid clay and sub bentonite are especially preferred as the dioctahedral montmorillonite clay minerals. It has been known that the specific surface area of montmorillonite clay minerals such as acid clay and sub bentonite can be increased to 180 m g or higher by treating them with acids, and the acid treated clay minerals exhibit increased color developing ability with respect to primary color forming dyes such as triphenylmethane phthalide dyes. For instance, the acid treated acid clay is generally referred to as activated acid clay, and known widely as a coloring developer for pressure sensitive recording paper. Both inorganic and organic acids can be used in the acid treatment, but inorganic acids, particularly sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, are preferred because of their reasonable cost and the ease of handling. The acid treating conditions are not critical.If a diluted acid is used, either the treating time becomes longer or the quantity of the required acid increases. On the other hand, if an acid of high concentration is used, either the treating time becomes shorter or the quantity of the acid required becomes smaller. If the treating temperature is high, the treating time can be shortened. Hence, the acid concentration can be freely selected within the range of 1 to 98 . It is known however that in practice, the acid treatment is preferably carried out at an acid concentration of about 15 to 80 and at a temperature of 50 to 3000C because of the ease of handling.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided color developer romposition for pressure sensitive recording needs, comprising 1 a color developer which is derived from a clay mineral having a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica and which shows t diffraction pattern attributable to the crystals of layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica when subjected to an electron diffraction analysis, but B substantially no diffraction pattern attributable to the crystals of said layer structure when subjected to an X ray diffraction analysis, and which C contains at least silicon and magnesium and or aluminum in addition to oxygen, and 2 0.2 to 2 millimoles, per gram of the components 1 and 2 combined, of at least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of the oxides and hydroxides of calcium, magnesium and zinc.

The color developer 1 and a method of its production are disclosed in detail in U. S. PatentNo.4,405,371 European Laid Open Patent PublicationNo. 0044645A1 . The color developer 1 in accordance with this invention can be produced, for example, through the steps of acid treating a clay mineral having a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica until its SiO2 content reaches 82 96.5 by weight, preferably 85 95 by weight, on dry basis drying at 1050C. for 3 hours , contacting the resulting clay mineral, in an aqueous medium, with a magnesium and or aluminum compound at least partially soluble in the aqueous medium, neutralizing the treated product with an alkali or an acid to form a hydroxide when the soluble compound is not a hydroxide, thereby introducing a magnesium and or an aluminum component into the acid treated clay mineral, and if desired, drying the product. The compositions of typical clay minerals having the layer structures composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica are as shown in Table A below, in which the contents of SiO2, A1203 and MgO as the main components are given. Table AEMI6.1 tb SEP SiO2 SEP Al2O3 SEP MgO tb Dioctahedral SEP montmorillo tb nite SEP acid SEP clay, SEP bentonite, SEP 50 SEP SEP 70 SEP 15 SEP SEP 22 SEP 1 SEP SEP 5 tb etc. tb Kaolin SEP 40 SEP SEP 50 SEP 32 SEP SEP 40 SEP 0 SEP SEP 1 tb Halloysite SEP 35 SEP SEP 45 SEP 32 SEP SEP 40 SEP 0 SEP SEP 1 tb Attapulgite SEP 50 SEP SEP 60 SEP 5 SEP SEP 12 SEP i SEP 5 SEP SEP 12 tb These clay minerals having a layer structures composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica show a unique diffraction pattern characteristic of the crystals of the layer structure, when subjected to an X ray diffraction analysis.In particular, a diffraction pattern attributable to the crystal faces havingMiller s indices of 020 , 200 and 060 appears most distinctly. According to the present invention, the clay mineral having a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica is intensely acid treated until its SiO2 content reaches 82 96.5 by weight, preferably 85 95 by weight, on dry basis drying at 1050C. for 3 hours . It is preferred according to this invention that the acid treatment should be continued until the acid treated clay mineral in dry state shows substantially no diffraction pattern attributable to the already specified crystal faces of the crystals having a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica which the untreated clay mineral has, when subjected to an X ray diffraction analysis. It is particularly preferred that the acid treatment should be performed until not only the X ray diffraction analysis but also an electron diffraction analysis of the acid treated clay mineral no longer substantially show the characteristic diffraction patterns attributable to the crystals of the layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica which the untreated clay mineral has. The clay mineral which has been acid treated as above is then contacted in an aqueous medium with a magnesium and or an aluminum compound at least partially soluble in the aqueous medium. If the soluble compound is not a hydroxide, the treated product is neutralized with an alkali or acid so that a hydroxide of magnesium and or aluminum is formed therein, thereby introducing a magnesium and or aluminum component into the acid treated clay mineral. The product is thereafter dried, if desired. The foregoing procedure gives the color developer 1 in accordance with this invention which is derived from a clay mineral having a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica and which shows A a diffraction pattern attributable to the crystals of layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica when subjected to an electron diffraction analysis, but B substantially no diffraction pattern attributable to the crystals of said layer structure when subjected to an X ray diffraction analysis, and which C contains at least silicon and magnesium and or aluminum in addition to oxygen. Preferably, the color developer 1 used in this invention contains at least silicon and magnesium in addition to oxygen in regard to the requirement C . Preferably, the color developer 1 used in this invention, which satisfies the conditions A , B and C , further meets the requirement that it contains silicon and magnesium and or aluminum in such proportions that the atomic ratio of silicon to magnesium and or aluminum is from 12 1.5 to 12 12, particulary from 12 3 to 12 10 requirement D . Typical examples of the clay mineral of a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica which is used as a raw material for the production of the color developer 1 are given below. 1 Dioctahedral and trioctahedral montmoril lonite clay minerals such as acid clay, bentonite, beidellite, nontronite and saponite 2 kaolinite clay minerals such as kaolin, halloysite, dickite and nacrite 3 sepiolite palygorskite clay minerals such as sepiolite, attapulgite and palygorskite 4 chlorite clay minerals such as leuchten bergite, sheridanite, thuringite and chamosite and 5 vermiculite clay minerals such as vermicu lite, magnesium vermiculite and aluminum vermiculite. Preferred among them are dioctahedral montmorillonite clay minerals such as acid clay, kaolinite clay minerals such as kaolin and halloysite, and chain clay minerals such as attapulgite. As already mentioned,it has been the long practice to use the color developer 2 , i.e., montmorillonite clay minerals, particularly acid clay, which have been treated with mineral acids such as sulfuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids, most commonly sulfuric acid, as a color developer, for pressuresensitive recording sheets. When an acid clay is treated with such a mineral acid as mentioned above, the acid soluble basic metal components in the developer, for example, such metal components as aluminum, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and manganese which are present predominantly in the form of oxides or hydroxides dissolve in the mineral acid, and consequently the SiO2 content of the acid clay increases. If the acid treatment is performed to a high degree intensely to dissolve and remove too much of the basic metal components, the resulting acid treated and clay which also known as activated acid clay decreased in its color developing ability with respect to a secondary color development, and the light resistance of a developed color of a primary color development dye e.g., CVL in the main is markedly deteriorated. Accordingly, the degree of acid treatment of acid clay is inherently limited, and under the conventionally adopted acid treating conditions, the resulting acid treated product activated clay has aSiO2 content of about 68 78 by weight. Even under considerably rigorous acid treating conditions, theSiO2 content is at most about 80 by weight. On the other hand, it has been known of old that the aforementioned montmorillonite clay minerals, kaolinite clay minerals, sepiolite palygorskite clay minerals, chlorite clay minerals and vermiculite clay minerals have crystals of layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica, and hence, when examined by X ray or electron diffraction analysis, they give unique diffraction patterns ascribable to the crystals of layer structure Mineralogical Society Clay Mineral Group , London, 1961, The X Ray Identification and Crystal Structures of Clay Minerals, ed. byG. Brown0. When those clay minerals having the crystals of layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica are acid treated to such an advanced degree that their SiO2 contents reach 82 96.5 by weight, particularly 85 95 by weight, on dry basis e.g., after a drying at 1050C. for 3 hours , their crystals of layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica are gradually destroyed as the acid treatment progresses, until, when the SiO2 content reaches 82 by weight or higher, particularly 85 by weight or higher, the treated clay minerals no longer show the diffraction pattern characteristic of the crystals of such layerstructure in X ray or electron diffraction analysis. Of course, the correlations among the degree of acid treatment, destruction of the crystals having the layer structure and the ultimately occurring substantial disappearance of the characteristic diffraction patterns vary depending on the type and purity of clay minerals, pre treating conditions which may be applied before the acid treatment e.g., sintering and grinding conditions , etc. and are by no means definite. In all cases, however, as the acid treatment proceeds beyond a certain degree, the destruction of crystals having the layer structure begins and progresses to result Ultimately in the substantial disappearance of the diffraction patterns attributable to the aforesaid crystals. In acid treating, for example, montmorillonite clay minerals for making a color developer color developer 2 used in the invention for pressuresensitive recording paper, it has been previously considered essential to select such acid treating conditions as would not cause destruction of crystalline structure of the clay minerals, because otherwise the color developing ability of the color developer would be seriously reduced te.g., Journal of IndustrialChemistry Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi , Vol. 67, No. 7 1964 pp. 67 71 . Investigations of the present inventors, however, led to the discovery that the color developer 1 for pressure sensitive recording sheets can be produced by 1 intensely acid treating a clay mineral having a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica, until its SiO2 content reaches at least 82 by weight, preferably at least 85 by weight, on dry basis drying at 105 C. for 3 hours for convenience, referred to as the first step , and then 2 contacting the resulting clay mineral, in an aqueous medium, with a magnesium and or an aluminum compound which is at least partially soluble in the aqueous medium, neutralizing the treated product with an alkali or an acid to form a hydroxide when the soluble compound employed is not a hydroxide, thereby introducing into the acid treated clay mineral a magnesium and or a aluminum component particularly the magnesium compound, and if desired, drying the product referred to as the second step for convenience . It is important in the first step that A the clay mineral should be so acidtreated that its SiO2 content should reach 82 96.5 by weight, preferably 85 95 by weight, on dry basis drying at 1050C. for 3 hours , and B more preferably it should be so acidtreated as to have a SiO2 content within the abovespecified range, and furthermore until it shows substantially no diffraction pattern attributable to the crystals of layer structure. composed of regular tetrahedrons of siica possessed by the starting clay mineral before the acid treatment , when examined by X ray diffraction. According to our studies, if the acid treatment is performed too rigorously until th SiO2 content of the acid treated clay mineral exceeds 96.5 by weight on dry basis , the layers themselves which are composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica are excessively destroyed, and it is impossible to reconstruct the layered crystalline structures composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica as will be later described, even by the treatment with a magnesium and or an aluminum compound according to the second step. Hence the resulting clay mineral has markedly inferior color developing ability to the color developer 1 in the present invention. It is essential, therefore, that the acid treatment of the first step should be performed to such an extent that the SiO2 content of the acid treated clay mineral should not exceed 96.5 by weight. When the acid treatment is continued until theSiO2 content of the untreated clay mineral exceeds 95 by weight on dry basis , the treating conditions become rigorous, and many treating hours are required. In addition to such economical disadvantages, the resulting product does not necessarily exhibit improved color developing ability, and some types of clay minerals even show a reduced color developing ability. Accordingly, the acid treatment is carried out preferably to such an extent that the SiO2 content of the acid treated clay mineral becomes 85 to 95 by weight, in order to secure economic advantages and to protect the layer composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica from excessive destruction. The electron diffraction patterns in Figures 1 to 4 of U. S. Patent No. 4,405,371 European Laid OpenPatent Publication No. 0044645A1 which describes the rearch work of the present inventors on the color developer 1 give the following information. For example, the dioctahedral montmorillonite clay mineral occurring in Arizona U. S. A. shows a characteristic diffraction pattern attributable to the layered crystalline structure Fig. 1 . When it is intensely acid treated SiO2 content, about 94 by weight , the diffraction pattern attributable to the crystals substantially disappears in electron diffractometry Fig. 2 . When the acid treated clay mineral is treated, for example, with an aqueous magnesium chloride or aluminum chloride solution according to the second step, neutralized with an aqueous caustic soda solution, washed with water and dried, the product again shows diffraction pattern characteristic of the layered crystalline structure when examined by electron diffractometory, as shown inFigs. 3 and 4.This fact is believed to show that although the crystals having the layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica are destroyed by the acid treatment of the first step, the layers themselves remain without complete destructions and that the remaining layers composed of regular tetrahedrous of silica are re contructed into crystals by the magnesium and or aluminum component. An analysis of the electron diffraction pattern of the re constructed crystals shows that the spacing of the crystals re constructed by the magnesium component very closely resembles that of the starting montmorillonite clay mineral, but that of the crystals re constructed by the aluminum component is narrower than that of the starting montmorillonite clay minerals. These facts seem to suggest that the reconstructed crystals, particularly those reconstructed by the aluminurn component, differ from the crystals of the starting clay mineral. Nevertheless, the color developer 1 used in this invention which shows the diffraction pattern of the crystals reconstructed by a magnesium or an aluminum component in electron diffractometry the product of the second step exhibits an improved color developing ability particularly with respect to a primary color forming dye over the acid treated product, and also shows an improved colordeveloping ability with respect to a secondary colorforming dye.Furthermore, the color developer 1 scarcely decreases in color developing ability after storage in an atmosphere kept at a high humidity and a high temperature, and evidently, a marked improvement in color developing ability is noted. Further investigations of the present inventors showed that when a color formed by the color developer 1 is exposed to sunlight, particularly to ultraviolet light, the color tends to fade and or discolor. In an attempt to improve the light resistance of the color developer 1 , the present inventors made various investigations, and finally found that a color formed by the color developer 1 can be markedly protected from fading and discoloration by incorporating a small amount of at least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of the oxides and hydroxides of calcium, magnesium and zinc in the color developer 1 . The suitable amount of the metal compound to be incorporated in the color developer 1 is 0.2 to 2 millimoles, preferably 0.4 to 1 millimole, per gram of the color developer 1 and the metal compound combined. The hydroxide of calcium, the oxide or hydroxide of magnesium and the oxide of zinc are preferred as the metal compound, and calcium hydroxide is especially preferred. These metal oxides or hydroxides can be used either singly or in combination with each other. When two or more of these metal compounds are used together, a a combination of calcium hydroxide and magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide , b a combination of calcium hydroxide and zinc oxide, and c a combination of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium oxide and zinc oxide, especially the combinations a and b , are preferred. Advantageously, in these combinations, the mole ratio of calcium hydroxide to magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and or zinc oxide is adjusted to from 0.9 0.1 to 0.2 0.8. By using the metal compounds in combination as described above, the light resistance of a color formed by the color developer 1 or a mixture of the color developer 1 and the color developer 2 can be further increased. Preferably, the metal compound and the color developer 1 are mixed as uniformly as possible to obtain the composition of this invention. For this purpose, the metal compound preferably has such a particle size that when its particle size is measured by the Andreasen pipette, the proportion of particles having a particle diameter of not more than 10 microns is at least 70 by weight. It is particularly advantageous that the metal compound contains at least 90 by weight of particles which have a size 325 mesh under according to the Tyler s mesh. The color developer 1 can be used as a mixture with an acid treated dioctahedral montmorillonite clay mineral or a mixture of it with a naturally occurring dioctahedral montmorillonite clay mineral tto be referred to as the color developer 2 which minerals have heretofore been known as color developers for pressure sensitive recording sheets. As described in the specification of U. S. Patent No. 4,405,371 European Laid Open Patent Publication No. 0044645A1 cited above, a mixture of the color developer 1 and the color developer 2 with the proportion of the color developer 1 being at least 3 by weight based on the mixture, when formed into an aqueous composition for coating on a receiving sheet, has a much lower viscosity than that of an aqueous composition of the color developer 2 alone.Accordingly, the aqueous composition in a high concentration can be coated on the receiving sheet, and the coating operation and drying become easy. When a mixture of at least 10 by weight, especially at least 20 by weight, of the color developer 1 , and the color developer 2 is used as a color developer for pressure sensitive recording sheets, the presence of the color developer 1 increases the color developing ability of the mixture and its aqueous composition decreases in viscosity. Hence, this color developer is very useful in practical applications.Even when such a color developer mixture is used, the inclusion of the aforesaid metal compound makes it possible to prevent effectively a color formed by the color developer mixture from fading or discoloration. Accordingly, in the present invention, the metal compound specified above can be incorporated also in the mixture of the color developer 1 and the color developer 2 in the same way as described above with regard to the color developer 1 . The color developer 2 will be described below in detail. Color developer 2 The color developer 2 used in this invention may be any of conventional known color developers for pressure sensitive recording sheets which are composed of acid treated products of dioctahedral montmorillonite clay minerals such as acid clay and sub bentonite, or mixtures thereof with naturally occurring dioctahedral montmorillonite clay minerals. The acid treated products of the montmorillonite clay minerals especially an active clay obtained by acid treatment of acid clay, are preferred. The acid treatment for production of these is carried out under such conditions that the treated product does not lose the diffraction pattern attributed to the crystals of a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica, which the starting clay has. The acid treatment under the relatively mild conditions described above increases the specific surface area of the starting clay mineral, The color developer 2 used in this invention preferably has a specific surface area of at least 180 m2 g. A typical method for producing the color developer 2 is described in the specification ofU. S. Patent No. 3,622,364. Preferably, when a secondary color is formed by the reaction of the color developer 2 with benzoyl leuco methylene blue described in the above cited patent specification, the color developer 2 has a secondary color developing performance K2, defined by the following equation, of at least 1.40. K R430 2 1 1 R R550 where R430 and R550 are the reflectances of light having a wavelength of 430 me and 550 me respectively. The color developer composition of this invention comprises the color developer 1 or a mixture of the color developer 1 and the color developer 2 and 0.2 to 2 millimoles, preferably 0.4 to 1 millimole, of the aforesaid metal compound per gram of the color developer or developers and the metal compound combined. Preferably, the composition is prepared by blending in the dry state the metal compound with a dried product of the color developer 1 or a mixture of it with the color developer 2 . When the color developer 2 is used together, it is possible to blend the color developer 2 with the metal compound and then adding the color developer 1 to the mixture.Alternatively, the metal compound is blended with the color developer 1 and then a suitable amount of the color developer 2 is added to the mixture. Blending can be effected by any known method. Preferably, the color developer composition of this invention comprising the color developer 1 and the metal compound, or the color developer 1 , the color developer 2 and the metal compound has such a particle size that at least 99 by weight thereof consists of particles having a size 325 mesh under in accordance with the Tyler s mesh. When the color developer composition of this invention is dipped in a 1M aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and maintained at ordinary temperature for example, 250C for a suitable period of time for example, 24 hours preferably with occasional shaking, the metal compound blended with the color developer 1 or the mixture of the color developers 1 and 2 dissolves in the aqueous ammonium chloride solution.Hence, the amount of the metal compound in the color developer composition can be determined by this method for details, see the testing method described hereinafter . The color developer 1 used in this invention is obtained by intensely acid treating a clay mineral of a layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica preferably such that the treated product does not substantially show the diffraction pattern attributed to the crystals of layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica which the clay mineral before the acid treatment has , and contacting the treated product with at least partially soluble magnesium and or aluminum compound to reconstruct the crystals of the layer structure so that they show a diffraction pattern attributed to the layer structure composed of regular tetrahedrons of silica in electron diffractometry.The magnesium and or aluminum consumed in the reconstruction of these crystals is not dissolved out by the aforesaid treatment with the aqueous ammonium chloride solution, but is still retained in the color developer 1 . But that portion of the magnesium compound used in the reconstruction which remains free in the color developer 1 in a very small amount dissolves in the aqueous ammonium chloride solution as does the metal compound blended in the color developer 1 . That portion of the magnesium compcund used in the reconstruction which remains free in the color developer 1 and dissolves in the aqueous ammonium chloride solution is usually very small in amount, and insufficient to improve the light resistance of a color formed by the color developer 1 . But when combined with the metal compound included in the color developer 1 , it serves to increase the light resistance. Accordingly, in the present invention, all compounds which are dissolved out from the color developer composition of this invention by treatment with an aqueous ammonium chloride solution and correspond to the aforesaid metal compounds will be dealt with as the metal compounds in accordance with this invention. The clay minerals used as raw materials for the production of the color developers 1 and 2 contain calcium or magnesium, but calcium and magnesium are not dissolved out by treatment with the aqueous ammonium chloride solution. In preparing an aqueous composition from the color developer composition for coating on a receiving sheet, the concentration of the color developer composition can be adjusted to about 20 to about 50 by weight. A suitable amount of a water soluble or waterdispersible binder can be added to the aqueous coating composition. Examples of the water soluble binder are starch, carboxy methyl cellulose CMC , polyvinyl alcohol PVA , casein and gelatin. Starch and carboxymethyl cellulose are preferably used. Examples of the water dispersible binder are a styrenebutadiene type latex, an acrylic latex, a vinyl acetate type emulsion and vinyl chloride type emulsion.The styrene butadiene type latex is preferred. The combined use of thewater soluble binder and the water dispersible binder is especially preferred. The amount of the binder used, as solids content, is 10 to 30 by weight, preferably 13 to 20 by weight, based on the solids content of the aqueous coating composition. The aqueous coating composition may further contain at least one of pH adjusting agents, dispersing agents and viscosity adjusting agents. The pH adjusting agents may include the hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and lithium carbonate sodium silicate and ammonia. Examples of the dispersing agents include polyphosphates such as sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium pyrophosphate, and polycarboxylic acid salts such as sodium polycarboxylate and ammonium polycarboxylate. As the viscosity adjusting agents, talc, mica and asbestos Japanese Patent Publication No. 23177 1970 , and kaolin, and calcium carbonate Japanese Patent Publication No. 4799 1980 may be used. As required, an extender or a color developer other than the color developers 1 and 2 may further be included in the aqueous coating composition in accordance with this invention. The color developer compositions of this invention have a great color developing ability with respect to primary color forming dyes and secondary color forming dyes, and their color developing ability shows only a very low degree of reduction after storage at high temperatures and humidities. The following Examples and ComparativeExamples illustrate the present invention more specifically. The various tests used in these examples are described below. 1. Determination of the quantity of the metal compound About 0.5 g of a color developer sample was put in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a ground stopper and precisely weighed beforehand, and dried at 1100C for 3 hours. The flask was then again weighed precisely, and the weight W g of the sample was determined. Then1 50 ml of a 1M aqueous ammonium chloride solution prepared by using ammonium chloride of special reagent grade was added by a whole pipette. The flask was put in a constant temperature vessel equipped with a shaking machine and kept at 250C, and gently shaken for 24 hours. The contents of the flask were separated by a centrifugal separator. The supernatant liquid separated was taken in an amount of 5 ml into a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask by a whole pipette. A very small amount of aluminum, etc. was masked with triethanolamine, and the pH of the liquid was adjusted by NH3 NH4C1 buffer solution to about 10. The liquid was then titrated with a 1 100 M standard solu tion of EDTA using Eriochrome Black T BT as an indicator. The titrated amount V ml to the total amount of calcium, magnesium and zinc was determined. The amount mmoles g of the metal compound which dissolved at this time from the color developer sample into the 1M NH4C1 solution can be calculated from the following equation. Total amount of dissolved metals f.V lOW where f represents the titer of the 1 100 mole standard solution of EDTA. 2. Measurement of the particle diameter 1 Content of particles having a particle diameter of not more than 10 microns by the Andreasen pipette method Six grams after drying at 1100C of a color developer sample was taken into a l liter narrowmouthed bottle, and 600 ml of water was added. Then,O.8 g of sodium pyrophosphate of first class reagent grade was added, and the bottle was sealed up. The bottle was shaken for 60 minutes by a shaking machine at 140 reciprocations per minute amplitude 8 cm to disperse the sample. The dispersion was then transferred to anAndreason pipette JIS Z 890l, DIN 51033 and the pipette was manipulated in accordance with the pipette operating method. Immediately, a suspension as a blank was collected, and after drying at 110 C, its weight was measured S g .Then, after a certain period of time, a suspension containing particles having a particle diameter of not more than 10 microns calculated by the Stokes equation was collected by the pipette. It was dried at 1100C, and its weight W g was precisely measured. The content of particles having a particle diameter of not more than 10 microns is calculated from the following equation. Content of particles having w having a particle diameter of x 100 not more than 10 microns S where S is the weight of the blank and W is the weight of particles having a particle diameter of not more than 10 microns 2 Content of particles having a size 325 mesh under Fifty grams of a color developer sample after drying at 1100C was taken into a 500 ml beaker. Water was added and the sample was well dispersed by a glass rod. The dispersion was gently poured little by little onto a 325 mesh sieve, and passed therethrough fully together with flowing water. All the material left on the sieve was put in a 100 ml beaker using a washing bottle, and dried. The weight M g of the solid obtained after drying at 1100C was measured, and the content of particles having a size 325 mesh under was calculated from the following equation. Content of particles having a size 325 M x 100 mesh under 50 3. Method of testing color developing ability and method of measuring the viscosity of the coating composition 1 Preparation of a coating composition One gram of sodium hexametaphosphate was dissolved in 175 g of water, and 100 g after drying at 1100C of a color developer sample was added. A 20 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the pH of the solution to about 9.5 when the pH of the solution before addition of sodium hydroxide exceeds 9.5, the addition of sodium hydroxide is unnecessary .Then, 15 g of a 20 aqueous solution of starch and 34 g of SBR latex DoW 620, solids concentration 50 were added, and the pH of the solution was again adjusted to 9.5 with a 20 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.Water was further added to adjust the total amount of the slurry to 400 g. It was fully agitated by an agitator to form a uniform dispersion. 2 Color developing ability test Preparation of receiving sheets The resulting coating slurry was coated on 8 sheets of paper 4 sheets coated at a high rate and 4 sheets coated at a low rate by means of two coating rods wire diameter 0.10 mm and 0.05 mm, respectively .The coated papers were dried in the air and then dried at 11OOC for 3 minutes. The amount of the coating solution applied was measured determined from the dry weight difference between a sample of the uncoated paper and a sample of a uniformly coated portion of the coated paper, both samples having the same area . The coated sheets of paper were cut into halves to form two 4 sheet sets having the same coating amount . The amounts of coating of the two types were slightly more and slightly less than 6 g m2. Initial color developing ability test One of the two 4 sheet sets of receiving sheets was put in a desiccator relative humidity 75 containing a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and stored in the dark at 250C. After the lapse of about 24 hours from the coating, it was taken out and exposed indoors kept constantly at about 25 0C and a relative humidity of about 60 for 16 hours, and then subjected to color development. Color development was carried out by the following procedure.The receiving sheets were superposed on two different types of transfer sheets, either 1 a transfer sheet coated with microcapsules containing CVL Crystal Violet Lactone which is an instantaneously color forming leuco dye CVL dye sheet or 2 a commercial transfer sheet coated with microcapsules containing a mixture of CVL, BLMB Benzoyl LeucoMethylene Blue and a fluoran type dye mixed dye sheet , with their coated surfaces facing each other, and together inserted between a pair of steel rolls, and revolving the rolls under pressure to rupture the microcapsules completely. The color developing ability of each of the receiving sheets was evaluated by measuring the density of the color one hour after color formation by means of a densitometer Fuji Densitometer Model P, made by FujiShashin Film K.K. , and averaging the measured values on four sheets. High densities show high color developing ability. The color developing ability of a sample color developer density A is expressed by the density tat on the receiving sheet coated with 6 g m2 of the color developer calculated from the density awl of the thinly coated al g m2 receiving sheet and the density A of the thickly coated a2 g m2 receiving sheet. In the calculation, because the density and coating amount are in substantially linear relationship direct proportion with the receiving sheets coated with an identical sample in the amounts around 6 g m2, the density A can be determined from the equation below. Initial color developing ability A A1 A2 A1 6 a1 a2 a1 Light resistance test The color developed sheet used in the initial color developing ability test was irradiated with an artificial light carbon arc lamp for two hours, as set in a weatherometer Suga Shikenki K.K., StandardSunshine Weatherometer, WE SUN HC model . The density of the developed color which faded upon the irradiation was measured. The density B of the developed color on the receiving sheet coated with 6 g m2 of sample color developer, after fading, was calculated from the similar densities of thinly coated and thickly coated receiving sheets B and B2 , respectively as in the foregoing.The light resistance is expressed by the ratio of B to the initial color developing density A , i.e., B A . B B1 B2 B1 6 a1 a2 a1 Light resistance B A 3 Measurement of the viscosity of the coating solution Two hundred grams of the coating solution obtained in 1 above was transferred to a 300 rnl beaker equipped with an agitator having four perpendicularly crossing blades, 20 mm x 20 mm , and agitated at a speed of 500 rpm in a constant temperature water vessel at 250C for 15 minutes. The viscosity of the solution, two minutes after starting of rotation at 60 rpm,was measured by a B type rotary viscometer.Comparative Example la Montmorillonite clay occurring in Arizona,U. S. A. was crushed by agitating it together with water to form a 20 slurry. To 500 g of the slurry was added 150 g of 97 sulfuric acid, and further 50 g of water was added. The mixture was heated for 10 hours in a water bath at 95 C. During this time, the slurry was agitated every 30 minutes to promote the reaction.After the heating, the treated slurry was suctionfiltered, and again water and 150 g of 97 sulfuric acid were added to adjust the total amount of the slurry to 700 g. It was then acid treated at 95 0C for 10 hours.The treated product was washed with water by filtration, and the cake was put in a pot mill. Water was added, and pulverized in the wet state together with Korean chart pebbles to obtain a 15 slurry. First step 429 g SiO2 content 60 g of the resulting slurry Si02 content of the dry solid 93.30 was heated to 800C, and with stirring, 500 ml of a 1M aqueous solution of magnesium chloride was added dropwise over the course of about 30 minutes. The mixture was aged for 30 minutes. Then, a 10 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added dropwise over the course of about 30 minutes to perform neutralization. The mixture was aged for 30 minutes to complete the reaction.The reaction mixture was washed with water by filtration, and the filtration cake was dried at 1lO0C.

The mixture was heated on a water bath at 950C tor 10 hours. During this time, the slurry was agitated every 30 minutes to promote the reaction. After the heating, the reaction mixture was suction filtered, and water and 250 g of 97 sulfuric acid were again added to adjust the total amount of the mixture to 700 g. It was acid treated at 950C for 10 hours. The treated product was washed with water by filtration, and the filtration cake was put in a pot mill.Water was added, and the entire mixture was pulverized in the wet state together with Korean chart pebbles to obtain a 15 slurry. First step 455 g SiO2 content 60g of the resulting slurry SiO2 content of the dry solid 87.91 was heated to 80 C, and with stirring, 500 ml of a 1M aqueous solution of aluminum chloride was added dropwise over the course of about 30 minutes.
