# DOUBLE ELECTRIC LAYER CAPACITOR.

## Abstract
A double electric layer capacitor utilizes double electric layers formed at the boundaries between polarized elec trodes and an electrolyte. The polarized electrodes 17 are of carbon or activated carbon fiber, and conductive electrodes 18 are formed as current collectors on the electrode 17 of carbon or activated carbon fiber, thereby forming an elec trode unit.
