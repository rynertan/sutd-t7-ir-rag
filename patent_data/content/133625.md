# Scroll type compressor with lubricating system.

## Abstract
A lubricating system for a scroll type compressor is described. The compressor unit includes a housing 10 having a front end plate 11 and a cup shaped casing 12 . A fluid inlet port 35 is formed on the cup shaped casing 12 and has a step portion 351a radially projecting from an inner surface thereof. A first oil passageway 38 is formed through the cup shaped casing 12 with one end opening at the inner wall of the inlet port 35 adjacent to the step portion 351 . A second oil passageway 39 is formed through the front end plate 11 and connects with the first oil passageway 38 . One end of the second oil passageway 39 opens to a shaft seal cavity formed on the front end plate 11 . Therefore, the shaft seal cavity is connected with the fluid inlet port 35 by the first and second oil passage ways 38 , 39 , and the shaft assembly is lubricated and cooled by lubricating oil and suction gas flowing through the oil passageway. Further passageways convey lubricant from the shaft seal cavity to the bearing elements of the compress or and finally to the suction chamber 31 of the compressor.
