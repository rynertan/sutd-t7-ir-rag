# Startup procedure for reforming catalysts.

## Abstract
Process for reforming a hydrocarbon charge under reforming conditions in a reforming zone containing a sulfur sensitive metal containing reforming catalyst wherein over cracking of the charge stock and excessive temperature rise in the reforming zone is suppressed by pre conditioning the catalyst prior to contact with the charge with a reformate having an octave number R O of from 90 to 100 and an aromatics content of from 40 to 50 mole percent.
