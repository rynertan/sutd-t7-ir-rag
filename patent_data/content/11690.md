# Improved amusement device.

## Abstract
An amusement device for use by children both for enter tainment as well as a coordination aid. The device comprises a plurality of thin essentially similar segments 10 , each seg ment pivotally engaging adjacent segments in snap in rela tion 12 . The pivotal engagement enables rotation of one segment 10 with respect to an adjacently engaged segment 10 through a predetermined angle. Locking means are formed into the segments 10 , preventing translation of one segment 10 with respect to another when such segments 10 are engaged. When connected in the form of an open belt, the device may be manipulated in various entertaining man ners, and upon articulation, the impact of adjacent segments 10 produces a slapping sound for additional amusement. When the free ends of the belt arrangement are engaged to form a closed loop, two segment stacks 16, 18 are created. Back and forth manipulation of each segment stack causes individual segments 10 to move from one stack 16,. 18 to the other. Additionally, by providing indicia such as pictures, performations, and patterns on each segment face, a chang ing visual display is obtained as the segments 10 are articu lated from one stack 16, 18 to the other.
