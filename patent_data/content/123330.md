# CIRCUITAL ARRANGEMENT FOR COUNTING AND DIVIDING THE TAXATION IMPULSES PERTAINING TO A GENERICAL TELEPHONE LINE

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a circuital arrangement adapted to divide the charges pertaining to a telephone line among the users of the terminal s connected to the line itself. An identification code number is given to each user. At the engagement of the telephone line the circuital arrangement connects, in parallel with terminal TL an inhibiting CI adapted to prevent the switching exchange CT from detect ing the dialled digits. These are however detected by a logic unit UL and if they coincide with one of the allowed code numbers, the inhibiting circuit CI is excluded, thus allowing the exchange CI to detect the next selection. Possible taxa tion impulses, generated by the switching exchange CT are summed in a memory element associated with the dialled code number.
