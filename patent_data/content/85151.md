# Timing system.

## Abstract
A central clock 5 generates a plurality of odd and even clock pulses which are distributed to a plurality of logic and circuit modules 3 by clock signal lines 7 of equal length. The central clock 5 also generates a plurality of gate pulses which are supplied to the modules 3 on signal lines 9 which can be different in length from one to another. The gate pulses are wide enough to coincide with the clock pulses with appropriate allowance for skew between the pulses. For each pair of pulses delivered to a module 3 , a detection circuit is provided which detects if the gate pulse and the clock pulse begin and end in the proper sequence. If an improper sequence occurs, the information is stored in a scannable latch and a machine stop control may be gener ated. The failing module 3 can be traced readily.
