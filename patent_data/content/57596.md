# Apparatus for measuring melting point and boiling point of a sample.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring the melting point and the boiling point of sample gas to obtain the purity and the mixture ratio of mixed gases in which gaseous phase gas is cooled, even if a heat medium is cooled when the gas transforms from the gaseous state to liquid state, the gas maintains a constant temperature state due to latent heat. Thus, the melting point and the boiling point of the gas can be precisely measured with a simple inexpensive construc tion.
