## Description
The present invention generally relates to a magnetic disk cartridge for storing image data, audio data, text data and the like according to the preamble of claim 1. In detail, the invention relates to a magnetic disk cartridge of the type which comprises a cassette having a cover and a recording medium mounted therein, said cassette being structurally adapted to cooperate with a data recording and reproducing apparatus for recording data upon said recording medium and reproducing data recorded upon said recording medium, said cassette and said apparatus further cooperating to permit data to be recorded on said recording medium when said cassette is in a write enable state and inhibiting recording of data on said recording medium when said cassette is in a write inhibit state. Various kinds of magnetic disk cartridges are used to record image data, audio data, text data and other signals. One type of magnetic tape cartridge is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,466,032, issued on August 14, 1984, to Saito, which is assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. This prior art disk cartridge encloses a flexible magnetic disk within a thin box shaped cartridge. The cartridge defines an opening through which a magnetic head of a disk drive of a recording and reproducing apparatus has access to the disk surface for recording video, audio, text, digital data, and other signals and reproducing the recorded data. As will be appreciated, when the recorded data are important and must not be inadvertently or erroneously erased, no additional data should be written or recorded onto the disk. One typical method of erasure prevention in the known art involves a recess or opening at an appropriate point on the cartridge. The recess or opening in the cartridge receives a write preventing lever or pin which prevents a write head in the recording apparatus from contacting the disk while the lever or pin is within the recess or opening. In early disk cartridges, the recess or opening was sealed by a strip forming part of the cartridge, which strip was broken and removed after important data were recorded. Once the recess or opening covering strip was removed from the cartridge, the strip could not be re installed on the cartridge to enable that cartridge to receive additional recorded data. Therefore, conventional magnetic disk cartridges have their recesses or openings sealed by adhesive tape or other appropriate means. In order to make such disk cartridges more convenient to use, a novel magnetic disk cartridge was proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4,460,930, issued on July 17, 1984 to Takahashi, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In the proposed arrangement, the magnetic disk cartridge is provided with an erasure preventing movable piece which can slide between a closing position at which the aforementioned recess or opening is covered and an opening position at which the recess or opening is uncovered to allow entry of a write preventing lever or pin as set forth above. This movable piece in the proposed arrangement is not removed from the cartridge, and therefore allows a repeated change of state of the magnetic disk cartridge between a write enabled state and a write inhibited state. In this cartridge, further writing on the disk is enabled when the movable piece is in its recess closing position. On the other hand, further writing is inhibited when the movable piece is in its recess opening position. Although the aforementioned cartridge advantageously allows a repeated change of writing receiving state of the magnetic cartridge without requiring other means for covering the recess or opening after once being actuated to the write inhibited state, the presence of the movable piece causes the structure of the cartridge to become complicated and tends to lower the yield and the production rate of the magnetic disk cartridge during manufacture. Especially, in the structure of the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,460,930, the erasure preventing piece must be firmly maintained between the upper and lower halves of the cartridge during assembly. This secure position requires a special and rather expensive tool to hold the erasure preventing piece in place within the cartridge during assembly. In addition, since the erasure preventing movable piece must be held securely in either the erasure preventing position or the erasure enabling position, a detecting mechanism or the like is required. An example of a detecting mechanism is referred to in the 930 patent noted above. Since a detecting mechanism makes the movable piece rather bulky, the erasure preventing piece cannot be conveniently used in a relatively small magnetic disk cartridge. GB A 2 067 000 discloses an information signal recording and or reproducing apparatus which receives a jacket as reflected in the preamble of claim 1, which is provided with a slider for preventing inadvertent erasure. The slider is slidably supported by a pair of sliding ribs formed on the lower wall of the jacket. An operating portion in zig zag or knurled form provided on the slider is exposed from the jacket through openings of the upper and lower walls to operate the slider from the outside. The slider is also provided with a resilient piece with a projection at the end portion thereof spaced from a slit. One of the ribs is provided with grooves capable of communicating with the projection, whereby the projection may be engaged selectively with either of the grooves upon the sliding operation of the slider. A not shown mechanism in the body of the apparatus may be operated, for example, to prevent inadvertent erasure or to change over trackings, in association with the operation of the slider and according to the position of the slider. In place of the slider having the zig zag operation portion, a slider having a circular hole may be provided so as to be operated from the outside. Thus, it remained a problem in the cassette recording and reproducing art to provide a relatively small disk cartridge structure which effectively incorporated a movable erasure preventing mechanism. Therefore, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a magnetic disk cartridge with an erasure preventing device which allows data to be written onto a magnetic disk while the device is in one position and which inhibits data writing onto the disk while in another position and which can be easily attached to the magnetic disk cartridge. In order to accomplish the aforementioned and other objects such a magnetic disk cartridge is characterised as expressed in claim 1. Other aspects of the invention are contained in the claims 2 to 18. The present invention will be understood more fully from the detailed description given herebelow and from the accompanying drawings of the preferred embodiment of the invention, which, however, should not be taken to limit the invention to the specific embodiment, but are for explanation and understanding only. In the drawings Referring now to the drawings, particularly to Figs. 1 and 2, the preferred embodiment of a magnetic disk cartridge according to the present invention will be described herebelow in terms of a magnetic disk cartridge specifically designed for video recording. Although the specific structure of the magnetic tape cartridge will be described in detail in order to facilitate a better understanding of the invention, it should be noted that the present invention is applicable not only to the shown magnetic disk cartridge structure but also to other types of magnetic disk cartridges. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the preferred embodiment of the magnetic disk cartridge or cassette 1 generally comprises a cartridge casing 2 preferably made of synthetic resin assembled into the shape of a thin box, as best seen in Fig. 2. The cartridge casing 2 preferably consists of separate upper and lower casings or cassette halves 4 and 5 which are assembled into a shape resembling a thin box by ultra sonic welding or another appropriate fixing process. The upper and lower casings 4 and 5 when assembled into the cartridge casing 2 define an internal space which structurally accommodates a rotatable magnetic disk 3 serving as a recording medium. When such a cassette casing 2 is inserted into a mating opening of a suitable recording and reproducing apparatus having a data writing head, the cassette is structurally and functionally able to receive signals for recording data on the magnetic disk and for reproducing signals previously recorded on the disk. Such mechanisms for thus cooperating are well known in the art. The upper casing 4 has a generally planar, rectangular shape. On the other hand, the lower casing 5 further includes a plurality of side walls 6 extending upwardly from the peripheral edges of the major plane section 5a of the upper casing 4. The lower edge of each side wall is preferably integrally formed with the plane section 5a. The upper edge of each side wall 6 is designed to mate with the peripheral edge of the upper casing 4 and is fixed thereto to form the cartridge shown in its assembled form in Fig. 2. The upper casing 4 and the major plane section 5a of the lower casing 5 each define respective central openings 7 and 8 which are aligned when the upper and lower casings 4 and 5 are assembled together. The central openings 7 and 8 accommodate an essentially cylindrical center core 19 of the magnetic disk 3. The center core 19 of the magnetic disk 3 has a drive hole 20 which engages a drive shaft not shown of a disk drive not shown of the recording and reproducing apparatus for rotation of the magnetic disk 3 upon command within the cartridge casing 2. An essentially annular but interrupted projection 9 concentric with the center opening 8 projects upwardly from the major plane section 5a of the lower casing 5. Preferably, the projection 9 is also integrally formed with the major plane section 5a of the disk. The upper edge of the annular projection 9 is designed to contact or to mate with the lower surface of the upper casing 4 to define a generally cylindrical disk receptacle 9a within the cartridge casing 2. The center axis of the center openings 7 and 8 and the center axis of the annular projection 9 are aligned, and offset from the geometrical center of the cartridge casing 2 so that the outer periphery of the annular projection 9 is connected to the inner periphery of one section 6a of the side wall 6. The lower surface of the upper casing 4 defines at least two pairs of inwardly extending projections 10a, 10b which are respectively located symmetrically about the center axis of the central opening 7 of the upper cassette half 4. The annular projection 9 defines mating recesses 11a and 11b located oppositely to the projections 10a and 10b. When the two cartridge halves 4 and 5 are assembled, the recesses 11a and 11b securely receive the projections 10a and 10b, respectively, to position properly the upper casing 4 with respect to the lower casing 5. Windows 12 and 13 are formed in the upper and lower casings 4 and 5 at mutually axially aligned opposing positions. As will be appreciated from the side of the cartridge 2 which is diametrically opposite the section 6a of the side wall 6. The windows 12 and 13 expose a part of the surface of the magnetic disk 3 to the outside of the cartridge 2. A magnetic head not shown contained within into the disk drive can thus enter the cartridge casing 2 to write video data for recording on the magnetic disk 3 and to read the recorded video data from the disk 3 for reproduction. The windows 12 and 13 are opened and closed selectively by a shutter 14 which includes a spaced pair of window closing plates structurally arranged to be laterally slidable to and fro on the surfaces of the cartridge to cover and uncover the windows respectively. The shutter 14, when in a closed position, covers the windows 12 and 13 while the cartridge is not in use. The shutter 14 is automatically moved to its open position at which it uncovers the windows 12, 13, upon insertion into a recording apparatus, such as an electronic camera and the like, and or into a disk player serving as a reproducing apparatus. While the shutter 14 is in its open position and the windows 12 and 13 are uncovered, the magnetic head of the disk drive can enter into the cartridge casing and contact the magnetic disk 3 for recording and reproduction. The mechanism for actuating the shutter 14 between its closed position and open position is a well known technique disclosed in this art. The magnetic disk cartridge may be provided with an indicator member 17 for indicating the number of annular tracks in which data have been recorded. This indicator member has been disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,511,944, issued on April 16, 1985, to Saito, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Also, a similar indicator means has been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,466,302, mentioned above. The disclosures concerning the indicator means in the aforementioned United States patents are hereby incorporated by reference for the sake of completeness of this disclosure. The magnetic disk cartridge 1 is also provided with a status indicator mechanism which is generally represented by the reference numeral 21. In summary, the status indicator mechanism 21 indicates whether or not the magnetic disk cartridge is able to receive additional data for storage on the disk 3. A potential difficulty is that whenever data are written onto the disks, the newly written data over writes the previously recorded data and thus erases whatever data, if any, had been previously recorded. Therefore, when the recorded data are not to be erased even in error, the magnetic disk cartridge 1 must be placed in a condition wherein the writing of new data is inhibited. The state of the magnetic disk cartridge in which data recording is prevented will be hereafter referred to as a write inhibited state . On the other hand, the state of the magnetic disk cartridge wherein writing of data is allowed will be referred to hereafter as a write enabled state . Therefore, the status indicator mechanism 21 is actuable between the write inhibited state and write enabled state. The Status indicator mechanism includes a laterally slidable slider member 35. The slider member 35 acts to change the status of the status indicator mechanism 21 by moving between at least two defined positions. The slider member 35 is free to move between a write inhibited position, which position will be hereafter referred to as an inhibiting position and a write enabled position, which position will be hereafter referred to as an enabling position . The lower casing 5 further defines a rectangular opening 22 best seen in Figs. 3 5 which is integrally formed with an opening 23 extending through the portion 6a of the side wall 6 which defines an interruption in the continuity of the side wall 6a. The opening 22 is transversely offset from the center axis of the cartridge which extends through the center axis of the openings 7 and 8 of the upper and lower casings 4 and 5. The major portion of the opening 22 is located between the outer periphery of the annular projection 9 and the inner periphery of the side wall portion 6a of the cassette half 5. The opening 23 receives the slider 35 upon assembly and allows the slider to enter the opening 22 as shown in either Figs. 1 or 3. The slider 35 is thus added to the lower casing 5 from outside the cartridge after the cartridge is assembled. The slider 35 is made from a suitable synthetic resin and is generally channel shaped with an upper horizontal leg portion 35b, a lower horizontal leg portion 35a and an intermediate vertical connecting portion 35c extending between the upper and lower horizontal leg portions 35b and 35a at one end thereof, to define a generally U shaped section. At least the upper horizontal leg portion 35b of the slider 35 is elastically deformable. As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the upper horizontal leg portion 35b has a projection 37 extending downwardly from the lower surface at a location remote from the connection portion 35c. The upper horizontal portion 35b also includes an extension 36 extending upwardly from its outer peripheral edge in the region adjacent the connecting portion 35c. The inner peripheral edge of the upper horizontal leg portion 35b is tapered toward its free end. The lateral thickness of the vertical connecting portion 35c matches or is slightly less than the lateral width of the opening 23 so that the slider 35 is able to pass through the opening 23 when the slider 35 is assembled to the lower casing 5. A vertically extending rib 24 extends along the peripheral edge of the opening 22. The rib 24 is generally L shaped and is connected to the annular projection 9 at its one end and to the section 6a of the side wall 6 at its other end. The section 6a of the side wall 6 has a lower portion 25 which defines a cut out 25a in its upper edge. A click plate 26 is integrally formed with the section 25 and extends frontwardly. The lower cassette half 5 also defines a linearly shaped click rib 27 extending between the side wall 6a and the projection 9 and having bevelled edges 27a and 27b. The click rib 27 is also integral to the portion 25 and lies parallel to the click plate 26. The front end of each of the click plate 26 and the click rib 27 adjoin the outer periphery of the annular projection 9. In the preferred construction, the inclination of the bevelled edges 27a and 27b is selected to be 45 . The click rib 27 as structured engages the downward projection 37 of the slider 35 in order to serve as a click stop for the slider 35. The upper edges of the rib 27 and the click plate 26 lie flush with the upper horizontal plane of the cut out 25. Therefore, this structure leaves space for the upper horizontal section 35b of the slider 35. As shown in Figs. 1 and 4, the upper casing 4 has a strip 30 projecting slightly downwardly from the edge of the upper casing 4, as well as a projection 31 which is deeper but narrower than the strip 30. The strip 30 and the projection 31 generally oppose the opening 22 and the cut out 25 respectively. The dimensions of these parts 30, 31 match those of the spaces 23 and 25 so as to mate with the latter when the upper and lower casings are assembled and to fill these spaces. In practice, the outer periphery of the elements 30 and 31 lie flush with the outer periphery of the side wall 6. As best shown in Fig. 5, the upper casing 4 also defines a rectangular recess 32 which overlies the click plate structure. A window 34 opening to the upper surface of the upper casing 4 extends through the upper casing 4. The upper edge of the vertical extension 36 of the slider 35 thus opposes the window 34 so as to be visible from outside the cartridge 1. The window 34 is contiguous with a groove 33 extending along the strip 30, as shown in Fig. 5. The recess 32 in conjunction with the periphery 24 of the rectangular opening 22 and the click plate 26 thus defines a space for receiving the upper horizontal portion 35b of the slider and allows resilient deformation of the section 35b as the slider moves laterally with respect to the wall 6a. As will be clear from Fig. 4, an essentially rectangular recess 28 is defined on the lower surface of the assembled magnetic tape cartridge 1. The recess 28 is contiguous with the opening 22. The forward rearward dimension of the recess 28 matches that of the opening 22. The lower portion 35a of the slider 35 rests within the recess 28 and is therefore exposed from the lower surface of the magnetic disk cartridge 1. The lower edge 29 of the section 25 is bevelled along the edge facing away from the recess 28. The bevelled edge 29 serves as a guide when the magnetic disk cartridge is being assembled. In the preferred construction, the whole body of the slider 35 or at least the vertical projection 36 of the slider 35 is dyed a different color than the cartridge casing 2 to provide good visual contrast. This color indicia makes it easier to recognize the recording status of magnetic disk cartridge at a glance. To assemble the slider 35 onto the lower casing 5, the slider 35 is slid into engagement with the lower casing 4 in the direction shown by the arrow in Fig. 3. At this time, the lower surface of the upper horizontal leg portion 35b passes over the cut out 25 and the vertical connecting portion 35c passes through the opening 23. The lower horizontal leg portion 35a comes into contact with the bevelled edge 29. As the slider 35 is driven forcibly onto the lower casing 5, the lower horizontal leg portion 35a is elastically or resiliently deformed as the slider 35 slides over the bevelled edge 29. Therefore, when the lower horizontal leg portion 35a is sufficiently deformed to pass over the bevel 29, the slider 35 can be slid into engagement with the lower casing 5. At this time, the upper horizontal leg portion 35b of the slider 35 is positioned in the space 26c and the lower horizontal section 35a is received within the recess 28. Then, the upper casing 4 is fitted onto the lower casing 5. In this state, the upper casing 4 is fastened to the lower casing 5 in a way which precludes significant vertical, longitudinal, or transverse displacement. During assembly, a vertical displacement of the slider 35 is restricted by engagement between the upper and lower horizontal leg portions 35b and 35a and the click plate 26. A longitudinal displacement of the slider 35 away from the lower casing 5 is prevented by the edge 29 of the section 6a of the side wall 6, which extends downwardly to form the outer periphery of the recess 28. Finally, the transverse movement of the slider 35 is restricted by a detent engagement between the downward projection 37 of the upper horizontal leg portion 35b and the click plate 26 and the click rib 27. Therefore, the slider 35 is sufficiently securely retained in place. After assembly, the slider 35 is placed at the position as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In this position, the downward projection 37 of the upper horizontal leg section 35b engages the first bevelled edge 27a of the click rib 27. Therefore, the slider 35 is resiliently retained in this initial position. As will be appreciated, at the position of the slider 35 shown in Figs. 6 and 7, one face of the vertical connection portion 35c of the slider 35 abuts the rib 24. In this condition, the opening 22 is closed by the slider 35. Therefore, a disk condition detector member of the recording and reproducing device cannot enter the opening 22. In this circumstance, data can be written onto the magnetic disk 3 as the writing head not shown of the recording and reproducing device can enter the magnetic disk cartridge 1 to gain access to the recording surface of the magnetic disk 3. Furthermore, when the slider 35 is in this position, the window 34 in the upper casing 4 fully overlaps the upper edge of the upward projection 36. Therefore, as seen from outside, the window 34 is filled by the contrasting upper edge of the upward projection 36 of the slider 35. As set forth, the slider 35 is retained at this position by a detent engagement of the downward projection 37 on the horizontal leg portion 35b of the slider 35. This position of the slider 35 corresponds to the enable position mentioned above. When applying force to shift the slider out of the write enabled position shown in solid lines in Figs. 7 and 8 to the write inhibited position shown in phantom line in Figs. 7 and 9, the upper horizontal section 35b of the slider 35 is resiliently deformed, as shown in Fig. 8. Specifically, in order to shift from the write enabled position to the write inhibited position, the slider 35 is shifted to the left as seen in Figs. 7 and 9. A manually applied leftward force on the slider 35 causes the left side of the downward projection 37 to come into contact with the inclined bevel 27a of the click rib 27. Since the bevel 27a is inclined, the upper horizontal section 35b is deformed upwardly as shown in phantom line in Fig. 8. As shown, the recess 32 accommodates the upward lift on the horizontal leg portion 35b as the downward projection 37 rides upwardly on the bevel 27a and thus raises the resilient leg portion 35b, while the slider 35 is moved leftwardly. The recess 32 formed in the upper casing 4 and the space thus defined over the click plate 26 allow upward deformation of the upper horizontal section 35b. As part of the upward deformation of the upper horizontal section 35b, the upward projection 36 also shifts upwardly. Thus, the upward projection 36 is free to enter the groove 33 and thus does not abut against the upper casing 4. Therefore, the slider 35 is free to move to the left due to the clearances around the upper horizontal section and the upward projection. Following further leftward movement, the slider 35 reaches the position illustrated in phantom lines in Figs. 7 and 9 which position corresponds to the write inhibited position of the slider 35. In this position, the vertical section 35c of the slider 35 is separated from the rib 24 and thus exposes the openings 23 and 22. Therefore, the disk condition detector of the recording and reproducing apparatus can enter the uncovered opening 22. Thus, writing of data onto the magnetic disk 3 is inhibited. At the same time, the upward projection 36 of the slider 35 is shifted away from the window 34 of the upper casing 4. As a result, the upward projection 36 disappears from view. On the other hand, the lower horizontal section 35a can be seen from below to be shifted to the inhibiting position. It should be appreciated that although the slider position fully closing the opening 22 is referred to as the write enabled position and the slider position fully exposing the opening 22 is referred to as the inhibit position, the slider 35 can be arranged to be used in the opposite way. For instance, in certain recording and reproducing devices, the fully closed position of the slider 35 can be the inhibit position and the fully exposed position of the slider can be the enable position. While the present invention has been disclosed in terms of the preferred embodiment of the invention in order to facilitate a full understanding of the invention, it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be limited to the specific embodiment illustrated above.
