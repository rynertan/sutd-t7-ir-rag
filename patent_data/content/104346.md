# INSOLUBLE CHELATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
The present invention relates to insoluble compositions, which are capable of removing metal e.g. selectively from solution eg. Fe³ from a liquid nutrient medium so as to lower the Fe³ content to less than 0.1 µM the insoluble compositions comprise a suitable insoluble carrier and organic co ordinating sites covalently fixed to the surface of said carrier, said co ordinating sites being capable of chelat ing Fe³ , Th⁴ and or UO₂² .
