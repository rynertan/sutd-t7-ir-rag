# Pinless haulage drive chain and rack form link for use seriatim in forming same.

## Abstract
A rack form link component 10 has at its opposite ends complementary shaped parts one of which has a projection 11 of T shape in plan view and the other of which has a recess 12 of T shape in plan view to receive as a clearance fit the projection 11 of an adjoining link component 10 . The link component 10 also has a central spine of upstanding rack formation and integral therewith on either side thereof two walls 26,27 of the same length but one 27 vertically deeper than the other 26 thus forming a saddle. The wall 26 of lesser depth is to be used as trapping means for a mineral mining machine on its traverse along a conveyor, and the deeper wall 27 is to be econompassed by trapping means for the link itself via a shoulder 28 extending from this wall. Locating means on the link component 10 is situated within the saddle and is in the form of a block 31 positioned on the underside of the rack formation spine. A pinless haulage drive chain co operable with a drive roller means comprises a series of like rack form link components 10 each as above and loosely interfitted seriatim. A scraper chain conveyor comprises conveyor line pans and a mining machine moveable therealong. The pans 35 have attached thereto elongate box sections 36 each approximating to the length of a conveyor pan 35 and carrying on its top surface a spine 37 of rectangular cross section secured to and extending longitudinally of the box section. The spine 37 has along the length of its top surface a series of cavities 38,39,40 of which one 40 is positioned approximately midway of the length of the spine 37 and is dimensioned to be a locating fit for the block 31 at the underside of the upper wall of a rack form link component 10 of a pinless haulage drive chain as above set forth and of which the others 38,39 are symmetrical about the cavity 40 and are clearance fits in the first case for the remaining blocks 31 within the set of successive link components 10 co operating with the spine 37 and in the second case for the lower part of the interfitting formations at the ends of the successive link components 10 of the set. The summation of the clearances between projections 11 and recesses 12 in the set of successive link components 10 is at least equal to the total movement obtainable between any pair of conveyor pans 35 .
