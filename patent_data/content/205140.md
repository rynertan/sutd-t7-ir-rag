# DYNAMICALLY VARIABLE LINEAR CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A constant current source is coupled to first sides of a parallel arrangement of binary weighted capacitors. The re maining sides of the capacitors are coupled in parallel to a digital register circuit such as a flip flop. The rate of change of the voltage output signal from the circuit is linear and the slope is determined by the selection of capacitors made in response to the data stored in the register. Similarly, a circuit is constructed in which a time delay or RC time constant is generated which is linearly related to the binary value of the data stored in the register by replacing the constant current source with a resistance circuit.
