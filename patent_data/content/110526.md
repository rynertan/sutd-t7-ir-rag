# Oval dual AC capacitor package.

## Abstract
Two wound metallized polypropylene capacitor sec tions 10, 26 of cylindrical dimensions are housed in an oval metal can 56 . One capacitor section 26 forms a sin gle capacitor of two metal film electrodes 12, 14 . One me tal film electrode 14 of the other capacitor section 10 is opened or interrupted in the winding. The uninterrupted other film electrode 12 of this other section is terminated at the bottom end 36 while the two interrupted inner and outer winding films 14a, 14b are separately terminated at the top end 32, 34 . The bottoms 30, 36 of both capacitor sections 10, 26 are connected together and to a feed through terminal 50 . Said outer film 14b is connected via a conductive strap 38 to the top termination 28 of the one section 26 and to a second terminal 52 , while the inner film 14a is connected only to a third terminal 48 . In this way, an optimally dense oval package provides two capaci tors at the package terminals that may have a ratio of values ranging from 3 to 12, ideally suited for use in air condi tioners.
