# Selective plating.

## Abstract
A method of selective plating a component 1 , which method comprises contacting a lower face of the component 1 with a contoured lower mask 17 having a plating aperture so as to expose an area of the component 1 to be plated, positioning the component 1 over a plating tank and selective plating the component 1 with a plating medium 19 , wherein the cross sectional area of the plating aperture is enlarged at the surface of the component 1 so as to define one or more cavities 18 in which the plating rate is lower than elsewhere in the plating aperture.
