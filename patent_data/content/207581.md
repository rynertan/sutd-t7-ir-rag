Where Ar represents a divalent carbocyclic aromatic group, this may be substituted or unsubstituted and has from 6 to 10 ring carbon atoms. Examples of such divalent aromatic groups include the Where Ar represents a divalent aromatic heterocyclic group, the heterocyclic group is preferably a pyridine, furan, thiophene or pyrrole ring, which may be unsubstituted or have at least one of the substituents d defined above, and the two free valences may be in a variety of positions. Specific examples of such groups are as follows, in which the first number given denotes the position of attachment of the heterocyclic group to the group of formula CH₂ W may represent a methylene CH₂ group, a carbonyl C O group, a group of formula CH OR¹¹ in which R¹¹ is as defined above or a group of formula C NOR¹² where R¹² is as defined above and may be the same as or different from the atom or group represented by R³ .

Alternatively, W and U may together form a double bond, e.g. as illustrated by the compounds of formula I 12 described hereafter. U preferably represents a methylene group. However, as mentioned above, it may form a double bond with W, or, when W represents a carbonyl group or a group of formula C N OR¹², U may, together with R¹ and the carbon atom to which the group represented by R¹ is attached, form a group of formula CH C , e.g. as illustrated in the compounds of formulae I 8 to I 11 , defined hereafter.

Where the compounds of the present invention contain an acidic group in their molecule, for example where they contain a carboxy group or where R³ represents a hydrogen atom and the resulting hydroxy group is of an acidic character or where R³ represents a sulpho SO₃H group, then the compounds of the invention may form salts with cations. There is no limitation upon the nature of such salts, provided that, where they are to be used for therapeutic purposes, they are pharmaceutically acceptable, which, as is well known in the art, means that they do not have reduced activity or unacceptably reduced activity or increased toxicity or unacceptably increased toxicity compared with the free compound of formula I . Where, however, they are to be used for non therapeutic purposes, e.g. as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds, even this limitation does not apply. Suitable salts include, for example alkali metal salts, such as the sodium or potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts, such as the calcium or magnesium salts other metal salts, such as the aluminium or iron salts salts with basic amino acids, such as the lysine or arginine salts ammonium salts and salts with organic amines, such as the cyclohexylammonium, diisopropylammonium and triethylammonium salts. The compounds of the invention may also, depending upon the particular substituents, contain basic groups in their molecules and, in such a case, they can also form acid addition salts. As with the salts mentioned above, there is no particular limitation on the nature of the acid forming such a salt, provided that, where the compound is to be used for therapeutic purposes, the resulting salt is pharmaceutically acceptable.

Also preferred are pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the above compounds. The compounds of the invention including those compounds defined above and covered by prior EP A 0139421 may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II This compound may immediately be hydrolized under the prevailing reaction conditions if it is not, then a separate hydrolysis step is required, to hydrolize the imino group at the 2 position of the thiazolidine ring and, where Y represents an imino group, to hydrolize that imino group also, to an oxygen atom, thereby giving the compound of formula IV If necessary, subsequent steps may be carried out to replace various of the substituent groups by other groups within the definitions given above, employing the reactions described in more detail hereafter. Where A represents a C₂ C₆ alkoxycarbonyl group i.e. the alkoxy part has from 1 to 5 carbon atoms , examples of such groups include the methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, propoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl and butoxycarbonyl groups. Where A represents a group of formula COOM and M represents a cation, the nature of the cation is not critical to the invention, since it is eliminated in the course of the reaction. Preferably the cation is a metal ion, such as a sodium, potassium, calcium or aluminium ion, but it may also be an ammonium ion and other ions, including ions derived from organic bases, are possible, although not presently preferred. X represents a halogen atom and, again, the nature of this is not critical, since the atom is eliminated in the course of the reaction. Most suitably, the halogen atom represented by X is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. The reaction of the compound of formula II with the thiourea is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent. The nature of the solvent is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane ketones, such as acetone dimethyl sulphoxide sulphones, such as sulpholane and amides, such as dimethylformamide. There is no criticality as to the molar ratio of the compound of formula II to the thiourea and so conventional criteria apply to determine the most suitable proportions. Preferably the two reagents are employed in equimolar amounts or the thiourea is employed in excess, preferably a slight excess. The most suitable ratio of thiourea to compound of formula II is from 1 1 to 2 1. The reaction temperature is not critical to the invention, although the optimum temperature will vary, depending upon the nature of the reagents and the solvent employed. In general, we prefer to carry out the reaction at the boiling point of the solvent or at a temperature within the range from 80 to 150 C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents, but a period of from 1 to 20 hours will normally suffice. Where hydrolysis of the resulting compound of formula V is required as a separate step, this may be effected by heating the compound of formula V in a suitable solvent in the presence of water and of an acid. The nature of the solvent is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction and examples of suitable solvents include sulpholane and alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. Suitable acids include such organic acids as acetic acid and such mineral acids as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid. The amount of acid added is preferably from 0.1 to 10 moles, more preferably from 0.2 to 3 moles, per mole of the compound of formula V . The water or aqueous solvent employed in this hydrolysis is preferably added in stoichiometric excess with respect to the compound of formula V , preferably a large excess. The reaction temperature is not particularly critical, although we prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 50 to 100 C, at which temperature the reaction will normally be essentially complete within a period of from 2 to 20 hours. Where R³ in the compound of formula V represents an acyl group, the hydrolysis step will often hydrolize this to a hydrogen atom, giving a compound of formula IVH Compounds of formula IV can exist in the following tautomeric forms Those compounds of the invention which contain one or more carboxy groups or which contain a phenolic hydroxy group e.g. where R³ represents a hydrogen atom, as in the compounds of formula IVH can form salts, in a conventional manner, with cations. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the cations employed to form such salts, except that, where the compounds of the invention are to be used for therapeutic purposes, the resulting salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, which, as is well known in the art, means that the resulting salts should not have a reduced activity or unacceptably reduced activity or an increased toxicity or unacceptably increased toxicity as compared with the parent compound. On the other hand, where the compounds are to be used for non therapeutic purposes, e.g. where they are to be used as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds, even this restriction does not apply. Suitable salts include, for example alkali metal salts, such as the sodium, potassium or lithium salts alkaline earth metal salts, such as the calcium or magnesium salts salts with other metals, especially trivalent metals, for example salts with aluminium, iron, cobalt, nickel or zinc ammonium salts salts with organic amines, for example the triethylamine or cyclohexylamine salts and salts with basic amino acids, for example lysine or arginine. The compounds of the invention may be converted into such salts simply by a conventional reaction with an appropriate base. Likewise, where the compounds of the invention contain a basic group, they can form acid addition salts. As with the salts mentioned above, where the compounds are to be used for therapeutic purposes, the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable but, where they are to be used for non therapeutic purposes, this restriction does not apply. Suitable acids for use in producing such salts include inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid organic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, glutamic acid or aspartic acid and organic sulphonic acids, such as Furthermore, compounds of formula IVH can be converted into a corresponding ester by reaction with an acylating agent, normally an organic acid or reactive derivative thereof. Suitable reactive derivatives include the acid halides and acid anhydrides, especially the acid anhydrides. Where an acid itself is employed, we prefer to carry out the reaction in the presence, as catalyst, of a strong acid, for example a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or an organic sulphonic acid such as Otherwise, the nature of the acylating agent employed depends upon the nature of the acyl group which it is desired to introduce, and these are defined above as the acyl groups which may be represented by R³. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, cyclohexane or heptane halogenated hydrocarbons, especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or chloroform ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide organic bases, such as pyridine or triethylamine sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide sulphones, such as sulpholane water and mixtures of any two or more thereof. There is no particular restriction on the ratio of the compound of formula IVH to the acylating agent, but we generally prefer to employ an excess, suitably a slight excess, of the acylating agent or an equimolar amount of the two reagents. In general, we would employ a molar ratio of acylating agent to compound of formula IVH of from 1 1 to 10 1. The reaction temperature is not critical and the reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures however, we generally prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 0 C to 100 C. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but, at a temperature within the recommended range, a period of from 5 minutes to 20 hours will normally suffice. Compounds of the invention in which W represents a hydroxymethylene group, that is to say compounds of formula VI Reaction of the compound of formula VII with the reducing agent is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent. The nature of the solvent is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. There is also no criticality as to the ratio of the compound of formula VII to the reducing agent, although an excess of the reducing agent is generally preferred. In general, we prefer to employ a molar ratio of reducing agent to compound of formula VII of from 1 1 to 20 1. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures and the particular reaction temperature chosen is not particularly critical. We generally prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 0 C to 100 C. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reducing agent, but a period of from 1 to 20 hours will normally suffice. The resulting compounds of formula VI can, if desired, be converted to the corresponding acyl derivatives of formula VIII The nature of the reagents, solvent, proportions of reagents and reaction conditions such as temperature and reaction time, are as described above in relation to the acylation of a compound of formula IVH to give the corresponding ester. In view of this, depending upon the precise reaction conditions, where the compound of formula VI used as starting material is a compound in which R³ represents a hydrogen atom, then that hydrogen atom may simultaneously be replaced by an acyl group to give a compound of formula VIII in which both R³ and R¹¹a represent the same acyl group. Compounds of the invention in which W and U together form a carbon carbon double bond, that is to say compounds of formula IX Elimination of water or of the acid R¹¹aOH from the compound of formula VI or VIII may be effected by contacting the compound with an acid catalyst in a solvent alternatively, if an acidic solvent is employed, then no additional acid catalyst is required. Suitable acid catalysts include inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid organic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid and organic sulphonic acids, such as There is no particular restriction on the ratio of the compound of formula VI or VIII to the acidic catalyst. However, we generally prefer to employ a molar ratio of said compound to said catalyst of from 1 0.001 to 1 1, more preferably from 1 0.01 to 1 0.1. Where an acidic solvent is to be employed, we prefer to use an organic acid, particularly an organic carboxylic acid, such as acetic acid. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, although we generally prefer to employ a temperature of from 0 C to 100 C. The time required for the reaction may vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 5 minutes to 20 hours will normally suffice. Compounds of formula IX may also be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding imino compound of formula X The compound of formula X may be prepared from the compound of formula V by a series of reactions analogous to those employed to prepare the compound of formula IX from the compound of formula VII , employing the same reagents and reaction conditions. The hydrolysis reaction employed is the same as that employed to convert the compound of formula V into the compound of formula IV and may be carried out under the same conditions and employing the same reagents as described in the context of that reaction. As with that reaction, the hydrolysis in this reaction may lead to removal of any acyl group represented by R³ and its replacement by a hydrogen atom, to give a compound of formula IXH Compounds of formula I in which W represents a methylene group, that is to say compounds of formula XI This hydrogenation is preferably effected in the presence of a catalyst, for example palladium on carbon, Raney nickel or platinum oxide, of which palladium on carbon is preferred. The partial pressure of hydrogen is preferably from 1 to 100 atmospheres about 1 to 101 bars , more preferably from 1 to 6 atmospheres about 1 to 6 bars . The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran organic acids, such as acetic acid amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide water and mixtures of any two or more thereof. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, but we normally find it convenient to carry out the reaction at a temperature within the range from room temperature to 50 C. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 5 minutes to 20 hours will normally suffice, where a temperature within the recommended range is employed. Compounds of formula I in which W represents a carbonyl group and U, R¹ and the carbon atom to which R¹ is attached together represent a group of formula CH C , that is to say a compound of formula XII In the above formulae, L represents a group of formula OR³, in which R³ is as defined above, and U represents a methylene group alternatively, U, L and the carbon atom to which the group represented by L is attached together form a group of formula CH C . The reactions of the compound of formula XIII with thiourea and the hydrolysis of the compound of formula XIV thus produced to give the desired compound of formula XII are similar to the reactions of the compound of formula II with thiourea to give the compound of formula V and the hydrolysis of this to give the compound of formula IV and may be carried out employing the same reagents and under the same reaction conditions. Compounds of formulae X , IXH , XI , XII and XIV exist as tautomeric forms, analogous to those already described above in relation to compounds of formulae IV , VI , VIII and IX , although all such tautomers are represented herein by a single formula only, for convenience. Compounds of formula I in which W represents a group of formula C N OR¹²a, that is to say compounds of formula XV The compounds of formulae XV and XVI can exist in tautomeric forms, for example as follows in relation to the compound of formula XV The nature of the hydroxylamine derivative of formula XVII depends upon the nature of the group NOR¹²a which it is desired to introduce into the compound. The hydroxylamine derivative may be employed in the form of a salt thereof, for example a salt with a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid. The reaction may be effected in the presence of an acid binding agent. Where an acid binding agent is employed, it is preferably an alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide or an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate . The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Examples of suitable solvents include alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide sulphones, such as sulpholane organic bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine water and mixtures of any two or more thereof. There is no particular limitation on the molar ratio of the hydroxylamine derivative of formula XVII to the compound of formula XVI and the reaction will take place at any molar ratio. However, we generally prefer to employ an excess of the hydroxylamine derivative, preferably a large excess, with respect to the compound of formula XVI . A preferred molar ratio of the hydroxylamine derivative XVII to the compound of formula XVI is from 1 1 to 50 1. If an acid addition salt of the hydroxylamine derivative XVII is employed, then we prefer to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid binding agent. The amount of acid binding agent is not critical and an amount less than equimolar with respect to the salt of the hydroxylamine derivative can be employed. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures and the particular temperature chosen is not critical. We prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature within the range from 0 C to 100 C. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but, at temperatures within the preferred range given above, a period of from 5 minutes to 10 days will normally suffice. Compounds of formula I in which W represents a group of formula C N O R The compounds of formula XVIII can exist in the form of tautomers, analogous to those defined above in relation to the other similar compounds. However, for convenience, these tautomers are all represented herein by a single formula XVIII . The acylation reaction of this compound of formula XIX to give the compound of formula XVIII is essentially the same as the reaction employed to acylate the compound of formula IVH and may be carried out under the same conditions and employing the same reagents, solvents, etc. as described heretofore in relation to that acylation reaction. The compounds of the invention in which W represents a group of formula C N OR¹² in which R¹² is as defined above , that is to say the oxime, oxime ether and oxime ester compounds, i.e. compounds of formulae XV , XVIII and XIX , can exist in both the syn and anti forms, and both forms are included within the scope of the present invention. These oxime, oxime ether and oxime ester compounds can be converted into their salts by conventional means. As with the salts described previously, there is no particular limitation on the nature of the salt, provided that, where the salt is to be employed for therapeutic purposes, it should be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable salts include alkali metal salts, such as the sodium or potassium salt alkaline earth metal salts, such as the calcium salt and salts with trivalent metals, such as the aluminium salt. However, other salts, including those other ones described above can also be formed. Compounds of the invention in which R⁶ and or R⁷ represents an alkyl group or substituted alkyl group, i.e. compounds of formula XX The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an acid binding agent. The purpose of the acid binding agent is to remove from the reaction system the hydrogen halide HX produced by the reaction and any compound capable of doing this may be employed. Examples of suitable acid binding agents include alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide alkali metal bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as calcium hydroxide alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride or potassium hydride alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide organic lithium compounds, such as butyllithium or t butyllithium lithium dialkylamides, such as lithium diisopropylamide or lithium dicyclohexylamide and organic bases, such as pyridine or triethylamine. Of these, the alkali metal carbonates, especially potassium carbonate, are preferred. The relative proportions of the base and the compound of formula XXI are not particularly critical and may vary over a wide range. For example, a molar ratio of base to compound XXI of from 0.5 1 to 20 1 is preferred, more preferably from 1 1 to 10 1. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane or cyclohexane amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, sulphones, such as sulpholane halogenated hydrocarbons, especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform or 1,2 dichloroethane organic bases, such as pyridine or triethylamine water and mixtures of any two or more thereof. The molar ratio of the compound of formula XXI to the alkyl halide of formula XXII is not particularly critical but, in order to ensure that the reaction goes to completion, we prefer to employ an excess of the alkyl halide. In general, the molar ratio of the alkyl halide to the compound of formula XXI is from 0.5 1 to 20 1, more preferably from 1 1 to 10 1. Where only a group R The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures and the particular reaction temperature is not particularly critical. We generally prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 10 C to 100 C, more preferably from 15 to 40 C. The time required for the reaction may vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents, however, at a temperature within the preferred range, a period of from 10 minutes to several days, more commonly from 1 hour to 4 days, will normally suffice. Where only R Where both R The reaction normally takes place preferentially at the nitrogen atom at the 3 position of the thiazolidine ring and, accordingly, where the quantity of alkyl halide XXII is restricted, the principal product will normally be a compound in which the alkyl or substituted alkyl group has been introduced at that position. Where R⁷a represents a hydrogen atom in the compound of formula XXI , it is possible to replace this by an alkyl or substituted alkyl group by this reaction and, provided sufficient alkyl halide XXII is employed, disubstitution will take place. Where a compound in which R⁶ and or R⁷ represents a carboxyalkyl group is required, we prefer to employ a compound of formula XXII in which R²⁰ represents an alkoxycarbonylalkyl or substituted alkoxycarbonylalkyl group, to give the corresponding compound of formula XX where R Compounds of the invention in which R³ represents a sulpho HSO₃ group or an esterified sulpho group of formula SO₃R⁸, i.e. compounds of formula XXIII The reaction is similar to the reaction to introduce an alkyl or substituted alkyl group R In all of the compounds of the invention, the carbon atom at the 5 position of the thiazolidine ring is asymmetric. Moreover, when R¹ represents an atom or a group i.e. it does not, together with U, form a double bond , the carbon atom at the 2 position of the chroman ring is asymmetric. When W represents a group of formula CH OR¹¹, then the carbon atom at the 4 position of the chroman ring is also asymmetric. It will, therefore, be appreciated that a variety of isomers of the compounds of the invention are possible, as a result of different configurations of substituent groups about these asymmetric carbon atoms. Although all such isomers are represented herein by a single formula only, the present invention envisages both the individual isolated isomers and mixtures thereof. The compounds of the invention may be produced in the form of individual isomers by using an isolated isomer as the starting material or by stereospecific synthesis techniques. Alternatively, the compounds may be produced as a mixture of such isomers, in which case they may be employed in the form of such a mixture or the individual isomers may be separated by conventional resolution techniques. The compounds of the invention obtained by any of the reactions discussed above may be isolated and purified by conventional techniques, including any one or more of the following concentration evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure extraction with a solvent crystallization and recrystallization solvent transfer chromatography techniques, especially column chromatography and thin layer chromatography and optical resolution. The α halocarboxylic acid derivatives of formula II employed as starting materials in the processes of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods, for example as follows. Method A is the method described in more detail in copending European Patent Publication No. 0139421 and prepares compounds where W and U both represent methylene groups, that is to say compounds of formula XXX , as illustrated in the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R¹ R⁵, R⁷a, Ar, The chroman carboxylic acid homologues XXXI , which are the starting materials for this Method, may be prepared as described, for example, in the Journal of the American Oil Chemists Society, These acids XXXI are reduced with a reducing agent, such as lithium aluminium hydride or Vitride sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminium hydride , to give the corresponding chroman alcohol homologue XXXII . This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it does not interfere with the reaction. Suitable solvents include ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene and aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, ligroin or ethylcyclohexane. The ratio of the amount of acid XXXI to reducing agent is not particularly critical, but we generally prefer to use a slight molar excess of reducing agent. Preferably the amount of reducing agent is from 1 to 2 moles per mole of acid XXXI . The reaction conditions, particularly the reaction temperature and time, will vary depending upon many factors, such as the nature of the starting material, the reducing agent and the solvent, but the reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of from 0 to 100 C. At such a temperature, a reaction period of from 10 minutes to 20 hours will normally suffice. Alternatively, the chroman alcohol homologue XXXII may be prepared by reacting a hydroquinone with a compound of formula XXXV The chroman alcohol homologues of formula XXXII obtained in step A1 may be converted to the corresponding nitrophenoxyalkyl chroman compounds XXXIII . However, before carrying out this reaction, we prefer that the phenolic hydroxy group should be protected by a hydroxy protecting group R³⁰. The nature of the hydroxy protecting group is not critical and any such group commonly used in this type of reaction and compound may be employed. Suitable groups include alkoxyalkyl groups, such as the methoxymethyl group alkoxycarbonylalkyl groups, such as the ethoxycarbonylmethyl, t butoxycarbonylmethyl, 1 methoxycarbonyl 1 methylethyl and 1 t butoxy carbonyl 1 methylethyl groups aralkyl groups, such as the benzyl group the 2 tetrahydropyranyl group and acyl groups, such as the acetyl or benzoyl groups. The alkoxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl and 2 tetrahydropyranyl groups are preferred. The reaction is normally effected by contacting a compound R³⁰X in which R³⁰ is as defined above and X represents a halogen atom, preferably a chlorine atom , such as methoxymethyl chloride, ethoxycarbonylmethyl bromide, 1 t butoxycarbonyl 1 methylethyl bromide, benzoyl chloride or benzyl chloride, more preferably methoxymethyl chloride or benzoyl chloride, with the compound of formula XXXII in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydride e.g. sodium hydride or calcium hydride or an alkali metal alkoxide e.g. sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium t butoxide . The reaction is normally carried out in the presence of a solvent, for example an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, toluene or xylene an aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as hexane or heptane an amide, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide a sulphoxide, such as dimethyl sulphoxide or a sulphone, such as sulpholane. There is no particular limitation on the molar ratio of compound XXXII to the compound R³⁰X. In general, we prefer to employ from about 0.8 to 1.2 mole of the compound R³⁰X per mole of the compound XXXII . The reaction conditions, particularly the reaction temperature and time, may vary depending upon a number of factors, especially the natures of the starting material, the compound R³⁰X and the solvent, but we normally prefer a reaction temperature of from 0 to 50 C and a time of from several minutes to several tens of minutes. The protected chroman alcohol produced by this reaction can, if desired, be isolated and purified, but it may be, and preferably is, converted to the nitrophenoxyalkylchroman compound of formula XXXIII without intermediate isolation. Conversion to the compound of formula XXXIII is effected by reacting the protected compound XXXII with a halonitroaryl compound, e.g. a 4 or 3 halonitrobenzene, of formula X Ar NO₂ in which X and Ar are as defined above in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent, such as dimethyl sulphoxide or dimethylformamide. The amount of halonitroaryl compound employed is preferably about 2 moles per mole of protected compound XXXII . The reaction temperature is preferably from 30 to 100 C and the time required for the reaction is usually from several minutes to several hours. The nitro compound of formula XXXIII thus obtained is reduced in this step to the corresponding amino compound of formula XXXIV . In the course of or before or after this reduction, the protecting group R³⁰ may be allowed to remain as it is, be removed or be converted to another group particularly an acyl group, such as an acetyl or benzoyl group . When deprotection of the compound XXXIII is desired, this can easily be achieved by reacting the compound XXXIII with a dilute aqueous acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or nitric acid to hydrolyse the protecting group. The reaction is normally carried out in the presence of a solvent, for example an alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol and ether, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone an organic acid, such as acetic acid or propionic acid dimethyl sulphoxide dimethylformamide or water. Of these, water or an organic acid is preferred. The amount of acid used for hydrolysis is preferably from 0.01 to 5 moles, more preferably from 0.01 to 1 mole, per mole of the compound XXXIII . We prefer to carry out the reaction in the presence of a large molar excess of water or of acetic acid as the solvent. The reaction temperature is preferably from ambient temperature to 100 C and the time required for the reaction is normally from several minutes to about 20 hours. If it is desired to convert the protecting group R³⁰ to another group, particularly an acyl group, this may be achieved by acylation of the deprotected compound obtained as described above. The acylating agent may be an acid halide, such acetyl chloride or benzoyl chloride, or an acid anhydride, such as acetic anhydride. This reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an organic amine such as pyridine or triethylamine or in the presence of an inorganic base for example an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate . The acylating reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent, for example an aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, ligroin or ethylcyclohexane an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, toluene or xylene an organic amine, such as pyridine or triethylamine a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone an amide, such as dimethylformamide a sulphoxide, such as dimethyl sulphoxide or water. The ratio of the amount of deprotected compound XXXIII to acylating agent is not particularly critical, however, a slight molar excess of acylating agent is usually preferred, for example from 1 to 1.5 moles of acylating agent per mole of deprotected compound XXXIII . Where an organic amine is employed as the acid binding agent, it may be employed in any amount from 1 mole to a large molar excess per mole of the compound of formula XXXIII . Where an inorganic base is employed as the acid binding agent, it is preferably employed in an amount of from 1 to 10 moles per mole of the compound of formula XXXIII . The reaction conditions, particularly the reaction temperature and time, may vary depending upon a number of factors, particularly the natures of the starting material and solvent employed, but the reaction is preferably effected at a temperature of from 0 to 100 C for a period of from several minutes to 20 hours. The nitro compound of formula XXXIII which may optionally have been subjected to any of the processes described above is then reduced to the amino compound of formula XXXIV . The reduction may be a catalytic reduction process employing hydrogen, or reduction with a metal such as zinc or iron and an acid which may be a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or an organic acid such as acetic acid . Preferably a catalytic reduction process is employed. The catalyst employed for this catalytic reduction is preferably palladium on carbon, Raney nickel or platinum oxide, of which palladium on carbon is particularly preferred. The hydrogen pressure is preferably from 1 to 100 atmospheres about 1 to 101 bars , more preferably from 1 to 6 atmospheres about 1 to 6 bars . The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran organic acids, such as acetic acid water or mixtures of any two or more thereof. The reaction conditions, particularly the reaction temperature and time, may vary depending upon a number of factors, particularly the nature of the starting material, the method employed for reduction and the solvent, but the reaction is normally effected at a temperature from ambient temperature to 50 C and the period required for the reaction is generally from several minutes to about 20 hours. The chroman derivative of formula XXXIV , prepared as described in step A3 above, is diazotized and then subjected to a Meerwein arylation, to give the desired α halocarboxylic acid compound of formula XXX . The two reactions are preferably effected sequentially in the same reaction system. The diazotization reaction comprises reacting the amino compound of formula XXXIV with a nitrite such as sodium nitrite in the presence of an acid, such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid. The Meerwein arylation reaction comprises reacting the resulting diazonium compound with an acrylic compound of formula CH₂ CR⁷aA in which R⁷a and A are as defined above , e.g. acrylic acid, an acrylic or methacrylic acid ester such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate or ethyl methacrylate or another acrylic acid derivative such as acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methacrylonitrile or methacrylamide , in the presence of a catalytic amount of a cuprous compound which may be a salt, such as cuprous chloride, or another cuprous compound such as cuprous oxide . The acrylic and methacrylic acid esters are preferred and the preferred cuprous compound is cuprous oxide. The reactions are preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it does not interfere with the reactions. Suitable solvents include alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone water or a mixture of any two or more thereof. The molar ratio of the amino compound of formula XXXIV to the acrylic acid or derivative thereof of formula CH₂ CR⁷aA is preferably from 1 1 to 1 15, more preferably from 1 5 to 1 10. The molar ratio of the amino compound XXXIV to the cuprous compound is preferably from 1 0.01 to 1 1, more preferably from 1 0.03 to 1 0.3. The reaction conditions, particularly the reaction temperature and time, may vary depending upon a number of factors, especially the natures of the starting materials and the solvent employed, but the reaction is normally carried out at a temperature from ambient temperature to 100 C, preferably from 30 to 60 C, and the period required for the reaction is normally from about 20 minutes to about 20 hours, more preferably from 30 minutes to 2 hours. This method may also be used to prepare compounds of formula II in which both W and U represent methylene groups and is especially useful for preparing compounds in which In the above reaction scheme, R¹ R⁵ are as defined above, R³¹ represents an alkyl group and Me represents the methyl group. In this reaction, the chroman alcohol of formula XXXIIa or its analogues in which This method is also useful for synthesizing compounds of formula II in which both W and U represent methylene groups. This method may be carried out as illustrated by the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R², R⁴, R⁵ and R³⁰ are as defined above R¹a represents any one of the groups heretofore defined for R¹, other than the hydrogen atom and R³² represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxy protecting group, preferably an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl or optionally substituted phenyl group, more preferably a C₁ C₄ alkyl group. These steps are carried out essentially as described in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, In this step, the phenolic hydroxy group is, if required, protected. We prefer that this hydroxy group should be protected prior to step C6. Examples of protecting groups R³⁰ have been given above in relation to Method A and the method of introducing the protecting group is also as described above in relation to step A2. However, in this step, we prefer to employ the compound R³⁰X in excess, preferably a molar ratio of the compound R³⁰X to the compound of formula XLIII of from 1 1 to 2 1. The reaction is preferably effected at a temperature of from 0 to 50 C, more preferably from 10 to 25 C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, but a period of from several minutes to several hours will normally suffice. The resulting compound of formula XLIV may then be used in step C6 without intermediate isolation. In this step, a chromancarboxylic acid derivative of formula XLV having a protected hydroxy group at the 6 position and a group R¹a at the 2 position is prepared. This may be achieved by reacting the compound of formula XLIV with a base in an inert solvent in order to generate a carbanion and then reacting this carbanion with a compound of formula R¹aX¹ in which R¹a is as defined above and X¹ represents a halogen atom, for example a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, or a sulphonyloxy group, for example a methanesulphonyloxy, ethanesulphonyloxy, benzenesulphonyloxy or Any base may be employed in the reaction to generate the carbanion, and examples of such bases include organic lithium compounds, such as methyllithium, butyllithium, t butyllithium or phenyllithium lithium dialkylamides, such as lithium diisopropylamide, lithium dicyclohexylamide or lithium The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example, ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. The reaction temperature employed for generation of the carbanion is preferably relatively low, e.g. from 78 C to room temperature. The temperature employed for reaction of this anion with the compound of formula R Thereafter, the resulting compound of formula XLV may be subjected to the same reactions as described in Method A, to give the resulting compound of formula XXX . If desired, Step C6 may be omitted, to prepare a compound in which R¹ is a hydrogen atom. This method is also described in copending European Patent Publication No. 0139421 and prepares compounds of formula II in which U represents a methylene group and W represents a carbonyl group, that is to say compounds of formula LI , by the reactions summarized in the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R¹ R⁵, R⁷a, Ar, The acetophenone derivative of formula XLVII which is one of the starting materials for this step may be prepared, for example, as described in Chem. Berichte, In this step, the compounds XLVII and XLVIII are reacted together in the presence of a secondary amine, as described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 19670 77. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum ether, benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane and cyclohexane halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane amides, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and The secondary amine employed in this reaction is preferably a compound of formula Ra NH R The molar ratio of the compound of formula XLVII to the compound of formula XLVIII is not particularly critical, but, to avoid waste, roughly equimolar amounts of the two compounds are used. In general, the amount of secondary amine is preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 moles, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mole, per mole of the compound of formula XLVII or XLVIII . The reaction conditions, particularly reaction temperature and time, may vary depending upon a number of factors, especially the nature of the starting materials and of the solvent, but, in general, we prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 30 C to 150 C, more preferably from 10 to 120 C, for a period of from 30 minutes to 3 days. In this step, the nitro compound of formula XLIX prepared as in step D1 is reduced to the corresponding amino compound of formula L . This reaction is precisely the same as step A3 of Method A, employing the same reaction conditions and reagents. In this step, the amino compound of formula L , obtained as described in step D2, is diazotized and then subjected to a Meerwein arylation, to give the desired α halocarboxylic acid derivative of formula LI . These reactions are precisely the same as those described in step A4 of Method A and may be carried out employing the same reagents and reaction conditions. This method may be used for preparing compounds of formula II in which W represents a carbonyl group and U represents a methylene group, and where there is a group R¹a as defined above at the 2 position of the chroman ring, that is to say compounds of formula LVIII . The reactions involved are summarized in the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R¹a, R², R⁴, R⁵, R³⁰, R³² and Ar are as defined above. R³³ represents a carbonyl protecting group, examples of which are described in more detail below. In this step, the starting material of formula XLII , which may have been prepared as described in step C3 of Method C, is subjected to reduction, but under milder conditions than employed in step C4, so that only the double bond between the 2 and 3 positions is hydrogenated. The reaction is preferably effected by catalytic hydrogenation. Suitable catalysts include palladium on carbon, Raney nickel and platinum oxide, of which palladium on carbon is preferred. The reaction is preferably effected employing a partial pressure of hydrogen of from 1 to 100 atmospheres about 1 to 101 bars , more preferably from 1 to 6 atmospheres about 1 to 6 bars . The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide organic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid water and mixtures of any two or more thereof. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, but we prefer to employ a temperature of from room temperatures to 50 C, more preferably from room temperature to 40 C. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature however, at a temperature within the preferred range described above, the reaction will normally be complete within a period of from several minutes to several days, commonly from 30 minutes to 20 hours. In this step, the carbonyl group at the 4 position of the chroman compound of formula LII prepared in step E1 is protected it is desirable that this protection should be carried out prior to the alkylation reaction of step E4. There is no particular limitation on the nature of the protecting group employed and any such group commonly used for protecting carbonyl groups may equally well be used in the present invention. For example, the oxo compound may be converted into a protected enol compound, such as an enol ether or enol ester. Alternatively, it may be converted into a ketone acetal having cyclic or non cyclic side chains or into a ketone dithioacetal. Conversion into a ketone dithioacetal is preferred. Preferably, R³³ represents a group of formula B¹ B² B¹ , where B¹ represents an oxygen or sulphur atom preferably a sulphur atom and B² represents a group of formula CH₂ ₂ , CH₂ ₃ , CH₂ ₄ or CH₂ CH CH CH₂ cis , preferably CH₂ ₂ or CH₂ ₃ and more preferably CH₂ ₃ . Such a protected compound may be prepared by reacting the compound of formula LII with a compound of formula H B¹ B² B¹ H in which B¹ and B² are as defined above , for example ethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,2 ethanedithiol, 1,3 propanedithiol or cis 2 butene 1,4 diol, preferably 1,3 propanedithiol, under dehydrating conditions. The reaction may take place in the presence or absence of a catalyst. Where a catalyst is employed, suitable catalysts include, for example Lewis acids, such as boron trifluoride or diethyl ether or acetic acid complexes thereof or aluminium chloride inorganic acids, such as hydrogen chloride or sulphuric acid organic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid or maleic acid and organic sulphonic acids, such as The reaction does not always require a solvent however, if a solvent is employed, its nature is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Examples of suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or xylene and halogenated hydrocarbons, especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chloroform or methylene chloride.

Equally, there is no particular limitation on the proportions of catalyst employed. However, a molar ratio of catalyst to compound of formula LII of from 1 1 to 1 4 is preferred. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, but we generally prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 0 to 100 C, more preferably from 10 C to 40 C. The time required for the reaction may vary widely, depending upon the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from several minutes to several days, more commonly from 1 hour to 30 hours, will normally suffice. In this step, the phenolic hydroxy group at the 6 position of the chroman ring is protected, typically by reaction with a compound of formula R³⁰X in which R³⁰ and X are as defined above . This reaction is similar to the reactions described in steps A2 and C5 and is preferably carried out employing the same reagents and under the reaction conditions described in relation to step C5. The resulting compound of formula LIV may be isolated from the reaction mixture or may be used without intermediate isolation directly in step E4. In this step, the compound of formula LIV is converted to a carbanion and then reacted with a compound of formula R¹aX¹ in which R¹a and X¹ are as defined above . This reaction is similar to that described above in relation to step C6 and may be carried out employing the same reagents and under the same reaction conditions as employed in step C6. If it is desired to prepare a compound in which R¹ represents a hydrogen atom, step E4 may be omitted, and the product of step E3 the compound of formula LIV may be employed directly in step E5. In this step, the chroman 2 carboxylic acid derivative of formula LV is reduced to the corresponding alcohol of formula LVI . This reaction is essentially the same as that described above in step A1 of the Method A and may be carried out under the same conditions and employing the same reagents. However, in this case, we prefer to employ a temperature within the range from 50 C to 120 C. In this step, a group of formula Ar NO₂ Ar being as defined above is introduced into the compound of formula LVI prepared as described in step E5. This reaction may be effected by reacting the compound of formula LVI with a base to convert it to the corresponding alkoxide, and then reacting this with a compound of formula X Ar NO₂ in which X and Ar are as defined above . Any base capable of forming an alkoxide with the compound of formula LVI may be employed. Examples include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride or calcium hydride and alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium t butoxide.

Of these, the amides are preferred. The relative proportions of the compound of formula X Ar NO₂ to the compound of formula LVI are not particularly critical to the present invention, however, we prefer to employ a slight excess of the compound of formula X Ar NO₂, preferably a molar ratio of said compound of formula X Ar NO₂ to compound of formula LVI of from 1 1 to 10 1. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, but we generally prefer to employ a temperature of from 30 C to 100 C. The time required for the reaction may vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature. A period of from several minutes to several hours will normally suffice. The nitro compound of formula LVII thus obtained may then be converted to the desired compound of formula XXX by following steps A3 and A4 as described in Method A. At some stage in the course of this, the protected carbonyl group at the 4 position of the chroman system is deprotected and this may be carried out as described hereafter in step E7. In this step, the protected carbonyl group is deprotected. Any conventional reaction employed to deprotect a protected carbonyl group may be employed in this step.

The compounds prepared as described in steps E5 and E6 are first, if necessary, deprotected, to remove the protecting group R³⁰ at the 6 position. The resulting free hydroxy group is then acylated. The resulting compound then has its carbonyl group protected, as described in step E2, to give a compound of formula LXIII or LXV . These compounds are then hydrogenated, to give the corresponding compounds of formulae LXIV or LXVI , as shown below In the above formulae, R¹ R⁵ and Ar are as defined above The hydrogenation is preferably effected in the presence of a catalyst, preferably a nickel catalyst, such as Raney nickel.

Individual isomers may be prepared by stereospecific synthesis techniques or by separation of mixtures of isomers. Alternatively, the mixtures of isomers may be employed as such. We have found that the α halocarboxylic acid derivatives of formula II have the ability to lower the levels of blood lipid peroxides, blood triglycerides and blood cholesterol, indicating that, in addition to their use as intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of the invention, they may also have in themselves therapeutic value in the treatment of hyperlipemia.
