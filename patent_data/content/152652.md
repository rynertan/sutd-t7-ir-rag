## Description
CATALYST ACTIVATION The invention relates to a process for the activation of a catalyst which is to be used for the conversion of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into hydrocarbons. The preparation of hydrocarbons from a H2 CO mixture by contacting this mixture at elevated temperature and pressure with a catalvst is known in the literature as the Fischer Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis. Catalysts often used for the purpose comprise one or more metals from the iron group, together with one or more promotors, and a carrier material. These catalysts can suitably be prepared by the known techniques, such as precipitation, impregnation, kneading and melting. The products which can be prepared by using these catalysts usually have a very wide range of molecular weight distribution and, in addition to branched and unbranched paraffins, often contain considerable amounts of olefins and oxygen containing organic compounds. Usually only a minor portion of the products obtained is made up of middle distillates.Of these middle distillates not only the yield but also the pour point is unsatisfactory. Therefore the direct conversion of H2 CO mixtures according to Fischer Tropsch is not a very attractive route for the production of middle distillates on a technical scale. In this patent anplication middle distillates should be taken to be hydrocarbon mixtures whose boiling range corresponds substantially with that of the kerosine and gas oil fractions obtained in the conventional atmospheric distillation of crude mineral oil. The middle distillation range lies substantially between about 150 and 3600C. Recently a class of Fischer Tropsch catalysts was found which have the property of yielding a product in which only very minor amounts of olefins and oxygen containin compounds occur and which consists virtuallv completely of unbranched paraffins, a considerable portion of which Daraffins boils above the middle distillate range. It has been found that the high boiling part of this product can be converted in high yield into middle distillates by hydrocracking. As feed for the hydrocracking at least the part of the product is chosen whose initial boiling point lies above the final boiling point of the heaviest middle distillate desired as end product.The hydrocracking, which is characterized bv a very low hydrogen consumption, leads to middle distillates with a considerably better pour point than those obtained in the direct conversion of a H2 CO mixture according to Fischer Tropsch. The Fischer Tropsch catalysts belonging to the above mentioned class contain silica, alumina or silica alumina as carrier material and cobalt together with zirconium, titanium and or chromium as catalytically active metals, in such quantities that the catalysts comprise 3 60 pbw of cobalt and 0.1 100 pbw of zirconium, titanium and or chromium per 100 pbw of carrier material. The catalysts are prepared by depositing the metals involved on the carrier material by kneading and or impregnation. For further information on the preparation of these catalysts by kneading and or impregnation reference may be made to Netherlands patent application No. 8301922 recently filed in the name of the Applicant. Preparatory of being eligible for use in the preparation of hydrocarbons from a H2,CO mixture the cobalt catalysts should be activated This activation may suitable be carried out bv contacting the catalyst at a temperature between 200 and 3530C with hydrogen or a hydrogen containing gas. Further investigation into the activation and performance of the afore mentioned cobalt catalysts has now shown that where stability is concerned, their performance is to a great extent dependent on the space velocity of the hydrogen containing gas, the hydrogen partial pressure and overall pressure used during the activation as well as on the surface area, the cobalt load and the zirconium load of the catalvst to be activated. It has been found that where their stability is concerned, the catalysts show optimum performance when the activation is carried out under such conditions as to satisfy the relation D 10 x S , wherein 104 x PH2 2 x Zoot L x Z 1 D space velocitv, expressed as Nl.l 1.h 1,PH2 hydrogen partial pressure, as bar,PTot overall pressure, as bar,S surface area of the catalyst, as m2 ml, L cobalt load of the catalyst as mg Co ml, andZ zirconium load of the catalyst as mg Zr 100 mg carrier. The present patent application therefore relates to a process for the activation of a catalyst, in which a catalyst comprising 3 60 pbw of cobalt and 0.1 100 pbw of at least one other metal chosen from the group formed by zirconium, titanium and chromium per 100 pbw of silica, alumina or silica alumina, which catalyst has been prepared by kneading and or impregnation, is contacted at a temperature between 200 and 3500C with hydrogen or a hydrogen containing gas under such conditions as to satisfy the afore mentioned relation. The process of the invention is preferably applied to the cobalt catalysts which form the subject matter of Netherlands patent application No. 8301922. They are catalysts which satisfy the relation 3 4 R L 0.3 0.4 R , wherein SL the total quantity of cobalt present on the catalyst, expressed as mg Co ml catalyst,S the surface area of the catalyst, expressed as m2 ml catalyst, andR the weight ratio of the quantity of cobalt deposited on the catalyst by kneading to the total quantity of cobalt present on the catalyst. Further the process of the invention is preferably applied to cobalt catalysts which have been prepared bv one of the three procedures mentioned hereinafter a first cobalt is deposited in one or more steps by impregnation and subseauently the other metal is deposited in one or more steps, also by impregnation, b first the other metal is deposited in one or more steps bv impregnation and subsequently the cobalt is deposited in one or more steps, also by impregnation, and c first cobalt is deposited in one or more steps by kneading and subsequently the other metal is deposited in one or more steps bv impregnation. Further the process according to the invention is preferably applied to cobalt catalysts containing 15 50 pbw of cobalt per 100 pbw of carrier. The preferred quantity of other metal present in the cobalt catalysts depends on the way in which this metal has been deposited. In the case of catalysts where first cobalt has been deposited on the carrier, followed by the other metal, preference is given to catalysts containing 0.1 5 pbw of the other metal per 100 pbw of carrier. In the case of catalysts where first the other metal has been deposited on the carrier, followed by the cobalt, preference is given to catalysts containing 5 40 pbw of the other metal per 100 pbw of carrier. Preference is given te zirconium as the other metal and to silica as carrier material. The catalysts activated according to the process of the n vention are excellently suitable for use in the preparation of hydrocar ns from a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The present patent application therefore also relates to a process for the preparation of hydrocarbons from a H2 and CO containing feed by using a catalyst which has been activated according to the invention. The conversion of the H2 and C0 containing feed into hydrocarbons is preferably carried out at a temperature of 1253500C and in particular of 175 2750C and a pressure of 5 100 bar and in particular of 10 75 bar. H2 and CO containing feeds which are eligible to be converted into hydrocarbons by using a catalyst activated according to the invention mav very suitably be obtained from light hdrocar bons, such as natural gas, by steam reforming or partial oxidation. Suitable H2 and CO containing feeds may also be obtained by separating a fraction containing unconverted hydrogen and carbon monoxide and other components, if desired, from the reaction product obtained by contacting a H2 CO mixture with a catalyst containing one or more metal components having catalytic activity for the conversion of a H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing organic compounds. The H2 and CO containing feed which is converted into hydrocarbons by using a catalyst activated according to the invention preferably has a H2 CO molar ratio higher than 1.5. If the feed has a H2 CO molar ratio lower than 1.5, the latter is preferably raised to a value between 1.5 and 2.5 and in particular a value between 1.75 and 2.25 before it is contacted with the cobalt catalyst. The H2 CO molar ratio of low hydrogen feeds may be raised, for instance, by adding hydrogen, removing carbon monoxide, mixing with a hydrogen rich H2 CO mixture, or subjecting the low hydrogen feed to the CO shift reaction. The cobalt catalysts which have been activated according to the invention are very suitable for use in a process for the preparation of hydrocarbons containing at least five carbon atoms per molecule hereinafter referred to as cos hydrocarbons from hydrocarbons containing at most four carbon atoms per molecule hereinafter referred to as C4 hydrocarbons , in which C4 hydrocarbons are converted in the first step bv steam reforming or partial oxidation into a H2 CO mixture, which mixture is sub sequentlv converted in a second sten into a mixture of hydrocarbons substantially consisting of C5 hydrocarbons bv contacting it at elevated temperature and pressure with a cobalt catalyst activated according to the invention, in which the feed for the second stes contains nitrogen and or carbon dioxide as contaminants, which contaminants are found in said feed substantially because the feed for the first step contained more than 20 Mv of nitrogen and or carbon dioxide and or because the first step was carried out by partial oxidation by using an oxygen containing gas mixture containing more than 50 v of nitrogen. Further the cobalt catalysts which have been activated according to the invention are very suitable for use in the preparation of C5 hydrocarbons from C4 hydrocarbons, in which C4 hydrocarbons are converted in the first step by steam reforming into a H2 CO mixture, which mixture is subsequently converted in a second step into a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting substantially of C5 hydrocarbons by contacting it at elevated temperature and pressure with a cobalt catalyst activated according to the invention, in which the reaction product of the second step is divided into a gaseous fraction substantially consisting of unconverted hydrogen and carbon monoxide, C4 hydrocarbons formed as by product and carbon dioxide formed as by product, and a liquid fraction substantially consisting of C5 hydrocarbons and water at least part of which has been formed as by product in the second step, in which the gaseous fraction is recycled to the first step and in which the excess hydrogen formed as well as the part of the steam added during the steam reforming which has remained unconverted are separated off during the process. Finally the cobalt catalysts which have been activated according to the invention are very suitable for use in the preparation of Cg hydrocarbons from C4 hydrocarbons, in which C4 hydrocarbons are converted in the first step bv steam reforming into a H2 CO mixture, which mixture is subsequently converted in a second step into a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting substantially of C9 hydrocarbons bv contacting it at elevated temperature and pressure with a cobalt catalvst activated according to the invention, in which the reaction product of the second step is divided into a gaseous fraction consisting substantially of unconverted hydrogen and carbon monoxide, C8 hydrocarbons formed as by product and steam which has remained unconverted during the steam reforming as well as steam formed as by product in the second step, and a liquid fraction consisting substantially of Cg hydrocarbons, in which the gaseous fraction is recycled to the first step and in which the excess hydrogen formed in separated off during the process. The three two step processes described hereinbefore are preferably applied to a feed in which the C4 hydrocarbons consist substantially of methane. Special preference is given to natural gas as feed. As already observed hereinbefore, the present cobalt catalysts when used for the conversion of a H2 and CO containing feed yield a substantially waxy product the high boiling part of which can be converted in high yield into middle distillates by the use of hydrocracking. As feed for the hydrocracking at least the part of the product is chosen whose initial boiling point lies above the final boiling point of the heaviest middle distillate desired as end product.Although in the preparation of middle distillates from the product obtained over the cobalt catalyst the part of the product whose initial boiling point lies above the final boiling point of the heaviest middle distillate desired as end product will do as feed for the hydrocracking, it is preferred to use for this purpose the total C5 fraction of the product prepared over the cobalt catalyst, since it has been found that the catalytic hydrotreatment leads to enhanced quality of the gasoline, kerosine and gas oil fractions present therein. The hydrocracking is carried out by contacting the fraction to be treated at elevated temperature and pressure and in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst comprising one or more noble metals from Group VIII supported on a carrier. The hydrocracking catalyst used by preference is a catalyst containing 0.1 2 w and in particular 0.2 1 w of one or more noble metals from Group VIII supported on a carrier. Preference is given to catalysts comprising platinum or palladium as Group VIII noble metal and silica alumina as carrier. The hydroerackinz is preferably carried out at a temperature of 200 4000C and in particular of 250 3500C and a pressure of 5 100 bar and in particular of 10 75 bar. If the hydrocarbon synthesis carried out over the cobalt catalyst activated according to the invention is followed by a hydrocracking treatment for the preparation of middle distillates, the two steps can be carried out in series flow , since the reaction product prepared over the cobalt catalyst will contain sufficient unconverted hydrogen for carrying out the hydrocracking. It is a matter of common knowledge that carving out a multi step process in series flow comprises using the total reaction product without any components being removed therefrom or added thereto of a certain step as feed for the following step, which is carried out substantially at the same pressure as the Dreceding step. The invention is now illustrated with the aid of the following example.EXAMPLECatalyst preparation Eight Co Zr SiO2 catalysts Catalysts 1 8 were prepared by impregnation and or kneading of silica carriers using solutions of cobalt and zirconium compounds. In each impregnation step the quantity of solution used had a volume which corresponded substantially with the pore volume of the carrier concerned. After each impregnation step the solvent was removed by heating and the material was calcined at 5000C. When a kneading step was used, the quantity of solution used has a volume which corresponded substantially with 150 of the pore volume of the carrier concerned. When a kneading step was used, the mixture was kneaded for three hours in a kneading machine. During the kneading a small portion of the solvent was removed by heating.After the kneading step the paste obtained was removed from the kneading machine, the remainder of the solvent was removed by heating and the material was ground and calcined at 5000C. Catalysts 1 8 were prepared as follows. Catalyst 1 Kneading of a silica carrier with a solution of cobalt nitrate in water, followed by single step impregnation of the cobaltloaded carrier with a solution of zirconyl chloride in water.Catalyst 2 Single step impregnation of a silica carrier with a solution of cobalt nitrate, followed by single step impregnation of the cobalt loaded carrier with a solution of zirconium nitrate in water.Catalyst 3 Single step co impregnation of a silica carrier with a solution of cobalt nitrate and zirconyl chloride in water.Catalysts 4 8 Three step impregnation of a silica carrier with a solution of zirconium tetra n propoxide in a mixture of n propanol and benzene, followed by single step impregnation of the zirconiumloaded carrier with a solution of cobalt nitrate in water.Catalysts 5 7 Two step impregnation of a silica carrier with a solution of zirconium tetra n propoxide in a mixture of n propanol and benzene, followed by single step impregnation of the zirconium loaded carrier with a solution of cobalt nitrate in water. Further information on Catalysts 1 8 is given in Table I.Catalyst activation 19 Activation experiments 1 19 were carried out in which treatment with hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen was used to prepare starting from Catalysts 1 8, the activated Catalysts 1A 1F, 2A and 2B, 3A, 4A and 4B, 5A and 5B, 6A and 6B, 7A and 7B and 8A and 8B, respectively. The conditions used to carry out the activation experiments are given in Tables II and III.Catalyst trial The activated catalysts 1A to 8B were used in nineteen experiments I XIX in the preparation of hydrocarbons from a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen of a H2 CO molar ratio of 2. The experiments were carried out in a reactor containing a fixed catalyst bed. The conditions used to carry out these experiments and the results of these experiments are given in Tables IV ar,d V.
