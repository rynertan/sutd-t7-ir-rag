# APPARATUS FOR MONITORING CHEMICAL REACTIONS

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 for monitoring chemical reactions occur ring on a slide, cartridge or other reflective carrier 22 in which the nature of the reaction is determined quantitatively by means of a change in color. The reaction products are illumina ted by radiant energy of a known wavelength and the reaction is detected and or monitored by the reflection of the radiant energy from the sample where the reaction is occurring. A plu rality of samples carried on such slides 22 is disposed in alignment in a circle or a line and a rotor 54 or carriage 154 carrying plural photometers 90 or a single photometer 166 producing plural beams at different wavelengths is moved rela tive to the samples, the beams being directed at the samples. Each sample is scanned at least once as the carriage 154 moves or the rotor 54 rotates and the reflected radiant ener gy is captured by photo responsive devices 98 and channel ed to a computer where the data is processed and information acquired concerning the respective samples with regard to end points and kinetic characteristics of their reactions.
