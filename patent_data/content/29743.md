# Method of and apparatus for enabling output power of solar panel to be maximised.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling the power sup plied by a photovoltaic solar panel 11 to a load 24, panel 11 having a family of curves for voltage versus current output parameters, the open circuit voltage of each curve increas ing as the incident solar energy on panel 11 increases for a predetermined temperature, each curve having a maximum power point and slopes with absolute values greater than one and less than unity for currents respectively greater than and less than the maximum power point. The method in cludes responding to one of the parameters from panel 11 to indicate whether the absolute value of the slope of the curve is greater or less than unity. The load is adjusted to decrease the current from the panel if the parameter indicates the slope absolute value is greater than one, and to increase the current if the value is less than unity.
