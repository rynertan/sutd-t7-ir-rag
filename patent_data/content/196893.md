# TEMPERATURE COMPENSATED ACTIVE RESISTOR

## Abstract
A temperature compensated active resistor for use on an integrated circuit semiconductor chip is formed of a N channel MOS transistor, a string of first, second and third transistors connected as a series of diodes, and a P channel MOS transistor. The P channel MOS transistor has its drain electrode connected to an output terminal in which a resistance value at the output terminal remains substantially constant over a relatively wide temperature range.
