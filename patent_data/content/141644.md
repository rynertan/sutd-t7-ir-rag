# SOFT CANINE BISCUIT CONTAINING DISCRETE MEAT AND OR MEAT BY PRODUCT PARTICLES AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
A dry soft canine biscuit having visually apparent, dis crete particles, which contain i meat and or meat by pro duct and optionally ii farinaceous material and or textured vegetable protein, distributed substantially uniformly throughout the biscuit. The dog biscuit is obtained by blend ing the non fat solids portion of a soft biscuit dough with par ticles which are substantially inert with respect to the biscuit dough, mixing the dry blended mixture with water plus op tional humectant to form an intermediate stage dough, ad mixing the latter with the fat portion of the biscuit dough to form a final dough, forming the final dough using low shear into pieces, and baking and drying the formed pieces to ob tain a microbiologically stable product which can be packaged without a barrier material. The particle inertness is made possible by using particles having 1 a moisture content of 35 percent by weight or less and 2 a water acti vity which is less than the water activity of the soft biscuit dough. There is a substantial absence of particle color bleed into the biscuit. An example of the textured vegetable protein is textured soy protein and an example of the fari naceous material is wheat. The discrete, visually apparent dehydrated meat particles enhance the palatability and vi sual attractiveness of the dry biscuit.
