# Plural dosage automatic injector with improved safety.

## Abstract
A plural dosage automatic injector 10 comprising an elongated tubular housing assembly 12 having side by side first and second medicament injecting assemblies 14 and 18 each including a container 48 and 116 , a hypoder mic needle 56 and 130 , a liquid medicament 54 and 128 and a plunger 50 and 126 within the forward end portion thereof and, first and second stressed spring assemblies 16 and 20 in the rearward end portion thereof disposed in operative relation with said first and second medicament in jecting assemblies for operating the latter. A manually operable safety device 22 is provided which includes a first safety pin 24 operable 1 when in a safety position with respect to the first spring stressed assembly to prevent actuation and release thereof and 2 when removed from its safety position to permit the actuation and release of the second stressed spring assembly. A mechanical motion transmitting mechanism 28 is provided which is operable to transmit a movement occurring as a result of the actu ation and release of the first stressed spring assembly into a secondary actuating movement operable to 1 effect a relative movement between the automatic safety pin and the second stressed spring assembly sufficient to remove the automatic safety pin from its safety position and 2 thereafter actuate and release second stressed spring as sembly to operate the second medicament injecting as sembly.
