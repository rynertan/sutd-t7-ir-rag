# Transesterification process for preparation of linear polyesters.

## Abstract
The invention provides a transesterification process for the preparation of linear aromatic polyesters comprising bisphenol and dicarboxylic acid monomer residues in which terminal groups of the polyester chain comprise carboxylic acid ester groups derived from a long chain aliphatic monofunctional alcohol. If the polyesters are prepared by a transesterification polymerization reaction using a mixture of a diaryl ester of the dicarboxylic acid, a bisphenol and the alcohol there can be a substantial loss of the alcohol by entrainment with aromatic alcohol evolved during the reaction. The invention provides a process wherein losses of alcohol by entrainment are minimized by partially transesterifying the diaryl ester of the dicarboxylic acid with the alcohol before carrying out the transesterification polymerization reaction.
