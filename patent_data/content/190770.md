## Description
.Fermentation to D Lactic Actd The invention relates to a process for producingD lactic acid with a high optical purity by fermentation.In particular, the process is continuously carried out by use of the fermentation broth of D lactic acid as a seed culture in a subsequent fermentation. In addition, the invention provides an improvement also in the batchwise fermentation process of D lactic acid.Statement of Prior Arts It is known in Japanese patent publications A unexamined Nos. 58 16688 and 58 36394 that D lactic acid is produced with lactic acid bacteria. U.S. patentNo. 3,262,862 teaches use of lactic acid bacteria for fermentation of D lactic acid. It is noted that all conventional processes are conducted batchwise so that a prepropagation accompanied by troublesome procedures such that a preserved lactic acid bacterium is allowed to grow while successively increasing the amount of the culturing broth should be carried out at each batch. In order to efficiently produce D lactic acid, a continuous culture of the fermentation has been attempted. However this process has not so far been applied in an industrial scale, since it is not possible to prevent infectious microbes for a prolonged period at present. Thus the production of D lactic acid has been exclusively carried 9ut batchwise. Since no process for preventing infectious microbes for a prolonged period in continuous fermentation ofD lactic acid has been established as yet, semicontinuous fermentation was attempted by repeating batch fermentation. As a result, it was found that were repetition of batch fermentation caused reduction in the optical purity of the product, i.e. D lactic acid. As a result of our studies to overcome these problems, we have found a process by which hi optical purity D lactic acid can be produced by repeating batch fermentation, thus completing the present invention. Summary of the Invention The invention provides a process for producingD lactic acid, which comprises the step of conducting fermention of D lactic acid.in a D lactic acidproducing medium containing therein a carbohydrate, an inorganic salt, a growth promotor and a neutralizing agent, by using as a seed culture a part of a broth obtained in a previous fermentation step of D lactic acid in which a D lactic acid producing bacterium already grown in a pre propagation is used and elevating a concentration of said growth promotor to such an effect that an optical purity of the D lactic acid may be prevented from decreasing. It is preferred that the neutralizing agent is sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or ammonia.It is a preferred embodiment of the invention that in the process air is introduced into the medium without use of said broth and the elevation of a concentration of the growth promotor. According to the invention, D lactic acid is produced by 1 first growing a D lactic acid producing bacterium by a pre proparation step, 2 cultivating D lactic acid with said bacterium in a culture medium which comprises a carbohydrate, an inorganic salt, a growth promotor and a neutralizing agent and 3 conducting further fermentation of D lactic acid in a culture medium which comprises a carbohydrate, an inorganic salt, a growth promotor and a neutralizing agent, using as a seed culture a part of the broth obtained in the previous cultivation step and elevating a concentration of said growth promotor to such an effect that a optical purity of the D lactic acid may be prevented from decreasing. In other words, the invention provides a process for producingD lactic acid wherein a D lactic acid producing bacterium previously grown by a prepropagation is cultured in a rrrediun comprising carbohydrates, inorgaic salts, goth prarotor s and neutralizing agent sj and part of the broth thus obtained is employed as a seed culture in the subsequentD lactic acid fermentation, characterized by elevating the concentration of the growth promotor s to an extent capable of inhibiting a decrease in the optical purity of D lactic acid. The invention provides an improvement in the process in which a part of the broth obtained in the previous fermentation of D lactic acid is used as a seed ,culture.That is, the process is improved by introducing air into the cultivation medium or using a specified neutralizing agent selected from sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and ammonia. This improvement is effective in the batch method of the process as well.This improved batch method can be conducted effectively without the elevation of a concentration of the growthpromotor. In the practical point of view, the batchwise process according to the invention is preferably carried out as illustrated below. 1 D lactic acid is produced by culturing a Dlactic acid producing bacterium belonging to the genusSporolactobacillus in a D lactic acid producing medium comprising a carbóhydrate, an inorganic acid, a growthpromotor and a neutralizing agent and introducing air into the medium. 2 D laçtic acid is produced by culturing a Dlactic acid producing bacterium belonging to the genusSporolactobacillus in a D lactic acid producing medium comprising a carbohydrate, an inorganic salt, a growthpromotor and a neutralizing agent selected from sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate and ammonia. The above shown process provides production of Dlactic acid with a high optical purity when it is repeated batchwise. Microorganism to be Used Any D lactic acid producing bacterium may be used in the present invention. For example, sporolactobacillus inulinus ATCC 15538, Lactobacillus delbrueckii L. leichmannii JCM 1016, L leichmannii JCM 1557 or L.lactis DSM 20073 may be used.Culture Method A seed culture of a D lactic acid producing bacterium is prepared in a conventional manner of batch fermentation. That is, the D lactic acid producing bacterium is cultured in, for example, a GYP medium as shown in Table 1. When the bacterium sufficiently grows, the culturing broth is successively increased at a rate of 10 to 1000 times to thereby prepare the seed culture. Then the seed culture thus obtained is allowed to produce D lactic acid in aD lactic acid producing medium. A composition of the medium should depend on a lactic acid producing bacterium to use in the process. It is prepared from a carbohydrate, an inorganic salt, a growth promotor and a neutralizing agent. The carbohydrate preferably includes a sugar or saccharide such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, inulin, maltose, mannose, raffinose, trehalose and a substance containing therein any saccharide, for instance a starch hydrolyzate and molasses.The inorganic salt preferably includes magnesium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, potassium phosphate and ferrous sulfate. The growth promotor preferably includes yeast extract, peptone, meat extract and soybean powder. Bach ingredient may be used with another in combination, The growth promotor is used since a lactic acidrproducing bacterium generally exhibits high auxotrophy. It is further necessary to add neutralizing agent s thereto to thereby adjust the medium in a pH range of 4.5 to 7.0, since lactic acid producing bacteria are acid sensitive.The neutralizing agent preferably includes CaCO3, CatOH 2, NaOH, Na2CO3,, NaHCO3, KOH and ammonia The fermentation process of the invention is normally conducted in the anaerobic condition, for instance by passing an inert gas, such as nitrogen gas into the system.It is added, however, that air may be used in the above shown embodiment using air, without any inert gas. A fermentation temperature depends on the lactic acid producing bacterium to be used. For example, it is preferable to carry out the fermentation at 370C whenSporolactobacillus inulinus ATCC 15538 is employed, whileL. delbruëckii IFO 3534 is preferably cultured at 45 to 50 C. Upon completion of the first D lactic acid fermentation in this manner, part of the obtained broth is used as a seed culture in the subsequent D lactic acid fermentation.The D lactic acid obtained from the second fermentation in a medium of the same composition as that used in the first fermentation shows a lowered optical purity. Iwever this problem can be solved by elevating the concentration of growth promotor s . The concentration of growth promotors in a medium used in a process of repeated fermentation is higher by generally 20 or mores preferably 50 or more, than the initial concentration.Alternately other growth promotor s may be added thereto.The amourit of the growth promotor s to be added depends on the bacterium to be used. Generally 0.1 or more, preferbly 0.5 or more, of the growth promotor s should be added. Table 1 GYP medium glucose 20 g l yeast extract 10 g l peptone 10 g l sodium acetate 10 g l magnesium sulfate 0.2 g l FeSO4 7H20 10 mg l MnSO4 4.5H2O 10 mg l NdC1 10 mg l However it is also possible to prevent the D lactic acid purity from falling by supplying air to the fermentation medium even in the case where CaCO3 is used as a neutralizing agent without elevating the concentration of the growth prom6tor s . It is preferable to supply air to the medium at a rate of less thÅan 10 by volume per min hereinafter referred to as 0.1 V.V.M. based on the amount of the liquid medium.It is undesirable that the rate exceeds 0.1 V.V.M., since the growth of the lactic acid producing bacterium is completly inhibited thereby. The term air as used herein refers to one containing 21 by volume of oxygen. As a matter of course, the maximum amount of the air supply is restricted depending on the concentration of oxygen in the air. The use of this process makes it possible to produce high optical purity D lactic acid by the use of any neutralizing agent s without using a large amount of expensive growth prornotor s BoNer it is also possible to present the optical purity of D lactic acid from falling by employing neutralizing agent s selected from among sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate and ammonia even when the fermentation is repeated in a medium of the same composition as that used in the first fermentation. This process makes it possible to effectively produce high optical purity Lactic acid without using a large amount of expensive growth promotor s . The neutralizing agent s as used herein may be in the form of an aqueous solution, a powder or a gas. It may be selected from the viewpoint of convenience in operation. D lactic acid is important as a starting material in synthesizing various optically active substances so that the demand therefor has been recently increasing. Under these circumstances, the present invention makes it possible to efficiently produce D lactic acid in an industrial scale.Preferred Embodiments of the Invention To further illustrate the present invention, the following Examples will be given.
