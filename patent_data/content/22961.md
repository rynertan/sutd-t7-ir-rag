# Play ball.

## Abstract
The invention relates to playballs, e.g. tennis balls, having a core pressurised with a low permeability gas, e.g. sulphur hexafluoride. Use of such gases can cause the ball to emit a pinging noise on bouncing. The invention provides a core 1 pressurised with gas of low permeability, the internal wall surface 3 of core 1 being profiled by a multiplicity of depressions or protuberances 4 , the outer wall surface 2 of the core being smooth. The profiling is preferably in the form of dimples or pimples of circular plan view.
