## Description
OllATERNARY AMMONItJM SALTS, AND THEIRFORMIJLATIONS, IJSE A0 PREPARATION New quaternary ammonium salts of certain phenylpropylamines and phenylbutylamines and a method of preparing them are here disclosed. They are useful compounds for treating arrhythmia and prolonging the action potential of cardiac tissue. Despite the extensive amount of research and the relatively large number of drugs devoted to the treatment of heart disease, mortality from cardiac vascular disorders remains alarmingly high. Cardiovascular deterioration is known to commence early in life and is progressive throughout. It has been said that about half the population by the age of 50 have about fifty percent occlusion of at least one coronary artery, while less than about one fifth have entirely unoccluded arteries at this age, Rissanen, Advan.Cardicl., 4, 99 1970 . The mechanism of action of various antiarrhythmic drugs generally is mediated by their effects upon the electrophysiological properties of cardiac muscle and conducting tissue. The electrical potential difference present in a heart muscle is created by ionic concentration differences across the membrane of the cardiac cell the cardiac membrane being selectively permeable to different ionic species which pass through pores or channels. When the cardiac muscle is at rest, its interior is negatively charged due to a high intraceliular concentration of non diffusable large anions. During the action potential, the interior becomes positively charged relative to the exterior due to the sudden increase in sodium permeability resulting in the influx of positive charges.Then, until repolarization of the tissue takes place, the membranes are totally refractory to the passage of further sodium ions. The refractory period is quite long since repolarization is about 100 times slower than depolarization. Any drug which shortens the duration of the cardiac action potential thus necessarily shortens the refractory period and consequently increases the possibility of re entrant rhythms under certain abnormal conditions. The refractory period would of course be prolonged if repolarization were delayed. Various drugs have been used in the treatment of rhythm disorders. Quinidine, procaine amide, and lidocaine are perhaps among the best known and most widely used agents. All of such drugs act primarily by directly affecting membrane conductance so as to increase or decrease various ionic flows. A number of quaternary ammonium salts recently have been found useful in treating arrhythmia. Among such salts is a drug called bretylium see U.S. Patent No. 3,038,004 .Bretylium is a salt of o bromobenzyl ethyldimethyl ammonium cation. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of disturbances of ventricular rhythm which are not successfully treated by other more conventional drugs, see Morgan et al., J. Pharm.Sci., 65, 467 1976 . Unfortunately, it possesses many adverse side effects including sympathomimetic and sympathomlytic effects. Several investigators recently have been interested in developing quaternary ammonium compounds which are useful antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory drugs which at the same time cause no adverse effects on the antonomic nervous system see particularlyLucchesi et al., Pharmacological Modification ofArrhythmias After Experimentally Induced Acute MyocardialInfarction American Heart Association Monograph No.47, December, 1975 . The dimethyl quaternary ammonium salt of propranolol has demonstrated useful antiarrhythmic activity ayainst a variety of experimentally induced cardiac arrhythmias, Schuster et al., J.Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 184, 213 1973 and Kniffen et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 187, 260 1973 . This invention provides certain phenylbutyl ammonium salts and phenylpropyl ammonium salts which are extremely potent in prolonging cardiac action potential duration. The compounds are thus useful for prolonging the refractory period in cardiac muscle and conducting tissue and thereby are useful in decreasing the vulnerability of the heart to re entrant arrhythmias. This invention relates to specific and potent antiarrhythmic drugs which are useful in preventing ventricular fibrillation and other reentrant arrhythmias by selectively prolonging the action potential, and consequently the refractoriness, of cardiac tissue. The invention additionally is directed to a method of prolonging the action potential of cardiac tissue and thus preventing and treating ventricular fibrillation and related re entrant arrhythmias. The invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations useful in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. The decrease in the rate of rise of the action potential caused by many of the commonly used cardiovascular drugs results in conduction depression in the intact heart. This action, in conjunction with the shortened refractory period, may predispose the heart to a variety of re entrant arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and flutter, the most serious forms of arrhythmia. The compounds of this invention are particularly potent in prolonging both the action potential and refractory period of cardiac tissue. Moreover, they are selective in their activity in that they cause no inhibition of the rate of rise of the action potential at concentrations that prolong refractoriness. The compounds of this invention therefore are useful in the treatment and prevention of a variety of arrhythmias which have as their basis single or multiple re entrant rhythms. The compounds typically will be used in the treatment of arrhythmias such as ventricular flutter, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular pre excitation, atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia. This invention provides a quaternary ammonium salt of phenyl alkylamine having the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein n is 1 or 2 R1 is hydrogen or C1 C2 R2 is hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl R3 is C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl R4 is C1 C8 alkyl 4 5 R5 is C1 C10 alkyl, or R4 and R5 taken together with the adjacent nitrogen to which they are attached complete a heterocyclic ring having 4 to 7 carbon atoms R6 and R7 independently are hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, nitro, C1 C3 alkoxy, or C1 C3 alkyl, provided that at least one of R6 and R7 is hydrogen, and further provided that when n is 1 and R6 and R7 independently are other than nitro, R5 is C6 C10 alkyl and X is a therapeutically acceptable anion. This invention also provides a process for preparing a quaternary ammonium salt of phenyl alkylamine having the general formulaEMI6.1 wherein n is 1 or 2 R1 is hydrogen or C1 C2 alkyl R is hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl R3 is C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl R4 is C1 C8 alkyl R5 is C1 C10 alkyl, or Rw and R5 taken together with the adjacent nitrogen to which they are attached complete a heterocyclic ring having 4 to 7 carbon atoms R6 and R7 independently are hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, nitro, C1 C3 alkoxy, or C c alkyl, pro 6 17 3 vided that at least one of R6 and R is hydrogen, and further provided that when n is 1 and R6 and R7 independently are other than nitro, R5 is C6 C10 alkyl and X is a therapeutically acceptable anion which comprises reacting the tertiaryamine NR8R9R10 wherein R8 Rg and R10 togeti 3, R4, R5 and Rill, R11 being ier are selected fromEMI7.1 each of R3, R4, R5 and R11 used no more than once with R12 Y wherein R12 is the R3, R4, R5 or R11 not above selected and Y is X or another leaving group and when Y is a leaving group other than X replacing the leaving group by X. This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition useful in the treatment of re entrant arrhythmias in humans which comprises at least one quaternary ammonium salt of phenylalkylamine of formula I as before described and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers. In the above formula R1 represents hydrogen or aC1 C2 alkyl group, namely methyl and ethyl. R2 represents hydrogen as well as C1 C3 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and n propyl. R3 defines aC1 C4 alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl and isopropyl and a phenyl C1 C4 alkyl group such as phenylmethyl, phenethyl, 3 phenylpropyl, 4 phenylbutyl and phenylisopropyl. R4 defines aC1 C8 alkyl group. Such term includes groups such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, isopentyl, 2methylbutyl, 2 methylpentyl, l ethylpentyl, nheptyl, n octyl, isooctyl, and the like.Similarly,R represents Cl Clo alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n pentyl, isohexyl, 2 ethylheptyl, n heptyl, 3 methylheptyl, 1,2 dimethylheptyl, 1,2 dimethyloctyl, l,l dimethylheptyl, n nonyl, n decyl, and related alkyl groups and when n is 1 and R6 and R7 are other than nitro, R5 is C6 C10. 4 5 In addition to R and R each defining an alkyl group, R4 and R5 can be taken together with the adjacent nitrogen to which they are attached to complete a heterocyclic ring containing from A to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of such ring systems include pyrrolidine, piperidine, hexahydroazepine and octahydroazocine. As noted hereinabove, R6 and R7 are selected from hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, C1 C3 alkoxy, nitro, and C1 C3 alkyl. Typical haloyen groups are fluorine, chlorine and bromine. Examples of C1 C3 alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy and isopropoxy. C1 C3 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, and npropyl. The compounds of this invention are quaternary ammonium salts and as such require an anion, defined in the above formula by X. Any suitable anion which goes together with the ammonium cation to form a therapeutically acceptable salt can be utilized. Commonly used anions include chloride, bromide, Fulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, p obromophenylsulfonate, phosphate, carbonate, oxalate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, acetate, and the like.A preferred and commonly used anion is bromide. The phenylpropylammonium salts and phenylbutylammonium salts of this invention can be prepared by any of a number of art recognized chemical processes.Generally, an N,N dialkyl 3 phenylpropylamine orN,N dialkyl 4 phenylbutylamine will simply be reacted with about an equimolar quantity or an excess of an alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide, alkyl sulfate, alkyl tosylate, or the like. More particularly, a disubstituted propyl or butylamine of the formulaEMI9.1 can be reacted with an alkylating agent of the formulaR5 X in a solvent such as diethyl ether. The quaternary ammonium salts prepared by any of the methods discussed herein characteristically exist as highly crystalline white solids. Generally, when a tertiary amine and an alkylating agent are reacted as described above, the product salt precipitates out of solution and can accordingly be recovered by filtration.The salt so formed can be readily purified further if desired by conventional methods such as recrystallization, utilizing common organic solvents such as ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, benzene, and the like. An alternative method for preparing the quaternary ammonium salts of this invention comprises reacting a tertiary amine with a phenylpropyl or phenylbutyl derivative which bears a good leaving group 2 the l position. Good leaving groups are well k wn to those skilled in the art and include groups such as chloro, bromo, methanesulfonyl, p tolue esulfonyl, azide, and the like. A preparation according to this latter method comprises reacted a tertiary amine such as methyl ethyl n octy amine with about an equimolar quantity of a pheny opyl derivative such as 3 3 bromophenyl propyl chloride or a phenylbutyl derivative such as 4 4 methoxyphenyl butyl bromide.Such condensation generay is carried out in an unreactive solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene, or if preferred the reaction can be carried out neat. The condensation typicay is substantially complete within 1 to 10 days w n carried out at a temperature of about 500 to 2000C. The product, a quaternary ammonium salt, normal is crystalline and can be recovered by filtration and recrystallized if desired. A preferred group of compounds according to this invention are those phenylpropylammonium salts and phe ylbutylammonium salts wherein one of the alkyl substituents on the ammonium nitrogen atom is lower aLkyl such as methyl or ethyl. A particularly preferred method for preparing such compounds comprises simply adding the appropriate tertiary amine to a solution which is saturated with a methyl or ethyl alkylating agent such as a halide. For example, solvents such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, ethyla etate, acetonitrile and the like are readily saturated with an alkylating agent such as methyl bromide or ethyl chloride.When a tertiary amine is added to such solution, guaternization generally is effected very rapidly to produce the corresponding salt as a solid precipitate. A phenyl propyl or butyl ammonium salt wherein R6 or R7 is hydroxyl can be prepared from a phenyl propylammonium salt or phenylbutylammonium salt wherein R6 or R7 is methoxy by forming the ammonium hydroxide quaternary and treating with hydrobromic acid in the presence of glacial acetic acid. The anion associated with the quaternary ammonium cationic portion of the salts of this invention is defined in the above formula by X . It should be recognized that the particular anion forming a part of any salt of this invention is not of a critical nature, so long as the salt as a whole is pharmacologically acceptable and as long as the anionic moiety does not contribute numerous undesired qualities to the salt as a whole. The most preferred anions to be utilized are the halides, and whenever a halide such as chloride or bromide is the anion portion of the salt, it can, if desired for any reason, be replaced by a different anion.Such replacement can be effected either directly by metathesis, i.e., by double decomposition either in solution or by employing an ion exchange resin, or alternatively by conversion of the quaternary salt to the corresponding hydroxide, and then neutralization of the hydroxide by reaction with the appropriate acid. For example, a quaternary ammonium halide can be reacted with aqueous silver oxide to form the corresponding quaternary ammonium hydroxide. Reaction of the hydroxide with an acid such as methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, butyric acid, nitric acid, or the like, then provides the quaternary ammonium salt having an anion corresponding to the acid utilized. The starting materials required for the synthesis of the salts of this invention are by and large known compounds, or are readily available by known procedures. As hereinabove pointed out, a preferred procedure for preparing quaternary ammonium salts comprises reacting a tertiary amine with an alkylating agent. The required tertiary amines can be prepared by any of a number of methods. For example, a phenylpropyl halide or phenylbutyl halide can be reacted with a primary amine such as n octylamine or isopentylamine to provide the corresponding secondary amine. The secondary amine can then be reacted with an alkylating agent to give the corresponding tertiary amine.When a tertiary amine wherein one of the alkyl groups is methyl is desired, particularly convenient method of preparation comprises reacting the appropriate primary or secondary amine with formaldehyde and formic acid. Primary and secondary amines are additionally readily prepared by reduction of an appropriate phenylalkyl amide. For example, reduction of an amide such as N n heptyl 3 3nitrophenyl propionamide affords the corresponding Nn heptyl 3 3 nitrophenyl propylamine. Reaction of the latter compound with formaldehyde and formic acid affords N methyl N n heptyl 3 3 nitrophenyl propyl amine. Still another method for preparing amine starting materials is by reductive amination of ketones. For example, the starting materials needed to prepare salts having the above formula wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is C1 C3 alkyl are best prepared by a procedure which comprises reacting a primary amine, i.e., an amine of the formula R5NH2, with a phenylethyl or phenylpropyl C1 C3 alkyl ketone. For instance, a ketone such as 2 phenylethyl n propyl ketone can be reacted with isooctylamine in the presence of hydrogen and a suitable catalyst such as palladium on carbon to effect condensation and reduction to provide N isooctyl l n propyl 3 phenyipropylamine. Further alkylation and quaternization of such amine provides a compound of this invention. The following list of quaternary ammonium salts is illustrative of the compounds comprehended by this invention. N Ethyl N methyl N isopropyl 4 phenylbutyl ammonium chloride N, N Di n propyl N n octyl 3 4 isopropyl phenyl propylammonium methanesulfonate N Ethyl N n heptyl N n octyl l,l diethyl 3 3 ethoxyphenyl propylammonium fluoride N,N Di n octyl N isopropyl 4 3 f luoro phenyl butylammonium acetate N,N,N Tri n propyl l ethyl 4 phenylbutyl ammonium succinate N n Propy l N n hexyl N 3 methy lhepty 1 4 3 ethylphenyl butylammonium tartrate N,N Di n butyl N 3 ethylheptyl 1 ethyl l methyl 3 3 ethoxyphenyl propylammonium benzenesulfonate N Ethyl N isobutyl N n nonyi 4 3 nitro phenyl butylammonium fluoride N Methyl N 3 ethylpentyl N 3 methyl octyl 1, l diethyl 4 3 bromophenyl butylammonium toluenesulfonate N,N Diethyl N n heptyl 4 phenylbutylammonium iodide N Ethyl 4 phenylbutylpyrrolidinium butyrate N n Butyl 3 3 ethoxyphenyl propylpiperidinium oxalate N Ethyl 4 4 n propoxyphenyl butylhexa hydroazepinium chloride N , N Diethyl N n hexyl 3 phenylpropylammonium bromide N,N Diethyl N n decyl 3 phenylpropylammonium bromide N Ethyl 4 phenyloctahydroazocinium hydroxide N ,N Di 2 methylheptyl N n propyl l ,1 diethyl 4 3 methoxyphenyl butylammonium bromide N, N Di n propyl N n octyl l ethyl l methyl 3 4 ethoxyphenyl propylammonium fluoride N Ethyl N n octyl N n propyl l ethyl l n propyl 3 3 nitrophenyl propylammonium iodize N,N Di n pentyl N ethyl l methyl 4 3 iodophenyl butylammonium benzenesulfonate and N,N Diethyl N n heptyl 4 4 fluorophenyl butylammonium methansulfonate. It should be noted that certain of the compounds of this invention have an asymmetric center and accordingly exist as optical isomers. For example, compounds of the above formula wherein R1 and R2 are different exist as a d isomer, an 1isomer, and as the racemic mixture. Such compounds generally are utilized as a racemic mixture, however separation of such mixture into the optically active isomers can be readily accomplished if desired. Such separation is accomplished by forming a di as tereomer by reaction of an amine precursor with an optically active substrate, separating the diastereomers by routine methods such as crystallization, and then cleaving the optically active substrate.A typical resolution, for instance, comprises reacting an amine such as dl l ethyl 3 phenylpropylamine with optically active d or 1 a methylbenzyl bromide. Repeated crystallization of the product to provide the separated diastereomers, followed by de benzylation by hydrogenolysis, provides optically active d and 1 1 ethyl 3 phenylpropylamine. The latter compound can then be alkylated and quaternized by the methods hereinabove described. As already pointed out, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating and preventing re entrant arrhythmias and are particularly important due to their potent and selective ability to prolong the action potential duration of cardiac tissue. The compounds of the invention accordingly are useful in the treatment of arrhythmia by d reasimg the vulner ability of the heart to re entrant rhythms and ventricular fibrillation by prolonging the time of electrical systole. The activity of the compounds of this invention has been analyzed by utilizing standard electrophysiological techniques to measure resting potential, action potential amplitude, duration, rate of rise and effective refractory periods of normal canine Purkinje fibers superfused in vitro withRinger solution at 350C. and stimulated at 1 Hz.For example, N,N diethyl N n heptyl 4 4 chiorophenyl butylammonium bromide, at a concentration of 2 x 10 8 molar, effected a twenty percent prolongation of action potential duration in Purkinje fibers that were driven at a constant frequency of 1 Hz. Similarly, N, N dimethyl N n heptyl l methyl 4 phenylbutylammonium bromide caused a twenty five percent prolongation under the same conditions. In addition to demonstrating in vitro utility in prolonging action potential duration and refractoriness, the certain compounds comprehended by this invention also have been examined in the intact dog. In a typical experiment utilizing dogs subjected to electrically induced ventricular fibrillation, a marked decrease in the vulnerability of the heart to fibrillation was observed when doses from about 0.1 mole kg. of body weight to about 50 umole kg. were administered prior to the induction of fibrillation.The compounds of this invention also have been shown to convert flutter, ventricular fibrillation, or rapid tachycardia, experimentally established both in vitro and in vivo, to a normal sinus rate as a result of the prolongation of refractoriness. Such actions demonstrate that the compounds of this invention are useful in situations where rapid inappropriate ventricular rates are present, particularly in cases of ventricular pre excitation tachyarrhythmia. There is also provided by this invention a method for treating arrhythmia which comprises administering to a subject suffering from an arrhythmia and in need of treatment or to a subject suspected of developing an arrhythmia an effective amount for treating such arrhythmia of compound of this invention. The compounds are preferably utilized for the control of re entrant arrhythmias in humans and for the prevention of sudden death resulting from ventricular fibrillation. Accordingly it is contemplated that the compounds are best utilized in a prophylactic treatment. The compounds can be administered either orally or parenterally, and for prophylactic treatment are best formulated for convenient oral administration.The particular dose of compound administered according to this invention will of course be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular arrhythmia being treated, and similar considerations. A typical dose for prophylactic treatment, however, will contain from about 50 Vg kg. to about 500 vg kg. of the active compound of this invention when administered orally. For I.V. admin istration, the dose will be from about 20 vg kg. to about 200 vg kg. The compound to be administered can be formulated by admixing with any of a number of suitable pharmaceutical diluents and carriers such as lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose, calcium sulfate, sodium benzoate and the like. Such formulations can be compressed into tablets or can be encapsulated into gelatin capsules for convenient oral administration. A gelatin capsule suited to oral administration for prophylactic treatment of heart disease may contain, for example, a compound of this invention such as N,N diethyl N n heptyl 4 4 nitrophenyl butylammonium bromide in the amount of about 1 to about 5 mg. Such formulation can be administered orally at the rate of about 1 or 2 capsules per day or more often as needed depending upon the particular condition and patient being treated. For parenteral administration, a compound of this invention can be formulated for intramuscular or intravenous administration. In the case of treatment of a patient suffering from a severe cardiac arrhythmia, it may be desirable to administer a compound of the invention by intravenous infusion in order to effect a speedy conversion to a normal sinus rhythm. Such normal condition can then be maintained by oral administration. For parenteral administration, the compounds of this invention are formulated with any of a number of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents to constitute an injectable liquid solution. Commonl used diluents and carriers include water or saline solution, buffered aqueous solutions, as well as disp rsing and surface active agents if needed.It will also be noted that a compound of this invention can be administered in combination with other known antiarraythmic drugs which have potent anti automatic effects. Such drugs include aprindine, quinidine, proprartlol and the like. A typical formulation suited to intramuscular administration may contain a compound of this invention such as N,N di n pentyl N n prcsyl 4 phenylbutylammonium methanesulfonate in the amount of about 1.0 to 25.0 mg., with or without another antiarrhythmic drug such as quinidine in the amount of about 100 to 200 mg., and a suitable solubilizing agent and sufficient sterile water to bring the volume to about 2 ml.Such formulation can be injected at a rate of 1 to 4 times per day or more often depending upon the particular condition of the patient being treated. The present invention will now be more fully described in terms of typical working examples. yhe following discussions are to be taken as illustrative of the compounds comprehended by the invention, and are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any particular aspect.
