# Method and apparatus for registering multicolour offset printing machines.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for registering a perfecting offset printing unit to a reference perfecting offset printing unit while minimizing displacement between associ ated non print gap areas. The circumferential position of the upper printing plate 22 and the lower printing plate 30 of the unit to be registered is monitored with respect to their associated blankets. The print registration between the unit to be registered and the reference unit is monitored. Printing position changes for the upper printing couple 20 and the lower printing couple 26 of the unit to be registered that are needed to effect registration with the reference unit are determined. The upper and lower printing couples of the unit to be registered are rotated by a unit to unit phaser adjust ment assembly 36 and the upper printing plate and the lower printing plate are also rotated respectively by an upper and a lower circumferential adjustment assembly 38, 40 with respect to their associated blankets.
