# Olefin polymerization, catalyst system therefor and titanium containing component of that system.

## Abstract
A supported titanium catalyst component, suitable for use in the polymerization of alph olefins, is produced by treating a supported titanium containing solid obtained by co pulverization of a magnesium halide, a tetravalent titanium halide which may also comprise an electron donor compound and or a halogen compound with an organohalogen compound. The component is thereafter tre ated with an organoaluminum compound and an electron donor compound. The resulting supported titanium catalyst, when employed as a titanium component with an organoaluminum catalyst componet results on a catalyst system useful for the polymerization of alpha olefins.
