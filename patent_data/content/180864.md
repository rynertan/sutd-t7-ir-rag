# Preparation of fluoropyridines.

## Abstract
A process for the simultaneous preparation of 2,3 difluoro and 2,3 dichloropyridines from 3 chloro 2 fluoropyridines which comprises passing a 3 chloro 2 fluoropyridine over a carbon based catalyst, optionally in the presence of HF, at elevated temperatures, thereby forming the corresponding 2,3 dichloro and 2,3 difluoropyridines.
