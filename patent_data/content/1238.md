Hydantoin derivatives, defined hereinbelow in formula I , have been found to have pharmaco logical properties relates to those of natural prosta glandins, as demonstrated by their ability to mimic or antagonise the physiological effects of the natural prostaglanding in various biological prepara tions. In particular, certain compounds of formula CI have been found to be potent mimetics of the anti platelet aggregatory properties of prostaglandin E1. In formula I EMI2.1 Z is hydrogen or alkyl one of ZÚ and Zê is represented by the group X X1 X2 X3 wherein X is methylene, X1 is phenylene, C C , cis or trans CH CH or CH2 CQ2 in which each Q is independently selected from hydrogen and alkyl such as ethyl or the two Qls together form an alkylene radical having four, five or six carbon atoms Xê is a covalent bond or a straight or branched alkylene chain having 1 to 6 carbon atoms X3 is selected from 5 tetrazolyl, carboxyl, carboxamide, hydroxymethylene and alkoxycarbonyl and one of the methylene groups of X, X1 and x2 may be replaced by oxa 0 or thia S provided that at least one carbon atom seperates the oxa or thia group from a CC , CH CH or CO group or from the nitrogen of the hydantoin ring and the other of 71 and z2 is represented by the group wherein Y is CR2 CH2 in which each R is independently selected from hydrogen and methyl yl is carbonyl, methylene, methylene substituted by hydroxyl or methylene substituted by hydroxyl and alkyl Y2is a covalent bond or straight or branched alkylene having 1 to 7 carbon atoms optionally substituted on the carbon adjacent yl by one or two groups each of which may be alkyl or a cyclic radical Y3is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy having 1 to 7, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms, a cyclic radical, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy or benzyloxy, wherein each of phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy and benzyloxy may be substituted in the benzene ring by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, halogeno, nitro, amino, acylamino, alkenyl, alkoxy, phenyl, benzyloxy and alkyl which may itself be substituted by one or more 2 halogeno groups or Y and Y3 together form an alkyl group having 1 to 7 carbon atoms of which at least one hydrogen is replaced by fluoro or Y is a bond, CH2 , or CH2.CH2 and YÚ, Yê and Y taken together form a cycloalkyl or bicycloalkyl group substituted by a hydroxyl group which preferably has three carbon atoms seperating it from the hydantoin ring provided that X or X1 includes an oxa group or crone of X, X1 and X includes a thia group and or at least one of y2 and Y3 includes a cyclic radical other than cycloalkyl of 3 to 10 carbon atoms or bicycloalkyl of 4 to 10 carbon atoms or that Y2 and Y3 together form alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms of which at least one hydrogen is replaced by fluoro or that yl, y2 and Y3 are taken together to form a hydroxyl substituted bicycloalkyl group, and or that includes a benzene ring substituted by benzyloxy. In formula I , the term cyclic radical means the monovalent radical derived by loss of a ring hydrogen atom from a monocyclic or polyclic compound having from 3 to 12 ring atoms selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which compound may be saturated or unsaturated and may be further substituted by one or more alkyl groups, but excluding phenyl.Such cyclic radicals include cycloalkyl having 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cyclooctyl, bicycloalkyl having 4 to 10 carbon atoms such as adamantyl or norbornanyl bicyclo L2,2,l heptyl , spiroalkanyl having 5 to 12 carbon atoms such as 2 spiro 3,3 heptyl, l spiro L4,43 nonjl and 8 spiro 4,53 decs , cycloalkenyl having 4 to 10 carbon atoms such as 4 cyclo pentenZl, heterocyclic radicals such as tetrahydrofuranyl and tetrahydropyranyl and heteroaryl radicals such as thienyl, furyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl and diazapinyl. Included in the term cyclic radical are those wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluoro. Unless otherwise stated, in formula I and other formulae in this specification, alkyl moieties are selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl, including all isomers thereof for example, in the definitions of yl and Y2 the alkyl groups are preferably methyl and the alkyl moiety of alkoxycarbonyl is desirably methyl or ethyl. Similarly alkylene groups have 2 to 4 carbon atoms for example vinyl. In a compound of formula I the bonding of the divalent phenylene group may be ortho, meta or para, and the oxa or thia group is preferably adjacent the phenylene or when ss is other than phenylene then X2 may be CH2 O CH2 or CH2 S CH2 . Included in the meaning of compounds of formula I are the salts corresponding to the carboxylic acids and tetrazoles when X3 is carboxyl or tetrazolyl respectively, and the salts which may also be formed whenZ is hydrogen. Particularly valuable salts for medical purposes are those having a pharmaceutically acceptable cation such as ammonium or that of an alkali metal e.g.sodium and potassium, an alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium and magnesium, or an organic base, particularly an amine such as ethanolamine. Salts having non pharmaceutically acceptable cations are included within the ambit of this invention as useful intermediates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or the acids or esters of formula I . Except when there is clear indication to the contrary, formula I and other formulae in the specification embrace all stereoisomers represented therein. In particular such formulae include the enantiomeric forms, such mixtures as are designated racemates, and diastereoisomers. The compounds of formula I may be synthesised by any method known in the art for the synthesis of compounds of analogous structure. For example, they may be prepared from the corresponding derivatives of hydantoic acid of formula CII EMI6.1 wherein G is carboxyl or a derivative thereof such as amide or ester in particular an alkyl ester, and each of z, Z1 and z2 has the same meaning as in formula I , by cyclisation under acidic conditions or by heating alone. The reaction may be effected in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solvent may be used, for example a hydrocarbon such as petrol.Alternatively, where G is alkoxycarbonyl, cyclisation may be effected in the presence of a suitable base, for example an alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide. Compounds of formula II are conveniently prepared from an amino acid derivative of formula CIII EMI7.1 wherein G, Z1 and z2 are as defined in formula I provided that G may also be nitrile, by reaction with cyanic acid or an alkyl iso cyanate depending respectively on whether Z is hydrogen or alkyl. When cyanic acid is used, the cyanic acid is conveniently produced in situ by the use of an alkali metal cyanate, e.g. potassium cyanate, and an acid which may be present as an acid addition salt of the compound of formula III or a free acid of formula I II wherein either or both of R and X3 is hydrogen. Alternatively an equivalent amount of mineral acid or an organic acid may be added to the reaction medium. The reaction may proceed in the absence of a solvent but desirably an inert solvent is used which is preferably polar such as water or a mixture of water with acetone,dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide or a lower alkanol such as ethanol or it may beahydrocarbon, an ether or halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform.Where desired, for example if no solvent is used the reaction may be promoted by heating the reactants. Similar reaction conditions may be used when an alkyl iso cyanate is used except that it is unnecessary to provide an equivalent amount of acid as an acid addition salt or otherwise, in the reactants. Instead of using a cyanate or isocyanate, a compound of formula CIII may be reacted with urrea, nitrourea or an N a lkylurea as appropriate. A solvent is not essential but if desired an inert solvent such as one mentioned above may be used, and the reaction is preferably effected at an elevated temperature, for example from 100C to 1250C but temperatures up to 1500C may be employed. In the above described synthesis, the intermediates of formula CII need not be isolated from the reaction mixture and may be converted directly to compounds of formula CI under the described reaction conditìonst An intermediate of formula III may be conveniently prepared by reaction of a compound of formula CIV with a compound of formula CV EMI8.1 wherein G, Z1 and z2 are as defined in formula CIII , one of Q1 and Q2 is amino and the other is halogeno, preferably bromo. The reaction may be carried out by heating in tRe absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent such as ethanol. The intermediates of formula III whereinZê is Y YÚ Yê Y when YÚ is carbonyl may also be prepared by reaction of an amine of formula IV wherein Q1 is amino with an unsaturated ketone of formula VI CR2 CH.CO.Y2.Y3 VI wherein Yê and Y have the same meaning as in formula III the reaction being effected in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, and at room temperature or optionally with heating. Hydantoins of formula I may also be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula VII EMI9.1 wherein Z, Z1 and z2 are as defined in formula I and G1 is carboxyl or a reactive derivative thereof such as alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl. Compounds of formula VII may be cyclised under similar conditions as a compound of formula I T and conveniently the method used to prepare a compound of formula VII is chosen such that the prevailing reaction conditions permit spontaneous cyclisation. For example, the intermediates of formula CVI I may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VIII EMI10.1 wherein one of Q1 and Q2 is halogeno, preferably chloro or bromo and the other is amino and each of Z, 1, z2 and G1 have the same meaning as in formula VII .The reaction may be effected by admixture of the reactants or optionally an inert solvent is used and the mixture is heated. Suitable solvents include alkanols, ethers, hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. The compounds of formula CVIII may themselves be made by reacting an appropriate carbamic acid derivative, for example an alkyl ester, with a compound of formula IV , using techniques known to those skilled in the art. In a method related to those described hereinbefore, the hydantoins of formula I may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IX EMI10.2 wherein each of Z, Z1 and z2 has the same meaning as in formula CI with a carbonic acid derivative. Any carbonic acid derivative known to those skilled in the art as appropriate may be used, for example phosgene, diphenylcarbonate or an alkyl haloformate such as ethyl chloroformate. The reaction is desirably effected in the presence of a base, for example an amine such as triethylamine or di isopropyl ethylamine, and using an inert aprotic solvent such as toluene, dimethylformamide or an ether such as diethylether. The reaction may be carried out at room temperature but if desired the reaction mixture may be heated. The intermediates of formula IX may be made using methods analogous to those described above for the preparation of compounds of formula CIII . The hydantoins of formula CI wherein Z is alkyl may also be prepared by alkylation, using an alkylating agent which may be designated as a reactive ester derivative of an alcohol J3 OH, of a compound of formula CX EMI11.1 wherein J is hydrogen or alkyl, J1 is hydrogen 21, J2 is hydrogen or z2 and J3 is alkyl, Z1 or z2, provided that one of J, J1 and J2 is hydrogen and J3 does not have the same value as J, J1 or in the definition of J1, J2 and J3 each of Z1 and z2 has the same meaning as in formula I .Suitable reactive ester derivatives include chloride, bromide, iodide and sulphonates such as E toluenesulphonate, methanesulphonate and benzenesulphonate. The alkylation may be effected using reaction conditions which are known in the art to be suitable, for example in the presence of a base such as an alkalimetal hydride, alkali metal amide, or alkalimetal alkoxide, typically sodium hydride or a sodium alkoxide e.g. sodium methoxide. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent which simply acts as a diluent for the reactants such as toluene, dioxan, ether, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulphoxide or acetonitrile or when the base is an alkali metal alkoxide then the corresponding alkanol may be used. It will be appreciated that the intermediates of formula X wherein J is hydrogen are also compounds of formula I and may be prepared by one of the foregoing methods. The compounds of formula CX may further be prepared by adaptation of methods already known in the art see for example Chemical Reviews 1950 46, p. 403425 . A further preparation of compounds of formula I is by reduction of a corresponding unsaturated compound of formula XI EMI13.1 wherein either Z3 is CR CH2 Y1 Y2 Y3 and Z4 is X X1 X2 X3 or Z3 is CH X2 X and Z4 is Y YÚ Yê Y in which each of R, X to X3 and Y to Y3 is as defined in formula I , with a suitable reducing agent. A suitable reducing agent is stannous chloride which may be used as an aqueous solution optionally in the presence of dilute mineral acid or catalytic hydrogenation may be effected in the presence of for example Raney nickel, platinum, palladium, ruthenium or rhodium. The choice of reducing agent in a given situation will of course be dictated by the presence of other reactive groups in the molecule which may themselves be susceptible to reduction. The intermediates of formula CXI may be prepared by the following series of reactions EMI13.2 EMI14.1 In the above formulae Z, Z3, Z4 and G have the same meaning as in formula XI and I II respectively, G3is alkyl for example n butyl and G4 is halogeno such as bromo. The formation of XIII is analogous to the ring closure involving a compound of formula CII and compounds of formula CXIV , are prepared using concentrated mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid. Tetrazoles of formula CI may be prepared from corresponding compounds wherein the group X3 is replaced byEMI14.2 wherein X4 and X5 together form a bond nitrile , X is hydrogen or alkyl and X, is alkoxy imidoester , alkylthio imidothioester , NH NH2 amidrazone , or amino amidine or X4 is hydroxy and X is amino amidoxime . The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar aprotic liquid medium such as dimethylformamide using a salt of hydrazoic acid e.g.sodium azide. However, when X3 is replaced by an amidine or amidrazone, a suitable reagent is nitrous acid. If an amidine is reacted with nitrous acid then reduction of the intermediate nitrosation product, with or without prior isolation, using for example sodium amalgam is required to give the corresponding tetrazole. The tetrazole precursor may be obtained by well known methods, for example the nitrile may be obtained by dehydration of the corresponding amide. The alcohols of formula I wherein X3 is hydroxymethylene may also be obtained by reduction with an appropriate reducing agent of the corresponding acid, ester, acid halide, acid anhydride or aldehyde.The appropriate reducing agent will depend on the particular substrate, but reactants which may be used are sodium in ethanol. In particular a carboxylic acid may for example be converted to a corresponding mixed anhydride with ethylchloroformate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, and subsequently reduced to the alcohol using sodium borohydride.Similarly an ester may be reduced to the alcohol using di iso butyl aluminium hydride in an inert solvent such as ether or hydrocarbon such as hexane or benzene.Such alcohols may also be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively the alcohols of formula CI wherein X is hydroxymethylene may be prepared by hydrolysis of a corresponding halide with an appropriate reagent. For this purpose a hydroxide may be used for example an aqueous alkali or a suspension of silver oxide in water. In the synthesis of hydantoins of formula CI having a hydroxyl group in a side chain it may be desirable to protect this during the course of the reaction. This may be readily effected in known manner using a protecting group such as acyl, aroyl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, l ethoxyethyl or aralkyl, for example benzyl. Removal of protecting groups may be carried out by appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art for example an acyl group may be removed by acid or base hydrolysis, and a benzyl group by reductive cleavage. Furthermore a ketone of formula CI wherein yl is carbonyl may be converted to the corresponding secondary alcohol by reduction with a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride. Also, an alcohol of formula CI wherein yl is CH.OH may be oxidised to the corresponding ketone using Honest reagent, acid dichromate or any other suitable reagent. Similarly where the compounds of formula CI have a C C or CH CH bond these may be converted by conventional hydrogenation techniques, for example using a Lindlar type or Adafis catalyst, to the corresponding ethylenic or saturated compounds as appropriate. The hydantoins of formula CI have an asymmetric 5 carbon atom, and a further asymmetric centre is present in those compounds wherein yl includes a hydroxyl group. Such alcohols therefore exist as four isomers which are separable by thin layer chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography into two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic mixture of two isomers. On separation of the diastereomers, one diastereomer may be converted to a mixture of the four isomers by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, and subsequently re separated to provide two diastereomers. Repeated use of this technique enables the effectual conversion of one diastereomer to the other this may be desirable when one diastereomer has a biological activity preferred to the other. The corresponding alcohols of formula III also exist in four isomeric forms. If desired, these may be separated into two epimers and subsequent cyclisation to a compound of formula I retains the stereochemical configuration. In all of the foregoing chemical procedures it is of course evident that the choice of reactant will be dictated in part by the functional groups present in the substrate, and where necessary reactants having an appropriate selectivity of action must be used. The hydantoins of formula I are of value in having pharmacological properties related to those of natural prostaglandins that is, the hydantoins mimic or antagonise the biological effects of members of the prostaglandin PG tAt, tBt, C , TDt, tFt and F series. For example, hydantoins of formula X have been found to mimic the antiaggregatory effect of PGE1 on blood platelets, and to antagonise the contraction induced byPGE2 or PGF2 on smooth muscle taken from the rat stomach, rat colon, chick rectum and guinea pig trachea. In general, antagonistic properties, as opposed to mimetic, have been observed when using larger doses of the hydantoins.The pharmacological profile, by which is meant the relative activities, mimetic or antagonistic, compared with the natural prostaglandins, will of course vary depending on the specific hydantoin under consideration. By reason of their prostaglandin related properties, the hydantoins of formula I are useful in the pharmacological characterisation and differentiation of the biological activities of the natural prostaglandins and their receptors . The further understanding of the physiological role of prostaglandins is of course valuable in the search for new and improved therapeutic substances. The hydantoins of formula CI are also of value as therapeutic agents. In particular hydantoins such as those described previously as having a potent anti aggregatory effect on blood platelets are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation or to reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and may be used to treat or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals, including man. For example, the compounds are useful in the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarcts, to treat and prevent thrombosis, to promote patency of vascular grafts following surgery, and to treat complications of arteriosclerosis and conditions such as atherosclerosis, blood clotting defects due to lipermia, and other clinical conditions in which the underlying aetiology is associated with lipid imbalance or hyperlipidemia.A further use for such compounds is as an additive to blood and other fluids which are used in artificial extra corporeal circulation and perfusion of isolated body portions. A group of compounds which are particularly valuable as inhibitors of platelet aggregation are those of formula I wherein Z is hydrogen Z1 is carboxyalkyl wherein the alkylene moiety has 3 to 9 carbon atoms and z2 is a group tCH2 2.CH.oH.Y2.Y3 2 wherein Y is a bond or branched alkylene having a tertiary carbon atom adjacent the hydroxy substituted carbon and Y3 is as defined in formula CI . Within this group of compounds, those wherein Z is carboxyhexyl and Y3 is cycloalkyl having 4 to 7 carbon atoms are especially active. The hydantoins of formula CI also cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in a similar way as do members of the prostaglandin A and E series.Compounds relaxing vascular smooth muscle are capable of inducing vasodilation and therefore have antihypertensive properties and are useful in lowering the blood pressure in mammals, including man, and may be used alone or in combination with a g adrenoceptor blocking agent or another antihypertensive substance for the treatment of all grades of hypertension including essential, malignant and secondary hypertension. The compounds of formula CI also mimic the effect of PGE1 of antagonising histamine induced broncho constriction. Compounds I having this property may be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of bronchial asthma and bronchitis by alleviating the bronchoconstriction associated with this condition. Hydantoins of formula Cl , which inhibit pentagastrin induced gastric acid secretion and reduce the formation of aspirin induced gastric lesions in rats are useful in reducing excessive gastric secretion, reducing and avoiding gastro intestinal ulcer formation and accelerating the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract whether such ulcers arise spontaneously or as a component of polyglandular adenoma syndromes. Intravenous infusions of hydantoins of formula I , to dogs increase the urine volume indicating a potential utility for such compounds as diuretic agents, the uses of which include the treatment of oedema for example oedema associated with heart failure, liver failure or kidney failure in man or other mammals. A further use for hydantoins of formula I which mimic the uterine smooth muscle effects ofPGE2 and PGF2a is as antifertility agents, in particular as abortifacients. In addition the compounds of formula I may be used in the treatment of proliferative skin diseases such as are associated with excessive cell division in the epidermis or dermis which may be accompanied by incomplete cell differentiation.Particular conditions which may be alleviated include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, nonspecific dermatitis, primary irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, lamellar icthyosis, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, premalignant sun induced keratosis, non malignant keratosis, acne, and seborrheic dermatitis in humans and atopic dermatitis and mange in domestic animals. For the treatment of these conditions the compounds are desirably applied topically to the affected skin. Alternatively they may be administered by an intradermal or intramuscular injection which may be directly into the skin lesion or into the surrounding tissue. Injectable compositions will generally contain from 0.1 to 0.58 w v of active ingredient. The amount of a compound of formula I required to achieve the desired biological effect will of course depend on a number of factors, for example, the specific compound chosen, the use for which it is intended, the mode of administration, and the recipient. In general, a daily dose may be expected to lie in the range of from liig to 20mg per kilogram bodyweight. For example, an intravenous dose may lie in the range of from 5ug to lmg kg which may conveniently be administered as an infusion of from 0.01 to 50vg per kilogram per minute. Infusion fluids suitable for this purpose may contain from 0.001 to 100, for example from 0.01 to lOg per millititre.Unit doses may contain from lOg to lOOmg of a compound of formula CI , for example ampoules for injection may contain from 0.01 to lmg, and orally administrable unit dose formulations such as tablets or capsules may contain from 0.1 to 50, for example 2 to 20mg, More specifically, when a compound of formulaCI is used to inhibit platelet aggregation it is generally desirable to achieve a concentration in the appropriate liquid, whether it be the blood of a patient or a perfusion fluid, of about lpg to lOmg, for example from lOg to lmg, per liter. The abovementioned doses refer to the acids, amides, esters, alcohols and tetrazoles of formula CI where a salt is used, the dose should be taken as referring to the corresponding anion. For use in the treatment or prophylaxis of the conditions referred to above, while the hydantoin compounds may be used as the raw chemical they are preferably presented with an acceptable carrier therefor as a pharmaceutical formulation.The carrier must of course be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, and is preferably formulated with a hydantoin compound as a unit dose formulation, for example a tablet, which may contain from 0.05 to 95t by weight of the hydantoin compound. Other pharmacologically active substances may also be present in formulations of the present invention as indicated above. The hydantoin compounds may be incorporated in the formulations either in the form of the acid or the salt or ester thereof, and the formulations may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixture of the components of the formulation. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical Cbuccal e.g. sub lingual , the parenteral Cthat is subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and on the nature of the hydantoin compound. Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of hydantoin compound as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid as an oilin water emulsion or as a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such formulations may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the hydantoin compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general they are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the hydantoin compound with liquid or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example a tablet may be prepared by compression or moulding a powder or granules of the hydantoin compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the hydantoin compound in a freeflowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agentCs .

Evaporation of the dried ether solution gave a viscous oil 6.8 g which was chromatographed on a column of silica gel to give 5 4 carhoxymethylthiobutyl 1 3 hydroxy 3 cyclohexylpropyl hydantoin as a viscous oil.Separation by HPLC on a column of silica with a mixture of chloroform, methanol and acetic acid 97 2.5 0.5 gave the two pure diastereomers, one being obtained as a viscous gum and the other forming colourless crystals, m.p. 104 1080C. The starting substances for Examples 15 to 17 1. diethyl 2 amino 6 thia octanedioate 2. diethyl 2 amino 7 thia non 4Z enoate and 3. diethyl 2 amino 7 thia non 4E enoate were obtained from 1. diethyl 3 chloropropylacetamidomalonate Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm., 1968, 33, 3823 2. diethyl 4 chlorobut 2Z enylacetamidomalonate cf. Chem. Eng. Data 1970 205 and 3. diethyl 4 chlorobut 2E enylacetamidomalonate Chem. Eng. Data. 1970 205 in a manner analogous to that described for the starting substance for Example 24. The starting substance for Example 20, S 4 Ethoxycarbonylbutyl L cysteine ethyl ester, was prepared as follows L cysteine ethyl ester hydrochloride 18.6 g, 0.10 mole was added to a solution of sodium 4.6 g, 0.20 g.a. in ethanol 320 ml., absolute , stirred 15 minutes and then the solvent removed in vacuo. To a solution of the residual sodium salts in dry dimethylsulphoxide 200 ml was added ethyl 5 bromovalerate 21.0 g, 0.10 mole in a single portion with stirring.The reaction mixture mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight, warmed on a steam bath for 5 minutes and then poured onto water 300 ml containing sodium dihydrogen phosphate 1 g . The oil was extracted with ether 3 x , the combined extracts washed with water and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo yielding 24.7 g of product as a pale yellow oil. S 3 Ethoxycarbonyl propyl L cysteine ethyl ester, used in Examples 18 and 19 was prepared in an analogous manner. Diethyl 2 amino 6 thianonanedioate, used in Example 23 was prepared as follows Diethyl 3 chloropropylacetamidomalonate Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm., 1968, 33, 3823 18.5 g and sodium iodide 100 mg were dissolved in absolute ethanol 90 ml and a solution of ethyl 3 mercaptopropionate 7.96 g in ethanolic sodium ethoxide from 1.37 g sodium and 75 ml ethanol added dropwise with stirring. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 45 hours, evaporated to low volume in vacuo then diluted with water and extracted with chloroform. The dried extract was evaporated giving crude diethyl acetamido 3 2 ethoxycarbonylethylthio propyl malonate 24 g as a pale yellow syrup.This was suspended in 10t aqueous hydrochloric acid 470 ml and the mixture refluxed for 3 hours, cooled, then evaporated to low bulk in vacuo, using ethanol to remove the last traces of water azeotropically. The residual gum was dissolved in a little ethanol and added to a solution of thionyl chloride 13.5 ml and ethanol 200 ml made up at 10 and the solution was allowed to stand at 50 for 18 hours, then refluxed for 1 hour. The cooled solution was evaporated and the residue partitioned between chloroform and aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The chloroform layer was separated and the aqueous layer extracted twice more with chloroform and the combined organic extracts dried and evaporated, and the residual oil subjected to column chromatography on silica. Elution with 7 methanol chlorcform gave diethyl 2 amino 6 thianonanedioate 7.0 g as a pale yellow oil.
