# A bubble switching device.

## Abstract
A bubble switching device includes two curved propaga tion elements 40, 42 positioned on a spacer layer 43 disposed on a layer of bubble domain supporting material 43 . A curved conductor 44 is superimposed on top of the propagation elements 40, 42 so that a current passing through the conductor element permits a bubble to be moved from one curved propagation element 40 to the second curved propagation element 42 .
