# Method of forming fluorescent screens of color picture tubes.

## Abstract
In a method of forming a fluorescent screen of a color picture tube by a dry process, the method comprises a first step of precoating an emulsion containing a powder of acryl resin on an inner surface of a face plate of the color picture tube, a second step of coating on the primary coating a photo sensitive composition consisting essentially of a diazonium salt to form a thin film, a third step of exposing to light a selected portion of the thin film to render the same to become adhesive, a fourth step of depositing a powder of a phosphor to form a phosphor layer of a first color and a fifth step of repeating the third and fourth steps to form phosphor layers of second and third colors. This method can prevent fogs caused by adhering phosphors of other colors to peripheries of previously deposited phosphor previously coated.
