# Apparatus for measuring impurities in super pure water.

## Abstract
A measuring apparatus for measuring the number and sizes of impurities such as dust and bacteria in super pure water includes a sealed container 1 , a sample supply line 17 which sealingly interconnects a source 16 of super pure water with the sealed container 1 and supplies a sample mixture of super pure water and electrolyte to the sealed container 1 an overflow pipe 18 which sealingly connects with the side of the sealed container 1 a negative electrode 3 which extends into the sample mixture in the sealed container 1 a hollow sensor 2 which extends into the sample mixture in the sealed container 1 the hollow sensor 2 containing a positive electrode 4 surrounded by electrolyte b and having a small hole 6 at its lower end and a detecting circuit connected to said negative 3 and positive eletrodes 4 for supplying a certain DC current therebetween and detecting voltage pulses caused by im purities pasing through the small hole 6 into the hollow sensor 2 .
