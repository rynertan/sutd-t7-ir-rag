## Description
A Method of treating exposed and developed radiation sensitive plates in lithographic printing plate production, compositions for use in the method, and the use of diazo eliminating compounds in improving the ink receptivity of lithographic printing images. This invention relates to lithographic printing. As is well known, a lithographic printing plate consists of ink receptive image areas and water receptive non image areas lying in substantially the same plane.Nowadays, virtually all lithographic plates are formed from radiation sensitive plates comprising a radiation sensitive coating on a suitable substrate.Image wise exposure of such a radiation sensitive plate to radiation using a suitable transparency causes the coating to change its characteristics in the areas struck by the radiation. In the most common form of plate i.e. a subtractive plate, the change in characteristics allows the coating to be selectively removed from the substrate in the non image areas by the application of a suitable developer to leave an image on the substrate. In the case of the so called positive working plate, the radiation struck areas of the coating are removed whereas in the case of the so called negative working plates it is the non radiation struck areas of the coating which are removed. For health and environmental reasons, the trend in negative working plates has been away from using coatings which need an organic solvent developer to remove the non radiation struck areas and towards those coatings where the non radiation struck areas can be removed with a substantially aqueous developer. Coatings containing diazo compounds as the main radiation sensitive constituent are ell known for use in aqueous developable plates and, in particular, those based on the condensation products of a diazodiphenylamine and a compound containing a reactive carbonyl group such as formaldehyde. Coatings containing such condensation products are well documented in the patent literature. In this regard reference may be made to British Patent SpecificationsNo.950,761, No.1,019,919, No.1,023,589, No.1,055,079,No.1,302,717, No.1,388,038, and, in particularNo.1,312,925. However radiation sensitive plates based on such coatings have not been entirely satisfactory in that the image is frequently reluctant to accept ink. In the use of such radiation sensitive plates to produce lithographic printing plates, the coating is exposed to radiation to an extent such that sufficient diazo groups are destroyed to produce an insolubilised product in the radiation struck areas. However it has been found that, under the conditions used in practice, this photolysis process is incomplete and that the radiation struck areas contain residual diazo groups. It has also been found that, during further processing of the plate, these residual diazo groups can enter into reactions which are detrimental to the performance of the plate.More particularly, it has been found that the residual diazo groups in the radiation struck areas which are the image areas can react with materials such as gum arabic, dextrin, etc. used in the final stage of the processing to desensitise and protect the non image areas.Such desensitising materials are hydrophilic and their reaction with the diazo groups causes hydrophilic material to be incorporated or bound into the image areas making the latter reluctant to accept ink. Such a reaction can take place merely by leaving a plate that has been treated with such materials in the dark at ambient temperature. The reaction will take place much quicker at elevated temperatures of if the plate is exposed to light. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the forgoing problem. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a litbographic printing plate from a radiation sensitive plate comprising a substrate having thereon a radiation sensitive coating containing a diazo compound, the method comprising image wise exposing the radiation sensitive plate, developing the image wise exposed plate to selectively remove the non radiation struck areas of the coating from the substrate, and treating the developed plate with a finishing composition comprising a compound capable of eliminating diazo groups. It has been found that the elimination of the diazo groups takes place in preference to the aforementioned reaction between the diazo groups and the desensitising material. Thus, the two steps of eliminating the residual diazo groups and of desensitising the plate can be carried out simultaneously using a single composition. Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention provides a plate finishing composition suitable for use in the above defined method which composition comprises i a compound capable of eliminating diazo groups, ii a lithographic desensitising material, and iii water. In a preferred embodiment the compound capable of eliminating diazo groups is a compound capable of entering into an azo coupling reaction with a diazo group. Preferably said compound contains an active methylene group and may be, for example, acetoacetanilide 3 hydroxyacetoacetanilide 4 chloro 2,5 dimethoxyaceto acetanilide 4 morpholinoacetoacetanilide N acetoacetyl 1 phenyl 3 methyl 5 pyrazolone benzylamine N,N bisacetoacetylethylene diamine or N cyanoacetyl morpholine. Alternative coupling compounds are 2,3 dihydroxynaphthalene 8 aminonaphthalene2 sulphonic acid 8 amino 1 naphthol 3, 6 disulphonic acid m phenylene diamine and phloroglucinol. In an alternative embodiment the compound capable of eliminating diazo groups is a compound capable of destroying the diazo groups by a reaction other than an azo coupling reaction for example by oxidation reduction reactions or substitution reactions. Examples of such compounds are ascorbic acid, hypophosphorous acid, titanous salts, chromous salts, stannous salts, sodium hydro sulphite, sodium stannite, hydroquinone, sodium hypochlorite, cuprous chloride, alkali metal iodides, potassium xanthate or benzoquinone. The lithographic desensitising material is preferably dextrin or gum arabic. Examples of other suitable lithographic desensitising materials are alginates such as sodium, potassium or ammonium alginate cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose or carboxy methyl cellulose acrylamide homopolymer and polymers containing structural units derived from acrylamide and from 1 to 257o by weight of structural units containing carboxyl groups. The finishing compositions are generally aqueous solutions and contain sufficient amounts of said diazo eliminating compound and said desensitising material to substantially completely destroy the residual diazo groups and to adequately desensitise the non image areas, respectively. Generally the composition will contain from about0j5to about 50 by weight of said desensitising material and the content of said compound capable of eliminating diazo groups will be from about 0.256 by weight up to the amount required to form a saturated solution. The latter amount will depend upon the nature of the compound capable of eliminating diazo groups and on the presence of other components in the composition. Such other components may be, for example, a surfactant and or a dispersing agent to assist in dissolution of the diazo group eliminating compound and desensitising material and or acid oralkali to provide a pR suitable for the particular diazo group eliminating compound and desensitising material used. In this regard, the finishing composition will generally be alkaline in the case where the diazo group eliminating compound is an azo coupler having a phenolic hydroxy or reactive methylene group or acid in the case where the coupler contains an amino group e.g. m phenylene diamine.Examples of such other components are the sodium salt of dodecylated oxydibenzene disulphonic acid, sodium polyacrylate, hydrochloric acid,potassium hydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, trisodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide. The compositions of the present invention are normally produced by stirring together the water, the diazo eliminating compound, the lithographic desensitising material and any other components as appropriate under ambient conditions. If desired, however, the mixing may be effected at slightly elevated temperature in order to assist dissolution. Thus, by way of example, the trisodium phosphate or other pH adjusting component may be added to the water heated to about 600C followed by the addition of the sodium salt of dodecylated oxydibenzene disulphonic acid or other surfactant and then by the addition of the acetoacetanilide or other diazo eliminating compound. Thereafter the dextrin or other lithographic desensitising material is added to obtain the desired composition. By means of the present invention it is possible to increase theink receptivity of the printing images of lithographic plates formed from radiation sensitive coatings based on diazo compounds.

Each radiation sensitive plate was exposed beneath a negative transparency in a printing down frame and developed with an aqueous solution of iso propanol. Separate areas of each plate were then treated respectively with a 2 aqueous solution of acetoacetanilide 3 hydroxyacetoacetanilide 4 chloro 2,5 dimethoxyaceto acetanilide 4 morpholinoacetoacetanilide N acetoacetyl benzylamine N,N bisacetoacetyl ethylene diamine N cyanoacetyl morpholine and 2,3 dihydroxy naphthalenenas finishing solution, the solution in each case being alkaline and including a surfactant Dowfax 2A1 .Separate areas of each plate were also treated respectively with an alkaline 2 aqueous solution of 8 aminonaphthalene 2 sulphonic acid a 2 aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and a 2 aqueous solution of hypophosphorous acid as finishing solution. One area of each plate was left untreated. The plates were dried and the whole.of the plate surfaces were treated with a desensitiser aqueous gum arabic solution . The plates were stored in daylight for one day and then placed on an offset press. Whereas the areas on the plates which had been treated prior to being desensitised with gum arabic accepted ink within 3 or 4 revolutions of the press, the area of each plate which had been desensitised only was reluctant to take ink even after 30 revolutions. The tests were repeated but in this case the plates were stored for. one week in daylight before being placed on the press The treated areas of each plate again took ink quickly, whereas the areas which had been desensitised only would not take ink even after several hundred revolutions.
