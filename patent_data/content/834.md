# Process for producing modified phenolic resins.

## Abstract
A drying oil, for example isomerized linseed oil or dehydrated castor oil, which has an iodine value of 140 or more and a content of conjugated double bonds of less than 50 is reacted with isopropenylphenol and or at least one oligomer thereof in an amount, by weight, generally of 0.1 2 times as great as that of the drying oil in the presence of a small amount of an acid preferably at a temperature of 65 150 C for 0.5 3 hours to modify the oil. By the modifying reaction, isopropenylphenol and or its oligomer s is are introduced into the drying oil while leaving the double bonds of the oil as they are. The thus modified oil is further reacted with a phenol or phenols under strongly acidic conditions to introduce therein one or more phenols to further modify the oil. The further modified drying oil serving as a phenolic component or a part thereof is then reacted with formladehyde or a compound based on formaldehyde to give a modified phenolic resin. This modified phenolic resin is useful for making a phenolic laminate with improved flexibility, punching quality and waterproofness.
