# Display panel and method of operating it.

## Abstract
This disclosure is of a display panel 10 comprising a gas filled envelope 20, 30 having a first portion including an array of D.C. gas discharge cells 72 , and a second portion including an array of quasi A.C. gas discharge cells 94 , there being one A.C. cell for each D.C. cell. The A.C. cells are the display cells of the panel and include electrode means for sustaining glow therein, and the D.C. cells are operated in a scanning fashion to address selected A.C. cells in which glow is to be displayed, and they include electrode means for this purpose. The actual operation of addressing or selecting, and firing or turning off, the desired A.C. display cells is achieved by the controlled interaction of the D.C. and A.C. cells and after the selected display cells have been fired and caused to exhibit visible glow, the glow is sustained, until being erased, by the electrodes 100, 80 associated with the A.C. cells.
