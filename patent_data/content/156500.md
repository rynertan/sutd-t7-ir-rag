# Fluid dispensing assembly.

## Abstract
A dispensing device is disclosed which includes a con nector valve 19 and a diaphragmic container valve 41 that permits a fluid dispensing passageway to be connected to a disposable container of fluid in a simple, efficient manner to provide continuous fluid flow. The connector valve 19 en gages the container valve 41 to simultaneously open both the container valve 41 and the connector valve 19 in a single connecting step to dispense fluid from the container into the dispensing passageway. Upon disengagement of the valves, both valves simultaneously close. The assembly is simple, lightweight and inexpensive, thereby being particu larly suitable for use with lightweight disposable fluid con tainers.
