# Web accumulator with arcuate guide supports.

## Abstract
Double faced corrugated board issuing continuously from a double backer 11 is fed into an accumulator pit 90 forming a downwardly extending loop 15a therein. The web is with drawn intermittently from the upper end of the pit and fed to a reciprocating cutting and creasing press 12 which produces box blanks. Adjustable curved guide supports 20, 25 are provided for the web at the upstream and downstream ends of the accumulator. Curvatures of these supports are adjusted to permit the web, as it enters and leaves and accumulator pit, to assume curves each of a radius that approaches but is no less than a critical radius below which unwanted transverse scores will form in the web.
