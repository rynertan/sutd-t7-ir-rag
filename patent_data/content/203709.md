# Attenuation of microwave signals.

## Abstract
It is sometimes necessary to reduce the power of micro wave transmissions, e.g. to avoid overloading a receiver or to reduce a transmitter s potential to cause interference. The in vention reduces the power by inserting radiation absorbent material 14 into the aperture of the antenna 10 . In the preferred embodiment a membrane of absorbent plastics is stretched across the aperture of the dish reflector.
