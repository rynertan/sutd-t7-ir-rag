# Method and device for determining an NMR distribution in a region of a body.

## Abstract
The method and the device for making NMR images in accordance with the invention utilize additional measure ments and additional calculations in order to achieve a substantial reduction of image artefacts caused by respira tory motion of the body. The additional measurements involve the sampling of the non conditioned FID or spin echo signal which can but need not be performed during each measurement cycle without consuming a substantial amount of additional measurement time. The non conditioned signal samples are used to derive a reference frequency spectrum which is a measure of the size of the object. By comparing this reference with the frequency spectra of the various measurement cycles, standardization is obtained so that image signals produce an unambiguous image even though they have been derived from signal samples taken from measurement cycles performed in different states of motion different object size .
