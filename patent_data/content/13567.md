# A method of purifying gas containing gaseous mercury and gaseous hydrogen chloride.

## Abstract
A method of highly efficiently separating preferably low contents of gaseous mercury from a gas mixture, where the gas mixture is caused to contact a solid sorbent consisting of powdered calcium hydroxide, which in on atmosphere con taining hydrogen chloride is to a certain part converted to calcium chloride. The temperature of the gas mixture is bet ween 350 K and 550 K. The contact between the gas and the sorbent preferably takes place in a fluidized bed, whereafter the sorbent is separated in a dust separator. The method is suitable for use at the separation of mercury occuring in flue gases, for example, from refuse incinerators or in mercury containing gases from process industries. At experiments with flue gas from a refuse incinerator the mercury content was reduced from 200 to 5 Âµg of gaseous mercury cubic metre flue gas.
