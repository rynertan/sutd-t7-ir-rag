## Description
TITLE A MEMBRANE AND AN ARRANGEMENT FOR THE REMOVAL OF A SUBSTANCE FROM A SOLUTIONTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a microporous, semipermeable asymmetric membrane to be used in conjunction with the removal of a substance from a solution. The membrane comprises a bidogically active substance which is immobilized in the pores of the membrane to make diffusion contact with the said solution. The invention relates moreover to an arrangement for the removal of a substance from a solution. The arrangement comprises a microporous semipermeable, asymmetric membrane of the type specified above. The expression removal in accordance with the invention refers to an actual removal by adsorption pr chemical bonding of the substance concerned to the biologically active substance as well as to a removal by chemical or biological conversion of this substance with the help of the biologically active substance. Examples of applications of actual removal of the substance may be found in connection with therapeutic treatment of a body fluid, especially blood, as described for example in Swedish patent application No. 8104294 7, where undesirable substances, e.g. antibody antigen complexes are removed by bonding the substance to the biologically active substance, e.g. protein A. Examples of applications with removal by chemical or biological conversion of the substance may be found in so called enzyme therapy where an undesirable substance, for example in the blood, is converted by enzymatic action on the substance in contact with the biologically active substance the enzyme . Other examples may be found in conjunction with purely industrial preparative processes, where a solution containing the substance concerned is brought into contact with the biologically active substance for a conversion of the substance to the desired compound. Even though the invention consequently has a wide and diverse scope of application, it has been found to be particularly valuable in conjunction with the treatment of whole blood in so called enzyme therapy and it will be described in the following with the emphasis placed on the lastmentioned application.BACKGROUND ART Enzyme therapy is a form of treatment where it is endeavoured to replace a lost or diminished enzymatic function in a patient, for example in conjunction with genetically conditioned diseases or as in certain forms of cancer, e.g. lymphoblastic leukaemia, to supply a desired enzymatic function. The treatment in general is taking place so that the enzyme, for example asparaginase in the case of patients with lymphoblastic leukaemia, is allowed to come into contact with the patient s blood in the blood stream for the enzymatic breakdown of a substrate The enzyme can then break down asparagine, which is essential for the tumour cells, and this means that the tumour cells die owing to lack of nourishment. This can be done by intravenous injection of a solution containing asparaginase into the patient. The form of treatment described above is unsatisfactory in a number of respects, firstly because as a rule human enzymes are not available, making it necessary to use enzymes from, for example, mammals or bacteria. If such non human enzymes come into contact with blood corpuscles in the patient s blood antibodies against the enzyme in question will be formed, so that the enzymes become ineffective, since the antibodies will rapidly stop the function of the enzyme. In certain cases anaphylactoid reactions may also occur in the patient as a consequence of the reaction between antibody and enzyme the antigen . Even in cases where human enzymes are accessible for the treatment, the problems are considerable, since the stability of enzymes in the patient s bloodstream is often low and it becomes difficult consequently to maintain the enzymatic activity at a satisfactory therapeutic level In Chemical Engineering Communications 2 1975 1, p. 37 47, a technique is proposed according to which a microporous, semipermeable, asymmetric membrane is used with a biologically active substance enzyme enclosed in the pores of the membrane to make diffusion contact with a solution containing a substance which is to be broken down or in a similar manner removed from the solution.One disadvantage of this technique consists in that it can only be used in conjunction with high molecular enzymes, since smaller enzymes may penetrate through the membrane pores and thus obtain free access to the solution which, for example, may be a body fluid.A further disadvantage can be redistribution of the enzyme axial enzyme transport bringing with it impaired stability and consequently lower effectivity. It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to produce an improved membrane and arrangement for the removal of a substance from a solution in accordance with the technique as described in the abovementioned Chemical Engineering Communications.In particular the invention aims at providing a new form of enzyme therapy by which the aforementioned inconveniences are avoided, regardless of whether human enzymes or enzymes from mammals or bacteria are used. The abovementioned object is achieved in accordance with the invention with the help of the membrane and the arrangement as defined in the following claims and which will be described in the following text.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION In accordance with the invention a microporous, semipermeable, asymmetric membrane to be used in conjunction with the removal of a substance from a solution is provided, this membrane comprising a biologically active substance which is immobilized in the pores of the membrane to make diffusion contact with the said solution. The membrane is characterized in that the biologically active substance is immobilized on and or in microparticulate gel grains. An asymmetric membrane is known per se from, for example, US patent 3 615 024, and will therefore not be described here in detail. For more detailed information concerning such membranes, reference is made instead to US patent 3 615 024. However, to facilitate understanding of the invention it should be mentioned that asymmetric membranes are made up on the one side by a very thin layer with small pores barrier layer and on the other side by a thicker layer with larger pores support layer , the pores gradually increasing in size from the barrier layer towards the support layer where the pores are thus of maximum size. In accordance with the invention the asymmetric membrane should have sufficiently large pores in the support layer so that the immobilized biologically active substance, in particular an enzyme, can readily penetrate deeply into the membrane pores from that side, and at the same time have sufficiently small pores on the barrier layer side to prevent the substance from penetrating wholly through the membrane. Furthermore, the membrane in accordance with the invention shall have sufficiently small pores on the barrier layer side to exclude undesirable components when the membrane is intended to be used in conjunction with the treatment of whole blood in enzyme therapy. At the same time as with the help of the membrane in accordance with the invention contact between the immobilized, enclosed biologically active substance and the solution containing the said substance is avoided, it is an advantage that a very short diffusion distance between the solution containing the said substance and the immobilized active substance can be obtained owing to the immobilized substance being able to penetrate deeply into the pores of the membrane towards the barrier layer side of the membrane which is intended to face towards the solution containing the said substance. Examples of suitable pore sizes of the membrane in accordance with the invention may be 1 vm, preferably 10 um on the support layer side, whilst the barrier layer side may have a cut off of under 150,000 Daltons, preferably 20,000 50,000 Daltons. The membrane in accordance with the invention may be in the form of a plane sheet or flexible tube, but is preferably in the form of hollow fibres, the solution containing the said substance being intended to pass through the axial cavity of these fibres. Examples of material used for the membrane in accordance with the invention may be polyamide, cellulose acetate, polysulphone, polycarbonate, polyacrylonitrile, preferably polyamide. With regard to other usable materials, reference is made to the abovementionedUS patent 3 615 024. Suitable microparticulate gel grains may be those described for example in US patent 4 061 466. Preferably these gel grains are spherical particles of a polyacrylic derivative, agarose or polystyrene, preferably polyacrylamide. In accordance with the invention the said gel grain has a diameter of 10 vm, preferably 0.1 0.5 pm. Examples of biologically active substances usable may be antibodies, antigens, enzymes, protein A, killed bacteria or fragments thereof, preferably enzymes. In accordance with the invention an arrangement for the removal of a substance from a solution is also provided, this arrangement comprising a microporous, semipermeable, asymmetric membrane with a biologically active substance immobilized inside the pores of the membrane to make diffusion contact with the said solution.The arrangement is characterized in that the biologically active substance is immobilized on and or in the microparticulate gel grains. The membrane in accordance with the invention described above is intended to be used as the said asymmetric membrane. For more detailed information concerning the same, reference is made therefore to the above description. in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the arrangement in accordance with the invention, the membrane is used in the form of hollow fibres enclosed within an outer casing with a first inlet and a first outlet communicating with the axial cavity of the fibres. The casing may comprise moreover a second inlet and a second outlet communicating with an outer, closed liquid cycle for a liquid which is intended to be passed through the said casing on the outside of the hollow fibres, as will be described in the following. The outer liquid cycle preferably comprises a pump for the transport of the said liquid in pulsating flow through the casing on the outside of the hollow fibres. By allowing the pulsating flow to take place with small pulse variations, high and low pressure will be created alternatingly inside the casing, as a result of which the transport of permeating fractions of the solution containing the said substance, flowing through the axial cavity of the hollow fibres, through the hollow fibre walls, to make contact with the enclosed immobilized biologically active substance, is facilitated. When the arrangement in accordance with the invention is intended to be used for the treatment of whole blood, the outer liquid cycle preferably also comprises a detector for discovering any leakage of whole blood inside the casing.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS The invention will be described in more detail in the following with reference to the enclosed schematic drawings, wherein fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the arrangement in accordance with the invention, fig. 2 shows a preferred embodiment of a membrane in accordance with the invention forming part of the arrangement shown in fig. 1. fig. 3 is an enlarged cross section of the membrane in fig. 2 taken along line Ill Ill and fig. 4 shows a practical embodiment of an outer casing enclosing a membrane in accordance with the invention and intended to be used as part of the arrangement in accordance with the invention shown in fig. 1.BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT TES INVENTION As can be seen schematically in fig. 1, the arrangement in accordance with the invention comprises an asymmetric membrane shown schematically by broken lines 1, 1 , 1 with enclosing outer casing 2 provided with a first inlet 3 and a first outlet 4 and with a second inlet 5 and a second outlet 6. The first inlet 3 of the casing 2 is connected to a source 7 for the solution containing the said substance via a conduit 8 comprising a pump 5, whilst the first outlet 4 of the casing 2 is connected to the said source 7 via a return conduit 10 to bring the solution back to this source. The second inlet 5 of the casing 2 is connected to the second outlet 6 via a conduit 11 comprising a pump 12 and a detector 13 forming a closed outer liquid cycle. As is evident from fig. 2 and 3, the asymmetric membrane is preferably in the form of hollow fibres 1, preferably of polyamide, with the biologically active substance 14, for example an enzyme, immobilized on a carrier 16 of microparticulate polyacrylamide grains of a size such that they can penetrate easily into the pores 15 through pore openings on the support layer side 17 of the hollow fibres 1 up to a very short distance from the inner wall 19 barrier layer of the axial cavity 18. The pore openings on the barrier layer side 19 of the hollow fibres are sufficiently small to prevent these gel grains 16 carrying stabilized biologically active substance 14 from penetrating completely through the pores 15. In the treatment, for example, of whole blood in conjunction with enzyme therapy these gel grains 16 are of a size of under 10 pm, preferably 0.1 0.5 pm, whilst the pores on the support layer side 17 of the hollow fibres may be greater than 1 pm, preferably greater than 10 pm. The barrier layer 19 of the hollow fibres may have a cut off of under 150,000 Daltons, preferably 20,000 50,000 Daltons, as a result of which undesirable substances in the whole blood, which is intended to pass through the axial cavity 18 of the hollow fibres, are prevented from penetrating into the pores 15 to make contact with the biologically active substance, for example asparaginase. It is thus evident from the above that the first inlet 3 communicates with the first outlet 4 via the axial cavity 18 of the hollow fibres 1, 1 , 1 inside the casing 2, and that the second inlet 5 communicates with the second outlet 6 via the space which is formed between the casing 2 and the outside of the hollow fibres 1, 1 , 1 . In fig. 4 is shown a practical embodiment of the outer casing shown in fig. 1 enclosing an asymmetric membrane. The same reference numerals as in fig. 1 3 have been used therefore in fig. 4 for corresponding components, but with the addition of the letter a . As can be seen, the casing 2a is in the form of a conventional fibre dialyzer provided with a first inlet 3a and a first outlet 4a and with a second inlet 5a and a second outlet 6a. The inlet 3a is connected to the outlet Lia via the axial cavity of these fibres, whilst the inlet 5a is connected to the outlet 6a via the space which is formed between the casing 2a and the outside of the enclosed hollow fibres la, l a, l a. The arrangement functions in the following manner The solution containing the said substance which is to undergo an enzymatic conversion is conveyed with the help of the pump 9 from its source 7 to the inlet 3 of the casing 2 via the conduit 8 and through the axial cavity of the fibres 1, 1 , 1 back to the source 7 via the outlet 4 and the conduit 10. At the same time a liquid, for example a physiological salt solution is pumped into the closed outer liquid cycle with the help of the pump 12 through the casing 2 via the inlet 5 and the outlet 6 on the outside of the hollow fibres 1, 1 , 1 .During the passage through the axial cavity of the hollow fibres 1, 1f, 1 of the solution permeating fractions of the solution containing the said substance will penetrate into the pores 15 to make contact with the biologically active substance 14, preferably an enzyme, to achieve an enzymatic conversion of the said substance. Undesirable substances in the solution, such as antibodies in conjunction with whole blood, are prevented from penetrating into the pores 15, so that a direct contact between these substances and the enclosed biologically active substance 14 is prevented. The penetration of the permeating fractions of the solution is facilitated by the pulsating flow in the outer liquid cycle which is achieved with the help of the pump 12.By means of the detector any rapid leakage of the solution, for example blood inside the casing 12, is rapidly discovered and the system is stopped. The invention will be illustrated further with the help of the following concrete examples. In all examples a haemofiltration unit of the hollow fibre type polyamide from Gambro is used.Examples 1 3 In these examples 1 3 the biologically active substance consists of the enzyme asparaginase from E. coli Crasnitin, Bayer , stabilized on microparticulate polyamide grain 0.2 0.5 pm en closed in hollow fibre pores in the manner as described above. The plasma asparagine is determined according to a fluorometric method D.A. Cooney, R.L. Capizzi and R.E. Handschumacher, Cancer Research 30, 929 935, 1970 . In example 1 a dog weight 12 kg is treated with a unit containing 500 U L asparaginase.The L asparaginase content in the plasma is reduced from 46 nmole ml to 2 nmole ml after 225 minutes treatment. The blood flow was 20 ml min. In example 2 the same haemofiltration unit as in example 1 was used with an L asparaginase solution 2 1 containing 50 nmole Lasparagine per ml. The L asparagine content is reduced practically speaking completely within 30 40 minutes at a flow of 150 200 ml min. In example 3 sheep weight 40 kg are treated with a haemofiltration unit of the same type as in example 1 and 2, but containing 2 000 U L asparaginase in microparticulate polyacrylamide grain. The L asparaginase content is reduced from normally 40 50 nmole ml to 10 nmole ml after 120 minutes treatment at a blood flow of 150 200 ml min. A further example to show the application of the present invention in purely industrial processes is the following Example 4 Manufacture of stereospecific amino acids with the help of bacterial enzymes. The stereospecific transformation of ammonium fumarate toL aspartic acid by means of an amination reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme aspartase from E. coli. The enzyme is immobilized in microparticles 0.25 0.5 pm of the abovementioned type and is installed in the outer space of a haemofiltration unit, for example of the type used in examples 1 3 with asymmetric membrane.A solution containing the said substance, which in this example is ammonium fumarate, is pumped through the unit, the substance being brought into contact by diffusion with the aspartase and being converted to L aspartic acid which is subsequently isolated.Example 5 Manufacture of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 6 APA . The biologically active substance, in this example penicillinacylase from E. coli is immobilized in the asymmetric membrane in a haemofiltration unit as described, whereupon a solution containing raw penicillins is pumped through the unit. The raw penicillins, which are obtained from Penicillum cultures, are converted in the reactor to 6 aminopenicillanic acid, which subsequently is isolated and may be used for specific synthetic penicillins.Example 6 Manufacture of glucose and galactose from lactose. In this example 6 galactosidase from E coli or yeast fungus is used as a biologically active substance according to the invention and the procedure is the same as above. A solution containing lactose accordingly will form glucose and galactose by contact with the immobilized biologically active substance inside the haemofiltration unit. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The arrangement and the membrane in accordance with the invention are applicable for example in conjunction with the enzymatic conversion of a substance present in a solution, as in therapeutic treatments or analyses of body fluids as well as in industrial processes which include an enzymatic conversion. It is particularly valuable in conjunction with different types of treatments or processes where it is desired to remove a substance from a solution either by adsorption or chemical bonding of the actual substance to a biologically active substance, or by chemical or biological conversion of the substance through contact with the biologically active substance. Examples of the former application may be found in conjunction with a therapeutic treatment of blood where undesirable substances, e.g. antibody antigen complexes in the blood are removed by means of bonding to the biologically active substance, e.g. protein A. Examples of the latter application may be found in conjunction with so called enzyme therapy according to which an undesirable substance for example a body fluid, especially whole blood, is removed through enzymatic conversion in contact with the biologically active substance the enzyme . A further example may be found in conjunction with purely industrial preparative processes, where the substance concerned in contact with the biologically active substance is converted by means of a biological or chemical conversion reaction to a desired compound.
