## Abstract
A collapsible container for medicaments or other liquids which must be preserved from contamination has a valve assembly which comprises a hollow projection 3 which is closed at its outer end and which has one or more apertures in the wall through which the contents of the container are dispensed. The projection 3 is surrounded by a resiliently stretchable sleeve 10 which stretches to allow liquid dispensed through the apertures 9 to pass but which after dispensing seals the outlet of the apertures 9 to minimise the ingress of contaminants.
