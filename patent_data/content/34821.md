# Pulse generation by changing magnetic field.

## Abstract
A pulser unit is composed of two high strength magnets 30, 32 spaced apart from one another and establishing an intense magnetic field therebetween. Forward faces 30f,32f of the two magnets 30,32 establish a working surface for the pulser unit. A Wiegand wire module consisting of a Wiegand wire segment 34 around which a pickup coil 36 is wound is mounted in the pulser unit immediately behind the working surface of the pulser unit and adjacent the sides of the two spaced apart magnets 30,32 . The magnetic field is suffi ciently strong to determine the state of the Wiegand wire 34 . When a low reluctance element 20 is brought adjacent to the front of the working surface, the field is substantially distorted and the field to which the Wiegand wire 34 is subjected changes materially. The result is that the Wiegand wire 34 switches state and the substantial rate of change of the flux in that switching of state is sensed by the pickup coil 36 to provide an output pulse. Similarly, removal of the low reluc tance element causes the field to revert so that the wire switches state back thereby inducing an output pulse in the pickup coil 36 . The pulser can conveniently be kept station ary while the actuating low reluctance element 20 is moved past the working face of the pulser.
