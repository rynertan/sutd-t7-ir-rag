# An additive tri colour lamp house for a photographic printer.

## Abstract
An additive tri colour lamp house 10 having three lamps 14,16,18 for conveying filtered light into a mixing chamber 54 and illuminating a photographic image con tained on a photographic film. The illuminated image is then projected onto a photosensitive paper for the purpose of making photographic prints and copies. The lamp house 10 is characterized by having a combination of additive primary colour filters 24,26,28 and subtrative primary col our filters 34,38,42,44 positioned in front of the lamps and the amount of each additive primary colour i.e. red, green and blue conveyed through the filters 24,26,28,34,38,42,44 is controlled. By the proper positioning of the colour filters in front of the lamps 14,16,18 , the time required for proper exposure of the three separate emulsion layers on conven tional colour print paper is approximately equal.
