# Improvements in solenoid operated directional valves.

## Abstract
Solenoid operated directional valves have electrical apparatus for actuating solenoids 14,16 , including improved terminal blocks 22 mounted on the valve body and electrical plugs and associated junction boxes by which electrical power is supplied to the terminal block for delivery to the appropriate solenoid, the terminal block and electrical plugs having electrical connectors 50, 52, 60, 62 and a ground connector 46 so arranged relative to axes 42 and 44 of the block as to enable the electrical plug and the junction box to be mounted in more than one position with respect to the termi nal block while providing continuity of operation of the sol enoids, ground connections and lamp indicator means 68, 70 .
