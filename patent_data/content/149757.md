# Digital memory system suitable for use as a display buffer.

## Abstract
The system includes a plurality of digital memory units 20, 22,...50 each for storing a plurality of independently addressable binary bits. The units operate together in response to each common bit address to supply a bit from each unit to form an array of bits for a discrete section of a larger array. The units are interconnected through common interconnection buses e.g. 128, 140 and selective controls 134, 136 to input and output gate connections e.g. 126, 138 to those buses to provide for selective shifting of bits between units to change the bit array.
