# Process for the preparation and use of organic antimony cracking catalysts.

## Abstract
Antimony tricarboxylates of higher carboxylic acids and suitable for use in the passivation of metal contaminants which interfere with the functioning of zeolite containing hydrocarbon cracking catalysts in a hydrocarbon cracking process, can be prepared in high yields by a reacting antimony oxide with an anhydride of a lower organic acid, b reacting the product from a with at least one higher carboxylic acid at a temperature sufficient to vaporise volatile material and removing the vaporised volatile mate rial, c optionally simultaneously passing a stream of an inert gas through the reaction mixture, and d recovering the antimony tricarboxylate of said higher carboxylic acid.
