# Process for preparing a pitch material.

## Abstract
A pitch, suitable as a feedstock for carbon artifact manufacture, is obtained by adding a polycondensed aroma tic oil, preferably a pitch oil, to a steam cracker tar and or a sub atmospheric pressure stripped steam cracker tar to provide a mixture and heat soaking said mixture at a temperature in the range of from about 350 C to about 430 C, preferably for 30 minutes to about 5 hours. Preferably a suitable dialkylation catalyst, for example AlClâ‚ƒ, is present during the heat soaking.
