# Rapping mechanism for an electrostatic precipitator.

## Abstract
A rapping mechanism for an electrostatic precipitator comprises hammers 1 which are swingable on a shaft 2 carrying a driver pin 6 . As the shaft rotates, the driver pin 6 engages a surface 7 of a pawl 4 , which is pivoted on the hammer 1 , thus picking up and raising the hammer until the pawl 4 is disengaged from the driver pin 6 by an adjustable release tap 9 . The hammer then swings back down under gravity and raps a bar 13 connected to electrodes.
