# Temperature measurement.

## Abstract
Temperature is measured by launching pulses of light into an elongate optical fibre and determining the tempera ture at positions along the fibre from the intensity of light scattered at those positions. The input pulses can have either the same or two different wavelengths, and the scattered light can be either Raman or Brillouin scattered and either forward scattered or backscattered. One position along the fibre can be maintained at a known temperature in order to provide a reference for other calculations. In particular embodiments the temperature is derived from the ratio between the intensities at two anti Stokes wavenumber shifts or between an anti Stokes scattered and a Rayleigh scatterd intensity measurement. Otherwise the intensities of Stokes and anti Stokes shifted brillouin back scattered light can be used to derive the temperature.
