# Truncated motor vehicle headlamp.

## Abstract
A vehicle lamp, such as a headlamp or fog lamp, having a concave reflector 11 truncated at its top and bottom, one of the truncated surfaces 23, 24 being closer to the optical axis than the other truncated surface, and both truncated surtaces being substantially non reflective. This achieves significant glare control without requiring a separate shield between the light source 14 and the reflector.

## Description
TRUNCATED MOTOR VESICLE HEADLAMP BACKGROUND OF The invention is in the field of lamps for automobiles and other vehicles, such as headlamps and fog lamps, having truncated reflectors, i.e., reflectors having a concave surface which is truncated at the top and or bottom. Certain headlamp reflectors are truncated at their top xnd or bottom to reduce their vertical height for better fitting and styling in automobiles In these and other types of headlamps, a shield or other means is used to achieve sharp bean cutoff to reduce glare above the hori on tal, specifically in low beam lamps used for city driving. fl.S. Patents 1,359,789 to Brown and 4,276,583 to Fratty disclose truncated headlamps, in which Brown employs an auxiliary reflector and Pratty employs a shield to reduce glare. Attempts to design truncated headlamps having reduced glare, without the use of internal shields, have not been completely successful, especially where the filament is enclosed in a glass inner bulb. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION objects of the invention are to provide an improved and economical truncated vehicle lamp of compact size, vithout shielding the filament from the reflector, and which protects a light beam, when installed on a vehicle, that is substantially entirely below the horizontal thereby significantly reducing glare. The invention comprises, briefly and in a preferred embodiment, a vehicle lamp having a generally parabolic or concave reflector which is truncated at its top bottom or sides, thus providing one or sore flat sections subs tan tially parallel to the reflector s optical axis. The optical axis does not coincide with the center of the reflector. Furthermore, the flat surfaces are non reflective, such as by being transparent or light absorbing. This con struction achieves the desired inpraveent in glare reduction and eliminates the need for prior art filament shield. BRlEF DESCRIPTION OF fEE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a front view of a headlamp in accordance with a preferred embodiinent of the invention. ZG. 2 is a side sectional view taken on the line 2 2 of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is a horizontal sectional view taken on the line 3 3 of FIG. 1. DESCRIPTION OF TEE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The headlamp comprises a reflector 11 having a generally parabolic or other concave reflecting surface 12 which may be a true parabola or a acidified parabola configuration having an optical axis 13.A light bulb 14, preferably a halogen typc, is held in the reflector 11 by conventional or other suitable arans, and contains a filament 16 or other suitable light source at or near the optical axis 13 and also at or near the focal point of the reflector 12 so that the reflector 12 will reflect light from the light source 16 in a desired forward pattern as exemplified by the reflected light ray 17. If desired, the front top half of the bulb 14 lay be rendered opaque, such as with a coat nag 18 of dark material, to block light rays that would emanate directly through the lens at m upward angle above the horizontal optical axis 13. The top and bottom parts of the reflector 11 are truncated to form substantially flat top and bottom sections 21, 22 which My both be parallel to the optical axis 13.A transparent cover plate or lens can be attached over the front opening of the reflector in conventional manner. One of the flat sections, such as the top section 21, is considerably closet to the optical axis 13 than is the other flat section 22, whereby the reflecting surface 12 is approximately a half section, or slightly wider, of the more conventional sy netrical parabolic reflector. This provides more accurate beam design control of the reflected beam pattern and achieves substantial reduction of undesirable glare light above horizontal by eliminating the conventional parabolic upper half reflecting surface which, if present, would cause some glare light having an upward directional component.The light source 16 should be frontwardly of the junction lines 21 and 22 of the flat sections 21, 22 and the parabolic section 12, at least in the vicinity 22t of the vertical plane in which the light source lies, to prevent glare rays caused by light reflected from inner surface areas of the bulb, frontwardly of the light source, and re reflected by the parabolic reflector surface. In accordance with the invention, one or both of the top and bottom reflector sections 21, 22 are made so as to be substantially non reflective of light. This can be accomplished by awaking the transparent, or of a lightabsorbing material, or coating the, preferably at their inner surfaces 23, 24, with a dark non reflective material such as paint. The ttrmrr non reflective and substantially aca reflectiv as used herein mean that a surface has a low reflectivity so as to reduce glare in accordance with the invention, it being recognized that it is difficult or impossible to achieve absolutely zero reflect try at a surface. As has been described, the parabolic reflecting surface 12 reflects light rays from the light source 16 in a desired frontwardly direction, and, if desired, can be contoured to reflect some light downwardly and frontwardly to illuminate the road near the vehicle, none of this reflected light having a deliberate upward component which can cause glare for oncoming motorists. Also, some light from the light source 16 will project directly frontwardly and downwardly through the front of the head lamp adding to the nearby road illumination but not causing glare.As has been stated, the opaque coating 18 on the front of the bulb blocks and prevents direct glare light rays. Some light rays 26 from the source 16 are at an upward and rearward angle, and are not reflected by the non reflective surf ace 23 because it is absorbed by its dark color or because it passes through a transparent truncated section 21 and becomes trapped or absorbed by the vehicle hood or other structural members. If, however, the rays 26 were reflected at surface 23, they would follow a path 27, be re reflected by surface 12 into a path 28, and again be re reflected by surface 24 if reflective into a path 29 frontwardly and upwardly from the headlamp thus causing undesired glare to onc d g motorists. There would be an infinite number of such undesired glare rays, reflecting at diverging angles, i.e., fanning out and scattering from the surfaces 23 and 24 and causing a widespreading projected beam of light having an undesirable upward glare component.Also, light rays reaching the front region of the lower surface 24 directly from the source 16 wsuld, if this surface were reflective, be reflected with a glare producing upward component. Tb. invention, by providing non reflective characteristics at the truncated sections 21, 22, prevents or substantially reduces the glare light. Wuseral 31 indicates a light ray reflected by the inner surface of the bulb 14 in an upward and rearward direction similar to the ust described ray 26, and which is not reflected by the truncated areas 21 and 22 if these areas were reflective, the ray 31 and others generally in the same direction would be multiply reflected and emerge as glare rays similar to ray 29. The sides 32, 33 of the reflector can be truncated, if desired, to reduce the horizontal width, and may be either reflective or non reflective because sideways but not upward reflected rays are relatively unimportant,Also, the light bulb 14, altbough shown horizontal, can be vertical or at another angle. Vith suitable redesign, the headlamp can be turned over so that area 22 is the top and area 21 is the bottom, the opaque coating area 18, if provided, being relocated on the bulb to block direct frontward light rays that would have an upward component through the front of the headlamp. While preferred embodiments and modifications of the invention have been shown and described, various other embodiments and modifications thereof will become apparent to persons skilled in the art and will fall within the scope of the invention as defined in the following clams.
