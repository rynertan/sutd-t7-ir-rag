# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DRIVING TAKE UP ELEMENTS FOR PALLETIZABLE LOAD UNITS, PARTICULARLY FOR STORAGE AND TRANSPORT INSTALLATIONS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
A method and apparatus 1 for driving take up elements 7 for palletizable load units 4 , which are intended to effect cycles of movement each including at least a first and a second horizontal movement in opposite directions from each other, with a vertical movement in between. These movements are driven so as to follow each other without intermediate stoppages and with a continuous and substan tially harmonic variation of the velocity and acceleration of the take up elements 7 . The apparatus 1 includes a linkage 10, 12 interposed between the take up elements 7 and the motor 13 for driving their horizontal movement, and cam means 24, 25 driven by the motor 13 for driving the vertical movement.
