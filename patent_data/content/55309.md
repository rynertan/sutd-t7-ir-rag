# Method of producing packages of a predetermined weight.

## Abstract
The packages are weighed at a first weigh station 16, 17 to determine whether they fall within a predetermined weight range or whether they fall within predetermined limits either side of said predetermined weight range. If the latter the packages are then fed to a second weight station 23, 28 at which they are again weighed and according to the weight ascertained there, an operator is given an indication usually by lights as to the exact number of make weight pieces both in number and size which have to be added or subtracted to the package in order that the package shall then fall accurately within the predetermined weight range. The second weigh station 23, 28 is desirably controlled by a computer which is supplied with basic information such as a the stated package weight b the average number of articles per pack c the predetermined make weight ranges and other factors.
