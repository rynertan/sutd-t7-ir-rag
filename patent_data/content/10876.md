# Osmotically driven active agent dispenser.

## Abstract
An osmotically driven dispenser 10 for dispensing an osmotically effective active agent composition 17 into a water containing environment comprising a water insol uble two layer laminated wall of an inner semipermeable lamina 14 and an outer microporous or hydrogel lamina 12 , the wall defining an inner compartment 16 , an osmotically effective active agent composition 17 con tained within the compartment 16 , and an outlet pas sageway 15 through the wall from which the active agent composition 17 is dispensed characterized in that the wall includes a third layer 13 of a water soluble compo sition located between the inner semipermeable lamina 14 and the outer microporous or hydrogel lamina 12 and the passageway 15 extends through the inner semi permeable lamina 14 from the compartment 16 to the third layer 13 .
