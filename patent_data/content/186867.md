# COFFEE OR TEA FILTER POUCH AND PROCESS OF PRODUCING IT

## Abstract
A coffee or tea filter pouch for the production of filtered coffee, or resp., tea includes two layers of a water permeable filter material, which are joined at the edges to form a package containing a coffee powder or resp., tea leaves. The filter mate rial is unilaterally heatsealable, and the two layers 2, 3 of the filter material are joined at the edges 4, 5, 6, 7 through a heat sealing seam. The heatsealing seam along the upper edge 7 is adapted to be pulled open or torn open, or else the two layers 2, 3 are joined together at the upper edge 7 through a folded layer of said unilaterally heatsealable filter material, said folded layer being inserted, with the folded edge pointing downwardly and with the heatsealable side being directed out wardly, into the upper region of the filter pouch 1 , and the gusset insert 10 is heatsealed to the two layers 2,3 of the filter material at the upper edge 7 and in the region of the side edges 4, 5 . The filter pouch 1 may be produced by a continuous or an intermittent process from two webs or from a single web of said filter material.
