## Description
A semiconductor laser is used as a light source for recording and reproduction in an optical information recording reproducing apparatus. Semiconductor lasers have a large variation in light emitting output due to a change in ambient temperature. In general, a threshold current I T₀ 100 150 K, Therefore, the output light from the semiconductor laser is ordinarily monitored by a photo sensitive device such as a pin diode or the like and is fed back to a drive circuit of the semiconductor laser and a control system is constituted, thereby regulating the output light of the semiconductor laser. In optical information recording reproducing apparatuses, it is necessary in recording mode to modulate the output light of the semiconductor laser by a recording signal. However, the level of the output light for recording is a few times larger than the level of the output light for reproduction and also the output light for recording is modulated at a high frequency, so that it is difficult to constitute the control system by feeding back the monitored signal for recording. Therefore, the output light is not modulated by the recording signal, but the voltage of the control system obtained with the output light DC level for reproduction is held and a predetermined output light level which is needed for recording is further added to this held voltage and thereby controlling and regulating the output light to stabilize it upon recording. Fig. 1 shows a practical example. A reference numeral 1 denotes a semiconductor laser 2 is a pin diode to monitor an output light of the semiconductor laser 3 an operational amplifier to generate a control voltage of the control system 4a and 4b trensistors to modulate a current flowing through the semiconductor laser 1 by a recording signal 5 6 a variable resistor for allowing a reference voltage to be generated to set an output light for reproduction and 7a to 7d analog gate switches. Only the switches 7a and 7b are turned on in reproduction mode, while only the switches 7c and 7d are turned on in recording mode. A switching between the recording and reproduction is performed by controlling the ON OFF of the analog switches 7a to 7d by a recording gate signal 8. The monitor signal detected by the pin diode 2 is compared with the reference voltate upon reproduction and the control voltage is outputted by the operational amplifier 3. This control voltage is inputted to a sample hold circuit 9 only for reproduction. Since the analog gate switches 7a and 7b are turned off for recording, the control system for the feedback of the monitor signal is disabled. On one hand, the analog gate switches 7c and 7d are turned on and the semiconductor laser is driven using the control voltage which was sampled and held by the sample hold circuit 9 immediately before the recording. Further, a current source which is constituted by a transistor 10 is enabled to secure the output light level which is needed for recording. Fig. 2 shows the relation between the forward current flowing through the semiconductor laser 1 in the arrangement of Fig. 1 and the output light level. P Fig. 2 shows the operation mode such that when the ambient temperature changes to T , the gradient K changes and the output light level for recording can not be stably controlled. Specifically speaking, the forward current becomes 1 with the change of threshold current I GB A 1 539 624 discloses a semiconductor laser drive circuit according to the preamble of claim 1. As described above, when considering a wide temperature range and a time dependent change of the semiconductor laser as well, the semiconductor laser drive circuit which has been conventionally proposed cannot stably control the output light for recording. The present invention intends to solve the problems in the foregoing conventional example and it is an object of the invention to provide a semiconductor laser drive circuit of a simple arrangement for controlling the output light level constant even in the recording mode of modulating an output light of a semiconductor laser by a recording signal. The semiconductor laser drive circuit according to the invention is defined in claim 1. According to this invention, in the recording mode of modulating the output light of the semiconductor laser by the recording signal, a monitor signal responsive to the output light of the semiconductor laser is detected by a photo sensitive device this monitor signal is inputted to a peak hold circuit to hold the peak value of the input signal a differential compensation control signal is obtained from an output of the peak hold circuit and is fed back and thereby constituting an optical control system a control is made such that the output light of the semiconductor laser becomes a certain constant amplitude modulation signal the output light can be stably controlled over a wide temperature range even if the characteristic of the semiconductor laser changes with an elapse of time and this semiconductor laser drive circuit can be realized in a simple circuit arrangement. The above and other objects and features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the following accompanying drawings Fig. 3 is a diagram showing an arrangement of a semiconductor laser drive circuit of one embodiment in the present invention. In Fig. 3, the similar parts and components as those in the arrangement of the conventional example shown in Fig. 1 are designated by the same reference numerals. Figs 4a to 4e are diagrams showing signal waveforms in respective portions of To realize a rapid switching from the recording mode to the reproduction mode, the analog gate switch 7e is provided and the output of the wideband operational amplifier is bypassed, and upon reproduction, the peak value holding state of the peak hold circuit is released by controlling the recording gate signal. Since the output impedance of the wideband operational amplifier 11 is low, the charges stored in the capacitor 16 rapidly discharge through the analog gate switch 7e. Therefore, in case of switching from the recording mode to the reproduction mode, the differential control signal which is inputted to the operational amplifier 3 is rapidly switched from the peak value voltage of the peak hold circuit to the voltage of the DC level for the reproduction mode. As described above, by providing the analog gate switch 7e to bypass the output of the amplifier 11, the control of the light output which is made stable in both recording and reproduction modes and in which the switching speed is high can be realized by the simple arrangement. Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the characteristic of the light output control in this embodiment. This graph shows the relation between the output light level of the semiconductor laser when the ambient temperature changes from T to T and the forward current. As will be understood from this graph, in association with the change in ambient temperature of the semiconductor laser, the threshold current changes from I In the semiconductor laser drive circuit of the present invention, upon recording where the output light of the semiconductor laser is modulated by the recording signal, the monitor signal responsive to the output light of the semiconductor laser is detected by the photo sensitive device, this monitor signal is inputted to the peak hold circuit for holding the peak value of the input signal, the differential control signal is obtained from the output of the peak hold circuit and is fed back, and thereby constituting the optical control system. A control is made such that the output light of the semiconductor laser becomes a certain constant modulation amplitude. Even upon recording as well, the output light can be stably controlled within a wide temperature range even if the characteristic of the semiconductor laser changes with an elapse of time, and also this drive circuit can be realized by a simple arrangement.
