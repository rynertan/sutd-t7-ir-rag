## Description
CEPHALEXIN AMIDE COMPLEX, PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTIONAND USE IN CEPXALEXIN MONOHYDRATE PRODUCTION This invention provides a novel complex of Cephalexin 7 ss D a aminophenylacetamido 3 methyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acidi and formamide. The complex in crystalline form has a weight content of 72 of Cephalexin and 28 of formamide. It is stable at room temperature and may be dried to a constant weight at 300 to 500. C. In accordance with the invention, the Cephalexinformamide complex may be produced by treatment of Cephalexin with formamide and, in a preferred embodiment, the Cephalexin is produced in known manner by silylating 7 p amino 3 methyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid 7 ADCA , and acylating the resulting silyl derivative. The process may, for example, be carried out by silylating 7 ADCA in known manner, employing such silylating agents as trichloromethylsilane, hexamethyldisilazane, dichlorodimethylsilane, triphenylchlorosilane, hexaphenyl disilazane, N trimethylsilyl acetamide, N,O bis trimethyl silylacetamide or bis trimethylsilylurea. Preferably, the silylation is effected with hexamethyldisilazane in methylene chloride. In general, it is preferred to employ slightly more than 1 equivalent of the silylating agent based on the amount of 7 ADCA so that the O monosilylated 7 ADCA derivative results. The alylation step may also be effected in conventional manner employing, for example, D phenylglycyl chloride hydrochloride and carrying out the process in the presence of anHCl acceptor, for example a heterocyclic compound containing a 5 membered heterocyclic ring, having 2 or 3 hetero atoms, at least one of which is nitrogen, the ring optionally being substituted by one or more alkyl groups. The process is suitably effected in a low boiling, organic solvent. Suitable heterocyclic HCl acceptors include dialkylthiazoles, dialkylisoxazoles, and dialkyloxazoles, e.g.2,4 dimethylthiazole, 2,5 dimethylthiazole, 4,5 dimethylthiazole, 3,5 dimethylisoxazole, 4,5 dimethylisoxazole and 2,5 dimethyloxazole, as well as 3,4,5 triethylisoxazole, 3,4 dimethyl 1,2,5 oxadiazole, 3,5 dimethylpyrazole and 1,3,5 trimethylpyrazole. These materials have the advantagc over HCl acceptors preferred in the art, e.g. N,N dimethylaniline and pyridine, of lower toxicity and better watersolubility. After the acylation step, the reaction mixture is optionally filtered and organic solvent is suitably removed.The residue is then preferably taken up in a formamide water mixture preferably 95 58 . Upon adjusting the pH to 6.5 to 7.0 with a base, the Cephalexin formamide complex crystallises out. Preferred bases include aqueous ammonia, triethyl amine, tributylamine, sodium or potassium carbonate or dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The Cephalexin formamide complex of the invention is useful in the production and isolation of Cephalexin, in particular Cephalexin monohydrate. Cephalexin is a valuable, orally administrable antibiotic, produced by acylation of 7 ADCA or a derivative thereof, e.g. a salt or an ester thereof, to introduce the D a aminophenylacetyl group. For this purpose, the amino group in D phenylglycine derivative employed is customarily protected to avoid undesired side reactions. Suitable protecting groups include tert. butoxycarbonyl or 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl groups. However, the use of such protecting groups necessitates a further step after the acylation reaction to split off the protecting group. The protection of the amino group by protonation, i.e. by using for example D phenylglycyl chloride in the form of an acid addition salt, in particular the hydrochloride, avoids the need for a subsequent disprotection step.However, it does lead to a series of disadvantages in the known methods for effecting the acylation, for example in an organic solvent and in the presence of an HCl acceptor. For example, normally the reaction does not run to completion so that theCephalexin product is contaminated with unreacted 7 ADCA and or is obtained in lower yields. In addition, under these conditions, the phenylglycyl chloride hydrochloride, while protected to a large extent, nevertheless may take part in a series of side reactions, for example conversion to phenylglycine or self acylation to phenylglycylphenylglycine. One proposed method for dealing with these problems involves conversion of the Cephalexin after the acylation step into suitable easily crystallisable complex or solvate from which the final product can be obtained in economical yields and pharmaceutically acceptable quality. For example,Austrian patent 314,731 Eli Lilly and W. German DOS 2,432,485 Glaxo describe a process for producing N,Ndimethylformamide and acetamide complexes of Cephalexin.The antibiotic is then released from these complexes, by dissolution in mineral acid and adjustment to pH with a base, either as the monohydrate form or, after drying, as the water free product. By this method, the Cephalexin is freed from 7 ADCA and other impurities. These processes have the disadvantage, however, that they employ carcinogenic substances or substances convertible to carcinogens, in particular dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide. In the industrial pr6 ducation of orally administered antibiotics, it is advantageous to avoid the use of such materials and, in particular, compounds which convert to dimethylamine, which chemically or metabolically is easily activated to the highly dangerous carcinogen N nitroso dimethylamine. In addition, these known processes employ, during the acylation step, toxic bases such as N,N dimethylaniline and pyridine, which are difficult to remove from the end product. The present invention provides a process for the production and isolation of Cephalexin, not involving the use of toxic materials, namely a process for the production of Cephalexin monohydrate comprising the step of converting the Cephalexin resulting from the acylation step to the Cephalexin formam ide complex of the invention and converting this toCephalexin monohydrate. More particularly, the present invention provides processes for the production 6f Cephalexin monohydrate comprising a suspending a Cephalexin formamide complex in water, for example at a temperature of or under 400C, adding an appropriate amount of a mineral acid so that a sol ution is formed, adjusting the pH of the solution to 6.5 and, conveniently, seeding the solution, whereby the Cephalexin monohydrate crystallises out or b dissolving a Cephalexin formamide complex in a water miscible organic carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid, at, for example, room temperature, diluting the sol ution with an excess, e.g. a three fold excess, of its own volume of water, seeding the solution, and allowing the Cephalexin monohydrate to crystallise out, preferably at room temperature or below or c mixing a Cephalexin formamide complex with at least 50 based on its own dry weight of water but insufficient water to form a solution and stirring the mixture at a temperature of 500 to 600C. The crystal suspension is thereby converted into the monohydrate which may be filtered off or d dissolving a Cephalexin formamid,e complex, in an aqueous alkali, e.g. caustic soda or potash, ammonia or triethylamine, adjusting the pH of the solution to the isoelectric point of Cephalexin monohydrate by addition of acid, e.g. hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid, whereby the Cephalexin monohydrate crystallises out. The Cephalexin monohydrate in this manner possesses a high degree of purity, in particular it is far freer from 7 ADCA than, for example, the product obtained via the dimethylformamide complex of the prior art. Furthermore, the use of the formamide complex of the invention permits the avoidance, if desired, of the prior art process of dissolving in acid, heating and precipitation with a base. Furthermore, process a possesses the additional advantage over prior art processes that, because of the lower precipitation temperature, higher yields are obtained, while processes b , c and d are more economical and ecologically more acceptable than prior art processes. It has also been found that the use, during the acylation step, of the heterocyclic bases described, results in a higher yield and quality of the formamide complex and, therefore the final monohydrate end product. The following Examples, in which all the temperatures are in OC, illustrate the invention.
