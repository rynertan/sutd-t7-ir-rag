# Control lever assembly.

## Abstract
A control lever is attached to a hub 30, 32 rotatable in a housing 12 . A cam 50 is rotatable about the same axis as the hub and includes an edge cam 60 controlling a spring loaded radial arm 90 . In the illustrated position, the head 96 of the arm arrests a centering spring 110 for returning the control lever to its neutral position automatically on release. The arm 90 also carries a detent roller for engagement with notches 38, 42 for holding the control lever in a displaced position. Slight clockwise rotation of the cam 50 by a reversible electric motor 80 , gear 84 and rack 62 on the cam, causes the detent roller to disengage while leaving the arm head 96 engaged between the ends 112 of the centering spring 110 . 90 DEG rotation clockwise, however, disengages the detent and disengages the arm from the spring. Moreover a face cam shifts the cam 50 axially to compress a multiplate friction brake providing for a friction held mode of the control lever.
