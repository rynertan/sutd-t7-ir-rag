# A method of producing a magnetic coating composition.

## Abstract
A method for producing a magnetic recording com position involves preparing an aqueous dispersion of mag netic particles and colloidal silica particles, the pH of this dispersion being adjusted so that the magnetic and silica particles are electrostatically attracted to and bond to each other, removing the water from the dispersion, and dispers ing the silica coated magnetic particles in an organic liquid binder system for application to a recording substrate.
