# Headbox trailing element.

## Abstract
A paper machine trailing element 11 for use in a slice in a headbox wherein the trailing element is formed of laminations with a bead at the upper end for anchoring the element 11 in a slice chamber with the bead formed of laminations with fibers on the outer surface in the machine direction and in the cross machine direction within the bead so that the element 11 has a greater stiffness in the machine direction at the upstream end 18 with the element 11 tapering to a thin tip 19 at the downstream end and the downstream end formed of laminations 24, 27 with fibers extending in the cross machine direction for a greater stiffness to minimize instability.
