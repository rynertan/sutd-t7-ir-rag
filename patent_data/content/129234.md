# Electrophotographic elements having barrier layers of crosslinked polymers.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic element comprising a conduc tive layer, a photoconductive layer and a barrier layer bet ween the conductive layer and the photoconductive layer characterized in that the barrier layer comprises a polymer ized crosslinked monomer having an aliphatic or aromatic group comprising at least one α,β ethylenically unsaturated carbonyl containing substituent is disclosed.
