# A regulatory glycoprotein for immune response in the production of T cell growth factor.

## Abstract
A cell mediated immune response system glycoprotein having a molecular weight of about 90,000 and having at least one sialic acid moeity as a biologically active site is disclosed. The glycoprotein is specifically bound by wheat germ agglutinin and also by the hydrophobically binding ligand Blue A Cibacron Blue F3G A , but does not bind to lysine. The glycoprotein is a necessary cofactor with Interleukin 1 in the biosynthesis of T cell growth factor I1 2 . A process for producing a serum free and mitogen free I1 2 in vitro by adding the glycoprotein to a serum free and mitogen free I1 1 preparation, and a method for producing the serum free and mitogen free I1 1 is also described. A chemically defined T cell growth culture medium containing the new glycoprotein as the only protein substance is used in the above process, and also provides a means for studying regulation of T cell lymphocyte growth. Inhibitors for the formation of T cell blasts in cell mediated immunological response provide a powerful new tool for preventing host graft rejection. These inhibitors are alkylating agents for serine esterase enzymes which have been found to be involved in the cell mediated immunological response system which generates natural killer NK cells, the latter being responsible for graft rejection in a host.

## Description
A retilatory glycoprotein for immune response in the roduction of T cell Froth factorThis invention relates to a newly discovered blood serum protein whcb is part of tne T cell regulating sy te to the use of this novel protein in the production of a serum free and mitogen ree preparation containing Interleukin I, and a serum free and mitogenfree preparation containing T cell growth factor to a chemically defined T cell growth culture medium containing the novel protein as the only protein and, to the novel protein in a purified form.A serum free, mitogen free T cell growth factor Inter leukin 2 or 11 2 has been described in co pendingEuropean Patent Application No. 81304560.6 entitled ASERUM FREE AND MITOGEN FREE T CELL GROWTH FACTOR ANDPROCESS FOR MAKING SAME and early published underNo. 0049611A2. The disclosure of this prior Applicat ion is incorporated herein in its entirety by the reference thereto.The preparation of the T cell growth factor described in the prior Application includes a step of stimulating isolated lymphocytes e.g. peripheral mononuclear blood cells in the presence of serum and a mitogen such as phytohemagglutinin A ERA . In fact, all known published literature on the production of lymphokines from lymphocytes reports the step of contacting the lymphocytes with mitogen in the presence of blood serum, added as a supplement to the cuture medium.While such procedures produce I1 2 in significant yields, the presence of serum has the drawbacks referred to in the above mentioned prior Application, namely the presence of numerous proteins which may mask the true effect of 11 2 allergic and anaphylactic reactions in patients repeatedly given injections of serum containing preparations and, the inability to concentrate serum containing preparations since the serum will precipitate and plug the pores of the filters used for this purpose. Despite these drawbacks it had always been presumed that the presence of serum was essential for the production and maintenance of growing T cell lines by the T cell growth factor 11 2 .However, it has now been able to show that serum free and mitogen free 11 2 preparations can be used to maintain growing T cell lines, and thereby provide a means for combatting tumor growth.Nevertheless, the procedure described in the priorApplication which required the lymphocyte stimulating step in the presence of serum was somewhat cumbersome in requiring the essentially complete removal of the serum prior to incubating the stimulated cells in a serum free, mitogen free liquid culture medium. The idea has now been conceived that it might be possible to eliminate completely the use of serum in the stimulation of the lymphocytes. In order to test this idea, it was first attempted to test the effect of specific fractions of human serum which had been separated in narrow molecular weight ranges by gel partition chromatography. Quite surprisingly, it was found that only the molecular weight fraction of the serum in the range of from about 60,000 to 130,000 was capable of inducing production of I1 2. However, none of the known blood serum proteins in this molecular weight range, e.g. transferrin, haptoglobin, albumin, etc., were found to be capable of inducing the production of I1 2 in bioassay tests in culture medium This observation led to the conclusion that an unidentified blood serum factor must be present in the serum and must be necessary for the stimulation of lymphocytes to produce T cell growth factor also known as TC9F or I1 2 . In fact, such previously unidentified and unknown blood serum factor has now been isolated and provides the basis of the present invention.According to the present invention, a previously 1menolFm unidentified blood serum protein glycoprotein having a molecular weight of about 90,000 Daltons and having at least one sialic acid N acetyl neuraminic acid residue is provided. This protein is further characterized by its relative heat stability it loses less than onehalf of its biological activity when heated at 800cm for 30 minutes and by its strong affinity to lectins, primarily wheat germ agglutinin WGA , and to hydrophobically binding ligands such as Blue A, which are commercially readily available but no specific binding to lysine.In another aspect the present invention provides a process for producing serum free, mitogen free Interleukin 1 11 1 also known as lymphocyte activating factor IAF and serum free, mitogen free I1 2, by incubating peripheral mononuclear blood PBL cells in a serum free liquid tissue culture medium to remove residual serum proteins on the surfaces of the PBt cells, activating the incubated cells with a mitogen, washing the activated cells with a sterile liquid to remove the mitogen from the cells and conditioning the serum free mitogenfree activated cells in a liquid tissue culture medium to produce a serum free, mitogen free Interleukin 1 Il 1 contacting the I1 l containing liquid tissue culture medium with the novel blood serum glycoprotein of this invention and, inc bating the cells in the presence of Il 1 and the novel blood serum glycoprotein to induce synthesis of 11 2 and to transfer the 11 2 T cell growth factor from the cells to the liquid phase of the tissue culture medium to thereby produce a serumfree, mitogen free 11 2. In still another aspect, this invention provides a chemically defined liquid tissue culture growth medium for growing lymphocytes in vitro. The medium includes the conventional cell nutrient and, as the only constituent of the medium, the novel blood serum protein of this invention. This tissue culture growth medium can then be used to grow T cells in the absence of blood serum. Such a medium is beneficial for studying regulation of T lymphocyte growth in a chemically defined surrounding, and offers the advantage of being less dangerous with respect to hepatitis than media containing human whole serum.A still further aspect of this invention relates to a process for inhibiting the in vivo production of natural killer cells by interfering with the cell mediated immunological system response mechanism to invasion by foreign bodies, particularly grafts of tissue or other organs. According to this process a serine alkylating agent is used to prevent blastogenic transformation ofT cells to T blasts.The invention will now be explained in greater detail by the following description and specific embodiments and with the aid of the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a graph of light transmission against elution volume for separation of human blood serum on a Oephadex G 200 chromatogra L column, and also showing the biologically active peak for the novel blood serum glycoprotein of this invention and also the peaks for transferrin and haptoglobin Figure 2 is a graph of light transmission against elution volume for the separation of the biologically active fractions Nos. 75 100 obtained in Example 1 after refractionation on a Sephadey G 150 chromatography column Figure 3 is a graph showing the results of chromatofocussing the biologically active fractions Nos. 75 100 obtained in Example 1 in terms of biological and immunological activity and,Figure 4 is a graph showing the results obtained inExample 7 for the production of Interleukin 2 in the presence and in the absence of the novel blood serum glycoprotein of this invention.It has been demonstrated in the literature and also shown in the data reported in the above mentioned PatentApplication, that tumor patients are defective in the ability of their cellular immune system cell mediated immunity to produce the T cell growth factor 11 2 necessary for production of natural killer cells which can attack and destroy tumors. Therefore, if the natural killer cells in tumor patients can be stimulated into activity, it should be possible to stop the growth of tumor cells.According to current theory of the cell mediated immunological response mechanism to invasion of the host by a mitogen, the mitogen activates a macrophage subpopulation of lymphocytes. to produce I1 l which in turn stimulates a T cell subpopulation, presumably T helper cells, to produce 11 2. Erie latter is identified biologically by its ability to support the growth of permanently growing T cell lines.Contrary to this current belief, it has now been found that production of I1 2 depends not only on the interaction of T lymphocytes with Il 1 but also with a previously unknown unidentified protein found in blood plasma sera from humans as well as from other mammals, such as horse sera and bovine sera. This protein has a molecular weight about 90,000. Thus, when Il 1 is brought into contact with lymphocytes in the absence of serum, or with serum from which the molecular weight fraction range of 86,000 to 94,000 has been eliminated by fractionation, I1 2 production is not observed. As far as is aware, this observed phenomenon has never been reported or suggested in the literature.In order to determine whether this comitogenic blood serum factor was one of the known blood serum proteins in the molecular weight range where the biological activity was found, a series of bioassay tests was carried out by adding the known proteins albumin, transferrin, plasminogen and haptoglobin to an Il 1 conditioned serum free cell culture medium. None of these known proteins was capable of forming T cell blasts or sustaining T cell lines. Accordingly, it was concluded that none of these proteins was capable of interacting with Il 1 on the T cell lymphocytes to produce I1 2 11 2 by definition is capable of sustaining the growth of T cell lines . Nle unknown comitogenic factor was determined to be a protein by virtue of the fact that the biological activity of the cor,itogenic factor containing blood serum fraction was destroyed by treatment with trypsin.Since trypi only deactivates proteins by destroying the peptic bonds , the unknown factor must be a protein.Further investigations have revealed the presence of at least one sialic acid residue N acetyl neuraminic acid . Thus, treatment of the novel comitogenic protein factor with neuraminadase enzyme resulted in a loss of biological activity.By the reaction of the comitogenic protein factor with various lectins, it has been further identified as a glycoprotein, although the specific sugar fraction has not yet been identified.Since the comitogenic glycoprotein was originally found in human blood sera, it has been given the acronymPHILIP Plasmatic Human Interleukin Inducing Protein.Accordingly, the name PHILIP may be used to identify the previously unknown and unrecognized blood serum protein which can be characterised by its physioco chemical properties molecular weight of about 90,000 D glycoprotein at least one sialic acid residue strong adherence binding to lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin, andBlue A and, relative heat stability and by its biological activity in the presence of Interleukin 1 serumfree and mitogen free it will induce peripheral mononuclear blood cells lymphocytes T cells to produceT cell growth factor I1 2 which forms T cell blasts and supports the growth of T cell lines alternatively, in a serum free system, in the presence of mitogen such as ERA and peripheral mononuclear blood cells, PHILIP will induce the production of 11 2 and T cell blastogenesis.In the latter case, the PKA first induces the pro macrophage cells to produce Il 1 which, with the coaction of PHILIP, induces a second cell fraction, presumably T helper cells, to produce I1 2.At this point, it should be emphasised that the mechanism by which PHILIP functions to cooperate with Il 1 and the T cells to produce 11 2 has not been elucidated. It is generally believed, but has not yet been proven conslusively, that the subpopulation of Cells known as T helper cells produce 11 2. The production of an Il 1 preparation which is serumfree and mitogen free iE an important and novel aspect of this invention. Such an Il 1 preparation can be used directly, or after being concentrated which is made possible by being serum free , for the production of 11 2. The serum free, mitogen free 11 1 can be prepared from isolated adherent pro macrophage cells or directly from peripheral mononuclear blood cells pew . Do isolate the adherent pro macrophage cells, the following well known technique can be used. Peripheral mononuclear blood cells are first isolated from the blood by the density gradient technique. For example, the blood is layered into a tube containing a high density polymeric solution, such as the commercially available Fcoll hypaque, and centrifuged. The P3L cells are collected above the polymeric solution and carefully removed. The Ficoll hypaque solution is slightly toxic, so the removal must be done very carefully. The so obtained PSi cells are washed several times, usually three times, with a sterile solution, to ensure complete removal of the Ficoll bypague solution.The washing is accomplished by gently suspending the cells in the sterile solution and centrifuging to again separate the cells from the solution. Low centrifuge speed and time e.g. 303 x G for ten minutes are used to avoid breakage or destruction of the cells. RoswellPark Memorial Institute RANI 1640 is a commercially available sterile solution which can be used for this purpose, and also as the liquid culture medium. Machines are presently available for the automatic separation of mononuclear cells from blood, and such machines are advantageously used when available.The PBL cells are then placed in plastic Petri dishes and incubated for about 1 hour at about 37 C. The promacrophage cells are adherent to plastic and adhere to the walls of the Petri dishes. The non adherent cells are washed off by spraying with sterile solution, e.g. REMI 1640. The adherent cells are removed from thePetri dish, and a rubber policeman can conveniently be used for this purpose.The recovered pro macrophage cells, after being counted usually about 3 x 106 cells per ml are used , are incubated for from about 18 to 24 hours at about 3700 using a non supplemented liquid culture medium, such as R2MI 1640. Fresh culture medium can be added to or replace used culture medium every few hours if desired. By nonsupplemented is meant that no mitogenic substances or blood serum is added to the culture. All incubation steps in this invention are carried out under a C02 about 5 15 atmosphere, and at a temperature of about 57 C, unless otherwise noted.The purpose of this preliminary incubation step is to remove any serum proteins which may have been present on the cell membrane surfaces. Since the cell membranes are regenerated about once every eight hours the membranes will turn over about 2 or S times during this incubation period.When using the PBL cells without separation of the adherent pro macrophage cells, the PBL cells can be used directly incubated under the same conditions as described above to remove any proteins which may be present on the surface membrane of the cells. The cells are now ready to be activated for the production of Il 1. Activation of the cells is accomplished by contacting the cleaned cells in the liquid culture medium with a mitogen. Phytobemagglutinin L Ft is preferably used for this purpose although other lectin type mitogens, such as concanavalin A Con A Fscherichia coli lipopolysaccharide iPS and pokeweedmitogen POM can also be used.An important feature of the invention is that the mitogen iE only left in contact with the cells for a short period of time, preferebly about 4 hours although longer times up te about 12 hours can be used. Since the cells are activated or stimulated for and acutally begin production of Il i during this short time period, the mitogen is removed from the cells without significantly limiting the production of Il 1.The washing can be accomplished as described above for removing the Ficoll hypaque solution, i.e. centrifuging the cell suspension, adding the cells to fresh sterile solution, and repeating this process about 3 times.The supernatants can be saved for future cell stimulations or for recovery of Il 1 or PHA.The activated cells can then be conditioned by incubating the cells in a fresh non supplemented RPMI 1640 for about 12 to 30 hours, preferably about 15 to 26 tours and most preferably about 14 to 24 hours. Generally, the cells are used in a ccncentratior, of about x 06 cells per ml of culture medium.A serum free lectin free II it obtained in the super blatant. The presence of Il 1 is confirmed by known chemical and biological characteristics of Interleukin 1. Thus,the product has been shown by the results of contacting with protease and lectins to be a non clyco group i.e. sugar free protein, and by gel filtration chromatograph to have a molecular weight of approximately 5,000. The biological characteristics of the Il 1 preparation are also consistent with the definition of in the presence of blood serum T cell blastogenesis is induced and, it is not able to support the growth of a permanently growing T cell line.In the present invention biological activity is determined by a standardized bioassay test which is carried out as follows Peripheral mononuclear blood cells which have been isolated and subjected to preliminary incubation to remove serum protein and macrophage cells adhered to the surface of the lymphocyte cells, as described above, are suspended in R2MI 1640 to provide a cell density of one million cells per ml of culture medium.The supernatant whose biological activity is being assayed is deposited in the first row of a microtiter plate. The second row of wells is filled with REMI to provide a concentration which is one half that of the first row. Similarly, the third and each succeeding row are each filled with supernatant diluted to a con centr ion which iE one half of the preceding row. As a result, a microtiter plate iE obtained wherein a dilution factor of 1 2 is obtained as one moves from the top towards the bottom of the plate.A measured number of the mononuclear cells which have been preliminarily incubated is added to each well in the microtiter plate. The growth of the cells as a result of stimulation by T cell growth factor Il 2 is monitored. In the case of bioassay for Il 1 it is further necessary to add serum or PHILIP to each well, since otherwise 11 2 production will not occur. Generally, serum is used from a human serum pool in an amount of 15 vol vol. Likewise, in the bioassay for the biological activity of PHILIP, either Mitogen PHA orInterleukin 1 serum free must be added to each well containing the isolated peripheral mononuclear blood cells.Significant activity is considered to be present in those titer rows where cell denisty has doubled at the end of seven days. The inverse of dilution for those rows is used as the meçsure of significant growth. The serum free lectin free I1 l preparation so obtained, after concentration if desired, is used to produceI1 2 by contacting lymphocytes in the presence of PRII lP. In terms of biological activity, PHILIP can be used directly after separation of the appropriate molecular weight fraction by, for example, gel chromatography for example by separation on a Sephadex G 150 or G 200 column Sephadex is a bead formed, dextran gel prepared by cross linking selected dextran fractions with epichlorhydrin Sephaaex is a trade mark of Pharmacia AB,Uppsala, Sweden . Alternatively the PHILIP containing serum fraction is dialyzed against RRG for about 24 hours, using membrane passing substances having molecular weights below about 10,000 to 15,000 prior to use.It is,however, preferred to use PHILIP after removal of other blood serum proteins contained in the PHILIP con taining fraction. Since PHILIP is highly adherent to various lectins, this property is utilized to purifyPHILIP by affinity chromatography using the lectin as the immobilized ligand to which the glycoprotein PHILIP is specifically but reversibly binding. Sepharose a bead formed agarose gel a trademarked product ofPharmacia AB, beads have been used as the insoluble matrix to which the ligand is immobilized. Among the ligands to which PHILIP is selectively binding areBlue A and wheat germ agglutinin WGA . Blue A Sepharose and WGA Sepharose are available from PharmaciaFine Chemicals AB.Wheat germ agglutinin is the preferred lectin, since other blood serum proteins of similar molecular weights, e.g. plasminogen, transferrin, and albumin, are either only weakly binding or non binding to WGA. In particular, the following affinities of blood serum proteins to various Sepharose type affinity column gel beads can be noted Lizard bound to SepharoseProtein Con A WGA Blue A Lysine PHILIP Plasminogen Transferrin Albumin Notes 85 of the protein is specifically bound partial specific binding non specific binding It can be seen from the above table that FRILIP can be easily separated from other blood serum proteins in the same molecular weight rage by affinity chromatograph using WGA Sepharose.The following procedure can be used.The biologically active fraction capable of inducingI1 2 production in the bioassay test recovered from aSephadex G200 column is incubated on a WGA Sepharose column at room temperature for about 1 hour. The column is then eluted with two buffers. In the first elution, a normal phosphate buffer pR 7.2 is used at a 10fold volume 100 ml buffer 10 ml WGA Sepharose . The first elution removes all proteins which are not specifically bound by WGA.The second elution is perfomred with the same phosphate buffer to which is added N acetyl D glucosamine NADG at about 20 mM NADG per liter of buffer. In the first step, a 5 fold volume is used 50 ml buffer 10 ml WGA Sepharose and this removes those proteins binding only weakly to WGA. In the second step, a 5 fold volume is again used to remove all proteins with high specific binding affinity to WGA. Accordingly, essentially purePHILIP can be obtained by the present invention.The present invention also provides a process fpr producing serum free and mitogen and lectin freeInterleukin 2 I1 2 or TCGF using PHILIP and the serumfree lectin free Il 1 prepar atqh previously described.According to this process, the serum free lectin free Il 1 preparation is mixed with a RHtLIP containing liquid culture medium e.g. MM 1640 preparation at a volumetric mixing ratio of from about 1 1 to 1 32, preferably from about 1 1 to 1 4 and most preferably about 1 1. The Eerum free lectin free Il 1 preparation can be used directly after the conditioning step without the Il 1 containing supernatant from the cells. In this case, these cells will be activated to produce I1 2. Alternatively, the supernatant can be collected by centrifugation or filtering and a fresh supply of isolated lymphocytes provided. It is also possible to supply additional isolated lymphocytes to the conditionedIl 1 culture medium without removing the cells already contained therein.Although a purified PHILIP preparation can be used, it is also possible to use a biologically active serum fraction from the gel chromatography separation. For example, if the separation is performed on a SephadexG 200 column the elution profile shows three peaks.Biological activity is found in the eluted fractions corresponding to the left shoulder of the third peak.Therefore, by collecting those fractions corresponding to the valley between the second and third peaks, through the top of the third peak, substantially all of the biologically active T cell regulating blood serum protein PHILIP will be recovered. These eluted fractions can then be concentrated by a factor of about 10fold corresponding nearly to the original concentration , by filtering through an appropriate filter such as Amicon YMIO. The concentrated serum is then dialyzed against the sterile liquid culture medium, e.g. Rm ll 1640. The amount of liquid culture medium to which thePHILIP containing serum fraction iE added need only be that amount which gives an equivalent biological activity as determined by the microtiter bioassay test described above as the Il 1 preparation.However, greater or lesser amounts can be used. This mixture is used to incubate isolated blood lymphocytes at standard tissue culture conditions 98 humidit7 7.5 C02, temperature 370C, for about 8 to 24 hours, and preferably about 8 to 18 hours.After conaitioning of the lymphocytes, specificallyT cells presumably T helper cells , by the incubation, the cells are separated from the culture medium as by centrifuging, for example. Some serum free or substantially serum free, depending on the source of PHILIP , and mitogen free T cell growth factor 11 2 will be present in the supernatant, since production of I1 2 can be expected to begin within a fer minutes to about 1 hour after initiation of incubation.The separated conditioned cells are repeatedly washed, for example 3 times, with fresh iEMI 1640 or other suitable liquid tissue culture medium. These cells can then be recycled for further conditioning. The biological activity of the resulting serum free and mitogen free I1 2 containing supernatant can be determined by the bioassay test described above.The liquid tissue culture medium to anich pure PHILIP has been added provides a useful chemically definedT cell growth culture medium which allows for a more precise study of the regulation of T lymphocyte growth, since the surroundings are not contaminated by other usually undefined proteins, as would be the case if whole serum was used. Purthermore, since human whole serum is not used, the danger of transmitting hepatitis virus is substantially eliminated. Thus, in addition to PHILIP the liquid tissue culture medium will contain liquid solvent, water, and conventional cell nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, glucose, saline and a buffer system.As described in the previously mentioned prior PatentApplications, the serum free and mitogen free T cell growth factor finds utility in numerous areas including, for example, diagnosis and treatment of immune deficiency in tumor patients. Another application of 11 2 described in the prior Applications is in the field of organ transplantation. In this regard it was described that I1 2 can be used as an antigen to develop antibodies in animals which could be used to inhibit graft rejection which is 2 well known cell mediated response.It has now been found, however, that it is possible to directly interfere with the ability of the immunological system to form natural killer cells by adding to the blood serum a serine alkylating agent. Although it is not entirely clear how the serine alkylating agent functions to prevent T cell blastogenesis, it is presently believed that the T cell growth factor I1 2 is a serine esterase enzyme which is inhibited from sending signals to the T effector cells, since the serine active site is blocked by the alkylating agent.In any case, whether the 11 2 is itself a serine esterase which is deactivated, or a serine esterase, is present in the serum as a comitogenic factor and this factor is prevented from cooperating with I1 2 to cause T cell blast formation, or whether the serine alkylating agent prevents biosynthesis of I1 2 or modifies the surface of the T effector cell or accomplishes its inhibitory effect in some other manner, it has nevertheless been demonstrated in numerous experiments that the serine alkyl ating agent inhibit blast transformation of pre incubated cells in the presence of I1 1 and PHILIP or 11 1 and whole blood serum from humane or other animals, e.g. bovine animals.Serine alkylating agents which can be used for T blast inhibition include diisopropylfluorophasphat e DFP , phenylmethylsulfonic fluoride and the like.It is interesting to note that plasminogen is a serine esterase. However, since it has already been found that 11 2 production and T cell blastogenesis will take place in the absence of plasminogen, it is clear that the serine alkylating agent s reaction with plasminogen is not responsible for the inhibition of blastogenesis. Example 1Gel partition chromatography on human blood serum Batches of 50 ml whole human serum are applied to aSephadex G 200 column 50 x 1200 from Pharmacia AB,Uppsala, Sweden equilibrated with 0.05 M phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M maC1 flowrate 60 ml hr, temperature 40C and 10 ml fractions were collected.The eluate was continuously monitored for 280 nm light absorption, and the results are shown in Figure 1.Peaks were observed at fraction numbers 12, 60, 100 and 120. PHILIP activity based on the bioassay test described in Example 3 below , was found in fractions nos. 75 100. Transferrin showed peak activity at fraction no. 95. Haptoglobin showed peak activity at fraction no. 54. Standard immunological tests were used to measure activity of transferrin and haptoglobin. The results of rt.fT afltionating pooled fractions 75 100 concentrated to 2r, ml against polyethyleneglycol on a Sephadex G 15 J column 20 x 900 mm 4 ml hr flow 0.05 M phosphate buffer containing 0. M NaCl is sbowm in Figure 2. 3 ml fractions were collected. The difiez ent biological activities can be clearly distinguished by the separated peaks.Further differentiation of the biological activity of PHILIP and transferrin and plasminogen is clearly demonstrated by Figure 3 showing chromatofocussing of the pooled fractions 75 100 from the G 200 column. Example 2Affinity chromatography of PHILIP 10 ml of PHILIP isolated by column chromatography as described in Example 1 is dialysed against 50 mMol l phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 before application to affinity columns. Columns containing WGA and Blue A and Con A are puchased from Pharmacia AS, Uppsala, Sweden. Covalent coupling of l lysine to sepharose 4E purchased fromPharmacia AB, Sweden is performed according to the method described by Deutsch and Mertz. Deutsch D..G., Hertz B.T, 1970 , Science vol. 170, pp. 1095 1096 .4 ml of PHILIP is layered into 2 ml of the affinity gels by slow addition, drop by drop. The column is incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes, whereafter the non adsorbed material is eluted by a 50 mMol l phosphate buffer, pX 7.0. A buffer volume of 50 ml is ued. Then, the adsorbed material is eluted by use of a 50 mMol l phosphate buffer, pR 7.0, containing N acetylD glucosamine, in a concentration of 200 mMol l in the case of WGA, alpha D mannopyranoside 200 mISol l in the case of Con A, epsilon amino capronic acid 200 iMol l in the case of lysine, and NADPH in the same concentration dissolved in the same buffer containing additionally 50 ethylene glycol and 20 aCl in the case ofBlue A. The eluted samples for each column two 50 ml portions are eluted are concentrated by polyethylene glycol to an end volume of 2 ml and dialysed against RPMI exhaustively. PHILIP is recovered from WGA sepharose in the second specific equate.Example 3Biological test for PHILIP activity 10 ml of the collected fraction from the column chromatography in Example 1 is dialyzed against 200 ml ofRPMI 1640. The dialysis is performed at 4 OC. Tnereafter, the preparation is sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 pm sterile filter which is available from different commercial sources and pipetted into microtiter plates which have been prefilled with RPMI 1640 to a volume of 20C pl well, so that in the first well of a row 200 Wl PHILIP iE mixed to the preexisting RMSI. After mixing, the volume of 200 pl is transferred to the second well of the row and so on, until a dilution of 1 32 has been achieved. 50,000 cells which have been incubated at 370C, 98 humidity and 10 CO2, in the serum free RPMI for 24 hours, are added in a volume of 20 50 pl to each well in the microtiter plate. EHA is added to a final concentration of 4pg ml to each well. The microtiter plate is incubated for 7 days under the conditions described above. On day 7, the plate is assayed for cell growth by counting the cells in an electronic cell counter. The dilution of the PHILIP preparation in which the cell number has doubled i.e. reached 100.000 is considered as the inverse of the titer.If, for example, the cell number bs increased to more than 100,000 in the dilution of 1 8, the titer in the preparation in considered to be 8.ExamPles 4Inactivation of PHILIP by trypsin and by neuraminidase enzymes a Inactivation by trypsin 10 ml samples of PHILIP obtained by column chrom atography as described in Example 1 are incubated at 37 0C in the presence of trypsin 4x crystallized obtained e.g. from SERVO Chemical Corp., Heidelberg, FRG concentration 0.1 w v in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 50 mMol l CaCl2. After 120 min. incubation, EDIA is added in a concentration of 0.01 mElol l, whereafter the samples are incubated again at 37 C for 120 min. After this second incubation, 10 mNol l DFP is added to the sample in order to inhibit the trypsin which is a serine protease. The sample is dialysed against 200 ml PPHI with a dialyzing membrane permeable to substances having molecular weight below about 15,000 and tested for biologic activity according to the test method described in Example 3. No biological activity was observed.b Inactivation by neuraminidase Neuraminidase isolated from Clostridium botulinus which is readily commercially available is coval ently coupled to BrCn activated Sepharose 4B manufactured by Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden, whereafter the gel is thoroughly rinsed in phos phate buffer. PHILIP samples as described in part a of this Example are layered onto the tops of the columns, with a gel content of 2 ml and incubated at 370C for 6 hours under sterile conditions. Thereafter, the sample is eluted by phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and dialysed against RESI 1640 as described above. The biological activity of PHILIP is determined according to the mcrotiter bioassay technique described above in Example 9. No biological activity was observed. Example 5Production of an Interleukin 1 preparation free of mitogen and serum proteins.a Preparation by use of adherent pro macrophages Blood lymphocytes are isolated as described in Example 1 of the above mentioned Patent Applic ations No. 81304550.6. After washing with sterile culture medium, the cells, usually 400 to 800 millions isolated per 400 ml whole blood, are incubated for 60 minutes at 370C in P1PI 1640 under standard cell culture conditions. The incubation is performed on a plastic Petri dish with a diameter of 15 cm. Such dishes are commer cially readily available. After incubation, the cell containing medium is poured off the dish and the dish with the adhering cells, usually 16 of the total cell number, is rinsed several times, usually 6, with RPMI 1640 to remove all non adher ent cells.Thereafter, the adherent cells are removed from the dish by use of a rubber policeman, counted, and suspended in a concentration of 3 millions ml in Ri t1 1640, and incubated for 24 hours at 370C under standard cell culture condit ions before further processing. After incubation, the cells are stimulated with PEA for 4 to 12 hours, preferably 4 to 8 hours and most preferably 4 hours, at a concentration of 4 Fg FSh ml of culture medium. The mA is then discarded, and the cells washed 3 times as described above, whereafter the cells are incubated in RPMI 1640 without supple ments for 18 24 hours, preferably 20 hours.The culture supernatants are collected, whereafter the cells can be stimulated again with mA if so desir ed. The stimulation may be repeated up to 3 times if so desired. The serum free culture supernatants can be concentrated on a YM 10 membrane as des in Example 1 of the Patent Application No.81304560.6, if desired. The Il 1 containing supernatants can be stored at 2O0until they are used.b Preparation by use of isolated blood lymphocytes without separation of adherent macrophages Blood lymphocytes are isolated as described above in this Example. The cells, after washing with REMI 1640, are incubated at 37 O under standard cell culture conditions for 24 hours. Thereafter, the cells are counted and stimulated with PHA at a concentration of 4 pg ml culture medium and a cell density of 3 millions ml as described above in this Example. All remaining steps of the prepar ation of Il 1 are the same as those mentioned above in this Example. Example 6Biological test for Interleukin 1 activity.Interleukin 1, free of lectin and sera, prepared as described in Example 5 is filtered sterile and tested for its biologic activity as follows RPMI 1640 is mixed with either 15 inactivated human AB serum or with PHILIP to a titer of 8 in the end volume.200 pl thereof is introduced into the top row of wells in a microtiter plate. In the 4 following rows, 100 ml of the mixture is appliea to each well. 200 pl of the I1 l is added to the wells of the top row and mixed with the RPMI 1640 supplemented by serum PHILIP. 100 pl is transferred to the next row, mixed, and so on. Thus, a serial dilution of Il 1 in dilution steps of 1 2 is achieved. 20 to 50 pl of isolated blood lymphocytes as described in Example 1 of the Patent ApplicationNo. 81304560.6 are added. As a consequence of the interaction of I1 l and PHILIP, the cells start synthesizing I1 2. The effectiveness of the synthesis is dependent on the concentration of Il 1. Il 1 activity is quantificated by the titer it exhibits in the culture i.e. by the inverse of the dilution in which the cell number has doubled within seven days in culture see Figure 4.Examples 7Production of Interleukin 2 by use of PHILIP. a Production of Interleukin 2 by use of PHILIP and PITA Peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated as described above, after washing 3 times with RPMI 1640, are suspended in a mixture of RPMI 1640 and PHILIP isolated as described above in Example 1. PHILIP is present at a concentration of 1 1 to 1 32, usually 1 16. The concentration of PHILIP is determined by its biologic activity, which is assayed according to Example 3.A titer of 8 in the end volume is desired. The cells are suspended at a concentration of 3 millions ml and stimulated 4 to 24 hours with PHA in a concentration of 4 lg ml. The stimulation time is preferably 8 20 hours, most preferably 8 12 hours.After stimulation, the cells are washed 3 times as described above, and used to condition the culture medium at a concentration of 3 millions ml in absence of supplements other than those contained in RPMI 1640. The conditioning time should be 18 24 hours, most preferably 20 hours. Thereafter, the cells are spun down and the culture medium collected. The stimulation step might be repeated up to 3 times, if so desired. The condi tioned medium can,if desired, be concentrated on a YN 10 membrane as described above. I1 2 activity can be assayed by either one of the two biological tests described above in this Application. The activity of I1 2 will rise as a direct function of the degree of concentration. The medium containing PHA and PHILIP can be re used up to 3 times for generation of I1 2.b Production of Interleukin 2 by use of PHILIP and Interleukin 1 Mitogen free and serum free Il 1 preparations as described above in this Application are mixed with PHILIP isolated according to the method described above in this Application in such a proportion that PHILIP will be present in a final titer of 8. The culture medium so prepared is used under the same conditions as is PHA and PHILIP containing culture medium used in this Example. The processing of the I1 2 preparation is the same as described above in this Example.Example 8 Inhibition of blast transormation and of continuous Il 2 dependent T cell growth by serine esterase inhibitors. Cells used for blast formation assay are cells which according to the method described above have been incubated for 24 hours in serum free RPMI. Cells used for testing the I1 2 dependent T cell growth are derived from a continuously growing T cell line kept in culture in our laboratories for 24 hours. Cells used for testing the I1 2 dependent T cell growth are dervied from a continuously growing T cell line kept in culture in our laboratory.The preparations to be inactivated by serine esterase inhibitors are incubated either with DFP diisopropylfluorophosphate in a concentration of 0.0024 ml per ml preparation usually 5 ml preparation to be tested is mixed with 60 1 of DFP , or with PMSF phenylmethylsul fonylfluoride in a concentration of 50 mMo1 1 of preparation to be tested. The inactivation is performed at 0 C. After 60 minutes, the preparation is transferred into dialysis bags and dialysed against 1000 ml of RPMI for 6 hours. Then, the RPMI is changed against the same volume of fresh RPMI and dialysis is continued for 24 hours at 40C. The biological test is performed in the following way The inactivated preparations are transferred to microtiter plates after they have been sterilized by filtration as described in Example 4. Cells are added to the wells at a concentration of 50,000 well, and the cell number is counted on day 7 as described in Example 4.Cell counts less than 100,000 are considered indicative of loss of Il 2 activity. In our experiments, we have always either yielded cell counts either of more than 100,000 or less than 50,000 which was the cell number introduced to the well. Usually, a positive test yields cell counts of 400,000 to 600,000.
