## Description
This invention relates to a snowmaking method and machine for producing artificial snow. There is a large number of patented and or currently available machines for creating artificial snow. Typical of such machines are those described in Canadian Patents Nos. 791,579, issued to Atlas Copco Aktiebolag on August 6, 1968 873,089, issued to F.J. Achmuhle et al on June 15, 1971 925,713, issued to Hedco, Inc. on May 8, 1973 and 1,028,514, issued to P.L. Tropeano et al on March 28, 1978, and United States Patents Nos. 3,494,559, issued to C.M. Skinner on February 10, 1970 3,774,843, issued to B.A. Rice on November 27, 1973 3,831,844, issued to J.C. Tropeano et al on August 17, 1974 and 3,945,567, issued to G. Rambach on March 23, 1976. In general, the available machines are designed to create a mist defined by a large number of fine droplets of water, and to freeze the droplets before they reach the ground. Perhaps the three most important considerations when making artificial snow are i proper mixing of the droplets and air, ii maintaining the droplets airborne for a period of time sufficient to ensure freezing and iii keeping energy consumption at a minimum. Another known machine is disclosed in DE A 2042796. DE A 2042796 discloses a snow making device which comprises a tubular casing with an inlet end and an outlet end. A fan is located at the inlet end and adjacent the fan is disposed a nucleator. The fan draws air into the inlet end and the nucleator forms ice nuclei so that a stream of ice nuclei is formed. A nozzle is disposed downstream from the nucleator and generates water droplets which are mixed with the stream of ice nuclei. It has been found that not only are existing machines not energy efficient, but they are somewhat lacking in their ability and efficiency to convert all of the water blown through the machines into snow. Because the machines employ a single, central stream of air and spray water into the airstream from the outside, many water droplets fall from the airstream creating a so called dribbling effect , i.e. large droplets of water fall to the ground before freezing. An object of the present invention is to overcome the problems encountered with existing machines by providing a relatively simple, energy efficient snowmaking machine and method, which ensure proper mixing of air and water, and good heat exchange between atmospheric air and the air water mixture. According to the present invention there is provided a machine for making artificial snow comprising elongate generally cylindrical, tubular outer casing means, fan means in said casing means for drawing air into an inlet end and discharging air through a discharge end of the casing means, nozzle means located centrally in the casing means for spraying water into the stream of air formed by said fan means and nucleator means for mixing a jet of air and water to form very fine droplets of water defining nuclei to promote snow formation characterised in that a tubular inner casing means is located generally coaxially in said outer casing means, said discharge end of the casing being so arranged and configured that said fan creates an annular stream of air, said nozzle means is a turbine nozzle means carried on said inner casing means and located on the longitudinal axis of the outer casing means proximate the discharge end of the outer casing means and arranged to spray water into the centre of said stream of air and in the direction of travel of the air at the discharge end of the outer casing to create a diverging stream of air carried water droplets downstream of the discharge end of the outer casing means, and said nucleator means is disposed between the inner and outer casing means or an imaginary extension line thereof proximate the discharge end of the outer casing means, the nucleator means being arranged to spray said nuclei into the stream of air carried water droplets at a location at or immediately downstream of said discharge end of said outer casing means whereby, temperature permitting, the water droplets adhere to the nuclei to form snow while airborne. The casing used in one embodiment of the machine of the present invention is equipped with an elongated frusto conical discharge nozzle, which reduces the backdraft problem sometimes encountered with existing machines. Under windy conditions, the water mist forming at the periphery of a machine outlet may be blown back and aspirated into the unit to freeze up the unit. By using a long, tapered nozzle there is less chance of backdraft occurring. Another advantage of a long tapered discharge air nozzle and a central water nozzle is that the water remains in the air for a long period of time, with good mixing between atmospheric air and the air water mixture. The use of a central, adjustable water supply nozzle obviates the need encountered with existing machines to periodically adjust a plurality of peripheral nozzles for gallonage selection. Moreover, unlike peripheral nozzles, a central nozzle can be opened fully to flush any ice formed at the discharge end thereof. It is common to provide a blow torch with existing snowmaking machines for thawing frozen nozzles. A single central water nozzle is less expensive than a plurality of peripheral nozzles and requires less plumbing to carry water to the nozzles. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention, and wherein With reference to the drawings, a snowmaking machine in accordance with the present invention generally indicated at 1 is normally mounted on a trailer 2, which carries the machine to a location for use.The trailer 2 is defined by a generally triangular frame 3, a front wheel 4, and a pair of rear wheels 5 one shown supporting the frame, and a tow bar 6 for connecting the frame 3 to a towing vehicle.The snowmaking machine 1 is pivotally mounted in a Y shaped frame 7 on one end of a boom 8 for rotation around a horizontal axis.The frame 7 is rotatably mounted on the boom 8 for rotation around a vertical axis. Thus, the angle of inclination and the direction of discharge of the machine can readily be changed. The boom 8 includes a pair of arms 9 and 10, both of which are pivotally connected to the sides of a rectangular clevis or bracket 11 at horizontally and vertically spaced apart locations.The bracket 11 is mounted on the front end of the frame 3. A second, inverted U shaped bracket 12 is pivotally connected to the top ends of the arms 9 and 10, and the frame 7 is mounted on the bracket 12. Thus, the arms 9 and 10, and the brackets 11 and 12 define a parallelogram linkage for raising and lowering the machine 1.The front end 13 of the arm 9 extends beyond the pivot axis 14 in the bracket 11 and is pivotally connected to the outer end of the piston rod of a hydraulic cylinder 15. The cylinder 15 is pivotally mounted in the frame 11. Extension of the piston rod causes rotation of the boom 8 from the horizontal or transport position phantom outline in Fig. 1 to the elevated or use position shown in solid outline in Fig. 1. Hydraulic fluid can be pumped to the cylinder 15 manually using a commercially available pump not shown . Alternatively, the machine 1, frame 7 and boom 8 can be mounted on a triangular skid 16 Fig. 2 . In such case, a pair of legs 17 are connected to the rear crossbar 18 of the skid, and a single leg not shown replaces the front wheel 4. The skid 16 can be carried between locations using a conventional flatbed trailer not shown . With particular reference to Fig. 4, the snowmaking machine 1 includes an elongated, tubular outer casing 19, which is cylindrical throughout most of its length. The rear, inlet end 20 of the casing 19 is slightly flared to promote the flow of air into the casing. A screen 21 Fig. 2 protects the open rear or inlet end 20 of the casing. The discharge end of the casing 19 is defined by an elongated frusto conical nozzle 22. A frusto conical cowl 23 is provided on the discharge end of the casing 19. The cowl 23 has a closed rear end 24 and an open front or discharge end 25 through which secondary air is discharged. A plurality of openings 26 are provided around the periphery of the casing 19 and the rear end of the nozzle 22 for discharging air into the cowl 23. A tubeaxial fan 27 is mounted coaxially in the casing 19, i.e. with the longitudinal axis of the fan on the longitudinal axis of the casing 19 for drawing air into the rear inlet end 20 of the casing and discharging the air through the nozzle 22. The use of a tubeaxial fan instead of a vaneaxial fan increases the volume of air by approximately 20 for the same horsepower at the same static pressure. A tubeaxial fan also causes twisting or spiral movement of the airstream which results in better mixing and heat exchange between the airstream and ambient or atmospheric air. The fan 27 includes the usual blades 28, which are rotated by an electrical motor 29. The motor 29 is mounted in a cylindrical inner casing 30, which is coaxial with the outer casing 19. The casing 30 is defined by a rear or inlet section 31 containing the motor 29, a smaller diameter intermediate section 32 and a frusto conical outlet section 33, with a closed end 34. A water pipe 35 connected at one end to a source of water not shown under pressure enters the intermediate section 32 of the casing 30 and bends forwardly to a discharge nozzle 36. The nozzle 36 is a semi or fully automatic nozzle of the type which contains spinning turbine teeth, a calibrated volume control, an adjustable combination fog straight stream pattern and a remote control adapting kit for automatic volume and pattern control. The spinning turbine teeth break up the water to the droplet size ideal for snowmaking and form a power fog cone for better control of the pressurized water. Such a nozzle is designed to make the desired snow by spraying the proper volume of water in the right form to the right location. Moreover, the spinning turbine creates a fog which promotes heat exchange between the air and water, thus giving the snow the desired qualities. A suitable nozzle is sold by the Akron Brass Company, a division of Premier Industrial under the trademark Turbojet. The nozzle is normally used on fire fighting equipment. The nozzle 36 is mounted in the end wall 34 of the casing 30 near the open discharge end of the nozzle 22. The arrangement is such that the central cone of water discharged by the nozzle 36 almost immediately intersects the annular air stream created by the fan 27 to create a swirling mixture of water droplets and air. At the same time nucleators 37 one shown mounted in the nozzle 22 inject streams of water nuclei or very small water droplets in air into the combined water and air mixture. The nuclei, being extremely small, freeze first creating nuclei for the formation of snow. The nucleators 37 are connected to sources not shown of water and air under pressure. The air under pressure is normally jed from a compressor carried by the trailer 2. Referring to Fig. 5, in an alternative structure, the rear section 31 of the inner casing 30 is separated from the intermediate section 32 by a partition 38 so that the intermediate section 32 of the casing defines a water inlet manifold. The inlet pipe 35 merely introduces water under pressure into the inlet manifold. Some of the water passes through outlet tubes 39 near the discharge end of the outlet section 33 of the casing 30 to the rear, inlet ends of the nucleators 37. Air under pressure is introduced into the nucleators 37 via inlet pipes 40. In the second embodiment of the invention, the nozzle 36 and the nucleators 37 extend outwardly beyond the discharge end of the nozzle 22, so that all mixing of air and water occurs outside of the casing 19. In operation, the tubeaxial fan 27 creates a turbulent stream of air which is discharged through the nozzle 22 under pressure. At the same time, a central stream of water droplets is injected into the airstream at or immediately downstream of the discharge end of the casing 19. It will be appreciated most of the mixing occurs downstream of the casing 19.The optional cowl 23 creates an annular stream of air which has the dual effect of promoting mixing and maintaining the discharge from the casing 19 in a small area until the air water mixture is well clear of the machine.The shape and path of the air and water stream are also affected by the height and inclination of the casing 19 on the boom 8, and the pressure and shape of the water jet discharged from the nozzle 36.
