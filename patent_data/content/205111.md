# Drive transmission unit.

## Abstract
The drive transmission unit comprises an input shaft 1 having keyed thereto a first bevel gear 10 , in constant mesh engagement with a second bevel gear 11 keyed to a counter shaft 7 and rigidly associated with a first clutch, for causing a first pinion 14 to become rotatively engaged with or disen gaged fron the input shaft 1 . The second bevel gear 11 is rigidly associated with a second clutch for causing a second pinion 18 to become rotatively engaged with or disengaged from the countershaft 79. The first 14 and the second 18 pinions are in constant mesh engagement with an output bevel gear 15 keyed to an output shaft 2 , so that be selec tively engaging one of the clutches and disengaging an other of the clutches, the input and output shafts can be selectively caused to rotate counter directionally or co directionally. The axes of the shafts 1, 2, 7 converge towards a common point to simplify the gear arrangements.
