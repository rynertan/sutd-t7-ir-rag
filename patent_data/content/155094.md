## Description
2 ARYLIMIDAZOt4,5 c PYRIDINES This invention provides long acting orally effective positive inotropic agents. The cardiac glycosides and the sympathomimetic amines are the principal inotropic agents used in the management of congestive heart failure. Although the cardiac glycosides, especially digitalis, are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, they have numerous liabilities such as a low therapeutic index and erratic absorption, and are associated with life threatening arrhythmias and deleterious drug drug interactions. In addition, many patients either do not respond, or become refractory to these agents. The sympathomimetic amines, such as dopamine and epinephrine, have limited utility due to positive chronotropic effects, arrhythmogenic properties, and oral ineffectiveness. More recently, new classes of inotropic agents have been found. Among these, certain 2 phenylimidazo t4,5 b pyridines U.S. Patents No. 3,985,891 and 4,327,100 have been shown to possess inotropic and anticoagulant activity. U.S. Patents No. 4,299,834 and 4,353,909 describe similarly substituted purine and 6 hydroxy imidazot4,5 b pyridine derivatives, respectively. The analogous imidazo 4,5 c pyridines have also been taught to possess inotropic activity see EuropeanPatent Applications 72,926 and 79,083 and British PatentApplication No. 2,119,377. The present invention provides for a series of imidazo derivatives, their pharmaceutical formulations, and their use as long acting orally effective positive inotropic agents which have minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The compounds also possess vasodilatory, bronchodilatory, and anticoagulant activities. This invention provides for pharmaceutically useful aryl substituted imidazo compounds having the formulaeEMI2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, Cl C4 alkoxy, allyloxy, propargyloxy, benzyloxy, C1 C4 alkyl thio, C1 C4 alkyl sulfinyl, C1 C4 alkyl sulfonyl, hydroxy, halo, cyano, nitro, amino, mono or di C1 C4 alkyl amino, trifluoromethyl, or Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy, wherein Q is oxygen, sulfur, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, or a bond, and Z is C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl substituted with halo, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, amino, C1 C4 alkyl thio, C1 C4 alkyl sulfinyl, or 01 C4 alkyl sulfonyl Y is O or NH G is C O or s O r where r is 0, 1, or 2 and R2 is C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl, trifluoromethyl, or NR3R4, where each of h and R4 is independently hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl with the limitations that whenR2 is trifluoromethyl or NR3R4, and G is S O , , r may not be 0 or 1, and with the further limitation that whenY is 0 and G is S O , r may not be 0 or 1. The compounds are useful for treating a mammal, including a human, suffering from or susceptible to the conditions of asthma, thrombosis, hypertension, or heart failure. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises as active ingredient a compound ofFormula I or Ia as defined above, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The Formulae I and Ia are recognized as being tautomeric structures of one another. The imidazo compounds having the hydrogen atom on one of the imidazo nitrogen atoms e.q., Formula I have corresponding tautomeric forms wherein the hydrogen atom is on the other imidazo nitrogen atom e.g., Formula Ia . AsN unsubstituted compounds, each tautomeric form exists in equilibrium with the other and cannot be prepared ar isolated without the presence of the other. For this application, both forms will be considered together.Thus, the compounds of Formula I Ia are known as 2 aryl lH or 3E imidazo 4,5 c pyridines. For simplicity, these compounds will be referred to as compounds of Formula I Ia or by name without designating on which nitrogen atom the hydrogen atom is found A preferred group of compounds are the compounds of Formula I Ia wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, halogen, C1 C4 alkyl thio, C1 C4 alkyl sulfinyl, C1 C4 alkyl sulfonyl, or Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Especially preferred compounds as defined above are those where C1 C4 alkyl is methyl, C1 C4 alkyl sulfinyl is methyl sulfinyl, C1 C4 alkyl sulfonyl is methyl sulfonyl, and C1 C4 alkoxy is methoxy. Preferred Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy compounds are those wherein C1 C4 alkoxy is ethoxy or n propoxy, Q is oxygen, sulfur or sulfinyl, and Z is Cl C4 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl substituted with halo,C1 C4 alkoxy, or hydroxy. Compounds wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkoxy, especially methoxy, are particularly preferred. It is preferred that R1 is attached at the 2l position of the phenyl ring.Also preferred are those compounds wherein G is S O r , especially where r is 2. The following definitions refer to the various terms used throughout this disclosure. The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. The term C1 C4 alkyl refers to the straight and branched aliphatic radicals of one to four carbon atoms including methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, and tert butyl, and includes within it the term C1 C3 alkyl. The term C1 C4 alkoxy includes the straight and branched aliphatic ether radicals of one to four carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, sec butoxy, and tert butoxy. The compounds of this invention as represented by Formulas I and Ia may be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. A preferred method of preparation consists of the reaction of an amine of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein A is amino, with an aryl derivative of the formulaEMI5.2 wherein E is COOB. The reaction may be performed in the absence of a solvent, but is generally carried out in a suitable non reactive solvent, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylene glycol, pyridine, acetone, phosphorous oxychloride, polyphosphoric acid, and the like, optionally in the presence of a base, a catalytic amount of an acid, or a dehydrating agent. Preferred bases are pyridine or triethylamine, p toluenesulfonic is the preferred acid, and dehydrating agents, such as phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous pentoxide, or thionyl chloride may be used. Temperatures in the range of 200C. to 2500C. may be employed with a preferred range of 50 2000C. Other similar methods of preparing the compounds are likewise known. Carboxylic acid derivatives of III may be employed in the above sequence with appropriate modifications in the reaction conditions. For example, an amide derivative of III may be substituted for the acid when condensing with the diamine II, preferably in the presence of a dehydrating agent or base at elevated temperatures, especially in the temperature range of 100 150 C. If E of Formula III is cyano, the reaction with the diamine II is typically performed in the presence of a catalytic quantity of an acid, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, usually at temperatures of 120 1800C. If E is a thioamide derivative, the condensation with the diamine II is best effected in a solvent, such as ethylene glycol, at temperatures of 100 1500C. If, in Formula II, A is a halogen, the reaction is performed with the respective amidine derivative of III.The intermediate thus formed may be first isolated or generated in situ, followed by cyclization at elevated temperatures, preferably in the range of 100 2000C. In the preferred scheme above, when the acidIII E is COOH is unsubstituted or is substituted with unreactive functionalities e.q., alkyl, halogen, etc. , heating with the diamine II A is amino in polyphosphoric acid PPA is the most convenient and preferred method of preparing the respective imidazopyridine or purine. This method was described by Middleton andWibberley, J. Het. Chem., 17, 1757 1980 , for the preparation of imidazo 4,5 b and 4,5 cjpyridines. When the carboxylic acids of Formula III are substituted with groups such as alkoxy, PPA treatment can lead to dealkylation and the preferred conditions for the reaction are by refluxing the reactants in phosphorous oxychloride or xylene with the azeotropic removal of water. Especially when the carboxylic acids III contain phenolic or amino substituents, an alternate method of preparation may be employed. A substituted aldehyde III, E is CHO may be treated with sulfur and morpholine to produce the respective substitutedthioaryl carboxylic acid morpholide which on further treatment with methyl iodide gives the S methyl substituted thioaryl carboxylic acid morpholide iodide derivative. Treatment of this intermediate with the appropriate diamine II, A is amino in a solvent such as ethylene glycol with heating at 40 1500C. produces the desired product I Ia . In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the compounds of Formula I Ia can be prepared by reacting a compound of the Formula IVEMI8.1 or its tautomer, with a halo compound of the formula V R2 G X V where X is halo. The reaction is generally carried out by mixing approximately equimolar amounts of IV and V in a non reactive solvent in the presence of an acid scavenger, although other ratios of IV and V are operative. Examples of non reactive solvents include dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, methylene chloride, toluene, and the like. Organic bases such as triethylamine or pyridine, or salts such as potassium carbonate may be employed as the acid scavenger. The reaction is carried out at temperatures from about OOC. up to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, although temperatures of about 20 50 C. are preferred.This transformation can also be performed employing the analogous carboxylic or sulfonic anhydrides is place of the halides of Formula V. The amino compounds R2 NR3R4 may additionally be prepared by other methods known in the art. The most useful reaction is that of intermediate IV with phosgene in a non reactive solvent to provide the corresponding chloroformic ester or isocyanate which upon treatment with the appropriate amine HNR3R4 provides the desired urea or carbamate I. The corresponding halo sulfonamides and sulfonic esters can also be prepared from IV according to standard procedures and then reacted with the appropriate amine to provide the corresponding sulfonamate ester or sulfamide derivative. In addition, the above functionalizations of the phenol or aniline IV may be performed on related intermediates, i.e., compounds related to IV wherein the imidazole nitrogen atom is protected with a protecting group. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, such a protecting group would have to be stable and inert to the functionalization to provide an intermediate compound related to I where the nitrogen atom was similarly protected. Deprotecting this intermediate can then be accomplished to provide I. Compound protecting groups such as benzyl, which can be removed by hydrogenation, acetyl, which can be removed by mild hydrolysis, and the like may be employed. The starting material 3,4 diaminopyridine is commercially available. Other required pyridines ofFormula II are either commercially available, or may be prepared in the usual manner from available starting materials by the proper sequence of nitrations, reductions, acylations, hydrolyses, halogenations, and aminations. The required carboxylic acids and deriv atives of Formula III are either commercially available, are known in the literature, or can be prepared by published methods as are the compounds of Formula V.Intermediates IV are taught and or can be prepared by the methods described in European Patent Applications 72,926 and 79,083 and British Patent Application 2,119,377. In addition, some of the compounds of FormulaI Ia may be prepared by subsequent derivatizations of other compounds of Formula I Ia by methods known in the art. Thus, sulfide derivatives of Formula I Ia may be transformed into the respective sulfinyl and sulfonyl compounds, amine derivatives may be prepared from intermediate halo compounds, phenol substituents may be selectively alkylated, and like transformations.The sulfinyl and sulfonyl derivatives of this invention may be prepared directly by the reaction of the corresponding intermediates II with III, or by oxidation of the corresponding sulfide compounds of Formula I Ia by methods known in the art. One or two equivalents, respectively, of hydrogen peroxide in an alcohol, a peracid, such as meta chloroperbenzoic acid in methylene chloride, or similar oxidants may be used to effect these transformations. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of this invention include salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and di carboxylic acids, phenyl substi tuted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. The preferred salts of this invention are those derived from inorganic acids, especially hydrochloric acid. The compounds may be administered by various routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intranasal routes, being usually employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. It is a special feature of these compounds that they are effective positive inotropic agents, vasodilators, or bronchodilators following oral administration. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound. Accordingly, the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient a compound of Formula I Ia or an acid addition salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi solid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the composition can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols as a solid or in a liquid medium , ointments containing for example up to 10 by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders. Some examples of suitable carriers are lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propyl hydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate or mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may, as is well known in the art, be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient. The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to 500 mg., more usually 25 to 300 mg., of the active ingredient. The term unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The active compounds are effective over a wide dosage range and for example dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.5 to 300 mg. kg. of body weight. In the treatment of adult humans, the range of from about 1 to 50 mg. kg., in single or divided doses is preferred. However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered, the chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient s symptoms, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The following preparations and examples further illustrate the preparation of the compounds and formulations of this invention. The examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The term m e used in characterizing the products refers to the mass tocharge ratio of ions which appear in the mass spectra of the products. In general, the values of the major peaks correspond to molecular weights, and are so designated M . Example 1 2 2 Methoxy 4 methylsulfonamidophenyl imi dazo 4,5 c pyridine A.

Increases in contractility were tabulated as millimeters of pen deflection in excess of the baseline values. In each experiment the maximum contractility was measured. As a percent of control control 100 percent , the compound of Example 1 produced a contractility of 149 at 10 M and 168 at 10 N M and the compound of Example 2 gave a contractility of 240 at 10 5M and 326 at 10 4M. Experiments in Anesthetized Dogs Mongrel dogs of either sex ranging in weight from 7 to 14 kg. were used. Anesthesia was induced with sodium pentobarbital 30 mg. kg., i.v. and maintained with supplemental doses as required. A positive pressure pump was used to ventilate the dogs through an endotracheal tube 18 strokes minute, 20 ml. kg. stroke 1 , and a heating pad kept the body temperature at 37 380C. Femoral arterial blood pressure was measured through a polyethylene catheter filled with heparin solution 16 units ml. and connected to a Statham pressure transducer. A strain gauge arch sutured to the right ventricle of the heart measured cardiac contractility. Tension on the gauge was adjusted to 50 g. and the gain of the recorder Beckman dynograph was set so that 50 g. caused a 10 mm. pen deflection cardiac contractile tension was measured as millimeters of pen deflection or grams of tension. The drug was administered following a 30 45 minute equilibrium period as an i.v. bolus 2 5 ml. in a normal saline vehicle. In a control experiment, rapid intravenous injection of 50 ml. of 5 percent dextran and mechanical compression of the aorta showed that the contractility measurements were independent of changes in preload and afterload. Heart rate was derived by means of a cardiotach which was triggered by the arterial pressure pulse signal and displayed on the polygraph. The maximum effects on contractility at various dose levels were calculated as a percent of control control 100 percent . The compound of Example 1 produced an ED50 dose, i.v., which produced a peak increase of 50 over control of 0.030 mg. kg. while the compound of Example 2 gave anED50 of 6 mcg. kg.
