# A system to realize spherical or hemispherical or partially spherical constructions.

## Abstract
A system for the realization of spherical surfaces, in which a discrete number K of spherical triangular faces of equal area, are brought close and joined to each other along the sides, so that the sperical surface takes on the appearance of a sphere polyhedron, each individual tri angular spherical face having only one side in common with the adjacent face, and, in respect to the said side, the two adjacent faces are mirror images of each other. If a sphere is completely covered with identical spherical triangular forces, each common point formed by the apexes of a series of the spherical triangular faces lies on a straight line formed by opposite sides of two spheri cal triangular faces. Consequently the sphere polyhedron can be obtained from a particular number N of great circles.

## Description
A A system to realize spheric or hemispheric or partially spheric constructions. Background of the invention The finding permits to achieve spheric or hemispheric cupolas surfaces or simply portions of spheric surfaces, through the device of bringing close to eoch other triangular spheric faces, all equal and two by two chain specular to each other, obtained, in the various cases, through the segmentation of the spheric surface itself by means of suitable interlacings of great circles, and it permits also to achieve the load bearing structures of said spheric, or hemispheric cupolas surfaces,or simply of portions of spheric surfaces, by the materialization of the great circles which form the various weavings or in terlacings by means of continuous band shaped constructive members strips , which will be suitably fixed to each other. The finding offers, furthermore, the opportunity of realized psrticularly sturdy load bearing struc tures for the abovesaid spheric or hemispheric cupolas sufaces or portions of spheric surfaces, by means of the so called technics of the more concentric shells type, so that the various great circles interlacings are achieved , which interlacings are each internal to the other, being the interlacings of the same species, similar and equi placed, and having slightly different radii , so that the interlacings themselves can be mutually anchored each other, along the sides of aII the faces, by means of strenghteninb latticeworks, Summary of the inventionI General introduction N continuous bandlike elements or strips are taken, all having the same length,and each of them is closed upon itself, in such a. way to form a circle. It is essential that each of these bands, circle shaped, be, accordion to the cases, suitably perforated or anyhow marked at well determined places, in a way which will be shortly explained, in order to obtain that this group of N great circles this number li to be shortly indicated case by case will be able to be mounted, according to a well precise scheme, such that the N great circles , joined together at the already pre arranged perforation or mar kind places, will form, each time, a particular in terlacing pattern which will constitute the loadbearing framework of a complete spheric surface, which will present the particular feature of dividing the whole sphere into a well determined number K of triangular spheric faces, all equal and specular to each other, K being a number which will be indicated in the following for the various cases. From a strictly constructional standpoint, each great circle represents a continuous beam closed upon itself, so that each interlacing pattern of the reat circles will determine, in the whole, a higly hyperstatic i.e.statically indeterminable structure. It is, then, to be observed that, if one would desire to utilize only partially the various interlacing patterns of great circles, employing for instance, instead of some complete great circles, simply some hemi great circles or even some portions of great circle obtained, however, always, by strips, suitably perforated or marked in that determined way , it will possible to realize, by the same abovementioned criterion triangular spheric faces, all equal and two by two specular , also the load bearing structures of hetaispheric surfaces cupola a or domes or of portions of a spheric surface. In the following description, only the losd bear ing frameworks of complete spheric surfaces,will.be presented, that is the interlacing patterns of complete great circles, since the cases of hemispheric surfaces cupolas or of portions of spheric surfaces are obviously included in the more general case of the complete sphere. Ir Descriptive schematic treatment of the four basic kinds or species of great circle interlacing patterns Before dealin6 with the systematic treatment of the four species of basic interlacing patterns of great circles, it will be suitable to formulate a preliminar remark about the number values characterizing the sides of the spheric triangular faces which appear in each interlacing pattern. Said sides, it will be recalled, are arcs of a great circle, and have been expressed, as it is usual, in degrees and decimal submultiples of a degree, measured from the centre 0 of the sphere. The theoretical values have been calculated up to the eighth decimal digit, but, obviously , in the practical realizations one will stop earlier, according to what is reasonably requested by the order of magnitude of the concerned measure values. Furtnermore, always in order to emphasize the characteristics which are common to all the four basic interlacing patterns of great circles, we repeat that each interlacing pattern determines, on the sphere, spheric triangular faces all equal and such that two generic adjacent faces will have one, and only one, common side and will be specular in respect to said common side.For each interlacing,one can think the whole sphere as obtainable by the chainapplication of the speculfrity criterion which is valid for its faces, such that the sphere itself wi11 be, in effects, conceived as. a sphere polyhedron, that is as a polyhedron having triangular spheric faces all equal, and, if adjacent, specular to each other , which will exclusively result from the intersection of complete great circles. This stated, we can pass to the systematic treatment of the four kinds of basic interlacing patterns of great circles. Brief description of the drawings Fig. 1, which is simply of an indicative type, shows, in an oxonometric isoetric view, a materialized great circle Fig 2 is a perforation plan which gives the distance between successive perforations or markings of a brent circle of the type mentioned in Fig. 1, in the case of great circles which are intended for a first species of interlacing patterns Fig. 3 shows the development, on a plane, of the 24 faces deriving from the first species of interlacing pattern Fig. 4 shows in an isometric view, a basic triangle of an interlacing pattern of the first species, with its length measuring values for each side which are expressed in degrees in respect to the sphere centre Figs. 5 and 6 are two perforation plans which give the distance between successive markings of a first set of three great circles,and, respectively, of a second set of six great circles for a basic interlacing pattern of the second species Figv 7 shows the development on a plane of a second species interlacing pattern Fig. 8 is a view similar to that of Fig, 4, but relating to a second species interlacing pattern Figs. 9, 10 and 11 are views similar to those ofFigs. 2, 3 and 4, but relating to a third species interlacing pattern with fifteen great circles Figs. 12, 13, 14 and 15 are views similar to those of Figs. 5, 6, 7 end 8, but relating to a fourth species interlacing pattern , with n l great circles, Fig. 12 referring to only one of said great circules while Fig. 13 refers to the n residual ones Figs. 16 and 17 show generically the interlacing patterns of a cupola having the interlacing patterns according to the invention and according to the until known systems Pigs. 18, 19 and 20 schematically illustrate the elemental structures which are obtainable according to the invention, respectively with simple, double, and triple frames shells Fig. 21 shows a first derived interlacing pattern, of which Fig. 22 represents in plan two basic second spe cies or third species triangles, representing the iterative portion of the derived interlacing pattern Figs. 23 and 24 show other schemes of derived interlacing patterns Fig. 25 shows, developed on a plane, the itera tive portion of another derived interlacing pattern, illustrated in the Fig. 26, completely Fig. 27 shows, in sn isometric view, a different materialization form of a generic spheric trisngle, determined by an interlacing pattern of great circles. A Basic f irst sDecies interlacing pattern let us take N 6 constructional band like elements strips and let us perforate or anyhow mark them as indicated in Fig. 2. Then, as usual, we will close them in a circle shape as indicatively represented in Figv 1 , 80 arranging the things that the end perforations L of each band will coincide..Obviously, each band forming a great circle, insteed of being superposed along a portion, as indicatively represented in Fig. 1, may be anyhow joined and welded, even butt welded. The quantities, and appearing in Fig. 2 and characterizing the perforation or marking way of the band like elements or strips. are the following 540, 73561032 1 7Q , 52877936, while it is clear that the complete sequence along the whole great circle is the following . î î . With the N 6 thus perforated or marked grest cir cles, let us then realize the first species basic interlacing n ttern, conventionally represented inFig. 3, from which it results that, that interlacing pattern locates altogether, on the whole sphere, K 24 faces, all equal, constituted by isosceles spheric rigiit angled triangles, which, by analogy with the inter .lacing pattern to which they belong, will be called first species basic triangles. Each of them, represented in Fig. 4, to which now we expressly refer, is characterized by the following data Angles 90 60 60 Spherical excess 90 600 600 1800 300 Sides 1 70 ,52877936 54 ,73561032 54 ,73561032 Perimeter 180 ,00000000 Obvious is the remark that the quantities î and m which appear in Fig. 2, with reference to the band perforations, are simply the sides of the first spe cies basic or fundamental triangle. Returning now to Fig. 3, which represents in a conventional manner the basic first species interlacing pattern, constituted by the N 6 great circles, we believe that in order to achieve its exact inter pretation, it will be suitable to provide some further explanation indeed, the impossibility is kno wn of representing on,a plane, without deformations, a spherical surface, and, therefore, these graphical difficulties appear also in Fig. 3.In that Figure we have made recourse to the device of opening the spherical surface according to the four faces of a spherical tetrahedron, each of these faces comprising, in turn, six first species basic triangles, as those of Fig. 4, Each face of spherical tetrahedron has been, then, in turn, stretchedt on a plane, with a certain consequent deformation. It follows from this that the K 24 fundamental first species spherical triangles, which form the spherical surface, and are all equal each other and all of them right angled and isosceles, not always, however, will appear as such in the drawing, given the abovementioned graphical difficulties. For clearness sake, then, we have indicated by the same numbered letter, provided once with an apex and the second time without the apex, dismetral ly opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron. Furthermore, for a reason which will sppear evi dent in the following, when the derived interlacing patterns are considered, it is of, interest to point out that the first species interlacing pattern ofFig. 3 is characterized by the following elements three axes of quaternary symmetry pairs of disme trically opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, on which 900 angles converge , and precisely L1 L1 L2 L2 3 x 4 12 constant L3 L3 four axes of ternary symmetry pairs of diametri cally opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, on which 600 angles converge , and precisely M1 M1 M2 M2 4 x 3 12 constant. M3 M3 M4 M4 Incidentally, we observe that the product of the symmetry degree of an axis the number boxed within a small rectangle by the number of symmetry axes of that degree is a constant. B Basic second species interlacing patternLet us take N 9 constructional band like elements strips and divide them into two groups. A first group comprising three bands, which we will call, first type11 bands will be perforated or anyhow marked as indicated in Fig. 5, whereas a second group, consituted by the six residual bands which we will call second type bands will be perforated or. anyhow marked as indicated in Fig. 6. Then, as usual, we will close according to a circle shape all the nine bands as indicatively r epresented in Fig. 1 , arranging the things so that the two end holes of each band Ca for the three first type bands, and C for the six second type bands will coincide. The quantities 1, m and c, which appear in theFigs. 5 and 6 and characterize the perforstion or markin kind of the nine band like elements or strips, are the following 540,73561032 m 450,00000000 35 ,26438968 , while, as it appears clearly from the Figs 5 and 6 themselves, the complete sequences along the whole great circle are respectively, for the bands of the two types as well as I c c 1 1 c c l Jith the N 9 thus perforated or marked great circles, let us,then, realize the basic or fun damental second species interlacing pattern, conventionally represented in Fig. 7, from which it appears that this interlacing pattern locates, in all, on the whole sphere, K 48 faces, all equal, constituted by spherical right angled triangles which, by analogy with the interlacing pattern to which they be long, will be called second species fundamental triangles . Each of them, represented in Fig. 8, to which now we refer explicitly, is characterized by the following dats Angles 90 600 45 Spherical excess 90 600 450 1800 150 Sides 1 540,73561032 45 ,00000000 35 ,26438968 Perimeter 135 ,00000000. The observation appears obvious that the quantities î, and which appear in the Figs. 5 and 6, with reference to the band perforations are simply the sid es of the second species fundamental triangle. Reverting now to Fig. 7, which represents in a conventional manner the second species basic interlacing pattern, constituted by the N 9 great circles, we believe that, here too, in order to get its exact interpretation, it is advisable to spend some explaining words. Indeed, we are here in face, of a graphical representation which is similar but not identical to that of Fig. 3. The only difference is that here we have had recourse to the device of opening the spherical surface sccording to the eight faces, of a spherical octahedron, each of these fen comprising, in turn, six fundamental second species trisn gles, as that illustrated in Fig. 8. Each octahedron. face has been, then ,stretched on a plane, with a certain consequent deformation. In order to correctly interpret the Fig. 7, it is suitable to take into account that the K 48 fundamental second species spherical triangles are all equal and all right angled triangles es, having in mind that always exist in the drawing, the known graphical difficulties connected to the rep resentation of a spherical surface on a plane. the diametrically opposed apices of the sphere po lyhedron have been indicated by the same numbered letter, once provided with an apex and the second time without apex. Finally, here too, for a reason which will appear evident in the following, when the derived interlacing patterns will be considered, it is of interest to point out that the second species interlacing pettern of Fg, 7 is characterized by three axes of quaternary symmetry pairs of diametrically opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron,into which 45 angles concur , and precisely C1 C1 C2 C2 3 x 4 12 constant C3 C3 four axes of ternary symmetry pairs of diametri cally opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, in to which 60 angles concur , and precisely M1 M1 M2 M2 4 x 3 12 constant M3 M3 M4 M4 six axes of binary simmetry pairs of diametrical ly opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, into which 90 angles concur , and precisely L1 L1 L4 L4 6 X 2 12 constant. L5 L5 L L Here, too, it is observed that the product of the symmetry degree of an axis the number enclosed wi thin the rectangular box by the, number of symmetry axes of that degree is a constant.c Basic third species interlacing pattern Let us take N 15 band like constructional elements strips and let us perforate or anyhow mark them as indicated in Fig. 9. Then, as usual, we will close them according to a circle shape as indicatively represented in Fig. 1 , taking care that the two end holes La of each band coincide. The quantities î, , and C which appear in that Fig, q and characterize the perforation or marking of the fifteen band like elements or strips are the following î 37 ,37736813 m 310,71747442 c 200,90515745, whereas, as it appears clearly from the same Fig. 9, the complete sequence, along the whole great circle, is the following î î î î . With the thus perforated or marked N 15 great circles, let us, then, realize the fundamental third species interlacing pattern which is conventionally represented in Fig. 10, from which it appears that said interlacing pattern locates, in all, on the whole sphere, K 120 faces, all equal, constituted by spherical right angled trisngles which, by analogy with the interlacing pattern to which they belong, will be called fundamental or basic third species triangles. Each of them, represented in Fig 11, to which we now expressly make reference, is characterized by the following data angles alpha 90 ss 60 t 360 Spherical excess 900 600 360 180 60 Sides î 37 ,37736813 31 .71747442 20 ,90515745 Perimeter P 90 ,00000000. Here, too, the observation is obvious that the quantities 1, m and c which appear in Fig. 9, in relation with the perforation of the bands are nothing but the sides of the basic third species triangle. Reverting then to Fig. 10, which represents in a conventional way the third species fundamental interlacing pattern, constituted by the N 15 great circles, we believe it will useful recall that here we have a pattern very similar to that of Fig. 7 . Here, too, we have made recourse to the device of opening the spherical surface according to the eight faces of a spherical octahedron the only difference is that, now, each octahedron face comprises, in turn, quite fifteen basic third species triangles, as that ofFig. 11. Each octahedron face has been, successively, stretched on a plane, with a certain consequent deformation. In order to get a correct interpretation of Eig.10, the remarks are, therefore, valid as well, as the expedients which have been already suggested with reference to Figs. 3 and 7. In particular, when examining Fig, 10, it is, to be taken in mind that the K 120 fundamental spherical triangles of the third species are all equal and right angled, even if this may not appear completely evident from the. drawing, owing to the known graphical difficulties which are encountered when representing a spherical surface on 8 plane the diametrically opposed apices of the sphere po lyhedron have been indicated by an identical num bered letter, once provided with an apex and in the other case apice less. Here, too, for a reaspn that, as already said, will appear evident from the following, when the matter of the derived interlacing patterns will be discussed, it is of interest to point out, finally, that the third species interlacing pattern of Fig, 10 is characterized by six axes of quinary symmetry pairs of diametrical ly opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, into which 360 angles concur , and precisely ci all C2 C2 C3 C3 6 x 5 30 constant C4 C4 C5 C5 C6 C6 ten axes of ternary symmetry pairs of diametrical ly opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, into which 600 angles concur , and precisely M1 M1 M2 M2 M3 M3 M4 M4 M5 M5 10 x 3 30 constant M6 M6 M7 M7 M8 M8 M9 M9 M10 M10 fifteen axes of binary symmetry pairs of diametri cally opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, into which 90 angles concur , and precisaly L1 L1 L2 L2 L3 L3 L4 L4 L5 L5 L6 L6 L7 L7 1 5 x 2 30 constant , L8 L8 L9 L9 L10 L10 L11 L11 L12 L12 L13 L13 L14 L14 L15 L15 Rere, too, it is observed that the product of the degree of symmetry of on axis the number enclosed within the rectangular box by the number expressing the symmetry axes of that degree is a constant.D Basic fourth s pecies interlacing pattern let us consider N n 1 band like construction al elements or strips n being an integer 2 , and divide them into two groups or sets. A first set,com prising only one band which we will call first type band or equator will be.perforated or anyhow marked in the way indicated in Fig. 12, while the sec ond set, comprising the residual n bands which we will call second type bands will be perforated by us or anyhow marked in the way indicated in Fig. 13. The,n,as usual, we will close according to a circle shape all the n 1 bands as indicatively represented in Fig. 1 , taking care that the two end holes of each band L1 for the first type band, and M for the n second type bands coincide. The quantities and which appear in the Figs. 12 and 13 and characterize the perforation or marking way of the n 1 band like elements or strips are the following 90 that is, ss we will later see meridisn 360 2n that is the l 2n part of the equator , while, as it appears clear from the same Figs 12 and 13, the complete sequences along the whole great circle, result to be, respectively for the first type band equator EMI22.1 for 2n times and for the n second type bands EMI22.2 for 4 times With the N n 1 thus perforated or marked great circles, let us, then, realize the fourth species fun damental interlacing pattern, which is conventionally represented in Fig, 14. The spherical fourth species interlacing pattern, formed by the n 1 great circles, is, sub stantially, the rather intuitive one which is obtained by dividing the terrestrial sphere into 2n equal spherical sectors, by mesns of 2n meridians that ia n great circles , all of them passing through the poles M and M . These meridisns are, in turn, intersected by the great circle conatituting the equator, which divides them into half portibns . in all, there fore, n 1 great circles, which will form, by intersecting each other, K 4nfaces, all equal, which are constituted by spherical doubly right angled triangles. We observe that the fourth species fundamental interlacing psttern represents a rather degenerate case in respect to the three previous cases Indeed, the D case, rather than representing a determined resolution of the spherical surface into a well defined number K of faces, as, instead, it happens in the t , B and C cases, , represents a whole family of resolutions of the spherical surface, as it appears clearly from the indefiniteness of the numberN n 1 of the great circles and of the number 4n of the faces. Anyway, the D interlacing pattern, which, differently from the other three interlacing patterns, is rather intuitive, is definitely to be listed among the four fundamental lnterlacing patterns, both due to a completeness reason from the mathematical standpoint and to a pratical, of s constructional order, reason, since the D interlacing pattern can find, as well as the remaining three, a full application iu the case of cupolas which are realized through the technics o theaconcentric shells with strengthening latticeworks, which we will men tion in the following. The K 4n faces of the interlacing pattern are constituted, as it has been said, by doubly rightangled spherical triangles, all equal, which, by analogy with the interlacing pattern to which they belong, will be called fundamental fourth species triangles . Each of them, represented in the Fig. 15, to which now we expressly refer, is characterized by the following data Angles 90 90 360 2n Spherical excess 90 90 360 2n 180 360 2n Sides î 90 that is, meridian î 90 that is, meridian m 360 2n that is the 1 2n th portion of the equator Perimeter P 1800 360 2n Here, too, the observation is obvious that the quantities and m which appear in the Figs, 13 and 12, with reference to the band perforations, are. not hing but the sides of the fourth species fundamental triangle. Reverting now to Fig. 14, which represents the fourth species basic interlacing pattern, constituted by the N n 1 great circles, we observe that here we are in face of a graphical conventional rep resentation which is similar to that which has been adopted forth other three interlacing patterns see Figs. 3, 7 and, 10 .The only difference consists of the fact that here the sphere has bern opened as a flower into the 2n spherical sectors obtain ed through the intersection of n great circles., intersecting each other along the polar axis M M said spherical sectors, each containing two triangu lar faces, have been successively stretched on a plane, with a certsin, consequent, deformation. Here, too, the diametrically opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron have been marked by numbered letter, once provided with an apex and, the second time, respectively apex less. For a correct interpretation of Fig. 14 finally, the same remarks end expedients are valid which have been suggested for the similar Figs. 3, 7 and 10, even if, in this case, the deformation errors due to stretching of the spherical triangular faces on a plane are less conspicuous. Finally, here too, for a reason which will sppe ar as evident in the following, when the derived interlacing patterns will be treated, it is of interest to point out that the fourth species interlacing pattern illustrated in Fig. 14 is characterized by one symmetry K M axis of a 2n degree pair of diametrically opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, into which 36O0 2n angles concur, so that, in conclusion, we will have l x 2n 2n constant n binary symmetry axis pairs of diametrically opposed apices of the sphere polyhedron, into which 90 angles concur , and precisely L1 L1 , L2 L2 ........ Ln so that it follows, finally n x 2 2n constantHere, too, it may be observed that the product of the symmetry degree of an axis given by the number within the rectangular box by the number of symmetry axes of that degree is a constant. At this point, in order to conclude the systematic treatment of the four specips of basic interlac . ing patterns. of great circles, it will be suitable to formulste a general observation which joins them all together. As it may be deduced by the Figs. 4, 8, 11 and 15, which represent the fundamental spherical triangul sr faces of the four species, the angles which do ap pear in them have only the following values 90 600 450 360 and 3600 2n Now, startln from the already formulated criterion of generation of the sphere polyhedrons, that is applying chain wise the specularity criterion of the adjacent faces, the immediate consequence follows that.the angles, pertaining to the various triangular faces, concurring into forming a given apex of the sphe re polyhedron, shall be all equal each other. And since they are always in an even number 360 divided by 900, or by 600, or by 450, or by 360 , or by 3600 2n, will give always as 8 result an even integer , it follows that at each apex of the sphere po polyhedron, if a certain angle of a certain face will be present angle which may take only the following values 900, 600, 450, 360 or else 360 2n , also its apex opposed angle will be present.That is, an apex of the sphere polyhedron does not constitutes a break point for the sides srcs of a great circle belonging to the various faces concurring to form that apex, And since this fact is valid for all the faces concurring into all the apices of the sphere polyhedron, it follows that the resolution of the spherical surface will result, each time, from the int erl acing of a well determined amount of complete great circles, intersecting each other and a peculiarity of the finding consists quite in this facti III Further considerations of s constructional chars cater At this point, once concluded the s srstematic des criptive section relating to the four species of bas ic or fundamental interlacing patterns of great circles which divide the spherical surface into K spherical triangular faces, all equal each other, we will develop some considerations more closely pertain ing to the constructional aspect of the structures that can thus b realized, in.the case that they are complete spherical structures as well as hemi spheri cal cupolss as well as,anyhow,portions of a spherical surface. It is, indeed, apparent that all that has been sa id for the complete sphere may be quite valid also for the realization of portions of spherical surfaces, and in particular, for the hemi spherical surfaces cupolas . In effects, since two great circles, intersecting each other, divide each other by half slways, in order to realize 8 cupola, starting from the conception of a complete sphere, it wilI suffice to consider a ny base great circle, and to realize the remaining part of the structure by the half great circles all placed on the same side in respect to the base great circle. This stated, we believe to be suitable to insist upon one of the fundamental advantages offered by the finding, in that itis obtainable by means of B suitable interlacing pattern of great circles, that is, in practice, of continuous band like constructional elements, all having the same length, circle shaped and suitably perforated or anyhow marked forth joining with other similar bands.We will observe that the thus obtained interlacing patterns, such as they result from the the Figs. 3, 7, 10 and 14, and such as they are generally represented in theFig. 16 which schematically illustrates the case of a cupola , represent a novel solution which gives rise to constructions of a remarksble sturdiness, if they are compared with other spherical constructions, which only seemingly are similar to the previous ones, as for instance could be obtained by realizing the sides of the spherical triangular faces always by band like portions of a great circle, but all in dependent from each other and broken at the apices, where they would be simply fixed by pins or pivots with the adjacent elements, as it has been indicatively represented in Fig. 17, which schematizes a Cu cupola which has been realized by this over simplified criterion. In order to convince oneself ot this, it will suf fice to think about the completely different consequences which would result, in the two cases, from the complete yielding of a fastening stud or pivot at an apex. In the first case, indicatively represented in Fig. 16, owing to the continuity of the bandlike strips constituting the great circles, strips which not interrupt at the apices, the consequence of the yielding of an apex pivot for instance, in N would be practically unimportant, and would not anyway imply a deformability of any part of the interlacing pattern in the second case, instead sides which are all independent and interrupted at the apices, as represented in Fig. 17 , the consequence would follow now, due for instance, to the yielding of the pivot at N, that all the sides concurring into this apex N, where the pivot yielded, would be now free to rotate about the pivots placed at the o ther end of each side P Q R S T and U . Briefly, we will be able to state thst, in the first case continuous great circles, according to the in invention we have a clearly hyperstatic construction in the second case, on the contrary ïndependent sides, fixed to the apices we have only a strictly indeformable spherical framework. This stated, and more and more probing the constructional aspect and the practical realization of spherical, hemi spherical in the case of cupolas or partially spherical constructions, obtained according to the invention, we want to point out that it will be always possible to increase the sturdiness of the corresponding load bearing structures through the realization of more concentric spherical surfaces, or concentric shells ,all of the same type, that is, considering the complete sphere, as that of Fig. 3, for the first species interlacing. pattern with, K 24 fsces, triangular and equal, or that of Fig.7, for the second species interlacing pattern with E 48 triangular, equal faces, or that of Fig, 10, for the third species interlacing pattern with K 120 triangular, equal faces, or finally that of Fig. 14, for the fourth species interlacing pattern with K 4n triangular, equal faces. Anyway, whichever be the type of interlacing pattern that one wants to achieve, here included also optionally the rived interlacing patterns, the concentric shells shall be, not only all of the same kind, but also all similar and equi placed, in the meaning that the corresponding apices of the respec tive sphere polyhedrons shall, all, be in line each o ther andin line with the common centre of the sphere..Furthermore, if the various, concentric shells, similar and equiplaced, will also have slightly differing each other the respective radii, it will be, always feasible to join with each other, by a conventional strengthening latticework, the corresponding sides of two generic shells , one immediately in ternal in respect to the other, which we wilL call contigueus shells .And this is valid for all, the. contiguous shells of the whole, from the outermost to the innermost.In other words, the strengthening latticework will constitute a kind of seaming between the contiguous shells , seaming which will develop itself within the gap having a constant value exis ting between the shells themselves, and along all the equiplaced sides of ell the faces of the two said contiguous shells 0 In this way a stiff and sturdy load bearing structure will be achieved for the whole spherical surface or for the whole cupola, in the case of a hemi spherical structure . To better explain what we have just exposed about the load bearing structures of the tore concentric shells type, we have g enerically represented the generic triangular face spherical of a generic interlacing pattern of great circles, in various cases, and precisely Fig. 18 single shell structure, that is simpleframe structure,obviously lacking in strengthening latticework Fig. 19 two concentric shells structure, that is a double framework structure, with a strenghtening latticework between the two contiguous adjacent shells Fig. 20 three concentric shells structure, that is a triple framework structure, with two strenghtening latticeworks between the two pairs of con tiguous shells which can be localized in the whole structure. And one could thus continue until structures having n concentric shells are achieved. In the wi s. 19 and 20, in order to avoid useless complications in the drawing, we have represented the stren thening latticework only for a side of the gen eric face. Such latticework, in effects, shall be.considered as extended, obviously, to all the sides of all the faces.IV Interlacing Patterns which are derived from the fundamental interlacin patterns Any, whichever be, of the four interlacing patterns of lst, 2nd,3rd or fourth species , before mentioned, which we will globally indicate by the term of fundamental or basic interlacing patterns, can be, in its turn, utilized as a guide or model in order to realize a new interlacing pattern, which at will can be formed by complete great circles or by parts of great circles, which will rely on the fundamental interlacing pattern, exploiting its symmetries. It is just this novel type of interlacing pattern that we will call derived interlacing pattern. We believe it useful to explain, st this point, that, in practice, a derived interlacing pattern may be realized both together with the basic interlacing pattern which has generated it, and independently from it In this second case, the basic interlacing pattern will disappear, and the derived interlacing pattern, the only one surviving the op eration, may appear also much different from the basic interlacing pattern which generated it. A mo re careful examination will reveal, however, always that the derived interlacing pattern will present the same symmetries enjoyed by the generating fundamental interlacing pattern.Obviously, also for the derived interlacing pattern, all the considerstions shall apply which were formulated for the fundamental interlacing patterns about the feasibility of the realization of concentric shells structures. Anyway, to further safeguard the originality and the extent of the finding, as well to further explain the concept of derived interlacing pattern, we want here in the following to mention at lesst four derived interlacing patterns, obtainable in a particularly easy way from the fundamental interlacing patterns, and chosen emblematically am ong the innumerable possible derived interlacing patterns. These ere the derived interlacing patterns illustrated in Pig. 21 first derived interlacing pattern , in the Figse 23 and 24 2nd end 3rd derived interlacing patterns and in Fig. 26 fourth derived interlacing pattern . The first three derived interlacing patterns Figs. 21, 23 and 24 have all the feature of being constituted by complete great circles, whereas the fourth interlacing pattern, always of the derived type, Fig. 26 ,is constituted by simple arcs of great circles, and not by complete great circles. A The first derived interlacing pattern Fig.21 is constituted by four complete great circles, ,indi cated by chain lines, and it has been derived by the fundamental interlacing pattern of Fig. 7, of second species indicated in the background by a continuous line , by the simple joining two by two of the spices of the two right angles of all the pairs of second species fundamental triangles, having the hypotenuse in common, as generically indicated in Fig.22, wherein, for drawing clarity and expedience, it has been assumed to operate upon a plane surface instead than upon a spherical surface, From said Figure it appears anyway the 9 arc is perpendicular to the hypotenase 2, and since, once the.computations effected, it follows also that LP 300 as viewed from the sphere centre , it follows that, finally, IPI, 2 x LP 2 x 30 600. Now, since the second species triangles ompri sing the whole fundamental interlacing pattern are in all 48 in number, it follows that the whole deve lopment of the first derived interlacing pattern chain lines of Fig. 21 is given by LP x 48 300x x 48 1440 4 x 3600, that is, as beforesaid, by four great circles. In order to facilitate the reading of Fig, 21, we have indicated by the same numbe, from 1 to 4 , enclosed within a small circle, the arcs each of 600 belonging to the same great circle. It appears clear that the here examined inter lacing pattern, constituted by the four great circles, marked by a chain line in Fig. 21, considered by itself alone, locates on the sphere, an equilater . al octshedric hexahedric sphere polyhedron, having in all 14 equilateral faces, six of which are square faces and eight are triangular faces, having,all of them, equal sides having each the value ME 2 60 as viewed from the sphere centre we have, indeed, 8 cube hexahedron and an octshedron, which are. interpenetrated each other and alternated . At this point, it is älso to be observed that all the derived interlacing patterns which will be mentioned in the following sre deduced from the fundamen tal third species interlacing pattern of Fig. 10, which in the drawings will be always drawn as background, by a thin continuous line see Figs. 23 and 26 .Among them, we will have 3 , The second derived interlacing pattern, in dictated in Fig. 23 by a thick chain line it is constitutted, in all, by six great circles, and has been deduced by the same process already adopted to deduce the first derived interlacing pattern with the only difference that now one operates upon the funda mental third species interlacing pattern, whereas, in the previous case, we had operated upon the fundamental second species interlacing pattern that is, here too, we have joined two by two each other the apices of the two right angles of all the pairs of basic third species triangles having in common the hypotenuse, as it is still generally indicated in Sig. 22, wherein LP appears to be always perpendicul sr to the hypotenuse 2 assuming, always, for convenience and drawing clarity, that we operated upon a plane instead of a spherical surface . Once the com putations made, this time we obtsin LPL 2 x LP 2 x 18 36 always viewed from the sphere centre . Now, since,in all, the third species triangles com posing the whole fundamental interlacing pattern a re 120 in number, it follows that the whole development of the second derived interlacing pattern Fig. 23, thick chain line is given by LP x 120 18 x 120 2,160 6 x 360 , that is, as it has been said, six great circles. We observe now that the here described second interlacing pattern, considered by itself alone, localizes upon the sphere an equilateral sphere polyhedron of the icosi dodecahedric type, having in all 32 equilateral faces, twelve of which are pentagonal and twenty are triangular, all having equal sides having each the value LPL 360 as viewed from the sphere centre therefore, we have here a dodecahedron and an icosahedron, each other interpenetrated and alternate, Since in this case Fig., 23 we have thought that the eye is better than in Fig. 21 helped to reconstruct the sphere polyhedron, we have avoided, in order not to complicate without need the drawing, to have recourse to the device, then sdopted, of marking by the same number enclosed in a small circle the arcs pertaining to the same great circle. C The third derived interlacing pattern , indic ated by the dotted line, always in the same Fig. 23, is composed by ten great circles in all. It is obtainable by tracing all the possible diagonals of the pentagonal faces which appear in the previous interlacing pattern that is, the second one .In this way twelve pentagonal Pythagoreans stars are obtained, which are distributed regularly upon the whole sphere, and which form, altogether, the third derived inters lacing pattern a Turning to the computations, we find that each diagonal of the pentagon, that is each side of the star , measures 600 always viewed from the sphere centre , so that, in all, recalling that each pentagonal star has five sides and that the pentagonal stars are in all twelwe, we will get for the whole third derived interlacing pattern a global development of 12 x 5 x 600 3.600 , corresponding, as it has already been said, to ten great circles.Finally, in order to better evaluate and sppreciate th two derived interlacing patterns of Fig. 23, we have thought better to draw them apsrt, without the basic interlacing pattern which has generated them. We have thus given in Fig. 24 the representation of a hemisphere, viewed from the top, constituted by the two said derived interlacing patterns the sec ond one, as usually indicated by B chain line, shows clearly in a hemisphere six pentagonal and ten triangular fares, while the third one,, usually indicated by a dotted line, presents, always in a hemisphere, six pentagonal complete Pytnagoroan stars. D The fourth derived interlacing pattern, indicated in Fig. 26 by a more marked continuous line, differs in some way from the previously described derived patterns, since,while these were all composed of complete great circles, the present pattern is, on the contrary, composed of s set of short great circle arcs each of them, with reference to Fig. 25, measures NQN 2 x NQ 2 x 120,93931844 250,87863688 viewed always from the sphere centre .For convenience and clarity of drawing, it has been assumed, also in the Fig. 25 to operate upon a plane instead of a spherical surface, The fourth derived interlacing pattern comprises altogether 62 equilateral faces each having sidea of the value NQN 25 ,87863688 , of which thirty are spher ical squares, twenty are spherical triangles and twelve are spherical pentagons, as it appears from the already dy mentioned Fig. 26. Said interlacing pattern may be thought, as generated through the following process always with reference to Fi . 25 comprising four basic 3rd species triankles concurring with their four 90 angles into forming a binary symmetry apex , let us draw, for each right angle the corresponding bisector, and consider the point N in which Beid bisector meets the hypotenuse MC. Drowning finally from the point N the two NQ arcs, perpendicular to the two catheti of each basic triangle,we find the side of the generic face of the equilateral pattern, which, as already said, is just given by I5QN 2 x NQ 250,87863688. An examination of Figs.23,24,26 may serve to nail down the already expressed concept that,in general, the derived patterns,once suppressed the basic generating interlacing pattern,msy appear,at first sight, as interlacing patterns having their own individuali ty,i.e.conceived in an autonomous and independent way. Qn the basis. of what has been abovesaid,this is an illusive impression,which by a more accurate check may be dispelled,through the location of the symmetry axes, Finally, as a consideration relating to the utilization of the constructive system which i s object of the invention, we want to point out that,by it,spheri cal, hemispherical and pa rtially spherical bodies can be realized, apted to the most various uses, ss for instance spherical containers for nuclear reactors, man made satellites, cupolas for insulation from the external ambient for industrial plants, and so on, and this within a range of sizes which may go from the very small up to the very largè one,
