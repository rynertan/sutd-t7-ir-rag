# Apparatus for the non contact disintegration of stony objects present in a body by means of sound shockwaves.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the non contact disintegration of concre ments present in a body by means of sound shockwaves, in which the sound shockwaves are generated in one focus of at least one liquid filled reflector formed in a reflector block, said reflector exhibiting rotary symmetry and having the form of a semi ellipsoid, or in the focal line of a toroidal reflector having a semi elliptical cross sectional configuration, said reflector focussing said sound shockwaves in a second focus, and comprising a liquid filled coupling member 7 connected to said reflector block in a liquid tight manner, which coupling member is movable relatively to said reflector and can be placed in contact with the skin of said body, the coupling member having a construction co axial with the reflector, with which, in a first adjustment position, by axial shifting, the second focus of the reflector can be adjusted to the correct depth in the body, and then, in a second adjustment position, the angular position 18 of the reflector can be adjusted so that the reflector axis is caused to coincide with the concre ment to be disintegrated, or the other way round.
