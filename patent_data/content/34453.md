## Description
CELLULAR COMPOSITES AND PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE. The present invention relates to a constructional article suitable for use in the building or engineering industries as a building or load bearing member or a core material, for example, as a substitute for wood or metal. J E Gordon and G Jeronimidis have described in Nature,Volume 252, Nov 8, 1974 at page 116, composite models resembling timber made by glueing together in parallel relationship a number of individual tubes formed by winding glass and carbon fibres into hollow helices with resin. The composite models were said to have experimental works of fracture up to about 40 x 104Jm 2 German patent application 2836418 discloses a constructional material for lightweight sandwich elements manufactured by assembling together in parallel relationship a plurality of small diameter tubes to form a close packed array, soaking the tubes with synthetic resin and curing the resin to form a so called core filling material. US Patent no 3673058 discloses a honeycomb core constructed of a plurality of generally sinusoidally shaped sheets or ribbons which are bonded together at the nodes of adjacent ribbons to form generally hexagonal shaped cells. The present invention in its broadest aspect provides a rigid multitubular constructional article comprising a sheet or ribbon of constructional material, which may be fibre reinforced, convoluted to form a series of tubular cells, which simulates the structurally efficient arrays of hollow cells observed in timber without the need to bond together individual tube units. Each of the hollow tubular cells walls of the present invention has the form of a portion of a sheet or ribbon of rigid material which folds back on itself i.e. is convoluted to form the individual tubular cell. A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a rigid multitubular constructional article comprising a sheet or ribbon of constructional material convoluted to form a series of substantially parallel alternating folds, adjacent folds being in longitudinal bonded contact to give a series of substantially parallel tubular cells. The constructional material forming the constructional article of the present invention can comprise, for example, metal, plastics or a cementitious composition. The constructional material preferably comprises a cured synthetic resin, for example, cure unsaturated polyester resin, phenolic resin or epoxy resin. The constructional material is preferably reinforced with fibrous reinforoement. The fibres within such fibrous reinforcement can comprise, for example, straight, curved, tangled, woven or non woven fibres. The fibres can be, for example, stiff, flexible or soft hand fibres. Preferably the fibres have good tensile strength. The fibrous reinforcement can be, for example, mineral, synthetic or natural fibre, for example, glass fibre, carbon fibre, aramid fibre, polyamide fibre, wood fibre, annual crop fibre or hydrid fibres. Glass fibre is preferred. Where fibrous reinforcement is present in the constructional article of the present invention the fibres may lie at any angle to the axes of the tubular cells or tubular elements, i.e. the angles lie within the range 0 to 900 in relation to said axes. Preferably the fibres lie in directions which are not parallel to the axes of the tubular cells or tubular elements. For example, it is preferred that the angle or angles between the axis of each tubular cell and the fibres contained in the wall thereof lie in the range Oc to 450, most preferably 50 to 300 for improved toughness in the article. The angle referred to is the angle at a point x between 1 an imaginary plane containing the longitudinal axis of the tubular cell wall and cutting a fibre at the point x and 2 the fibre itself.In the case of a curved fibre, as for example in a cylindircal tubular cell wall, 2 is the tangent to the fibre at the point x .However, the fibres may be randomly oriented in relation to the axes of the tubular elements if desired. The invention further comprises a process for manufacturing a rigid multitubular constructional article in accordance with the present invention comprising winding a web of reinforcing fibre between two rows of closely spaced parallel former rods the web being impregnated with curable resin and disposed between the rods in the form of a series of parallel alternating folds so that adjacent folds are in longitudinal contact, and causing the resin to cure. The impregnation of the web with the curable resin can be carried out before or after the web is wounc on the former rods, or during the winding process itself. The rigid multitubular constructional article of the present invention can be manufactured directly in the form of a wide variety of useful articles, e.g. a beam element, a lintel or a panel, or can undergo further fabrication operations, e.g. machining, lamination or filling to form useful articles. The invention is further described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a process for manufacturing the constructional article of the present invention, Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a glass fibre reinforced polyester resin constructional article according to the present invention, and Fig. 3 shows a cut away view of a laminated article embodying the constructional article. In Fig. 1 two parallel rows A and B of closely spaced formerrods made from cylindrical rods of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE or steel rods coated with PTFE are set up in a square frame not shown . As each rod is introduced, in the order A1, B1, A2B2 woven glass fabric D impregnated with heat curable polyester resin is wound around the rod to form the series of parallel alternating folds C1, C2, C3 etc. It is preferred to use a resin that does not shrink excessively, and most preferably expands slightly, on curing to facilitate later removal of the rods. Thie resin impregnated fabric optionally can be introduced so that neither the warp nor weft thereof lie parallel to the axes of the rods, i.e. the fabric is wound on the bias with respect to the axes of the rods and so that the resin bridges adjacent folds, e.g. at E 2 E2 .. etc.In Fig. 1, the folds at E1 E2 , are shown slightly separated for clarity but in practise the adjacent folds are in longitudinal contact at least during the curing of the resin. The rods are then longitudinally tensioned in the frame by conventional means and the frame is placed in an oven until curing is complete. The former rods are then withdrawn to give the constructional article shown in Fig. 2. InFig. 1 the distance separating the axes of the parallel rows of formerrods is shown as just over one rod diameter for clarity. Whilst this distance can be increased or decreased as desired, it is preferred to use as short a distance as possible to give increased strength to the final article. The general technique described in the preceding paragraph can be employed to produce a variety of different constructional articles in accordance with the present invention. For example, the web may be conventionally woven or triaxially woven fabric, a non woven fabric, a pre preg, a mat or may be built up from filament, spun thread or rovings. The former rods can have any desired cross sectional shape, for example circular, elliptical, square or triangular. They may be slightly tapered to facilitate removal from the produced article. The distance separating the parallel rows of former rods can be varied to increase or decrease the thickness of the produced multitubular constructional article as desired. The spacing between adjacent rods within each row must be such that the adjacent folds in the resin impregnated web contact one another. The resin employed to impregnate the web can be any curable resin, for example, resins crosslinkavle by chemical or thermal treatment. Figures 4, 5, 6 7 show diagrammatically a method of producing a rigid multitubular constructional article according to the present invention. Figure 4 shows a perspective view of two oppositely disposed fork members 7, 8 situated one above the other and a horizontal sheet of curable resin impregnated woven glass fibre 9 situated between the forks. The ends of the impregnated sheet are maintained under tension. The forks are slideably mounted on a jig so that they can be moved in a vertical direction. The fork 7 comprises a row of former rods F1 F2 F3, each rod being slideably mounted at one end in a channel member 10. The fork 8 comprises former rods G1 G2...., mounted in channel member 11 in a similar manner.Figure 5 shows a cross sectional view through the formerrods and the resin impregnated fibre. To form the article the two fork members are moved towards each other so that one set of former rods passes through the spaces between the other set to give the arrangement shown in cross section in Fig 6, the tension in the sheet being relaxed slightly to allow the sheet to take up the serpentine path shown in Fig 6. The former rods within each row are then mechanically urged together so that the ends slide towards one another within the channel members, until the former rods and sheet take up the arrangement shown in cross section inFig 7.The curable resin is then cured by heating, and finally the produced article is removed from the rods. The produced article has a shape similar to the article depicted in Fig 2. The rigid multitubular constructional article of the present invention finds a variety of uses in the construction and engineering industries for example as a replacement for timber or metal in flooring, roofing or partitioning applications. It may be employed, for example, in sheet or strip form or a plurality of sheets or strips may be laminated or cross laminated together to form thicker sections or blocks. The multitubular constructional article of the present invention can if desired be laminated with conventional materials, for example sheet metal, timber or synthetics. Fig 3 shows a laminate built up from strips 2, 3, of the constructional article of the present invention bonded together side by side at their longitudinal lines of contact 4 and skinned over with sheets 5, 6 of a sheet material, for example, timber or synthetic or metal sheet.A laminate of this type can be used, for example, as a light weight flooring material. Alternatively, if desired, lintels, sheets or panels for example, may be formed in accordance with the constructional article of the present invention wherein the axes of the tubular elements lie along the axis of the lintel or parallel to the surface of the sheet or panel. Figure 8 shows diagramatically in cross section a rigid multitibular constructional article according to the present invention formed by winding a resin impregnated fabric 20 around two rows of former rods, the first row 21 having a larger diameter than the second row 22. The rods wound with resin impregnated fabric are shown slightly separated from one another in the diagram for the sake of clarity. In practise the adjacent folds of resin impregnated fabric, e.g. 23,24, contact one another so that they bond together during the curing. As can be seen from Figure 8, the article produced by curing the resin and withdrawing the former rods has a curved profile. If desired, additional former rods may be employed to form two concentric rings of former rods and thus produce an article having the form of a pipe.
