# Methods of making cathode electrodes for sodium sulphur cells.

## Abstract
A cathode structure for a sodium sulphur cell is formed by putting a fibre matrix 50 into a mould 41, 42, 43, 44 which is closed to shape the matrix to the required form with compression of the fibrous material, the mould being kept at a temperature below 12 C and preferably between 8 and 10 C while liquid sulphur is injected into the compressed fibre material.
