## Description
This invention is concerned with a machine for use in lasting side portions of shoe uppers. The term shoe where used herein is used generically as indicating articles of outer footwear generally, including such articles in the course of manufacture. In GB A 1378631 is described a machine for lasting side portions of shoe uppers comprising a support for a shoe last on which an upper, the side portions of which are to be lasted, and an insole are positioned, and two side lasting assemblies arranged to act on opposite side portions of an upper positioned on a last supported by said support, wherein each side lasting assembly comprises clamping means, comprising at least one clamp member, movable towards the support to clamp a side portion of the upper against its last at a locality spaced from the feather line thereof, lasting element means comprising a plurality of lasting elements arranged side by side and movable inwardly towards the support so as to cause lasting marginal portions of the side portion of the upper to be wiped over corresponding marginal portions of the insole and be pressed there against, and lasting band means comprising at least one band portion of flexible sheet material arranged to be interposed between the shoe upper on the one hand and the lasting elements and the clamp member s on the other, whereby the side portions of the upper are clamped as aforesaid by the clamp members acting through the band portions the or each band portion of each side lasting assembly being connected at one end to the lasting elements of said assembly. In GB A 1559171 is described a side lasting machine in which each side lasting assembly comprises a single lasting band which is supported at its upper and lower edges, the arrangement being such that, as the lasting band is moved inwardly towards the last support, a portion thereof intermediate its upper and lower edges first engages the upper in the waist region, continued movement thereafter causing the upper to be deformed in the direction of both the top line and the feather line. The inward movement of each assembly, furthermore, is limited by a presser pad between which and the upper the lasting band is interposed, which pad also assists in holding the upper in position against the last during the lasting operation. When the inward movement of each lasting band is arrested, the lasting marginal portions of the upper, which are already partially folded over the feather line by the action of the inward movement of the lasting band, is merely rolled over and pressed against corresponding marginal portions of the insole by presser feet, which serve also to support one edge of the lasting band. It will thus be appreciated that, in the operation of this machine, no significant drafting of the upper, in the waist portion thereof, takes place but rather the upper is deformed to the shape of the last by the progressive application of pressure thereto from an intermediate point outwardly towards the top line and feather line. Furthermore, the action of the presser feet is merely to roll the lasting marginal portion of the upper over the insole edge without any inward wiping action being applied thereto. In US A 1722499 is described a machine having side lasting assemblies, each of which comprises a plurality of lasting devices, each device in turn comprising a lasting element in the form of a wiping finger, a strap of flexible material one end of which is secured to the wiping finger, and the other end also being secured to a portion of the assembly, and a clamp pad between which and the upper the strap is interposed. In the operation of this machine, each device operates independently of the others, the arrangement being such that each assembly is moved bodily towards the shoe and the presser pads are brought into pressing engagement with the band against the upper, thus to clamp the upper against the last at a locality closely adjacent the feather line. Thereafter, the pressure applied by the pads is increased as the wipers move inwardly to wipe lasting marginal portions of the upper against corresponding marginal portions of the insole and press them thereagainst. Thereafter, the wiping fingers are cammed down from an out of the way position to lay the lasting marginal portions of the upper over corresponding marginal portions of the insole and press them thereagainst. A further modification of this machine is described in US A 1843232. In this machine, the straps are secured to the clamp members at one end and are resiliently connected at the other to the wiping fingers, the arrangement being such that the wiping fingers effect an in wiping action effectively on the strap rather than on the upper, the resilient connection yielding during such inwiping movement so that the wiping fingers move relative to their associated straps. The overall effect of this arrangement is that the lasting marginal portions of the upper are again merely laid over corresponding marginal portions of the insole and pressed thereagainst. In GB A 1079611 are described two lasting machines, in a first of which two side lasting assemblies are provided, each comprising a plurality of lasting bands which are pressed against the upper by clamp members in the form of fingers the bands being capable of limited movement heightwise of the last thus to provide an updraft on the upper prior to lasting marginal portions thereof being folded over the insole edge and pressed against corresponding marginal portions of the insole. In this machine, however, no separate lasting elements are provided, the bands serving the function of both updrafting and overlaying members. Again, in GB A 1339835, a machine is described having two side lasting assemblies, each comprising a plurality of lasting elements and a plurality of bands, but in this case no clamping pads are provided, the upper merely being engaged by the bands which are drawn over the insole edge, together with lasting marginal portions of the upper, during the in wiping movement of the lasting elements. In the side lasting of shoes, problems arise where the inside of the last, at the waist region, is significantly inclined or rounded, so that it is difficult to ensure that the material of the upper, which is relatively bulky, is properly bedded down to the last before the lasting marginal portions of the upper are secured to corresponding marginal portions of the insole. Thus, it is not always sufficient merely to rely on the in wiping action of wiping fingers to ensure that the upper is properly bedded to the last, nor it is necessarily sufficient merely to press the upper against the last without any drafting force being first applied. On the other hand, the use of wiping fingers or similar lasting elements is advantageous in ensuring a sharp feather edge on the finished shoe and also an adequate bedding down of the lasting marginal portions on to corresponding marginal portions of the isole, so that the mere application of an updrafting force does not in itself necessarily provide a good result in the finished shoe. Furthermore, it is desirable that clamp pads be provided so that a controlled drafting force can be applied to the upper, thus ensuring that any displacement of the upper does not lead to its being badly positioned on the last prior to the waist lasting operation. It is thus the object of the present invention to provide a machine for lasting side portions of shoes, wherein the upper is properly conformed to the last, regardless of the shape of the latter in the waist region, by the application of a controlled drafting force, and also in the operation of which lacting marginal portions of the upper are wiped over corresponding marginal portions of the insole and pressed thereagainst using conventional lasting elements. This object is resolved in accordance with the invention, in a machine as set out in the second paragraph of this specification, in that the or each band portion of each side lasting assembly is flexible but substantially non stretchable and is yieldingly secured at its end opposite to the lasting elements, whereby inward movement of the lasting elements to wards the support as aforesaid is effective to draw the band portion s heightwise of the shoe in a direction from the top line to the teather line thereof, and in that the or each band portion is pressed by the clamp member s against the side portion of the upper as aforesaid under a pressure which, as the or each band portion is so drawn by the inward movement of the lasting elements, allows the band portion s to slide between the last and the clamp member s but by which the or each band portion is pressed against the shoe upper sufficiently cause the portion of the upper engaged thereby to be drafted on its last in said direction. It will thus be appreciated that, using a machine in accordance with the invention, the lasting elements are utilised to apply a controlled drafting force to the upper through the band portion s , the control being specifically achieved by the action of the clamp member s acting on the band portion s . Desirably, the upper engaging surface of the or each band portion is such as to cause the upper to be frictionally engaged thereby, thus to apply a drafting force to the upper as aforesaid and at least one of the opposite surface of the or each band portion and the surface of the or each clamp member engaging such opposite surface is a low friction surface. Thus, for example, the aforementioned surface of the each clamp member may be of polytetrafluoroethylene. Conveniently, furthermore, the or each band portion may be made of a laminated sheet material having a first layer which comprises the upper engaging surface and which provides sufficient friction to apply a drafting force the upper engaged thereby, and a second layer which comprises a low friction surface which is engaged by the clamping member s . In order further to ensure that the drafting force applied by the band portion s is controlled, desirably the sheet material from which the or each portion is made has a modulus not less than 586.24 N cm² 850 p.s.i. at 100 elongation as per the ASTM test procedure . The holding pressure applied by the clamp member s to the upper engaging band portion s is preferably of the order of 13.79 N cm² 20 lbs sq. in. . Furthermore, preferably the or each clamp member is mounted for pivotal movement about an axis extending heightwise of the last. Where the clamping means comprises a plurality of clamp members, desirably the position of each such axis in relation to its clamp member, and also the cross secional shape, viewed along said axis, of each clamp member, are such as to enable the clamp members to pivot without adjacent members binding on one another. For effecting movement of the clamp member s towards the last support as aforesaid, preferably fluid pressure operated means is provided. In addition, preferably locking means, e.g. a bar lock arrangement associated with the or each clamp member, is also provided for locking the clamp member s in position after having been moved towards the last support to hold the band portion s as aforesaid. The machine in accordance with the invention is preferably constructed and arranged in such a manner that operation of the fluid pressure operated means is also effective to cause inward movement of the lasting elements to take place, further fluid pressure operated means also being provided for effecting further inward movement of the lasting elements, when the or each clamp member is holding the band portion s against the upper as aforesaid. Conveniently, such further inward movement of the lasting elements is through a predetermined distance. Furthermore, conveniently in the operation of the machine, after lasting marginal portions of the upper have been wiped over corresponding marginal portions of the insole as aforesaid under the action of
