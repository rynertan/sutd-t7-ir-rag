## Description
TITLE FLUORINATION PROCESS FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to a continuous process for manufacturing fluorinated derivatives of alkanes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most commercial methods for producing fluorine containing hydrocarbons are based on the reaction wherein hydrogen fluoride and haloalkanes containing halogen other than fluorine are reacted in the presence of antimony chloride catalysts see, for example, U.S. 2,005,705 and U.S. 2,005,708 . The reaction is that of replacing a nonfluorine halogen C1, Br or I of the haloalkane with fluorine of the hydrogen fluoride. Most generally, the haloalkanes are chloroalkanes because of their availability and their tendency to undergo fewer side reactions during the exchange reaction than their corresponding bromo or iodo analogues. The above mentioned fluorination reaction may be represented by the following equation using chloroform as the illustrative haloalkane EMI1.1 tb SEP Antimony tb SEP Chloride tb x SEP HF SEP SEP CHC13 SEP Catalyst SEP SEP CHCl3xFx SEP SEP x SEP HC1 SEP I tb where x is 1 3. Generally, a mixture of fluorinateR products represented by CHIC13 XFX is obtained which contains CHC12F, CHC1F2 and CHF3, the particular proportion of these components depending upon the reactant ratios and the reaction conditions. Usually hydrogen fluoride is used in excess to insure maximum utilization of the haloalkane reactant.Therefore, the crude reaction product from the reaction will contain HF as well as a mixture of CHC12F, CHC1F2, CHF3 and HCl. It will be noted from the above equation that for each mole of hydrogen fluoride undergoing the exchange reaction, one mole equivalent of hydrogen chloride is generated. The process is usually carried out continuously by cofeeding hydrogen fluoride and haloalkane into antimony chloride catalyst. Usually, a small amount of chlorine is also added to generate and to maintain the antimony in the pentavalent state. The production of chlorofluoroalkanes by reaction of a haloalkane with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of antimony pentachloride catalyst has been used commercially for many years. However, as energy costs increase, the process becomes correspondingly more expensive and less attractive. For example, in the fluorination of chloroform the crude reaction products include CHC12F b.p. 8.90C , CHClF2 b.p. 40080C , CHF3 b.p. 820C , HCl b.p. 850C and HF b.p. 19.40C . These reaction products must be separated from each other by cost effective means. The conventional method of separation has been by a series of distillations which require a lot of energy for refrigeration and a high investment in pressurized equipment.Also, closeness in the boiling points of CHF3 820C and HC1 850C add to the difficulty and cost of the separation. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an economical, energy efficient, continuous process for the production of fluorinated haloalkanes. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a continuous haloalkane fluorination process which will provide crude fluorinated products substantially free of hydrogen halides. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a haloalkane fluorination process which minimizes costs associated with the separation of reaction products. These and other objects will be apparent from the description provided herein. DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a continuous process for fluorinating haloalkanes containing at least one nonfluorine halogen atom comprising, 1 contacting antimony pentachloride with hydrogen fluoride in a first zone to replace at least a portion of chlorine in said antimony pentachloride with fluorine, 2 transferring the thus fluorinated antimony pentachloride to a second zone wherein the fluorination of antimony pentachloride to antimony chlorofluoride is essentially completed and hydrogen chloride generated in said fluorination of antimony pentachloride is separated from the antimony chlorofluoride. 3 transferring the antimony chlorofluoride to a third zone wherein said antimony chlorofluoride is contacted with said haloalkane to replace at least a portion of the nonfluorine halogen atoms of said haloalkane with fluorine, 4 removing spent antimony chlorofluoride from said third zone into a fourth zone wherein said spent antimony chlorofluoride is freed of volatile material and then recycled to the first zone for refluorination with hydrogen fluoride and 5 removing fluorinated haloalkanes from said third zone to a separation means to recover fluorinated haloalkanes essentially free of hydrogen halide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Reference is made to the attached drawing for a more detailed explanatin of the invention using chloroform as the starting haloalkane reactant.Antimony pentachloride is introduced into first zoneA via lines 1 and 3 while hydrogen fluoride is introduced into zone A via lines 2 and 3. The hydrogen fluoride reacts with the antimony pentachloride in zone A replacing a portion of the chlorine atoms with fluorine. The reaction in this first zone can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 600C to about 1400C. A preferred temperature range is from about 700C to about 1200C, while a temperature between about 900C and 1000C is most preferred. The chemical reaction taking place in zone A may be represented by the following equation EMI4.1 The reaction mixtures from zone A is transferred via line 4 to the second zone B which is a degassing vessel maintained at essentially the same temperature as the first zone. The reaction of hydrogen fluoride with antimony pentachloride proceeds to completion in zone B if it is not already completed in zone A.Hydrogen chloride formed in the fluorination of the antimony pentachloride is removed from zone B via scrubber 5 and exit line 6. The introduction of antimony pentachloride via line 15 to scrubber 5 in a countercurrent fashion at juncture 16 assists in consuming any unreacted hydrogen fluoride that would otherwise be removed along with hydrogen chloride. The antimony chlorofluoride in zone B is transferred via line 7 to a third zone C, the haloalkane reactor, wherein it is contacted with chloroform introduced into C via line 8. The haloalkane reactor C is operated in the temperature range of from about 600C to 1500C, preferably from about 75iC to about 1250C. Chlorine may also be introduced into C via line 9 to maintain the antimony in the pentavalent state. The chemical reaction proceeding in C may be represented by the following equation EMI5.1 wherein CSC13 xFx represents a mixture of mono , di and trifluorinated products. It will be noted from the above reaction that there are no hydrogen halides to separate from the fluorinated products. The spent antimony chlorofluoride in zone C i.e., regenerated antimony pentachloride is passed via line 10 into a fourth zone D which is a degassing vessel wherein any unreacted haloalkane and or fluorinated haloalkanes in the spent antimony chlorofluoride are allowed to separate from the spent antimony chlorofluoride and recycled to the haloalkane reactor C via line 11. Such separation may be facilitated by methods well known in the art such as by reduction in pressure or by heating. The spent antimony chlorofluoride in zone D is then transferred via line 12 and pump 13 back to the first zone A. To alleviate contamination of the antimony pentachloride catalyst by arsenic compounds which are introduced into the system as impurities in the hydrogen fluoride, a small portion of the spent antimony chlorofluoride exiting from the pump 13 may be removed via line 14 and a corresponding amount of fresh antimony pentachloride may be introduced into the system via line 1. The fluorinated products formed in the haloalkane reactor C which include dichloromonofluoromethane, monochlorodifluoromethane and trifluoromethane are transferred via line 17 to a distillation column E wherein the desired fluorinated products are separated. In contrast to prior art processes, the fluorinated products are essentially free of hydrogen halides, and therefore, the separation of the fluorinated products by distillation is easier and much less costly. The manner in which the distillation column is operated depends upon the particular component of the product mixture desired.For example, if chloroform is being fluorinated with the objective of producing monochlorodifluoromethane as the chief end product, it would be recovered via line 20 while dichloromonofluoromethane and tr ifluoromethane would be recycled to the haloalkane reactor C via lines 18 and 19, the former to be fluorinated further and the latter used to assist in stripping the fluorinated products from the antimony chlorofluoride. Higher boiling materials such as unreacted chloroform may also be recycled to C via line 19. When excessive amounts of trifluoromethane build up in the system, they may be recovered via line 21. The fluorinated haloalkanes produced by the process are useful as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, solvents and intermediates. The hydrogen fluoride used to convert antimony pentachloride to antimony chlorofluoride may be a pure product or a commercial grade of hydrogen fluoride which may contain small amounts of impurities. The presence of water in the reactants is not desirable, and therefore it is preferable to use substantially anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The hydrogen fluoride may be either gaseous or liquid hydrogen fluoride. The antimony chloride used is generally in the pentavalent form, but it may contain up to about 10 of the antimony in the trivalent form. In order to maintain a desired high level of pentavalent antimony, chlorine gas may be introduced into the reactor to reoxidize any trivalent antimony formed by the action of reducing compounds present in the system. The fluorination of antimony pentachloride with hydrogen fluoride may be carried out in the temperature range of from about 600C to 1400C, preferably in the range of from about 700C to 1200C, most preferably in the range of from about 900C to about 1200C. The pressure may be atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric. It is preferred to use superatmospheric pressures, particularly when the fluorination of antimony pentachloride is carried out in the higher temperature ranges indicated. The degree of fluorination of antimony pentachloride may be varied over a wide range such that fluorinated antimony chlorides contain from about 2 to about 40 by weight of fluorine. It is preferred that the fluorine content be in the range from about 3 to about 10 for ease of handling and to minimize the corrosivity of the fluorinated antimony pentachloride towards certain metals.Since the fluorinated antimony chlorides are liquids at ordinary temperatures, particularly when the trivalent antimony does not exceed about 10 , they may be transferred to the degassing vessel B and subsequently to haloalkane reactor C using the pressure generated by the hydrogen chloride formed in the fluorination of the pentavalent antimony chloride in vessel A, or by introduction of a pressurized inert gas such as nitrogen. It is preferred to use hydrogen chloride since the use of other gases, such as nitrogen, will necessitate their separation at a later stage of the operation. The use of a mechanical pump to move fluorinated antimony chloride is to be avoided because of the corrosive nature of the fluorinated antimony chloride towards materials of construction. The degasser B is kept at a temperature approximating that of the antimony pentachloride fluorinator there being no requirement to cool or heat the antimony chlorofluoride in the degasser although, if desired, heating may be used. The pressure in the degasser B should be less than the pressure in the antimony pentachloride fluorinator A in order to transfer the fluorinated antimony chloride from the fluorinator to the degasser using pressure differentials and to facilitate the separation of hydrogen halide from the fluorinated antimony chloride. The fluorinated antimony chloride is kept in the degasser for such time Åas to complete the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with antimony pentachloride and to essentially separate the by product hydrogen chloride from the reaction mass.Usually the reaction of hydrogen fluoride and the desorption of by product hydrogen chloride is rapid enough that a few minutes residence in the degasser is sufficient to accomplish these two objectives. The hydrogen chloride separated at the degasser is ordinarily free of hydrogen fluoride but as an extra precaution against hydrogen fluoride contamination, the exiting hydrogen chloride stream can be contacted with fresh antimony pentachloride or with spent antimony chlorofluoride which will react with hydrogen fluoride present. The hydrogen chloride can be collected as anhydrous hydrogen chloride or dissolved in water to form hydrochloric acid. Contact between reactants in the haloalkane fluorination reactor C can be accomplished by conventional mixing methods such as by countercurrent flow, back mixing, etc. The temperature in this fluorinator is usually maintained in the range of from about 600C to about 1500C, preferably from about 700C to about 1200C. As previously mentioned, the pressure may be atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric, but generally it is preferred to use superatmospheric pressures of up to about 20 atmospheres, particularly when the haloalkane to be fluorinated is a one carbon atom haloalkane. An important consideration in the choice of pressure is that it is preferable to use a pressure that will maintain the antimony halide in the liquid phase while allowing vaporization of fluorinated haloalkanes. The temperature employed, the mol ratio of haloalkane to antimony chlorofluoride, and the contact time between the antimony chlorofluoride and the haloalkane used will depend upon the degree of fluorination of the antimony pentachloride and the end product that is desired. Generally, a combination of a high level of haloalkane with a low degree of fluorination of antimony pentachloride will favor monofluorination whereas a combination of a low level of haloalkane with a high degree of fluorination in the antimony pentachloride will favor multiple fluorination. In either case, the fluorinated haloalkanes obtained will be a mixture of fluorinated compounds. The notable feature of the present invention is that in contrast to the prior art processes, these fluorinated haloalkanes are produced without the coproduction of equivalent amounts of hydrogen halide.If the antimony chlorofluoride is thoroughly degassed of hydrogen halide before introduction into the haloalkane fluorination reactor, the fluorinated haloalkane produced will be completely free of hydrogen halide.Generally, the amount of hydrogen halide present in the crude fluorinated haloalkane will be considerably less than 5 of that obtained in prior art processes where haloalkane is reacted with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of antimony halide catalysts. The present invention thus provides the advantages of producing crude fluorinated haloalkane substantially free of hydrogen fluoride which makes the recovery of fluorinated haloalkanes considerably easier and more economical by eliminating a number of distillation systems which would have required high pressures and costly refrigeration and at the same time provides commercially valuable hydrogen chloride as a by product. The term whaloalkanet is meant to include those alkanes substituted with at least one halogen atom other than a fluorine atom, the halogen atoms being those of chlorine, bromine and iodine. The haloalkane may also contain fluorine atoms provided there is present at least one nonfluorine halogen atom. The term haloalkane is also intended to include those combinations of olefins and halogens which theoretically form haloalkanes during reaction for example, a combination of trichloroethylene and chlorine or a combination of tetrachloroethylene and chlorine. The preferred haloalkanes are those wherein the halogen substituent is chlorine since they are lower in cost and readily available and have less tendency to undergo side reactions in the fluorinator such as rearrangement reactions.Theoretically, any haloalkane which can be readily introduced into the haloalkane fluorinator can be used in the present process, but haloalkanes containing from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms are usually employed. Preferred haloalkanes are those containing 1 to 2 carbon atoms while those containing one carbon atom are most preferred. The preferred haloalkanes of two carbon atoms are pentachloroethane and hexachloroethane. These haloalkanes may be directly supplied to the haloalkane fluorination reactor, or they may be supplied by the introduction of a combination of trichloroethylene and chlorine or a combination of tetrachloroethylene and chlorine to the haloalkane fluorinator. These combinations respectively form pentachloroethane and hexachloroethane in situ. The preferred one carbon atom haloalkanes are chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. The following examples further illustrate the invention. Unless otherwise specified, all percentages are by weight.EXAMPLE 1 Fluorination of antimony pentachloride with liquid hydrogen fluoride was carried out in a wTeflont polytetrafluoroethylene cylinder of 115 ml capacity. Antimony pentachloride 70.6 g was placed in the cylinder and the cylinder was connected to a hydrogen fluoride cylinder. The antimony pentachloride in the Teflon cylinder was frozen by packing the lower end of the cylinder in solid carbon dioxide. After the antimony pentachloride was frozen, the cylinder was evacuated and hydrogen fluoride 49.0 g was transferred to the Teflon cylinder by distillation from the hydrogen fluoride cylinder.After disconnection from the hydrogen fluoride cylinder, the Teflon cylinder was connected to a drying tube which, in turn, was connected to a gas bubbler containing liquid trichlorotrifluoroethane to observe the evolution of hydrogen chloride. The Teflon cylinder was maintained at 8 120C overnight after which time the evolution of hydrogen chloride ceased. The contents of the cylinder was purged with dry nitrogen and then placed under vacuum to remove any volatile material.The residue in the cylinder weighed 66.6 g which compares with the theoretical weight of 66.7 g wherein one of the five chlorides of the antimony pentachloride is replaced by fluorine. The lower outside portion of the Teflon cylinder was again packed in solid carbon dioxide and the cylinder again evacuated. Carbon tetrachloride 29.6 g was distilled into the Teflon cylinder and the contents of the cylinder was allowed to warm to room temperature. The mol ratio of the antimony chlorofluoride to carbon tetrachloride was 1.22. The outlet of the cylinder was connected to a water scrubber which, in turn, was connected to a receiver placed in solid carbon dioxide methanol bath. The cylinder was heated in an oil bath starting at 700C and up to 800C over a two hour period. The material collected in the cold receiver weighed 28.5 g.Analysis of the organic material in the receiver based upon area percent from vapor phase chromatography indicated 0.3 monochlorotrifluoromethane, 16.74 dichlorodifluoromethane, 81.3 trichloromonofluoromethane and 1.42 carbon tetrachloride. Analysis of the spent antimony chlorofluoride fluorinating agent indicated that 71.5 of the fluorine in the fluorinating agent was utilized from 7.0 fluorine down to 1.95 fluorine .EXAMPLE 2 Antimony chlorofluoride was prepared as described in Example 1 except that a stainless steel cylinder was employed in place of the Teflon cylinder, and 82.6 g of antimony pentachloride and 62 g of liquid hydrogen fluoride were used. Antimony chlorofluoride 76.5 g was reacted with 40 g of carbon tetrachloride mol ratio of fluorinating agent to carbon tetrachloride of 1.06 at 850C 900C for twenty hours. Pressure of 118 psig at 880C was developed. After cooling, the cylinder was connected to a water scrubber and thence to a receiver placed in a solid carbon dioxide methanol bath. The cylinder was heated to 420C and 15.37 g of product was collected in the receiver. Analysis of the organic material in the receiver based on area percent from vapor phase chromatography indicated the products to be 0.36 monochlorotrifluoromethane, 43.948 dichlorodifluoromethane, 49.77 trichloromonofluoromethane and 4.76 carbon tetrachloride. Analysis of the spent antimony chlorofluoride fluorinating agent indicated that 94 of the fluorine in the fluorinating agent was utilized Initial fluorine content 9.34 . Final fluorine content 0.56 . EXAMPLE 3 Antimony chlorofluoride was prepared as described above using 82.8 g antimony pentachloride and 60.8 g hydrogen fluoride. The halocarbon reacted was hexachloroethane 17 g which was added as a solid to the antimony chlorofluoride. The mol ratio of antimony chlorofluoride to hexachloroethane was 3.86. The reaction was carried out at 1450C 1600C for 20 hours during which time pressure of 65 psig at 1460C developed after 14.5 hours . On cooling the cylinder to 230C, the pressure dropped to 20 psig.Using the above described collection procedure, 6.27 g of material was collected in the receiver which material based on area percent from vapor phase chromatography was indicated to be 0.18 dichlorotetrafluoroethane, 71.77 trichlorotrifluoroethane, 16.05 tetrachlorodifluoroethane, 0.48 penta chloromonofluoroethane, 9.57 trichloromonofluoromethane and 1.728 carbon tetrachloride. Analysis of the spent antimony chlorofluoride fluorination reagent indicated that 46.4 of the fluorine in the antimony chlorofluoride was utilized Initial fluorine content 10.45 .Final fluorine content 5.6 . EXAMPLE 4 Antimony chlorofluoride was prepared as previously described from 81.6 g antimony pentachloride and 53.8 g hydrogen fluoride.Chloroform, 24.6 g, was added to the antimony chlorofluoride and the mixture heated to 750C 800C for 17 hours. The mol ratio of antimony chlorofluoride to chloroform was 1.32. The pressure in the cylinder reached 186 psig at 780C. On cooling to 35 400C, the pressure dropped to around 122 psig.On venting through a water scrubber and a receiver kept in solid carbon dioxide methanol bath, there was obtained 4.88 g of products in the cooled receiver.Analysis of the product based on area percent obtained in vapor phase chromatography indicated 10.16 trifluoromethane, 85.46 monochlorodifluoromethane, 2.248 dichloromonofluoromethane and 2.01 chloroform. Analysis of the st nt antimony chlorofluoride fluorinating agent indicated that 80.2 of the fluorine in the antimony chlorofluoride was utilized Initial fluorine content 7,448. Final fluorine content 1.47 . EXAMPLE 5 790 9 2.64 moles of antimony pentachloride was placed in a l liter stainless steel reaction vessel equipped with a condenser with ice water coolant. The vessel was heated to 900C and 52 g 2.6 moles of gaseous hydrogen fluoride was bubbled through the antimony pentachloride over a 2 hour period.After the addition of hydrogen fluoride was stopped, the content of the vessel was purged with nitrogen four times, allowing the content to come to an equilibrium for about an hour between purges.Fluorine analysis indicated that the antimony chlorofluoride contained 6.35 by weight of fluorine.EXAMPLE 6 227 g 0.8 mole of antimony chlorofluoride prepared in Example 5 was placed in a l liter stainless steel vessel equipped with a stirrer, and 93 g 0.6 mole of carbon tetrachloride was added over a period of 40 minutes with the stirrer in operation. The reaction vessel temperature ranged from 800C to 1320C. The volatile material evolved during the carbon tetrachloride addition was sampled at various times during the 40 minutes reaction time. Total volume of gas evolved was 9 liters.Gas chromatographic analyses of the samples, the time of reaction and the temperatures are summarized in the following table Time Temperature Area Percent Minutes 1 CC13F CC12F2 CClF3 CC14 8 120 77.88 12.57 2.83 6.71 12 132 50.77 39.33 5.46 4.43 16 120 46.91 44.16 4.55 4.38 24 86 35.81 58.79 2.48 2.92 34 80 49.31 46.79 1.25 2.66 Area percent is determined by dividing the area of the chromatographic peak for a particular component by the total area of all peaks. The fluorine content of the antimony chlorofluoride dropped from 6 35 to 0.11 . The hydrogen chloride content in the fluorinated product was 7.03 whereas the theoretical amount of hydrogen chloride evolved in the prior art process of cofeeding hydrogen fluoride and carbon tetrachloride to the antimony pentachloride catalyst is 38 . The presence of 7.03 hydrogen chloride in the product is probably due to incomplete removal of hydrogen chloride from antimony chlorofluoride or the presence of hydrogen fluoride in the antimony chlorofluoride.EXAMPLE 7 229 g 0.8 mole of antimony chlorofluoride prepared in Example 5 was placed in a l liter stainless steel vessel equipped with a stirrer, and 45 g 0.38 mole of chloroform was added over a 40 minute period with the stirrer in operation. The reaction vessel temperature ranged from 1000C to 1080C. Volatile material evolved during the reaction was sampled at various times and analyzed. Total volume of gas evolved was 5.4 liters.Gas chromatographic analyses of the fluorinated products, the time of reaction and the temperatures are summarized below Time Temperature Area Percent Minutes 0C CHC1F CHClF2 CHF J 12 104 4.67 64.13 31.20 18 100 5.09 43.4 51.71 27 105 27.23 31.61 41.15 36 108 35.44 57.40 6.80 The spent antimony chlorofluoride contained 2.09 fluorine Initial fluorine content 6.35 . The hydrogen chloride content in the fluorinated product was 3.8 whereas the theoretical amount of hydrogen chloride evolved in the prior art process of cofeeding hydrogen fluoride and chloroform to the antimony pentachloride catalyst is 46 .EXAMPLE 8 This example illustrates a continuous reaction of chloroform with antimony chlorofluoride in a packed tower wherein chloroform gas is contacted countercurrently with antimony chlorofluoride. 1742 g antimony chlorofluoride 5.058 fluorine at 850C to 900C prepared as described in Example 5 was added continuously through a 1 4 inch stainless steel line to the top of a 2.5 cm x 56 cm stainless steel tube packed with 6.35 mm extended stainless steel packing Pro Pak . 1130 g of chloroform gas, at 800C was fed upward from the bottom end of the stainless steel tube and contacted with the downward flowing antimony chlorofluoride. The contact time was from 2 to 40 seconds. Spent antimony chlorofluoride was collected in a vessel connected to the lower end of the reaction tube. The volatile reaction product passed from the reaction tube through a cooled condenser, a trap, two water scrubbers, gas sampling bulbs, and finally through a wet test meter. The chloroform was introduced over a 250 minute period. The temperature in the reactor tube ranged from 500C to 900C. Gas samples at 35, 60, 100, 120, 180, 210, 240 and 250 minutes were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography. The average values of these 8 analyses reported as area percentages indicated that the volatile products consisted of trifluoromethane 0.6 range of 0.24 to 0.86 , monochlorodifluoromethane 10.5 range of 1.02 to 21.83 , dichloromonofluoromethane 83.47 range of 73.21 to 93.27 , chloroform 3.1 range of 0.96 to 4.48 , trichloromonofluoromethane 1.54 range of 0.02 to 5.98 , dichlorodifluoromethane 0.2S range of 0.09 to 0.62 . The conversion of chloroform was 32 . About 93 of the available fluorine in the antimony chlorofluoride was utilized Initial fluorine content 5.05 . Final fluorine content 0.33 .
