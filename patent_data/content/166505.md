# ISOLATION AND QUANTITATION OF ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for isolating and quantitating an alkaline phosphatase comprising the steps of 1 separating the phosphatase from other enzymes in a bio logical sample 2 reacting the phosphatase from step 1 with a co enzyme precursor to produce a co enzyme 3 employing the co enzyme produced in step 2 in a series of chemical reactions at least one of which uses a chromo phore generation catalyst, to yield a chromophore, and 4 measuring the absorbance of the chromophore which is generated in step 3 .
