## Description
POLYHYDRO 3, 7 DIMETHYL 8 2 TETRAHYDRO 4 HYDROXY 6 OXO 2H PYRAN 2 YL ETHYL 1 NAPHTHYLENYL 2 METHYL BUTANOATES, CORRESPONDING HYDROXY ACIDS, PROCESS FORPREPARING AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAININGTHE SAMESUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to hypocholesteremic products from the cultivation of a micro fungus of the species Aspergillus. More specifically, it relates to compounds of the formulae EMI1.1 as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and lower alkyl and substituted alkyl esters of the carboxylic acids in which the possible substituent is phenyl, dimethylamino or acetylamino. The invention also relates to a process of cultivating the microfungus and isolating from the medium a hypocholesteremic compound of the above structures.These new compounds have excellent properties of inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and are useful against hypercholesteremia and hyperlipemia.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Because of the possible connection between high blood cholesterol and atherosclerosis, many efforts have been made to find ways and substances which would reduce the cholesterol in the mammalian body. One of these ways is to inhibit in mammals the body s ability to synthesize cholesterol. Recently, Endo et al., described U.S. 4,049,495 and 3,983,140 a fermentation product obtained by cultivation of a microorganism of the genus Penicillium and isolation from the medium. They called it ML 236 B and determined its structure together with two related compounds 236 A and 236 C. Its structure, under the name compactin, was also determined by A.G. Brown, T.C. Smale,T.J. King, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I 1165 1975 . This compound has been found to be an inhibitor, in vivo, of the biosynthesis of cholesterol.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION We have found that unexpectedly, the cultivation of a microorganism very different from that employed byEndo, a microfungus of the genus Aspergillus, produces new substances that are also very potent inhibitors of the biosynthesis of cholesterol in mammals. We have further found that these substances comprise principally the new compounds I, II, III and IV, of the above structures, accompanied by only traces of other compounds.These new compounds are much more potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in vivo than is the compound,ML236B described by Endo. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this invention include those formed from cations such as sodium, potassium, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, zinc, ammonia, ethylenediamine, N methylglucamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline, N,N dibenzylethylene diamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N benzylphenethylamine, l p chlorobenzyl 2 pyrrolidine l yl methylbenzimidazole, diethylamine, piperazine, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, and tetramethylammonium. The compounds of this invention are highly useful as antihypercholesteremic agents for the treatment of atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia and like diseases in humans. They may be administered orally or parenterally in the form of a capsule, a tablet, an injectable preparation or the like. It is usually desirable to use the oral route. Doses may be varied, depending on the age, severity, body weight and other conditions of human patients but daily dosage for adults is within a range of from about 2 mg. to 2000 mg. preferably 2 to 100 mg which may be givenin two to four divided doses. Higher doses may be favorably employed as required. The compounds of this invention also have useful antifungal activities. For example, they may be used to control strains of Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger,Cladosporium sp., Cochliobolus miyabeorus and Helminthosporium cynodnotis. For those utilities they are admixed with suitable formulating agents, powders, emulsifying agents or solvents such as aqueous ethanol and sprayed or dusted on the plants to be protected. In another aspect of this invention, it relates to a process for producing the compounds of this invention which comprises cultivating a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus and then recovering said compounds of this invention from the cultured broth. Based upon taxonomic studies, this Aspergillus, isolated and identified as a hitherto undescribed microorganism, has been designated MF 4833 in the culture collection of Merck andCo., Inc., Rahway, N.J. and a culture thereof has been placed on permanent deposit with the American Type CultureCollection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, and has been assigned accession number ATCC 20541.Another sample, of a similar organism, designated MF 4845 in theMerck culture collection, has likewise been placed on deposit and has been given the accession number ATCC 20542 The latter organism is the one giving the better yield.Although the use of these is described in connection with the process of this invention, other organisms of the genusAspergillus including mutants of the above ones are also capable of producing these novel compounds and their use is contemplated in carrying out the process of this invention. The morphological characteristics of the microorganisms MF 4833 and MF 4845 have been found to be those of the genus Aspergillus. Using the criteria specified in the standard authority Manual of the Aspergilli , CharlesThom and Kenneth B. Rasper, published by the Williams andWilkins Company, Baltimore, Md., 1945, and by comparison with knounspecies, it has been determined that both strains are Aspergillus terreus. Outstanding characteristics of both cultures of Aspergillus terreus are as follows They have conidial heads which are compact, columnar and tan deepening to brown as culture ages. The conidiophores are smooth and colorless. The vesicles are hemispherical with upper half to two thirds covered by sterigmata. Sterigmata occur in two series. The conidia are globose to slightly elliptical and smooth. The culture of these organisms to produce the novel compounds is carried out in aqueous media such as those employed for the production of other fermentation products. Such media contain sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts assimilable by the microorganism. In general, carbohydrates such as sugars, for example, glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, xylose, mannitol and the like and starches such as grains, for example, oats, ryes, cornstarch, corn meal and the like can be used either alone or in combination as sources of assimilable carbon in the nutrient medium. The exact quantity of the carbohydrate source or sources utilized in the medium depend in part upon the other ingredients of the medium but, in general, the amount of carbohydrate usually varies between about 1 and 6 by weight of the medium. These carbon sources can be used individually, or several such carbon sources may be combined in the medium. In general, many proteinaceous materials may be used as nitrogen sources in the fermentation process.Suitable nitrogen sources include for example, yeast hydrolysates, primary yeast, soybean meal, cottonseed flour, hydrolysates of casein, corn steep liquor, distiller s solubles or tomato paste and the like. The sources of nitrogen either alone or in combination, are used in amounts ranging from about 0.2 to 6 by weight of the aqueous medium. Among the nutrient inorganic salts which can be incorporated in the culture media are the customary salts capable of yielding sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, carbonate, and like ions. Also included are trace metals such as cobalt, manganese, iron and magnesium. it should be noted that the media described in the Examples are merely illustrative of the wide variety of media which may be employed, and are not intended to be limitative. Specifically, the carbon sources used in the culture media to produce the novel compounds of this invention included destrose, dextrin, oat flour, oatmeal, molasses, citrate, soybean, oil, glycerol, malt extract, cod liver oil, starch, ethanol, figs, sodium ascorbate and lard oil. Included as nitrogen sources were peptonized milk, autolyzed yeast, yeast RNA, tomato paste, casein, primary yeast, peanut meal, distillers solubles, corn steep liquor, soybean mean, corn meal,NZ amine, beef extract, asparagine, cottonseed meal and ammonium sulfate.The major ionic components were CaCO3,KH2PO4, MgSO4.7H2O and NaCl and small amounts of CaC12 6H20 and traces of Fe, Mn, Mo, B and Cu were also present. The fermentation is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 200 to 370C however, for optimum results it is preferable to conduct the fermentation at temperatures of from about 220 to 300C. The pH of the nutrient media suitable for growing the Aspergillus culture and producing the novel compounds can vary from about 6.0 to 8.0. Although the novel compounds are produced by both surface and submerged culture, it is preferred to carry out the fermentation in the submerged state. A small scale fermentation is conveniently carried out by inoculating a suitable nutrient medium with theAspergillus culture and, after transfer to a production medium, permitting the fermentation to proceed at a constant temperature of about 280C on a shaker for several days. The fermentation is initiated in a sterilized flask of medium via one or more stages of seed development. The nutrient medium for the seed stage may be any suitable combination of carbon and nitrogen sources. The seed flask is shaken in a constant temperature chamber at about 280C for 2 days, or until growth is satisfactory, and some of the resulting growth is used to inoculate either a second stage seed or the production medium.Intermediate stage seed flasks, when used, are developed in essentially the same manner, that is, part of the contents of the flask from the last seed stage are used to inoculate the production medium. The inoculated flasks are shaken at a constant temperature for several days, and at the end of the incubation period the contents of the flasks are centrifuged or filtered. For large scale work, it is preferable to conduct the fermentation in suitable tanks provided with an agitator and a means of aerating the fermentation medium. According to this method, the nutrient medium is made up in the tank and sterilized by heating at temperatures of up to about l200C. Upon cooling, the sterilized medium is inoculated with a previously grown seed of the producing culture, and the fermentation is permitted to proceed for a period of time as, for example, from 3 to 5 days while agitating and or aerating the nutrient medium and maintaining the temperature at about 280C. This method of producing the novel compounds is particularly suited for the preparation of large quantities. The compounds are conveniently isolated from the fermentation broth as lactones I and II. Alternatively they may be isolated as salts of compounds III and IV. Compounds I and II can be hydrolyzed with bases such as NaOH to yield the salts such as the sodium salts of compounds III and IV. The use of bases with other pharmaceutically acceptable cations affords salts of these cations. Careful acidification of the salts affords the hydroxy acids III and IV. The hydroxy acids III and IV, can be converted to the compounds I and II at acidic pH.Treating compounds I and II, under acidic or basic catalysis with methanol, ethanol, propanol, or butanol or with phenyl, dimethylamino, or acetylamino alkanols yields the corresponding esters of compounds III and IV which also form a part of this invention. Compounds III and IV, and especially III can be conveniently isolated without need of chromatography, in the form of the ammonium salts. This isolation is convenient and is much more adapted to commercial use than is chromatography. Furthermore, salts of III andIV are much more active than compounds I and II in vitro in the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and as antifungal agents. Indeed the hydroxy acids and their salts appear to be the active forms. Therefore, these salts are one of the especially preferred dosage forms.Preferred salts, in addition to ammonium, include tetramethylammonium, and salts of ethylenediamine, sodium, potassium, calcium, N methylglucamine, lysine, arginine and ornithine.

The clarified filtrate, pH 6.6 was adjusted to pH 4.0 by careful addition of 450 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and extracted by agitation with about one third volume 36 gal. of ethyl acetate. After separation, the upper solvent layer was removed, and the water phase again extracted with ethyl acetate 38 gal. in a similar fashion. After separation, the two extracts were conbined and back washed by agitation with about twelve gallons of water.After separation, the ethyl acetate solution was concentrated under vacuum at a temperature below 300C, first in a stirred kettle, and finally in a rotary vacuum evaporator to a residual volume of slightly less than one gallon. Approximately 1 gal. 3800 ml of ethyl acetate concentrate from the preceding extraction was further concentrated in a rotary evaporator ca 10 mm, 400C bath to a syrup and was then concentrated twice more, after addition of about one liter of methylene chloride in two portions, to free the syrup of polar solvent. The final oil of about 300 ml which contained about 250 g of solids by dry weight determination, was made up to about 750 ml with ethyl acetate methylene chloride 30 70 v v and 200 g of silica gel was added and mixed in to form a slurry. This was layered over the top of a 14 cm by 36 cm column bed holding 2.5 kg of the same silica gel, in about 7.5 1 volume, which had been packed as a slurry in the same solvent mixture. Development with the same solvent was continued until 3 liters of effluent was taken off as forerun. Development with ethyl acetate methylene chloride 50 50 v v was begun, taking 800 ml effluent fractions. Twelve fractions were taken, then 100 ethyl acetate elution was begun, and after seven more fractions, 100 acetone elution was begun.Fractions four through twenty four were assayed for bio activity in the HMG CoA Reductase inhibition assay referred to in Example 1. Substantial activity was found in fractions 7 through 11. Peak activity was found in fraction 8. It was concentrated to an oil for further purification dry wt. by solids determination was 9.0 gm. Fraction 8 from the silica gel column was triturated with 50 ml methylene chloride and filtered the dried filter cake weighed 4.9 gm. The filtrate was charged to a 2 inch I. D. by l meter long column filled with Sephadex LH 20 dextran gel Pharmacia swollen and equilibrated in methylene chloride, and the column was eluted with methylene chloride at a rate of 15 ml min. Compound I was eluted between 0.64 and 0.81 column volumes. Solvent was removed from this peak leaving a slightly brown residue weighing approximately 0.290 gm. This residue 213 mg was taken up in 1.5 ml of CH2C12 CH3CN 65 35 , charged to a prepacked and equilibrated silica gel column EM LOBAR Size B and eluted with CH2C12 CH3CN 65 35 at 5 ml min.Evaporation of solvent from the peak eluting between 235 and 360 ml of eluant left 121 mg of crystalline product, m.p. 155 1600C.

After further recrystallizations, a melting point of 170 1710C was obtained. The product was identified by spectra, etc., as compound I. This material, in the in vitro HMG CoA reductase test of Example 1 gave an 1C50 of 0.01 micrograms per milliliter. EXAMPLE 7Direct Isolation of the Ammonium Salt of Compound III The broth from a fermentation as in Example 20A 100 gal is acidified with H3PO4 to pH of 5. Ethyl acetate 70 gal is added and the mixture is stirred vigorously. It is then filtered from the mycelia residue and the cake is washed with a small amount of ethyl acetate which is combined with the main extract.The organic phase is separated and mixed with 5 gallons of 0.2N sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is stirred vigorously and then allowed to settle. The aqueous layer is separated and the pH is adjusted from 9 to 5 by addition of H3PO4. It is then extracted, first with 2 gallons of hexane ethyl acetate 2 1 mixture and then with one gallon of the same mixture. The separate organic extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The drying agent is then separated by filtration and the cake washed with one liter of the same hexane ethyl acetate solution, the rinse being combined with the filtrate. This filtrate solution, after further dilution with 2 L of acetone, is stirred while ammonia gas is passed in. The gas is absorbed and a crystalline precipitate appears.When ammonia is no longer absorbed, and a darkening in color is observed in the precipitate, the introduction of ammonia is terminated and the mixture is allowed to stand several hours after which it is filtered. The crude ammonium salt filter cake is washed with acetone to a colorless wash and is then air dried. The crude ammonium salt can be recrystallized by dissolving it in 1.5 gallons of a mixture of chloroform, methanol and concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide 80 20 2 and filtering the colored insoluble material. The filtrate solution is then diluted with an equal volume of acetone ether 1 1 combination and allowed to stand overnight.

Fermentation A tube of lyophilized culture MF 4845 is opened aseptically and the contents suspended in an unbaffled 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask seed flask containing approximately 10 ml of the Medium which has the following composition MediumCorn steep liquor 5 gTomato paste 40 gOatmeal 10 gGlucose 10 gTrace Element Solution 10 gDistilled water 1000 ml pH 6.8 with NaOH Trace Element Solution FeSO4O7H2O 1000 mg MnSO4.4H2O 1000 mg CuCl2 2H2O 25 mg CaC122H2O 100 mgH3BO3 56 mg N114 6Mo7O24 4H2O 19 mg ZnSO47H2O 200 mgDistilled Deionized Water 1000 m The inoculated flask is incubated for 24 hours at 280C on a 220 rpm shaker 2 inch throw .An unbaffled 2 literErlenmeyer flask containing 500 ml of the medium is then inoculated with 10 ml of the first stage fermentation growth from the seed mixture. This too was shaken 24 hours at 280C. A 200 gallon stainless steel fermentation vat was then charged with 485 liters of a medium comprising Cerelose 4.5 wt vol Peptonized Milk 2.5 wt vol Autolyzed yeast 0.25 wt vol Polyglycol P2000 0.25 vol vol whose pH was adjusted to 7.0. This was sterilized 15 minutes at 121eC. One liter of the second stage above was then charged and the mixture was incubated at 85 rpm for 12 hours then 130 rpm for 84 hours at 280C with an air flow of 5 cfm for 12 hours then 10 cfm for 84 hours.B. Isolation 1. Extraction Two batches of one hundred gallons of whole broth were combined, acidified with stirring to pH4.1 by careful addition of 800 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and extracted by addition of 75 gal of ethyl acetate and further stirring for two hours. About 25 lbs of a silicaceous filter aid was then added and the total slurry was pumped through a 24 inch filter press. An additional 75 gal of ethyl acetate was used to wash the press cake and continue the extraction, by reversing the direction of pumping through the press four times. Then all of the wash solvent was discharged from the press and combined with the first filtrate. The two phase filtrate was allowed to settle, and the water layer removed. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with 10 gal of deionized water, the phases were allowed to separate and the ethyl acetate extracts were concentrated under vacuum to a residue of about 10 gal. 2. Lactonization In order to cyclize any Compound IV in the extract to Compound II, the following azeotropic treatment was performed. Ethyl acetate extracts from an additional three hundred gal of broth were added to the above extract and the volume was reduced to about thirty gal by vacuum distillation. About fifty gal of toluene was added, and the batch was concentrated under vacuum to 32 gal this step was repeated then sufficient new toluene was added to bring the volume to 75 gal. Without vacuum, the batch was brought to reflux and maintained there for two hours, with a temperature over 106 C. This solution was then concentrated under vacuum to a small volume, which was further concentrated to an oily residue in a large rotary evaporator under vacuum. 3. Chromatography on Silica Gel The extract obtained above was flushed free of other solvents by addition of 2 gal of methylene chloride and reconcentration to an oil. The oily residue was dissolved in about 5 gal of ethyl acetate methylene chloride 30 70 v v mixture, and a slurry was made by addition of 2.8 kg of silica gel. The slurry was loaded as a level layer on the top of a 12 in. x 50 in. silica gel column packed in the same solvent mixture. Elution was with ethyl acetate methylene chloride 40 60 v v at 800 ml min. A forerun of 10 gal, then further fractions of 4 gal each were collected. Fractions 6 10 inclusive were concentrated under vacuum to an oily residue which was dissolved in hot ethyl acetate, treated with decolorizing carbon, filtered hot, and cooled. Crystals of MSD 803 Compound I were filtered off and the mother liquors were concentrated to an oil for further chromatography. 4. Rechromatography on Silica Gel Mother liquor residues from similar broth extract work ups equivalent to an additional 600 gal of fermentation production were combined with the above in methylene chloride solution. One half of this solution was taken for further silica gel chromatography. A small aliquot showed a total solids content of 325 g. The solution was treated with 40 g of decolorizing carbon, filtered, and the cake rinsed with methylene chloride.The combined filtrate and washings were concentrated under vacuum to an oily residue. This was redissolved in 800 ml of ethyl acetate methylene chloride 30 70 v v and slurried with 225 g of silica gel. The slurry was loaded on top of a 14 x 36 cm column bed of silica gel packed in the same solvent mixture. Development was with ethyl acetate methylene chloride 40 60 v v . A forecut of three liters was set aside then fractions of 800 ml each were collected. 5. Chromatography on Reverse phase Packing Forty ml from fraction 12 of the above chromatography were concentrated to an oil weighing 500 mg and the oil redissolved in 5 ml acetonitrile. This acetonitrib solution was charged to a 5 8 OD by 6 ft long stainless steel chromatography column packed with preparative reversephase liquid chromatography column packing material Bondapak C18 PorasilB Water Associates, Inc., Milford,Mass. 01757 . The column was eluted with a mixture consisting of v v 55 acetonitrile and 45 0.05 M ammonium phosphate pH3. The elution volume between 1360 ml and 1700 ml was combined on the basis of refractive index detection. The organic solvent was removed in vacuo and the residual aqueous solution extracted with ethyl acetate.In vacuo removal of the ethyl acetate left 120 mg of the title compound which crystallized from a concentrated acetonitrile solution yielding crystals MSD 883 CompoundII , m.p. 129 1310C. EXAMPLE 21Alternate Isolation of Compounds II and IV Crude ammonium salt, isolated as described in Example 7 from a 1100 gal fermentation, is lactonized by dissolving in water, acidifying to pH3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, extracting into toluene, and refluxing for two hours, as described in Example 20 B 2. Concentration under vaccum to a small volume affords crystals of crude Compound I mixed with a smaller amount of Compound II these are filtered off and dried. Material from twelve such batches is combined and recrystallized from 101 lbs of ethanol, filtered, and washed with ethanol. The combined mother liquors and washes are concentrated in vacuo to about 3 gal and a second crop of crystals of Compound I are filtered off. The mother liquors from this filtration are worked up as follows About 0.5 1 of these mother liquors are prepared for reverse phase chromatography by concentration under vacuum to remove ethanol, flushing with acetonitrile and filtration of trace insolubles. A solution in 100 ml of acetonitrile is passed over a 200 ml bed of C 18 reverse phase packing, and the bed washed with an additional liter of acetonitrile. The combined filtrates are concentrated and dissolved in a total of 360 ml of chromatographic solvent 60 acetonitrile 40 water v v and filtered to remove trace insolubles.Solids content by test aliquot is 15.3 g. A charge of 160 ml of this feed stock is chromatographed in a Waters Prep 500 system using two 5 x 30 cm cartridges of C 18 reverse phase packing Waters Assoc. bonded octa decyl coating on silica and acetonitrile water, 60 40 v v as the eluant at 130 ml min, at ambient temperature, with refractive index detection. Impurities eluted in the first 3900 ml of eluant are rejected. A large peak of Compound I is obtained from 3900 to 5850 ml of eluant and set aside. Mixed fractions are obtained from 5850 ml to 6500 ml of elution these are set aside for rechromatography. Purified Compound II is obtained as the last peak the fraction between 6500 and 8450 ml of elution is collected and concentrated to an oily residue of about 3 g. One half about 1.5 g of this concentrate of Compound II is prepared for chromatography as the ammonium salt of Compound IV by making a solution in 6 ml of warm methanol with agitation and adding immediately sufficient 1N sodium hydroxide to hold the pH at 10.5 11 3.5 3.8 ml of alkali are required. After standing for one half hour, the solution is filtered to remove a trace of insolubles, and the filtrate is pumped into a column, 1 x 34 of 200 325 mesh milled XAD 2 resin a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer and eluted with 23 acetonitrile 77 0.1N ammonium hydroxide at 2 ml min at 400C. Fractions of 20 ml are collected fractions 1 through 44 contain impurities, and a peak of Compound III salt, which is rejected.Fractions 45 61 are collected, concentrated under vacuum to a small aqueous residual volume and freeze dried to a residue of ammonium salt of Compound IV, wt. 0.72 g.

After one hour at room temperature, the mixture is taken to dryness in vacuo to yield the sodium salt of Compound IV. In like manner the potassium salt is prepared using one equivalent of potassium hydroxide and the calcium salt using one half equivalent of CaO. Employing the procedures substantially as described in Examples 9 12 and 14, but substituting for the ammonium salt of Compound III in each case an equivalent amount of the ammonium salt of Compound IV, there is produced respectively the L lysine, L arginine,L ornithine, N methylglucamine and calcium salts of compound IV. Employing the procedures substantially as described in Examples 13, 15 and 16, but substituting for Compound I in each case, an equivalent amount ofCompound II, there is produced respectively the ethylene diamine, tetramethylammonium and ammonium salts ofCompound IV. EXAMPLE 23Preparation of Hydroxy Acid, Compound IV The sodium salt produced in Example 22 is redissolved in 2 ml of ethanol water 1 1 and added to 10 ml of 0.1N hydrochloric acid from which the liberated hydroxy acid is extracted with ethyl acetate. The latter solvent is washed once with water, dried and removed in vacuo with a bath temperature not exceeding 300. The hydroxy acid derived slowly reverts to the lactone on standing. EXAMPLE 24Preparation of Hydroxy Acid, Compound IV 221 Mg of the ammonium salt of Compound IV, are dissolved in 4.5 ml of 65 ethanol.

In Vitro Inhibition of HMG Coenzyme A Reductase The method of Beg et al., FEBS Letters, 80, 123 1977 was modified slightly by incubating the enzyme with the inhibitor for five minutes before initiating the reaction with the substrate. With potent inhibitors such as the novel compounds of this invention, the standard procedure of merely adding enzyme to the inhibitor substrate mixture gave non linear kinetics. Using the modified procedure, the sodium salt of Compound IV gives an IC50 in inhibiting HMG CoAReductase of 2.7 x 10 M as compared with 5.4 x 10 9 for ML236B. B. In Vivo Inhibition of Cholesterol Synthesis Compound II Groups of male Holtzman rats were dosed with either 5 emulphor in saline or test compound in emulphor by stomach tube.

Chem. 249 5241 1974 measuring the quantity of 14C sterol biosynthesis from 14C acetic acid in mouse L M cells in culture was employed with modification. The test compound in 10 1 DMSO was added to the monolayer cultures with 5 WCi of 14C acetate. After a 3 hour 14 incubation, the cells were saponified and the C sterol extracted and isolated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether diethyl ether acetic acid 75 25 1 . The region on the plate containing 14C sterol was identified by staining with I2 and the 14C content determined by liquid scintillation counting. Using the modified procedure Compound II givesIC50 in inhibiting HMG CoA reductase of 17 nM as compared to 22 nM for Compound I and 46 nM for ML 236B.
