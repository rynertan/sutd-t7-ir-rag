## Description
The invention relates to a press and, in particular, a press incorporating separate, defined, selectable pressure stages. Known presses for forming articles from material generally comprise two opposed working surfaces, one of which reciprocally moves between positions spaced from and in pressing contact with the other surface. Pressure is generated between the working surface by a pressing force acting on the one surface being opposed by either a relatively rigid support for the other surface or a counter force acting on the other surface. Since presses in which the other surface is rigidly supported are relatively inefficient due to the work loss and require substantial strength to support the pressure involved without substantial press deflection, many modern presses incorporate a means for imposing a counter force on the other surface. This is particularly the case where the material being pressed is relatively soft or easy to shape. Presses for such material, such as paper, require a counter force which cooperates with the pressing force to gradually reach the desired pressure acting on the material. In many such presses the counter force is provided by compression springs, called bolster springs, which support the other surface. The bolster springs resist the pressing force and determine the pressure imposed between the working surfaces. Such presses are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,377,599 and 3,054,144. A press of this type commonly used for producing paperboard products is the Peerless Forming Machine sold by the Peerless Machine Tool Corporation. The known presses using bolster springs have certain disadvantages, particularly where they are used to form paperboard products. One disadvantage is the inability to control when maximum pressure is applied by the bolster springs. In most known presses for paperboard where the working surfaces are complementary dies, as the dies approach complete mating, the spring generated pressure rises rapidly, often imposing excessive forming pressure before the die mating action has had an opportunity to shape the article. If pressure is fully applied before the paperboard has achieved the required shape, subsequent shaping by the dies will tear the paperboard. Other disadvantages of spring operated presses include the load imposed by the springs on the press motor necessitating use of higher capacity motors. Moreover, where bolster springs are used, it is difficult and time consuming to change the forming pressure as product or process changes occur causing significant press down time. Most known presses provide several pairs of cooperating dies for production of several formed articles for each press cycle. In such presses, each die pair has its own set of bolster springs providing forming pressure. In these multiple across configurations, forming pressure may vary between die pairs anywhere from 30 to 85 . Such variation produces articles of varying rigidity and quality. A variety of factors contribute to the undesirable product variation including different spring rates, spring lengths, die setups, and press deflections. A further prior art press is illustrated in EP A 0 091 754 upon which is based the prior art portions of claims 1 and 16. This prior press replaces the more usual bolster springs at discussed above with what is, in fact, a pneumatic bolster spring in that the lower die is simply pressed downwardly against a pneumatic pressure responsive to downward movement of the upper die in engagement therewith. The invention overcomes the abovementioned and other disadvantages of the prior presses. The press of the invention as defined in claim 1 incorporates, and the method of the invention as defined in claim 17 utilises, a forming system having means for controlling and changing the pressure between the working surfaces during a press cycle. In particular, the invention includes a system permitting selection of two or more counter forces which are applied to the other surface at predetermined times during a press cycle. For example, in a press for forming paperboard articles, the invention provides a dual pressure counter force, a first pressure for shaping the article and a second greater pressure for forming the article. The dual pressure aspect of the invention provides two advantages. First, since only lower pressure is applied until the dies are fully mated and, therefore, the article has been fully shaped, the tearing of the article which occurs in prior presses is eliminated. Second, the dual pressure eliminates motor overload because high pressure is applied only after the dies are fully mated. When the motor drives a cam, high pressure is applied only during cam dwell and torque transmitted back to the motor is zero. As each die pair is biased together by a hydraulic cylinder receiving pressurised fluid from a common source, all die pairs in a multiple across die configuration are subjected to the same pressures resulting in consistently uniform product. Moreover, required changes in shaping or forming pressure may be effected with ease by merely adjusting the common hydraulic source pressure. Additional advantages of the invention are set forth in part in the description which follows. The invention is a press comprising a pair of opposed working surfaces, means for cyclically moving one surface between positions spaced from and in pressing contact with the other surface, means for limiting the movement of the other surface, means for biasing the other surface toward the one surface under a predetermined force, and means for cyclically changing the magnitude of the predetermined force between controlled, predetermined levels during each cycle of the moving means.

It is also preferred that the press includes compensating means that comprise a stroke length for each hydraulic cylinder greater than that necessary to bias the respective second surface against its upper limit.

FIGURE 3 is a hydraulic schematic showing an embodiment of the hydraulic power system component of the invention. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view similar to that of Figure 1 of another embodiment of the invention. Figure 5 is a hydraulic schematic showing another embodiment of the hydraulic power system component of the invention. Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In accordance with the invention, a press comprises a pair of opposed working surfaces and means for cyclically moving one surface between positions spaced from and in pressing contact with the other surface. In the embodiment depicted in the drawings, Figures 1 and 4, wherein like components have the same numbers, the press 10 comprises a pair of opposed working surfaces 11 and 13, which in the depicted preferred embodiment are complementary dies 14, 16. In the embodiment, the moving means comprises ram 18 carrying one working surface 11 and operatively engaged by rotating cam 20 for cyclically moving surface 11 between positions spaced from and in pressing contact with surface 13. As embodied and depicted in Figures 1 and 2, the press 10 includes frame 12 and first die 14 complementary with second die 16. While first die 14 is depicted as the male die and second die 16 the female die, they may be reversed depending upon product requirements. In the embodiment, the cam means comprises ram 18 supported by frame 12 for axial movement. Ram 18 carries first die 14 and is reciprocally moved along its axis by the action of cam 20. Rotation of cam 20 axially moves ram 18 and first die 14 between a first position where first die 14 is axially spaced from second die 16 and a second position where first die 14 and second die 16 are fully mated. Cam 20 includes a portion 22 thereof which defines a dwell period when first die 14 is in its second position fully mated with second die 16. In the embodiment depicted in Figures 1 and 2, the bolster means comprises bolster plate 30 supporting second die 16 on one surface thereof and a plurality of pressure pins 32 secured to and axially depending from the other surface of bolster plate 30. Preferably, bolster plate 30 is supported within housing 34 for axial movement, housing 34 being supported by frame 12. Housing 34 includes shoulders 36 defining the lower limit for axial movement of bolster plate 30 and plate locators 38 defining the upper limit of axial movement of bolster plate 30. Housing 34 may include axial bores for guiding axial movement of pressure pins 32. In the preferred embodiment, housing 34 fixedly supports pin guide 40 including axial bores 42 for guidably receiving pressure pins 32. As embodied herein, the power means comprises a hydraulic cylinder 44 including a cylinder rod 46 which is responsive to hydraulic pressures. Hydraulic cylinder 44 is fixed to and supported by beam 48 which is fixed to frame 12. Beam 48 includes a bore 50 for slidably receiving cylinder rod 46. As depicted in Figure 1, the transmitting means comprises yoke 52 attached at one side thereof to the projecting end of cylinder rod 46 for axial movement with cylinder rod 46. Yoke 52 engages at the other side thereof, pressure pins 42. The compensating means comprises a spherical rod end 54 on the end of cylinder rod 46 engaging the one side of yoke 52 providing limited relative displacement between yoke 52 and cylinder rod 46 in the plane of Figure 1. The compensating means further comprises a clevis bracket 56 and pivot pin 58 for pivotally attaching the end of cylinder rod 46 to the one side of yoke 52 and for providing for limited relative movement between cylinder rod 46 and yoke 52 in a plane normal to Figure 1. In addition, the compensating means includes a plurality of inserts 60 disposed on the other side of yoke 52, each insert having a concave depression 62 cooperating with a complementary convex end of a respective one of the pressure pins 32. The cooperating concave depressions and convex pressure pin ends provide for limited misalignment between yoke 52 and pressure pins 32. Preferably bolster plate 30 is generally rectangular and includes four spaced pressure pins, one secured to the other surface of bolster plate 30 proximate each corner thereof. In the preferred embodiment, one pressure pin 33 is intentionally shorter than the other three pressure pins 32, and is disposed to engage an axially adjustable insert 61. Use of the axially adjustable insert 61 permits adjustment to ensure relative parallel relation between yoke 52 and bolster plate 30 for even application of pressure to bolster plate 30 through pressure pins 32, 33. The biasing means may comprise a low pressure power means for normally biasing the other surface toward the one surface under a force at least sufficient to overcome gravity acting on the other surface and its support structure, and a high pressure power means responsive to the position of the one surface for applying a predetermined force on the other surface in opposition to the pressing force acting on the one surface. The low pressure power means may be hydraulic, pneumatic or a spring force, and need only be controlled within certain limits since the low pressure is insignificant compared to the high pressure. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 4, the biasing means comprises a hydraulic cylinder operatively engaging the other surface and means responsive to air pressure for normally biasing the other surface toward the one surface at a first pressure. In addition to hydraulic cylinder 44, the biasing means includes pneumatic pressure devices 45 disposed between beam 48 and yoke 52. Preferably, devices 45 are in communication with control unit 47 receiving air under pressure from pump 49. The control unit 47 includes known means for adjusting the level of air pressure from pump 49 to the desired first pressure under which devices 45 will normally bias yoke 52 and other surface 13 toward the one surface 11. Preferably, the first pressure generated by devices 45 is less than the pressing force imposed on other surface 13 by the ram 18 and cam 20. In accordance with the invention, the press includes means for cyclically changing the magnitude of the predetermined force between controlled predetermined levels during each cycle of the moving means. In the preferred embodiment, the power means includes the changing means which comprises control means responsive to the position of the cam means for normally conveying hydraulic fluid at the first pressure to the hydraulic cylinder and for conveying hydraulic fluid at the second pressure to the hydraulic cylinders during the dwell period. Referring to Figure 3, the control means comprises hydraulic pump 70 driven by motor 72 for pumping hydraulic fluid from reservoir 74 to provide a source of high pressure hydraulic fluid. The pressurized hydraulic fluid passes through check valve 76 and charges accumulator 78 to the high pressure setting of unloading valve 82. Once the pressure in accumulator 78 achieves the preselected high pressure, accumulator 78 provides system pressure until the accumulator pressure decreases by 25 of its initial pressure at which point fluid flow from pump 70 is directed through valve 76 to repressurize accumulator 78. The control means includes an electrically operated directional valve means for selectively conveying first a second pressure to the hydraulic cylinder. As depicted in Figure 3, the valve means is solenoid operated directional valve 84 which functions to shift between the lower first pressure and the higher second pressure. Where valve 84 is energized, it conveys system pressure to reducing valve 85 which is selectively set to limit pressure conveyed to the hydraulic cylinders 44 to the selected second pressure. The pressure reducing valve 85 may be adjusted in order to easily change the level of second pressure conveyed to cylinders 44. When directional valve 84 is deenergized, it shifts to the low pressure mode by which hydraulic fluid is conducted to low pressure relief valve 86 and low pressure accumulator 88. Relief valve 86 is selectively set to a predetermined pressure determined to be low enough as to avoid overloading the drive mechanism of the press, but high enough to bias bolster plate 30 against its axial upper limit defined by locators 38. The low pressure fluid is stored in accumulator 88 which provides low pressure through directional valve 84 to hydraulic cylinders 44. As pressure reducing valve 85 defines the higher second pressure, the lower first pressure generated by accumulator 88 is not affected by valve 85. In the embodiment, the control means also comprises means for sensing the position of the cam means and for operating the directional valve 84 to convey second pressure to cylinder 44 when the cam means is in the dwell period. As diagramatically depicted in Figure 2, a known sensor 90 is used to sense the position of the shaft driving cams 20 and to generate an electrical signal when cams 20 are in the dwell period. This signal is conveyed along electrical conduit 92 to directional valve 84. Thus, when cam 20 is in the dwell period, an electrical signal is sent to directional valve 84 energizing the valve to shift to convey high system pressure through reducing valve 85 which sets the second pressure for acting on cylinders 44 during the dwell period. Sensor 90 is preferably arranged to deenergize directional valve 84 slightly before the end of the dwell period thereby allowing the control system to shift to the lower first pressure as the cam rotates out of the dwell period. This eliminates the resistance torque component which would cause an overload to the drive system of the press. As depicted in Figure 3, the hydraulic system further includes a solenoid operated dump valve 94 used to expel all hydraulic fluid from the accumulators when pump 70 stops. This is a safety feature to prevent high pressure fluid from remaining in the system when it is shut down. In order to protect the machine from failure of pressure reducing valve 85, relief valve 200 is provided in the cylinder line circuit. Valve 200 is selectively set slightly above working pressure but below the pressure at which damage to the press would occur. The system also includes a filter 96 in return line 98 and an air cooled heat exchanger 100 in pilot drain line 102. Gauge 104 provides a reading of low cylinder or first pressure, gauge 106 provides a reading of high cylinder or second pressure, gauge 108 provides a reading of pump pressure, and gauge 110 indicates the pressure of accumulator 78. In the second embodiment as depicted in Figure 4, the changing means comprises a control means 83 in communication with a hydraulic fluid pump 85 for conveying hyraulic fluid to cylinder 44 at a second pressure. Control means 83 is responsive to a sensor 91 indicating the position of the one surface 11 such that the second pressure hydraulic fluid is only communicated to cylinder 44 when working surfaces 11, 13 are in pressing contact. Control means 83 includes means 87 for adjusting the second pressure to a predetermined desired level. In operation, in the preferred embodiment, depicted in Figure 1, the other surface 13 constituting second die 16 is normally biased by hydraulic pressure admitted to cylinder 44 under a first pressure. The first pressure is communicated through yoke 52 and pressure pins 32, 33 to press bolster plate 30 against the upper stops 38. A piece of sheet material 112 is disposed between the working surfaces 11, 13 and rotation of cam 20 moves the one surface 11 constituting first die 14 axially toward second die 16. The first pressure is constant and maintained on bolster plate 30 until dies 14 and 16 are fully mated. The cam mechanism imposes a pressing force between dies 14 and 16 which biases bolster plate 30 axially away from upper limit or stops 38. The first force or pressure from cylinder 44 is less than the pressing force generated by cam 20. When dies 14, 16 are fully mated, cam 20 enters the dwell period defined by surface 22. This is communicated to the hydraulic circuit depicted in Figure 3 which shifts to send the higher second pressure to cylinder 44. Since bolster plate 30 has been axially displaced from the upper limit defined by stops 38, the second pressure acts directly between dies 14, 16 in axial opposition to the pressing force from cam 20. Where a paper container is being formed from the blank 112, the lower first pressure biasing bolster 30 against upper limit 38 is merely sufficient to keep dies 14 and 16 in proximity such that axial movement of die 14 into mating relationship with die 16 will shape the desired container from blank 112 without applying undue pressure. After blank 112 has been fully shaped and dies 14, 16 are fully mated, then the greater second pressure is applied to form or press the shaped blank into the desired product. The invention further contemplates a press incorporating a plurality of pairs of first and second complementary dies as depicted in Figure 2. In this embodiment of the invention, the ram means 18 is supported by frame 12 for axial movement and carries a plurality of first dies 14 for movement together. Cams 20 are driven by shaft 21 and are rotatably supported within frame 12 for reciprocally moving ram 18 between a first position where the pairs of first and second dies are spaced and a second position where the pairs of first and second dies are mated. The cam means includes the dwell period when the ram means is in the second position. Each second die is supported by an independent bolster which in turn is supported within frame 12 by housing 34 for independent axial movement between upper and lower limits. Each second die 16 and bolster 30 has its own hydraulic power means as described above with respect to the embodiment depicted in Figure 1 which is responsive to the cam means for normally biasing the bolster toward its upper limit under a predetermined first hydraulic pressure and for biasing each bolster towards its upper limit under a predetermined second hydraulic pressure during the dwell period. The second hydraulic pressure is greater than the first pressure. As seen in Figure 3, the plurality of cylinders 44 may be arranged in series on a hydrualic line from the control system, although other means of connecting the cylinders to the control system are possible. In another embodiment, generally depicted in Figure 5, the invention contemplates a multiple across press arrangement wherein certain of the pairs of opposed working surfaces or dies 44A perform one desired pressing function and other dies 44B in the same press perform another desired pressing function. Since these different pressing functions require different pressure requirements, separate control circuits are provided for controlling the second pressures constituting the counter force acting on the second surface. Any number of means for conveying different pressures to different pairs of dies in the same press may be possible. One possibility is depicted in Figure 5 wherein the hydraulic system of Figure 3 is modified by adding a second pressure reducing valve 85B and associated relief valve 200B and gauge 106B to provide a separate high pressure control for dies 44B. The use of multiple dies for simultaneously manufacturing different products provides the ability to more efficiently use blanks disposed within the press, particularly where the blanks are web blanks rather than individual blanks. For example, large paper plates may be manufactured in the press and the unpressed portion of the web between each plate may be used to manufacture small bowls. This substantially reduces waste. The invention further includes means for compensating for press deflection. When the opposed surfaces are in pressing contact, the press force is in direct opposition to the counter force at a higher second pressure. Unless the press is uneconomically made substantially stronger than most normal presses, these opposed forces will cause a certain degree of press deflection. In multiple across arrangements, such press deflection varies from one pair of working surfaces to the next depending on their proximity to supporting structural members such as the sidewalls of the frame. In prior art presses, it is virtually impossible to measure and compensate for press deflection because of the varying spring constants and the difficulty in using insensitive bolster springs which are not infinitely adjustable to compensate for different minor press deflections. Where the press deflections are not compensated for, the pressure imposed between the cooperating surfaces varies resulting in products of varying quality. Accordingly, the invention provides a means for insuring that the pressure between the opposed surfaces is constant throughout the press despite varying press deflections. This is achieved by providing hydraulic cylinders 44 having a stroke length which is greater than that necessary to abut the bolster plates 30 against their upper limits 38. For example, the high pressure used in forming paperboard containers may cause total deflections in load bearing members of between .032 to .093 inches 0.8 to 2.3 mm depending on the pressure used. To compensate for this deflection, the hydraulic cylinders have a work stroke of one inch and are located such that when bolster plates 30 abut locators 38, the cylinders are operating at mid stroke. This provides a 0.5 inch 12.7 mm compensation for deflection and wear of machine members. The invention further contemplates a method of forming a shaped article from sheet material comprising the steps of providing a first die 14 for reciprocal axial movement between first and second positions and providing a second die 16 complementary and axially opposed to the first die for axial movement between upper and lower limits. The method includes applying a first predetermined hydrualic pressure to the second die 16 to bias second die 16 toward the upper limit defined by locator 38 on housing 34 which engage bolster 30. Under the method, sheet material 112 is disposed between the first and second dies 14, 16. First die 14 is axially moved from a first position spaced from the second die 16 to a second position mated with second die 16 by the force of cam 20. The force of cam 20 is sufficient to axially move second die 16 and its supporting bolster plate 30 from the upper axial limit defined by locators 38 when first die 14 achieves its fully mated second position. The surface 22 of cam 20 defines a dwell period maintaining first die in the second position for a predetermined period. The control system depicted in Figure 3 senses that cam 20 is in the dwell period and applies the second predetermined hydrualic pressure through hydraulic cylinder 44 to bolster plate 30 and second die 16 to bias second die 16 toward its upper limit. The second pressure is greater than the first pressure. As axial movement of first die 14 in its second position is limited mechanically by the position of cam 20 acting on ram 18 and bolster plate 30 is axially spaced from locators 38, the second pressure imposed during the dwell period acts on sheet material 112 which has been shaped by the initial movement of first die 14 to its second position. The higher second pressure serves to form an article as defined by the complementary shapes of dies 14, 16. As the higher pressure is imposed between dies 14, 16 during the dwell period of cam 20, the higher pressure does not overload the drive system. The method further includes axially moving first die from the second position to the first position by movement of cam 20 out of the dwell period and removing the second higher hydrualic pressure from and applying the first hydraulic pressure to the second die. Preferably, the shift from the second pressure to the lower first pressure is effected just before cam 20 moves out of the dwell period. The final step in the method of the invention is removing the shaped article from the press.
