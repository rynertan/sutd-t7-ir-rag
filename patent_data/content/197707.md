## Description
ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT BREAKERTechnical Field This invention relates generallv to circus. breakers, and more particularly to circuit breakers that are useful in power control circuits.Background Art Electronic devices require power to operate. In certain instances, it becomes desirable to control the application of power as supplied to a specific device, such as a relay. In order to effectuate such control, an in line switch comprising a transistor has often been utilized. By appropriately controlling the biasing of this transistor, the controlled device can be selectively connected to and disconnected from a power source. If a load short occurs during times when the controlled device connects through such a transistor to a power source, current draw through the transistor can increase and damage the circuit. In an atten pt to resolve this situation, at least three prior are solutions have been proposed. The simplest solution provides or a sensing mechanism to determine when current flow through the transistor equals or exceeds some preselectea threshold, thereby providing an indicia of a load short condition.Upon sensing such d condition, this prior are solution provides that the transistor be biased off. Following this, no recovery of the system can occur in an automatic fashion. Rather, operator interaction must be resorted to. When the sensed load short condition only represents a transient condition, this inability to respond with an automatic recovery represents an unciesirable characteristic of this solution. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, a second prior art solution provides for a sense resistor A connected in series with the switch transistor B . A comparator C of appropriate design connects across the sense resistor A and drives the base of the transistor B in response thereto. So configured, the comparator C operates to regulate the voltage across the sense resistor A by controlling base current to the transistor B . In short, this prior art solution seeks to limit current flow through the transistor B under a load short condition. This latter solution has the benefit of recovering automatically when a load short condition proves to be transient. Unfortunately, this soLution also ensures that a non negligible quantity of heat will be generated by the transistor B under load shore conciitions. Therefore, this solution requires that a significant amount of heat sink capability be provided. Further, it will be appreciated that this system does not constitute an energy efficient solution, since power will be consumed during non transient load shorts. The third prior art solution can also be described with reference to Fig. 1. Unlike the second prior art solution described above, however, this solution contemplates that the comparator C have at least two internal thresholds that may be switched depending upon the amplitude of che incoming signals. Therefore, if the voltage across the sense resistor becomes too high an indicia of a load short condition , the comparator can switch to a lower internal threshold. This then aids in limiting the current flow through the transistor B . Furthermore, upon removal of the load short condition, the comparator can automatically revert back to the original threshold and continue to operate in an ordinary manner. As with the second solution, this third solution has the benefit of automatically recovering in response to the removal of a load short condition. Unfortunately, although the heat problem with this solution is less than that experienced with the second solution noted above, a substantial heat sink must still be provided to effectuate this system, and power can still be wasted. There therefore exists a need for an electronic circuit breaker that will protect a circuit from excessive current draw, generate little or no heat during the presence of a load short, and that can further recover normal operation once the load short condition has been resolved without requiring intervention of the operator.Summarv of Invention The above needs are substantially met by provision of the electronic circuit breaker described in this specification. This electronic circuit breaker can be used with a system having a power input, a power output, and a switch positioned therebetween that can respond to a control signal for opening and closing a conductive path between the power input and the power output. The electronic circuit breaker includes a sense unit for sensing an excessive draw of current from the power input and for providing a fault signal when sensing such an excessive draw of current. The aevice further includes an inhibit unit that responds to the fault signal and inhibits the switch in the presence of such a signal to thereby cause the conductive path to be open. In one embodiment of this invention, the switch can be realized through use of a transistor having its power terminals connected to the power input and the power output, respectively. The base of the transistor operably connects as appropriate to receive a control signal such that its switching state can be selectively determined. The sense unit can be realized through use of a sense resistor placed in series with the power terminals of the transistor, and by use of a secona switch, such as a transistor, that can respond to an increase in voltage across the resistor in order to produce a fault signal when current through the resistor exceeds a predetermined threshold. The inhibit unit includes two inputs. One input receives the control signal and the remaining input receives the fault signal as generated by the sense unit.The inhibit unit further includes a flip flop and an output stage. The control input provides the control signal to both the flip flop and the output stage. The fault signal connects only to the reset port or the flip flop. So configured, the electronic circuit breaker operates to transmit unaltered on and off control signals to the transistor switch, presuming the absence of a fault signal. With a fault signal present, however, the inhibit unit will operate to inhibit the transmission of any on signals to the switch transistor. More particularly, when current through the sense resistor exceeds some predetermined threshold, the sense unit transistor will switch on and cause an output fault signal to be applied at the reset port of the flip flop in the inhibit unit. Then, regardless of whether che control signal input carries a high or low signal, rhe output control signal from the output stage will be drawn low. This, in turn, causes the switch transistor to be switched orr. Following this, current through the sense resistor will drop to zero, and the transistor associated therewith will switch off, thereby removing the fault signal from the reset port of the flip flop. Therefore, the next on control signal that appears at the control input port of the inhibit unit will cause the switch transistor to switch on as usual. If the load short condition still exists, then the above described circuit breaker operation will again repeat. Otherwise, in the absence of a load short condition, the switch transistor will continue to operate in an ordinary fashion and the electronic circuit breaker will neither enhance nor inhibit this function. This electronic circuit breaker optimally combines minimal heat generation and energy loss with a self enabling recovery feature, thereby gaining all of the benefits of prior art mechanisms without incurring the disadvantages associated therewith.Brief Description of the Drawings These and other attributes of the invention will become more clear upon making a thorough review and study of the following description of the best mode for carrying out the invention, particularly when reviewed in conjunction with the drawings, wherein Fig. 1 comprises a schematic diagram of a prior art solution Fig. 2 comprises a block diagram of an electronic circuit breaker as constructed in accordance with the invention Fig. 3 comprises a schematic diagram of the invention Fig. 4 comprises a schematic diagram of an illustrative load Fig. 5a comprises a schematic diagram of the inhibit unit for purposes of logic analysis Fig. 5b comprises a logic truth table for the configuration set forth in Fig. 5a and Fig. 6 comprises a waveform diagram of an illustrative control signal input.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Referring now to the drawings, and in particular toFig. 2, the electronic circuit breaker can be seen as generally depicted in block diagram form by the numeral 10. The device 10 includes generally a switch unit 11 , a sense unit 12 , and an inhibit unit 13 . These generally referred to components will now be described in more detail in seriatim fashion. Referring now to Fig. 3, the switch unit 11 includes a first transistor 14 having its emitter operably connected through the sense unit 12 to a source of power 16 , its collector connected to a power output port 17 , and its base connected through a 1.8k ohm 1 2 watt resistor 18 to the collector of a second transistor 19 . The first transistor may be provided through use of a TIP706 transistor. The secona transistor 19 as may be provided through use of an tM BTA06 as manufactured by Motorola, Inc. has its emitter connected to ground and its base connected through a Ik ohm resistor 21 to the output port of the inhibit unit 13 as aescribed in more detail below. So configured, a switch control signal as supplied to the base of the second transistor 19 will in turn switch on the first transistor 14 such that power may be supplied from the power source 16 to a load through the power output port 17 . With reference to Fig. 4, such a load may be, for example, a relay 22 . Referring again to Fig. 3, the sense unit 12 includes a .1 ohm 1.5 watt resistor 23 connected in series between the emitter of the first transistor 14 in the switch unit 11 and the power source 16 . In addition, a lk ohm resistor 24 connects the low side of the sense resistor 23 to the base of a third transistor 26 as may be provided through use of a Motorola tBTA56. The base of this transistor 26 also connects through a .0047 microfarad capacitor 27 to the power source 16 . The emitter of this transistor 26 connects to the power source 16 and the collector connects through a 1k ohm resistor 28 to the anode of aMotorola BAV70 diode 29 , the cathode of which connects to a voltage supply 31 such as a 5 volt regulated source.The collector resistor 28 noted above also connects to the reset input port of the inhibit unit 13 as described below in more detail. So configured, the sense unit 12 operates to switch on the third transistor 26 when current through the sense resistor 23 exceeds a threshold predetermined by the values of the components described above. When switched on, the third transistor 26 provides a fault signal output to the inhibit unit 13 . The inhibit unit 13 will now be described with reference to Fig. 5a. The inhibit unit 13 has been constructed about three two input NOR gates 33, 34 and 36 . The first two NOR gates 33 and 34 comprise a flip flop and the third NOR gate 36 comprises an output stage. One input of the first NOR gate 33 connects to the output of the second NOR gate 34 , and similarly, one input of the second NOR gate 34 connects to the output of the first NOR gate 33 . The remaining input of the first NOR gate 33 comprises a set input and operably connects to receive the control signals as intendea for application to che switch unit 11 . The remaining input to the second flip flop 34 comprises a reset input and connects to receive the fault signal as provided by the sense unit 12 . The third NOR gate 36 , comprising the output stage, has one input connected to receive the Q output of the flip flop and its remaining input connected to directly receive the control signal. With reference to Fig. 5b, it may be seen that an output signal can only be realized from the output stageNOR gate 36 by providing a low signal at both the set and reset input ports. If a logic high signal appears at either or both of the set or reset ports, then no output will be provided from the output stage. More particularly, it will be appreciated that so long as no fault signal appears at the reset port, then the output signal from the output stage will be the inverse of the control signal logic status. In the alternative, when a fault signal does appear at the reset port, then the output of the output stage will be inhibited regardless of the logic status of the control signal. To take advantage of this particular configuration, a control signal may be utilized having a configuration such as that depicted in Fig. 6. It may be seen that this control signal provides an on signal by the presence of a logic low signal, whereas an off signal may be accommodated by transmission of a logic high signal. By use of such a control signal, an appropriate biasing signal will be transmitted by the inhibit unit 13 to the switch unit 11 by providing a logic low as the control signal presuming that no fault signal is present . Similarly, an off signal can be supplied to the switch unit 11 by providing a logic high signal as the control signal. By use of this electronic circuit breaker, the switch unit 11 will be turned off when a load short condition exists. By the same token, once the switch unit 11 has been switched off, the sense unit 12 will terminate transmission of a fault signal, ana thereby re ecable the inhibit unit 13 to transmit an on signal in conjunction with the control signal instructions. If the output fault condition has been remedied, then the switch unit 11 will have already recovered and will operate in its ordinary manner. If, however, the output fault condition persists, then the excessive draw of current will again be sensed by the sense unit 12 , and the inhibit unit 13 will again be triggered to again inhibit the continued operation of the switch unit 14 . Therefore, heat generation and energy dissipation can be minimized through use of this circuit. Further, the circuit provides for a self recovery mechanism that avoids the need for operator intervention. Those skilled in the art will recognize various modifications and alterations that could be effectuated with respect to the described circuit that would not depart from the spirit of the invention. Therefore, the scope of the invention should not be viewed as being limited to the embodiment described, except as such limitations may be present in the claims themselves.
