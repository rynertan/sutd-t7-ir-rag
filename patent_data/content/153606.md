# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLYURETHANE UREA ELASTOMERS

## Abstract
This invention pertains to the manufacture of polyurethane urea elastomers formed by reacting a pre polymer of an organic polyisocyanate and a compound having at least two Zerewitenoff active hydrogen atoms with a chain extender comprising t butylbenzenediamine. The utilization of t butylbenzenediamine as an aromatic diamine chain extender imparts flexibility in the handling of reactable compositions due to an increase in pot life and imparts excellent tensile modulus to the resulting polymer.
