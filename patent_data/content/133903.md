# Display control method and display control apparatus.

## Abstract
In the image displaying field where there is a tendency which will increase the data to be handled in accordance with the high integration of a display device, a CRT control ler 31 according to the present invention contemplates to improve the superposed display and the responsiveness of the display and drawing operations by dividing a unit clock into a predetermined number with a view to cope with the high speed and multifunction of the display. More specifically, when image data are to be inputted to or outputted from a refresh memory 33 corresponding to a display frame, the memory content and the display address are assigned at a ratio of 1 n to effect the proces sings in parallel. As a result, the time period consumed by the display cycle of the prior art can be assigned to the drawing opera tion so that the processings can be speeded up while making it easier than the prior art to effect the superposed display of letters, symbols and drawings. The resultant effect is that it is unnecessary to increase the number of the refresh memory 33 corresponding to the displayed frame and that the external parts can be sim plified to contribute to the improvement in the reliability.
