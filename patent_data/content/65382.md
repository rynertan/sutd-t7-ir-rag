Preferably, a sludge removal tank 30 is dis posed adjacent the water holding tank 18 of the coating booth 10 and communicated therewith through an inlet open ing 32 . Water jets 13 in the holding tank are directed at the inlet opening 32 creating a current which carries floating sludge to the removal tank. Preferably. air is entrained into wa ter and aids in floating particles. The bottoms 21, 23 of the tanks 18, 30 are preferably swept by water to remove parti cles settling to the bottom of the tanks. A reciprocating skim er 15 pushes floating sludge from the sludge removal tank 30 up an inclined beach and into a collection bin.
