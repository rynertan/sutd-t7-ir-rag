## Description
CONTROL APPARATUS INCORPORATING AN ELECTRONIC THERMOSTAT With the advent of microelectronic thermostats having memories that need continuous energization to maintain the information stored therein, many schemes have been devised to maintain the energization of the memory should the power source be interrupted or should some control apparatus have a switching operation which interrupts the power to the thermostat. One scheme is to introduce in the thermostat circuit an electrical storage circuit making use of a capacitor to store a voltage that would be maintained upon the loss of a power source to the thermostat for a short period of time to keep the memory energized. Another scheme obviously would be to add a battery to the thermostat so that, upon the loss of the external power source, the battery would maintain the energization of the memory. According to the invention, there is provided a control apparatus incorporating an electronic condition responsive means, the apparatus comprising a source of power connected to the apparatus and said means, and characterized in that a high impedence is provided to connect the source of power to the said means to maintain power to said means regardless of the operation of the control apparatus. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a typical furnace with a stack damper control apparatus according to the present invention Figure 2 shows in more detail one embodiment of the furnace stack damper control apparatus of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a preferred embodiment of the furnace stack damper control apparatus of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, a fuel burning temperature conditioning apparatus, boiler or furnace 10 supplies a medium for heating to a radiator or heat exchanger 11 in a space 12 in which the temperature is being controlled in response to a condition or temperature responsive switch or thermostat 13 such as a T8100A Microelectronic Chronotherm FuelSaver Thermostat and or T8200A Microelectronic ChronothermFuel Saver Thermostat manufactured and sold by HoneywellInc. The furnace has a gas valve 14 connected to a fuel source 15 not shown , to supply fuel for combusion to furnace 10. The products of combustion exhaust from the furnace through an exhaust stack or flue 20 into a chimney 21. Located in the exhaust stack 20 is a stack damper 22 which is controlled by a stack damper control unit 23 connected by circuit 24 to thermostat 13 and by circuit 25 to a transformer or source of power 30 and to gas valve 14. Referring to Figure 2, the furnace stack damper control unit 23 has a conventional electric motor 29 which is driven in one direction as indicated by the arrow to close the damper by an energization current at terminals 31 and 32.Motor 29 is a spring return motor which is driven in the opposite direction by a spring 33 for driving the damper open. One particular motor is sold by Honeywell Inc. as the M436A Damper Motor. Movement of motor 29 also drives the movable contact of a switch 34 having normally open circuit contact 35 and normally closed circuit contact 40 of a conventional switch such as a V 3 series switch made by Honeywell Inc. A conventional relay 1K has an energization winding 41 and normally closed contacts 1K1 and two normally open sets of contacts 1K2 and 1K3. When the stack damper control unit 23 is connected to the space thermostat 13 such as the mentioned T8100A andT8200A Thermostats and the gas valve 14 such as a V800Combination Gas Control, also sold by Honeywell Inc., and powered by the output of the transformer 30, the circuit can be traced to provide the following operation. When thermostat 13 is closed, relay 1K is energized by source of power 30 by energization winding 41 through normally closed contact 40. The energization of relay 1K opens the contacts 1K1 to de energize damper motor 29 which is normally energized to the closed position by the circuit from the power source through contacts 1K1, and which causes the damper 15 to move to an open position under the power of return spring 33.At the same time, the movable contact of switch 34 moves with the damper motor to open the normally closed contact 40 and close the normally open contact 35 to bring about energization of gas valve 14 from source of power 30 through the thermostat 13, the end switch contact 35, and back to the source of power through the 1K2 contacts now closed by energization of the relay 1K. Referring to the preferred embodiment of Figure 3, furnace stack damper control unit 23 has a conventional electric motor 29 , similar to motor 29, with an energization circuit between terminals 31 and 32 and an output shaft 36 adapted to be connected to a stack damper 22 as shown inFigure 1. Relay 1K has an energization winding 41 and normally closed contacts,1K2 and two normally open contacts 1K1 and 1K3 operated thereby. Motor 29 is a spring return motor having a return spring 33 connected to return output shaft 36 to a damper open position when the motor is deenergized. Movement of motor 29 drives the movable contact of a switch 34 between a normally open contact 35 and a normally closed contact 40 . Switch 34 operates near the last 100 of operation output shaft 36. When the stack damper control unit 23 is connected as shown in Figure 3 to gas valve 14, space thermostat 13 and source of power 30 at the connection terminals I, II,III, IV and V, the following operation takes place. Upon a call for heat by space thermostat 13, relay 1K is energized by connecting source of power transformer 30 to the energization winding 41 in the following manner. From one side of the transformer 30 to terminal II, energization winding 41 , to IV, thermostat 13, terminal III, normally closed contact 40 of the switch 34, and back to the transformer through terminal V. Upon the energization of relay 1K, relay contacts 1K2 open and the normally energized motor 29 which is energized to maintain damper 22 closed is de energized and the damper motor returns under the power of the spring return 33 to a damper open position.At the same time, the movable contact of switch 34 is moved to close normally open contact 35 and open the normally closed contact 40 . Gas valve 14 is energized through the circuit from the transformer through gas valve 14, terminalI, the now closed relay contact 1K3, the now closed contact 35 , the now closed relay contact 1K1, terminal V, and back to the source of power 30. Using contact 1K1 for the energization of valve 14 allows for only the relay energization current through winding 41 as the thermostat load. When thermostat 13 is satisfied and relay 1K is deenergized, switch 1K2 closes to energize motor 29. Motor 29 has a loss motion mechanism as shown in the Thomas J.Butzen US Patent 4,262,652, issued April 2 81, and does not operate the switch 34 for a period of time, possibly one minute, before engaging the switch operator to close contact 40 and open contact 35 . During this one minute period, power source 30 is not connected to thermostat 13. A resistor 50 of approximately 1000 ohms is placed between terminals III and V to maintain a low level leakage current from power supply 30 through space thermostat 13 and relay 1K at all times, regardless of the operation of the switches. As the space thermostat has a memory which must be continuously energized, if the thermostat circuit is broken even for a short time, the memory can be lost.Such is the case with thermostats such as the T8100 and orT8200 previously mentioned. While the use of a leakage current circuit is described in connection with an Exhaust Damper Control Apparatus, the invention is particularly applicable to other types of control apparatus which are controlled by condition responsive devices having memories which must be continuously energized.
