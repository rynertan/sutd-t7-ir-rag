## Abstract
A method of optical analysis of a test sample which comprises a sample material with light absorbing, scatter ing fluorescent, phosphorescent or luminescent properties, which sample is partly in a liquid phase and partly bound to an adjacent solid surface, to discriminate the respective parts of said sample material which are located in the liquid and bound to said solid surface comprising the steps of providing as said solid surface a surface of a transparent solid optical waveguide, and measuring light from the sample material bound to said solid surface that has passed into and through said transparent solid optical waveguide with total internal reflections and emerged from said wave guide at an angle that deviates from the optical axis of said waveguide by an angle appreciably less than α, where α arcsin n₂ ² n₁ ² where n₂ is the refractive index of the material of the waveguide and n₁ is the refractive index of the adjacent liquid, and excluding from said measurement substantially all light that has emerged from said waveguide at an angle that deviates from said optical axis by α or more.
