# Continuous vulcanizer.

## Abstract
Apparatus for continuously vulcanizing a covered material on a conductor comprises a feed device for feeding the conductor in one direction at a constant speed and an extruder for applying the covered material to the conductor fed from the feed means. A vulcanizing tube extends from the extruder, the cable passing through the vulcanizing tube. The vulcanizing tube has a curing section extending from its inlet to a location intermediate its inlet and outlet. A take off device is disposed forwardly of the valcanizing tube for hauling the cable. A load applying device is disposed between the extruder and the take off device for applying a load to the traveling cable at a location forwardly of the curing section of the vulcanizing tube, so that a tension exerted on the cable in a direction opposite to the direction of travel of the cable is applied to the traveling cable.
