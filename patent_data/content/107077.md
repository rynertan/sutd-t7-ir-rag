## Description
APPARATUS FOR MELTING AND DISPENSING THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to an apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastflc material. Conventionally, thermoplastic materials, or so called hot melt materials, are used as adhesives or sealants. These materials are characterized by being solid at room temperature and molten at a temperature substantially above room temperature, usually at a temperature on the order of 2500 to 4500 F. These materials are supplied in the molten state. Once dispensed onto the substrate, the materials are exposed to atmospheric temperature at which these thermoplastic materials set up or solidify very quickly. Hot melt adhesive applicators have evolved to contain more sophisticated electronic controls that control, for example, the temperature of the hot melt tank and the temperature of the heated hose. Although many advantages are obtained by using electronic controls, the sophisticated electrical components that they contain are effected by heat from the melt tank. Thus, in order to obtain optimum performance from the electronic controls, the temperature of the electrical components must be kept at an appropriate level. It would therefore be desirable to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic materials that utilizes electronic controls whereby the electrical components are thermally insulated so that heat from the melt tank does not adversely effect their performance. These electronic controls have at times required maintenance. In the past, access to these controls has not always been relatively easy. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material having electronic controls that are relatively easily accessible. Pneumatic systems in an air driven hot melt applicator also require maintenance from time to time. As with the electronic controls, the pneumatic system has not always been easily accessible. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material whereby the pneumatic system is easily accessible. In the past, access to the control knobs of the electronic controllers as well as the pneumatic indicators has been provided at the front of the applicator. In some applica tions it would be advantageous to provide access via the rear of the applicator to the control knobs and or the pneumatic indicators. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material that provides selective access from either the front or the rear of the apparatus to the control knobs for the electronic controls and or the pneumatic indicators. Although hot melt adhesive applicators of the past have been relatively sturdy, they generally operate in a manufacturing facility environment, and therefore, may be sometimes moved without the greatest of care. For example, a hot melt adhesive applicator with an FRP fiberglass reinforced plastic enclosure may be lifted by the enclosure. The result being that undesirable stresses are exerted on the enclosure which may damage the enclosure. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material that includes a frame that provides a lifting surface by which the apparatus can be lifted without exerting a damaging force on the FRP enclosure. Molten hot melt adhesive has on occasion leaked between the wiper seal assembly and pump shaft. In the past, this leakage accumulated on top of the enclosure. It would be desirable to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material that provides a path for molten hot melt adhesive that leaks past the wiper seal assembly to flow back into the tank.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material. It is another object of the invention to provide an improved apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material whereby the electronic controls are thermally insulated so that heat from the melt tank does not adversely effect their performance.

It should be understood that this description is in no way limiting and that various changes may be brought to the disclosed embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a specific embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the specific embodiment of Fig. 1 with the electrical control assembly and pneumatic assembly rotated 1800 Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the embodiment ofFig. 1 with the electronics, and tank enclosures blown apart from the apparatus Fig. 4 is a partial cross sectional view of the embodiment of 1 and Fig. 5 is a diagrammatic view showing the specific embodiment of Fig. 1 in a system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings, there is illustrated a hot melt adhesive applicator generally designated as 10. The applicator 10 includes a base 12 having front member 14, rear member 16, and opposite side members 18 and 20. A peripheral generally horizontally disposed integral flange 22 extends around the edge of base 12. Front member 14 and rear member 16 have access passages 28 and 30, respectively. Base 12 is formed from a sufficiently strong material such as a heavy gage steel or plastic so that the entire apparatus can be lifted at integral flange 22. By lifting the apparatus at the flange potentially damaging stresses are not exerted on the enclosures described hereinafter. An electronic control assembly generally designated as 34 34 is affixed to a plate 36. Plate 36 being affixed to portions of the flange 22 adJacent the one side member 18 of base 12.Electronic control assembly 34 includes a control panel 38 affixed to plate 36 at one end thereof and a heat sink 40 affixed to plate 36 at the other end thereof. Control panel 38 includes knobs 42 and indicator lights 43 as well as a hinged cover 44.Hinged cover 44 has a window whereby when cover 44 is closed the operator can still monitor knobs 42 and indicator lights 113. Electronic components generally designated as 49 are mounted, directly or indirectly, to plate 36. Because the control panel 38, heat sink 40 and electronic components 49 are detachably mounted to plate 36, the electronic control assembly 34 can be rotated 1800. In other words, the control panel 38 can face forward as illustrated in Fig. 1 or rearward as illustrated in Fig. 2 , The capability of rotating the electronic control assembly 34 provides apparatus 10 with a flexibility to accommodate applications in which access to knobs 42 and or indicator lights 43 by the rear of the apparatus is advantageous. One feature provided by the electronic control assembly 34 is control over the temperature of the hose. The specific details of the electronics are described in U.S. Patent Applica tion,S.N, 301,732 filed on September 14, 1981 for a CONTROLCIRCUIT, and assigned to the assignor of this patent application. The electronics enclosure 50 is made of an FRP fiberglass reinforced plastic material and is detachably mounted to plate 36. Thus, electrical enclosure 50 can be easily removed to provide relatively easy access to electronic control assembly 34. By having this relatively easy access, the maintenance of the components 49 is made easier as is the rotation of the electronic control assembly 34. A pneumatic assembly 60 is positioned within a pneumatic compartment 61. Pneumatic compartment 61 is defined within base 12. Pneumatic assembly 60 includes a dial indicator 62, a control knob 64, a mounting plate 66, an air line 68 connected to the air motor that drives the pump , a connector fitting 70, and a solenoid valve 71. Access to connector fitting 70 is provided through an aperture 72 contained in the one side member 18.Solenoid valve 71 is operatively connected to the electronic control assembly 34 by wires 73. Pneumatic assembly 60 is easily accessible since plate 66 can be removed and the assembly 60 slid out through access passage 30. Like the electronic control assembly 34, pneumatic assembly 60 may be rotated 1800 so that dial indicator 62 and control knob 64 either face forward as in Fig. 1 or rearward as in Fig. 2 . The capability of rotating the pneumatic assembly 60 provides the apparatus with a flexibility to accommodate applications in which access to dial indicator 62 and control knob 64 via the rear of the apparatus is advantageous. Applicator 10 includes a tank 76 which is mounted to base 12. A manifold 77 is mounted to the bottom of tank 76.An insulation blanket 78 surrounds tank 76 and an insulation block 79 is positioned adjacent the pneumatic assembly 60.There is also an insulative air space between the tank and the electronics as defined by the projection 72 of the electronics enclosure 50. Manifold 77 includes a drain having a drain plug 82 and a filter 84 positioned in a side by side relationship. Although the heater arrangement is not illustrated, tank 76 is a heated tank. Tank 76 is substantially identical to the tank described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 301,600 filed on September 14, 1981 for an APPARATUS FOR MELTING ANDDISPENSING THERMOPLASTIC MATERIAL assigned to the assignee of this patent application. Thus, descriptions regarding the tank including the heater arrangement and tank wall configuration are contained in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 301,600. A gasket 86 is sandwiched between the top edge 87 of tank 76 and a tank cover 88. Gasket 86 seals between tank 76 and tank cover 88. Tank cover 88 has an upstanding flange 89 at the perimeter thereof. Tank cover 88 includes a contoured cutout 91 and a rectangular cutout 90. An air motor 92 which drives pump not illustrated is mounted to tank cover 88 so that motor pump assembly passes through contoured cutout 91. Rectangular cutout 90 provides access to tank 76 through tank cover 88. The pump is a conventional double acting reciprocating piston pump. A complete description of the air motor and pump is found in U.S. Patent No. 3,585,361 issued on June 15, 1971 for a SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALS assigned to the assignee of this patent application. The The mounting of the pump is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 301,523, filed on September 14, 1981, for an APPARATUS FOR MELTING AND DISPENSING THERMOPLASTIC MATERIAL assigned to the assignee of this patent application. A tank enclosure 94 is mounted to tank cover 88 and encloses tank 76. Tank enclosure 94 includes a top surface 95 having a contoured opening 96 generally registering with cutout 91 in the tank cover and a rectangular opening 97 generally registering with cutout 90. Rectangular opening 97 is defined by a depending lip 98. A section of lip 98 adjacent contoured opening 96 is removed to form a passage 99. Passage 99 provides communication between tank 76 and the top surface of cover 88 adjacent the air motor pump arrangement. A wiper seal not illustrated seals at the pump shaft. In the event the wiper seal fails, molten hot melt adhesive may leak past the shaft and accumulate on the top of the tank cover 88. Passage 99 provides the necessary communication that allows the molten adhesive to pass into the tank 76. Thus, adhesive does not accumulate on tank cover 88 where it can solidify possibly impeding the operation of the entire apparatus. A motor enclosure 100 mounts to tank enclosure 94 so as to enclose the air motor pump arrangement. Motor enclosure 100 is removable so as to provide access to the motor. A cover 102 having opposite ends 104 and 106 is hingedly connected to tank enclosure 94. Cover 102 can be connected at either its one end 104 or other end 106 so as to open to either the left or the right. Cover 102 includes a lid 108 that is suspended from the cover by a snap f it connection. Further details of this connection are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.301,519 filed on September 14, 1981, for an IMPROVED HOUSINGFOR APPARATUS FOR MELTING AND DISPENSING THERMOPLASTIC MATERIAL and assigned to the assignee of this patent application. The operation of the apparatus is described in some detail in the above mentioned U.S. patent applications U.S.Serial Nos. 301,732, 301,600, 301,523 and 301,519 all filed onSeptember 14, 19813 . However, the general operation of the apparatus ts described below. Solid hot melt adhesive is positioned within tank 76 and power is supplied to the tank heaters. The heaters are controlled by the electronics assembly 34. The solid hot melt is heated to become molten. As can be appreciated heat is generated by the tank.The electronic assembly 34 is adequately insulated so that the electronics are not affected by the heat from the tank. The air space between the assembly 34 and tank 76, insulation blanket 78 the FRP wall of tank enclosure 94, the FRP wall of electronic enclosure 72, and insulation block 79 all function to thermally insulate the electronics. In addition, the electronic assembly includes heat sink 40 and insulation cover 41 to reduce heat build up of the electronics. Molten hot melt adhesive is pumped by the air motorpowered piston pump into the manifold. Molten adhesive flows through the manifold into a heated hose 110. The hose 110 can be connected to any one of a number of outlets 112 from the manifold. The molten adhesive is carried by hose 110 to a dispenser 114 where it is dispensed. While one form of the invention has been shown and described, other forms will now be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, it will be understood that the embodiment shown in the drawings and described above are for illustrated purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention which is defined by the following claims.
