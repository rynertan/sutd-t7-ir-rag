## Description
Techniques for the reduction of sulfur dioxide SO2 to elemental sulfur have long been known in the art. One well known method is the Claus method . In the Claus method, 502 and hydrogen sulfide H2S are catalytically converted to elemental sulfur. Typically, this is done by a multi stage process. In the initial stages, S02 is reduced to H2S . The H2S is then reac ted with more SO2 in the presence of a bauxite or an alumina catalyst at a temperature of from about 3500 to about 7000 F to form sulfur via the familiar Claus reaction EMI1.1 tb SEP catalyst, SEP tb 2H2S SEP SEP SO2 SEP 3S SEP SEP 2H20 tb The latter stage takes place in what is known as a Claus converter. U.S.Patents Nos. 2,270,427, 2,388,259, 2,431,236, 4,039,650, and 4,117,101 describe this process and variations thereof, each of these patents are hereby incorporated by refer pence. A major disadvantage of this process today is that it requires relatively expensive natural gas as the reducing agent. A second method is theso called Resox process. This process for reducing S02 to elemental sulfur with coal is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,147,762, and in Steiner, et al.Removal and Reduction of Sulfur Dioxides from Polluted GasStreams, 15 American Chemical Society s Advances in ChemistrySeries, No. 139, at 180 1975 , both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In this process, the SO2 is first mixed with steam and then passed through a reactor containing the coal.The molar ratio of steam to 502 fed into the reactor and the temperature at which the reactqr is maintained are selected to enhance the production of elemental sulfur. The process has two significant advantages 1 relatively inexpensive high sulfur coal can be used as the reducing agent and 2 the conversion traction can be conducted at temperatures that are substantially lower than those required in previously known coal conversion processes. There is however, an important disadvantage assoc iated with this process, that is, the yield of elemental sulfur is lower than in the Claus method, The present invention seeks to provide a process for reducing SO2 to elemental sulfur which mitigates the abovementioned drawbacks and problems.More specifically, the invention seeks to provide such a process which uses coal, which is relatively inexpensive, as a reducing agent, and which will produce a yield of elemental sulfur equal to or better than that produced by known processes using relatively expensive natural gas as the reducing agent, for example a better yield rate than could be achieve in a standard Claus catalytic converter. In some respects, the invention combines features of the Claus method and the Resox process described above. In accordance with a primary purpose of the invention, a proceeds for reducing SO2 to elemental sulfur comprises the steps of feeding a mixture of steam and SO2 into a first reactor, and conta cting the mixture with coal, the molar ratio of steam to 502 fed into the first reactor, the temperature of the first reactor, and t he residence time in said first reactor being suitable for the production of a product having a molar ratio of H2S to S02 in excess of 2 1 withdrawing elemental sulfur, H2S, and 502 from the first reactor recovering the elemental sulfur adding to theH2S arnd S02 from the first reactor additional SO2 such that the molar ratio of H25 to S02 is approximately 2 1 feeding the mixture of H25 and SO2 to a secondreactor contacting the mixture of H2 and SO2 in the second reactor with a suitable catalyst, and ait a suitable temperature, to form elemental sulfur and withdirawing the elemental sulfur from the second reactor. To further achieve the objects, and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described hereirn, a process for reducing SO2 to elemental sulfur comprises the steps of feeding a mixture of steam and SO2 into a first reactor, and contacting the mixture with coal, the molar ratio of steam to SO2 fed into the first reactor, the temperature of the first reactor, and the residence time in said first reactor being suitable for the production of a product having a molar ratio ofH2S t o SO2 of approximately 2 1 withdrawing elemental sulfur,H2S, and 502 from the first reactor recovering the elemental sulfur feeding the mixture of H2S and SO2 from the first reactor to a second reactor contacting the mixture of H25 and SO2 in the second reactor with a suitable catalyst, and at a suitable temperature to form elemental sulfur and withdrawing the elemental sulfur from the second reactor. The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be made more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments. The accom panying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illstrate the preferred embodiments of the invention, and, together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention. FIG. 1. is a schematic block diagram representing a first embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram representing the pre ferred embodiment of the invention. Reference will now be made in detail to the present pre ferried embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illus trated in the accompanying drawings. In accordance with the invention, a first embodiment of the process for reducing S02 to elemental sulfur is illustrated in Fig. 1. As embodied herein, 502 is mixed with a suitable amount of steam, and introduced into reactor 1 where it is contacted with a coal bed for a suitable amount of time, reactor 1 being maintained at a suitable temperature. As a result, SO2 is reduced to elemental sulfur and H2S, and the coal is oxidized. U.S. Patent No. 4,147,762, and the Steiner, et a . article cited above describe material and apparatus suitable for performing this stage of the process. The sulfur, the H2S, and any unreduced SO2 are withdrawn from reactor 1. The sulfur is recovered. To the remaining H25 SO2 mixture, additional SO2 is added, such that the molar ratio of H2 S to SO2 is approximately 2 1. This mixture is then fed into reactor 2, a Claus converter, for conversion to sulfur in accordance with the well known Claus reaction. The Claus converter is operated at standard conditions. Lastly, elemental sulfur is withdrawn from the Claus converter. The molar ratio of steam to SO2 introduced into reactor 1 H2O SO2 ratio , the temperature at which reactor 1 is maintained, and the residence time for reactor 1 are selected to enhance the production of H2S, such that the product gas from reactor 1 contains more than two moles of H2S per mole of SO2.By selecting an appropriate temperature and residence time, satisfactory results are expected with H2O SO2 ratios of from 1 to 6. The desired results have been obtained with H20 SO2 ratios ranging from 1.4 to 4.2. It is expected that most preferably, H2O S02 ratios of from 2 to 4 should be used. The appropriate temperature required is dependent on the volatility of the coal used in the coal bed. Of course, the appropriate temperature also depends on the H2O SO2 ratio and the residence time. The word coal , as used in this application, means anthracite coal, bituminous coal, coke, or any solid materials containing a sufficiently high carbon content as to produce the desirable reaction.When using anthracite coal satisfactory results are expected with temperatures of from 1300 F to 1700 F the desired results have been obtained with temperatures ranging from 1390 F to 15560 F and it is expected that most preferably, temperatures of from 14000 F to 16000 F should be used. When using a more vola tile coal, correspondingly lower temperatures can be used.Determination of such temperatures is within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. It is expected that the residence time for reactor 1 may be from 2 to 12 seconds. Satisfactory results were achieved with a residence times ranging from 2.9 to 9.2 seconds adjusted for coal consumption . But preferably it is expected that a residence time of from 4 to 8 should be used. Example 1 illustrates appropriate H2O SO2 ratios, temperatures, and residence times for enhancing the production of H25 such that the product gas from reactor I contains more than two moles of H25 per mole of sulfur dioxide. Example 1 The following compilation of data was obtained from operating a bench scale Resox pilot reactor consisting of a one inch I.D. quartz tube equipped with immersion and skin thermocouples and inserted into a vertical electric furnace of approximately 22 inches of heated length. An 11.7 inch high bed of crushed anthracite coal thru g5, on num 14 Mesh from LehighValley Coal Company was placed in the tube and supported by a stainless steel screen. The location of the coal bed with respect to the heated length of the furnace was chosen to allow six inches of heated length for the preheat section. The feed gases, N2 and SO2, were flow controlled with two independent rotameters. The dry gases were fed to the humidifier which consisted of a heated flask charged with water and equipped with an immersion thermometer. The proper amount of humidity was maintained by bubbling the gases through the water at a controlled temperature. The system pressure was measured by a manometer located between the feed rotometers and the humidifier. With the system pressure maintained at 1 2 Hg, the product gases were fed continuously to a flow through gas syringe that was used to inject samples directly into gas chroma tographs. A series of samples were thus taken. When steady state was achieved, these analyses were averaged and correlated with the remaining data. This bench scale Resox pilot reactor is illustrated in Fig.1 of U.S. Patent No. 4,147,762, and is further described at Col.2, lines 4 68 of that patent.

Initial coal charge was 112.8 gms. In accordance with the invention, the preferred embodiment of the process for reducing S02 to elemental sulfur is illustrated in Fig. 2. As embodied herein, SO2 is mixed with a suitable amount of steam, and introduced into reactor 1 where it is contacted with a coal bed for a suitable amount of time, reactor 1 being maintained at a suitable temperature. As a result, SO2 is reduced to elemental sulfur and RrS, and the coal is oxidized. U.S. Patent No. ,147,762, and the Steiner, et al.article cited above describe material and apparatus suitable for performing this stage of the process. The sulfur, the H2S, and any unreduced SO2 are withdrawn from reactor 1. The sulfur is recovered. The remaining gaseous mixture of H2S and SO2 is fed into reactor 2, a Claus converter, for conversion to sulfur in accordance with the well known Claus reaction. The Claus converter is operated at standard conditions. Lastly, elemental sulfur is withdrawn from the Claus converter. An advantage of this preferred embodiment of the invention is that for a given amount of SO2 the quantity of H2S fed into the Claus converter is reduced because a significant amount of S02 is reduced to sulfur in the first process step. As a result, for the same size Claus converter more S02 can be treated than in either the first embodiment of this invention or the Claus method, Thus, this embodiment makes more efficient use of theClaus converter than does either the first embodiment of this invention or the Claus method. The molar ratio of steam to 5 2 introduced into reactor 1, the temperature at which reactor 1 is maintained, and the residence time for reactor 1 are selected so that the product gas from reactor 1 contains approximately two moles of H2S per mole of 502, the stochiometric requirement for the Claus reaction. By selecting an appropriate temperature and residence time, satisfactory results are expected.with H2O SO2 ratios ranging from 1 to 6. The desired results have been obtained with H2O S02 ratios ranging from 1.4 to 3. It is expected that most preferably,H2O SO2 ratios of from 2 to 4 should be used.The appropriate temperature is dependent on the volatility of the coal used in the coal bed. Of course, the appropriate temperature also depends on the H2O S02 ratio and the residence time. When using anthracite coal satisfactory results are expected with temperatures of from 13000 F to 17000 F the desired results have been obtained with temperatures ranging from 963 F to 15500 F. It is expected that most preferably, temperatures of from 1400 F to 16000 F should be used. As noted above, when using a more volatile coal, correspondingly lower temperatures can be used.Determination of such temperatures is within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. It is expected that the residence time for reactor 1 may be from 2 to 12 seconds. Satisfatory results were achieved with residence times ranging from 2.9 to 9.2 seconds. But preferably it is expected that a residence tir of from 4 to 8 should be used. By selecting appropriate H2O SO2 ratios, temperatures, and residence times a product gas containing approximately two mole of H2S per mole of SO2 can be achieved, as is illustrated in Ru 2 of Example I, and Examples II, III, and IV. Example II Example II illustrates an appropriate H20 S02 ratio, temperature, and residence time which may be used in accordance with the present invention to obtain a product gas from reactor 1 having a molar ratio of H2S to SO2 of 2.1 1. This data was obtained from operation of the Resox pilot reactor having a height of 6.33 ft., a cross sectional area of 0.3171 sq. ft., and a volume of 2.0 cubic ft. The reactor had a coal bed moving at a rate of 2.25 ib. per hr., such that 2.0 of the bed was discharged per hour.
