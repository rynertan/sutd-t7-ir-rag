## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an apparatus for quickly ironing cloth articles in general. As it is known a presently very relt problem is that or quickly ironing cloth articles, such as clothes ana the Iike,mainly made of wool,knitted rabrics or other like fabrics. On the other hand it is also known that ironing by the conventional steam ironing devices is a rather difficult operation,requiring a lot of time. That problem, in addition to being a very important one for home applications, is also very important in hotels,communities ana the like, therein the cloth article are to be ironed in a time as little as possible, Other known solutions for ironing cloth articles general provide for the use or an inflatable manikin. thereonthe cloth article to be ironed is laid to be successively acted upon by steam and hot air jets this solution,however,may be adop d only in ironing 3hop8 or especially equipped rooms ltus it can not be adopted in the above mentioned oases or in small size rooms. S MAILY OF EHE INVENTION Accordingly the main object or the present invention is to provide an apparatus for quickly ironing cloth articles in general icn is effective to allow for the cloth articles to be quickly ironed by using constructionally simple and low cost means. Another object or the present invention is to proviae such a quick ironing apparatus which is effective to be easily handled and transported, is of reduced size and may be usea by unskilled operators. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for quickly ironing cloth articles in general which is very flexible in operation and which,ihile being structurally very simple , is effective to surely operate. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a quick ironing apparatus which is particularly effective to be used in hotels, small communities as well as in home applications. According mo one aspect of the present invention, the thereinabove mentioned objects as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinaftert are achieved by an apparatus ror quickly ironing cloth articles in general, characterized in that it comprises a base body thererrom a vertically extending post extends,de ining at the top thereof a cloth article supporting portion water containing vessel being provided in said body, said water being causea to evaporate by a proviaea electrical resistance,a flexible duct communicating with said vessel and being provided with a steam delivery outlet. 1E DESCRIPTION OP 2HE DR4WING Further characteristics and advantages will become more apparent thereinafter from the following detailed description of an apparatus for quickly ironing cloth articles in general, being illustrated by way of an indicative but not limitative exaniple, in the accompanying drawing the one figure thereof is a schematic perspective view illustrating the ironing apparatus according to the present invention DwSCRIP ION OF THE PREFERRED 3oD T With reference to the figure of the accompanying drawing, the apparatus for quickly ironing cloth articles in general,according to the present invention, comprises a base body 1,which has preferably though not necessarily a parallelepipedal shape,and which is mounted on sliding wheelstor being quickly displaced from an use place to another use place. Moreover, on the top surface thereof, the base body 1 is provided with a gripping handle indicat ed at 3. From the base body 1,a vertical stem or post 4 extends which latter is provided, at the top thereof, with a cloth article supporting means, which lattersavantageously consists of a hook segment , thereon the hanger 6 may be applied for supporting the cloth article 7. In the inside of the base body 1 there is provided a water containing vessel or tank lO,which is provided, at the top thereof, 1iith an inlet opening effective to be closed by a plug member 11, and accessible from the top surface of said base body 1. Inside the vessel 10 there is provided an electrical resistance 12,for electrically heating water contained in the vessel 10, to bring said water to its vaporization temperature. The electrical resistance 12 is electrically coupled to the mains through the interposition of a control thermostat 13 A flexible duct is moreover provided, indicated at 20 and coznnrwiicating with the water vessel 10, said flexible duct being provided at one end thereof with a steam delivery outlet 21. The ironing apparatus is further provided with a warning lamp 30 effective to signal the operative condition of the apparatus and also provided on the base body 1. The apparatus according to the present invention operates in a very simple way. Infact,ror quickly ironing a cloth article, it will be sufficient to apply to the hook member 5 said cloth article 7 and, after having switched on the apparatus, wait for the delivery or steam through the outlet 21 and cause the steam delivery outlet 21 to pass in the proximities of the cloth article thereby ejecting on said cloth article steam jets, effective to quickly and efficientlS iron the cloth article fibers, mainly in the case of a wool or knitted fabric. As the ironing apparatus is not used, the hook member 5 will act as a support for the steam delivery outlet or fitting 21. Prom the above disclosure it should be noted tha the ironing apparatus according to the present invention fully achieves the intended objects. In particular it should be noted that the subject apparatus is a very flexible and efficient one. In fact, since it is of very reduced size and may be easily handled, may be directly and quickly brought to the use place, therein it is possible to quickly obtain a delivery of steam, the temperature and. flow rate thereof may be adjusted by means of the mentioned thermostat 1Ã‡. Thus the ironing apparatus according to the present invention is particularly suitable for large hotels, therein the need is felt of quickly ironing a lot of cloth articles without using the conventional apparatus whidh are of large size and very expensive. In particular the steam jets, hich are ejected with a great speed, allow for the cloth articles to be perflec2ly ironed. In practicing the invention the used materials, as well as the contingent shapes and size may be any according to needs.
