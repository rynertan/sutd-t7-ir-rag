## Description
Title Substituted Phenylnitramines with Plant Growth Regulating Properties The herbicidal properties of phenylnitramines and their use for the control of weeds is described in United States PatentNo. 3,844,762, issued October 29, 1974 to B. Cross et al. , in which novel methods for the control of undesired plant species are disclosed by employing certain substituted phenylnitramines. The geotropic response of roots of rape and ryegrass, and the selective reduction of root growth when seeds of said plants are grown in the presence of phenylnitramines is described by R. L. Jones et al., Journal ofScience and Food Agriculture 5,.38 1954 . The effect of 2,4,6 tribromophenylnitramine and 2 chloro 9 fluorenol 9 carboxylic acid applied preemergence to groundsel and chickweed is described by W. Templeman, Proceedings of the British Weed Control Conference 1, 3 1954 . It states that, although weed control is achieved at 11.2 and 16.8 k vha, these compounds possess very little selectivity and most crops, which have been examined, have also proved to be susceptible. None of the above references even slightly suggest the novel plant growth regulating activity of substituted phenylnitramines also known as N nitroanilines and salts thereof, nor indeed could such activity be predicted therefrom. The present invention in one aspect relates to methods for the control of the relative stem growth of graminaceous crops, leguminous crops and cotton, comprising applying to the foliage stems, roots or seeds of said plants, or to the soil in which said plants are grown, a plant growth regulating amount of a phenylnitramine orN nitroaniline having the structure EMI2.1 wherein R1 is halogen, C1 C4 alkyl, CN, CO2CH3, SO2CH3, SO2F, S02GF3, C1 C3 haloalkyl, C1 C3 haloalkoxy or N02 R3 is halogen, methyl or methoxy R5 is halogen, CF3, methoxy or C1 C4 alkyl with the proviso that not more than two of said R groups may represent fluorine, and the salts thereof. Preferred haloalkyl substituents are CF3, CCl3, CHF2,CClF2, CHF2, CH2Cl and CHCl2. Preferred haloalkoxy substituents are OCF3 and OCHF2. A preferred group of compounds are those wherein R1 is CF3,I, C1 or Br R3 is Br, C1 or I and R5 is C1, Br or I, provided that not more than two of said R groups may be iodine, and the salts thereof. The above compounds are effective plant growth regulating agents, and are especially useful for reducing the relative stem growth and increasing the stiffness hereinafter also referred to as dwarfing and stiffening of said stems, of cotton and of graminaceous crops, such as barley, oats, rye, wheat, sorghum, corn and rice.Usually about 0.025 to 1.5 kg ha, and preferably 0.05 to 1.25 kg ha ofactive compound, is sufficient to achieve this dwarfing and stiffening effect. For broadleaf crops, such as bean producing legumes, about 0.01 to 0.5 kg ha of active compound is sufficient to achieve this dwarfing and stiffening effect. Dwarfing and or stiffening of the stems of cotton, legumes and graminace ous crops is most advantageous to the farmer since lodging of these crops usually results in reduced yields of the affected crops. Lodging refers to the deflection of the plant from the vertical, varying in degree from only a slight deflection to complete deflection i.e. plants prone caused by, in most cases, the action of wind and or rain on the plants. This deflection is such that when the causal agent wind, rain is no longer present the deflection is neither immediately nor completely overcome. Moreover, where extensive or severe lodging has occurred, the crop may be difficult to harvest and the yield markedly reduced. Inasmuch as the compounds of the present invention have only limited solubility in water, they are generally formulated for foliar application as wettable powders, flowable dispersions or emulsion concentrates, which are usually dispersed in water or in other, inexpensive, liquid diluents for application to the foliage of said plants as a liquid spray. However, when the compounds are to be used where soil treatments are involved, they may also be formulated as granular products. A typical wettable powder can be prepared by grinding together approximately 46 by weight of a finely divided carrier such as attapulgite, 50 by weight of the phenylnitramine compound, 3 by weight of the sodium salt of condensed naphthalene sulfonic acids and 1 by weight of sodium N methyl N oleoyltaurate. A typical flowable dispersion can be prepared by admixing about 42 by weight of the phenylnitramine with about 3 by weight of the sodium salt of condensed naphthalene sulfonic acids, ZS by weight of finely divided bentonite and 53 by weight of water. Emulsion concentrates may be prepared by dissolving 15 to 70 by weight of the compound in 85 to 30 of a solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, kerosene, 2 methoxy ethanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, formamide, methylformamide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Advantageously, surfactants such as polyoxyethylated vegetable oil or an alkyl phenoxy polyoxyethylene ethanol are also incorporated in amounts of 1 to 5 by weight of said concentrate. A granular product can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitable solvent, such as acetone, and spraying the resultant solution on a granular carrier such as sand, silica, kaolin, corn cob grits, and the like. Most of the compounds of formula I herein are novel, and form an important aspect of the present invention. Specifically, the novel compounds of formula I are those wherein R1 R3 and R5 are as defined above but with the proviso that not more thar two of saidR groups may represent the same substituent and the ammonium salts thereof. In accordance with this invention, the phenylnitramines can be prepared from the correspc nding substituted anilines by a variety of conventional procedures. For illustrative purposes, one such procedure is hereinbelow graphically illustrated and described as follows EMI4.1 wherein R1, R3 and R5 are as hereinabove defined. The above synthesis is conveniently carried out in a solvent, such as acetic acid, preferably in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as acetic anhydride. The product may be precipitated from the reaction mixture by the addition of ice water. Purification may be effected by conventional procedures such as recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. The phenylnitramines, wherein R1 and or R5 are haloalkyl or hydroxyalkyl and R3 is halogen, can be prepared by a two step synthesis involving Step 1, the reaction of the appropriate haloalkyl aniline or haloalkoxyaniline with halogen e.g. chlorine or bromine in the presence of an acid acceptor such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, or the like, in the presence of an inert organic solvent e.g. tert butanol, CCl4, ethylene dichloride, chlorobenzene, or the like . The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of from 250C to 75 C, and preferably at a temperature of about 450C to 550C. The reaction yields the corresponding 2,4,6 trisubstituted aniline, which may then be converted, in Step 2, to the corresponding 2,4,6 trisubstituted phenyinitramine by reaction with nitric acid in the presence of a solvent, such as acetic acid, and a dehydrating agent, such as acetic anhydride. Steps 1 and 2 can be graphically illustrated as follows Step 1EMI5.1 wherein R1 and R5 are haloalkyl or haloalkoxy, and X is chlorine or bromine. Step 2EMI5.2 wherein R1, R5 and X are as described above. The ammonium salts of the phenylnitramines can be conveniently prepared by dissolving the appropriately substituted compound in warm to hot water and adding one molar equivalent or slight excess of ammonium hydroxide to the solution. On cooling the mixture, the ammonium salt usually precipitates out. The above reaction may be graphically illustrated as follows EMI6.1 The alkali metal salts may be prepared by the same procedure. Organic ammonium salts of formula I compounds may be prepared by related procedures. Of particular interest are organic ammonium salts of 2 trifluoromethyl 4, 6 dihalophenylnitramines and 2,4,6 trihalophenyl nitramines. To prepare these, and organic ammonium salts of other phenylnitramines, the appropriate phenylnitramine is dissolved in benzene or toluene, and a one molar equivalent or slight excess of the appropriate amine is added. Formation of salt is rapid at room temperature or with gentle warming and upon cooling, the salts usually precipitate from the solution. Those ammonium salts, which have appreciable solubility in the above solvents, may be precipitated from the solution by the addition of a lower alcohol such as methanol or ethanol. Although benzene or toluene are preferred, other solvents, such as ether, cyclohexanone, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, alcohols, hydrocarbons, ethyl acetate, acetone, carbon tetrachloride and mixtures thereof, may be utilized in this salt forming reaction, if desired. The above organic ammonium salts may be graphically illustrated and described as follows EMI6.2 wherein R1, R3 and R5 are as defined above Z is selected from H3N R , H2NR R , H N R R R and N R R R R and R groups Rt to R each are selected from C1 C12 alkyl, C2 C4 hydroxyalkyl, aryl, preferably phenyl and substituted phenyl, wherein the sub stituents are selected from halogen and C1 C6 alkyl and aralkylC1 C3, preferably benzyl and substituted benzyl, wherein the substituents are selected from halogen and C C6 alkyl, and when two of the Rt and R t t groups are taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached they may form a heterocyclic ring. A preferred group of ammonium salts represented by formula 1b are those wherein R1 is CF3, and R3 and R5 are bromine Z is selected from H2N CH3 2, H2N C4H9 n , H3N CH2CH2OH, H2N CH2CH2OH 2,H3N C8H11 n, H3N C12H25 n,EMI7.1 Among the compounds of the invention which are particularly effective for inhibiting lodging of cotton, legumes and graminaceous crops are 2,4,6 tribromo N nitroaniline 4 chloro 2,6 diiodo N nitroaniline 2,4 dibromo 6 iodo N nitroaniline 2,6 dibromo 4 chloro N nitroaniline 2,6 dichloro 4 iodo N nitroaniline 2,4 dibromo alpha , alpha , alpha trifluoro N nitro o toluidine 2 bromo 4 chloro 6 iodo N nitroaniline 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 iodo N nitroaniline 2 chloro 4,6 diodo N nitroaniline 2,4 dibromo 6 chloro N nitroaniline 2,6 dibromo 4 iodo N nitroaniline 4 bromo 2,6 diiodo N nitroaniline 4 bromo N nitro 2,6 xylidine 4 bromo 2,6 dichloro N nitroaniline 2 bromo 4,6 diiodo N nitroaniline 2,6 dibromo N nitro p anisidine 2,4,6 trichloro N nitroaniline 2,4 dibromo 6 alpha , alpha difluoro N nitro o toluidine 2,4 dibromo 6 a, a ra trichloro N nitro c toluidine 2,4 dibromo 6 a, a dichloro N nitro o toluidine 2,4 dichloro 6 alpha , alpha ,a trifluoro N nitro o toluidine 4 bromo 2,6 a, a a ditrifluoro N nitro 2,6 xylidine 2,4 dibromo 6 alpha , alpha , alpha trifluoro N nitro o anisidine 2, 4 dibromo 6 a fluoro N nitro o toluidine 2,4 dibromo 6 alpha chloro N nitro o toluidine 2 nitramino 3,5 dibromobenzoic acid, methyl ester 2 nitramino 3,5 dibromobenzonitrile 2, 4 dibromo 6 methylsulfonyl N nitroaniline 2,4 dibromo 6 a, a difluoro N nitro o anisidine 2 nitramino 4,6 dibromobenzenesulfonyl fluoride 2,6 dibromo 2 nitro N nitroaniline 2,6 dibromo 4 fluoro N nitroaniline 2 bromo 2,6 difluoro N nitroaniline 2,4 dibromo 6 isopropyl N nitroaniline 2 bromo 4,6 dichloro N nitroaniline 2 chloro 4,6 diiodo N nitroaniline, diisopropylamine salt and 3, 3,5 dibromo 2 nitraminobenzenesulforyl fluoride. This invention is further illustrated by examples set forty below.

The acidic filtrate is extracted with chloroform 2 x 200 ml , and the chloroform layer is washed with water 2 x 200 ml . The chloroform layer is extracted with 10 aqueous sodium carbonate, and both of the above carbonate solutions are combined, washed with chloroform, cooled to iO0C and acidified with ice cold 2N hydrochloric acid to precipitate the phenylnitramine product. The nitramine is filtered, washed with cold water, dried in vacuo and recrystallized from the appropriate solvent. If desired, the above chloroform solution may be evaporated to dryness to afford a mixture of the desired product, the unreacted aniline and side products. The impurities may be separated by conventional procedures, such as selective crystallization, extraction, chromatography, and the like.

ExAMPLES 7 18Evaluation of the Dwarfing and Stiffening Effect of the Phenylnitramines of the Present Invention on Barley In the following tests, the appropriate phenylnitramines are dissolved or dispersed in acetone water 1 1 mixtures at the final concentration corresponding to the kg ha rates indicated in the tables below. The solutions also contain 0.1 to 0.25 v v colloidalBIOFILM a trade mark of Colloidal Products Corp. which is a mixture of alkyl aryl polyethoxyethanol, free and combined fatty acids, glycol ethers, dialkylbenzene carboxylate and 2 propanol. The plant species used in these tests are barley Hordeum vulgare var. Villa and var. Larker , wheat Triticum aestivum var.Era and var. Garnet and rice Oryza sativa var. Saturn . The solution or dispersion of the compound under test is sprayed at a rate of 747 ljha with a moving nozzle over a stationary track. The spray nozzle moves at a constant speed over the test species. In the preemergence test, containers are filled to within 2.5 cm of the top with greenhouse potting soil, seeds are added, covered with additional potting soil, and then sprayed. The pots were watered immediately before treatment and benched at random in the greenhouse. Normal watering and fertilizing practices are followed pesticides are applied to the plants as needed . Minimum day and night temperatures of 18.3 C are maintained during cooler periods of the year. Normal daily fluctuations occur during the summer season. Postemergence tests are conducted in like manner the preemergence tests. However, the plant species employed in these tests are well established seedlings 10 to 20 cm in height. Plaits are watered prior to treatment and are sprayed to provide the kg ha rates indicated in the tables below.Data Recording Periodic observations are made after treatment and morphological changes are noted. At the time of observation, the height of plants is determined. If the plants are maintained to maturity and harvested, second internode lengths and second internode diameters are also determined. From these measurements, as compared to the untreated controls, the dwarfing effect of the instant compounds on barley can be determined.Measurement of Calm Stem Stiffness Six to eight plants, forming a straight row, are pulled over to an angle of approximately 45 off vertical with a spring balance attached through a loop of string encircling said line of plants directly below the top. The force required to pull the plants over is read off the spring balance and is given in grams. At each level of active compound, the treatments are replicated, as are the controls.

Individual plants growing in 10 cm sq. pots in high porosity soil are sprayed with test solutions or suspensions, prepared as 50 50 water acetone mixtures containing 0.25 of a surfactant, when the plants are at the three leaf to very early tillering stage. The sprayer is an overhead sprayer designed to deliver 86 gallons acre of solution or suspension and is located about 26 cm above the plants. Plants are measuredon the day of treatment and again 18 days after treatment when the dwarfing effect of the test compound is determined. During the test, all plants are fertilized with liquid fertilizer four times a day, except weekends, when they are only watered.The fertilizer is a complete one containing 200 ppm N, 166 ppm K, 30 ppm P, plus all other essential nutrients.
