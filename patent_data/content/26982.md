## Description
COATING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING MONO OR DI ESTER COALESCENTS This invention is concerned with aqueous coating compositions, such as latexes, containing insoluble polymer and, as coalescent there foam, certain mono or di ester compounds. Films made from many synthetic polymer latexes, particularly acrylic and vinyl ester latexes, are known to have excellent physical properties including superior elasticity, resilience, elongation at break, and pigment binding power and excellent chemical properties, such as resistance to hydrolysis and solvent attack.Because of these properties, latexes of these polymers are used extensively in many interior and exterior coating applications. Unfortunately, many such latexes having the aforementioned desirable properties are not film forming in many conventional coating applications. In order to overcome this deficiency, it has been a common practice to add a nonvolatile organic liquid, such as alkyl phthalate esters and phosphate esters commonly referred to as plasticizers , to the latex. These plasticizers soften the resin particles thereby promoting their coalescence into a continuous film. However, their presence in the films made from the latexes render the films soft and tacky, thereby causing dirt accumulation problems during drying and blocking problems during and after drying. Blocking is defined as the undesired adhesion between touching layers of material. In order to overcome these problems, it has become a common practice to add a volatile plasticizer often referred to as a transient plasticizer or fugitive coalescing agent to the latex. See, for example, TheApplications of Synthetic Resin Emulsions byH.Warson, published in 1972 by Ernest Benn Limited,London, Chapter III, General Polymer EmulsionApplication . However, to be effective, the volatile plasticizer must not cause latex destabilization during its addition to the latex commonly referred to as shock , must maintain a high coalescence efficiency and must not produce odour during evaporation. It has been found that certain compounds, such as aliphatic glycols, aliphatic glycol esters, aromatic glycol ethers, esters of phenol and acetate capped glycol ethers are acceptable as fugitive coalescing agents in most coating applications. Common examples of these include ethylene glycol phenyl ether 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,3 pentanediolmonoisobutyrate and diethylene glycol n butyl ether acetate.Unfortunately, these plasticizers evaporate slowly and or have poor hydrolytic stability, thus increasing drying times and intervals between recoating. European Patent Application 79.102029,Publication No.0006571, discloses aqueous latex caulking compositions plasticized by a combination of a water insoluble adduct of an alkylene oxide and an alkyl phenol, and an ester type of plasticizer.There are well known differences between caulks and coatings. It is not obvious to employ plasticizers designed for caulks, which are formulated at high pigment volume and high solids and applied in thicknesses far greater than the thicknesses of the coatings of this invention which are generally applied by the usual painting procedures to form films having a dry thickness in the usual paint range, such as from about 0.1 to about 10 mils. Thus the volatility and other property requirements of a plasticizer for a caulk can be expected to be very different from those of a coating. No caulk plasticizer named in the reference is an ester coalescing agent for the latex paints of the instant application. The esters used in the caulks are essentially permanent plasticizers. U.S.Patent 3,312, 652, discloses the use of 3 hydroxy 2,2,4 trimethylpentylisobutyrate as a coalescing agent. This compound may leave a coating containing it too slowly and be sensitive to water. U.S.Patent 4,111,881, discloses polyoxyhydrocarbylene dihydrocarbyl ethers as coalescing agents for synthetic polymer latexes.These compounds may suffer from water sensitivity in the coating and can be absorbed perematurely into porous substrates. T.R.Hopper in Paint Varnish Prod.56 2 2 , pages 31 33, 35, 37, and 64 1966 discusses Use of Phosphates, Phthalates and Adipates in Latex Paints, Lacquers and Vinyols . The specific adipate mentioned is dioctyl adipate which has a considerably higher boiling point than the esters of this invention. U.S.Patent 2,536,470 discloses paint formulations based on polyvinyl acetate emulsions and containing various plasticizers. The plasticizers are taught as being more or less permanent and are structurally different from those of this invention. The patent describes the plasticizers in detail in column 5, line 20 to column 6, line 62. The various plasticizers disclosed are not sufficiently volatile for the purposes of this invention or have the types of shortcomings mentioned hereafter. U.S. Patent 2,720,496 discloses the addition of plasticizers to polyvinyl acetate. The plasticizers structurally different from those of this invention, are described in column 2, lines 56 to 68, the esters among them being based on citric acid, phthalic acid or phosphoric acid. U.S. Patent 3,790,520 discloses acrylate polymer compositions comprising aliphatic glycols and or aliphatic glycol ethers. The presence of hydroxyl groups in these materials may result in the deficiencies described hereafter. As a result of the higher price of energy and thus of air conditioning, a recent development in architectural practice is the trend away from sealed windows back toward movable sash windows. Movable sash windows require coatings with a very high degree of block resistance to prevent sticking. Thus this property assumes a new importance in the coatings marketplace. Thus it is necessary for an aqueous paint to dry rapidly and to form a film with high block resistance while at the same time the necessity for film formation at low temperatures must not be lost. We have now found that certain hydrolytically stable esters may function as coalescents and provide a desirable balance of block resistance and low temperature film formation. According to this invention there is provided an aqueous coating composition comprising a water insoluble addition polymer preferably having a Tg above OOC., more preferably above 250C., most preferably above 400C. or even 500C., and containing an effective amount of certain ester coalescing agent. The addition polymer is generally obtained by emulsion polymerization. The improved composition of the invention results from the use as a coalescing agent, of certain mono and di ester compounds. These esters are hydrolytically stable, preferably highly so, and are particularly useful in alkaline coating formulations. The esters preferably have normal boiling point between 160 and 290 C., more preferably at least 180 C., most preferably between 215 and 285 or. The esters are mono and di esters of lower alcohols other than methyl, lower glycols, monobasic acids, including aromatic acids and dibasic aliphatic acids. The ester, generally the sole coalescing agent, is used in an effective amount, preferably up to 40 , more preferably between 5 and 25 , most preferably between 10 and 20 based on the weight of the addition polymer. In general, it is preferable that the ester have from 8 to 14 carbon atoms in the molecule, more preferably from 10 to 12.The compositions of this invention, based on the particular esters, may exhibit a number of desirable properties including one or more of 1 surprising stability even when the compositions are alkaline, 2 high rate of hardness development, 3 high block resistance even at elevated temperature, and 4 ease of film formation at low temperature. The present invention embraces clear compositions as well as aqueous base paints, containing pigments, dyes and or other coloring material, adapted for both interior and exterior uses. The present invention is concerned with the modification of aqueous addition polymer dispersions, generally obtained most conveniently by direct emulsion polymerization. The most important of these dispersions used in making water based paints are polymers, including homopolymers and copolymers, of 1 vinyl esters of an aliphatic acid having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, especially vinyl acetate 2 acrylic acid esters and methacrylic acid esters of an alcohol having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, especially methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate and 3 monoand di ethylenica ly unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, isobutylene, styrene, and aliphatic dienes, such as butadiene, isoprene, and chloroprene. Poly vinyl acetate and copolymers of viny acetate with one or more of the following monomers vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, ethylene, styrene, vinyltoluene, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrlel and the acrylic and methacrylic acid esters mentioned above are well known as the film forming component of aqueous base paints.Similarly copolymers of one or more of the acrylic or methacrylic acid esters mentioned above with one or more of the following monomers vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, styrene, vinyltoluene, acrylonitrile, and methacrylonitrile are also more or less conventionally employed in aqueous base paints. flomopolymers of ethylene, isobutylene, and styrene, and copolymers of one or more of these hydrocarbons with one or more esters, nitriles or amides of acrylic acid or of methacrylic acid or with vinyl esters, such as vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride, or with vinylidene chloride are also used. The diene polymers are generally used in aqueous base paints in the form of copolymers with one or more of the following monomers styrene, vinyltoluene, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and the above mentioned esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.It is also quite common to include a small amount, such as 1 2 to 7 or more, of an acid monomer in the monomer mixture used for making the copolymers of all three general types mentioned above by emulsion polymerization. Acids used include acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, aconitic, citraconic, crotonic, maleic, fumaric, the dimer of methacrylic acid, and so on. These aqueous dispersions may be made using one or more emulsifiers of anionic, cationic, or non ionic type. Mixtures of two or more emulsifiers regardless of type may be used, except that it is generally undesirable to mix a cationic with an anionic type in any appreciable amounts since they tend to neutralize each other. The amount of emulsifier may range from about 0.1 to 6 by weight or sometimes even more, based on the weight of the total monomer charge.When using a persulfate type of initiator, the addition of emulsifiers is often unnecessary and this omission of the use of only a small amount, e.g., less than about 0.5 , of emulsifier, may sometimes be desirable from the cost standpoint elimination of expensive emulsifier , and less sensitivity of the dried coating or impregnation to moisture, and hence less liability of the coated substrate to be affected by moisture, which, for instance, would produce coatings less liable to swelling or softening, particularly when subjected to humid atmospheres. The average particle size or diameter of these dispersed polymers may be from about 0.03 to 3 microns or even larger. The particle size, whenever referred to herein, is the weight average diameter .This number, expressed in microns, is determined using the ultra centrifuge. A description of this method can be found in the Journal of Colloid Science 15, pp 563 572, 1960 J. Brodnyan . In general, the molecular weight of these emulsion polymers are high, e.g. from about 100,000 to 10,000,000 viscosity average, most preferably above 500,000. It is preferred that the glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer be above 0 C., more preferred that it be above 250C. and most preferred that it be above 40dC. or even 50 C. A preferred upper limit of Tg is 1000C with 85eC being more preferable. The glass transition temperature may be estimated by the ca culation based on the Tg of homopolymers of individual monomers as described by Fox, Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1, 3, page 123 1956 . Tables of the Tg of homopolymers are given in Polymer Handbook Brandrup and Immergut, editors, 2nd Edition, John Wiley Sons, New York 1975 Section III, Part 2, Lee and Rutherford. A particularly advantageous use of the coalescents of this invention is with very hard polymers, those having Tg greater than 400C. and indeed even greater than 500C. Hard polymers require comparatively high levels, such as up to 40 preferably 5 to 25 and most preferably 10 to 20 on polymer solids, of coalescent ester to achieve film formation at temperatures used for home painting, such as 10 to 300C. The compositions may be clear or pigmented and are particularly useful in high gloss, water based enamels and varnishes. These compositions are formulated to produce coating which have gloss, so as to compete with trade sales oil based enamels and varnishes, without having the constraints and long term film stability problems of the oil base systems.As the high Tg polymers require a comparatively high level of coalescing agent, the coalescing agent tends to be retained for long periods of time, thus agents of the prior art which were useful at low levels and which leave the coating needed film slowly cannot be used at the high levels for the high Tg polymers. The coalescing agents of this invention leave the film at a high rate thereby producing films having block resistance and hardness after a comparatively short period. It is preferred that the polymer be polymerized in the absence of the polyester coalescent, particularly in the absence of an effective amount, of the coalescent. Coalescent present during the polymerization tends to lead to the formation of undesirable floc or gel particles in the latex. The coalescing agents used in the present invention are mono esters or di esters having one of the following formulae EMI10.1 wherein R1 is alkyl or aryl, R2 and R4 are the same or different alkyl groups other than methyl, andR3 is alkylene or vinylene, or, in formula B , a single bond. It is preferred that the total number of carbons in the ester be from 8 to 14, more preferably from 10 to 12. In formula A when R1 is aliphatic it is preferably a 3 to 7 carbon group and R2 is a preferably 4 to 8 carbon atom alkyl group when R1 is aromatic it is preferably a phenyl group and R2 is preferably a 3 to 5 carbon atom alkyl group.In the case of the diesters of formula B ,R2 and R4 are preferably 3 or 4 carbon atom alkyl groups R3 may be a single bond, when the diester is an oxalate, but is preferably a 2 to 5 carbon alkylene or vinylene group. When the polyester is of formula C R3 is preferably a 4 carbon atom alkylene group and R2 and R4 are preferably 2 or 3 carbon atom alkyl groups. The following is a table of the boiling points of several preferred esters. The first 15 being particularly prefered and the first 6 being the most preferred of all.Compound. Boiling Point, C butyl benzoate 247 diisopropyl adipate ca. 250 dibutyl maleate 280.5 dibutyl fumarate 284 diisopropyl fumarate diisopropyl maleate 228 1,3 butanediol diisobutyrate 1,3 butanediol diisoproprionate di n propyl adipate isopropyl benzoate 218 amyl butyrate 185 isopropyl oxalate 190 butyl hexanoate 208 butyl butyrate 165 isoamyl butyrate 178 hexyl 2 ethylbutyrate 232 2 ethylbutyl hexanoate 238 hexyl hexanoate 244 hexyl 2 ethylhexanoate 254 2 ethylhexyl 2 ethylbutyrate 255 diisopropyl pimelate ca. 275 amyl benzoate In general methyl esters and ether esters are to be avoided because they produce an instability in the paint system possibly because of ease of hydrolysis of the ester. This point is illustrated in the data of Example 1 below.Esters or diesters having substituted alkyl groups in the molecule, such as those with hydroxyl or amide groups, tend to leave the film too slowly or to be lacking in compatibility with the polymer and are therefore also to be avoided. Ethers, ether esters and compounds with the substituted alkyl groups described tend to have greater water solubility than the esters of the instant invention. The greater water solubility often leads to removal of these molecules from the wet paint film during the first stages of drying by wicking into porous substrates. The result is poor film formation due to the absence of coalescent as drying proceeds. The coalescing agent is used in at least a coalescing amount which is an amount that will facilitate the formation of a continuous film on drying a coating under the conditions for the particular use.For trade sales coatings the drying is preferably under outdoor ambient conditions. The coalescing agent will be present in an amount which will vary with the latex and the ester used. In some formulations low amounts such as in the range of 1 to 5 will be useful however, in most situations the amount used will be up to 25 with the range 10 to 20 being preferred all being based on the weight of dry polymer. The preferred formulations may be clear, that is, free of pigments, or pigmented and in either case may contain the conventional adjuncts used in paint formulation. The adjuncts may include thickeners, dispersants, defoamers, surface active agents, pigments, biocides and protective colloids. In pigmented systems the coatings composition may contain about 15 to 90 latex polymer solids, about 10 to about 85 adjuncts on a dry basis and a level of coalescing agent indicated above. The composition will ordinarily also contain between about 25 and about 75 weight percent of volatiles principally water. The compositions of the present invention are applied to substrates by the usual painting procedures such as brushing, spraying, rolling, dipping, flow coating etc., to form films having a dry thickness in the usual paint range such as from about 0.1 to about 10 mils. In the following examples, which are illustrative of the invention, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.

Unless specified otherwise hardness and block retention are measured by the method given in Table II below and coalescent retention is determined by a gas liquid chromatography measurement performed on a sample of paint recovered from an impermeable substrate. Example 1 Paint Stability The effects of two controls Texanol and butyl Carbitol acetate, butyl benzoate and a series of adipate esters on the storage stability of paints, formulated as given above, are determined using aCorning pH meter, Model 7 and a Stormer Viscometer, in accordance with A.S.T.M. standard Method D 562, herein incorporated by reference. Paints containing the various coalescents are stored at 60 C. for 10 days the pH and viscosity are determined before and after aging. Results are tabulated in Table I.The latex polymer employed is a polymer of monomers comprising acrylate and methacrylate esters, styrene and unsaturated acid, the polymer having a Tg of about 50 0C as determined by measurement of torsional modulus of a film as a function of temperature.

In Table I, a paint is considered stable if there is no significant change in either pH or viscosity during the storage period. While the high temperature storage stability of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate is very poor, for the series of adipate esters, stability improves going from dimethyl to dibutyl and becomes acceptable at diethyl adipate. The storage stability of paints coalesced with butyl benzoate is very good. FThe decrease in pH and increase in viscosity on storage at 600C. are both believed to be evidence of hydrolysis of the coalescing agent when the agent contains an ester group. Regardless of the chemical mechanism involved in these changes the ester coalescing agents of this invention formulated into a paint and tested by the procedure of this Example are classified as follows Hydrolytic Property Change in 10 days at 600C.Stability EE Viscosity KU excellent below 0.5 below 15 good below 0.8 below 20 fair acceptable below 1.0 below 25 unacceptable 1.0 or more 25 or moreThus an ester is of excellent hydrolytic stability when the paint formulated therefrom exhibits a change of less than 0.5 pH units and less than 15 Krebs units on ageing 10 days at 600C.Example 2 Hardness Development and Block Resistance Both the block resistance, the tendency of a paint film to stick to itself or another surface when pressure is applied, and the hardness of a paint film, as measured by a Yukon Hardness Tester No. FB 1066 with a 25g. load Wilson Instrument Division of American Chain Cable Co. Inc. , are dependent on the rate of escape of a coalescent from a paint film. Hardness and block resistance are measured for a series of paints, formulated as given above, containing various coalescents, including butyl benzoate, a series of adipates, and Texanol as the control coalescent.Results are shown in Table II. The polymer latex is the same as that in Example 1.

The higher the KHN, the harder the film.2 Block resistance is determined by casting a 1.5 mil dry film of paint on whiteLenetaTM charts and allowing the paints to dry at 25 C 55 R.H. for the specified period of time. Two squares of approximately 2 sq. in. each are cut from the coated chart, sandwiched together, paint film to paint film and placed on an aluminum tray. A 1000 g. weight is then placed on a num 8 rubber stopper large end up on top of each square so that the pressure under the stopper is approx. 2 psi. The entire apparatus is then placed in a 50 C. oven for 30 min. After 30 min. the apparatus is removed from the oven, diassembled, and allowed to equilibrate to room temp. for 15 min. before separating the coated squares.The paint films are then subjectively rated for the degree to which the squares stick together using a scale of 0 to 10. 0 is a complete seal between the two paint films and 10 is no sticking whatsoever. Paints containing butyl benzoate or the adipate esters listed in Table II develop hardness and block resistance at a faster rate than the Texanol containing control paint, despite the proximity of their boiling points.Example 3 Low Temperature Film Formation 10 C 70 R.H.

All of the coalescents in Table III with the exception of Butyl Carbitol are efficient coalescing agents for the latex polymer.Example 4 Hardness Development in a Clear Film Coalescent is added to an all acrylic latex based on methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate, having a Tg of about 220C, which is then cast to form a clear film.The coalescents employed are butyl benzoate, of this invention, and Texanol, a control. Under both ambient and elevated temperature drying conditions the butyl benzoate escapes from the all acrylic latex significantly faster than the Texanol and gives a more rapid hardness development as indicated in Table IV below.This difference in rates is unexpected in view of the 1 difference in boiling point between the two coalescents, the Texanol being the lower boiling.

Two squares of approximately 2 sq. in. each are cut from the coated chart, sandwiched together, paint film to paint film and placed on an aluminum tray. A 1000 g. weight is then placed on a num 8 rubber stopper large end up on top of each square so that the pressure under the stopper is approx. 2 psi. The entire apparatus is then placed in a 50 C. oven for 30 min. After 30 min. the apparatus is removed from the oven, diassembled, and allowed to equilibrate to room temp. for 15 min. before separating the coated squares.The paint films are then subjectively rated for the degree to which the squares stick together using a scale of 0 to 10. 0 is a complete seal between the two paint films and 10 is no sticking whatsoever.

The results are given in Table V, below. It is seen that the coalescent of this invention is more effective in producing both a hard film and a block resistant film than the combination of the materials of the prior art.

In inspecting the data of Table VI it should be borne in mind that the different coalescents may differ in their ability to soften the polymer thus some varnish samples after one or two weeks may have modest amounts of the coalescents of this invention yet still be comparatively soft. It is clear that the block resistance of coatings formulated utilizing the coalescents of this invention are far better than the control even after one week and within a month the hardness of the film formed utilizing the coalescents of this invention exceeds that of the control.

Although little different in boiling point, and if anything slightly higher boiling, when compared to Texanol, diisopropyl adipate also developes hardness much faster than the Texanol. In the case of block resistance, both of the coalescents of this invention are much better than Texanol and in order to differentiate between the low boiling and high boiling esters of this invention measurements are made at a higher temperature, 1400F, which show the greater block resistance of the lower boiling material. The high temperature storage stability of these paints is good as measured by pH and viscosity measurements made after storage for ten days at 600C.In low temperature film formation n butyl butyrate is found to be less effective than isopropyl adipate presumably because of its high evaporation rate thus implying that its area of greatest utility may be in industrial coatings applications where controlled factory conditions prevail and where greatest advantage may be made of its rapid evaporation from the film.

The ormulation given is for 20 coalescent on binder latex solid level. Suitable adjustment is made in the amount of coalescent to obtain other levels of coalescent employed in this example. Table VIII gives the results of determining hardness as a function of drying time and of low temperature film formation studies, carried out as in Example 3 above, for three coalescents of this invention and two controls, Texanol and dibutyl phthalate. Dibutyl phthalate has a boiling point of about 335 C, above the boiling point of the coalescents of this invention and, as is seen in TableVIII leads to poor hardness development in a paint film. The three ester coalescents of this invention give better hardness development than the corresponding levels of Texanol.With this comparatively high Tg latex it is seen that at least 25 Texanol is required for good low temperature film formation whereas only 20 of the coalescents of this invention are needed. With 30, 35 and 40 of the coalescents of this invention the low temperature film formation remains excellent but the rate of hardness development is somewhat protracted and the film does become harder than the film employing either of the controls. With higher Tg latex polymers the higher levels of coalescents of this invention, 30, 35 and 40 on latex polymer, are useful in obtaining good low temperature film formation while still maintaining acceptable hardness development whereas the Texanol and dibutyl phthalate materials do not achieve an acceptable balance of these properties.
