# Overspeed safety device.

## Abstract
In a pneumatically powered rotating grinding machine there is provided a safety unit 13 comprising a speed governor and an overspeed release mechanism the purpose of which is to ensure a predetermined maximum speed. For safety reasons, the motor speed must never exceed a certain critical speed level which is determined by the mechani cal strenght of the working tool attached to the machine. When choosing working tool to be attached to the machine the maxi mum speed mark of the machine is decisive. By having a portion of the safety unit exposed through an aperture 57 in the tool housing 10 and having the maximum speed mark 52 of safety unit 13 located to the exposed portion, the maximum speed mark of the machine will always be the same as that of the safety unit 13 . The suggested overspeed safety device avoids the risk involved in the fact that a machine carrying a cer tain maximum speed mark might be erroneously fitted with a safety unit 13 intended for a higher maximum speed.
