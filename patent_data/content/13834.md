## Description
Method of Converting a Hydrophilic, Water ContainingRegenerated Cellulose Membrane to a Membrane Useful for Separating Organic Liquids This invention relates to a method of converting a hydrophilic, watercontaining membrane to a membrane useful for separating organic liquids.More particularly, this invention relates to a process for converting semipermeable membranes made from regenerated cellulose to membranes useful for organic liquid separation. Still more particularly, this invention relates to converting hydrophilic membranes made from regenerated cellulose to membranes useful for organic liquid separation by permeating a watercontaining membrane with a sequential series of solvents of decreasing polarity, under pressure, to successively displace the water in the membrane with each of said solvents ultimately ending with a solvent miscible with the organic liquid to be selectively permeated through the membrane. It also relates to a method for separating certain selected organic liquids from mixtures thereof with other organic liquid materials by contacting the mixture, under pressure, with one side of the semipermeable, regenerated cellulose membrane, as modified by the previously recited technique. The membrane preferentially permeates the selected solvent through the membrane to produce a permeate richer in said selected solvent and a retentate leaner in said solvent than the original mixture. This selected solvent separation process has particular application in solvent dewaxing processes wherein a waxy hydrocarbon oil is mixed with a dewaxing solvent to form a slurry comprising solid wax particles and a mixture of dewaxed oil and solvent wherein said slurry is passed to filtration means for separating the wax from the dewaxed oil solvent mixture and the dewaxed oil solvent filtrate is separated by contacting, under pressure, with the previously recited modified regenerated cellulose membrane. At least a portion of the dewaxing solvent permeates through the membrane to form a permeate richer in the dewaxing solvent and a retentate leaner in the solvent than the original filtrate. The thus recovered dewaxing solvent permeate is recycled to the dewaxing operation, the retentate being passed to conventional solvent oil separation means. In a more particular application solvent used to recover foots oil from slack wax may also be recovered using the selectively permeable modified regenerated cellulose membrane.Slack wax is heated and mixed with solvent which dissolves the foots oil, resulting in a slurry comprising wax and solvent foots oils. The wax is separated by filtration from the solvent foots oil and solvent is recovered by contacting the solvent foots oil filtrate, under pressure, with one side of the modified semipermeable membrane which selectively permeates the solvent from the foots oil.2. Description of the Prior Art It is well known in the art to use semi permeable membranes for hydrocarbon separation processes. Such processes are often referred to as reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration processes. In such processes, the feed, comprising a mixture of at least 2 different hydrocarbons, is brought into contact with one side of a membrane across which a pressure differential exists, for a period of time sufficient to form two solutions a permeate which passes through the membrane and a retentate. A useful review of these processes may be found, for example, in an article titled Novel Device and Process Design Concepts for a Large ScaleMembrane Separation of Hydrocarbon Mixtures by Michaels et al., Seventh World Petroleum Congress Proceedings, v. 4, p. 21 1967 .It is also well known to use membranes such as various cellulose esters including cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose propionate, etc. as well as cellulose ethers such as ethyl, propyl and amyl cellulose and the like for these processes. U.S. Patent No. 2,930,754 discloses the use of cellulose ester membranes such as cellulose acetate butyrate for separating various hydrocarbons such as n heptane from mixtures of n heptane and isooctane and toluene from mixtures of toluene and isooctane, using membranes at pressure differentials ranging from about 10 100 psig across the membrane. Where the feed is a mixture of toluene and isooctane, for example, the permeate is richer in toluene while the retentate is richer in isooctane.Using a series of membranes results in substantial separation of one hydrocarbon from the other. U.S. Patent No. 2,958,657 discloses the use of membranes made of ethyl cellulose for separating hydrocarbons such as n heptane and isooctane wherein the temperature of the process is sufficiently hot to cause one of the hydrocarbons in this case isooctane to vaporize and form an isooctane rich permeate. That is the hydrocarbon mixture is present in the feed zone in the liquid phase whereas the permeated hydrocarbons are removed as vapors. U.S. Patent No. 2,985,588 discloses hydrocarbon separation wherein the rate of permeability across or through the membrane is increased by adjusting the temperature of the process so that it is above the first order transition temperature of the polymeric material comprising the membrane.Membrane materials disclosed in this patent include cellulose triacetate, ethyl cellulose and irradiated polyethylene.U.S. Patent No. 2,960,462 discloses the use of dual layer membranes for hydrocarbon separation wherein the membrane is a composite of a higher permeation material and a lower permeation material such as cellulose esters and cellulose ethers or cellulose esters and irradiated polyethylene, etc. U.S.Patent No. 2,958,656 discloses that the rate of selective permeation of hydrocarbons through non porous cellulose ester and acetate membranes can be increased many fold by contacting the membrane, during permeation, with a nonhydrocarbon solvent material including oxygenated compounds such as alcohols, ethers, alcohol ethers, ketones and chlorinated compounds. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 2,947,687 discloses that the permeation rate through a non porous, semi permeable cellulose ester membrane may be improved by contacting the membrane, during the permeation process, with a substituted hydrocarbon which is soluble in and has solvent power for the membrane. Still further, U.S. Patent No.3,043,891 discloses a similar process and achieves a similar purpose by using aromatic and unsaturated non oxygenated solvents. Unfortunately, adding a membrane solvent to the feed causes the membrane to soften and become very weak which often results in membrane rupture. Thus, U.S.2,923,749 discloses adding saturated hydrocarbons to the feed mixture in order to act as a diluent thereby permitting increased permeation through the membrane at a lower temperature or pressure at the expense of membrane solubility. It is also important to note that all of these prior art processes maintain a vacuum on the permeate side of the membrane so that the permeate is removed as a vapor. Thus, it has generally been concluded that cellulose acetate membranes are not, in general, suitable for organic feed mixtures, even through they appear good enough for other i.e. aqueous separations applications c.f., ReverseOsmosis by Sourirajan, chapter 7, Academic Press, 1970 .In Membrane Processes For Effluent Treatment by D. Pepper,Chemistry and Industry, p. 834 836 October 15, 1977 , it is stated that commercially used reverse osmosis membranes are usually made from cellulose acetate or polyamide. Finally, the French have used acrylonitrile copolymer membranes in a reverse osmosis process for the ultrafiltration removal of impurities from used motor oils as disclosed in an article titled Regeneration of Used Lubricating Oils by UltraFiltration by D. Defives et al., Information Chimie, No. 175 p. 127 131 March, 1978 . This article also states that if these acrylonitrile copolymer membranes are used in the presence of a solvent immiscible with water, such as a hydrocarbon solvent or oil, they are not wetted and are thus impermeable to the hydrocarbon.In order to function in a non aqueous medium, the article states that the membranes must be conditioned by using a solvent that is both miscible with water and with the solvent under consideration, such as acetone or a low molecular weight alcohol. However, it was found that if the oil contained a sufficient amount of surfaceactive agents and was under sufficient pressure, the oil succeeded in progressively wetting the moist membranes, thus eliminating the solvent conditioning required on a laboratory scale. Interestingly, it has been stated with authority that the most. useful membranes to convert to use for organic liquids are cellulose membranes, but that cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate membranes are soluble in too large a variety of organic solvents to be useful. Progress inSeparation and Purification, v. 3, Perry and VanOss, eds., p. 122 124 Wiley Interscience, 1970 . This reference states that in order to impregnate a hydrophilic membrane with a water immiscible liquid, the membrane has to be soaked in a series of successive baths of the following composition 30 water 70 ethanol, 5 water 45 ethanol 50 butanol, 100 butanol renewed 3 times , 70 butanol 30 oil, 30 butanol70 oil, 100 oil.Cellophane as such could not be impregnated with any non aqueous liquid that was tried unless it was first treated with concentrated ZnCl2. Unfortunately, this treatment destroys the membrane selectivity required for many hydrocarbon separations. Various processes are well known in the art for separating certain selected organic liquids from mixtures thereof with other liquid organic materials. This is accomplished through various absorption desorption processes, solvent extraction, extractive distillation and various evaporation processes including gas stripping, flash evaporation and distillation. These processes generally require large amounts of thermal energy, pumps, tankage, etc. The use of semi permeable membranes to accomplish hydrocarbon separations consumes little, if any, thermal energy and consumes relatively little energy. It is well known that wax containing hydrocarbon oils such as lube oil fractions of petroleum oils must be dewaxed in order to obtain therefrom a useful product. There are many different ways and techniques of dewaxing these stocks, but for all practical purposes most commercial operations employ solvent dewaxing processes. In such processes the wax containing oil is contacted with a cold dewaxing solvent or mixed with a dewaxing solvent at about the same temperature of the oils and then chilled in a scraped surface chiller in order to produce a waxy slurry which is then fed to rotary vacuum or pressure drum filters to separate the solid particles of wax from the dewaxed oil dewaxing solvent solution. The dewaxing solvent must then be removed from a mixture of dewaxed oil and solvent in order to obtain a dewaxed lube oil stock.This is done by thermal means such as passing the solvent containing oil through a distillation tower or a series of distillation towers and or evaporation zones in order to boil off the solvent from the oil. Residual amounts of solvent and oil are generally removed therefrom via steam or inert gas stripping. These solvent recovery operations require considerable amounts of thermal energy, pumps, tankage, etc. in order to remove the solvent from the dewaxed oil. It would be a great improvement to the art if a dewaxing process could be developed that included a method for separating the dewaxing solvent from the dewaxed oil by relatively low energy consuming non thermal means. Warm up deoiling of lube oil slack wax is well known in the art. In such a process the slack wax is warmed up and mixed with solvent to dissolve the foots oil in the slack wax, thereby forming a slurry comprising solid particles of wax and a solution of foots oil and solvent. This slurry is then filtered, usually in a rotary drum filter, to separate the foots oil solution from the solid wax particles as a filtrate.The foots oil containing filtrate is then sent to solvent recovery operations to recover the solvent from the foots oil solution, with the recovered solvent then recycled back into the warm up deoiling operation. The solvent recovery is accomplished by thermal means such as passing the solventcontaining oil through a distillation tower or a series of distillation towers and or evaporation zones in order to boil off the solvent from the oil. Residual amounts of solvent and oil are generally removed therefrom via steam or inert gas stripping. These solvent recovery operations require considerable amounts of thermal energy, pumps, tankage, etc.in order to remove the solvent from the foots oil. It would be an improvement to the art if a warm up deoiling process could be developed that included a method for separating solvent from the foots oil by relatively low energy consuming non thermal means. Therefore, because regenerated cellulose or cellophane membranes are not very soluble in most organic materials, including typical organic dewaxing solvents are relatively low in cost, are readily available and relatively high in strength, it would be a significant improvement to the art if one could convert them to membranes useful for separating organic liquids without diminishing their natural selectivity. It would also be an improvement in the art if a solvent dewaxing process or a lube oil slack wax warm up deoiling process could incorporate the use of these membranes in their solvent recovery steps and if the recovered organic liquid did not have to be removed from the permeate side of the cellulose membrane as a vapor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that hydrophilic, watercontaining regenerated cellulose membranes can be converted to membranes useful for separating organic liquids by sequentially permeating the water containing membrane with one or more solvents of decreasing polarity, under pressure, to first displace the water in the membrane with the first solvent and then sequentially displace each solvent in the membrane with the next, successive solvent of lower polarity, beginning with a low molecular weight alcohol or ketone which is miscible with water and ending with a solvent miscible bulk miscibility with both the higher polarity solvent immediately preceding it and the liquid organic material or solvent desired to be permeated through the membrane. Further, the above recited modified regenerated cellulose is useful in organic liquid separation processes.Such processes typically comprise contacting mixtures of organic liquids under pressure, with one side of the modified semi permeable, regenerated cellulose membrane previously described and permeating a portion of said mixture through said membrane to form a permeate and a retentate different in composition from each other and from said mixture. The mixture to be contacted with the membrane will be a feedstock comprising a mixture of one or more selected organic liquids with one or more different liquid organic materials. The regenerated cellulose membrane must selectively permeate said selected organic liquid or mixture thereof to produce a permeate richer in said selected organic liquid and a retentate leaner in said selected organic liquid than said feedstock.In a preferred embodiment the organic liquid selected to be permeated will comprise one or more solvents. Such selective solvent permeation has particular application in a solvent dewaxing process wherein a waxy hydrocarbon oil is solvent dewaxed to form a slurry comprising solid particles of wax and a liquid mixture of dewaxed oil and dewaxing solvent, passing said slurry to filtration means for separating the solid wax particles from the dewaxed oil solvent mixture to form a wax cake and a filtrate comprising said dewaxed oil solvent mixture and contacting said filtrate, under pressure, with one side of the modified semi permeable membrane made from regenerated cellulose as previously described that preferentially permeates at least a portion of said dewaxing solvent through said membrane to form a permeate richer in said solvent and a retentate leaner in said solvent than said filtrate. In a preferred embodiment the waxy hydrocarbon oil is a lube oil stock. The selective solvent permeation also has applicability in recovering solvent used in slack wax deoiling processes comprising warming up cold slack wax and mixing it with solvent to dissolve the foots oil contained therein to form a slurry comprising solid particles of wax and a solution of foots oil and solvent, separating the solid wax from the foots oil containing solution and contacting the solution with one side of a semi permeable membrane made from regenerated cellulose that selectively permeates at least a portion of the solvent from the solution to form a permeate richer in solvent and a retentate leaner in solvent than said solution.It is understood that the slack wax is obtained by solvent dewaxing a waxy lube oil stock which produces a slurry comprising solid particles of wax and a mixture of dewaxed oil and solvent. This slurry is sent to solid liquid separation means, such as a rotary drum filter, wherein the wax is deposited on the filter drum as a wax cake and the solution of dewaxed oil and solvent removed from the filter as a filtrate. The wax cake is washed with solvent while on the filter drum. The washed wax cake removed from the filter drum is known as slack wax . This slack wax contains significant amounts of wax or waxy oil having a melting point broadly ranging from about 300F. to 800F. which is referred to in the art as foots oil . It is necessary to remove the foots oil from the slack wax in order to produce a higher quality wax product having a higher melting point. In all of the above by semi permeable membrane it is meant that the membrane selectively permeates at least one component from a mixture of organic liquids. The term regenerated cellulose describes cellulose which has been dissolved by virtue of the production of a soluble chemical derivative, such as cellulose xanthate, and subsequently reprecipitated. When prepared as a fiber, regenerated cellulose is commonly known as viscose or viscose rayon. As a film, regenerated cellulose is known by the generic term cellophane . Thus, the regenerated cellulose or cellophane membranes useful in this invention do not in clude the relatively solvent soluble cellulose ether and cellulose ester membranes described under the Prior Art, supra, which have not met with commercial success for hydrocarbon separations.The regenerated cellulose or cellophane membranes useful in this invention are commercially available, as hydrophilic membranes, from various companies for various aqueous ultrafiltration processes and are normally supplied containing a glycol such as glycerol. The glycerol is present as a hermectant in order to prevent drying out of the membrane.If the membrane is allowed to dry out, its internal cell structure irreversibly collapses, thereby rendering the membrane useless for ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis processes. If the membrane contains or is coated with a glycol or other hermectant, the glycol must be removed first. This may be done simply by soaking the membrane in water at room temperature in order to swell the membrane and to displace the entrained glycol. The water containing membrane is then ready to be converted or modified into a semi permeable membrane, useful for separating organic liquids according to the process of this invention. It is to be understood, that at no time must the membrane be allowed to dry out whether it contains water or a solvent or other liquid. For obtaining rapid selective permeation, a thin membrane is employed which, in general, will be less than about 10 mils, preferably less than 5 and still more preferably no crreater than 2 mils in thickness. The membrane employed should be free from holes and other defects which would destroy its semi permeable nature. If the membrane has pinholes or the like, this will permit all of the organic liquids to leak through, thereby reducing or even eliminating the selectivity of the membrane. As heretofore described, supra, the process of this invention comprises converting the hydrophilic membrane to a membrane useful for separating organic liquids by sequentially permeating the water containing membrane with a series of solvents of decreasing polarity, under pressure, beginning with a low molecular weight alcohol or ketone which is miscible with water bulk miscibility and ending with a solvent miscible bulk miscibility with both the higher polarity solvent immediately preceding it and the organic material or solvent desired to be permeated through the membrane. It is preferred that the final solvent permeated through during the conversion treatment be of a size and shape similar to the material to be selectively permeated.It is also understood, of course, that none of the materials permeated through the membrane should react with, dissolve or otherwise adversely affect the membrane. This may be more readily understood by the following sequential treatment used to convert a glycerol containing regenerated cellulose membrane to a membrane capable of selectively separating MEK methyl ethyl ketone from a lube oil MEK solution a. water soak membrane to swell same and displace the glycerine b. permeate methanol through the water containing membrane under pressure i.e., 200 400 psi and c. permeate MEK through the methanol containing membrane under pressure i.e., 200 400 psi .A membrane modified by this treating sequence water methanolMEK will also selectively permeate toluene or a mixture ofMEK toluene from a lube oil containing toluene or a mixture of MEK toluene, respectively. Another illustrative, but nonlimiting example is for the case where it is desired to separate propane from a dewaxed lube oil stock. To do this, step c. above can be followed by permeation of propane under pressure. However, propane will not permeate through the membrane if step c. is omitted. Thus, the sequence watermethanol propane will not work. The sequence water methanoltoluene propane will work as will the sequence water methanolMEK pentane propane.Although it is preferred to follow the pentane permeation step with a propane permeation step, the propane permeation step can be accomplished in situ by using the oil propane solution that one desires to remove the propane from. Thus, it should also be noted that the final solvent permeated through the membrane can be done in situ by contacting the membrane with a mixture containing said solvent i.e., if it is desired to permeate MEK or a mixture of MEK toluene, step c. above can be done in situ by contacting the membrane with the MEK or MEK toluene containing organic liquid mixture or oil . As has heretofore been stated, the first treating solvent permeated through the water containing membranes is selected from the group consisting essentially of a one or more low molecular weight one to four carbon atom alcohols and b acetone or mixture thereof, said solvent exhibiting bulk liquid liquid miscibility with water. Illustrative materials include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol, sec butanol, isobutanol and acetone. Particularly preferred are the one to three carbon atom alcohols. The treating solvents must be permeated through the membrane at a differential pressure across the membrane in order to displace the water from same. This pressure may range from about 100 to 800 psi or more. The maximum pressure should be somewhat less than the crushing pressure of the membrane while the practical lower pressure limit is con trolled by that pressure needed to displace the material from the membrane. By way of example, the minimum pressure for water is about 100 psi. For MEK the minimum pressure is also about 100 psi. Preferred are pressure differentials across the membrane ranging from about 150 800 psi, while from about 200 400 psi is particularly preferred.The second, successive solvent to be permeated through the membrane must be less polar than and exhibit bulk liquid liquid miscibility with the first solvent and be more polar than and exhibit bulk liquid liquid miscibility with the third solvent or material to be permeated. Thus, the solvent treatment sequentially progresses with solvents of continuously decreasing polarity wherein there is bulk liquid liquid miscibility between any two adjacent solvents in the sequential series. An illustrative but non limiting example of solvent polarity is illustrated in Table 1 which lists a number of solvents of decreasing polarity as a function of dielectric constant. The lower the dielectric constant, the less polar is the solvent.The term solvent as used herein, is not meant to exclude materials not normally regarded as solvents and includes materials such as naphthas, jet fuels, light oils, middle distillates, etc. As has heretofore been stated, supra, regenerated cellulose membranes useful for ultrafiltration processes are commercially available from a number of suppliers. These membranes are sold in terms of molecular weight cut off ranges or equivalent pore size . The pore size of a semi permeable membrane cannot be categorically stated for many reasons. Pore size may be too small to be measured by physical methods.Pore sizes change with temperature and with each solvent saturated within the membrane due to swelling or shrinkage, etc. A common approach used in the industry is to distinguish solvents too large to diffuse through the membrane from those small enough to diffuse through it. This can be accomplished using a membrane sizing kit. A list of twelve standard compounds used to size membranes is shown in Table 2. These compounds are roughly spherical in shape.The molecular weight cut off is quoted as the formula weight of the compound which is 98 retained by the membrane. Thus, a a regenerated cellulose membrane sold as having a molecular weight cut off of from between about 6,000 to 8,000 will, in general, not permit permeation of generally spherical protein molecules having a molecular weight exceeding from about 6,000 to 8,000. Thus, one must select that membrane having a pore size such that it will provide the desired selectivity after treatment. While not wishing to be held to any theory, it is believed that the solvent treatment of this invention alters the so called pore size .By way of illustration, it is believed a regenerated cellulose membrane having a molecular weight cut off of from about 6,000 to about 8,000, has a pore size having a diameter of roughly about 24A. After treatment with the solvent series water methanol MEK, the pore size it is believed to shrink to a diameter of roughly about l2A. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 schematically illustrates a laboratory apparatus used in the examples of this invention. Figure 2 illustrates permeation rate as a percent of oil in an oil solvent feed as a function of regenerated cellulose membranes having three different molecular weight cut offs. Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of a process of the instant invention employing modified, semi permeable, regenerated cellulose. Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of a process of the instant invention employing modified, semipermeable regenerated cellulose.EXAMPLES The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples. Referring to Figure 1, the laboratory apparatus used was a Millipore holder defined by top 10 and bottom 12 and containing spacer 14 to define liquid spaces 16 and 18 for the feed and permeate, respectively. Spacer 14 contains a teflon coated, star shaped magnetic stirrer 20 separated from membrane 24 which is clamped between spacer 14 and Millipore bottom 12. Magnetic support 22 is porous, is approximately 1 10 inches thick and merely serves to prevent magnetic stirrer 20 from abrading membrane 24. The teflon coated starshaped magnetic stirrer is rotated by means not shown in order to prevent or minimize the boundary layer on the feed side of membrane 24. In operation, the feed liquid is introduced under pressure into liquid space 16 and one or more components of the feed selectively permeates through membrane 24 to form a permeate in liquid space 18.The permeate is continuously removed from the apparatus and analyzed. When used as a batch apparatus, the retentate is that material which did not permeate through the membrane and which has a composition different from both the feed and permeate.EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates that even under a differential pressure across the membrane of up to 400 psi, a regenerated cellulose membrane will not permeate MEK unless the membrane has been treated according to the process of this invention. In this experiment a Spectrum Medical Industries regenerated cellulose membrane designated as Spectrapore 1 having a nominal thickness of 0.002 inches and a molecular weight cut off MwCO of 6,000 8,000 was placed in a MilliporeFilter Holder modified as described above. This Membrane contained glycerine to prevent it from drying out. Before it was placed in the Millipore Holder, the glycerine was removed by soaking in distilled water for over one hour. The apparatus was then charged with MEK under a pressure of 400 psi at a series of successive temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 1300C and held at 1300C for two days. After two days noMEK was observed to have permeated through the membrane. EXAMPLE 2 In this example, the same type of membrane and apparatus was used as that used in Example 1. The feed used was a mixture of 20 LV of a dewaxed, paraffinic, lube oil raffinate having a viscosity of 600 SUS at 100OF in a 30 70 volume percent mixture of MEK MIBK. Various samples of glycerol wet membrane were pre treated at room temperature using the procedures and at the corresponding feed pressures shown in Table 3. Each membrane sample was pretreated in the apparatus and a given quantity of feed contacted with the retentate side of the membrane at a pressure of 400 psig. The pressure at the permeate side of the membrane was one atmosphere. In all cases where permeate came through the membrane, it came through and was collected in the liquid form. The feed permeation temperature for each run is shown in Table 3.The feed was contacted with the membrane until the amount of permeate shown came through the membrane 5 days for run M 37 , and then both the permeate and retentate were recovered. The permeate was then analyzed for oil solvent composition. For those cases where there was no observable permeate, the experiment was terminated after about 24 hours. Thus, that data show that it is necessary to permeate the solvents through the membrane, under pressure. Merely soaking the membrane in solvent is not adequate.EXAMPLE 3 In this experiment the apparatus heretofore described was used along with a Spectrum Medical Industries regenerated cellulose membrane designated as Spectrapore 3500 having a molecular weight cut off MWCO of 3500 and a nominal thickness of 0.002 inches which was pretreated by soaking in water to remove the glycerine, followed by placing the glycerol free membrane in the apparatus and pretreating same with a sequential solvent treatment of methanol, followed byMEK, under a pressure of 400 psi at room temperature. The apparatus was charged with three different paraffinic, dewaxed lube oil raffinates in ketone or ketone toluene solutions as shown in Table 4. For each run the feed pressure was 400 psig and the pressure on the permeate side of the membrane was one atmosphere.The runs were terminated after 50 LVZ of the feed had permeated through the membrane and the permeate analyzed for oil and solvent content. The results are shown in the Table. In each case the permeate comprised over 98LV solvent.EXAMPLE 4 In this experiment the membrane was a Spectrapore 1 such as that used in Example 1, but preconditioned by first soaking in water and then sequentially permeating the following solvents through the membrane at a temperature of 210C and a pressure of 400 psig methanol MEK pentane propane. The membrane was preconditioned while in the apparatus heretofore described and kept in contact with liquid propane at 150 psig in order to prevent the membrane from drying out. A feed comprising a mixture of 20 LV bright stock in propane was charged to the apparatus contacting one side of the membrane at a pressure of 600 psig. A pressure of 150 to 200 psig was maintained on the permeate side of the membrane so that the propane permeated through as a liquid. At 50 LV permeation of the feed the accumulated permeate contained about 95 LV liquid propane.EXAMPLE 5 This example illustrates the effect that the membrane pore size or molecular weight cut off can have in processes employing this invention. Samples of membrane having molecular weight cut off s shown in Figure 2 were pre conditioned by soaking in water to remove the glycerine, followed by placing the glycerine free membrane in an apparatus similar to that used for Examples 1 4. The glycerine free membrane was then sequentially treated with methanol followed by MEK, at room temperature and a pressure of 400 psig. The feed was a solution of 10 grade lube oil stock viscosity of 1,200 2,400 centipoise at 18 C in a 40 60 volumes volume mixture of MEK MIBK. The concentration of the oil in the feed varied as is shown in the Figure.Thus, it is seen that increasing molecular weight cut off size of the membrane increases the permeation rate of the solvent.

The membrane was also converted to a membrane useful in the process of this invention using the same sequential treatment shown in Example 1. The feed used was a 50 50 liquid volume mixture of MEK toluene.The feed pressure was 400 psig with a pressure of one atmosphere on the permeate side of the membrane. The permeation was done at a temperature of 16 C and yielded a permeate containing 42.8 LV liquid volume of toluene and 57.2 LV of MEK. It should be understood that any solvent dewaxing process, wherein it is eventually desired to separate the solvent from the dewaxed oil, can be benefited by employing the modified semi permeable regenerated cellulose membrane previously described. One such solvent dewaxing process involves indirect heat exchange in a scraped surface chiller wherein waxy oil and solvent, at approximately the same temperature, are mixed in such a manner so as to effect complete and thorough solution of the oil in the solvent before being cooled or chilled. This solution is then cooled at a uniform, slow rate under conditions which avoid agitation of the solution as the wax precipitates out. Another well known method of solvent dewaxing processes involves conventional, incremental solvent addition.In this method, solvent is added to the oil at several points along a chilling apparatus. However, the waxy oil is first chilled without solvent until some wax crystallization has occurred and the mixture has thickened considerably. A first increment of solvent is introduced at this point in order to maintain fluidity, cooling continues and more wax is precipitated. A second increment of solvent is added to maintain fluidity. This process is repeated until the desired oil wax filtration temperature is reached, at which point an additional amount of solvent is added in order to reduce the viscosity of the mixture to that desired for the filtration step. In this method the temperature of this incrementally added solvent should also be about the same as that of the wax oil solvent mixture.If the solvent is introduced at a lower temperature, shock chilling of the slurry occurs resulting in the formation of small and or acicula shaped wax crystals with attendant poor filter rate. Still another well known process is the DILCHIL process wherein a waxy oil is introduced into an elongated, staged cooling zone or tower at a temperature above its cloud point and incrementally introducing a cold dewaxing solvent into said zone, along a plurality of points or stages therein, while maintaining a high degree of agitation so as to effect substantially instantaneous mixing of the solvent and wax oil mixture as they progress through said zone. The basic concept is shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,773,650, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference and shall hereinafter be referred to as dilution chilling.The processes of this invention are autorefrigerative dewaxing processes wherein a waxy oil is mixed with a liquid autorefrigerant which is then allowed to evaporate from the oil under controlled conditions thereby chilling the oil by the latent heat of evaporation of the autorefrigerant. Any solvent useful for dewaxing waxy petroleum oils may be used in the process of this invention. Representative examples of such solvents are a the aliphatic ketones having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone MEK and methyl isobutyl ketone MIBK , and b low molecular weight autorefrigerant hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane, butane and propylene, as well as mixtures of the foregoing and mixtures of the aforesaid ketones and or hydrocarbons with aromatics such as benzene, xylene and toluene. In addition, halogenated, low molecular weight hydrocarbons such as the C1 C4 chlorinated hydrocarbons, e.g., dichloromethane, dichloroethane, and mixtures thereof, may s Registered service mark of Exxon Research and Engineering Company. be used as solvents either alone or in admixture with any of the forementioned solvents. Any waxy petroleum oil stock or distillate fraction thereof may be dewaxed employing the process of this invention. Illustrative, but nonlimiting examples of such stocks are a distillate fractions that have a boiling range within the broad range of about 500OF to about 1300OF, with preferred stocks including the lubricating oil and specialty oil fractions boiling within the range of between about 550OF and 1200OF, b bright stocks and deasphalted resids having an initial boiling point above about 800OF and c broad cut feed stocks that are produced by topping or distilling the lightest material off a crude oil leaving a broad cut oil, the major portion of which boils above about 500OF or 650OF. Additionally any of these feeds may be hydrocracked prior to distilling, dewaxing or topping. The distillate fractions may come from any source such as the paraffinic crudes obtained from Aramco, Kuwait, the Pan Handle, North Louisiana, etc., naphthenic crudes, such as Tia Juana, Coastal crudes, etc., as well as the relatively heavy feed stocks, such as bright stocks having a boiling range of 1050 OF and synthetic feed stocks derived from Athabasca Tar Sands, etc. Referring to Figure 3, a waxy lube oil stock at a temperature above its cloud point is introduced into the top of DILCHILL dewaxing tower 20 via line 22. DILCHILL tower 20 contains 16 agitated stages for mixing the waxy oil with cold dewaxing solvent. Cold dewaxing solvent is introduced into tower 20 via lines 10 and 12, manifold 14 and multiple injection points 16. Each of the injection points introduces cold solvent into a particular stage wherein the cold dewaxing solvent is substantially instantaneously i.e., one second or less mixed with the waxy oil. As the waxy oil progresses down tower 20, it forms a slurry comprising solid particles of wax and a mixture of dewaxed oil and dewaxing solvent.This so formed slurry is removed from tower 20 via line 24 and passed to filter 26. The cold slurry may also be addi tionally chilled in a scraped surface chiller not shown before it is passed to filter 26. Filter 26 is a rotary drum filter wherein the wax is separated from the slurry thereby forming a cake of solid wax and a filtrate comprising a mixture of dewaxed oil and dewaxing solvent. The wax is removed from filter 26 via line 28 and sent to further processing. The filtrate is passed to at least one membrane unit 32 wherein it contacts, under pressure, one side of a plurality of modified, semi permeable membranes made from regenerated cellulose at a differential pressure across the membrane ranging from about 100 to 800 psi.A substantial portion of the dewaxing solvent preferentially permeates through the membrane to form a solvent rich permeate and an oil rich retentate.The solvent rich permeate is recycled back into tower 20 via line 34 and the permeate is passed to stripper 38 via line 36.In stripper 38 the retentate is contacted with a stripping gas entering via line 40 which removes residual solvent from the retentate to form a solvent free dewaxed oil which is removed from the bottom of the stripper via line 42. The stripping gas containing the residual solvent leaves the top of the stipper via line 44. It is understood, of course, that the membrane unit will contain a number of membranes which may be arranged in paralleled and or series configurations. When solvent deoiling slack wax, any solvent useful for dewaxing waxy petroleum oils may be used. In most cases, it is preferred to use the same solvent for dissolving the foots oil that was used in the original dewaxing process. The foots oil containing slack wax may be obtained from dewaxing any waxy petroleum oil stock or distillate fraction thereof as previously enumerated. Referring to Figure 4, a solvent containing slack wax, at a temperature of about 0OF., is withdrawn from a lube oil wax filter not shown via line 10. The solvent containing slack wax stream contains foots oil having a melting point of about 70OF. and comprises about 25 LV liquid volume of oily wax and 75 LV of a 30 70 volume mixture of MEK MIBK. The solvent containing slack wax stream in line 10 is mixed with permeate solvent from line 24 in an amount of about one volume of permeate solvent per volume of solvent containing slack wax. The permeate solvent is a 30 70 volume mixture of MEK MIBK, at a temperature of about 700F., which is withdrawn and recycled from membrane unit 22. Alternatively, the solvent can be added after heat exchanger 30.The mixture of slack wax and permeate solvent is passed to heat exchanger 30 via line 12 wherein it is warmed up to a temperature of about 70OF. which dissolves the foots oil, but not the wax, to produce a slurry comprising solid particles of wax and a solution of foots oil. This slurry is passed to wax filter 14 via line 13 wherein the solid wax is separated from the foots oil solution.Filter 14 is a rotary drum filter wherein the solid wax is deposited on a rotating drum not shown in the form of a wax cake which is solvent washed on the drum. The wash solvent comprises a 30 70 volume mixture of MEK MIBK, at a temperature of about 70OF., which enters filter 14 via line 16. One volume of wash solvent is used for each three volumes of slurry entering the wax filter 14. The deoiled, washed wax is then removed from the filter via line 18. Approximately one volume of deoiled wax cake is produced for every six volumes of slurry entering the filter and the wax cake comprises approximately 30 volume wax and 70 volume solvent. In the wax filter the foots oil solution is separated from the deoiled wax as a foots oil filtrate. The wash solvent forms a wash filtrate.The foots oil and wash filtrates are combined in the filter and passed to membrane unit 22 via line 20. Membrane unit 22 contains a plurality of modified, semi permeable membrane made from regenerated cellulose which preferentially permeates therethrough solvent from the combined filtrate to form a permeate richer in solvent and a retentate leaner in solvent than the combined filtrate feed fed to the unit. In membrane unit 22, the combined filtrate contacts one side of said membranes, at a temperature of about 70OF. and under a differential pres sure across the membranes of about 400 psi. Each two volumes of combined filtrate entering the membrane unit produces one volume of permeate containing from about 1 3 volume of foots oil and one volume of retentate containing about 15 volume foots oil.The permeate is removed from the unit via line 24 and recycled back into the warm up deoiling process. The retentate may be sent to further processing to separate the solvent from the foots oil. The further processing may comprise membrane and or thermal separation means. It is to be understood that membrane unit 22 is intended to include at least one unit containing a plurality of said modified membranes arranged in parallel and or series configurations. A plurality of membrane units may be employed in the process of this invention.EXAMPLE 7 In this experiment the apparatus heretofore described was used along with a Spectrum Medical Industries regenerated cellulose membrane designated as Spectrapore 3500 having a molecular weight cut off MWCO of 3500 and a nominal thickness of 0.002 inches which was pretreated by soaking in water to remove the glycerine, followed by a sequential solvent permeation of methanol and MEK under a pressure of 400 psi at room temperature. Samples of the so treated membrane were then placed in the apparatus heretofore described. The apparatus was charged with a feed comprising a 5 LV solution of a foots oil, having a melting point of about 700F., in a 45 55 volume solution of MEK MIBK. The feed contacted the membrane under a pressure of 400 psig and at a temperature of 1220F. At 50 permeation, the permeate comprised a mixture of about 99 LVZ solvent and 1 LV foots oil.
