# Blowing agent compositions and their use in expanding rubbers and plastics.

## Abstract
A blowing agent composition comprising a azodicarbonamide b zinc oxide, zinc carbonate or a zinc salt of C₁ C₄ organic acid and c an aromatic sulfinic acid or a metal salt of an aromatic sulfinic acid wherein for each 100 parts by weight of a , b is .25 25 parts by weight and c is from 1 2000 parts by weight per 100 parts of b and the total of b c is from 2 25 parts by weight is disclosed. Also described are processes for expanding gas expand able rubber, and plastics by means of blowing agent compositions of the invention.
