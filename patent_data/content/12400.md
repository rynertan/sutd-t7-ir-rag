## Description
A PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR THERMODINAMICALLY DETERMINING THEELASTO PLASTIC LIMIT LOAD.This invention relates to a method of determining the limit of elasticity in metal structural materials, the associated apparatus used, and its use. Particularly, the invention aims to determine a parameter qualifying the elasto plastic properties of a material.In structure design, the goal is to specify the boundary between elastic and plastic behaviour in materials. Due to operative problems, which are solved by the present invention, the so called yield point is commonly referred to. The standard for specifying such parameter is based on stress deformationUNI characteristic curve 6 g and varies depending on the nature of the material. Two typical cases should be pointed out. I There is a sharp change in slope of the characteristics curve 6 in this case, the yield point coincides with the point of largest change in slope.II The slope of the characteristic curve continuously varies, tending to become zero at plastic zone in this case, said yield point is conventionally obtained as that load which corresponds to a permanent deformation of 0.2 of the initial test length. In such a case, a straight line is drawn parallel to the tangent at the origin of the curve , and passing through the point of the cordinates having a deformation 8 0.2 and allotting to load 6 0.2 intercepted by such a straight line on the curve 6 the significance of yielding point.Particularly, in this second case, which is the most common case, the standard appears to be artful. Moreover, due to the difficulty in specifying the direction of the tangent at the origin of the curve 6 , the slope of which continuously varies particularly in austenitic stainless steels, the inherent uncertainty in these tests may lead to the provision of structures which are stressed either too much or too little, since in a great deal of materials a thus defined yielding point is localized quite far away from the region exhibiting an elastic behaviour.This could influence costs and even safety in most serious cases. On the other hand, it is known that during tensile tests, variations occur in the specimen temperature, in addition to changes in load and deformation. Particularly, a study published in the name of D. Ronnpagel following the priority date of this application J. Phys. E Sci, Instrum., Vol. 12 1979 teaches the possibility of using such variations in temperature in order to quantitatively disting,Uish the thermic energy developed by mechanical deformation during the stationary plastic condition following the thermo elastic cooling. However, the problem was never dealt with to assure whether and to which extent said variations in temperature are in mutual relationship with the characteristics of elastoplastic transition.Particularly, but not exclusively referring to case II , it is the primary object of the apparatus according to the present patent application to univocally establish the load relating to the limit between small elastic deformations and plastic deformations,8 3. Thus, in design calculations, lower factors of safety than those commonly used can be allotted without undue risk, providing structures which are of higher safety as well.In the study of these facts, it was considered that when exposing a material to a stress, such a material would be subjected to a an initial cooling in elastic condition and b a subsequent heatinas soon as plastic condition are reached following said initial elastic condition.At isoentropic elastic condition the reduction in temperature which is substantially homogeneous both inside and in the surface, is due to the reduction in vibrational entropy which has to equalize the increase in configurational entropy associated with mechanical expansion.At plastic condition the increase in temperature which is also substantially homogeneous for small plastic deformations and in the absence of significant faults is due to the rise of micropasticity phenomena associated with the motion as a whole of structural micro faults point defects, dislocations .After extended and careful studies, it was found that, excepted for rare and anyhow rationally acceptable exclusions, just at the limit between the conditions conventionally classified as elastic and plastic conditions, the curve of the specimen surface temperature shows a minimum, beyond which at the beginning of the plastic condition, a sudden rise occurs.Therefore, at such a rise the limit is suitably localized between small deformations elastic condition and significant deformations plastic condition.The above specified object has been accomplished by providing to sense the variation in surface temperature of the specimen and to assume as characteristic value that corresponding to a sudden variation in temperature. An apparatus according to the present invention comprises a a temperature sensor b an electronic resistance tension transducer system c a registering system and d a unit for sensing the minimal temperature, to which said load is related.Such an apparatus cooperates with a per se known material testing machine which is usually provided with means for sensing strains and deformations.The invention will be more clearly understood with reference to an exemplary embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a device according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a schematic view of a material testing machine fitted with the apparatus according to the present invention Fig. 3 is a diagram showing the strain and temprature versus time andFig. 4 is a diagram of strain versus time and temperature.As shown in Fig. 2, the material testing machine comprises a stationary crosshead 5 and a movable crosshead 6, each of which are provided with gripping means 7 for a specimen 8.Reference numeral 9 designates the driving screws, whereas reference numeral 10 denotes the controlled motor and reduction gear. The strain is sensed by a loading cell 11 supplying the data to sampling oscilloscope 3 and drive console 12, further comprising a loading recorder. A standard material testing machine could comprise a sensor 13 for deformation which supplies the signals to a second electronic resistance voltage transducing system 14, the latter developing a diagram with the data derived from said loading cell 11. The elements 13 and 14 may be removed in the loading test according to the present invention, but could as well be maintained while not disturbing the measurements at all. The elements of the apparatus cooperating as a whole with the material testing machine are, as above mentioned, the following a temperature sensor 1.The thermosensitve element comprises a miniaturized type of bare bead, negative coefficient of temperature NTC thermistor having a maximum diameter of about 0.5 mm. The temperatureresistance characteristic curve of such sensors can be approximated by the relation R T a exp B T wherein a and B are constants and T is the temperature.The transducer is in thermal contact with the surface of the specimen to be mechanically stressed by a drop of silicone oil, affording a good electrical insulation and also a good heat conductivity. b an electronic resistance voltage transducing system.When the dependence of the thermistor resistance on temperature is known through the experimental calibration curve, the apparatus hereinafter described enables to follow the temporal evolution of the temperature for the stressed specimen, recording it continuously. For a thermodynamic determination of the limit of elasticity, a resolving power in the order of 10 C would suffice.This allows the use of a simple D.C. bridge method.Referring to Fig. 1, R T is the thermistor resistance R1 andR2 are two fixed resistances and R3 is a varying resistance, the value of which is adjusted so as to make zero the bridge output at temperature To, about which the small variations will be measured. The bridge diagonal is supplied at constant voltage E. As temperature T varies, at the terminals A andB of the other diagonal a voltage signal VB VA V T VA Vu is available which, once amplified, is recorded as measurements are being taken. c a recording system.It consists of a sampling oscilloscope 3 and a pen recorder XY designated at 4.In real time such an oscilloscope receives the signals from said loading cell 8 t and thermsistor T t when converted into digital form, such signals are stored in the oscilloscope memory. At the oscilloscope output, such signals are subjected to digital analogue reconversion. The analogical signals T and joing respectively in the recorder channels X and Y.The not strictly necessary use of the sampling oscilloscope allows of follow and record the pattern of the variables 6 and T as a function of time, as the latter variable cannot be otherwise included in recording X Y.When considering Fig. 2, the modalities of use can be readily deduced. It is only necessary to combine a conventional tensile test with a temperature measurement of high sensitivity, resolution and rapidity, and to record load and temperature by means of the apparatus above described.First, curves t and T t are provided, that is the curves for strain and temperature in function of time Fig.3 , then curve eS T is provided, that is the curve for the strain in function of the temperature Fig. 4 and the minimum of temperature trac. T t is sensed for traction tests, or the sudden variation comp. T t for compression tests on such a curve it can be clearly specified the reversal point of the temperature curve, with the yielding point made corresponding thereto. Where the definite sensing of temporal pattern of strain and temperature signals is of no insterest, by removing said sampling oscilloscope the strain6 in function of temperatureT can be directly recorded on recorder XV. Alternatively, it is also possible as a principle to replace said recorder XY with an electronic analogue digital conversion system supplying for the strain and temperature two series of associated numbers in such a case the system provides for automatically specifying the minimum temperature value, with which the corresponding strain value should be associated. Particularly, by suitable software the derivative could be calculated and the load could be specified as corresponding to the sudden variation in temperature.
