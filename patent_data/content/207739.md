# METHOD AND APPARATUS UTILIZING AGAR DIFFUSION TECHNIQUE FOR DETERMINING QUANTITATIVE DRUG CONCENTRATION PARAMETER

## Abstract
An apparatus for using the continuous gradient disk dif fusion technique to obtain quantitative minimum inhibitory concentrations and inhibitory quotients comprises an electro nic caliper operatively coupled to a microprocessor for feed ing thereto signals coding the diameters of bacteria growth inhibition zones measured by the caliper. In response to the signals, the microprocessor automatically calculates by means of a regression type analysis the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the drugs, as determinable based on a cor relation with results by a broth dilution test, with respect to the bacterium under study. The microprocessor also calculates, in response to the signals from the electronic caliper, inhibi tory quotients with respect to a plurality of different body fluids such as bile, blood and cortical spinal fluid. The appar atus may also be used to determine unknown concentrations of antimicrobial drugs by using the disk diffusion technique and a regression analysis.
