# Semiconductor switch.

## Abstract
A semiconductor switch comprises a PNPN switch 11, 21 including a semiconductor PNPN structure having at least three PN junctions, a first and a second transistor 12, 22 16, 26 and a discharging means 17, 18, Pc . The emitter and collector terminals of the first transistor 12, 22 are connected to one main terminal K and a region adjacent to the one main terminal K , correspondingly and respectively, of the PNPN switch. The emitter and col lector of the second transistor 16, 26 are connected to the other main terminal A of the PNPN switch and a base of the first transistor 12, 22 , correspondingly and respec tively, and the discharging means 17, 18, Pc connected between a base of the second transistor 16, 26 and a region of the PNPN switch which is adjacent to the other main terminal A thereof to allow discharging of charges stored in the base of the second transistor 16, 26 , where by capability of protection against dv dt effect of the PNPN switch may be improved and the semiconductor switch may be readily implemented in an IC structure and may respond to a rapid voltage change.
