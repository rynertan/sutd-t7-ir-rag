## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONCOMPOSITION CONTAINING A PHENYL BENZOIC ACID COMPOUNDAND ACETAMINOPHEN COMBINATION FOR THE TREATMENT OFPAIN AND INFLAMMATION AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THESAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel drug combination for more effective treatment of pain and in flammation. Particularly, the present invention is concerned with the combination of a a phenyl benzoic acid compound and b acetaminophen. Pain, along with erythema and edema, is one of the three major symptoms of acute inflammation. Further, it is known that pain, inflammation, and prostaglandins are interrelated. It is currently believed that prostaglandins PGs are released peripherally at a site of local inflammation, and act to sensitize pain receptors to the action of pain inducing mediators, whatever their origin.Not only the primary prostaglandins PGE2 and PGE2 , but the endoperoxide intermediates PGG2 and PGH2 as well, are involved. In fact, all of the oxygenation products resulting from the interaction of arachidonic acid AA with prostaglandin synthetase cyclo oxygenase must be considered potential pain inducing agents. Thus, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents NSAI have analgesic and anti inflammatory activity due to their ability to depress the synthesis of prostaglandins by acting on the cyclo oxygenase. It is also currently believed that a destructive free radical oxidant released in the conversion of PGG2 toPGH2 plays a causal role in inflammatory processes, as well as in pain. The phenyl benzoic acid compounds of the drug combination of the present invention are gooa prostaglandin cyclo oxygenase inhibitors, and have a slight ability to neutralize the destructive oxidant as well.Acetaminophen, on the other hand, while it has no significant cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, is a potent scavenger of the oxidative radical. Surprisingly, the novel drug combination of the present invention possesses improved analgesia in the form of both more rapid onset of action, as well as in prolonged action. Reference is made to the following for a more detailed discussion of the above principles Kuehle andEgan, Prostaglandins and Related Mediators in Pain ,XIV Congress of Rheumatology, San Francisco, California,June 29, 1977 and Kuehl et al. Biochemical Aspects ofProstaglandins and Thromboxanes, Academic Press, pp. 5574 1977 . Brief Description of the Prior Art The phenyl benzoic acid compounds employed in the present invention are known analgesic and anti inflammatory compounds. See U.S. Patent Nos. 3,674,870 and 3,714,226. And, acetaminophen is a known analgesic agent.However, the combination is novel and the more effective treatment of pain and inflammation obtained therewith was wholly unexpected. Acetaminophen esters of phenyl benzoic acid compounds, useful as analgesic and anti inflammatory agents, are also known. See U.S. Patent No. 3,892,769.However, these esters represent 1 1 molar ratios of the phenyl benzoic acid and acetaminophen components of the basic molecule whereas, in the physical mixture combination of the present invention, the acetaminophen is re wired to be present in several times the amount of the phenyl benzoic acid compound employed. A eutectic mixture consisting of 63 aspirin and 37 acetaminophen is described in Japanese Patent No.18,232 and a simple mixture of 10 grains of aspirin and 10 grains of acetaminophen is described in U.S. Patent No.4,049,803. While these combinations claim to produce increased blood levels of aspirin in the blood, they do not suggest the novel drug combination of the present invention.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there is provided a novel drug combination for more effective treatment of pain and inflammation comprising a from 0.5 to 50.0 by weight of a phenyl benzoic acid compound, and b from 50.0 to 99.5 by weight of acetaminophen. Preferably, from 6.0 to 50.0 by weight of the phenyl benzoic acid compound and from 50.0 to 94.0 by weight of the acetaminophen are employed. The phenyl benzoic acid compounds utilized in the novel drug combination of the present invention are selected from compounds of the general formula EMI4.1 wherein X 1 5 is halo, such as fluoro or chloro, but especially fluoro X being on one or more of the phenyl carbon atoms R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, phenoxy diloweralkylamino such as dimethylamine , do lower alkylamino loweralkoxy such as diethylaminoethoxy R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkanoyl such as acetyl, propionyl and butyryl andR3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl.Also included are the pharmaceutically non toxic salts of the acids of the compounds of Formula I such as the ammonium, alkali metal such as sodium or potassium alkaline earth metals such as calcium, barium or magnesium amine aluminum iron choline glucosamine S methyl methonine salts, piperazine, diloweralkylamino lower alkanol, chloroquine and hydroxy chloroguine the anhydride of said acids, the mixed anhydrides of said acids and 2 acetoxy benzoic acid. Especially preferred phenyl benzoic acid compounds are those wherein R1 is hydroxy, R2 is hydrogen or acetyl, R3 is hydrogen, and X is fluoro,X being on any position of the phenyl moiety when X is one fluoro group, but particularly on the 4 position and where X represents two fluoro groups, particularly on the 2 and 4 positions. Representative phenyl benzoic acid compounds are as follows 2 hydroxy 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoic acid 2 acetoxy S 21 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoic acid 2 hydroxy 5 2 fluorophenyl benzoic acid 2 hydroxy 5 4 fluorophenyl benzoic acid 2 hydroxy 5 3 fluorophenyl benzoic acid 2 hydroxy 5 pentafluorophenyl benzoic acid 2 hydroxy 3 methyl 5 2t4w difluorophenyl benzOic acid 2 hydroxy 5 2 chloro 4 fluorophenyl benzoic acid N,N dimethyl 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl salicylamide B diethylaminoethyl S 2 ,4 difluorophenyl salicylate phenyl 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl salicylate aluminum 2 acetoxy 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoate salt aluminum 2 hydroxy 5 2 ,41 difluorophenyl benzoate salt choline 2 acetoxy 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoate salt choline 2 hydroxy 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoate salt sodium 2 acetoxy 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoate salt sodium 2 hydroxy 5 2 , 4 difluorophenyl benzoate salt 2 acetoxy 5 pentafluorophenyl benzoic acid Q diethylaminoethyl 2 hydroxy 5 2 ,4 difluorophenyl benzoate edietylarr,inoethyl 2 acetoxy 5 2 ,4 benzoate. Acetaminophen is represented by the following formula EMI6.1 The treatment of pain and inflammation in accordance with the method of the present invention is accomplished by orally administering to patients in need of such treatment a composition having as its active ingredient a mixture of from 0.5 to 50.0 by weight of a compound of Formula I, particularly the especially preferred compounds, and from 50.0 to 99.5 by weight of the compound of Formula II, in a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably in tablet or capsule form. The non toxic pharmaceutical carrier may be for example, either a solid or a liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, corn starch, gelatin, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, terra alba, sucrose, agar, pec tin, cab o sil, and acacia. Exemplary of liquid carriers are peanut oil, olive oil, sesame oil and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax. Several pharmaceutical forms of the therapeuti cally useful compositions can be used. For example, if a solid carrier is used, the compositions may take the form of tablets, capsules, powders, troches or lozenges, prepared by standard pharmaceutical techniques. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a soft gelatin capsule, a syrup or a liquid supsension. The active compounds of Formulas I and II and of the compositions of this invention are present in an amount sufficient to treat pain and inflammation, that is to reduce pain and inflammation. Advantageously, the composition will contain the active ingredient, namely, the compounds of Formulas I and II in an amount of from about 1 mg. to 140 mg. per kg. body weight per day 50 mg. to 10 g. per patient per day , preferably from about 2 mg. to 70 mg. per kg. body weight per day 100 mg. to 5 g. per patient per day . The method of treatment of this invention comprises internally administering to a patient animal or human , compounds of Formulas I and II, particularly including an especially preferred compound of Formula I admixed with a non toxic pharmaceutical carrier such as exemplified above. The mixture of the compounds of FormulasI and II will be present in an amount of from 1 mg. vto 140 mg. kg. body weight per day, preferably from about 2 mg.to about 70 mg. per kilogram body weight per day and especially from 4 mg. to 10 mg. kg. body weight per day. The most rapid and effective anti inflammatory effect is obtained from oral administration of a daily dosage of from about 4 to 10 mg. kg. day. It should be understood, however, that although preferred dosage ranges are given, the dose level for any particular patient depends upon the activity of the specific compound employed. Also many other factors that modify the actions of drugs will be taken into account by those skilled in the art in the therapeutic use of medicinal agents, particularly those of Formulas I and II, for example, age, body weight, sex, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, reaction sensitivities and severity of the particular disease. The more effective treatment of pain achieved with the novel drug combination of the present invention was evaluated in a bioassay designed to detect the analgesic activity of the combination. Since analgesic tests using intact animals are not sensitive enough to detect the analgesic activity of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory compounds, the analgesic bioassay employed utilized inflammatory sensitization procedures, specifically adjuvant arthritis. Adjuvant arthritis induced in rats, the animals used in the bioassay, resembles rheumatoid arthritis in man with respect to the manifestation of inflammation and hyperalgesia. When the affected joints of rats with adjuvant arthritis are subjected to a gentle manipulation, preferably by extending the joint, the rats respond by squeaking, which is a definite and reproducible sign of algesia.The ability of the tested compounds to suppress this squeaking response was an accurate measure of the analgesic activity of the tested compounds.Further, the anti inflammatory activity of the tested compounds played Qnly a minor role in the joint extension analgesic activity of the compounds, because the adjuvant arthritis lesions were relatively tolerant to the antiinflammatory action, and because the analgesic activity of the compounds could be demonstrated at very low doses. In accordance with the adjuvant arthritis bioassay used to evaluate the analgesic activity of the combinations of compounds of the present invention, young adult Sprague Dawley rats of either sex are rendered hyperalgesic by injection of dessicated Mycobacteriumbutyricum suspended in light mineral oil Freund s adjuvant .The mycobacteria are ground in a mortar, suspended in the oil, and sterilized in an autoclave. Each animal receives 0.5 mg of the bacteria in 0.1 ml of oil, injected subcutaneously through a 21 gauge needle into the distal third of the tail. The animals can subsequently be used in two ways for testing the analgesic action of drugs. The day after the injection of adjuvant, the tail is found to be sensitive to touch. Approximately 16 hours after the injection, the experimenter tests the animals for the presence of hyperalgesia. This is done by holding the animal in one hand. With the thumb and forefinger of the other hand, the observer applies gentle pressure to the tail about 2.5 cm proximal to the point where the needle has been inserted.This gentle pressure is repeated at 5 sec intervals. If the rat endures five such gentle presses without emitting more than one squeak , analgesia is considered to be present and a score of is assigned. Two or more squeaks earns a rating of 0, or no analgesia. Before being assigned to an experiment, animals are screened and only those with the 0 rating are used. The hyperalgesic animals are assigned randomly to drug treatments and one of the treatments is always the vehicle without the drug placebo group . When testing the animals, the observer does not know which treatment an individual animal has received. Presence or absence of analgesia is determined at one hour intervals for a total of six 6 hours after administration of the drug and one can calculate the ED50, that is the dose required to produce analgesia in one half of the animals. This entire procedure may be referred to as tail pinch technique. Alternatively, an apparatus for applying pressure to the tail may be employed and the squeak threshold determined before and after drug. The adjuvant injected animals, if left undis turbed, develop severe arthritis which becomes especially manifest in about two weeks. These rats also exhibit hyperalgesia and if the hind feet are gently manipulated, a squeak response is readily elicited in a manner similar to that described above by pinching the tail the day after adjuvant injection. This foot bend technique yields drug responses essentially identical with those obtained by the tail pinch procedure. The adjuvant arthritis analgesic bioassay described above correlates with analgesic activity in humans, since compounds known to be clinically active, including indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ibufenac, and aspirin, give positive, dose dependent, reproducible results in this assay. For a further description of this bioassay and its significance, reference is made to Kuzuma and Kawai, Evaluation of Analgesic Agents in Rats with AdjuvantArthritis , Chem. Pharm. Bull., 23 6 1184 1191 1975 . The data obtained from the adjuvant arthritis analgesic bioassay is summarized in the tables of values below. TABLE I.

FIG. 1 is a graph of the analgesia data for 50 mg. kg. of acetaminophen and 2 mg. kg. of diflunisal, as well as a mixture of these. These doses are relatively small doses. FIG. 2 is a graph of the analgesia data for relatively moderate doses, i.e., for 200 mg. kg. of aceta minophen and 8 mg. kg. of diflunisal, as well as a mixture of these. The data above, and particularly the graphs of that data, clearly show the improved analgesia obtained with the combination of phenyl benzoic acid compounds and acetaminophen, over either separate component alone. That improved analgesia occurs in the form of both more rapid onset of action, as well as in prolonged action. Also, the improved analgesia occurs over basically the entire range of proportionate amounts of the phenyl benzoic acid compound and acetaminophen in the combination. The improved analgesia is particularly clear where the combination of phenyl benzoic acid compound and acetaminophen provides analgesic activity at dose levels where either one or both of the separate components alone, at the same dose level, provides no analgesic activity at all.Data showing this particular aspect of the improved analgesia obtained with the novel drug combination of the present invention is summarized in the table below, and is taken from the data set out in TABLE I above TABLE II.
