## Description
The present invention relates to terpolymers derived from lactams and a reactive elastomeric block co oligomer comonomer. The present invention includes methods to make the terpolymers. The anionic polymerization of lactams such as caprolactam is known to proceed through the use of two solutions, as for example in US A 3017391. The first solution contains molten caprolactam in which is dissolved an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal containing material which, in situ, causes the formation of a caprolactamyl anion. The active catalyst may thus be lithium or sodium caprolactam or may be bromomagnesium caprolactam or similar ionic compounds. The second solution contains molten caprolactam in which is dissolved a co catalyst, which in the above patent may be an acyl biscaprolactam such as terephthaloyl bis caprolactam . Mixing solutions under appropriate temperature conditions causes polymerization to form a polyamide having at some intermediate point in the chain a terephthaloyl moiety between amine ends of polyamide chains, having caprolactamoyl or carboxy end groups and, in most instances, some degree of branching such as at the nitrogen of an amide ligand. Molded parts can be prepared by reaction injection molding. A reactive mixture containing caprolactam or similar lactam monomers is injected into a mold where the reaction takes place. While such processes may proceed through anionic polymerization using similar catalysts and co catalysts to those described above, it is generally desired to achieve faster cycle times at higher temperatures and to obtain parts with modified properties, and especially increased impact strength, compared to those prepared by the processes described above. US A 3366608 discloses polymerizing caprolactam in the presence of an alkylene catalyst, N,N diacyl biscaprolactam and a polyamine containing two or more primary or secondary amine groups per molecule, or a polyol containing two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule. Suitable polyols are indicated to include diethylene glycol , trimethylol propane, and polyglycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. US A 3862262, 3993709, 3944629, 4034015 and 4487920 disclose many useful polyols which can be polymerized with caprolactam to form lactam polyol containing polymers.

The Z hydrocarbon, substituted hydrocarbon and acylated hydrocarbon groups can be of any size even polymeric, generally limited to about six carbon atoms, said groups being preferably alkylene, arylene and mixtures thereof. Preferred are aliphatic groups such as methylene, ethylene and propylene. Other suitable Z groups include phenylene, chlorophenylene, tolylene, isobutylene, isopropylene, ethylcarbonyl, propylcarbonyl, ethysulfonyl, and propylthiocarbonyl. The Z hydrocarbon can be fluorinated. Useful polyols include polymeric polyols such as polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, polyoxypropylene diols and triols, castor oils, and polyester glycols, and a large number of compounds containing substituents other than hydroxy groups such as 2,4 dichlorobutylene glycol and 2,2 4,4 bis chlorohydroxyphenyl ether. The molecular weight of the polyol can be any amount. Commercially available polymeric polyol compounds have molecular weights from 200 to 5,000, but polymers with molecular weights outside that range are also useful in the practice of the instant invention. The block co oligomer preferably has a number average molecular weight of from 2,000 to 10,000. The weight ratio of blocks of the carboxylic acid derived material in the block comonomer to the polyol , amine terminated polyether, or epoxy terminated polyether derived material is greater than one and preferably from 1.5 to 10, and more preferably from 1.5 to 4. The most preferred block co oligomers are derived from the esterification of dicarboxylic acids of polybutadiene, 1,2 polybutadiene, hydrogenated 1,2 polybutadiene, chlorinated polybutadiene, polysiloxane and polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 500 to 2,500. The block co oligomer has been found to be useful to form an improved terpolymer of the type containing lactam monomers at least one material selected from the polyol, amine terminated polyether, and epoxy terminated polyether, and a coupling co catalyst wherein the improvement is the use of the above described block co oligomer. The copolymer is formed using a lactam polymerization catalyst. The lactam used in the present invention is preferably a cyclic lactam having the formula with q being an integer of 3 12. The lactam monomer and polyol, amine, or epoxy terminated polyether, used in the polymerization have been described above. The coupling co catalyst used can be any coupling co catalyst known for use in the anionic polymerization of lactams. Included in useful catalyst coupling agents are polyacyl compounds, polycarbamoyl compounds, triazine compounds, and isocyanates. Useful polyacyl compounds are discussed in US A 4031164. Polyacyl components in the copolymer can have the following structure The R groups. Most preferred among the above groups is the carbonyl group. Values for the integer y have a direct relationship to the thermoplasticity of the copolymer. If the integer y is greater than one, the linkage will be a higher polyacyl group. The higher the value of y, the finished polymer will be more highly crosslinked. Values for y can be as high as six or eight, but more preferably do not exceed two or three. Formula 13 sets forth the polyacyl lactams useful herein. The R Examples include terephthaloyl bis caprolactam, adipoyl bis caprolactam malonyl bis pyrrolidinone succinoyl bispyrrolidinone glutaroyl bis piperidone glutaconoyl bis piperidone 2 ethyl 2 phenyl plutaroyl bis valerolactam 2,3 diethylsuccinoyl bis caprolactam pimeloyl bis capryllactam sebacoyl bis caprolactam phthaloyl bis piperidone isophthaloyl bis dodecanolactam trimesoyltris caprolactam 1,3,5 benzene tricarbonyl tril caprolactam 1,2,3,5 benzenetetracarbonyltetrakis caprolactam 1,2,3,4 naphthalenetetracarbonyltetrakis piperidone and 1,4 cyclohexanedicarbonyl bis caprolactam 1,3 benzene disulfonyl caprolactam 3 sulfonyl caprolactam benzoyl caprolactam phosphoryl tris caprolactam benzene phosphoryl bis caprolactam and dithioterephthaloyl bis caprolactam. The amount of polyacyl lactam useful in the preparation of the terpolymers of this invention depends upon the quantities of lactam and block comonomer being used. For preferred polymerizations, it is desirable that the polyacyl lactam be present in an amount from 100 to 500, preferably from 100 to 200, equivalent percent of the polyol. If the polyacyl lactam is present in an amount less than a molecular equivalent amount based on the block comonomer polyol prepolymer formation occurs, but the subsequent lactam polymerization is very slow. In those preferred polymerization systems where the polyacyl lactam concentration exceeds the amount stiochiometrically equivalent to the block comonomer, the excess can be from 0.01 to 30 or more mole percent of the lactam monomer. A preferred range is from 0.1 to 10 mole percent of the lactam monomer, and more preferably from 0.2 to 5 mole percent of the lactam monomer. The coupling co catalyst can also include triazines as disclosed in US A 4487920. The triazine co catalyst coupling agent can be selected from the group consisting of and mixtures thereof wherein R The preferred group of triazine co catalyst coupling agents are those of formula 14 having two reactive substituents R When R Preferred R substituents are chloro, bromo, caprolactamyl and phenoxy, with chloro and caprolactamyl being most preferred. The non reactive substituent R The coupling co catalyst can also be a polyisocyanate preferably a diisocyanate having the formula O C N R Alternately, a polycarbamoyl group can be used as the coupling co catalysts. This compound has the general formula where r is from 2 to 6, and The lactam polymerization catalyst useful herein includes the class of compounds commonly recognized as suitable basic catalysts for the anhydrous polymerization of lactams. In general, all alkali or alkaline earth metals are effective catalysts either in the metallic form or in the form of hydrides, halohydrides, alkylhalides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, and the like. The catalyst can be selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkali metal hydrides, alkyl alkaline earth monohalides and aryl alkaline earth monohalides or a lactam salt of the formula where M is an alkali metal cation or alkaline earth metal monohalide. Also useful are a number of organometallic compounds of the metals mentioned above such as metal alkyls, metal phenyls, metal amides, and the like. Examples include sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, lithium oxide, ethyl magnesium bromide, calcium fluorohydride, strontium carbonate, barium hydroxide, methyl sodium butyl lithium, potassium phenyl, diphenyl barium, sodium amide and magnesium diethyl. All of the foregoing compounds react with the lactam monomer to form the metal lactam, which is the active catalytic agent in the lactam polymerization mechanism. The metal lactam catalyst can therefore be formed in situ by reaction of one of the foregoing metal or metal compounds with lactam monomer in the polymerization medium or by prior reaction of the metal or metal compound with a stoichiometric quantity of lactam monomer. Examples of metal lactam catalysts include sodium caprolactam, magnesium caprolactam, bromomagnesium pyrrolidinone, chlorocalcium caprolactam and the like. Catalyst concentrations can range from a fraction of one mole percent to 10 or more mole percent of the lactam monomer to be polymerized with the preferred catalyst concentration being from .1 to 10, more preferably .5 to 5 mole percent based on the lactam. The terpolymer of the present invention is a block copolymer comprising the aforementioned components having a number of different structures depending upon the process conditions and the relative proportions of ingredients used in the reaction system. Polymers can be prepared having relatively small segments of lactam units joined to similarly short segments of the reactive block cooligomer units through the coupling co catalyst linkage described above. Or large segments of one polymeric component can be combined with a larger number of comparatively small segments of another polymeric unit, which small segments are joined to one another through the coupling cocatalyst linkage as well as to the other type of polymeric component. Or segments of varying sizes of both the lactam and the block co oligomer polymeric units can be combined through the coupling co catalyst components to form a highly random terpolymer. Another form of terpolymer within the scope of this invention are block terpolymers, where moderately large size blocks or segments of the lactam and reactive block oligomer polymeric units are positioned alternately in the polymer chain and joined through the co catalyst group described above. Following is a general formula 16 illustrating the terpolymer of the present invention. where The types of co catalyst lactam block co oligomer linkages and reaction mechanisms are of the type expected depending upon the reactive polyether or polysulfide. Postulated reaction mechanisms, and linkages are summarized in US A 4031164 and 4487920. While the applicants do not wish to be tied to a particular theory of reaction mechanism, following is summary of typical linkages which can be expected in the copolymer of formula 15 . The terminal linkages are expected to be ethyl lactams. Where the co catalyst is an acyl group, linkage to a hydroxy terminated co oligomer is an ester and linkage to an amine terminated co oligomer is an amide The acyl lactam linkage is an amide. Where the co catalyst is an isocyanate, the linkage to a hydroxy terminated co oligomer is an amide, the linkage to an amine terminated co oligomer is a urea The isocyanate carbamoyl linkage to the lactam is a urea. The triazine linkages which are expected are of the type disclosed in US A 4487920. In general, there is from .5 to 5 weight percent based on the weight of the total terpolymer of the moiety contributed by the coupling co catalyst. There is from 10 to 90 percent of the lactam moiety and from 5 to 90 percent of the block co oligomer moiety. More preferably there is from 10 to 50 percent of the block co oligomer moiety and most preferably there is only from 5 to 20 percent of the block co oligomer moiety. Correspondingly, there is preferably from 50 to 95 percent of the lactam moiety and most preferably from 70 to 90 percent of the lactam moiety. The lactam, block co oligomer, co catalyst coupling compound terpolymer has many uses as indicated in the cited patents. The preferred use of the terpolymer is to reaction injection mold articles. As will be seen from the following Examples, the use of the block co oligomer imparts improved impact resistance with reduced moisture absorption to a composition formed using the lactam block co oligomer terpolymers of the present invention. Copolymers containing moieties such as polyether polyols, lactam and co catalyst in copolymers are known as indicated in the cited references. Impact resistance has improved but a fast rate of moisture absorption with such copolymers continues to be a problem. When moisture is absorbed the dimensions of the final product can change. Therefore, when the final product is exposed to water or highly humid conditions, more than 2 percent moisture is absorbed and as much as 10 percent by weight percent moisture is absorbed resulting in greater than 2 percent dimensional changes after immersion in water for 20 days has been measured. A difficulty found when using polybutadiene in the form of polybutadiene diol, for example, has been that this type of material has poor compatibility with polycaprolactam. As a result, there is a tendency for the reaction to proceed initially but as the caprolactam polymerizes the compatibility becomes poorer and caprolactam homopolymer forms while the polybutadiene diol remains relatively unreactive and actually phase separates. This results in poor tensile and impact properties. According to the present invention, the terpolymer has as little as 0.20 percent dimensional change after 20 days of immersion in water. The dimensional stability is particularly important when the composition is used to form electrical parts and sheet like parts such as automobile fenders and the like. The use of the block co oligomer of the present invention has been found to result in improved impact resistance resulting from the rubbery segment while at the same time having improved moisture pickup resistance thereby enabling parts made from the copolymer to have improved dimensional stability. Where the rubbery segment is reacted with a polyol, amine, or epoxy terminated polyether, it results in the co oligomer which forms improved compatability with lactams such as polycaprolactam. The co oligomer, such as polyetherpolybutadiene block co oligomers reacts to conversion levels of greater than 80 and preferably 90 to 100 under conditions of the anionic polymerization of lactams. The co oligomers used in the invention are the reaction products of a polycarboxylic acid of the type having formulas 4 , 5 and 6 and the polyol, or amine or epoxy terminated polyether of the type having formulas 8 , 9 and 10 . The process is preferably conducted under a vacuum without the necessity of using a solvent. The vacuum is approximately 1 to 150 mm Hg 0.13 to 20 KPa , preferably 1 to 50 mm Hg 0.13 to 6.7 KPa and most preferably 1 to 10 mm Hg 0.13 to 1.3 KPa of mercury. The reaction is typically conducted at from 100 to 180, preferably from 130 to 180 and most preferably 140 to 165 C. The reaction should be conducted at a high enough temperature so that the caprolactam and the polyol or amine or epoxy terminated polyether are liquid. The reaction may be conducted continuously or batch with the batch type reaction being most preferred. Typically in a reaction, the ratio of the polycarboxylic acid to polyol or amine or epoxy terminated polyethers can be varied to form the desired co oligomer composition. The reaction is conducted until it is preferably 50 completed, more preferably 75 and most preferably greater or equal to 85 completed. The completion of reaction is measured as based on the percentage of acid groups esterified by carboxyl titration. An inert gas such as nitrogen or argon can be used above the reacting mixture to promote stirring. Other known ways to stir the reaction such as using the stirred reactor can be used. The preferred class of catalysts are alkyl titanates, and alkyl and aryl sulfonic acids. Preferred catalysts included tetra o butyl titanate, tetra n butyl titanate, and tetra propyl titanate, methane sulfonic acid and paratoluene sulfonic acids. This process results in a block co oligomer which can be used to form the above described lactam block co oligomer terpolymers. Polymerization temperatures can vary from the melting point of the lactam or less up to the melting point of the resultant terpolymer or more. Depending upon the particular ingredients being used, this can encompass a range from 70 to 230 C. Preferred polymerization temperatures are from 90 to 190 C, and more preferably from 120 C to 180 C for caprolactam terpolymers. Even more preferred is a polymerization where the temperature is increased during the polymerization from an initial temperature of from 70 to 100 C at the beginning of the polymerization to a final temperature of 150 to 180 C. Such a technique produces a rapid polymerization to a terpolymer having high strength and modulus. Times required for complete polymerization will vary considerably depending upon polymerization temperatures and the specific ingredients used in the polymerization system. Total polymerization time can be as little as 30 seconds or less, preferably from 1 to 10 minutes, and can be extended to any duration up to several days or more. Generally, polymerization times of from 1 to 10 minutes are preferred for most polymerization systems. In embodiments of the present invention, amine terminated ethers can be used in place of hydroxy terminated ethers. Where this is the case, the amine terminated ethers can be polyamines containing two or more primary or secondary amine groups per molecule. It has been found that amine terminated groups react most readily when isocyanate type coupling co catalysts are used. Alternately, other coupling co catalysts can be used but an initial reacting step to react them with acyl type coupling co catalysts may be required. The lactam and block co oligomer can be present in any relative proportions ranging up to 99 parts of either component to 1 part of the other. Preferred ratios of the two polymer forming materials depend upon the end use to which the finished polymer is to be put. For end use applications requiring strong rigid materials, the lactam content of the polymerizable medium should be relatively high such as 60 to 90 or more lactam. For other applications where elastomeric properties such as high elongation or where water absorption is tolerable or desirable, the relative proportions of the two monomers can be reversed so that the polymerizable medium will contain 60 or 80 or 90 or more of the block comonomer compound. Terpolymers containing greater quantities of lactam than block comonomer are preferred for a great many uses because of the advantageous combinations of properties achieved by such polymers. In addition to the three principal monomeric constituents which together produce the terpolymers of this invention, other polymerizable monomers can also be used to prepare polymers having four or more polymerizable constituents. Vinyl compounds and other monomers could be chosen which could be polymerized directly into a linear polymer chain. The quantity of such additional monomers could be very large even as great as 50 or more of the total polymerizable constituents but preferably is limited to quantities of 25 or less of the total monomer content. Several examples are set forth below to illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of carrying it out. However, the invention should not be considered as being limited to the details thereof. All parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Mn is number average molecular weight and Mw is weight average molecular weight. In the following Examples 1 to 13, block co oligomers have been produced.

The lactam block terpolymers described in this invention were obtained by fast, anionic copolymerization of the reactive, elastomeric, block co oligomers of Examples 1 13, with caprolactam employing bromomagnesium caprolactam as catalyst and terephthaloyl bis caprolactam as co catalyst coupling agent. The polymerizations were conducted via a reaction injection molding process RIM using a commercial, high temperature 2 stream RIM machine Battenfeld . The equipment used in this invention was a modified Battenfeld RIM machine consisting of a high temperature mixer dispenser unit with two 10 gallon 31.5 litre stainless steel tanks. The two material streams are calculated by means of hydraulically driven lance cylinders through the mixing head in a high pressure circulation loop. The mixer dispersing unit operates as a pulse function because of the lance cylinders. The 10 gal 31.5 litres mixing tanks A and B are oil heated with the remainder of the machine electrical heating. All of the machine in contact with the material streams is stainless steel with the exceptions of the steel mixing head, the chrome plated lance cylinders and the TEFLON lined flexible hoses. The machine is complete with agitators, pressure transducers, thermocouples throughout the machine, and entry ports for addition of materials or application of vacuum or pressure. Shot size is limited by the size of the lance cylinders. This machine is capable of making an 11 lb 5 Kg unfilled part of a 15 lb 6.8 Kg filled 25 part. Fill time is limited by the cylinder speed and material line diameters. Minimum fill time is about 2 seconds lb 4.4 sec Kg on this machine. The mixing head operates as both part of the circulation loop and the zone of mixing of the two streams. Upon realigning the plates in the mixing head and retracting a cleanout rod, by activating two hydraulic cylinders, the RIM machine goes from circulation to injection mode. The two material streams are mixed under pressure and shot into a mold. Mixing pressure is controlled by changing the minimum orifice size in the mixing head via a pair of adjustable conical impingement screws. Controls of the Battenfeld RIM machine consist of a number of temperature, pressure and flow control readouts, including 9 temperature control zones on each side and adjustable calibrated flow controls. Microprocessor controlled programming determines the event sequencing on the machine. The clamp used to hold the mold is a Battenfeld WK 60 with 20 tons 18.14 tonne clamping pressure overall. The platens are 24 x 24 610 x 610 mm with 90 tilt and booking capabilities. This Example illustrates the preparation of lactam block copolymer molded parts directly from the reaction injection molding process. Both A B tanks of the RIM machine as well as the circulating lines were preheated to 100 C. Tank A was charged with 40 lbs 18.2 Kg of dry caprolactam molten , and 10 lbs 4.5 Kg of 24 bromomagnesium caprolactam concentrates in caprolactam CMB , added as a granular solid with good stirring under argon. The concentrate was prepared by reaction of ethyl magnesium bromide and caprolactam, degassing and flating it as a solid. The contents of A tank were stirred to dissolve the catalyst and then circulated through the machine while degassing continuously under vacuum 30 100 mm Hg 4 to 13.3 KPa for 2 hours. The B tank was charged with 40 lbs 18.2 Kg of molten caprolactam, 2.67 lbs 1.2 Kg of terephthaloyl biscaprolactam TBC and 10.7 lbs 4.9 Kg of the block co oligomer of Example 1. The contents were stirred at 100 C under argon until complete solution occurred while degassing under vacuum for 30 minutes. The process operated with a shot at a mix ratio of 1 1, throughput rate of 14 lbs min 6.4 Kg min of each stream, mixing pressure of 300 psi 2168 KPa , and fill time of 5 seconds, into a preheated 160 C mold. The mold was a flat plaque of 2 x 2 x 1 8 610 x 610 x 3.2 mm dimensions. The cure was typically 60 seconds and the part was demolded within 2 minutes. The properties are listed in Table 2. This composition consisted of 10 block cooligomer content, 87.6 caprolactam, and 2.4 co catalyst. The above procedure of Example 14 a was similarly followed with the following material changes. The previous Example was repeated with the following A B tank charges to obtain a copolymer containing 12.5 block co oligomer units. The previous Example was repeated with the following A B tank charges to obtain a copolymer having 15 block co oligomer units. The results of Examples 14 a d are summarized in Table 2. The copolymer formed contains the indicated amount of co oligomer with the balance being polycaprolactam. Physical properties were tested according to the following procedures Tensile Strength, ASTM D 638 Flexural Properties, ASTM D 790 Notched Izod, ASTM D 356A and Heat Sag, ASTM D 3769. Dimensional Growth was measured based on dimensional change upon immersion for 20 days in water at 25 C for 1 8 inch 3.2 mm thick specimen. Dynamic modulus was measured according to the procedure set forth in Murayama, Material Science Monographs, 1, This Example is similar to Example 14 a except that block co oligomers from Example 8 were used. All other components are identical. The final terpolymer of this composition contained 7.5 of the co oligomer of Example 8 . Examples 15 b and c contained 12.5 and 15 of the block co oligomer of Example 8 respectively. The properties are listed in Table 3. In Example 15, the terpolymer formed contains the indicated amount of co oligomer and the balance is substantially polycaprolactam. Example 14 was repeated with different block cooligomers as shown in Table 4. Several examples were run with conventional polyether diols such as Poly G 5528 Olin a reactive polypropylene oxide diol of molecular weight 4,000, and hydroxy terminated poly butadiene co acrylonitrile Hycar HTBN as well as hydroxy terminated polybutadiene from Arco Poly BD . All these examples and their properties are listed in Table 5. Comparatives 1 and 2 used Olin s Poly G 5528. Comparative 3 used Hycar HTBN. Comparative 4 used Arco Poly BD. A physical mixture of B.F. Goodrich s Hycar HTB 2000 x 162 and Olin s Poly G 55 112 was used for this experiment. Hycar HTB 2000 x 162 is a hydroxy terminated polybutadiene of about the same molecular weight Mn 4,500 as the CTB used in the block co oligomer synthesis. The weight ratio of HTB and Poly G 55 112 in the physical mixture was kept at 2 1 about the same as the ratio of polybutadiene and polyether segments in block co oligomers of Example 1. The polymerization charge contained on the catalyst side 2.4 CMB, and on the co catalyst side 2.6 TBC when the polyol mixture was 10 and 2.8 TBC when in the polyol content 15 . Phase separation of the HTB was observed under an optical microscope.
