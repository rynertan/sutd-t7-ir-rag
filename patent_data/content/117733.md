# ERROR DETECTION CIRCUITRY FOR DIGITAL SYSTEMS

## Abstract
Circuitry for detecting errors in a digital bit stream com prising a succession of data blocks and wherein each block in corporates a parity check P . At an error monitoring location e.g. 100 , a bistable device e.g. 103 toggles in response to either a logical 1 or 0 in the bit stream. The output of the bistable device is sampled at a submultiple of the bit rate and compared with a predetermined criterion to detect bit errors.
