## Description
The present invention relates to a detergent composition for the hair and skin and, more specifically, to a detergent composition which is essentially non irritating and capable of maintaining the skin in a smoother and tender condition. The mechanism of skin cleaning is well known and has been largely studied this problem has been always faced by using chemical compounds having specific detergent action. Since a detergent action, more or less strong but nevertheless specific, is accompanied by not negligible side effects, such as for instance some dryness of the skin, combined with phenomena like chaps, roughness, and blushing, and since these problems have not only an aesthetic consequence but also involve more generally the natural defences of the skin, a great number of attempts have been proposed and carried out throughout the years, essentially consisting in the provision of complex formulations the latter, besides the component having specific detergent action contain other ingredients, such as for example emollient substances capable or reducing the skin roughness as induced by the cleaning. As a typical example, the lanoline and other animal, vegetal or mineral oils can be cited, which in definitely modest percentages are present in the detergent compositions, both solid and liquid. Another common expedient is that of adjusting the pH of the cleaning composition by bringing it towards the neutrality. The use of oily mixtures for the care of the skin and of hair, both for detergent and for cosmetic purposes, has been already proposed in the past. According to the prior art these compositions were applied by rubbing the skin and or the hair and then removed. Possibly the composition was added with a surface active agent or emulsifying agent, in order to promote the removal of the composition by rinsing with water. Consequently according to the prior art it was taught to apply these compositions to the skin and or the hair by rubbing, maintaining the composition into contact with the skin and or the hair for some time, for instance some minutes or more, and thereafter rinsing with water, taking advantage of the fact that the presence of an emulsifying agent causes an emulsion to be formed by which the composition is more easily removed. In the pediatric field oily compositions have been and are used, with which the body is rubbed in the areas covered by absorbing napkins, in order to counterweight the macerating effect of the body liquids, and of faeces. The explanation resides also in that the baby skin is too delicate to stand the detergent action even of very mild soaps. In this connection it is worth reviewing the properties and main features of the lipidic film or sebum coating the skin. It is a hydrophilic, homogeneous, finely emulsified layer having important protecting functions. This lipidic film is generated, in varying amounts and composition, throughout the life of the human being both directly onto the surface of the skin and by suitable sebaceous glands. Some times, the sebum production is in excess with respect to the need of the skin seborrhea or in shortcoming alipic skin and in both cases disorders, anomalies, alterations and cutaneous defects are induced thus the importance of the sebum and of its biological role can be appreciated. Sebum as a matter of fact protects the skin from the atmospherical pollutants, from cutaneous steeping, from dehydration and from abrupt temperature variations. Moreover it acts as a surface shield against chemical aggressive substances, hindering their contact with the skin and their absoprtion. It acts also as a carrier for the precursors of vitamin D and is endowed with a relevant anti infective activity against several pathogenic micro organisms. Lastly, sebum has a lubricating, emollient and lenitive effect, thus inducing skin softness and turgidity and preventing an excessive evaporation of the surface water. Sebum is a semisolid lipidic mixture, consisting of triglycerides, free fatty acids, waxes, sterols and related esters,alcohols and hydrocarbons among which a typical example is squalene together with appreciable amounts of vitamins mainly provitamin D and vitamins A and E . Sebum, owing to the presence of cholesterol and of its esters, gives place to a water oil emulsion, which although being capable of including relevant amounts of water, maintains its lipidic non hydrodispersible character, whereby it can not be removed from the skin with the help of water alone. The skin cleaning means the removal of sebum, of waste and of dirt, but is not a physiological operation since it causes most of times the aforesaid lipidic protective layer to be removed too. The skin cleaning is however a necessary operation since not only dirt and wastes are to be removed, but also a portion of the surface sebum layer, namely the older one as regards its formation, must be taken away. In fact sebum, some time after its generation, undergoes chemical changes, owing to both the oxygen of the air and to microorganisms normally present onto the skin, these changes making the sebum irritating for the skin. Consequently, the need existed and exists of means capable of efficaciously removing from the skin wastes, dirt and the surface portion of the sebum, without fully removing the sebum layer, and without irritating the skin. Under this point of view, apart from soaps and detergent compositons, affected by the afore said drawbacks, also the so called cleaning milks are not suitable, since their cleaning action is not sufficient, both as regards the removal of the surface part of the sebum, and as regards the removal of heavier make up or dirt. The composition according to the present invention does fully solve the above mentioned problems and to this end consists in a mixture comprising As already indicated one of the essentiall component of the compositions of the present invention is an oil or a mixture of vegetal, mineral or animal oils. As examples of oils useful in the present invention, the following can be cited. For the mineral oils For the vegetal oils For the animal oils Among the synthetic oils, those already known in the cosmetic field can be used, such as for instance isopropyl myristate, palmitate and stearate, 2 octyldodecanol, decyl oleate, derivatives of isostearic acid, diisopropyladipate or myristyllactate. As a total or partial substitution for the oil the use is foreseen of a possibly vegetal gelatine, and in that case the density of the detergent composition of the invention can also be adjusted. The percent contents of oil or oil mixture in the subject composition varies between 80 and 98 by weight and is preferably of the order of 90 . Another essential component of the compositions according to the invention consists of an emulsifying mixture soluble in the subject oils, selected among anionic, cationic, non ionic and amphoteric emulsifiers. Specific examples of emulsifiers useful in the compositions of the present invention comprise As it is well known the emulsifying agents have no specific detergent action whereby as a matter of principle the combination of an oil and of an emulsifying substance should not have detergent action, but in fact the most surprising feature is that this combination acts as a soap when combined with water before being applied to the skin and is able to leave a lipidic layer onto the skin which means that only a portion of the sebum layer is removed. The subject emulsifiers are in turn contained in the composition of the invention in a percentage by weight of between 2 and 20 . According to a further feature of the invention a minor percentage of the emulsifiers can be substituted for by a conventional surface active agent. In this connection it is however to be pointed out that, in comparison with the prevailing amount of the oily component, the small percentage of surface active agent can be certainly responsible for the detergent action. According to the main feature of the present invention the presence is foreseen of a saccharose ester as one of the emulsifying agents, it has been found that they are endowed with a synergic action towards the other one or more emulsifying agents present in the composition, since the resulting emulsion is finer and is also softer and more flowable. This fact has been demonstrated by tests carried out with a composition of the present invention, namely comprising an oily part and an emulsifying agent, by adding a saccharose ester selected among saccharose monolaurate, monopalmitate, monosterate and distearate, the saccharose ester being added in the amount of 0.5 by weight of the composition. The control composition contained 72 of mineral oil, 25 of soya oil and 3 of polyoxythylenoleyl ether. The results are reported in the following table as the transparency T of the resulting emulsion at 650 nm and for several grades of dilution. As it can be appreciated from the values of transmittance, in all cases, the addition of saccharose esters induces an increase of the turbidity of the oil water emulsion which in turn gives place to a sensible increase of the milky consistency and thus to an increased detergent action. As regards the concentration of the saccharose ester it varies between 0.05 and 2 by weight referred to the weight of the composition. According to a further feature of the present invention the subject compositions are added with a powder clay of bentonite or montmorillonite type in fact it has been found that by such an addition the thickness of the lipidic layer remaining on the skin after the rinsing with water can be controlled. More particularly if the amount of the clay powder present in the composition is of between 0.5 and 1.5 by weight a more consistent thickness of the lipidic layer is obtained, which can be defined as making the skin overfatty, whereas if the content of clay powder is of between 1.5 and 10 , a creamy layer remains onto the skin. Otherwise stated, if the content of clay powder present in the composition is in the above lower interval the skin feels to be soft and a little greasy, whereas if the content is in upper interval the skin appears as when a cream layer is applied. According to a further feature of the invention the compositions of the present invention are also endowed with skin hydrating and restituting properties, as well as with a nutrient and revitalizing function. For the hydrating and restituting action the composition can be added with hydrating agents, such as for instance glycerin, urea and aminoacids which are very poorly or not soluble and not dispersible in the oils, by which the skin dehydration, as caused by the removal of natural hydrating substances as induced by the detergent action , is prevented. As regards the subject aminoacids, valine, isovaline, leucine and isoleucine can be cited. Their presence together with urea and glycerin gives place to the revitalizing action, whereas to get the nutrient effect a liposoluble vitamin such as vitamin A, E or F is added. According to a further feature of the invention, the subject compositions are used as hair shampoo instead of the known shampooing compositions, the latter always causing the removal from the scalp and from the hair of an excess of protecting sebum, whereby a so called reactive seborrhea is induced, which becomes worse if the washing frequency is increased. The use of the compositions of the invention as hair shampoo prevents the reactive seborrhea from occurring both because the conventional detergents are absent and because a hydrolipidic sebum like film remains in substitution for the removed natural sebum. In this connection it is worth reviewing the properties of the compositions of the present invention As an explanation of the favourable results of the compositions of the present invention, which however should not be considered as exhaustive or limiting, it is to be taken into account that the subject compositions, in the presence of water form a milky emulsion, most of which is of the type oil water, and is thus washable, whereas a small proportion is of the opposite type namely water oil the latter portion remains on the skin after the rinsing, thus giving place to the protective effect. In fact this layer substitutes the sebum portion which is removed, retaining its more important chemico physical and biological properties, and being at the same time more stable towards the oxidizing agents and more resistant to the microorganism attack. Some examples of formulation of the compositions of the invention are given hereinafter The above last three examples specifically relate to shampooing compositions.
