# Rubber composition for tires.

## Abstract
A rubber composition for tires having low rolling resistance and high wet skid resistance, breakage strength and wear resistance comprises a rubber component contain ing at least 20 parts by weight of a high vinyl butadiene styrene copolymer rubber obtained by randomly copolymer izing styrene with 1,3 butadiene, and containing 3 30 by weight of bonded styrene and 60 95 by weight of 1,2 bonds in the butadiene units, and further containing metal butadienyl bonds in its main chain in a weight fraction of at least 20 by weight.
