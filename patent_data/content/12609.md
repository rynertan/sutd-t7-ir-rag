# Method and apparatus for surface topography parameter evaluation.

## Abstract
A method of deriving the value of any one of the com monly used parameters for characterising surfaces in surface measurement technology involves the computation of the values σ², σ² ρ₁, σ²ρ₂ of specific points on the autocorrela tion of a signal representative of height variations in the sur face under test. These autocorrelation values are then selec tively utilised together with the value h of a sampling interval used in generating these autocorrelation values, to derive the desired parameter values. This method considerably simpli fies the information on a surface which is required. Apparatus for effecting this method includes a correlator arranged to generate signals representative of the autocorrelation values σ², σ² ρ₁, σ² ρ₂ and of the sampling interval h .
