# Mounting means of an insert in an electrical connector housing.

## Abstract
The invention is a one piece molded electrical connector insert that snaps in to a connector housing without the need for additional mounting members or chemical bonding. The insert includes a plurality of resiliently and radially deflect able fingers 21 disposed around the outside of the insert and a second plurality of resiliently and axially deflectable fingers 22 also disposed on the outside of the insert 20 and adjacent to first plurality of fingers 21. The radial fingers 21 and axial fingers 22 completely fill a groove 15 in the inside of a connector housing 10 to prevent axial movement of the insert once it is mounted in the connector housing 10.
