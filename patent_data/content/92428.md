# A method for producing a piezoelectric resonator.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric resonator comprises a base plate 24 with a strip type, energy trapping type piezoelectric resonator chip 22 mounted on it. The piezoelectric resonator chip 22 com prises a piezoelectric chip plate 26 and a pair of electrode pat terns 27, 27 formed on opposed main surfaces of the piezo electric chip plate 22. One main surface of the piezoelectric chip plate 22 faces the base plate 24 and is parallel to it and a conductive layer 28 , 29 is formed on each end of the main surface of the chip plate 22 facing the base plate 24. The thickness of the conductive layer 28 , 29 , is thicker than that of the electrode pattern 27 so that the electrode pattern is not in contact with the base plate 24. The conductive layer 28 , 29 , is directly mounted on a conductive portion 32, 33 of the base plate 24 to electrically connect the electrode pattern 27, 27 and the conductive portion 32, 33, of the base plate 24.
