# Multiple magnetic pump system.

## Abstract
A multiple magnetic pump system comprises a plurality of pump chambers a pair of inlet and outlet ports provided in each of the pump chambers an impeller rotatably supported in each of the pump chambers and having a driven magnetic ma terial and a driving magnetic material connected to a driving source so as to drive the impeller via the driven magnetic ma terial. There is provided a single driving shaft of the driving source, and each of the pump chambers has a tubular member which defines a through hole therein and partitions the through hole from the pump chamber so as to allow the single driving shaft to be inserted into each of the through hole of the plural ity of casings. The impeller is rotatably mounted on each of the tubular members.
