## Description
CORROSION PREVENTIVE COMPOSITION This invention relates to a composition for use in protection of metal surfaces from corrosion. It is often appropriate to protect metal surfaces from corrosion by means of paints, varnishes, lacquers, plastics and metal coatings or the like.These coatings are characterised by being essentially solid and in many cases, hard and inflexible. It is frequently desirable to protect metal surfaces by means of soft, flexible coatings which remain in this condition throughout the service life of the surface.It is an object of this invention to provide a composition which forms such a coating but which is not liquid and may not flow from a coated surface. According to the present invention a corrosion preventive composition comprises a corrosion inhibitor and a thickening agent, the composition being a thixotropic gel. The term gel is intended to refer to materials having semi solid, buttery, jelly like or grease like properties. A composition in accordance with this invention is advantageous in that it may be conveniently applied to a surface as a liquid for example by brushing, spraying, swabbing or flooding. Subsequent gelation or solidification provides a coating which remains in place and does not drip or flow from the surface. Drainage from the surface may result in uneconomical loss of the composition and in thinning of the coating with consequent reduction in the degree of protection of the surface. A preferred composition is highly pseudoplastic that is there is a substantial reduction in viscosity with increasing shear rate. A gel like composition in accordance with the invention may, therefore, become mobile either when agitated or during application to a surface, for example by brushing or spraying etc. The semi solid nature of the gel serves to resist washing of the gel from the surface by rain or condensed moisture. Furthermore, atmospheric particulate matter such as dust, fibres, carbon particles, salt particles or aerosols cannot penetrate to the metal surface. The composition may include a liquid medium.This may comprise one or more oils added to the composition. The medium serves either to dissolve the inhibitor or to give a uniform suspension of the latter. Media which may be used in accordance with this invention include oils of mineral, vegetable or animal origin or derived from these by a variety of chemical processes.Oils prepared by chemical combinations of such precursors as alcohols, esters, carboxylic acids, phosphorus acids, organo silicon compounds, glycols, fluorocarbons and the like, known broadly as synthetic oils, may also be used. Any oil may be used which is fluid or semi solid, substantially insoluble in water and of low volatility under ambient conditions or other conditions of use. Use of an additional liquid medium may be omitted when the inhibitor or blend of inhibitors is a liquid. The corrosion inhibitor may comprise one or more compounds which may be organic, inorganic, naturally occurring or synthetic. Preferred inhibitors include lanoline lanoline esters carboxylic acid esters of polyols including esters of glycerol, sorbitol and sorbitan naphthenic acids and their metallic and amine salts polybasic acids including dimer and trimer acids and their salts and esters petroleum sulphonates and salts thereof including synthetic equivalents such as the Nasul series of compounds R.T.Vanderbilt sarkosine derivatives amines amides heterocyclic nitrogen compounds and their derivatives including benzotriazole, tolyltriazole, substituted benzimidazoles and oxidised petrolatums including those known as Alox Alox Corporation, U.S.A. Hypax Carless Chemicals Ltd and Crodax Croda Metal Treatments Ltd . The nature and use of these and other inhibitors is described by J.I.Bregman1 corrosion Inhibitors , Macmillan, 1963. Preferred inhibitors or blends of inhibitors are effective in preventing corrosion, soluble or dispersible in an oil or blend of oils, easy to manipulate, non toxic and do not interact with each other in blends or with other ingredients of the composition so as to adversely affect the properties. Combinations of inhibitors may exhibit synergism in their properties. The thickening agent used in a composition in accordance with this invention may be selected from finely divided silica, asbestos fibres, finely divided carbon such as carbon black, acetylene black or graphite, clays such as montmorillite or attapulgite, organic pigments such as phthalocyanine or metallic complexes thereof, finely divided inorganic compounds such as metal carbonates, oxides, hydroxides, silicates, lithium compounds such as lithium hydroxystearate or other inorganic carboxylates. Compositions in accordance with this invention may include a thickening agent which has been treated to cause it to exhibit hydrophobic properties. Thus thickening agents which are hydrophilic in nature such as silica, asbestos, clays or metal salts may be treated with additives such as silicones, highly fluorinated surface active agents, polyalkyl polychlorosilane, e.g. dimethyl dichloro silane, styrene or other polymerisable substances, moisture repellent polymers, cationic materials such as amined, amides and quaternary ammonium salts, fatty acids, mono and polyhydric alcohols and esters thereof. The addition may be used either to pretreat the thickening agent or may be added during mixture of the compositions. Use of agents which render the thickening agent hydrophobic serves to improve the resistance of the composition to moisture.A particular thickening agent or mixtures thereof may be selected to meet the requirements of the composition. Preferred compositions in accordance with this invention exhibit reversible gel formation. Such compositions may be stored for prolonged periods in the gel form without loss of ability to revert to a fluid under shear during application to a surface. It is particularly preferred that the gel formation and breaking is repeatedly reversible without deterioration of the pseudoplastic, thixotropic or other properties. The time that the composition takes to form or reform a gel may be important. In some cases it is preferred that gelation occurs instantly upon application of the composition to a surface. Thick coatings may be applied without drainage or loss.In alternative circumstances it may be preferred that the composition remains in a generally fluid condition for a prolonged period to facilitate flow and penetration of the composition into otherwise inaccessible. locations. Preferred thickening agents impart heat resistance to compositions in accordance with the invention by reducing melting or flow of the latter. Compositions in accordance with his invention may incorporate secondary thickening agents. The latter may serve as partial replacements for the thickening agents, thereby reducing the cost of the composition. Alternatively, the secondary thickening agents may supplement the primary thickening agents. Preferred secondary thickening agents include alkaline alkaline earth, aluminium or other metallic soaps of aliphatic acids, naphthenic acids, rosin, tall oil, oxidised petrolatums, alkyl and aralkyl sulphonic acids, mahogany acids, degras and the like. The rheology of compositions in accordance with the invention which include a thickening agent and a secondary thickening agent may be modified by addition of one or more polar additives. The polar additives may be present in an amount from a trace to 10 by weight of the composition. A preferred range is from 0.5 to 2.08 by weight. Suitable polar additives include water, mono and polyhydric alcohols, glycols including butyl glycol, polyglycols, polymers of ethylene and propylene oxides, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, short chain polyalkylene oxides and amines. The polar additives may function by crosslinking the mineral particles or fibres by hydrogen bonding. A wide range of compounds capable of forming hydrogen bonds may, therefore, be used as polar additives. An important property of compositions in accordance with this invention is syneresis. A composition may afford protection to inaccessible surfaces such as crevices between closely fitting components or other regions remote from the point of application of the composition by exudation or bleeding of the inhibitor from the body of the gel. The composition may by this means also serve to actively protect cracks or fissures from corrosion as they may form during weathering or flexure in use. For the protection of moving surfaces especially from fretting corrosion, it is sometimes desirable that a corrosion preventive material in accordance with this invention should possess lubricating properties either inherently or by means of the use of additives. The additives may be of the type which substantially dissolve in the medium, e.g. those usually termed extreme pressure additives or boundary lubricants, or solid lubricants such as graphite, molybdenum disuiphide, polytetrafluoroethylene and the like. In the case of the solid lubricants it is important that the physical form of the medium shall prevent or reduce the tendency of the solid phase to settle or sediment out.It is especially beneficial if the solid phase can be maintained in suspension in the presence of large amounts of solvent or thinners since this can facilitate application by brushing, dipping, spraying etc., without the need for frequent agitation to maintain a uniform dispersion of the solid phase in the medium. A composition in accordance with this invention may include an antioxidant, for example the compound marketed by ICI Ltd., under the trade mark PERMANEX. A composition in accordance with this invention may also include an antifoaming agent to facilitate the addition of the thickening agent to the mixture. A convenient antifoaming agent is the silicone fluid oil M S 200. Dow Corning Co. Corrosion preventive compositions prepared in accordance with this invention are especially useful where a low solvent or solvent free material is desired and where the product must be sufficiently mobile at the time of application to permit easy handling and simple spray, brush, smear, jet, dip, flooding or similar application while remaining substantially in place following deposition. Solvent free or low solvent compositions are desirable for the protection of enclosed areas where solvent retention in the area can result in the wash off of the corrosion preventive from surfaces due to continual evaporation and condensation of the trapped solvent. Examples of this kind of use include the box sections of vehicles, tubes, cavities formed by double skin structures such as those found in airframes and vehicle parts, cables and their coverings, enclosed mechanisms such as locks, motors, gearboxes, pumps, electrical devices such as switches, servo mechanisms, measuring instruments, potentiometers and the like. The composition may be injected through apertures such as keyholes into enclosed mechanisms. The invention also finds use in treatment of welded joints due to the syneretic release of the inhibitor into cracks and other inaccessible areas.The composition could also be applied, for example, by an aerosol applicator as a lubricant for drilling. Use of the composition for internal protection of gears and other mechanisms such as chain drives is particularly advantageous since the pseudoplasticity of the composition reduces the power losses therein. A low solvent or solvent free corrosion preventive composition is also useful where, following application to the surface to be protected, a subsequent shrinkage of the protective due to the evaporation of solvent is undesirable. An example is the protection of cables and electrical and fibre optic conductors, especially the multi stranded and normally helically wound conductors used in electrical power transmission and distribution. These are normally constructed of aluminium and, in some cases, reinforced by steel wires. Since the conductors and their connectors are generally exposed permanently to external weathering conditions often in highly corrosive marine and industrial environments, it is necessary to apply a corrosion preventive both during manufacture and to conductors and connectors which have been erected. Any diminution of the volume or shrinkage of the protective following application tends to leave voids in the interstitial spaces between the strands of the conductor. The voids allow the accumulation and retention of moisture within the conductor with the resultant increase in corrosion rate. Compositions for protection of conductors preferably have lubricating properties to minimise fretting corrosion. Low solvent and solvent free compositions prepared in accordance with this invention have been found to be suitable for the protection of multi stranded wire ropes, cables and conductors since they are easily applied, penetrate readily into the cable to protect the innermost strands and remain in place thereafter. Also, importantly, since little or no solvent need be present, a negligible shrinkage occurs. Thus according to a preferred aspect of the present invention a method of treatment of electrical cables comprises coating of the cables with a composition in accordance with this invention. The treatment of electrical cables may comprise pretreatment prior to installation or may comprise treatment of existing cables in situ, for example using a trolley moveable along the cable by means of pulleys. The method of treatment has the advantage over conventional methods that the composition does not require heating to melt it before application. The syneretic property of the composition is particularly advantageous in treatment of multicore cables. Compositions in accordance with preferred aspects of the invention may be easily cleaned from surfaces, thus facilitating use for temporary protection of metal surfaces during storage, transportation or export. The invention will now be further described by means of examples. The compositions disclosed herein are described by weight. Example 1 A corrosion preventive fluid was prepared by blending together a hydrofinished naphthenic oil having a density of 0.93 and a viscosity at 200C of 150 centistoke sorbitan mono oleate, N oleyl sarkosine and an antioxidant Oil 57 parts Sorbitan Mono oleate 35 parts N Oleyl Sarkosine 7 parts Antioxidant 1 partThe above fluid was thickened and processed to form a pseudoplastic thixotropic gel by the slow addition of chrysotile asbestos fibres having a fibre length of approximately 5.0 microns and a length diameter ratio of arond 200. The chrysotile was added with vigorous agitation using a mechanical mixer until a fairly soft buttery consistency was imparted to the mixture. 6 based on the weight of corrosion preventive fluid was found to be sufficient. In practice the exact amount of chrysotile needed has been found to vary with the degree and time of agitation. To illustrate some of the rheological properties of this product, a series of viscosity measurements was made at 200C using a Brookfield viscometer fitted with a number 7 spindle. The results are set out in Table 1. Table 1 Viscosity cST after days Speed rpm 0. 4. 11. 15. 5 204,000 178,000 200,000 180,000 20 70,000 59,500 68,000 64, 0o 80 33,600 30,800 33,200 31,600 100 20,200 18,600 20,400 19,400 The compositionwas a non Newtonian, pseudoplastic material and the viscosity was highly shear dependent. Additionally, the composition was thixotropic and formed a stable gel instantly on cessation of agitation or shear. This combination of properties enabled the product to be easily manipulated and applied to metal surfaces in any desired thickness up to several centimetres without loss or drainage. Measurements over several days clearly showed no major changeQ deterioration in rheological properties.EXAMPLE 2 A composition was prepared according toExample 1 in which one part of ethylene glycol was added to the corrosion preventive fluid prior to the thickening step with chrysotile.EXAMPLES 3 10 Compositions were prepared according toExample 2 in which the ethylene glycol was replaced by diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, hexylene glycol, dimethyl formamide or dimethyl sulphoxide respective y. EXAMPLE 11 A composition was prepared according toExample 1 in which the gelling agent consisted essentially of finely divided silicon dioxide having an ultimate average particle size of 5 25nm and a surface area of 1OO 300m2g 1The silicon dioxide was incorporated incrementally until the consistency of a heavy oil was attained.This required six parts of silicon dioxide based on 100 parts of the corrosion preventive fluid. As in previous examples, the degree of thickening was found to be highly dependent on the degree of agitation and to a lesser extent on the time of agitation during and following the addition of the thickening agent. Thus the amount of thickening agent required to achieve a specific viscosity, degree of pseudoplasticity and thixotropy was dependent upon the shear rate and time. In this example, the peripheral shear rate using a Hobart planetary mixer of 20 litres capacity was approximately 250cm sec l and mixing was continued at this rate for 20 minutes following the addition of the silicon dioxide. Example 12 A composition was prepared according toExample 11 in which the finely divided silicon dioxide was pretreated with dichiorodimethylsilane to render the normally hydrophilic surface of the silicon dioxide partially hydrophobic. This was accomplished by the reaction of freshly prepared silicon dioxide having an average primary particle size of 5 25nm with steam and dichlorodimethyl silane simultaneously in such a way that a proportion of the silanol groups on the silicon dioxide surface reacted to form hydrophobic methyl bearing groups, Aerosil R 972, Degussa . Example 13 Corrosion preventive fluid prepared according to Example 1 was thickened using a treated bentonite clay Bentone 34, NL Industries Inc. USA . A masterbatch was first prepared by mixing 85 parts of the corrosion preventive fluid with 15 parts of Bentone 34 in a triple roll paint mill. To one hundred parts of the masterbatch, a further 200 parts of the corrosion preventive fluid was added followed by 5 parts of propylene carbonate. A mixture of semi solid gel consistency resulted. As in earlier examples, it was found that the processing conditions milling time, degree of shear etc. can greatly influence the rheological properties of the final product. It was often necessary therefore to adjust the amount of Bentone used to a level appropriate to the type of mill and the processing conditions. Generally 3 8 was sufficent using Bentone 34.EXAMPLES 14 24 Compositions were prepared according toExample 13 in which the corrosion preventive fluid consisted of oil and corrosion inhibitors based on oxidised and processed petrolatums of unknown detailed structure and composition. These are sold under various trade names such as Alox , Crodax and Hypax . Thus compositions were prepared in which the corrosion prevention fluid contained 60 parts oil and 40 parts respectively of Alox 319F,Alox 2028Alox 2162, Alox 2201, Alox 2213A, Alox 2263,Hypax 450, Hypax 450 A3, Hypax TP10, Hypax EM 102,Crodax 50, Crodax 100 and Crodax 235.EXAMPLES 25 35 A series of compositions were prepared according to Examples 14 24 in which the gelling agent and method of preparation were in accordance with Example 12. Example 36 A product was prepared according to Example 25, using 8 parts of the hydrophobic silicon dioxide Aerosil R972, Degussa per hundred parts of corrosion preventive fluid and Alox 2028 as the corrosion inhibitor and tested to show the advantage of this invention. Using a Brookfield model LVT viscometer fitted with the number 4 spindle, viscosity measurements were made at several rotational speeds. The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Speed Viscosity log 10 viscosity rpm CPS mPa.s 12.0 47.5 x 103 4.68 6.0 77.0 x 103 4.87 3.0 140.0 x 103 5.15 1.5 256.0 x 10 5.41 0,6 580.0 x 103 5.76 0.3 1,080.0 x 103 6.03 The composition was found to have a pseudoplasticity index of 7.0 8.0, this being calculated as the viscosity at x r.p.m. . viscosity at 10 x r.p.m. It was noted that on discontinuingthe shear the viscosity recovered immediately to a higher value. The importance of this feature for certain applications has been discussed. When allowed to stand the composition slowly formed a gel over a period of around three hours. The product thus became substantially immobile enabling a bulk of material or very thick films to remain in place on or within a metal structure after a degree of earlier mobility had allowed the preservative to flow into position. The gelled material was agitated and allowed to regel 100 times and no change was observed in the physical properties. This is important for the storage and manipulation of the product in practice. A metal panel was coated with the composition to a thickness of approximately 2mm and allowed to stand for several hours. The coated panel was then heated in a vertical position for 100 hours at 1000C. Examination showed that the coating remained in place with no drainage or melting. On raising the temperature gradually to 2000C no change occurred apart from a slight darkening of the film.At temperatures higher than 200 C the preservative began to decompose with the evolution of gases.The physical and chemical stability of the product was limited only by the nature of the oil and inhibitors present and not by the gelling system. A 2.0cm diameter circle was scribed on the surface of a clean steel panel which had been prepared to Defence Standard 05 50 1, Method 25.1.0g of the composition was placed in the circle and worked so as to coat the circular area. The panel was allowed to stand at 20 C in a horizontal position for ten days after which it was placed horizontally in a closed vessel over an aqueous solution of 200ppm 0.02 sulphur dioxide so as to cause the unprotected metal surface to rapidly corrode. After five days the metal panel was examined and it was found that, in addition to protecting the area within the circle wherein the composition had been formally applied, effective protection had extended approximately a further 1.0cm beyond the scribed circle to give an extra annular rust free area.It was concluded that part of the inhibitor system had exuded from the bulk of the corrosion preventive and migrated along the metal surface by means of a combination of syneresis and surface tension effects in such a way as to more than double the expected area of protection. In practice this important property enabled crevices and areas of difficult access to be protected from corrosion without the need to ensure complete coverage of the surfaces at the time of application. The product was coated onto metal panels prepared to Defence Standard 05 50 1, Method 25, to film thickness of approximately 2.0 sum. This was achieved by dipping the panels in a 25 solution of the product in white spirit BS 245 and allowing to drain and dry at 200C. i Salt Water To test the resistance afforded by the product to corrosion by the action of highly corrosive saline conditions, panels were partially immersed in 3 aqueous solution of sodium chloride. ii Sulphur Dioxide The effect of exposure to aggressive industrial environments was simulated by exposure of coated panels to the vapours over a 0.02 aqueous solution of sulphur dioxide in a closed vessel. iii Acetic Acid Woods, certain plastics, rubbersç paints, adhesives, paper and fabrics are known to release acetic and other volatile corrosive acids especially under conditions of high temperatures and humidity. vide Defence Standard 03 13 Issue 1, 1977 This is of particular importance in the prevention of corrosion of machinery and metal parts which are stored or packaged with acid releasing materials in confined areas where the accumulation of aggresive vapours is possible e.g. export packaging. Accordingly, the efficacy of the product in protecting metals from acetic acid fumes was assessed by exposing coated panels to the vapours over a 1 aqueous solution of glacial acetic acid in a closed vessel. The above corrosion tests were conducted on mild steel, aluminium, zinc, copper, brass, claim., tin and silver. The zinc,cadmium and tin were in the form of plated steel . The tests were carried out in triplicate at 20 v C and, for purposes of comparison, control experiments using similarly prepared but uncoated panels were run simultaneously. The progress of the tests was followed by visual examination and judged to be complete when substantial discoloration or accumulation of corrosion products appeared on the surfaces of the untreated control specimens. For example, in the case of steel, the surface of the control was encrusted with the familiar red brown rust or black oxides of iron the aluminium control presented a grey or white powdery appearance brass a dark brown or green coating and so on. At this point, the coated panels were washed with clean water, rinsed with acetone and allowed to dry. The degree of corrosion was then assessed visually on a scale of O 5 0 represented a negligible protection from corrosion, with the test panels in a similar condition to those of the control, and 5 represented 100 protection with the panel surfaces substantially in the same condition as at the beginning of the test. The results are presented in the Table 3. Table 3 3 NaCl 0.01 SO2 1. O CH3CO2H Steel 5 5 5Aluminium 5 5 5Zinc 4 4 3Copper 5 4 4 3 NaCl 0.01 SO2 l.0 CH3CO2H Brass 5 5 4Cadmium 4 5 5Tin 5 5 5Silver 4 5 5 150mm lengths of multi stranded ACSR aluminium conductor steel reinforced wen degreased and exposed intermittently to a 0.1 M solution of NaCl. An a.c.potential of 2.0 volts was applied between two adjacent aluminium strands. The onset and rate of corrosion was followed and measured by observation of the d.c. voltage shift with respect to a calomel electrode half cell and the current flowing. The degreased and therefore unprotected specimens began to corrode after an induction period of several hours s and the rate of corrosion reached a maximum within 1 10 hours of corrosion starting. Samples examined visually at intervals showed increased amounts of corrosion as the test proceeded. A number of the specimens were allowed to reach the maximum corrosion rate and, at this point, allowed to partially dry 200C for 3 hours and a product prepared in accordance with Example 36 was applied to the outer surface of the conductor. The test was then continued as before and the specimens exposed intermittently to the salt water. After 1 2 days the a.c. current and d.c.potentials resumed their inactive levels indicating a dramatic fall in the corrosion rate to the point where it virtually ceased. The test was allowed to continue for a further five months and, in the case of the conductors treated with the product, no corrosion occurred even under these arduous conditions. Similar tests with conventional greases gave no degree of protection. The outstanding advantages gained by use of this invention are fourfold i the product applied to the outer strands of the conductor was able to penetrate inwards. ii In so doing it was capable of displacing salt solution from the surface of the strands. iii On reaching the site of corrosion, the corrosion which was already underway was halted. This is especially noteworthy since it is known to be much more difficult to prevent corrosion which has already beçln than to prevent its onset. iv The protection was permanent within the parameters of the test and corrosion was prevented from restarting.
