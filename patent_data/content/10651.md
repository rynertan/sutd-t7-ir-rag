# Preparation of fluoroorganic compounds with calcium fluoride.

## Abstract
Fluoroorganic compounds are prepared by react ing a haloorganic starting material in which at least one halo atom is replaceable with a fluorine atom by met athetical exchange, with calcium fluoride in the presence of a cage compound and an anhydrous, polar, basic organic solvent which complexes with the calcium ion and contains no OH groups, at a temperature and for a period of time adequate to effect fluorination.
