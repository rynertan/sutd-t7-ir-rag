# Unit for preventing an interception of a radio communication signal transmitted between a fixed facility and a mobile station.

## Abstract
In a radio frequency communication system in which a radio frequency communication signal is transmitted be tween a radio terminal 14 and a mobile station 24 , it may be that an unauthorized third person uses a scanner receiv er 60 to intercept the communication signal. In order to prevent such an interception, the unit comprises a detecting circuit 30 for detecting an internal signal which is trans mitted between a telephone exchange 12 and the radio terminal 14 and is concerned with an ordinary voice sig nal. The detection circuit produces a detection signal when the internal signal is absent. Responsive to the detection signal, a control circuit 32 controls the internal signal to prevent the interception, as by sending a dummy voice sig nal whenever the ordinary voice signal is absent. Alterna tively, the control circuit may produce a control signal while the communication signal is received from the mobile sta tion and consequently while the internal signal is sent from the radio terminal to the exchange. In this event, the control signal is used either in attenuating or switching off an echo signal which usually results from the internal signal reach ing the exchange.
