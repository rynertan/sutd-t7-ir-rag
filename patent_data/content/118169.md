# Thin film magnetic writing head with anti saturation back gap layer.

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing a magnetic image in a magne tic image storage medium. The apparatus includes a thin film magnetic web 12 with a pole defining face and a second thin film blanket 24 magnetically spaced from the first magnetic web and having a second surface defining a second pole face. Spaced from the pole faces is a diamagne tic spacer 16 which forms a special back gap in the magnetic circuit. An electrical coil 20b sandwiched between the two magnetic materials induces flux in them. The spacer 16 may extend normal to the flux path beyond the effective flux paths otherwise existing in the web and blanket.
