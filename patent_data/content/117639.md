# Data display keyboard with angular positioning.

## Abstract
A data display device has a manual input keyboard device that is infinitely adjustable with respect to its supporting surface between predetermined limits. The angular displacement mecha nism that provides this adjustment is made up of a fixed arbor 39 R L attached to the keyboard device and a rotating arbor 38 R L attached to a foot. The arbors are axially aligned and rotatably connected together by a clutch coil spring 35 R L . A manually operable push button mechanism 26 on the keyboard device is linked to the tang of the coil spring 36 R L so that when depressed, the tang is moved in a direction to unwind the coil spring, thereby permitting the rotating arbor to rotate with respect to the fixed arbor, moving the foot away from the keyboard device. A tilt torsion spring 40 R 40 L is anchored to the movable arbor and connected to the keyboard device to cause the rotatable arbor to rotate when the push button 26 is actuated thus moving the foot with respect to the keyboard device. Releasing the push button permits stopping the move ment of the foot at any desired position.
