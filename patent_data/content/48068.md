# A method for combatting of targets and projectile or missile for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
The invention relates to combatting of hostile targets M by firing of controllable explosive projectiles or missiles P, PO towards the target, which projectiles or missiles are provided with target tracking devices for automatic guidance of the projectile or missile by reception and detection of electromagnetic radiation originating from the target. In order to improve the accuracy of fire at least one projectile or missile fired in a burst is provided with transmitter means T, A1 which are activated after detection of a target M for transmission of a signal indicating the position of the target relative to the projectile to following projectiles in the burst. In these following projectiles P a correction of the projectile trajectory in direction to a trajectory passing through the target is effected by means of the position indicating signal from the preceeding projectile PO . Suitably all projectiles in a burst can be provided with such transmitter means T, A1 . Hereby each projectile in the burst will get a more correct trajectory towards the target as compared the closest foregoing projectile and reliable hit will be ensured after a relatively small number of projectiles. The target tracking device may be of any known type, as devices of radiometric type, radar or IR type electro optical tracking device operat ing with visible light or laser light.
