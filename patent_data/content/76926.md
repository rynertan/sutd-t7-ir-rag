# Fuel supply apparatus for a diesel engine.

## Abstract
A fuel supply apparatus for a diesel engine includes a fuel tank 11 and a fuel injection pump 12 . The fuel injec tion pump 12 has an inlet and an overflow outlet. A fuel feed line 14 connects the fuel tank 11 to the inlet of the fuel injection pump 12 . A fuel feed pump 20 is disposed in the fuel feed line 14 to supply fuel from the fuel tank 11 to the fuel injection pump 12 . A fuel filter 13 is disposed along the fuel feed line 14 . A main fuel return line 17 connects the overflow outlet of the fuel injection pump 12 to the fuel tank 11 . An auxiliary fuel return line 18 con nects the overflow outlet of the fuel injection pump 12 to the fuel feed line 14 at a position upstream of the fuel filter 13 . A control valve 19 is disposed in the auxiliary fuel return line 18 to selectively block the latter. A device drives the control valve 19 in response to the temperature of fuel in the fuel filter 13 so that the control valve 19 will block the auxiliary fuel return line 18 only when the temperature of fuel in the fuel filter 13 is higher than a preset value.
