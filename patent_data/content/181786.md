# Control system for an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
A system is provided with an electromagnetic clutch 1 for transmitting the output of an engine to a transmission. During the deceleration of the vehicle when the throttle valve moves to an idling position, whilst the clutch is disengaged, a transmission ratio control valve 50 is operated to upshift the transmission, whereby the speed of a drive pulley 24 of the transmission is decreased to the engine idling speed
