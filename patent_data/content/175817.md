# Cutting torch.

## Abstract
In a cutting torch a fuel oxygen pre heating mixture is supplied through a passageway 47 to a torch tip. In order to prevent a flash back leading to sustained burning within the torch, the mixture is produced within a passageway 49 extending through a cylindrical mixer body 33 in alignment with the passageway 47 . The mixer body 33 is retained by a plug 35 in a cylindrical chamber 31 in the torch and clearances about the mixer body provide first and second annular spaces 51,61 separated from each other by an O ring 43 encircling the mixer body approximately midway along its length. Oxygen is fed into the first annular space 51 whence it flows round the end of the mixer body into the longitudinal through passageway 49 and thence into the mixture passageway 47 at the opposite end of the mixer body. The fuel gas is fed into the second annular space 61 and flows through a plurality of radial bores 59 into the longitudinal through passageway 49 at an intermediate point therealong.
