# Ribbon lift and feed mechanism for a movable print carrier typewriter printer.

## Abstract
A ribbon lift and feed mechanism for a typewriter printer 10 in which the print ribbon cartridge 15 has deflectable arms 16a, 16b for placing the ribbon 13 in a position confronting the platen 11 of the typewriter 10 . On the platform 40 , supporting the ribbon cartridge 15 , is a shuttle 50 which is remotely oscillated as by a drive motor 90 on the frame 12 of the typewriter 10 . Translation of the shuttle 50 and the cam 66 associated with the shuttle 50 effects movement of cam follower 66a engageable with the cam 66 , causing the deflectable arms 16a, 16b of the cartridge 15 to oscillate between a rest and elevated position to place different portions of the print ribbon 13 intermediate the type element 23 and the platen 11 . The shuttle 50 also carries ribbon feed drive means 85 which cause an incremental feed of the ribbon 13 after the ribbon has been struck at multiple elevated positions. Moreover, by placing a correction ribbon cartridge 30 beneath the rib bon cartridge 15 , another cam 70 on the shuttle can effect platform 40 elevation when it is desired to dispose the correction ribbon 31 intermediate the printing element 23 and the platen 11 . This action occurs as a result of the oscillation of the shuttle 50 .
