# Compositions for forming poly oxazolidone urethane thermosets.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a prepolymer containing two terminal epoxide groups and two non terminal, secondary hydroxy groups characterised in that it comprises reacting, in a single step, a polyol, an acid anhydride and a diepoxide is dis closed. A composition for the production of a thermoset compo sition containing oxazolidone and urethane linkages character ised in that it comprises a polyisocyanate and a prepolymer composition comprising a prepolymer containing two terminal epoxy groups and two non terminal, secondary hydroxy groups is also disclosed. A thermoset composition characterised in that it com prises oxazolidone and urethane linkages in the recurring unit which is essentially free of isocyanurate linkages, the said oxa zolidone linkages being present in the polymer backbone and being separated from one another by ester linkages and the said urethane linkages being present in side chains attached to the polymer backbone is further disclosed. The present invention provides advantages over the prior art.
