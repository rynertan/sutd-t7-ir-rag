## Description
This invention relates to a reactive ion etching process for etching a ceramic partially masked with a photoresist. The use of SF₆ as an etchant gas is disclosed in US A 4,330,384. US A 4,447,290 describes the use of SF₆ with the addition of Freon 12 as an indicator gas for the plasma etching of polysilicon. In fabricating integrated circuits, it is sometimes desirable to etch deep pockets or holes 10 to 20 µm deep into ceramics which are difficult or impossible to etch by conventional wet chemical means. Such etching may be accomplished by subjecting the ceramic which is partially masked by an organic photoresist to reactive ion etching. However, the etch rates using conventional RIE processes are typically very slow. Ceramics of interest can be rapidly etched by utilising a high power density 1 watt cm² SF₆ RIE process, but in this process the photoresist mask is eroded much more rapidly than the ceramic is etched. In this case the mask does not endure long enough to achieve the required etch depth in the ceramic. In other words, the ratio of the etch rate of the photoresist mask to the etch rate of the ceramic is not low enough. In fact, it is so unfavourable that the mask erodes 8 times faster than the ceramic etches. The present invention provides a solution to the problem of photoresist mask degradation during reactive ion etching processes using SF₆ as the etchant gas. By means of the present invention, the ratio of the etch rate of the photoresist to the etch rate of a ceramic has been decreased to below 5 which is satisfactory. A reactive ion etching process for etching a ceramic partially masked by a photoresist is characterised according to the invention, by the etch gas consisting of SF₆, a noble gas and a small percentage by volume of a carbon containing gas. Prior to the present invention, SF₆ had not been a satisfactory etch gas when ceramic and photoresist were being simultaneously etched. Even though SF₆ makes it possible to achieve faster rates than previously obtained, it has the disadvantage of attacking the organic photoresist and causing degradation. For example, when a resist mask comprising poly methylmethacrylate was etched with 100 SF₆, areas where resist bridged from row to row in the carrier were destroyed. Attack of the protective surface also occurred by etchant penetration through the resist, or percolation under the resist edges. Dilution of SF₆ with an inert gas, such as argon or helium, decreases the degradation of the resist somewhat however, at best, the results are marginal. To achieve the desired depth of etch, this etch rate ratio must be 5 or less. It has now been found that when a small amount of a carbon containing gas is added to the etch gas, both the etch rate for photoresist and for ceramic decrease. The etch rate for photoresist, however, decreased more than that for ceramic. A 13 addition of a carbon containing gas depressed the reactive ion etch rate for photoresist by 25 , while the etch rate for ceramic was depressed by only 5 . Satisfactory carbon containing gases include CF₄, C₁₂F₆ and CHF₃. The most preferred gas is CHF₃. Experimental results using various etch gas mixtures are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below. Our experiments indicate the optimum etch gas to be SF₆ with an approximately equal amount of a noble gas, and a small percentage, say about 10 , of a carbon containing gas, preferably CHF₃. The best etch gas composition is 45 SF₆, 45 He and 10 CHF₃. Gases are mixed by mass flow controllers therefore the percentages are volume percentages.
