# Barrierless disposable absorbent article having an absorbent core encased in a homogeneous outer wrap.

## Abstract
An article of manufacture is disclosed for absorbing liquids, particularly body exudates such as menstrual dis charges. An absorbent core 25 is encased in a homogeneous outer wrap 12 which may be either unitary or integral. The outer wrap has a specified combination of caliper C1 , apex opening 30 as measured by the maximal diagonal, and a ratio of the apparent caliper C2 to the maximal diagonal of the largest apex opening which impart an ability of the outer wrap to function both as a topsheet portion and as a backsheet portion without the necessity of providing a barrier within the article.
