# Process for producing a poly alumino silicate and product prepared by this process.

## Abstract
In a process for preparing particulate, porous, water insoluble amorphous poly alumino silicate having a Si Al gram atomic ratio of about 1 1 to 10 1, a pore volume of greater than 0.5 ml g, an average pore diameter of 50 to 200 Å and a surface area of 200 to 600 m² g by mixing an aqueous solution of an appropriate aluminate and an aqueous solution of an appropriate silicate, allowing the aluminate and silicate in the resultant mixture to polymerize to poly alumino silicate , freezing the mixture and thereafter isolating, wash ing, drying and recovering particulate poly alumino silicate therefrom, said process characterized in that a the amounts, respectively, of aluminate and silicate, calculated as Al₂O₃ and SiO₂, are such that the total amount thereof in the mixture is about 4 to 25 weight of the mixture, such that the Si Al gram atomic ratio in the mixture is about 1 1 to 10 1, and such that the amount, in the mixture, of at least one water soluble compound which is precipitable from the mixture at 10 to 100 C and which is inert to the alumi nate, silicate and poly alumino silicate is about 25 to 160 weight , based on the combined weights of aluminate and silicate, calculated as Al₂O₃ and SiO₂ and b the mixture is cooled to about 10 to 100 C until it is frozen, to separate substantially all of the chemically unbound water as substantially pure ice and to precipitate water soluble compound within the pores of the poly alumino silicate particles being formed.
