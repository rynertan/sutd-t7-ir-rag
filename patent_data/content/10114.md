# Steam reforming catalysts and their preparation.

## Abstract
Steam reforming catalysts, having good sinter and polymer resistance are provided which comprise a Group VIII metal such as nickel and alumina, have in the calcined but unreduced precursor form, pore size distributions defined in the following relationships i at least 55 of the pore volume of pores having a pore radius between 12 and 120 Angstron Units is in the range 12 30 Angstron Units, and ii the ratio of the pore volume contatned in pores of 10 50 Å to the pore volume contained in pores of 50 300 Å is at least 5. These catalysts are prepared by coprecipitation at tempera tures of not greater than 60 C wherein a solution of an alkali precipitating agent is added to a solution of the catalytic com ponents.
