# Process for manufacturing phosphorochloridothionates.

## Abstract
In the production of phosphorodichloridothionates difficulties are encountered in purification. In the known processes many impurities result. A multi step process is provided which leads to a substantially pure product. This process comprises chlorinating bis phosphorothioic sulphides, thioic acids, or salts thereof, distilling the reaction mixtures, contacting the distillate with a thioic acid or salt thereof, contacting the mixture with water and distilling the organic material after the water contacting. In a representative example dimethyl phosphorochloridothionate is prepared from dimethyl phosphorodithioic acid by chlorination, distillation, reaction of the thionate distillate with dimethyl phosphorodithioc acid to produce a semi pure thionate reaction mixture which is then contacted with water. The organic layer is then separated and distilled to product an over 99 pure product. The residue is recycled for reaction with the thioic acid in the first step of the process.
