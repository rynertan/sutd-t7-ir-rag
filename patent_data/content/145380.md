# ELECTRICAL APPARATUS FOR SURFACE AND PANEL MOUNTING

## Abstract
An electrical time switch has two relays 22 on a circuit board 20 with electrical connector blades 66 extending from it. A backplate 28 carrying cable connectors is provided with slots such that it can be fitted over the blades, making electrical connection between the cable connectors and the circuit board, with either face exposed. Thus the same backplate can be used for both wall mounting and panel mounting, whilst maintaining ease of access to the cable connectors for cable attachment. An optional unit 68 with a second pair of relays can be fitted on the circuit board and has additional blades for connection to the extra relays.
