# BACK PROJECTION IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
Image reconstruction time in a CT scanner is enhanced by using a pipeline structure and interpolation techniques to identify each detector for use in back projection of radia tion absorption measurements through each pixel in each view of the scanner. In a preferred embodiment, detectors are identified by calculation for a pixel in every third view with detectors for intermediate views obtained by interpola tion of the calculated detectors. Similarly, detectors are identified for every other pixel in a view with the detector for the intermediate pixel identified by interpolation.
