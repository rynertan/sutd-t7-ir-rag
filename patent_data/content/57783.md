# Method of making high capacity battery material.

## Abstract
A high capacity battery material is made by contacting a slurry of hydrated Ni OH â‚‚ containing alkali metal cations with an ozone air or ozone oxygen gas mixture, at a pressure over atmospheric, to form an ozonated material, consisting essentially of hydrated Ni II hydroxide, and 5 wt. to 40 wt. of Ni IV hydrated oxide interlayer doped with alkali metal cations selected from potassium, sodium and lithium ca tions.
