# A process for obtaining a package containing mutually reactive particulate materials and a package containing such materials.

## Abstract
A process for obtaining a package containing at least two mutually reactive materials comprises the steps of introduc ing the reactive materials into an envelope suitable for vacuum packing, placing the reactive materials within said envelope in separate layers with at least one intervening separating layer of a material which is inert relative to the adjacent layer of a reactive material, evacuating and sealing the envelope.
