## Description
Liquid crystal display device This invention relates to a liquid crystal display display device in which the alignment of liquid crystal molecules is prominently stabilized and which has an excellent contrast property. Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of the general field effect type liquid crystal display device. Referring to Fig. 1, a pair of front and back transparent electrode substrates 2, 3 are spatially set by a spacer 1 at a prescribed interval in a mutually facing state.A liquid crystal 4 is held between said transparent electrode substrates 2, 3. Polarizers 5, 6 are respectively fitted to the outer surface of the corresponding electrode substrates 2, 3. The electrode substrate 2 is formed of a glass substrate 7, transparent electrode 9 prepared from, for example, In203 or SnO2 and orientation treated film 11. The electrode substrate 3 is formed of a glass substrate 8, transparent electrode 10 prepared from, for example, In203 orSnO2 and orientation treated film 12. As used herein, the term orientation treated film is defined to mean that whose surface is so treated that the long axis of the molecules of the liquid crystal which are set in contact with said surface is orientated in a prescribed direction.The above mentioned surface treatment of the films 11, 12 is effected by rubbing their surface by cotton cloth in one direction. The orientation treatment direction of the film 11 defines an angle of about 900 with the orientation treatment direction of the film 12. The continuous displacement of the liquid crystal molecules between the film 11 and the film 12 defines an angle of about 900 in total, indicating the so called twisted alignment of the molecule simply referred to as a a twisted molecule alignment .The liquid crystal whose molecules show said twisted alignment has the so called rotatory polarization ability of rotating the oscillation face of an incident light through an angle of 900 along the twist of the molecule alignment. Where voltage is impressed across the electrodes 9, 10, then all the liquid crystal molecules therebetween are orientated in parallel with the direction of an electric field, causing the liquid crystal to lose the optical rotatory power. The lost or gain of the optical rotatory power of the liquid crystal means the passage or shut out of a light in the presence of a pair of polarizers 5, 6. This principle is utilized in the display device.The alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is twisted clockwise, as shown in Fig. 2A, from the front electrode substrate 2 having the orientation treatment direction 21 to the back electrode substrate 3 having the orientation treatment direction 22 as indicated by an arrow 23. Said liquid crystal molecule alignment is also twisted counterclockwise, as indicated inFig. 2B, from the front electrode substrate 2 having the orientation treatment direction 21 to the back electrode substrate 3 having the orientation treatment direction 22 as indicated by an arrow 24. ThroughoutFigs. 2A and 2B, reference numeral 20 denotes liquid crystal molecules. Where the clockwise twisted molecule alignment and the counterclockwise twisted molecule alignment jointly appear in a single liquid crystal display device, then an irregular display results. Therefore, the conventional practice of attempting to eliminate this drawback comprises causing the orientation treatment direction of one of the paired electrode substrates to define a smaller or larger angle than 900 with the orientation treatment direction of the other electrode substrate, thereby rendering either the clockwise or counterclockwise twisted molecular alignment more ready to appear in the liquid crystal display device. Indeed, the greater or smaller the displacement of the angle of the orientation directions than 900, the more fixed said twist direction.However, this process causes the oscillation face of a light to rotate through a smaller angle, leading to a decline in the contrast of a displayed pattern. With the conventional liquid crystal display device, the orientation treatment directions of the paired electrode substrates are set to define an angle of about 900 100 , that is, 800 or 1000, in order to assure improvement in the directional stability of the twisted molecular alignment. However, this process has been undertaken at the sacrifice of the contrast property of a liquid crystal display device. It is accordingly the object of this invention to provide a liquid crystal display device having a high directional stability of the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules and an excellent contrast property. To attain the above mentioned object, this invention provides a liquid crystal display device which comprises a pair of front and back electrode substrates between which a mixture of liquid crystals is held, those planes of said paired electrode substrates which contact the mass of mixed liquid crystals being so treated that the axis of liquid crystal molecules contacting said plane is orientated substantially in parallel therewith, and wherein said mixture includes a liquid crystal having a cyanophenylcyclohexane group represented by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein X is CnH2n lt Y is CN orEMI4.2 and the orientation treatment directions of both front and back electrode substrates are displaced from each other at a prescribed angle of 91 to 980 counterclockwise as viewed from the front electrode substrate side. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a field effect type liquid crystal display device Fig. 2A shows the clockwise twisted molecule arrangement Fig. 2B indicates the counterclockwise twisted molecule arrangement Fig. 3 graphically sets forth the relationship between the angles defined by the orientation treatment directions of a pair of electrode substrates used with the conventional liquid crystal display device on one hand, and the directional stability of the twisted molecule arrangement and the contrast property of a displayed pattern on the other and Fig. 4 graphically indicates the relationship between the angles, on one hand, defined by the orientation treatment directions of a pair of electrode substrates used with a liquid crystal display device embodying this invention which is provided with mixed liquid crystals, one of which has a phenylcyclohexane group, and the directional stability of the twisted molecule arrangement and the contrast property of a displayed pattern on the other. The present invention has conducted studies on the property of a liquid crystal material and the structure of a liquid crystal cell. As a result, it has been diselosed that where a liquid crystal display device is provided with mixed liquid crystals, at least one of which has a cyanophenylcyclohexane group represented by the formulaEMI5.1 wherein X is CnH2n 1t Y isCN orEMI5.2 and the orientation treatment angles of both front and back electrode substrates are displaced from each other through a prescribed angle of 910 to 980 counterclockwise as viewed from the front electrode substrate side, then said liquid crystal display device indicates a high directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment and an excellent contrast property of a displayed pattern.This invention has been accomplished from the above discovery. Liquid crystals having a cyanophenylcyclohexane group hereinafter referred to as PCH series liquid crystals include trans 4 ethyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane, trans 4 butyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane, trans 4 n pentyl 4 cyanobiphenyl 4 cyclohexane, trans 4 n pentyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane, trans n propyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane, and trans n heptyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane. As used herein, the term mixed liquid crystals as defined to mean a mixture of two or more liquid crystals added together to allow for the broadening of the range of the operating temperature of a liquid crystal display device and the control of the operating voltage thereof.Said mixed liquid crystals include a mixture of two or more PCH series liquid crystals, and a mixture of said PCH series liquid crystal and a different liquid crystal of, for example, the biphenyl or ester series.It is preferred that more than 50 by weight of thePCH series liquid crystal be contained in a mixture of said PCH series liquid crystal and another liquid crystal. Description is now given of a comparison between the excellent properties of a liquid crystal display device embodying this invention and the properties of the conventional liquid crystal display device.Fig. 3 graphically shows the relationship between the angles defined by the orientation treatment directions of a paired of electrode substrates used with the conventional liquid crystal display device on one hand and the directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment and the contrast property of a displayed pattern. Fig. 4 graphically indicates the relationship between the angles on one hand defined by the orientation treatment directions of a paired electrode substrates used with a liquid crystal display device embodying this invention which is provided with a liquid crystal mixture ZLI 1285 manufactured byMerck of West Germany and the directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment and the contrast property of a displayed pattern on the other.As used herein, the term the angle defined by the orientation treatment directions of a pair of electrode substrates is chosen to mean an angle measured from the orientation treatment direction of the front electrode substrate to that of the back electrode substrate counterclockwise, for example, in Fig. 2A said angle means an angle a measured from the orientation treatment direction 21 of the front electrode substrate to the orientation treatment direction 22 of the back electrode substrate counterclockwise. Throughout Figs. 3 and 4, curve A denotes the contrast property of a pattern indicated on the liquid crystal display device.Cuver A shows that where the orientation treatment directions of a paired electrode substrates are deflected from each other at an angle of 900, then the highest contrast property of a displayed pattern is assured and said contrast property gradually falls as said deflection angle increases or decreases from 900. Numerals given to the contrast property are counted with the contrast property at the 900 deflection expressed by 100 . The polarizing axis of a polarizer mounted on the outside of the electrode substrate is set in parallel with the orientation treatment direction of an electrode substrate contacted by said polarizer.Curve B in Figs. 3 and 4 represents the directional stability of the twisted molecule arrangement. Curve B in Fig. 3 shows that said directional stability falls to the lowest level when the aforesaid deflection indicates 900, namely, that the clockwise twisted molecule alignment and counterclockwise twisted molecule alignment are jointly appeared in a liquid crystal display device at the deflection angle of 90 . As the deflection angle is gradually removed from 900, the directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment is more improved. Said directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment gets substantially fixed at a smaller deflection angle than 830 and at a larger deflection angle than 970. In other words, the conventional liquid crystal display device failed to satisfy both the directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment and the contrast property of a displayed pattern. In the case of a liquid crystal display device embodying this invention which is provided with mixed liquid crystals, at least one of which is of the PCH series type, as shown in Fig. 4, the directional stability of the twisted molecule alignment falls to the lowest level at an angle of 850 and is gradually improved as the deflection angle is removed from 850 and is substantially fixed at a smaller deflection angle than 790 and a larger displacement angle than 910. Fig. 4 shows that with a liquid crystal display device embodying this invention wherein provided with mixed liquid crystals, one of which is of the PCH series type, the rotation angle of the oscillation face of a light can be drawn nearer to 900 than in the prior art liquid crystal display device, when an angle at which the orientation treatment directions of the paired electrode substrates are deflected from each other is chosen to range from 910 to 980, and further that a more stable twisted molecule alignment is assured. Where a mixture of liquid crystals includin thePCH series liquid crystal was formed of ZLI 1221 orZLI 1216 trade names of such mixed liquid crystals manufactured by Merck of West Germany , the same results as indicated in Fig. 4 were obtained. For reference, the mixed liquid crystals manufactured by Merck have the following compositions ZLI 1285 Trans 4 ethyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 20 Trans 4 butyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 25 4 cyano 4 ethylbiphenyl 15 4 cyano 4 n propoxybiphenyl 10 Trans 4 n pentyl 4 cyanobiphenyl 4 cyclohexane 20 Others remainderZLI 1221 Trans 4 n pentyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 30 Trans 4 n propyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 20 Trans 4 n pentyl 4 cyanobiphenyl cyclohexane12 Trans 4 n heptyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 10 Others remainderZLI 1216 Trans 4 n propyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 32 Trans 4 n pentyl 4 cyanophenyl cyclohexane 18 Others remainder The reason why the molecules of the PCH series liquid crystal of this invention indicate such behaviors as assure the previously described directional stability of molecule alignment and the satisfactory contrast of a displayed pattern is not yet fully understood.However, it is assumed that the long axis of the liquid crystal molecules contacting the paired electrode substrates is not set completely in parallel with the orientation treatment direction of said electrode substrates, and is somewhat inclined to the plane of said electrode substrates and consequently the PCH series liquid crystal have suchanisotropic characteristic that a molecule alignment tends to indicate a clockwise twisting as against the counterclockwise twisting. With the foregoing embodiment, the polarizing axes of polarizers were set in parallel with the orientation treatment direction of the electrode substrates. Where, however, the orientation treatment directions of the electrode substrates were chosen to jointly define an angle of 910 to 980, while an angle defined by the polarizing axes of the polarizers was set at 900, it was still possible to assure the directional stability of a twisted molecule arrangement and the satisfactory contrast of a displayed pattern. Generally speaking, mixed liquid crystals containing the PCH series type have a broader range of operating temperature and makes a quicker response than other liquid crystals free from said PCH series type, thus providing a liquid crystal display device having the previously mentioned excellent properties.
