# DRAIN SYSTEM FOR FUEL PROCESSOR APPARATUS

## Abstract
A drain system adapted for use in fuel processing devices, as well as in other fluid equipment applications, includes sensing means for detecting the presence of a predetermined quantity of water or other impurities sepa rated from the fuel, or the presence of other fluids, in an enclosure or container. Drain means are also included for discharging at least a substantial portion of the predeter mined quantity in response to said detection of the presence thereof. The drain means is preferably actuated and deactua tion by automatic control means in order to maintain said water or other impurities, or said other fluids, at or below the predetermined quantity. The fuel processing device herein further includes means for heating fuel in order to prevent fuel waxing and clouding. Several embodiments are de scribed which are particularly useful for treating fuel as it is transmitted to an engine or other consuming device whereas another embodiment describes a fuel processing device particularly adapted for treating fuel as it is drawn from and returned to the fuel tank.
