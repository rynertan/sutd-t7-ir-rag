# OPTICAL SENSOR AND TRANSDUCER ARRAY SYSTEM

## Abstract
An optical transducer with an optical waveguide having two paths for the propagation of light is deformed in response to acoustical pressure variations or other parameters to be sensed to modulate the amplitude of the light propagated along the two paths in opposite polarities. The light outputs of the two paths are sensed by photodetectors and applied to an electrical differencing circuit. The mean values of the photo detector outputs are balanced as by mechanically providing a predetermined bias deformation of the fiber, or by electrically matching outputs of the detectors such that, on the average, the output of the differencing circuit is zero. Dynamic defor mation of the fiber in the transducer results in unbalanced outputs of the photodetectors which unbalance is sensed by the differencing circuit. This differential detection method minimizes optical and mechanical sources of noise in the light source and waveguide and leads to increased signal to noise and enhanced dynamic range of the transducer. An array of optical waveguide transducers, especially suitable for use in a multi channel hydrophone seismic streamer, contains optical waveguides which are deformed in response to the parameter being sensed underwater acoustic energy in the case of the seismic streamer . Two optical sign als are obtained from each transducer, amplitude modulated in opposite polarity in accordance with the parameter and returned to a collection point by way of optical signal high ways, such as optical fiber waveguides. The optical signals are time division multiplexed on the return highways by suc cessively providing light pulses to each of the transducers upon activation of separate light sources associated therewith which are electrically activated by electrical signals propa gated along a transmission line wherein the electrical signals are successively delayed. The optical signals on the return waveguides appear in time slots corresponding to the succes sive delays and may be sequentially interrogated at a rate compatable with the frequency response of the array system. At the collection point, the outputs of the return waveguides are subtracted thereby summing the optical signals from each transducer, while reducing noise introduced into the system as may be due both to variations in the amplitude of the light from the sources and mechanically due to deformation or bending of the optical waveguides other than in response to the parameter being sensed.
