# Method and mixture for producing cellulosic pulps.

## Abstract
A method is provided for selectively defiberizing and delignifying lignocellulose employing an alkaline pulping sys tem. The pulping system comprises lignocellulose and a pulp ing liquor comprising water, a water miscible organic reag ent, and a sulphide or bisulphide compound selected from alkali metal sulphides and bisulphides, ammonium sulphide and ammonium bisulphide. Pulping the system at an elevated temperature makes possible extremely high pulp yields as compared to kraft pulping.
