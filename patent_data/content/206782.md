# PROCEDURE AND APPARATUS FOR REMOVING VOLATILE SUBSTANCE FROM WATER DURING DISTILLATION OR EVAPORATION

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a procedure for removing volatile substances from water when distilling or evaporating water. The water to be purified, when it is feed water for a distilling apparatus 10 , is heated to a high enough tem perature or distillate or water to be evaporated or that has been evaporated and which already is at a high enough tem perature is conducted into a vessel 31, 31a communicating at it s top end with ambient air. Pure air is conducted into the same vessel 31, 31a so that water and air are flowing in said vessel 31, 31a in opposite directions. The pure air is arranged to discharge in the lower part of said vessel 31, 31a through a dispersing means 33, 33a in the form of microbubbles into the water and to carry along with it the harmful substances present in the water, whereby said harmful substances depart from the water by evaporation. The invention is furthermore concerned with apparatus for performing the procedure.
