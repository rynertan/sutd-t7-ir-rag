# CONTINUOUS BIOREACTOR AND PROCESS

## Abstract
An improved bioreactor and process for continuously propagating microorganisms, such as yeast, wherein the culture medium is purified in contact with a spirally wound ultrafiltration membrane and then passed through the outer surfaces of a tubular membrane material for further purifica tion before contact with microorganisms flowing in the in terior of the tubular membrane material.
