## Description
MODIFIED ALLERGENS This invention relates to a process for preparing modified allergens, to modified allergens that may be prepared by that process, and to the use of the modified allergens in the therapy of allergic humans. Many people are allergic to allergenic materials such as pollens, weeds and house dust. Such allergies have been conventionally treated by the administration to the sufferer of repeated gradually increasing doses of the relevant allergen, to build up resistance to the allergen. This is known as desensitisation. In our U K Patent No 1 282 163 is described one improved form of therapy, in which the allergenicity of a give allergen is reduced by treatment with glutaraldehyde. It is found that such material maintains its ability to stimulate the desired blocking antibody, and thus may be used in desensitisation therapy with a reduced risk of side effects. An alternative approach to the problem is the modification of the allergen such that on administrat ion it suppresses the production of IgE antibodies specific to the unmodified allergen. Such an approach is described in Dutch Patent Application No. 7 709 025 now also published as U.K. Patent No. 1 578 348 , wherein it is stated that allergen polyethylene glycol conjugates are capable of eliciting the therapeutically desirable effect of suppressing in particular allergen specific IgE production. These materials are also stated to be substantially non allergenic and nonimmunogenic. It should be noted that although in this DutchPatent Application it is suggested that other polymers such as polyvinylalcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyacrylamides and homopolymers of amino acids may be used in place of polyethylene glycol, only polyethylene glycols are illustrated. In copending published European PatentApplication No 0038154 it is reported that allergens modified with polysarcosine have the ability to suppress the production of IgE antibodies specific to unmodified allergen. A process for preparing certain polysarcosine modified allergens has now been discovered which differs from the processes described in the saidEuropean Patent Application. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing a polysarcosine modified allergen, which process comprises binding the polysarcosine to the allergen, characterised in that the polysarcosine is reacted in the form of a compound of formula I EMI2.1 wherein R is a C16 alkyl group, preferably methyl, n is 1 or 2, B is a hydrocarbon chain of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, optionally containing a double bond, and the polysarcosine is bound through its N terminus. When n is 1, the RS O n moiety becomes RSO . When n is 2, the RS O , moiety becomes RS02 . This reaction may be carried out in conventional manner known for binding molecules to allergens, which methods are based on reacting active groups on the molecules with active groups on the allergens, and if necessary or convenient providing such active groups as a first step. The allergen is preferably in the form of an extract of whole allergen, as is conventional. Suitable whole allergens from which the extract can be obtained include pollens, such as grass pollens, for example rye weeds, such as ragweed house dust mites venoms, such as bee venom. Often the whole allergen will be ragweed, or a mixture of grasses, preferably a mixture of grasses. Examples of B include CH2 , CH2 CH2 , C CH3 C CH3 and CH CH . Preferably B is CH2 CH2 . The polysarcosine for use in the process of this invention may have any convenient molecular weight.However, we have found that polysarcosine of molecular weight in the range 2000 to 12000 is suitable, more suitably 2000 to 9000. Polymers of molecular weight in this range are commercially available, but of course can be synthesised in conventional manner if desired or necessary. When used herein in relation to polysarcosine, molecular weights are number average molecular weights. It will be appreciated by the skilled man that each allergen molecule will have a number of suitable sites for binding of polysarcosine molecules. It will be a routine matter for the skilled man, now we have discovered the advantages obtained thereby, to determine by simple experiment suitable binding levels for different allergens and different molecular weight polysarcosines to give the desired activity IgE suppression . The degree of allergen substitution in the reaction can generally be controlled by addition of different amounts of activated polysarcosine. The compounds of formula I are themselves novel, and therefore form a further aspect of the present invention. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by the oxidation of a compound of formula it EMI4.1 wherein R and B are as defined in formula I . This oxidation may suitably be carried out using excess hydrogen peroxide in glacial acetic acid. Other mild oxidising agents may also be used, for example, 3chloroperoxy benzoic acid. Depending on reaction conditions, a mixture containing variable proportions of compounds of formula I wherein n is 1 and n is 2 can be produced. By restricting the amount of oxidising agent used, for example, to one equivalent, the compound of formula I wherein n is 1 will predominantly be produced The compounds of formula II may be prepared by coupling polysarcosine to a compound of formula III EMI5.1 wherein R and B are as defined in formula I . This reaction may suitably be carried otby any of the conventional methods known in peptide chemistry, which usually involve activation of the acid function.In our hands one convenient procedure is to use hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Also of course, other activated esters may be prepared using the appropriate percursor, for example 4 nitrophenol or pentafluorophenol, in conjunction with a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide, particularly, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The compounds of formula III may be prepared by coupling an acid HOOC B COOH to a compound of formula IV EMI6.1 wherein R is as defined in formula I . This reaction again can be carried out in conventional manner, which can conveniently involve using the acid in the form of an anhydride, such as succinic anhydride. When using a dicarboxylic acid of formulaHOOC B COOH in the preparation of compounds of formula III selective reaction of one only of the acid groups will be achieved using one equivalent of the compound of formula CHIV together with a suitable condensing agent, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4,4dimethylaminopyridine. The process of this invention is believed to have useful advantages. For example, it is believed that a minimum of polysarcosine may be used in the reaction due to the high coupling efficiency leading to a low level of polysarcosine loss. Also, it is believed that this process can yield materials having high levels of polysarcosine binding to the allergens. Further, it is believed that this process can yield modified materials having a low level of retained allergenicity. The polysarcosine modified allergens when prepared by the process of this invention are novel and form an important aspect of this invention. In such materials preferably the allergen is mixed grass, B is CH2CH2and usefully the polysarcosine has a molecular weight of about 2000. The modified allergens of this invention suppressIgE production specific to the unmodified allergen. They may therefore be used in the therapy of allergy in humans. For example, if a patient is allergic to ragweed, then a modified allergen according to this invention in which the allergen is ragweed would be used. The modified allergens of the present invention may be employed as the active agents in compositions such as vaccines. Such compositions are well known to those skilled in the art and comprise a sterile liquid vehicle in which the active agent is dissolved or suspended. If suspended, the particles of active agent should be small enough not to block the orifice of an injection needle. Certain additives such as tyrosine are often included in such compositions and are believed to provide a support and prolonged slow release of native matetial in vivo. Usually a patient receiving treatment with such a composition is administered a number of injections, spread over a period of weeks or days. It is also believed that the modified allergens of the invention may be active via other routes of administration, such as the nasal mucosa, when administration can be as a liquid spray or as a dry powder. A preferred composition of this invention is as a vaccine. The composition of this invention may, by way of illustration, suitably contain 1 to 10000 P.N.U. of modified material. Normally, of course, doses towards the lower end of this scale will be more suitable for early in the therapy doses towards the higher end of this scale for later in the therapy.
