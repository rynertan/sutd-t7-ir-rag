# METHOD OF ENCAPSULATING FINELY DIVIDED SOLID PARTICLES AND STABLE SUSPENSIONS PREPARED THEREBY

## Abstract
Finely divided water insoluble solid particles free of ionic charge, of about 0.01 µm upward, for example paint pigments, are uniformly encapsulated by admixing them, in an aqueous medium, with a water insoluble monomer poly merizable to form a water insoluble polymer free of ionic charge, in the presence of a non ionic surface active sta biliser, preferably a polyethoxylated alkyl phenol at least C₈ alkyl and preferably at least 40 50 EO groups , and then initiating polymerization, usually with heating, with a redox system free of anionic groups. Naturally agglomerated par ticulate materials are effectively dispersed in situ during polymerization, thus eliminating preliminary grinding and or dispersion. Normal emulsion polymerisation conditions may be used, with usual emulsion polymerization mono mers free of ionic groups. The product is a suspension of polymer encapsulated discrete particles exhibiting remark able stability against flocculation or settling. White paint pigments, e.g. TiO₂, thus encapsulated exhibit increased hiding power, and colored pigments exhibit greater bril liance and color depth in dried paint films. In both cases, the film has improved abrasion resistance, and improved stain resistance due to reduced porosity, as compared with con ventional latex paints.
