# A terminal for electrical resistance heating element and a method for the manufacture of such terminals.

## Abstract
A terminal for electrical resistance heating elements, comprising a thin, resistance thread of a highly temperature resistant material, particularly MoSiâ‚‚, which at at least one end thereof has a lead in electrode of a material having a better conductivity than that of the resistance heating element and having a greater cross sectional area than that of the resistance thread. The terminal 10 comprises an outer thin walled sheat ing 12 of stainless steel, one end of which is shaped as a sleeve 13 and the other end which is flattened into a flat connecting tongue 14 having a bore 15 . The sheating 12 contains a filling 16 of alumina wherein one end of the resistance thread 11 is molten in.
