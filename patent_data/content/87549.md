## Description
A DESCRIPTION OF THE INDUSTRIAL INVENTION, HAVINGAS A TITLE A HYDROSTATIC,ENGINE FOR THE EXPLOI TATION OF THE HIGH AND THE LOW TIDE AND THE HYDRODINAMIC OF THE WATERCOURSE . The structure the devise and the building of the mechanics razionality of the prototype shown they point out their originality for the development of the application of some of the phisics laws, with a particular care the hydrostatic.The mechanic complex fondamentaly riflects appli que work in a rational way of a compulsory phisic law, with particular care the hidrostatic. The nexilaustible source of energy is equiped by a tural phenomenon, of the high and low tide and of the hydrodinamic of the water courses.The beginning of its motor action, begins from, . the exploitation of the total weight of the water of which the note law of ARCHIMEDE. . . . . To clarify what I am to assert, an esamination ca se comes out to show an easy an more exhaustive l dimonstration, and so that, the utility of a water source, such as a river, or a stream ect.. The cylinder efficiency offered by nature, due to the transfer of the water from the mountain to the vally, or from the high and low tide. The natural water flowing is a cylindar energy, .and with a proper transformation system, it becamen motor functional. To transform the mechanic efficancy of a water flow and obtain the strength to exploit the shaft, the difference in hight is enough in a short stre tch of its course, of only a few maters. The developable power is directly proportional to the reach of the water course to its volmetric statement in the time employed for the imminent supplies. In order to carry out the accomplishement of the prototype in exploitation of a water cour se, is necessary condition the availability along its course, of a long adapter which hlps the building of a lake A.1 for the 50 of the water I gathering of the running needes, in the time used by a special floater B.3 to end its cycle in de scent. The function of the basin A.1 is of a feeder, which consents the yielding flow to the mantainment of the constant level in the big basin A.2, of pro portioned dimention to its erogation for the car ry out of the installation, and replace the run off of the pressing caused by the floater B.3 in the basin A.2, during the ascent fase, conforming to decreasing of the push relation, for the begin ning of the communicated vessels,The basin A.l described above, must be built for the laterally convenience of the water course ser ved with a insertion mesh regolable by a shutter. The side A.55 of the basin A.2, must be built near ly atteched to the basin A.1, in a defluent manner, to consent with facility the passing of the water through the input window A.4 of wich flow in an finished ascent fase is purposly interrupted at the same shutter valve. The basin A.2 of which we have already talked, is basin shaped like a swimming pool ,that is t say, with perimetral walls and the base pavement made of concreat. Apart from the vantage which shows the finding in itself, its razionality con struction is very much presented for a numer of constructions after its first implantation of the same type, which work indipendently from one ano ther using the same water.And at this distance g to its perimiter and perpendicular in the center, framed in beams, a big prismatic plank A. 6 is put, 1 its dimention must be such to hold, together with the stand still of the supports A.56 click laterals, the weight of the floater B.3 in discendent fase. Its wrapping as it was said befor, has the dimen tions and the symetry proportioned to the basin A.2. In its construction it must be taken on account of the structure to realise a hollow space A.7 with an equidistance to the wall. of the basin A.2, of a few centimiters, to favour in the shortest time the filling and the completement of the le vil which gives the go to the push. The floater B.3 is helf from the sides by guide A.8 by equilibrium in uplyfting and in the decent, framed at the corners. The plank A.6 erected in the enter of the base A.9 of the basin A.2, at the hight of point A.54 in which it will begin, the run of the ascent and for the duration of it, it is provided of a transverse denture A.10. It crossed the floater from the base to the top, by means of a tubolar passage B.11 of the same si ze which serves also as a guide. The prismatic guideB.11 is of a tin seal, at its endings, of the high side, it is provided by a strong bridge E.16, of which covering gear E.12 of a cilinder shape, expected to put in gear with the denture A.10 on the plank. At the ascent or descent movment of the t loater B.3, called gear E,12 is oblidood to flow lon the denture of it E.12, effecting some round about on it self.At the two endings of the plankE.13 of the denture wheel, destined to an engine, and with which make a sole body, it takes two joi ned pulleys E.14 15 for each side therefore such pulleys E.14 15, carries out as a destination the same rotation, acting in the two rotations the same service with an alterated destination for a simplier dimostration, let s take the floater B.3 shown at the three cubes superimposed A abc.To obtain a useful running, as it was said befor, it is necessary to divide the total void as follows The basic cube B c, apart of acting as a balance to the structure, it must stoe ballast to keep together with the second cube B b a balanced immer sion line, corrisponding t9 the emergence of the base of the third cube A b because the total gross tonnage weight of the two cubes B c, must devoid the equivalent to the capacity in the weight volum of water which moves the third cube B a. It is ovious to prouve as the levil of the water in the basin A.2 increse, the floater B 3 left alone, its flpating law follows. Otherwise, if we put to restraint the such called I floater 3.3, and higher the water level in the ba sin A.2, it prints on it the principle of Archime des, a push from downwords to upwords equal to the displaced volum of water. As a riflex, in the flow of the tide, a craft treatment in the posi tion of an end reflow, at the moment in which it comes to be let free from the hold at the maximum point of the flow, it recives a push from downwords to upwords, always with a decrescent power.As a movment reflex, a phisicomechanic phenomenon hap pens, at the moment in which the floater B.3, af ter having reached the decid upper point and stopped in a such position, having ended the reflow, the gravity weight of the total gross tonnage, it impresses the run of the motor gearing E.12 showing a power development with an wqual inten sity at the start. hile the floater B.3 will dip in the basin A.2, it is thrown away from the wat drain A.5, the water which it displaced for the immersion effect of its loaded wrapping of the ballast, which in the beginning was used for the support to adjust the ascendnet push.The floater B.3 of the resting state to the decid, down point is ready to give a start to the ascention, but A.5 for such inertia the shutting of the shutter must come first, or the discharge valve and the conseguent opening of that of the insertion A.4. It is to point out that the residual water level with the floater at the lower ,dead point must touch the low side of the delimitated base of the third cube A.a. After the contemporal.opening o the valve A.4 of the immersion, as soon as the water fullfills the level of the full of the hol low space of the immersion valve A.2, the floaterB.3 is the condition to let out all its push power.The cardinal point is the total exploitation of the powerfull force which springs by hydrostatic.The floater B.3 by now it shows its push power, the exptoitation is not pratical of its strength, because of the short time which takes An the trash vers, and because of the decrescent print, it is not easy to translate in convinient rendering work such movment. With my device, I understood to surround te obstacle, happily exceeding the difficul ty, after having sharpened my knowledge for the realization of a mechanic accumulator H.15, which has the power of possessing instantly the hold of.the push power, even if its decrescent an suddenlyIn the paragraph befpr, it has been described in a scanty way, that to translate the cinetic in po tenzial mechanic in the case in examination, it traS made necessary the ausiliar of the mechanisme of the cilinder E.12 which acts as an intermediant suitable for the developent of an automatic ac tion of the fixing of the floater B.3 in its movments with simile to the oscillent pern of the scale, in so far as soon it passes the water level in the basin, it has the maximum push power provocated by the automatic loss of balance of the balance.At this point, the recover divice gets in action at the accumulater, because it has come to determinate a strong change of potenzial mechanic energy. The cilindric gear E.12, pushed by the floater B.3, will effect the flowing on the plank denture performing circular rolls on it self in relation of its circonference dimention. Such gear E.12 is built on support E.16, like a bridge as it was said, and it formes a sole body with its plank E.13, which goes further its side pin cushionsE.17. Facing the extension of each side, a plateE.18 is well fixed on which are well fixed on each of them E.18 19, two big dimencions E.14 14.pulleys. It is understood, that the push which the floater B.3 little by little puts out of the basinA.2 decrese the intensity proportionatly to the report of the loss of its void in the immesion therefor it is made necessary to operate a recove ry of the descent power. To advantage better the total power recovery systim, it is made necessary and only, the application of pulleys and spirals with variable pace E.14.To give a clear dimonstration, the variable pace of the pulleys consits of E.14 in the creation of the circonference in an asimetric spiral at the curvilinear at the Archimedes spiral. It is necessare to do a compleat explanation and clear its concept As it is of a service of an equivalen evolution of a progressive automatic change, which in this present case it changes the wing power stationery and uncontested the value of the resi stence. This is possible due to the short rotation which covers the dental wheel, which it wears out nearly in only a round.For this purpous a pulley has been created which has the charateristcs a first kind level function, while the ray decre se consists that the fulcrum will near the resi stence to light off the decrescent power, so it keeps the result with much delay and with delayed movment of the push of the floater B.3 to the re sistence H.15. From such concept, I took out the deductions neces sary of creativity with the ending of a happy so lution. The function of the four pulleys E.14 which have the iniziytive to perform the whelling of the draught at the tie rod, enveloping the re lative ropes on turn, It remaines still and inva riable the impressed value of the power to win the resistance of the opposition. The spiral pulleryE.14 has an asimmetric circonference, with a decre scent shape to its ray, following a curve line a spiral which will have as a conjunction spot the base of the departure ray or to continue helicoi diarly if the case will require it. The pilleys E.14 15 is held at loth end on the plank E.13 of the motor gear .12, performing . their cpnf ormitv rotation to the crauler wheel E.12.The structure of their circonference, is the same for all four, but it is divided in two corrisponding couples, at the intent to perform, in how it wasEMI10.1 alternate productive rotations.Being their dispositions opposite, which help the rotation movement of the entanglement in one way or an other, the result of the decrescent push of the floater B.3 is ended at the accumuesterior out of the maximum ray of its circonfe rence, in a draught position, at the center of the race E.19 which serves also as a guide, of how it was intended ansipating the descrition, a iron rope C.20, having its lenght nearly the same as its dentured multilink C.21, chain will be attached. As the rotatory iniziative of the pulleys E.14 15 is transmitted by the motor gear E.12, their movement devaid destination is addressed near the oppo site side of the gorge E.19, in this may a wheeling of a tie rod traction occurs. While the robes C.20 gradualy go in their rispective gorges E.19 following the decrescent ray, it mantains a constant tension to win the resistance till the end of the totation.The two couples of pullsys E.14 15 are put in a way that, while the couple E.14 wirids the ropeC.20 with a chain C.21, the other couple extends helped by the call of the pendicular C.22,which lies at its ends. When the motor gear E.12 begins the rotation in o ne way, the two pulleys E.14 opposite equidisance, divided for each side, corrisponding to the same t tension ray, maintaining the exact balance to the cilinder gear E.12 because it is helped by the sen se of the shelter drive of the prismatic plank so the two ropes C.20 which make head to each ray, act conseguently. The two pullies E.14 while they wrap their rispective ropes C.20, the gorge E.19 of each acts as an accommodation guide in this way it allows a rod traction of the chains C.21, which penetrates in the two gears corrisponding to the quintiplette D.25, obligint them to wheel in the wanted sense. In the same way the of the rotation occurs the deviation of the rotation. While the pulling action of the two ropes E.14 stops at the end of the race, the oder two pulleys E.15 fitted in the opposite way are already in a pulling psoition. The alternative movement of the ropes, performed by the two couples of the pulleys E.14 E.15 is different only in the fixing of the antithesis of one in comparison to the other.In conclusion of what we have said, the pulleys E.14 in the decrescent circonference ray, which forms a spiral, contents the constant power trasmission of the decrescent push of the floaterB.3, with a rhythm corrisponding to the action, with with the condition the, the iniziative is unicaly devolved to the pulleys E.14 15. In other words with the use of such pulleys E.14 it si manifested a constant and uniform delay of the power at the accumulation H.15, until reaching point zero of the race, assuming in this way the function of a progressive multiplier. The two couples of ,the pulleys E.14 15 how we ha ve ,already said, have alternate movements, and that is to say that while a couple reacts at the pull the other opposit couple stretches on acco unt of the calling of the weight which loads at the pendolums C.22 attached to their ends. The gears D.23 24 which recive the machinery ac tion of the dentured chains to the tie rods, drag ging in rotation the fifth gear D.28 centraley fixed, which make part in solid and primary to their group. Such gear D.28 of strong proportions, with a chain drive C. or in couple, the proncipal gear action H.57 of the winch H.29 fixed on a sold suitble base, which has the work to drag till the top of the proper level ground H.30, fixed by a mass of ballast on flowis H.6O, to easy the drag and les sen the friction of the svirament. The resistance to pass the winch H.29, must result nearly the sa me as the value of the push of the floater B.3. The fifth gear D.28 of the quintiple group is compleat with approphiate blockage denteurs, to consent tbe rhythmic gradual push of the accumula tor mass H.15.The push of the floater B.3 can end in a very short time, in correlation to the support flow of the water of the basin. It remains there at the lower or upper dead point until the compleat level of the full or of the emptyness of the gap in the basin A.2. This states, the floater B.3 remaines pointed on the gear E.12 dentured on the prismatic plank un til it doesn t pass the bascule the strain of the push the resistance of the accumulator mass H.15, equal to the working action of a scale. The rota tory action of the cilinder ge r E.12, is trasmit ji ted with all its whole integraty, at the call of the winch H.29 which drags the level ground H.30 to the fixed point. At the time in which the opposition power becomes insufficent to the assorbi ment of all the floater push power one has to multiply proportionly the report for the moving of the accumulator mass. If my idea is not mustahen,the most suitable me thod of accumulation and additional consequent of the power for the repation of the action, has been chosen from a particular analisis. According to my concinction, the thesis has been made valid in order to be able to accumulate a power of wide proportions, of which effects will end in quite a short time, it is indispensable the auxiliar of a mechanic accumulator H.15 with the capasity of immediate recovery. Such accumulator H.15 must consent the acquited power accumulent, usible 1 then with mesured circumspection of exploitation.Infact I took as a comparable indes the balance movement of the scale, for the creation of a sui take accumulation device H.15. The drawing of the accumulater mass H.30 of the shoped ballast, is effected by a winch H.29 on a slanting flush with a large shope, so that, after having reached the preveley fixed distance, the towing rope H.31 will automaticaly loase it self from the vice H.47 of the winche H.29 and the level ground H.15 rimains held by the rope H.31 al ready envelopedto the main pulley H.33, assisted by the adiacent tentichain, so that the slope will go down along the gravity skididng, until the star ting shock absorber repellents point with convinien tly controlled accelaration. In the case in which the winch H.29 will not come out suitable to the towing because of the big ballast mass H,30, a re couse to the adaption of the mobil pulley is ne cessary. While the svirament accurs, the main pulley H.33 with its click denterurs drag the metal plateH.35 with a binoculas clutch, impressing it motier power to it and trasmits all the power which it takes on, balanced, if necessary by a centrifugal espansion. This done, only one mass certainly gives the interruption of the productive cycle, and that is the ability of the coupling of another mass at a parallelle action, with an alternative function, commanded by the same winch H.29 at the same time of the release of the vice of the I towing of the first wing of the winch 37, the circuit will automaticaly close the G.40 hydraulic hold of the second wing, in this way the to l wring of the second mass H.15 begins with eouipol lent development at the firs wing H.37. While at the first mass H.15 it discends the slo pe, the other parallelly H.15 is in an ascent fase. In the case in which it will not render sufficentlx in time, the total race for an adegua ted productive exploitment, because of the scarse capacity volumetric course of the water flow, a recourse to abinate another installation is dome to make consecutivly use of the same water. The same device is used for the explatation of the tide it is said that,the installation for such use is more semplificyed it its structure than that of the water corses in a particular way if they are in use on intented coasts, near a gulf, in other way in a Place, where it resents less the influence of the billows. I did not deepened and I didn t go in the particulars of a prototype of a building character, because the thisis, till now treated in its complex of a more semDlifyed twin costruction because it hasen t got any pro blem of imminent flood tide which helps the exploi tation at a sudden action. The winch H.29 used for the recovery o the power, it is a special winch above all it is suitable for the alternate towing. It has been structured with two wings H.37 37e, it is fixed the intermit tent transport of the level ground H.30, on which a mass is ìxed agglomerated with ballast of crete. Every winch wing is costitiuted of three planks H.37 38 8 fixed to U., for all their lenght elicor dalment bordered with pace F.61 at a rectangular section on service at a multyplied tangent screw, which forms groups with dentured geared crowns .G.44. The crowns G.44 are fixed on an oscillant i wing G.50 having as an oscillant pin G.46 the bordered plank. Their work is to trasmit through the plank G.45 the coupleing of the crowns G.44 held by the oscellent support the rotary motion at the holding corrisponding pulleys H.47.All the pulleys H.47 in number 19 for the three wings, work in concomitnce on the iron hope H.31, which finds place in their respective gorge. Zhe pressure G.39 for the hydraulic seizing, op portunatly eserscised on the planks consent,the tightening of the seizing with prestabilised move mentautocomanded, with the specificated intent to move the pull of the big iron rope H.31, slightly faulty to help win the resistence of the radiant friction of the towing. The burning argument for a big system of big dimantions, which convrs big portions characters and one must use a sofisticat ted techneque because of the effort in which it will be subjected It is necessary to structure a tackle elaborated in its minimum particulars.Being a mechanism in which pins the developments of the precedent discussions, It was beleved to adoperate a system which disimplyes a work pract tamently mechanic, which consents a happy ending of the thisis till now used. For one notion the structure of a winch as we intended beforhand, it will be integrated of a senoirs of accessory organs in an instalmemt of a very big dimention. Passed the problem of the structure, an argument of great interest and the desplacment of the twing rope H.31 which will assume a conveniently simmetry in the shape a crown. The chose of the principle on which the unurnding of the towing is used, has a determinate value. The big rope H.31, of which ends ties H.48 a bilanced side fixed to the level ground, goes on to tile slides H.49 at rolls on the ground, enve loping.at the maint pulleyH.33 gorge at the ends of the slopea tentichain is put in the pulley gor ge H.34, than it goes on to that one of the guide at the upper corner .H.52, it is laid on tile flo wing rolls supplied H.49, until it reaches the first wing of the pulling pulleys H.37 than con tinuing on the second H.38 and on the third wing H.58, by means of the guide pulleys at the lower corners favoured by Lhe trasmition of the corne red conics gears which trasnits the movment until the passivly join the side low part H.51 of the ground betters the rendering of the complex in consideration to its lenght. The intent is quite clear, it passes the problem of the tangling of a non common size of rope, as well as the duration of the same and partly deter mains the balance for the compensation to the loss of power for passiv frictions. Ended the rotation which the implantment needs, tkle svirament accurs to effect the analogue complex of the service repe tition. I intended compleating the thesis with dimostrative graphics of which on Fig. A B C D E F G H presently wholy described is clearly described of henonim and movments to distinguish. The subjects till now used shows us congecture conclusions which refelects a very strict yoh of creativity onnected to the phisic laws sometimes espositions which shows syllogism.
