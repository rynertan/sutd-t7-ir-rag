## Description
This invention relates to laminated printing blankets, and to a method of manufacturing such blankets. The type of blanket referred to herein is compressible, and is used primarily in offset lithographic printing, but may also find utility in other fields of printing. The use of blankets in offset lithography is well known and has a primary function of transferring ink from a printing plate to paper. Printing blankets are very carefully designed so that the surface of the blanket is not damaged either by the mechanical contact of the blanket with the parts of the press, or by chemical reaction with the ink ingredients. Repeated mechanical contacts cause a certain amount of compression of the blanket which must be within acceptable limits so that the image is properly reproduced. It is also important that the blanket have resiliency, that is, be capable of returning to its original thickness, and that it provide constant image transfer regardless of the amount of use to which it is put. Printing blankets are normally composed of a substrate base material which will give the blanket integrity. Woven fabrics are preferred for this base. The base may consist of one, two, three, or more layers of fabric. The working surface, by which is meant the surface that actually contacts the ink, is usually an elastomeric layer, which may be made of natural or synthetic rubber, which is applied over the base layer. This is usually done by calendering or spreading rubber in layers until a desired thickness of rubber has been deposited, after which the assembly is cured or vulcanized to provide the finished blanket. Such a blanket is acceptable for many applications, but often lacks the necessary compressability and resiliency needed for other applications. It is desirable, therefore, to produce more highly compressible blankets having improved resiliency. It is difficult to obtain an improved compressibility factor by the standard construction described above because the rubber material, while it is highly elastomeric, is not volume compressible, and cannot be compressed in a direction at right angles to its surface without causing a distortion or stretch of the blanket in areas adjacent to the point of compression. Therefore, if irregularities exist in the printing plate, the presses, or the paper, the compression to which the blanket is exposed will vary during the printing operation, and the irregularities in the plates, presses, and paper will be magnified by the lack of compression in the printing blanket. It has been found that by including at least one layer of material comprising a compressible layer of resilient polymer in a printing blanket, printing problems such as those described above, as well as blurring lack of definition , caused by a small standing wave in the blanket printing surface adjacent to the nip of the printing press, can be avoided. Also, a compressible layer can serve to absorb a smash , that is a substantial deformation thereof caused by a temporary increase in the thickness in the material to be printed, for example by the accidental introduction of more than one sheet of paper, or the like, during the printing operation. By incorporating a compressible layer in the blanket, a smash can be absorbed without permanent damage to the blanket, and without impairment of the printing quality of the blanket. In addition, a resilient compressible layer helps to maintain the evenness of the printing surface and the thickness of the blanket after compression at the nip of the press. Many different means of producing a compressible layer within a printing blanket are known in the art. For example, compressible layers have been formed by mixing granular salt particles with a polymer used to produce the layer, and thereafter leaching the salt from the polymer to create voids. Voids in the compressible layer permit positive displacement of the surface layer without distortion of the surface layer, since volume compression occurs and displacement of the surface layer takes place in the direction of the voids, substantially perpendicular to the impact of the press. Other methods of creating a compressible layer, such as using blowing agents, and compressible fiber structures, have been used in the prior art. For example, it is known in the art to produce a compressible printing blanket by adding and mixing particles of hydrated magnesium sulphate in the elastomeric matrix of the layer, creating a blowing effect, and leaching the particles from the matrix, thus producing a compressible layer which has cavities which are interconnected by passages, as is disclosed by Haren et al, in US A 4,025,685. In the prior art methods, the forming of the voids using blowing agents, for example, has the disadvantage that the size of the voids formed, and the interconnecting of the voids, is not easily controlled. Oversized voids and interconnected voids cause some areas of the printing blanket to be more compressible and less resilient than adjacent areas of the printing blanket, which results in deformations during printing. Also, the gases produced by the blowing agents sometimes wick or leak into the surface layer or into the base layer of the blanket, thereby weakening or affecting the quality of the printing blanket. One method that has been proposed to alleviate this problem is to apply pressure to the compressible layer as it is being formed, as is disclosed by Rodriguez, in US A 4,303,721. The method and construction described by Rodriguez, however, are relatively expensive to use. Also, the need for a grinding step after the foaming of the nitrile rubber makes the method described by Rodriguez labor intensive. It should also be noted that DE B 1 165 046 relates to a printer s blanket having an intermediate compressible layer therein. Voids are formed in the compressible layer by the use of a blowing or expanding agent in the composition which expands to form cells or voids during vulcanization of the blanket. Apparently, all of the layers of the blanket are assembled, and then the entire construction is cured, with the formation of cells or voids in the intermediate layer taking place during vulcanization of the entire construction. US A 4 174 244 relates to a printer s blanket comprising a composite of a fibrous or pressure sensitive adhesive backing material, a layer of a foamable and cross linkable elastomeric material over the backing material, a second fibrous material over the layer of foamable material, and a top layer of a non foamable cross linkable elastomeric material over the second layer of fibrous material. The composite is molded under pressure at an elevated temperature to achieve vulcanization of both elastomeric layers. It is a feature of this invention to provide a method of making a printing blanket, and the printing blanket made by the method, which is free of bubbles in the surface layer and in the substrate or base layer, and is relatively inexpensive to produce. Pursuant to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a compressible printing blanket comprising a base layer, a surface layer, and a compressible intermediate layer, said intermediate layer having voids which are produced by heat activated blowing agent gas, and which are incorporated in an elastomeric material the improvement is characterized by a composite compressible intermediate layer having an elastomeric material which is sandwiched between two reinforcing fabric layers one of which is uncovered, the other one of which is covered with an adhesive, said elastomeric material being in a vulcanized state and having said voids incorporated therein prior to its disposition between said base layer and said surface layer. In the compressible printing blanket described, the improvement comprises the additional steps that the compressible intermediate layer is made by sandwiching elastomeric material between two layers of blanket fabric prior to heat activating the blowing agents. When the blowing agents are heat activated, the voids of the compressible layer are created prior to disposing the compressible intermediate layer between the base ply layer and the surface layer. By this means, the prior art problem of the gases created by the blowing agent migrating into the base ply layer and the surface layer is avoided. Pursuant to another aspect of this invention, there is provided a method of making a printing blanket, comprising the steps of forming a base layer, a surface layer, and an intermediate layer which includes a blowing agent incorporated in an elastomeric material, disposing said intermediate layer between said base layer and said surface layer, and subjecting said layers to heat and pressure the improvement is characterized by the steps of providing two reinforcing fabric layers one of which is uncovered, the other one of which is covered with an adhesive, sandwiching said intermediate layer which contains said blowing agent between said two reinforcing fabric layers to produce a sandwiched layer, and heating said sandwiched layer to cure the elastomeric material and to activate and release gases from said blowing agent to produce voids in said intermediate layer said improved steps prevent gases produced by the blowing agent from migrating to the base layer and the surface layer during a subsequent step of disposing said sandwiched layer therebetween. In the method described, the improvement comprises the steps of disposing the intermediate layer of elastomeric material between two fabric layers, and subjecting this sandwiched layer to a cure in order to activate and release gases from the blowing agent, thus producing voids in the intermediate layer prior to disposing the intermediate layer between the base layer and the surface layer. After the voids are created in the compressible intermediate layer by activating the blowing agent, an adhesive is spread on at least one side of the sandwiched layer before disposing it between the base layer and the surface layer. The assembled layers of the blanket are then subjected to heat and pressure. By this method, the blowing agent gases are released prior to the laminating step in the construction of the printing blanket, which obviates the possibility of gases produced by blowing agents from migrating to the base ply or the surface layer. At the same time, the intermediate layer is vulcanized. Accordingly, it is the object of this invention to provide a printing blanket having one or more of the novel features set forth above or hereinafter shown or described. The features of the invention, and its technical advantages, can be seen from the following description of preferred embodiments, together with the claims and the accompanying drawing, in which Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which illustrates a printing blanket made according to the present invention. The printing blanket comprises a surface layer 20, an upper reinforcing fabric layer 22, a compressible intermediate layer 24, a lower reinforcing fabric layer 26, and a base layer 28, which comprises one or more fabric plies. Voids 30 in the compressible intermediate layer 24 permit displacement of the surface layer 20 without distortion thereof. Adhesive layer 36 binds the compressible intermediate layer 24 to the reinforcing fabric layer 22. The printing blanket of the present invention has a surface layer 20 which is smooth, and which is substantially free of bubbles and voids such as sometimes appear in the prior art blankets when gases produced by the blowing agent migrate into the surface area. Furthermore, the base ply is free of such bubbles and voids such as are created in the prior art blankets when the gases produced by the blowing agent migrate or wick into the base layer. Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is a flow diagram illustrating the process steps used in making a compressible printing blanket according to the present invention. The same reference numbers are used throughout the drawing to represent the same elements of the invention. According to the present method, the elastomeric material of the intermediate layer is formulated by conventional means incorporating conventional blowing agents. The elastomeric compound which incorporates the blowing agent is spread by a conventional means into a layer 24 on a conventional reinforcing fabric layer 26. When the desired thickness of the layer 24 is achieved, generally in the order of 0.178 to 0.635 mm 0.007 to 0.025 inch , preferably 0.254 to 0.432 mm 0.010 to 0.017 inch , a second reinforcing fabric layer 22 is covered with adhesive 36 and is applied to the elastomeric layer 24. Thus, the layers 22, 24 and 26, and the adhesive 36, form a composite sandwiched layer, with the top and bottom of the elastomeric layer 24 being covered with reinforcing fabric. The material of the sandwiched layer is then subjected to heat, which activates the blowing agent and at the same time vulcanizes the layer 24. Thus, in this step, the blowing agent in the elastomeric material is activated, thereby emitting gases which create voids 30 in the elastomeric material. The vulcanization stabilizes the elastomeric material and fixes the voids 30 as to position and size. This cure step is carried out until all the gases from the blowing agents are released. After the elastomeric, compressible intermediate layer 24 is cured, an elastomeric adhesive 34, preferably rubber cement, is applied to at least one fabric ply 26. The adhesive will generally be applied to a thickness of 0.051 to 0.127 mm 0.002 to 0.005 inch on the sandwiched layer. The sandwiched layer is then bonded to the base layer 28. Thereafter, the surface layer 20 is applied in the conventional manner by applying thin coats of elastomeric material to the upper surface of the fabric layer 22 of the sandwiched layer until the desired thickness of the surface layer 20 has been achieved. The surface layer 20, the base layer 28, and the compressible intermediate layer 24 are then subjected to an additional vulcanizing or curing step, which cures the blanket assembly. Since the gases produced by the blowing agent have been released in the first cure step of the compressible intermediate layer 24, there is no migration of gases from the blowing agent into the surface layer 20 or into the base layer 28 during this additional vulcanizing or curing step. The term elastomer , as used herein, includes a composition of an elastomer with the usual processing, stabilizing, strengthening and curing additives. Elastomers that may be used in the present invention are any suitable polymeric material which is considered a curable or vulcanizable elastomeric material. Examples of such materials are natural rubber, fluoroelastomers, SBR sryrene butadiene rubber , EPDM ethylene propylene non conjugated diene ter polymer rubber , butyl rubber, neoprene, NBR butyldiene acrylonitrile rubber , polyurethanes, etc. An elastomer which is resistant to solvents and ink is preferred. Any of the blowing agents known in the art that are activated in the desired temperature range may be used to create the voids in the compressible intermediate layer. It is preferred that the blowking agent be activated at 93 C to 160 C 200 to 320 F . In general, blowing agents that generate nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide or water vapor, or mixtures thereof, can be used. Blowing agents that generate nitrogen or carbon dioxide gases are preferred. Examples of blowing agents that may be used are magnesium sulfate, hydrated salts, hydrazides such as p toluene sulfonyl hydrazide and p,p oxybisbenzene sulfonyl hydrazide, and carbonamides such as 1,1 azobisformamide. Nitrate, nitrite, bicarbonate and carbonate salts can also be used. The vulcanizing step in the method is carried out by conventional prior art methods. Ordinarily, the vulcanizing step can be carried out at temperatures up to 93 C to 160 C 200 F to 320 F . Preferably, this step will be carried out at 143 C to 149 C 290 F to 300 F , at pressures in the range of atmospheric 517 to 125 Pa 75 psi , for about 1 2 to 16 hours. The fabric layers 22, 26 and 28 are preferably made of fine plain woven fabric having lower extensibility in the warp direction in the longitudinal or machining direction of the blanket in service , and are typically made from high grade cotton yarn, and are free from slubs and knots, weaving defects, seeds, etc. The fabric used may be, for example, cotton, rayon, nylon, aramid, or polyester, and may be woven or non woven. Typically, the fabric layer will be 0.127 to 0.508 mm 0.005 0.020 inch thick. Aside from the preparation of the compressible intermediate layer as described above, the printing blanket of the invention may be prepared using methods known in the art. For production purposes, it is also possible to prepare a sandwiched compressible layer for use as an intermediate layer in a printing blanket in one location, and to ship to another location for fabrication of the blanket the compressible intermediate layer, by itself, thus represents a separate feature of the instant invention. While present exemplary embodiments of the novel product and method of this invention are illustrated and described herein, it is to be understood that the invention may be otherwise variously embodied and practical within the scope of the following claims.
