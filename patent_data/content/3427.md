# Preparation of m p bromophenoxy benzaldehyde.

## Abstract
A process for preparing m p bromophenoxy benzaldehyde of the formula This process, achieving a nucleic halogenation is a nucleus of an aldehyde which nucleus is not aldehyde substituted, is preferably carried out in a halogenation resistant solvent and may be carried out with heating. If a solvent is employed, however, the reaction temperature is preferably below the boiling point of the solvent. The presence of a catalyst is not essential to the performance of the process of the invention.
