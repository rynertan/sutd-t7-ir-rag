## Description
QUENCH OILS, CONCENTRATES FOR MAKING QUENCH OILS AND METHODS OF TREATING METALS Properties of steel can be varied by heat treatment to obtain desired microstructures such as martensitic microstructure. Quenching and tempering is the heat treatment commonly used to obtain such microstructures.It involves heating steel to an austenitizing temperature such as 800 C, and then cooling through the martensite transformation temperature range at a rate rapid enough to minimise transformation at temperatures above the martensite range. This is accomplished by quenching the heated steel. The first requisite of a quenching medium is therefore a sufficient cooling rate to obtain the desired results. The temperature gradient caused by the quenching operation results in relatively high thermal and transformation stresses which may if excessive lead to cracking or distortion. In the prevention of these problems, the maximum quenching rate is limited by the nature of the component being heat treated. Quenching media commonly used are water, oil and brine Brine quenching is the most severe. Water approaches it in severity. Oil quenching is much less drastic. It has been proposed to add to various mineral oils to be used as quench oils an ashless dispersant such as an alkenyl succinimide. See for instance United StatesPatent Specification No. 3866603. A need remains however for a quench oil having improved chemical stability and less tendancy to deposit material on work pieces quenched therein. According to the present invention quench oil is provided which comprises a major amount of a mineral oil and contains effective amounts of ashless dispersent, alkaline earth metal or alkali metal detergent, and ashless antioxidant. A preferred embodiment of the invention is a quench oil for use in the heat treatment of ferro metals, said composition comprising a major amount of mineral oil and a about 0.3 7.5 weight percent of ashless dispersant which is one or more of i a polyisobutenyl succinimide of an alkylenepolyamine, ii a polyisobutenyl succinic ester of an alcohol containing 1 20 carbon atoms and 1 6 hydroxy groups, iii a polyisobutenyl succinic esteramide of a mixture of x an amine containing 2 10 carbon atoms and 2 10 amine nitrogen atoms, and y an alcohol containing 1 20 carbon atoms and 1 6 hydroxy groups, and optionally 1 4 amine nitrogen atoms, or iv a Mannich condensate of a polyisobutylphenol, formaldehyde, and an amine containing 1 20 carbon atoms and 1 10 amine groups at least one of which is a primary amine group b 0.2 2.5 weight percent of alkaline earth or alkali metal detergent which is one or more of an alkaline earth metal arylsulfonate, alkali metal arylsulfonate, alkaline earth metal alkylphenate, alkaline earth metal sulfurized alkylphenate or an alkaline earth metal phosphonate phenate and c 0.01 20 weight percent of ashless antioxidant which is one or more of i a sterically hindered phenol, ii an alkylated aromatic amine, or iii a sulfurized alkylphenol. The base mineral oil is suitably a liquid hydrocarbon obtained by conventional petroleum refining methods including hydrocracking, hydrotreating and the like. A useful viscosity range is about 1.5 to 20cSt at 1000C and more preferably 4 to 12cut at 1000C The Ashless Dispersant The preferred ashless dispersant is an alkenyl succinimide of an amine having at least one primary amine group capable of forming an imide group. Representative examples are given in US 3,172,892 US 3,202,678 US 3,219,666 US 3,272,746 US 3,254,025 and US 3,216,936. The alkenyl succinimides may be formed by conventional methods such as by heating an alkenyl succinic anhydride, acid, acid ester or lower alkyl ester with an amine containing at least one primary amine group. The alkenyl succinic anhydride may be made readily by heating a mixture of olefin and maleic anhydride to about 1800 2200C. The olefin is preferably a polymer or copolymer of a lower monoolefin such as ethylene , propylene, isobutylene and the like. The more preferred source of alkenyl group is from polyisobutylene having a molecular weight up to 10,000 or higher. In a still more preferred embodiment the alkenyl is a polyisobutylene group having a molecular weight of about 700 5,000 and most preferably about 900 2,000. Amines which may be employed include any that have at least one primary amine group which can react to form an imide group. A few representative examples are methylamine 2 ethylhexylamine n dode cyl amine stearylamine N,N dimethyl propanediamine N 3 aminopropyl morpholine N dodecyl propanediamine N aminopropyl piperazine ethanolamine N ethanol ethylene diamine and the like. The preferred amines are the alkylene polyamines such as propylene diamine, dipropylene triamine, di 1,2 butylene triamine, tetra 1,2 propylene pentaamine. The most preferred amines are the ethylene polyamines which have the structureEMI5.1 wherein n is an integer from one to about ten. These include ethylene di amine diethylene triamine triethylene tetraamine tetraethylene pentaamine pentaethylene hexaamine and the like including mixtures thereof in which case n is the average value of the mixture. These ethylene polyamines have a primary amine group at each end so can form mono alkenylsuccinimides and bis alkenylsuccinimides. The most preferred for use in this invention are the bis alkenylsuccinimides. Another class of useful ashless dispersants includes alkenyl succinic acid esters and diesters of alcohols containing 1 20 carbon atdms and 1 6 hydroxyl groups.Representative examples are described in US 3,331,776 US 3,381,022 and US 3,522,179. The alkenyl succinic portion of these esters corresponds to the alkenyl succinic portion of the succinimides described above including the same preferred and most preferred sub genus e.g. polyisobutenyl succinic acids wherein the polyisobutenyl group has an average molecular weight of 9002,000. Alcohols useful in preparing the esters include methanol, ethanol, isobutanol, octadecanql, eicosanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monethylether, propylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, 1,1,1 trimethylol ethane, 1,1,1, trimethylol propane, l,l,l trimethylol butane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, and the like. The succinic esters are readily made by merely heating a mixture of alkenyl succinic acid, anhydrides or lower alkyl e.g.Cl C4 ester with the alcohol while distilling out water or lower alkanol. In the case of acid esters less alcohol is used. In fact, acid esters made from alkenyl succinic anhydrides do not evolve water. In another method the alkenyl succinic acid or anhydride can be merely reacted with an appropriate alkenyl oxide such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and the like, including mixtures thereof. In another embodiment the ashless dispersant is an alkenyl succinic ester amide mixture. These may be made by heating the above described alkenyl succinic acids, anhydrides or lower alkyl esters with an alcohol and an amine either sequentially or in a mixture. The alcohols and amines described above are also useful in this embodiment. Alternatively, amino alcohols can be used alone or with the alcohol and or amine to form the ester amide mixtures. The amino alcohol can contain 1 20 carbon atoms, 1 6 hydroxy groups and 1 4 amine nitrogen atoms. Examples are ethanolamine, diethanolamine,N ethanol diethylene triamine, trimethylol aminomethane. Representative examples of suitable ester amide mixtures are described in US 3,184,474 US 3,576,743 US 3,632,511 US 3,804,763 US 3,836,471 US 3,862,981 US 3,936,480 US 3,948,800 US 3,950,341 US 3957,854 US 3,957,855 US 3,991,098 US 4,071,548 and US 4,l73,540. Another useful class of ashless dispersants includes the Mannich condensates of hydrocarbyl substituted phenols, formaldehyde or formaldehyde precursors e.g.paraformaldehyde and an amine having at least one primary amine group and containing 1 10 amine groups and 1 20 carbon atoms. Mannich condensates useful in this invention are described in US 3,442,808 US 3,448,047 US 3,539,633 US 3,591,598 US 3,600,372 US 3,634,515 US 3,697,574 US 3,703,536 US 3,704,308 US 3,725,480 US 3,726,882 US 3,736,357 US 3,751,365 US 3,756,953 US 3,793,202 US 3,798,165 US 3,798,247 US 3,803,039, and US 3,413,347. More preferred Mannich condensates are those made by condensing a polyisobutylphenol wherein the polyisobutyl group has an average molecular weight of about 800 3,000 with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde precursor and an ethylene polyamine having the formulaEMI8.1 wherein n is an integer from one to ten or mixtures thereof especially those in which n has an average value of 3 5. The amount of ashless dispersant in the quench oil can vary over a wide range. A useful concentration range is about 0.3 7.5 weight percent. A more preferred concentration is about 0.7 4 weight percent. The Alkaline Earth or Alkali Metal Detergent The more preferred alkaline earth or alkali metal detergents are the alkaline earth or alkali metal arylsulfonates. These include both the so called natural sulfonates derived by sulfuric extraction of petroleum as well as the synthetic sulfonates made by sulfonating synthetic alkylbenzenes. The alkaline earth metal sulfonates include both neutral and over based sulfonates.The term alkaline earth metal as used herein includes calcium, barium and magnesium. The term alkali metal as used herein includes sodium. The most preferred alkaline earth metal arylsulfonates are the calcium salts of alkylbenzene sulfonic acids in which the alkylbenzenes have an average molecular weight of about 300 700. Another useful class of alkaline earth metal detergents includes the alkaline earth metal alkyl phenates e.g.US 2,228,671 US 2,252,663 US 2,280,419 US 2,412,903 US 2,610,982 US 3,779,920 US 3,691,076 and alkaline earth metal sulfurized alkyl phenates. te.g. US 2,249,626 US 2,331,448 US 2,336,074 US 2,342,887 US 2,346,826 US 2,362,292 US 2,366,874 US 2,406,564 . These are made by reacting alkaline earth metal hydroxide or oxide e.g. CaO, Ca OH 2, BaO, Ba OH 2, MgO, Mg OH 2 with an alkylphenol or sulfurized alkylphenol. The alkyl substituent preferably contains about 4 20 carbon atoms such as in isobutylphenol, 2 ethylhexylphenol, nonylphenol, l ethyldecylphenol and the like. The corresponding sulfurized detergent is made by wellknown methods such as by heating a mixture of alkylphenol and sulfur and then reacting the sulfurized phenols with an alkaline earth metal base. Alkaline earth metal phosphonate phenates are typically made by the coneutralisation of a mixture of a phosphosulphurized polyolefin and an alkyl phenol or an alkyl phenol sulfide. Coneutralisation may be carried using, for example barium oxide, barium hydroxide, calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide or an alkoxide of magnesium or a carbonated alkoxide of magnesium in an alkanol, such as described in British Patent 1303048. The alkylphenol sulphide that is to say a compound containing two or more alkylphenol residues linked by one or more sulphur atoms or the alkylphenol is preferably one which has an aromatic nucleus that is substituted by an alkyl group having from 5 to 20 carbon atoms, especially from 7 to 12 carbon atoms. An alkyl group having 9 carbon atoms is often particularly satisfactory. It is often preferable to use an alkylphenol sulphide rather than the alkylphenol itself. The sulphide can be a monosulphide, but disuiphides, trisulphides, tetrasulphides, pentasulphides and other polysulphides are also very useful. A suitable alkylphenol sulphide can in fact be made from an appropriate alkylphenol by reaction with sulphur dichloride, the composition of the product depending on the molar ratio of alkylphenol to sulphur dichloride used and the alkylphenol residues being linked in general by monosulphide links. Examples of suitable Rkylphenol sulphide and alkylphenol starting materials are nonylphenol and dodecylphenol and the product of reacting from three to five moles of an alkylphenol in which the alkyl group has from 7 to 11 carbon atoms with from two to four moles of sulphur dichloride. A particularly preferred example being the reaction product of four moles of nonylphenol and three moles of sulphur dichloride. The polyolefin that is used in phosphosulphurised form is preferably one of relatively low molecular weight it can be for example a polypropylene, polybutene or polyisobutylene, for instance one that has an average molecular weight between 500 and 2500, for example 1100. It can for instance have been phosphosulphurised by reacting it with a phosphorus sulphide such as for example P4S3,P4S7, or more preferably P2S5. The phosphosulphurised polyolefin can be used as such that is to say in the form in which it is produced by phosphosulphurisation. The alkylphenol sulphide or alkylphenol and the phosphosulphurised polyolefin can be used in any desired relative proportion, but usually it is preferred to employ these in a weight ratio between 1 12 and 6 1 especially between 1 9 and 4 1 and more preferably between 3 7 and 1 1. The amount of alkaline earth metal detergent can vary from about 0.02 to about 2.5 weight percent. A preferred range is about 0.05 to 2.0 weight percent and a most preferred range is about 0.1 to 1.0 weight percent. The Ashless Antioxidant A very useful class of ashless antioxidants includes the hindered phenols. These are phenolic compounds having at least one tert alkyl group substituted at a nuclear position ortho to a phenolic hydroxyl group. Representative examples of these are 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol 2,6 di tert butyl 4 ethylphenol 2,6 di tert butylphenol 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butylphenol 4,4 bis 2,6 di tert butylphenol 2,6 di tert butyl alpha dimethylamino p cresol 2,2 methylenebis 4 methyl 6 tert butylphenol 2,2 ethylidenebis 4,6 di tert butylphenol 1,3,5 tri 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl 2,4,6 trimethylbenzene octadecyl 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate tetra E 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionatJ pentaerythritol 0,0 di octadecyl 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl phosphonate and the like. Another useful class of ashless antioxidants are the aromatic amines. Examples of these are N ,N di octyl phenylenediamine, N isopropylphenylenediamine and the like. The most preferred of these are the alkylated diphenylamines such as di octylphenyl amine di dodecylphenyl amine octylphenyl dodecylphenylamine and the like. Of the sub class the most preferred is di nonylphenyl amine. Sulfurized alkylphenols can also be used as the ashless antioxidant. These can be made by reacting an alkylphenol with elemental sulfur at elevated temperature.This forms sulfur bridging groups between alkylphenol molecules. The phenols are preferably para alkylated.Examples of alkylphenols which make useful sulfurized products are p dodecylphenol p octadecylphenol p eicosylphenol p isobutylphenol and the like. The most preferred is sulfurized p nonylphenol. The amount of ashless antioxidant in the quench oil should be an amount that provides the required amount of stablization. A useful range is about 0.01 to 2 weight percent and more preferably about 0.05 to 1.0 weight percent. In commerce a convenient way to prepare the quench oil is to add a quench oil concentrate to the mineral oil base. The concentrate contains the proper amount of each additive such that when blended in the mineral oil base the resultant quench oil will contain the proper amount of each additive. In the concentrate a useful concentration range of each class of additive is 25 to 60 weight percent ashless dispersant, 2 to 15 weight percent alkaline earth metal detergent, and 1 to 20 weight percent ashless antioxidant. The invention will be illustrated by the following examples. Examples Initially tests were conducted to compare the cooling rate of the present quench oil according to the invention with the cooling rate of the base oil. The method used was the Wolfson Heat Treatment Centre Test Method. In this test a specified stainless steel probe of length 60mm and diameter 12.5mm and containing a thermocouple is soaked at 8500C in a furnace and then rapidly transferred to a 2 litre sample of the quench oil held at 400C. The temperature vs time and the rate of temperature change vs temperature as measured by the thermocouple are recorded. The test method is described in detail in LaboratoryTest for Assessing the Cooling Characteristics ofIndustrial Quenching Media ISBN 0 9507768 2 3 available from the Wolfson Heat Treatment Centre, The University of Aston in Birmingham, Gosta Green, Birmingham B4 7ETEngland.
