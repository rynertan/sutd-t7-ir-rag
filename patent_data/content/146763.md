## Description
Handling system for workpieces to be operated in a machineThis invention concerns a handling system for workpieces to be operated in a machine. In our case handling system means an equipment or a part of one designed to pick up a piece from a quantity of such pieces which, one by one, must be machined in a machine, to carry each of said pieces to a position in front of the machine, to introduce it, withdraw it and remove it from the machine and finally to carry it to a station from which it is discharged. The term workpiece will be used for a piece to be operated in a machine and the term operated piece will be used for the same piece after it has been operated in the above machine.The handling systems already known generally comprise a part for linear actuation, namely a linear actuator, that handles one piece at a time to carry out the movements listed above.The chief drawback to handling systems in use is the slowness with which they operate, due to the dead times in the phases of idling movement of the linear actuator.The handling system conforming to this present invention comprises a linear actuator having two seats for moving two pieces simultaneously, fixed supporting means for the pieces when they are disengaged from the linear actuator, a means designed to introduce a workpiece in a machine executing an operational sequence and withdraw the operated piece from said machine, said linear actuator being associated to movers which cause it to make lateral and transversal movements alternately in two directions perpendicular in relation to the said supporting means and to the machine, so that the linear actuator picks up from its own first seat a first workpiece placed on a first supporting means, carries the first workpiece in front of a machining station, disengages the first workpiece from its own first seat and places it on a second supporting means from which the first workpiece is introduced into and withdrawn from the machine, while a second workpiece arrives at the first supporting means, returns to an initial position in which its first seat lies directly below the second workpiece placed on the first supporting means and its second seat lies directly below the operated piece placed on the second supporting means, places the second workpiece on its own first seat and the operated piece on its own second seat, carries the second workpiece in front of the machining station, disengages the first operated piece from its own second seat and pla ces it on a third supporting means from which it is discharged and disengages the second workpiece from its own first seat and places it on the second supporting means from which the second workpiece is introduced into and withdrawn from the ma chine, while a third workpiece reaches the first supporting means, returns to the initial position in which its own first seat lies directly below the third workpiece placed on the first supporting means and its own second seat lies directly below the second operated piece placed on the second supporting means, repeats the sequence described above until the hand ling system is stopped by an operator or by a conventional de vice that stops the handling system when the last piece from a quantity of pieces has been operated and discharged from the handling system.The advantage of the handling system conforming to this present invention is that dead times throughout the service sequence are minimal some phases of the service sequence of the invented handling system are in fact executed simultaneously. are way of actuating the invention is described below in detail making reference to the attached drawings showing a specific realization only wherein Fig. 1 is a diagram of a number of operative phases,Fig. 2 is a vertical cross sectional view along the line X X in Fig. 1, phase 1,Fig. 3 is a diagram of the handling system associated to a ma chine,Fig. 4 is a partly cut through side view of the handling sys tem seen as indicated by the arrow F in Fig. 2,Fig. 5 is a plan view of the handling system.The handling system illustrated is associated to a machine for seaming a circular base onto a cylindrical container of white latten for foodstuffs. In this example, therefore, the workpiece is a cylindrical body the circular container base is suitably positioned as required in the machine by an ordinary means extraneous to this invention.Fig. 1 shows means 1 of a linear actuator T, while means 2 of the same linear actuator T, identical and parallel to means 1 situated behind the latter and so invisible in Fig. 1, is suf ficiently spaced away from means 1 so that a workpiece can be received and held on the two saddles 3 or on the two saddles 4 formed in means 1 and 2 a linear actuator T associated to movers not shown for sequentially executing movements in the planes containing means 1 and 2 and, namely, referring for con venience to the central point A of saddle 3 and to the drawings start of sequence and phase 1 a vertical movement takingA from 0 to I, a horizontal movement taking A from I to II, a vertical movement taking A from II to III, a horizontal move ment taking A from III to 0 three pairs of supporting means 5,5 6,6 7,72, able to receive and to sustain a piece, fixed in the handling system and so positioned as not to interfere with the movements of linear actuator T, means 5,5 lying directly above the saddle 3, when linear actuator T has point A in position I, means 6,6 lying directly above the saddle 4. when the linear actuator T has point A in position I and means 7,7 lying directly above saddle 4 when the linear actuator T has point A in position II.The arrow marked against the linear actuator T in each drawing in Fig.1 indicates the direction of the next linear move ment. Value z is conventionally assigned to vertical movements and value x to horizontal movements, as shown in Fig.1, phase 1.Path z is that taken by means 1, 2 of the linear actuator T, in its upstroke, to raise saddles 3, 4 from a position below the supporting means 5,5 6,6 7,7 to a position above said supporting means and, in its downstroke, to lower saddles 3, 4 from the higher position to a lower position below said supporting means. Path x is equivalent to the distance between axes B B and L T and to the distance between axes L L and C C.Although a study of the drawings in Fig.1 and in Fig.3 renders the mode of operating of the linear actuator and of the handling system comprehensible as a whole, below we are giving a brief description of each of the nine drawings in Fig. 1. start of sequence T is on the right low down and a first workpiece 0 arrives at 5,5 , w phase 1 T is raised and picks up 0 onto saddle 3, phase 2 T is moved to the left, phase 3 T is lowered, 0 is placed on 6,6 and is pushed into the machine, operated and returned to 6,6 a second workpiece 0 is brought to 5,5 , phase 4 T is moved to the right, phase 5 T is raised and picks up 0 and 0 phase 6 T is moved to the left and takes 0 over 7,7 and 0 over 6,6 , phase 7 T is lowered, 0 is placed on 7,7 and is then discharged, 0 is placed on 6,6 and introduced into the machine, operated and returned to 6,6 a third workpiece 0 is brought to 5,5 phase 8 T is moved to the right, the handling system is once more in the osjnn an for phase 4 and continues through the subsequent Fig.2 shows a workpiece 0 placed on the supporting means 5w5 and a Joining bar 27 between means 1 and 2.Fig.3 shows a station ST 1 at which a workpiece arrives by force of gravity, as indicated by the arrow Fl, and rests on the supporting means 5,5 not shown at the start of the se quence see Fig.1 a station ST 2 to which the workpiece is brought by linear actuator T not shown and introduced in to the machining station ST L by a means R, as indicated by the arrow F2 and then withdrawn from said machining station by means R, as indicated by arrow F3, after being operated by the machine M a station ST 3 to which the operated piece is taken by linear actuator v and discharged from the handling system by gravity as indicated by arrow F4. Lines B B, L L, C C of Fig. 3 correspond to lines , L L, C C of Fig. 1. Each of these lines corresponds to the longitudinal axis of one of the above stations. The means R comprises a conventional thrust device that presses a workpiece to introduce it into machining station ST L tnd position it suitably in the machine M, and comprises a conventional gripping device which takes hold of an operated piece withdrawing it from the machining station and placing it on the supporting means 6,6 .Figs 4 and 5 essentially show the linear actuator T associated to other parts of the handling system a fixed plate 20, suitably placed, in relation to a machine not shown, on stands 21 only one of these is visible in Fig. 4 on which plate are mounted the three pairs of supporting means 5,5 6,6 7,7 and a first mobile plate 22 mounted at the summit of four columps23 two only of which are visible in Fig. 4 passing through the fixed plate 20 and fixed below to a second mobile plate 24 four supports 25 for two bars 26 extending between two sides 27 connecting the two plates 1, 2 plate 1 is omitted in Fig. 4 otherwise it would impede a view of the parts comprised between plates 1, 2 a first pneumatic cylinder 28 is fixed onto the first mobile plate 22, it has one end of rod 29 articulated on the left side 27 and is connected to a source of compressed air not shown conventionally controlled and driven so as to cause the frame composed of parts 27, 1, 2 with its bars 26, to slide within the holes of supports 25 and bring saddles 3, 4 to the positions already indicated in the description relating to Fig. 1 a second pneumatic cylin der 30 is fixed below the fixed plate 20, it has one end of rod 31 articulated onto the second mobile plate 24 and is con nected to a source of compressed air not shown conventional ly controlled and driven so as to cause the mobile plate 22 to move upwards or downwards bringing saddles 3, 4 of plates 1, 2 to the positions in relation to the supporting means 5,5 6, 6 7, 7 already described in connection with Fig. 1.Fig. 4 shows that the first mobile plate 22 can be raised by a distance z.In the following claims we will conventionally use the words lateral and transfersal to describe the movements made by the parts in directions x and z respectively.
