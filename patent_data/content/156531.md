# Apparatus for forming annular grooves or slits in rod shaped articles.

## Abstract
An apparatus as disclosed for forming annular grooves or slits in rod shaped articles such as cigarette filter plugs. The apparatus comprises an endless belt 32 or similar device and, spaced therefrom, a second element 66 defin ing with the belt a channel of predetermined width. Prefer ably, the channel size can be adjusted by moving the belt, the second element or both toward or away from each other. The belt is driven to enable it, in cooperation with the second element, to transport a rod shaped article F along the channel. A forming device, preterably a rotating disk knife 62 , has a portion disposed in the channel and cuts any article moved therealong. The second element is preferably contoured to be spaced a constant distance from the profile of the belt, to ensure that the groove formed in the article is concentric with the longitudinal axis of the latter.
