# A method of determining the length of a string of well production tubing.

## Abstract
In a method of determining the length change of a string of tubing 12 in a vertical or deviated well caused by fluid flow through the tubing during production or stimulation of the well, the pressure of the fluid is measured where the fluid enters the tubing and, for successive sections of the tubing, the actual force applied to the tubing is determined from the fluid pressure acting upon the cross sectional area of the tubing. The inclination and weight of each section of the tubing is measured and from the measured inclination the weight of each section is resolved into the axial component applied to the next successive segment. For each of the suc cessive sections, the buckling force is determined from the actual force and the axial component of the weight and then the buckling force is compared to a threshold to determine if there is buckling of the tubing. The length change of the tubing 12 between the initial condition and the condition of fluid flow in the tubing caused by the pressure and tempera ture of the fluid and caused by any buckling is then deter mined and an output is produced indicating the change in length of the tubing.
