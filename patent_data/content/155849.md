## Description
Substrate for planographic plate BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a substrate for planographic lithographic plate having excellent printing aptitude and printing resistance.In general, metals such as aluminum or stainless steel sheets have been employed as a substrate for planographic plate.However, a substrate for planographic plate of a metallic single substance is heavy with poor workability and also expensive.Accordingly, a printing plate structure with an aluminum sheet foil laminated on one surface of a thermoplastic resin sheet has been proposed Japanese Patent Publication No. 41362 1976 .However, the substrate by use of one surface metal foil laminated sheet is liable to be curled, and the printing plate by use of this sheet is also poor in printing resistance and printing aptitude, thus failing to be suitable for a printing substrate. Accordingly, for suppression of generation of curl in the one surface metal foil laminated sheet, a substrate for planographic plate by use of a sheet prepared from a mixture of a polyolefin resin and an inorganic filler as a thermoplastic resin sheet was proposed.However, such a substrate for planographic plate proved to involve the problem that the printing plate by use of this sheet is poor in printing resistance, particularly in printing resistance in multiple printing e.g. multicolor printing in which some tens of thousands sheets are to be printed, and therefore limited in uses SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present inventors have studied intensively to provide a substrate for planographic plate by combination of a thermoplastic resin sheet and a metal foil, having no problem as mentioned above, and consequently accomplished the present invention.More specifically, the present invention concerns a substrate for planographic plate, which comprises metal foils with thicknesses of 5 to 100 laminated on both surfaces of a sheet with a thickness of 30 to 400 , said sheet being obtained by sheet making of a modified polyolefin composite material comprising 100 parts by weight of a modified polyolefin resin graft modified partially or wholly with an organic silane compound and 5 to 150 parts by weight of mica.

The modified polypropylene obtained immediately after the modification MFR 100 g 10 min. was subjected to water crosslinking in the air at 80 OC for about 3 days. 14 Parts of the pellets 2 mmf x 3 mm of the resultant modified polypropylene MFR 50 g 10 min. , 56 parts of pellets 2 mmf x 3 mm of a crystalline polypropylene homopolymer MFR 0.5 g 10 min. further 0.1 phr of BHT, 0.1 phr of Irganox 1010 trade name, produced by Ciba Geigy of Japan and 0.2 phr of calcium stearate were added and 30 parts of mica Suzorite mica 325HK, mean particle size 20 y, mean aspect ratio 20 25, containing 1 wt. or more of flakes of 100 g or more, produced by Kuraray K.K. 1 were mixed homogeneously by means of a continuous biaxial kneading machine, FCM produced by Kobe Seikosho K.K. at 200 OC to obtain a composite material.This material was formed into a sheet, according to theT die method, by use of a sheet molding machine, NRM produced by Mitsubishi Jyukogyo K.K. at a molding temperature of 200 OC to obtain a sheet with a thickness of 240 ij and a width of I m. The mechanical properties of the thus obtained sheet are tensile strength 3.96 kg mm2 MD , 3.82 kg mm2 TD elongation 10 MD , 4 TD tensile modulus of elasticity 310 kg mm2 MD 291 kg mm2 TD On both surfaces of this sheet, aluminum foils with a thickness of 30 p elongation 2.0 , rigid 1N30H were laminated with the use of an urethane type adhesive 5 g m2 on front surface, 10 g m2 on back surface according to the roll method to obtain a sheet laminated on both surfaces with aluminum foils with a thickness of about 300 ij and a weight of about 0.4 kg m2.

Developer Sakura SDP 1 produced by Ronishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd. 2. Printing machine test method i Printing machine 480 K off set printing machine produced by Ryobi K.K. Ink four colors of process red, yellow, blue and black. ii Printing speed 10000 rpm.Printing resistance was evaluated from the changes in dot area and dot density at the shadow portion and the highlight portion of the printed product and further from the reflected density change at the gray scale portion.From the beginning of printing to printing of 50000 sheets, no such phenomenon as slendering of dots or lowering in ink attachment at image lines was recognized at all, and good printing aptitude was retained.During printing badness percentage due to breaking at the nip portion on mounting of the printing plate on printing rolls was found to be 0 tested for each of 5 sheets .Example 2A composite material was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the formulated ratios of the respective components were changed as 14 parts for the modified polypropylene MFR 50 g 10 min. , 36 parts for the crystalline polypropylene homopolymer MFR 0.5 g 10 min. and 50 parts for the mica 325 HK .By use of this composite material, a laminated sheet substrate for planographic plate and then a planographic plate were prepared similarly as in Example 1.
