# Multi step parallel analog digital converter.

## Abstract
A multi step A D converter of the successive approxima tion type utilizes a single three position switchable current output DAC in combination with a voltage divider, a plurality of comparators, a decoder, a successive approximation register and a control logic module to provide a high speed, high resolution A D converter requiring fewer parts than the prior art A D converters of this general type.
