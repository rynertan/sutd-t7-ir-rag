# Leak detection for basic sediment and water apparatus.

## Abstract
A process is provided for measuring the water and sediment content of a wet stream which is predominantly non aqueous. The process requires removing a sample of the wet stream, extracting a dry stream sample from the wet stream sample, and comparing the dielectric constants of the wet and dry streams. Leakage of any of the wet stream sample into the dry stream sample will adversely affect the comparison of dielectric con stants. Accordingly, periodically the apparatus used for the process is checked for leakage by blocking conduits carrying the dry stream sample to a holding chamber.
