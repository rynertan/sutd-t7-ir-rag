# Electromagnetic apparatus and method of lifting and or turning a slab of steel or other ferromagnetic material.

## Abstract
When an electromagnet 2 is employed to lift and turn a slab of steel, there is a risk that the slab is dropped, causing undesirable noise. Also, with a flat contact surface of the electromagnet, there is jerking of the apparatus. Improve ment in both respects is achieved by the use of a singly curved convex contact surface 7 of the electromagnet, which pro vides line contact with the slab at all times, avoiding transi tions from line contact to face contact.
