## Description
D2ROR5D AQUEOUS DISPERSION MlCROBIOCIDE COMPOSITION CONEGULNqNG METHYLENE BIS THIOC WXATE The present invention is concerned with aqueous dispersion microbiocide compositions containing methylene bis thiocyanate , also called fBT. Methylene bis thioc anate has been for some time and continues to be a widely used antimicrobial agent. It has a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria and fungi and has been found to be extremely effective at low cost levels.As a consequence, it is especially useful as an agent for controlling slime producing organisms in pulp and paper mill systems and in cooling water systems. Hitherto, the antimicrobial agent methylene bis thiocyanate has been made up and applied essentially in the form of an organic solvent solution. Problems of toxicity and environmental contamination and other problems resulting from the use of such organic solvents has led to a search for a satisfactory aqueous dispersion of methylene bis thio ctanate . Such an aqueous dispersion must be stable, that is, the methylene bis thiocyanate must not settle out of the dispersion. Also, it is preferable to have an aqueous dispersion which can be handled by pumping equipment which is frequently employed without degradation of the aqueous dispersion. Such an aqueous dispersion of methylene bis thioc7anate is described in U.S. Patent No 3,996,378, which discloses a water based formulation of methylene bis thiocyanate in a xanthan gel. However, this dispersion has been found to lack sustained stability, and on standing has been found difficult to pump without preliminary agitation. Parran U.S. Patent No 3,761,417 describes detergent compositions containing particle deposition enhancing agents in which antimicrobial agents and certain cationic polymers are combined with a surfactant. However, methylene bis thiocyanate is not described as a suitable antimicrobial agent for use in the detergent composition, and the improved aqueous dispersion composition containing methylene bis thiocanate of the present invention is not described or suggested in this patent. The present invention provides a microbiocide composition comprising methylene bis thiocyanate dispersed in an aqueous composition containing from 0.75 to 3.00 c by weight of a copolyampholyte, in the form of a seli inverting emulsion, comprising polymer units resulting from dimethyldiallylammonium XO, diethyldiallylammonium 9, acrylamide and optionally acrylate and from 5.0 to 15.0 by weight of a suspensionimproving and, viscosity improving inorganic substance in the form of colloidally fine particles. Also in accordance with the present invention water contaminated with microbes, that is, bacteria, fungi and or algae, is treated by incorporating in it at least a microbiocidal amount of a microbiocidal aqueous dispersion composition of the present invention. This method is especially applicable to inhibiting the growth of slime forming bacteria and fungi usually encountered in pulp and paper mill systems by bringing such bacteria or fungi into contact with at least a microbiocidal amount of the composition of the present invention, particularly by incorporating the microbiocidal composition into the mass of fiber and water in such a pulp and paper mill system. The present innention in contra distinction in particular to US Patent No 3,996,378, achieves an aqueous dispersion of methylene bis thiocyanate through the use of a particular copolampholyte in the form of a self inverting emulsion, and a suspension improving and viscositr improving inorganic substance in the form of colloidally fine particles. These ingredients have been found to provide a stable aqueous dispersion, that is, one from which the methylene bis thiocyanate does not settle.This stable aqueous dispersion composition is also readily pumpable. A number of other pol meric compositions have been evaluated, for example, carboxtmethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and polwinyl alcohol, but none of these has a given stable aqueous dispersion of methylene bis thiocaanate . The stable aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition containing methylene bis thiocanate achieved with the present invention thus offers particular advantages in the areas of preferred use. The use of an aqueous dispersion overcomes the disadvantages inherent in the use of organic solvents to dispense the methylene bis thiocyanate , that is, these organic solvents are both toxic and flammable. The stability of the aqueous dispersion of the present invention ensures that the methylene bis thioctanate will be dispensed efficiently, that is, in effective but economic amounts, and that there will be no settlin out of particles which can create blockages in the dispensing apparatus.The aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention also offers the important advantage of being readily pumpable, that is, it can be transported and dispensed by commonly employed pumping means without experiencing problems such as excessive viscosity, either during pumping or initially after standing, which would require that the dispersion be agitated before pumping could take place. Since the present invention concerns an aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition containing methylene bis thiocyanate , a water insoluble material, it will be appreciated that the particle size distribution of the methylene bis thiocyanate is of some importance. Generally, at least 33.0 of the particles should be less than 75 micrometers um in size, with no more than 0.1 of the total particles greater than 150 urn in size. In a preferred embodiment, the methylene bis thiocyanate is reduced in a homogenizer and the wet particles are screened so that a maximum of 0.1 is collected on a 100 mesh screen U.S. StandardTesting Sieves , while a minimum of 99.0 passes through a 200 mesh screen. This corresponds to a particle size of greater than 150 um for the 100 mesh screen, and less than 75 um for the 200 mesh screen.In another preferred embodiment, the methylene bis thiocyanate is reduced in a colloid mill. The particle size distribution for three batches processed through such a colloid mill, were found to be as follows Sieve Size On 100 mesh On 200 mesh Through 200 mesh um Size 150 75 4 75Specification max. 0.1 min. 99.0 Batch No. 1 0.01 1.10 98.83 2 0.01 0.75 99.24 3 trace 0.16 93.84 Various means can be employed to achieve the desired particle size range. For example, various colloid mills and homogenizers which are commonly available may be employed. Satisfactory results have been achieved using a Tekmar Super Dispax, SD 45N homogenizer at high speed for three minutes, as well as a Speco Colloid Mill. In the improved aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention the particles of methylene bis thiocyanate are dispersed in an aqueous composition containing two components, the first of which is a copolyampholyte in the form of a self inverting emulsion. The methylene bis thiocyanate is incorporated in an amount of from 5.0 to 25.0 by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous dispersion. The upper limit of the amount of methylene bis thiocyanate which may be incorporated is determined essentially only by the amount which it is physically possible to incorporate into the aqueous dispersion composition consistent with maintaining stability of the dispersion.The lower limit of the amount of methylene bis thiocyanate which may be incorporated is determined by the economic practicalities involved in marketing a composition of vary low active ingredient concentration. A preferred concentration of methylene bistthiocyanate in the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention is 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. The copolyampholyte self inverting emulsion is incorporated in an amount of from 0.75 to 3.0 by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous dispersion. It has been found that amounts below 0.75 do not give a stable dispersion, while amounts above 3.0 result in a dispersion which is too viscous. The copolyampholyte employed in the improved aqueous dispersion of the present invention may be represented by the following general formula EMI6.1 whe re DN1DAAX is a polymer unit resulting from monomeric dimethyldlallylammonium xo. is is a polymer unit resulting from monomeric diethyldiallylammonium X , X is an anion is hydrogen ammonium sodium or potassium 0 k and 1 are numbers such that the amount of DDAAXS is from 45 to 48 weight y and the amount of DEDAAX is from 2 to 5 weight jod, the said amounts together totalling 50 weight and in and n are numbers such that the amount of CH2 CH CO NH2 is from 45 to 50 weight and the amount of CH2 CH COOM is from O to 5 weight , the said amounts totalling 50 , the copolyampholyte having a molecular weight greater than 1 x 106. Any anion counterion compatible with microbiocidal use may be employed, and chloride is preferred. Other suitable anions include acetate, citrate, formate, glycolate, lactate, nitrate, oxalate, propionate, sulfate, and other halides, for example. Preferred pols mer compositions of Formula I are those in which X is chloro, the amount of DXIDAAX is 47.5 weight tod, the amount of DEDAAX is 2.5 weight and the amount of CH2 CHCONH2 is 47.64 weight and the amount of CH CR COOM is 2.36 weight , giving a copolyampholyte having repeating units of dimethyldiallylammonium chloride DMDAAC , diethyldiallylammonium chloride DED4AC , acrylamide AM , and acrylic acid AA , or the amount of CH2 CHCONH2 is 50 weight , giving a copolyampholyte having repeating units of dimethyldiallylammonium chloride DXIDAAC . diethyldiallylammonium chloride DEDAAC , and acrylamide AM .

Nos. 4,077,930 and 4,147,681. The second component used to disperse the methylene bis thiocyanate in order to form the improved aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention is a suspension and viscosity improving inorganic substance in the form of colloidally fine particles. Suitable materials are clays, such as colloidal attapulgite clay and kaolin clay, and silica. A preferred inorganic substance is colloidal attapulgite clay, for example, X 1925 clay from Engelhard Industries. The suspension and viscosity improving inorganic substance is incorporated in an amount of 5.0 to 15.0 by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous dispersion. in addition to the methylenebis thiocyanate active ingredient, self inverting emulsion of copolyampholyte and inorganic substance in the form of colloidally fine particles, the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention also contains a number of additional ingredients or excipients which are useful in producing a final aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition having the desired properties of viscosity, freeze thaw stability, pH, lack of foaming, and ease of addition to water systems.These additional ingredients or excipients are 1 0.1 to 1.0 by weight of a wetting agent. A preferred material is Triton x lOO available from Rohm Haas. The wetting agent is a processing aid employed to facilitate initial dispersion of the methylene bis thiocyanate particles in water, which is the first step of preparing the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention. 2 0.1 to 1.0 by weight of a defoaming agent. A preferred material is Colloid 691 from Colloids, Inc. The defoaming agent prevents excessive foaming of the wetting agent during processing, and also when the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition is added to an agitated water system, for example, that in a pulp and paper mill system. 3 2.0 to 5.0 by weight of a freeze thaw stabilizing agent, such as propylene glycol and 4 sufficient acid to give a final pH in the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of from 2.0 to 3.0. Any acid compatible with the overall aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition and with the end treatment environment may be used. Organic acids are preferred, especially acetic acid and formic acid. The acid functions to lend stability to the methylene bis thiacycnate , which may tend to hydrolyze at alkaline puts. The carrier for the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention is, of course, water, and this is present in an amount of from 50.0 to 87.00,b, preferably 70.0 to 80.0 by weight. The improved aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention will inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi in concentrations of 9 to 90 ppm. it is particularly useful at these concentrations for inhibiting the growth of slime forming bacteria and fungi usually encountered in pulp and paper mill systems and cooling water systems. For example, the aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition can be added to the paper mill white water or stock system at 1.09 to 10.9 fl oz. per 100 gal. 8.5 to 85 ppm by volume of treated water.Under conditions of extensive recirculation oi white water, high levels of fillers in the furnish, and or generally severe levels of potential slime forminy bacteria and fungi, dosages approaching 10.9 fl. oz. 1000 gal. 85 ppm v v of treated water may be necessary. Under less severe conditions, lower dosages approaching 1.09 fl. oz. 1000 gal. 8.5 ppm v v of treated water can be used. inhere the improved aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition of the present invention is employed to inhibit the growth of slime forming bacteria and fungi usually encountered in pulp and paper mill systems, it is metered directly, by means of proportioning pumps, to a location which will ensure its uniform distribution in the mass of fiber and water, for example to the beaters, Jordan inlet, broke chests, furnish chests, save allsr or white water tanks. detering of the improved aqueous dispersion microbiocide composition may be on a continuous or intermittent basis, provided that the recommended dosing is attained. Where metering is intermittent, the use of automatic timers is recommended.
