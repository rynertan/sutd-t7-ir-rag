# Gaseous insulating bushing.

## Abstract
A gaseous insulating bushing holds a center conductor 1 and includes a porcelain tube 2 enclosing therein an insulating gas. A cylindrical insulating partition 4 is arranged adjacent the inner wall 2 of the porcelain tube to divide the space therein into two spaces A,B which communicate with each other through small diameter vents 5 so as to eliminate pressure differences between the spaces, thereby reducing the back pressure upon explosion to suppress scattering of fragments of the porcelain tube.
