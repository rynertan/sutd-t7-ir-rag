# Method for separating a gas from a gaseous mixture and electrochemical cell therefor.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell used to separate gas from a gaseous mixture by reduction of said gas at the cathode 4 and regeneration of said gas at the anode 9 is characterised in that one or more substances formed during the cathodic reduction and or the anodic regeneration is or are chemically converted, preferably by catalytic decomposition in a catalytic decomposition compartment 2 , to produce further quantities of said gas, the gas formed by both the anodic regeneration in anodic compartment 3 and the chemical conversion in compartment 2 being recovered as the product. In an especially preferred embodiment a plurality of said cells are used in an apparatus for extracting oxygen from the air by using a cathode 4 comprising high surface area graphite powder which reduces oxygen to produce peroxyl ions, each cell being further provided, externally of the cathode compartment 1 , with means 15 for catalytically decomposing the peroxyl ions produced, suitable catalysts being COFe₂O₄ or NiCO₂O₄.
