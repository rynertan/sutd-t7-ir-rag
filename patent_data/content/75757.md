# Optical weft sensor for a loom.

## Abstract
An optical weft sensor for a loom in which the light emitting and light receiving elements are fixed to the loom frame and only the flexible optical fibers are disposed on the reed frame. Since no shock or vibration is applied to these electronic elements, it is possible to obtain a relatively longlife time, thus improving the sensor reliability. Addition ally, since the weft sensor according to the present invention is supported by a sensor holder, it is possible to readily adjust the sensor position along the reed frame or reed holder when the width of cloth is required to change. The optical weft sensor comprises a LED, a phototransistor, optical fibers, a detection circuit, in addition to the sensor holder.
