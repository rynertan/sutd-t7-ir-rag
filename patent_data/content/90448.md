# Polymers containing organotin compounds and paint on the basis thereof.

## Abstract
The invention concerns marine antifouling paints and tin containing polymers suitable as binder in such paint. The polymers are cyclized rubber containing phenolate groups bound to the skeleton through a carbon carbon bond, wherein the phenolic oxygen is bound to a group SnRâ‚ƒ in which R is a hydrocarbon residue. Such polymers can be used in paint which yields a top coat that is self polishing and remains smooth and free from fouling for a very long time.
