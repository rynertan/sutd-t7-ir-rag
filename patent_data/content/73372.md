# Process for producing 2,6 difluorobenzonitrile.

## Abstract
A process for producing 2,6 difluorobenzonitrile com prises reducing a chloro fluorobenzonitrile selected from 3 chloro 2,6 difluorobenzonitrile, 3,5 dichloro 2,6 difluoro benzonitrile or a mixture thereof by hydrogen gas in the presence of a palladium or platinum catalyst at a temperatu re of 0 to 200 C.
