## Description
Process for joining by heat welding an olefine polymer film to a support sheet of paper like material, and a product for padded packaging obtained by such a process.The present invention relates in general to the manufacture of laminated products obtained by joining an olefine polymer material in sheet form to a support sheet of paper like material.The invention refers more particularly to the manufacture of products for padded packaging comprising one or more polyethylene sheets with air bubbles,joined to one or more support sheets of paper like material.Traditionally for the manufacture of these and like products it is necessary, before proceeding to join the two sheets, to interpose between them an intermediate layer which has a glueing action or is capable of increasing the chemical affinity between the two materials. In particular, since the joining of the two sheets is normally effected by heat welding, it is necessary to coat the joining surface of the sheet of paper like material with a layer of olefine polymer material, generally by fusion and extrusion processes starting with granules of this material. These granules are heated until they melt and are then extruded through a linear extruder,in such a way as to obtain a fused film which is bonded to the paper like support by means of pressure applied by a cylinder and cooled counter cylinder.The necessity of coating the paper like support derives from the fact that the polyolefine resins are, as is known, chemically inert, which has to date prevented any direct joining thereof to the paper using conventional processes of heat welding normally adopted for example, in the field of the manufacture of laminated products for packaging.The necessity of using paper coated with a polyolefine film involves considerable disadvantages due to the cost of the paper thus treated, which leads, on the one hand, to a high selling price for products made therefrom and, on the other hand, to considerable problems of supplying the paper like material thus treated by the manufacturers of such products.The Applicant has now observed, in a surprising manner and in contrast to the prejudices hitherto rooted in this sector of the prior art, that the interposition of an intermediate layer for the purpose of increasing the chemical affinity between the sheet of polyolefine material and the support sheet of paper like material to be joined together is not in fact necessary, provided recourse is had to a particular preliminary treatment of the surfaces of the two sheets intended to be joined together.The main object of the present invention is, therefore, the provision of a process that permits the direct joining of a sheet of olefine polymer material to a support sheet of paper like material. A more particular object of the invention is that of carrying out a process which permits the production of a product for padded packaging by means of the direct joining of a polyethylene sheet with air bubbles to a non polyethylene paper like sheet.A further more particular object of the invention is that of providing a padded envelope formed by two sheets of non polyethylene paperlike material and by two sheets of polyethylene material with air bubbles,interposed between the two sheets of paper like material and having respective margins joined together and directly joined to the corresponding margins of the two sheets of non polyethylene paperlike material.The process according to the invention is characterised in that it includes the operations of subjecting the surfaces of the sheets of olefine polymer material and of the paper like material intended to be joined together to a pretreatment of surface activat to effect a partial oxidation of said surfaces, and directly heat welding together the surfaces thus pretreated.The treatment of surface activation may consist of a direct flame treatment or alternatively, of a corona effect electric discharge treatment. In both the cases there are generated on the sheet surfaces to be joined, functional chemical groups between which chemical bonds may be formed following the heat welding operation.The methods by which these surface activation treatments are conducted are, in any given case, comparable with those adopted in treatments of the same type conducted, for totally different purposes, on polyolefine resin films so as to ensure the firm adhesion of printing inks.It therefore proves possible for the pretreatment phase contemplated in the process according to the invention to be carried out, whether with regard to the polymer material or with regard to the paper like material, by using the same equipment as is available commercially for the treatment prior to printing of polyolefine films.The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an example of a process for the manufacture of a padded envelope illustrated in the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the envelope, andFigure 2 is a transverse sectional view along the line Il Il in Figure 1. The envelope illustrated ip the drawings is conventionally composed of two sheets of polyolefine material with air bubbles 1, 2, each of which in turn comprises in a conventional manner two polyethylene films joined together in a manner known in the prior art, and two outer sheets of paper or thin card 3, 4.The sheets 1 4 are rectangular in form and are joined together by means of heat welding along the two longer sides 5, 6 and along one of the shorter sides 7 of the envelope, whilst they remain separate from each other along the opposite shorter side 8, which therefore constitutes the open end of the envelope.In known envelopes of the type illustrated,the internal faces of the paper or cardboard sheets 3 and 4 are made of polyethylene, in such a way as to permit the joining thereto,by means of heat welding,of the two polyethylene sheets with air bubbles 1 and 2.This is not the case for the envelope illustrated in the example in that, according to the invention, there are no polyethylene film coatings on the internal faces of the paper sheets 3 and 4, nor is there any application of other intermediate materials capable of increasing the chemical affinity between the paper and the polyethylene or of effecting a glueing action. According to the invention the manufacturing process for the envelope provides, however, for a pretreatment of surface activation both of the external faces of the two polyethylene sheets 1 and 2, and of the internal faces of the paper sheets 3 and 4.This surface activation treatment consists in practical terms of achieving a partial oxidation of the surfaces of the sheets 1, 2 and 3, 4 intended to be joined together, in such a way as to generate on these surfaces functional chemical groups between which chemical bonds may be formed upon the successive operation of heat bonding. The surface activation phase may be carried out either by means of a controlled direct flame treatment, or through an electrical discharge treatment by the corona effect,on the said surfaces.In either case, use is made of equipment available commercially and normally used in the field of packaging so as to permit printing, and thus the adhesion of printing inks, on polyolefine resin films.For the direct flame treatment it is possible, for example, to use devices with gas burners produced and marketed by the British companies,WSA COMPONENTS LIMITED and FLYNN BURNER CORPORATION. This equipment generally comprises a conveyor in the path of advance of which there are positioned one or more controlled combustion burners. In the process according to the invention for the manufacture of padded envelopes four such devices are used, including two for the treatment of respective webs of polyethylene with air bubbles and two for respective webs or paper. These webs are successively brought together by means of apparatus conventional in the field of padded envelopes, and successively joined together and subdivided, in the manner hereinafter described, so as to form the sheets 1, 2 and 3, 4 constituting the envelope.For the treatment with electric discharge by the corona effect,use is made of apparatus comprising a high frequency generator and a high voltage generator connected to an electrode. The material to be treated is made to pass through a gap between the electrode and a dielectric support material. In this case also,for the process according to the invention,it is convenient to use four devices, respectively. for the two webs of polyethylene with air bubbles from which the sheets 1 and 2 will be successively formed,and for the webs of paper from which the paper sheets 3 and 4 will be formedApparatus for the corona effect treatment of polyolefine resin films intended to be printed is produced and marketed,for example, by theBritish company AHLBRANDT SYSTEMS, as well as by the Italian companies FERRADINIS BENELLI s.r.l. and SCAE S.p.A.Subsequent to the aforesaid pretreatment, the webs of polyethylene with air bubbles and of paper are matched together in the manner described in the foregoing by means of conventional apparatus,and are joined along their longitudinal edges by means of heat welding. This operation is carried out in a manner known in the art, by means of longitudinal welding bars or by means of heated wheels between which the matched webs are made to pass.Finally there is carried out a transverse heatwelding process at prearranged spatial intervals along the webs, with subsequent transverse cutting of the webs of paper in such a way as to separate the heat welded product from these webs. There is thus clearly obtained the envelope illustrated in the drawings, with the sheets of polyethylene with air bubbles 1, 2 and the sheets of paper 3, 4 directly joined together by means of heat welding along the sides 5, 6 and 7. The process according to the invention is applicable not only to the manufacture of padded envelopes of the type described above, but also to padded packaging of various types, such as, for example, simple padded sheets for the wrapping of packs, formed by a single sheet of polyethylene with air bubbles joined to a sheet of paper. In this case the pretreatment involving surface activation and the subsequent joining by means of heat welding of the two sheets are carried out in a manner entirely analogous to that previously described.In more general terms, the process is applicable to all cases in which it is necessary to join by means of heat welding an olefine polymer sheet or film to a support sheet of paper like material,
