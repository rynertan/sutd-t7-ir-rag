## Abstract
Grinding apparatus 30 for grinding workpieces 33 retained in a holding means 31 comprises two endless abrasive belts 36 guided to move in a direction opposed to the direction of movement of the workpieces 33 . An angularly adjustable support 40 biasses each abrasive belt to converge towards the holding means 31 in the direction of movement of the workpieces 33 and the spac ing of one or both abrasive belts 36 is adjustable in re sponse to the workpiece size sensed by non contact gaug ing means. The holding means 31 may be a disc having apertures 32 therearound and rotatable so that workpieces 33 in the apertures 32 pass between the endless belts 36 to grind the exposed opposed ends of the workpieces 33 .
