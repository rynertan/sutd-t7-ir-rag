# Electrostatic machine incorporating toner scavenging chamber.

## Abstract
An electrostatic machine has a moving photosensitive drum 10 on which electrostatic images are formed and developed by means of toner powder. The developed images are transferred to copy paper and the drum cleaned for re use. The drum 10 carries with it a boundary layer of air in which unwanted loose toner particles are entrained. A scavenging chamber has a mouth to draw air from the boundary layer into a vacuum chamber 47 . The mouth has a lip 46 forming with the drum 10 a venturi passage 48 through which the air flows to expand into the scavenging chamber. A further knife edge lip 49 peels the boundary layer air from the drum.
