## Description
PROCESS FOR THE SEPARATION OF C10 AROMATIC ISOMERS This invention relates to hydrocarbon separations. . More specifically, the claimed invention relates to the separation of a C10 aromatic isomer from a hydro carbon feedstream containing a mixture of Clo aromatic isomers by use of the adsorbent zeolite beta which selectively removes a C10 aromatic isomer from the feedstream. The selectively adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer is removed from the adsorbent through a desorption step. In one embodiment, durene is selectively removed from a mixture of C10 aromatic isomers containing the tetramethylbenzene isomers. In another embodiment, paradiethylbenzene is removed from a mixture of Clo aromatic isomers containing the diethylbenzene isomers.In general, paradiethyl benzene is preferentially adsorbed over the other C10 aromatic isomers. In one embodiment, paradiethyl benzene is preferentially adsorbed over the other C10 aromatic isomers with an order for decreased preference of adsorption on zeolite beta as follows paradiethylbenzene durene metadiethylbenzene orthodiethylbenzene and prehnitene isodurene. It is known in the separation art that certain adsorbents generally comprising crystalline aluminosilicates can be utilized to separate certain hydrocarbons from mixtures thereof. In the separation of aromatic hydrocarbon isomers with certain crystalline aluminosilicates containing selected cations at the zeolitic cationic sites, selectivity of the zeolite for a given aromatic isomer ifs enhanced. This manner of separation is particularly useful when the components to be separated have similar physical properties, such as freezing or boiling points, which renders the components diffi cult to separate by distillation or crystallization. A number of processes describing the separation of paraxylene from a mixture of at least one other xylene isomer utilizing a crystalline aluminosilicate adsorbent, are shown in U.S. PatentNos. 3,558,730, 3,558,732, 3,626,020, and 3,663,638. Other processes which describe the adsorption separation of ethylbenzene from a mixture of xylene isomers utilizing a crystalline alumino silicate adsorbent are shown in U.S. Patent Nos.3,943,182, 3,997,619, 3,998,901, and 4,021,499. U.S. Patent No. 3,793,385 discloses the use of the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite beta to separate C8 aromatic isomers, specifically to separate paraxylene and ethylbenzene from a mixture containing at least one other Cg aromatic isomer. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,398 discloses a process for separating Cg aromatic isomers from a feedstream containing a mixture thereof by contacting the feedstream with a bed of the adsorbent zeolite beta. While the use of various zeolites to separate aromatic isomers is known, and the use of zeolite beta to separate Co aromatic isomers is known, less is known about adsorbents which effectively separate the C10 aromatic isomers. The C10 aromatic isomers are useful in the chemical arts as desorbents in separation processes and as precursors in preparing other chemicals. More specifically, durene is used in organic synthesis and in the manufacture of plasticizers, polymers and fibers, and isodurene is also used in organic synthesis. Paradiethylbenzene is useful as an intermediate or solvent. However, the availability of these C10 aromatic isomers is restricted due to the difficulty of effectively separating a C10 aromatic isomer from a mixture of the C10 aromatic isomers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly a broad objective of this invention to provide a process of separating a C10 aromatic isomer from a hydrocarbon feedstream containing a mixture of C10 aromatic isomers. In brief, the invention comprises an adsorptive separation process for the separation of the C10 aromatic isomers from a hydrocarbon feedstream containing a mixture of Clraromatic isomers by contacting the hydrocarbon feedstream with a bed of the adsorbent zeolite beta. A raffinate stream is then withdrawn from the bed, this stream containing less of the selectively adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer.The adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer on the bed is then desorbed to effect displacement of the isomer, followed by withdrawing from the adsorbent bed an extract stream containing the adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer. The preferred zeolite beta adsorbent is cation exchanged to increase the C10 aromatic selectivity of the adsorbent. In one embodiment, the preferred C10 aromatic isomer is durene. In another embodiment, the preferred isomer is paradiethylbenzene. In general, paradiethylbenzene is preferentially adsorbed over the other C10 aromatic isomers. In one embodiment, paradiethylbenzene is preferentially adsorbed over the other C10 aromatic isomers with an order for decreased preference of adsorption on zeolite beta as follows paradiethylbenzene durene metadiethylbenzene orthodiethylbenzene and prehnitene isodurene. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TBE INVENTION Hydrocarbon feedstreams which can be utilized in the process of this invention contain mixtures of C10 aromatic isomers. Specifically, these include the difficult to separate tetramethylbenzenes and dimethylethylbenzenes, and the diethylbenzenes. The tetramethylbenzene isomers include 1,2,4,S tetramethylbenzene durene , 1,2,3, 5 tetramethylbenzene tetramethylbenzene isodurene , and 1,2,3,4 tetramethylbenzene prehnitene . The diethylbenzene isomers include 1,4 diethylbenzene paradiethylbenzene , 1,3diethylbenzene meta diethylbenzene and 1,2 diethylbenzene ortho diethylbenzene .The close boiling points of these10 aromatic isomers l960C, 1970C and 2040C for the tetramethylbenzene isomers 181, 183, and 184 for the diethylbenzene isomers render the isomers difficult to separate by distillation. Mixtures containing substantial quantities of Clo aromatic isomers and other aromatics generally are produced by reforming processes, processes which are well known to the refining and petrochemical arts. The hydrocarbon feedstream is contacted with a bed of the adsorbent, entitled zeolite beta. Zeolite beta and its method of manufacture are described in U.S. Patent 3,308,069 and its Reissue Patent 28,341 by Wadlinger et al., this disclosure being fully incorporated herein by reference. Also included with our definition of zeolite beta is where the aluminum is fully or partially substituted with the elements of gallium or boron to provide a gallosilicate or borosilicate, or where the silicon is fully or partially substituted with the elements of germanium, titanium or phosphorus but retains the same structure and similar X ray diffraction pattern as defined in the Wadlinger et al. patents. After synthesizing the zeolite beta, it is necessary to calcine the zeolite at a temperature and for a time effective to remove any tetraethylammonium ions remaining after its synthesis. While the zeolite beta composition is fully described in this Wadlinger et al. patent, it has been surprisingly found that zeolite beta can be used to separate Clo aromatic isomers from a feedstream containing a mixture of C10 aromatic isomers. Further, the C10 selectivity can be substantially increased by cation exchanging the zeolite beta with a suitable cation. The process of this invention may be used to separate all the C10 aromatic isomers from one another by the use of various stages or adsorption zones. The preferred separation is of paradiethyl benzene since it is the most strongly adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer. In one embodiment the C10 aromatic isomers are tetramethylbenzenes which are selectively adsorbed in the order of durene and prehnitene isodurene, with either durene or prehnitene being preferentially adsorbed depending upon the particular cation exchanged form of the zeolite beta and the conditions of adsorption. Preferably durene is selectively adsorbed over prehnitene. In another embodiment theC10 aromatic isomers are diethylbenzenes which are selectively adsorbed in the order of paradiethylbenzene metadiethylbenzene and orthodiethylbenzene, with either metadiethylbenzene or orthodiethylbenzene being preferentially adsorbed depending on the particularcation exchanged form of zeolite beta and the conditions of adsorption. In general, paradiethylbenzene is preferentially adsorbed over the other C10 aromatic isomers. In one embodiment, paradiethylbenzene is preferentially adsorbed over the other C10 aromatic isomers with an order for decreased preference of adsorption on zeolite beta as follows paradiethylbenzene durene metadiethyl benzene orthodiethylbenzene and prehnitene isodurene. In order to substantially increase the selectivity of the adsorbent for C10 aromatic isomers, the adsorbent which is available in its tetraethylammonium TEA sodium form is preferablycation exchanged. After the TEA is removed the hydrogen sodium form of zeolite beta can be exchanged with suitable cations which include base metal or transition metal cations, such as copper, rubidium, nickel, manganese, zinc, cobalt, potassium, cerium, barium, and cesium or mixtures thereof or other cations, such as ammonium. The preferred cations for increased selectivity of durene are hydrogen, sodium, cobalt and manganese with the most preferred cation being sodium. The preferred cation for increased selectivity of paradiethylbenzene is sodium. The zeolite beta can be exchanged with sodium by use of a spdium salt or by caustic treatment with sodium hydroxide. The zeolite beta adsorbent can be combined with a binder, such as natural or synthetic clays e.g., Kaolin , and inorganic oxides and can be in any form acceptable to the separation process such as extrudates, spheres, granules or tablets. Certain characteristics of adsorbents are highly desirable, if not absolutely necessary, to the successful operation of a selective adsorption process. Among such characteristics are adsorptive capacity for some weight of the C10 aromatic isomer per weight of adsorbent and the selective adsorption of a C10 aromatic isomer with respect to a raffinate component and the desorbent material. Capacity of the adsorbent for adsorbing a specific volume of C10 aromatic isomer is, of course, a necessity without such capacity the adsorbent is useless for adsorptive separation. Furthermore, the higher the adsorbent s capacity for the C10 aromatic isomer, the better is the adsorbent. Increased capacity of a particular adsorbent makes it possible to reduce the amount of adsorbent needed to separate the C10 aromatic isomer contained in a particular charge of feed mixture. A reduction in the amount of adsorbent required for a specific adsorptive separation reduces the cost of the separation process. It is important that the good initial capacity of the adsorbent be maintained during actual use in the separation process over some economically desirable life.Generally, the adsorbent of this invention has a capacity of at least 3 of hydrocarbon by weight of adsorbent and preferably greater than 58 of hydrocarbon by weight of adsorbent. The second necessary adsorbent characteristic is the ability of the adsorbent to separate components of the feed or, in other words, that the adsorbent possess adsorptive selectivity, oc , for one component as compared to another component. Relative selectivity can be expressed not only for one feed component as compared to another but can also be expressed between any feed mixture component and the desorbent material. The separation factor, or , r as used throughout this specification is defined as the ratio of the two components of the adsorbed phase over the ratio of the same two components in the unadsorbed phase at equilibrium conditions. Relative selectivity is shown as Equation 1 below weight C weight D B Selectivity oC r Eweight C weight DiU where C and D are two components of the feed represented by weight, and the subscripts A and U represent the adsorbed and unadsorbed phases, respectively. The equilibrium conditions were determined when the feed passing over a bed of adsorbent did not change composition after contacting the bed of adsorbent. In other words, there was no net transfer of material occuring between the unadsorbed and adsorbed phases. Where selectivity of two components approaches 1.0 there is no preferential adsorption of one component by the adsorbent with respect to the other they are both adsorbed or nonadsorbed to about the same degree with respect to each other. As the selectivity OC becomes less than or greater than 1.0 there is preferential adsorption by the adsorbent for one component with respect to the other. When comparing the selectivity by the adsorbent of one component C over component D, an oC larger than 1.0 indicates preferential adsorption of component C within the adsorbent. An oC less than 1.0 would indicate that component D is preferentially adsorbed leaving an unadsorbed phase richer in component C and an adsorbed phase richer in component D.For optimum performance desorbent materials should have a selectivity equal to about 1 or less than 1 with respect to all extract components so that all of the extract components can be extracted as a class and all raffinate components clearly rejected into the raffinate stream. When the adsorbent of this invention is cation exchanged it is preferably exchanged with a cation which will impart an oC separation factor of at least 2.0 of the C10 aromatic isomer component C over at least one of the other components component D of the hydrocarbon feedstream. In order to test the various cation exchanged zeolite beta adsorbent materials with a particular feed mixture to measure the characteristics of adsorptive capacity and selectivity, a static testing procedure was employed. The procedure consisted of contacting a known weight of adsorbent with a known weight of mixed hydrocarbon feedstream.After allowing this mixture to reach equilibrium, a sample was removed and analyzed by gas chromatography. The amount of isomers in the raffinate were measured and the amount of isomers adsorbed were obtained by difference from the standard feedstream. In a separation process, after the hydrocarbon feedstream is contacted with the bed of adsorbent, a raffinate stream is withdrawn from the adsorbent bed, this stream containing less of the selectively adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer of the feedstream. Then the adsorbed aromatic isomer on the bed is desorbed to effect displacement thereof. The e desorbing step which can be used in the various processing schemes employing this adsorbent will vary depending on the type of operation employed. The term wdesorbent material as used herein shall mean any fluid substance capable of removing a selectively adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer from the adsorbent. In the swingbed system in which the selectively adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer is removed from the adsorbent by a purge stream, desorbent materials comprising gaseous hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, etc., or other types of gases such as nitrogen or hydrogen may be used at elevated temperatures or reduced pressures or both to effectively purge the adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer from the adsorbent. However, in an adsorptive separation process which employs the adsorbent and which is generally operated at substantially constant pressures and temperatures to insure a liquid phase, the desorbent material relied upon must he judiciously selected to satisfy several criteria. First, the desorbent material must displace the C10 aromatic isomer from the adsorbent with reasonable mass flow rates without itself being so strongly adsorbed as to unduly prevent the C10 aromatic isomer from displacing the desorbent material in a following adsorption cycle. Expressed in terms of the selectivity, it is preferred that the adsorbent be more selective for aC10 aromatic isomer with respect to a raffinate e.g., other isomers , than it is for the desorbent material with respect to a raffinate.Secondly, desorbent materials must be compatible with the particular adsorbent and the particular feedstream. More specifically they must not reduce or destroy the critical selectivity of the adsorbent for the C10 aromatic isomer with respect to the raffinate. Desorbent materials to be used in the process of this invention should additionally be substances which are easily separable from the feedstream that is passed into the process. After desorbing the C10 aromatic isomer of the feed, both desorbent material and the C10 aromatic isomers are removed in a mixture from the adsorbent. Without a method of separating the desorbent material, such as distillation, the purity of either the C10 aromatic isomer or the raffinate component would not be very high. It is therefore contemplated that any desorbent material used in this process will have a substantially different average boiling point than that of the feedstream.The use of a desorbent material having a substantially different average boiling point than that of the feed allows separation of desorbent material from feed components in the extract and raffinate streams by simple fractionation, thereby permitting reuse of desorbent material in the process. The term substantially different as used herein shall mean that the difference between the average boiling points between the desorbent material and the feed mixture shall be at least about 150F. The boiling range of the desorbent material may be higher or lower than that of the feed mixture. In a liquid phase operation of the process of our invention, desorbent materials comprising mono aromatic hydrocarbons are effective. Mixtures of the aromatic hydrocarbon with paraffins are also effective as desorbent materials. Such paraffins must be compatible with the adsorbent and feedstream as described above and must be easily separated from the feedstream. The paraffins can include straight or branched chain paraffin. such as heptane or cycloparaffins which meet these criteria. Typical concentrations of aromatics in such mixtures can be from a few volume percent up to 100 volume of the total desorbent material mixture but such concentra tions preferably will be within the range of from about 50 volume 8 to about 100 volume 8 of the mixture.The desorbents may be benzene, alkylbenzene, polyalkylbenzenes such as diethylbenzene, and dlmethyl benzenes or xv. lenes, or more generally polycyclic hydrocarbons, etc., and mixtures thereof. The suitable desorbents include toluene and ethyltoluenes, with metaxylene or orthoxylene pre ferred as they provide increased separation and resolution of separation of the C10 aromatic.isosers. Following desorption, the extract stream containing the C10 aromatic isomer is withdrawn fro the adsorbent bed. Depending on the separation factor oC this withdrawn extract can contain rela tively pure fractions of C10 aromatic isomer. However, it will be appreciated that the selectively adsorbed component is generally not completely adsorbed by the adsorbent, nor is the raffinate component generally completely non adsorbed by the adsorbent. In general, this adsorptive separation process can be carried out in the vapor or liquid phase, while the liquid phase is preferable. Adsorp tive conditions for the process of this invention may include temperatures within the range of from about ambient to about 3000C and will include pressees in the range fran about ataxWberic to about 3447.5 kPa 500 psig . In a preferred embodiment the process is carried out in the liquid phase at temperatures of 90 2000C to lower the viscosity of the feedstream allowing for an increased flow rate or a reduction in the diameter of the adsorption column. Desorption conditions for the process of this invention shall generally include the same range of temperatures and pressures as described for the adsorption operation. The desorption of the selectively adsorbed C10 aromatic isomer could also be effected at subatmospheric pressures or elevated temperatures or both, or by vacuum purging of the adsorbent to remove the adsorbed isomer, but this process is not primarily directed to these desorption methods. Example I A crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite beta adsorbent in its hydrogen form was cation exchanged with the cations as listed in Table I the NaOH in parentheses indicates Na exchange was carried out with NaOE instead of a sodium salt . A C10 aromatic feedstream containing 1 of durene, 2 of isodurene, 2 of prehnitene, and 0.5 of triisopropyl benzene an internal standard for the gas chromatograph with the remainder heptane, all by weight, was added at ambient temperature to the various cation exchanged zeolite beta adsorbents, with the amount of feedstream being in excess of that which the zeolite can adsorb. After allowing this mixture to reach equilibrium, the mixture was allowed to settle and a sample was removed and analyzed by gas chromatography.The amount of C10 isomers in the raffinate was measured and the amount of isomers adsorbed was obtained by difference from the standard feedstream. The capacity and the OC separation factor were calculated for the tetramethylbenzene isomers as listed in Table I.

Example IV A sample of a C10 aromatic feedstream containing equimolar amounts of durene, isodurene, prehnitene and metaxylene was added to a sodium exchanged aluminosilicate zeolite beta adsorbent at various temperatures in an amount equal to the capacity of the adsorbent. After agitation to reach equilibrium a gas phase sample was removed and analyzed by gas chromatography.
