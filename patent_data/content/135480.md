## Description
Roots type rotary positive displacement compressorThe present invention relates to a hoots type rot.ary positive displacement compressor comprising twc contra rotating rotor with shafts which carry at one end two gear wheels meshed with each other for transmitting rotation from one rotor to the other, in which the shaft of one of the rotors carries a drive member for coupling with drive means for the compressor.More particularly, this invention constitutes an improvement over Italian Patent Application No. 67502 A 82 filed by the same Applicants on 15th April 1982 and laid open for public inspection on 15thOctober 1983, in which the gear wheels are rencerec rigid for rotation with the respective shafts by means of simple axial friction clamping means.In this Application, the axial clamping means comprise locking nuts screwed onto corresponding screw threaded parts of the respective shafts and bearing frontally against the gear wheels.With this type of solution, which makes the manufacture of the compressor simpler and more economical while at the same time allowing the achievement of a rore precise phasing between the two rotors and their respective gear wheels during assembly of the compressor, there may arise the disadvantage that a phase displacement occurs between the two rotors and their gear wheels after prolonged usage of the compressor uncer anomalous operational conditions. In fact, it has been found that this dephasing is duemainly to a bedding of the surfaces witha loss of the clamping torque of the nut screwed onto the shaft of the rotor to which the drive member is connected. The object of the present en t ion, therefore fore to avoid this disadvantage and to provide a compressor of the aforesaid type whict e able to ensure the correct phasing of the two rotors and their gear wheels in a reliable ane durable nanflrr In order to achieve this ot,5ect, the present invention provides a rotary positive displacement compressor of the type defined initially, characterised in that the rotor with which the drive member is associated and its saft are formed th a central axial throughhole in which is inserted a tie rod with screw threaded ends onte whnc. respective clamping nuts are screwed to clamp the respective gear wheel fer rotation with the shaft of the rotor.The use cf a tie rod allows te achievement of higher axial clamping load on the gear wheel, which is due also to the axial resilient action of the tie rod under traction which allows more secure locking of this gear wheel to be ensured in practice, and hence ensures that the correct phasing of the compressor is maintained with time.According to the invention, the drive member for the compressor 5 rendered rigid for rotation with the shaft of the rotor by means of the tie rodThis characteristic makes the manufacture of the compressor even simpler and more economical and makes its use for the supercharging of internal combustion engines of motor vehicles particularly advantageous.The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the appended drawing which is provided purely by way of non limiting example and illustrates a rotary positive displacement compressor according to the invention in partial axial section. In the drawing, a Roots type rotary positive displacement compressor for supercharging an internal combustion engine for motor vehicles is genera y indicated 10. The compressor 10 includes a casing 11 having external fins, not shown, in which there are rotatably mounted two double lobed rotors 12, 14 of known type, the respective shafts 16,18 of which are supported for rotation by a pair of end walls 20, 22 applied and sealed to the opposite ends of the casing 11. Two removable covers, 26 and 28 respectively, are fitted to the two support walls 20, 22.The rotational support of the two shafts 16, 18 by the end walls 20, 22 is achieved b respective roiling bearings 30, 32 with which lipped sealing washers 34, 36 are associated.Two gear wheels 38, 40 having the same diameters are mounted on the ends of the shafts 16, 18 nearer the end wall 20 and are meshed with each other. Furthermore, this end of the shaft 16 passes through and is sealed in the cover 26, and carries a toothed pulley 42 for connection by means of a toothed belt to a drive member constituted, for example, by the shaft of the engine with which the compressor 10 is associated or the timing shaft of this engine.The locking of the gear wheels 38, 40 for rotation with the respective shafts 16, 18 is effected by means of simple axial friction clamping. In the case of the gear 40, this clamping is achieved by means of a nut 44 screwed directly onto a screw threaded end part 18a of the shaft 18 and tightened fully against the gear 40 with the interposition of a washer 46. The coupling of the pear 38 for rotation with the shaft 16, however, achieved, according to the invention, ty means of a tie rod 48 which passes through a central axial through hole 50 formed in the rotor 12 and its shaft . The tie rod 48 has screw threaded enos 48a, 48L onto which are screwed respective clamping nuts 52, 54. The nut 54, that is, the one located nearer the end wa it, is fully tightened against the corresponding end of the shaft 16 with the interposition of a washer 56.The other nut 52, that is, the one located nearer the end wall 20, fully tightened against tthe other end of the shaft and against the hub 42a of the toothed pulley 42. with the interposition of a washer 58. The hub 42a passes through the cover 26 and its inner end bears frontal against the gear wheel 38 to clamp it axial against the inner ring of the bearing 30. It will thus be c ear that the tightening of the nut 52 on the end LÃ  of the tie rod 48 clamps the pulley 42 for rotation with the shaft 16 and at the same time clamps the snaft 16 for rotation with the gear wheel 38 clamped axially between the hub 42a and the inner ring of the bearing 30. Naturally, the value of the torque achieved by the nut 52 and the nut 54 must be such as t ensure the necessary axial clamping load on the gear wheel 38.The operation of phasing the rotors 12, 14 and their gear wheels 38, 40 curing assembly of the compressor 10 are effectec in a manner much the same as that described in Italian Patent Application No. 67502 A 82, mentioned above.
