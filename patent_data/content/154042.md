# Improvements relating to the production of developed electrostatic images.

## Abstract
Developed electrostatic images are obtained with an apparatus illustrated in figure 1, and which includes a means 13 which functions during the performance of a string of copying cycles, i.e. a series of copying cycles which follow immediately one after another, to automatically register the number of performed copying cycles of such string as they are performed and to yield output signals indicative of the registered number, A means 17 which functions to register the period of time elapsing between any two immediately successive strings of copying cycles and to yield output signals indicative of such a period of time, an electronic control means 9 which functions in dependence upon said output signals from means i and ii to automatically control the voltage level of the corona source 4 to effect charging of the photoconductive layer 2 at the start of a copying cycle so that said voltage level is varied from one cycle to another in a way which at least partly compensates for variations in the chargeability of the photoconductive layer attributable to fatigue and dark re covery.
