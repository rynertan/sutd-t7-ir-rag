## Description
BIS ALKYILPHOSPHONIUM SALTS OF N PHOSPHOME mYELYC INE Background of the Invention This invention relates to bis alkylphosphonium salts of N phosphonomethylglycine, compounds which have been found to be effective herbicide and plant growth regulators. Herbicides are widely used by farrers, commercial aqricultural companies, and other industries in order to increase crop yields for such staple crops as corn, soybeans, rice, and the like, and to eliminate weed growth along hiqhways, railroad riqhts of way, and other areas. Herbicides are effective in killings or controlling unwanted weeds which compete for soil nutrients with the crop plants, and by reason of the fact that they kill weeds, are responsible for improving the aesthetic appearance of highway and railroad rights of way. There are a number of different types of herbicides presently sold commercially, and these fall into two qeneral categories.The cateqories are pre emergence and post emergence herbicides. The pre emergence herbicides are normally incorporated into the soil prior to the emergence of the weed plants fran the soil, and the post emergence herbicides are normally applied to plant surfaces after emerqence of the weeds or other unwanted plants fran the soil. One of the earliest post emergence herbicides used commercially was 2,4 D 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . After a number of years of use of this and similar compounds such as 2,4,5 T 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxy acetic acid , it was found that certain decomposition products of these herbicides were long lastinq and were not biodegradable. While there has been some dispute between governmental agencies and commercial interests regarding the effects of or residual products of 2,4 D, 2,4, 5 T and similar compounds, the agencies nevertheless restricted the use of these herbicides in the United States some years aqo. Since that time, efforts have been made to develop heµsstcides which are biodegradable into harmless residues within a relatively short time after their application. One such compound, which has been found to be biodegradable, yet which is effective as a herbicide and plant growth regulator when employed at lower rates, is phosphonomethylglycine and various salts thereof.N PeFxqibanamethylqlycine and certain agriculturally effective salts have been approved for use by the U.S. Government, and, as a consequence, this herbicide has become coarercially successful. The N phosphonomethylglycine and certain salts are the only effective and approved post emergence herbicides in the field. The present commercial capound is the isopropylamine salt of N phosphonomethyl glycine and derivatives thereof. In field use it is normally applied in amounts of from 0.01 to about 20 pounds per acre, preferably from 2 to 6 pounds per acre. THE PRIOR ART N Phsphonarethylglycines, and certain soluble salts thereof, can be made in a number of different ways. One such method, as described in U.S. Patent 3,t60,632 Tby et al., December 8, 1964 is to reactN phosphinomethylglycine glycinemethylenephosphinic acid with mercuric chloride in a water solvent at reflux temperature, and subsequently separating the reaction products. Other methods include the reaction of ethyl qlycinate with formaldehyde and diethylphosphite. The latter method is described in U.S.Patent Nt. 3,799,758 Franz, March 26, 1974 . In addition, there is a whole series of patents, relatina to N phosphono methylglycines, their salts, and derivatives thereof, described as being useful herbicides and plant growth regulators. Such additional patents relating to the N phosphonomethylglycines, methods of application, methods of preparation, salts, and derivatives, include U.S. Patent 3,868,407,U.S. Patent 4,197,254, and U.S. Patent 4,199,354, among others. Specific salts of N phoshonomethylglycine which have been disclosed to be herbicidally effective are the sulfonium and sulfoxoniun salts, as described in U.S. Patent Nbs. 4,315,765 and 4,376,644. Other salts are constantly beinq souqht which are more economically and agriculturally efficient or cost effective than those previously known, or are easier to produce. Description of the Invention It has now been discovered that certain new and novel bis alkyl phosphonium salts of N phosphonomethylglycine have good herbicidal and plant growth regulating activity. The bis alkylphosphonium salts of N phosphonomethylglycine which are the subject of this invention have the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same and are selected from the group consisting of saturated or unsaturated alkyl qroups having from 2 to 5 carbon atones. Representative salts fallinq within the scope of the qeneric formula indicated above include the bis tetrabutylphosphoniun salt of N phosphonomethylglcyine, the bis tetramethyl salt of N phosphonomethylglycine, the bis tetra n propyl salt of N phosphonomethylqlycine, and the bis tetrapentyl salt of N phosphonomethylqlycine. The most preferred salt is the bis tetrabutylphosphoniun salt of N phosphonomethylglycine. All of the salts described above can be produced by reactinq N phosphonomethylglycine with an appropriate alkylphosphoni un halide in the presence of silver oxide and filtering the insoluble silver halide precipitated as a consequence of the reaction, leaving the bis alkylphosphonium salt of N phosphonomethylglycine in solution. In producing the compounds of the invention, the alkylphosphoni ura halide and the N phosphonomethylqlycine are first placed in a reaction vessel, and the silver oxide is thereafter admixed therewith incrementally. The mole ratio of alkylphosphonium halide to N phosphonomethyl glycine used to produce the compound is about 2 1. Sufficient silver oxide is used to cause precipitation, and normally to moles of silver chide are used. The function of the silver oxide is to oonvert the N phosphono methylglycine to an anion form, with the concommitant precipitation of silver halide from the solution, thus leaving in solution the anionicN phosphonomethylglycine and the cationic alkylphosphoniun ion. Preferred lower alkylphosphonium halides used to produce the compounds of the invention include the tetrabutyphoniumphonium iodide. This compound can be purchased commercially. N phosphonomethylglycine is a knows compound and can be produced as described in U.S. Patent 3,160,632, low or can be purchased commercial ly from the Monsanto CbmQany, St. Louis, Missouri. This invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Bis tetrabutylphosphoniun salt of N Phosphonomethylglycine A round bottom flask was obtained, and into this flask was charged 8.1 grams g 0.24 mole of tetrabutylphosphonium bromide and 3.0 g 0.12 mole of N phosphonomethylglycine in one hundred milliliters ml anhydrous methanol. Six grams 0.26 mole of silver oxide was then added in portions over a 45 minute time period. After the silver oxide addition was completed, the solution was stirred rapidly for 6 hours at 25 C. The solution was thereafter filtered and the filter cake was washed with methanol. The filtrate was then vacuum stripped, yielding a dark oil which was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and infra red IR techniques as being the bis te trabutylphoi tin salt of N phosphonomethylglycine. Similar techniques can be used to produce the other bis alkyl phosphoniiin salts described herein. EXAMPLE 2 Herbicidal Activity Tests This example offers herbicidal activity test data to show the effectiveness of the compounds of the invention. The effect is observed by comparing the extent of weed control in test flats treated with the bis alkyl phosphoniun salts of N phosphonomethylglycine against that occurring in similar control flats. The e soil used in these tests was a sandy loam soil fran the Livermore, Ca. area. Also added to the soil was 17 17 17 fertilizer N P205 K2O weight basis , amounting to 50 ppm by weight with respect to the soil, and 100 ppn Captan, a soil fungicide. The treated soil was then placed in aluminum flats which were 3 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 8 inches long 7.6 x 10.2 x 20.3 cm . The soil was tamped and leveled with a row marker to impress six rows across the width of the flat. The test weeds were as follows COMMON NAME SCIENTIFIC NAMEBroadleaf Weeds A. annual inorningglory Ipomoea purpurea B. velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti C. mustard Brassica sp.Grasses D. yellow nutsedge Cyperus exculentus E. foxtail Setaria sp. F. watergrass Echinochloa crusqalli G. wild oat Avena fatua Sufficient seeds were planted to produce several seedlinqs per inch in each row. The flats were then placed in a greenhouse maintained at 70 to 85 F 21 to 30 C and watered daily by sprinkler. Chemical application is made by spraying 10 days after plantinq. The spray solution is prepared by dissolving 48 mg of herbicide compound in 20 ml of acetone containing 1 Tweeny 20 polyoxysorbitan monolaurate , then addinq 20 ml of water to the resulting solution. The solution is sprayed at 25 gallons acre, resulting in a 4 lb acre rate of chemical application. Aporoximately 12 14 days after treatment, the degree of weed control was estimated and recorded as percentage control compared to the growth of the same species in an untreated check flat of the same age.The rating scale ranges from 0 to 100 , where 0 equals no effect with plant growth equal to the untreated control, and 100 equals complete kill. The results are listed in Table I below. It is clear from the results shown that the compounds of this invention are effective herbicides. TABLE I HERBIClus TEST RESULTS Apply.

Typical formulations contain additional ingredients or diluent carriers which are either inert or active. Exam plebs of such ingredients or carriers are water, organic solvents, dust carriers, granular carriers, surface active agents, oil and water, wateroil emulsions, wetting aqents, dispersing agents, and emulsifying agents.The herbicidal formulations generally take the form of dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, granules and pellets, or microcapsules.A. DUSTS Dusts are dense powder compositions which are intended for application in dry form. Dusts are characterized by their free flowins and rapid settlinq properties so that they are not readily windborne to areas where their presence is not desired. They contain primarily an active material and a dense, free flowing, solid carrier. Their performance is somçtimes aided by the inclusion of a wettinq agent, and convenience in manufacture frequently demands the inclusion of an inert, absorptive grinding aid. For the dust compositions of this invention, the inert carrier may be either of vegetable or mineral origin, the wetting agent is preferably anionic or nonionic, and suitable absorptive grinding aids are of mineral origin. Suitable classes of inert solid carriers for use in the dust compositions are those organic or inorganic powders which possess hiqh bulk density and are very free flowing. They are also characterized by low surface area and poor liquid absorptivity. Suitable grinding aids are natural clays, diatomaceous earths, and synthetic mineral fillers derived fram silica or silicate. Amonq ionic and nonionic wetting aqents, the most suitable are the members of the qroup known to the art as wetting agents and emulsifiers. Although solid aqents are preferred because of ease of incorporation, some liquid nonionic agents are also suitable in the dust formulations. Preferred dust carriers are micaceous talcs, pyrophyllite, dense kaolin clays, tobacco dust and ground calcium phosphate rock. Preferred grinding aids are attapulgite clay, diatomaceous silica, synthetic fine silica and synthetic calcium and magnesium silicates. Most preferred wetting agents are alkylbenzene and alkyl naph thalene sulfonates, sulfate fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, lonq chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, and ditertiary acetylenic glycols. Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, liqnin sulfonates, polymeric alkylnaphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalenesulfonate, polymethylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate, and sodiun N methyl N lonq chain acid taurates. The inert solid carriers in the dusts of this invention are usually present in concentrations of from about 30 to 90 weight percent of the total composition. The grinding aid will usually constitute 5 to 50 weight percent of the compositions, and the wetting anent will constitute fran about 0 to 1.0 weiqht percent of the oomposition. Dust oompositions can also contain other surfactants such as dispersing aqents in concentra tions of up to about 0.5 weight percent, and minor amounts of anticaking and antistatic agents. The particle size of the carrier is usually in the ranqe of 30 to 50 microns.B. EMU1SIFINBLE CONCENTRATES Emulsifiable concentrates are usually solutions of the active materials in nonwater miscible solvents together with an emulsifying agent. Prior to use, the concentrate is diluted with water to form a suspended emulsion of solvent droplets. Typical solvents for use in erulsifiable concentrates include weed oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and nonwater niscible ethers, esters, and ketones. Typical emulsifyinq aqents are anionic or nonionic surfactants, or mixtures of the two. Examples include long chain alkyl or mercaptan polyethoxy alcohols, alkylaryl polyethoxy aloohols, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene ethers with sorbitan fatty acid esters, polycxy ethylene glycol esters with fatty or rosin acids, fatty alkylol amide condensates, calcium and gamine salts of fatty alcohol sulfates, oil soluble petroleum sulfonates, or preferably mixtures of these emulsifying agents. Such emulsifyinq agents will comprise from about 1 to 10 weight percent of the total composition. Thus, emulsifiable concentrates of the present invention will consist of from about 15 to about 50 weight percent active material, about 40 to 82 weight percent solvent, and about 1 to 10 weiqht percent emulsifier. Other additives such as spreading agents and stickers can also be included.C. GRANULES AND PELLETS Granules and pellets are physically stable, particulate compositions containing the active ingredients adherinq to or distributed through a basic matrix of a coherent, inert carrier with macroscopic dimensions.A typical particle is about 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. Surfactants are often present to aid in leachinq of the active ingredient from the granule or pellet. The carrier is preferably of mineral oriqin, and qenerally falls within one of two types. The first are porous, absorptive, preformed granules, such as preformed and screened granular attapulqite or heat expanded, granular, screened vermiculite. On either of these, a solution of the active agent can be sprayed and will be absorbed at concentrations up to 25 weight percent of the total weight. The second, which are also suitable for pellets, are initially powdered kaolin clays, hydrated attapulgite, or bentonite clays in the form of sodium, calcium, or magnesium bentonites. Water soluble salts, such as sodium salts, may also be present to aid in the disintegration of granules or pellets in the presence of moisture.These ingredients are blended with the active components to give mixtures that are granulated or pelleted, followed by drying, to yield formulations with the active component distributed uniformly throughout the mass. Such granules and pellets can also be made with 25 to 30 weight percent active component, but more frequently a concentration of about 10 weight percent is desired for optimum distribution. The granular compositions of this invention are most useful in a size ranqe of 1530 mesh. The surfactant is qenerally a common wetting agent of anionic or nonionic character. The most suitable wetting agents depend upon the type of granule used. When preformed granules are sprayed with active material in liquid form the most suitable wetting agents are nonionic, liquid wetters miscible with the solvent. These are compounds most qenerally known in the art as emulsifiers, and comprise alkylaryl polyether alcohols, alkyl polyether alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol esters with fatty or rosin acids, fatty alkylol amide condensates, oil solution petroleum or vegetable oil sulfonates, or mixtures of these. Such agents will usually comprise up to about 5 weight percent of the total composition. When the active inqredient is first mixed with a powdered carrier and subsequently granulated, or pelleted, liquid nonionic wetters can still be used, but it is usually preferable to incorporate at the mixing staae one of the solid, powdered anionic wetting agents such as those pre 7iously listed for the wettable powders. Such agents will comprise from about O to 2 weight percent of the total composition. Thus, the preferred granular or pelleted formulations of this invention comprise about 5 to 30 percent by weight active material, about o to 5 weiqht percent wetting agent, and about 65 to 95 weiqht percent inert material carrier, as these terms are used herein. D. MICROCxPsrvss Microcapsules consist of fully enclosed droplets or granules mntaining the active materials, in which the enclosinq material is an inert porous membrane, arranged to allow escape of the enclosed materials to the surrounding medium at controlled rates over a specified period.Encapsulated droplets are typically about 1 to 50 microns in diameter. The enclosed liquid typically constitutes about 50 to 95 of the weight of the entire capsule, and may contain a snall amount of solvent in addition to the active materials. Encapsulated granules are characterized by porous membranes sealing the openings of the granule carrier pores, trappinq the liquid containing the active components inside for controlled release. A typical granule size ranges from 1 millimeter to 1 centimeter in diameter. In agricultural usage, the granule size is generally about 1 to 2 millimeteLs in diameter. Granules formed by extrusion, agglomeration, or prilling are useful in the present invention as well as materials in their naturally occurring form. Examples of such carriers are vermiculite, sintered clak granules, kaolin, attapulgite clay, sawdust, and granular carbon. Useful encapsulating materials include natural and synthetic rubbers, cellulosic materials, styrene butadiene copolymers, polyacrylonitriles, polyacrylates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, and starch xanthates.E. IN GENERAL Each of the above formulations can be prepared as a packaqe containing the herbicide together with the other inqredients of the formulation diluents, emulsifiers, surfactants, etc. . The formulations can also be prepared by a tank mix method, in which the inqredients are obtained separately and combined at the qrower site. In general, any conventional method of application can be used. The locus of application can be soil, seeds, seedlings, or the actual plants, as well as flooded fields. Post emergence application is preferred.Dusts and liquid compositions can be applied by the use of powder dusters, boan and hand sprayers, and spray dusters. The compositions can also be applied from airplanes as dusts and sprays because they are effective in very low dosages. In order to modify or control the growth of germinating seeds or emerging seedlings, as a typical example, the dust and liquid compositions are applied to the soil accordions to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least one half inch below the soil surface. It is not necessary that the phytotoxic compositions be admixed with the soil particles. Instead, these compositions can be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil.The phytotoxic compositions of this invention can also be applied by addition to irriqation water supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. Dust compositions, granular compositions or liquid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discinq, dragging or mixing operations. The herbicide compositions can also be applied to the soil through irriqation systems. According to this technique, the compositions are added directly to irrigation water immediately prior to irriqation of the field. This technique is applicable in all geographical areas regardless of rainfall, since it permits supplementation of the natural rainfall at critical stages of plant growth. In a typical application, the concerr tration of the herbicide composition in the irriqation water will range from about 10 to 150 parts per million by weiqht. The irrigation water can be applied by the use of sprinkler systems, surface furrows, or flooding. Such application is most effectively done before the weeds qermin ate, either early in the spring prior to germination or within to days after cultivation of the field. The amount of the present composition which constitutes a herbicidally effective amount depends upon the nature of the seeds or plants to be controlled. The rate of application of active inqredient varies fran about 0.01 to about 50 pounds per acre, preferably about 0.1 to about 25 pounds per acre with the actual amount depending on the overall cost and the desired results. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that compositions exhibiting lower herbicidal activity will require a higher dosage than more active compounds for the same degree of control.
