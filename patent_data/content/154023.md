## Description
FIXED GEOMETRY ROCKET THRUST CHAMBER WITH VARIABLE EXPANSION RATIOBackground of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to rocket thrust chambers and more particularly to fixed geometry rocket thrust chambers having means for varying their nozzle expansion ratios. 2. The Prlor Art In the past, it was almost universal practice to use staged launch vehicles for orbital or extra orbital space missions such that the englnes of each stage could be equipped with nozzles having expansion ratios befitting the prevailing ambient pressure conditions and performance requirements for the particular stage. Since first stage engines bhad to be operable at sea level ambient conditions, they were commonly equlpped with nozzles having a moderate expansion ratlo, whereas those of the upper stages were commonly equipped wlth nozzles having much higher expansion ratios. With today s unstaged launch systems, problems arise as to how to optimalize the engine s of the launch vehicle so that it can operate efficiently both at the launch pad and in space. The problem is two fold in that an engine whose expansion ratio is optimal at launch Is grossly underexpansive in space. Secondly, an englne which is sized for launch will be too big for use in space and will overaccelerate the space vehicle and or its occupants if it is operated at full thrust in the latter phases of the launch.So far, the choice has been to use fluxed geometry engines which have intermediate expansion ratlos however, this solution causes the engines to suffer performance penalties from overexpanslon at launch and fro under expansion at all other phases of thelr mission. Of course, practitioners of the prior art have attempted to resolve the above problems by unflxlng the geometry of the nozzle by means of using deployable nozzle sections or inflatable, extendable nozzle plugs or other mechanical means for changing the contour of the nozzle, the idea being that once the rocket motor reaches space, the geometry of its nozzle could be changed to give the desired greater nozzle ratio. However, these devices add great weight and complication to the rocket motor, and are subJect to fallure because of the hostility of their working environment.ObJects of the Invention It ts therefore an object of the present invention to provide a rocket motor which can provide optimum nozzle expanslon both at launch and in space without wadding weight, complication, or risk of failure. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a rocket motor which can be operated at high propellant flow rates and thrust during initial ascent and also be operated at low propellant flow rates wlth fuller expansion and optimal thrust performance tn space. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a rocket motor which can provide the above recited advantages with a fixed geometry nozzle.Summary of the Invention These and other objects are accompllshed by the present invention which provides a rocket thrust chamber comprising a combustor with a fixed divergent profile, a nozzle for further expanding the output of the divergent combustor and a hlgh velocity, throttleable injector for injecting propellants into the divergent combustor at such an initial velocity and initially rapid axlal burning rate that the injected propellants achieve sonic flow conditions at preselected locations within the dlvergent combustor according to the throttle setting of the RTI ID 3.9 injector. In operation, the throttle setting fixes the location of the sonic flow line within the divergent combustor, and the ratio of the effective area of the divergent combustor at the sonic location with respect to the nozzle exit area fixes the expansion ratio for that throttle setting. At launch, the engine delivers a high propellant flow rate and a moderate expanslon ratio, while in space, it delivers a low propellant flow rate and a far greater expansion ratio. Thusly, the thrust chamber of the present invention can be tailored to provide optimal performance at all phases of the launch. Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.Brief Descrlotton of the Drawing Figure 1 is a cross sectional side view of a fixed geometry, varlable arca thrust chamber constructed according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.

The same elements or parts throughout the figures of the drawing are designated by the same reference characters, while equtvalent elements bear a prime designation. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments Referring to Figure 2, the prior art typlcally providers a thrust chamber 10 comprising a cylindrical combustor 12, an injector 14 for injecting propellants at relatively low initial velocities about Mach .05 into combustor 12, and a deLaval nozzle 16 having a convergent portion OB which contracts the combusted propellants delivered by the combustor 12 to achieve sonic flow conditions at and about the nozzle throat plane 20 and a divergent portion 22 which then expands the flow to achieve supersonic exit velocities at nozzle exit plane 24.Since the flow conditions are choked at throat plane 20 throughout the useable operating range of thrust chamber 10, the nozzle expansion area ratio for thrust chamber 10 is fixed by the ratio of the area at nozzle exit plane 24 divided by the area at nozzle throat plane 20. The contour of deLaval nozzle 16 is governed by assumptions that combustion is essentlally complete at nozzle inlet plane 26 and that the axial rate of area change along the nozzle will proceed substantially according to the follow relationship EMI5.1 Thus, it can be seen that prior art thrust chamber 10 operates on the principle of according to the combustor 12 the sole function of containing the propellants as they undergo combustion and delegating to delaval nozzle 16 the functlon of accelerating the flow once the combustlon process has been completed. As a consequence, deLaval nozzle 16 must employ a convergent portion ia for accelerating the flow from a low sub sonic Mach number to a sonic condition indlcated by dotted line 41 while the total temperature To of the gases passing through nozzle 16 remains essentially constant. In contrast, the preferred embodiment of the present invention provide a thrust chamber 30 as shown in Figure 1 which comprises a divergent combustor 32 for containing combusting propellants and simultaneously accelerating the to sonic flow conditions, a throttleable injector 34 for injecting propellants into combustor 32 at a high initial velocity and for imparting to the injected propellants an initially rapid, axial rate of combustlon and a dlvergent nozzle 36 for further expanding the output of combustor 32. By reason of the divergence in walls 38 of combustor 32 and by reason of the high initial velocity and rapid burning rate imparted to the injected propellants by injector 34. the injected propellants are accelerated while undergolng combustion to achleve sonic flow conditions at locations 40, 42 and 44, depending upon the throttle settling of injector 34.Location 40 corresponds to a full throttle setting ofInjector 3Z, location 42 corresponds to an intermediate throttle setting and location 44 corresponds to the lowest throttle settling. for each throttle setting. the expansion ratlo delivered by the engine is determined by the ratio of the area at nozzle exist plane 46, which is fixed in the preferred embodiment. divided by the cross sectlonal area of coRbustor 32 at locations 40, 42 or 44 depending upon the throttle setting of injector 34. Stnce the subject cross sectional areas of combustor 32 become smaller as the throttle of injector 34 is cut back, thrust chamber 30 provides at full throttle a moderate expansion ratio approximately 8 in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 as would be desired for a first stage launch engine and provides at low throttle a high nozzle expansion ratio approximately 14.4 in the embodiment shown in Flgure 1 as would be desired for operation in space. Thrust chamber 30 therefore provides a variable nozzle expansion ratio despite its fixed geometry and does so by providing means for allowing the location of sonic flow conditions to be positioned variably within divergent combustor 32 according to throttle setting.Although the embodiment shown in Figure 1 can range in expansion from 8 to 14.4, other embodiments might be constructed to provide different ranges such as from 40 to 80. It to be understood that the dotted lines designated locations 40, 42 and 44 in Figure l are pictorial representations of where the injected propellants achieve sonic flow conditions within combustor 32. Consequently, the dotted lines bulge in the manner characterisic of sonic flow lines. It is also to be noted that. as injector 34 is throttled down, the sonic flow line becomes located closer and closer to injector 34 as is perceivable from the spatial arrangment of locations 40, 42 and 44.Only one sonic line exists at any given throttle setting. The ability of thrust chamber 30 to accelerate the combusting propellants to sonic flow conditions by the time they reach either location 40, 42 or 44 within combustor 32 is governed substantially by the following equatlon EMI7.1 As is suggested by the above equation, injector 34 is constructed such that it imparts an axial rate of combustion such that the dTo To term of equation 2 overcomes the negative of the dA A term so that the dM2 M2 term is positive. It is also to be noted that equatlon 2 reduces approximately to the following relationship EMI7.2 Thus for small Mach numbers,EMI7.3 and accordingly, the axial rate of combustion and temperature rate rise near combustor inlet plane 48 must proceed at a rate twice as great as the axial rate of area change resulting from the divergence of walls 38 of combustor 32.As the combusting propellants approach sonic flow conditions, the relationship becomes EMI8.1 Thus, in the case of the preferred embodiment wherein the divergence of walls 38 of combustor 32 are set at a half angle a of approximately 6.50 so that the term dAfA Is constant , the axial rate of combustion aust proceed vigorously at first and and then taper off as the combusting gasses approach transonic speeds. As will be explained in the description which follows, injector 34 incorporates certaln design features to deliver the above described burning schedule. By reason that thrust chamber 30 is constructed in accordance wlth the above constraints, at full throttle the combusting propellants obtaln Mach 1 at location 40 in combustor 32, whereupon the flow enters nozzle 36 to be further expanded to supersonic velocities. At an intermediate and low throttle setting, sonic flow conditions are achieved at locations 42 and 44 respectively, wherefrom the remainder of the combustor 32 beyond the respective location 42 and 44 and nozzle 36 serve to further expand the flow.Consequently, thrust chamber 32, as it is throttled down, will exhiolt an increasingly greater expanslon ratlo by reason of the reduced throat area corresponding to the cross sectional area of combustor 32 at locations 42 and 44 at the lower throttle settings. Ideally, the dtvergence of walls 38 and the output of injector 34 should be matched during the design phase of constructing such that the ratio of thrust to throat area ls held constant over the range of throttle settings, which matching causes the combustion pressure Pc to favorably remain constant over the operating range of the engine.By maintaining constant combustion pressure, gas kinetic losses and losses due to incomplete combustion can be minimized. This matching entalls providing an injector geometry design and throttling orifice structure which allows the burning rate to proceed to substantial completion by the time the combusting gases reach the sonic line position 40, 42 or 44. If the rate is too slow, the divergence of combustor 32 must be decreased or conversely, if the burning rate is too quick. the divergence must be increased Moreover, the stability of the sonic line positioning must be assured for a given throttle setting. Referring to Figure 1, walls 38 of combustor 32 are provided with a divergence of an average half angle a of approximately 6 1 20, but tn many applications it will range upwardly to 70 or more or downwardly to less than 50 depending upon the axial burning rate profile and pressure achieved by injector 34. In the alternative, walls 38 can follow a contour described by the polynomial form EMI9.1 where y is the radlal coordinate and X is the distance from the injector face toward the throat plane. An alternate exponentlal shape can be described by EMI9.2 or a more complex summative serles of exponential elements. Referring to Figures 3 and 4, injector 34 of the preferred embodiment follows established construction practices for rocket injectors in so far as it provides a plurallty of matched pairs of fuel orifices 52 and oxidizer orifices 54 disposed upon injector face 56, the fuel and oxidizer orifices belng organized into concentric rings, wlth the orifices of each ring leading from an internal fuel manifold 58 or an internal oxidizer manifold 60. These manifolds 58 and 60 are themselves ring shaped and concentrically disposed to one another in the preferred embodiment and are supplied by fuel duct 62 and oxidizer duct 64, respectively. Injector 34 is modified, however, over the usual design in order to achieve the desired flow rate, the desired axial rate of combustion and the desired initial gas velocity necessary to support the attainment of sonic flow conditions within combustor 32. These modtflcattons are presented by a comparison between the features of injector 14 of prior art thrust chamber 10 and those of injector 34, it being understood that thrust chamber 30 is designed to deliver the same max1our flow rate and thrust as thrust chamber 10. Because the cross sectional area at combustor inlet plane 48 is smaller than the area at locatlon 40, injector face 56 will be considerably smaller in cross section area than that of injector 14 employed in prior art thrust chamber 10. Accordingly, the pairs of fuel and oxidizer orifices 52 and 54 in injector 34 are about twicely more densely arrayed than in prior art injector 14 and are approximately twice as small in diameter orifices 52 and 54 of injector 34 are reduced in diameter from the more usual 30 to 60 thousandths of an inch to 10 to 15 thousandths in the preferred embodiment . The operatlng pressures of injector 34 are elevated above those of the prlor art by at least 100 per cent.This increased injector pressure drop can be provided by the extraction of additional boost from the turbopumps in the overall engine system or by other means well within the cognizance of those versed in the art of rocket engine systems. Injector 34 is further modified to provide an angle of impingement e between paired fuel and oxidizer orifices 52 and 54 of approximately 900, which, in conjunction with the increased operatlng pressures, causes the emitted small Jetlets of fuel and oxidizes 66 and 68 to form a gaseous plume 70 of combusting gases having a very rapid initial burning rate and a high initial velocity approximately Mach 0.15 to Mach 0.20 as compared to an initial velocity of Mach 0.05 commonly found in the prlor art . Prior art injector 14 commonly employs an angle of incidence of approximately 600.By reason of this high initial velocity and Initially rapid burning rate, and because of the diminutive size of injector 34 in comparlson to the large flow rates passing therethrough, walls 38 actually constrict the combusting gases belng ejected from injector 34 and rapidly accelerates the. to sonic flow conditions. Referring to Figure 4, injector 34 is made throttleable by external valving elements 72 and 74 which control the flow rates into fuel duct 62 and oxidizer duct 64 respectively, in accordance with practice well known to the art. Referrlng now also to the dotted portion of Figure 4, throttling can also be achieved through use of an aeration system wherein inert gas is introduced into fuel and oxldlzer ducts 62 and 64 through inert gas control valvlng elements 76 and 78 as the flows of fuel and oxidizes are throttled by valves 72 and 74, respectlvely. The inert gas can be supplied by the same source as that used to pressurize the propellant tanks of the engine system or from one or both of the propellants heated to a gaseous form in the coollng jacket. In Figure 5 there is shown another embodiment of injector 34 wherein throttllng is achleved by pintle valves 80 and 82 whose axial movements are effected by external cams not shown for the purpose of opening and cEoslWg OZrrtEes 52 and 54, respectively. In Figure 6 there is shown another emobodiment of injector 34 whereln coaxial, momentum exchanger injector elements 84 are employed.Because coaxial injector elements 84 are considerably smaller than those commonly employed in the prior art, and because tip 86 of the oxidizer orifice 54 is recessed further back than usual, injector element 86 initiates rapid combustion close to injector face 56 as is desired for the practice of the present invention. As previously discussed, injector 34 is smaller than injector 14 of the prtor art compare Figures 1 and 2 and yet injector 34 will usually be required to provide the same maximum flow rate. Consequently, injector 34 has smaller, more numerous and more densely arranged injector elements than prior art injector 14. They also operate at a higher pressure.However, it is to be realized that these differences work favorably towards the practice of the present invention because the increases inboth the operating pressures and numbers of the injector elements and the decreases in their size and spacing promote rapid initial combustion and favor high initial velocities tn the propellants. For purposes of comparison, Table 1 provides the approximate dimensions of parlor art thrust chamber 10 as it would correspond to anAtlas B 3 booster thrust chamber and the approximate dimensions of thrust chamber 30 constructed according to the present invention and providing the same maximum thrust and flow rate as thrust chamber 10.Figures 1 and 2 indicate the respective points of measurement for the following terms Lc length of combustor On length of nozzle De nozzle dlameter at its exit plane Dt nozzle diameter at the nozzle throat for thrust chamber 10 and the diameter at the exit of combustor 3 2 for thrust chamber 30 , D1 diameter at the combustor inlet , and c the expansion ratio of the thrust chamber .

Thins advantage ts in addiction to the advantage that thrust chamber 30 provides a varlable nozzle expansion ratio so that at launch it can deliver full thrust with maximum propellant flow rate at a moderate expansion ratio and in space can deliver reduced thrust at a moderate propellant flow rate at an efficient, high expansion ratio. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. In particular, thrust chamber 30 might be dimensioned differently from the preferred embodiment to thereby achieve a different range of expanslon ratios. Additionally, alternate means for throttllng injector 34 might be employed as well as other means for achieving a rapid burning rate. It is therefore to be understood that, swithin the scope of the appended clalms, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically descrlbed.
