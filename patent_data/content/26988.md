# A resilient material, a process for the preparation of a resilient material, and articles of the said material.

## Abstract
The invention provides a resilient material comprising the reaction product of a hydrolysed starch polyacrylonitrile graft copolymer and a sugar alcohol. The invention further provides a process for the prepara tion of a resilient material as described above, which material is useful for the manufacture of seat pads, artificial limb pads, toys and other applications where resilient, soft, shock absor bent materials find utility.
