# APPARATUS FOR DISK MEMORY

## Abstract
A magnetic disk memory seats a memory disk with a consistent high accuracy by engagement on only one side of the disk with a drive chuck 18 that imparts both a circumferential disk rotating force and a radial disk locating force. The two forces firmly seat an angled pair of precision disk faces 76, 78 onto the drive spindle 44 . The memory disk further can attach at only an inner periphery to the disk hub, by means of a selectively compliant adhesive tape, to allow the disk to deflect elastically away from the hub for accurate head penetration at inner recording tracks. The drive spindle has an arcuate, partial circumferential portion 100 , defining substantially less than a full circum ferential portion, that engages the angled pair of precision disk faces 76, 78 .
