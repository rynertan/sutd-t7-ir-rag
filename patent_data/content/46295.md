## Abstract
A novel ink printing apparatus utilizes electro osmotic force on a face of dielectric substance substrate 10 between a needle shaped recording electrode 20 and a ring shaped auxiliary electrode 30. When a voltage of a suitable polarity is applied between the electrodes 20 and 30, a fluid ink of solvent ink 40 laid on the di electric substrate 10 to range from the electrodes 30 to 20 travels by the electroosmotic force and makes pro trusion 41 on the end tip 20 of the recording electrode 20. By applying a high voltage between a counter elec trode 60 behind a recording paper 50 and the recording electrode 20, the fluid ink 41 flies to the recording paper.
