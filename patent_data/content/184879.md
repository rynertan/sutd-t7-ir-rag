# Projection lens system.

## Abstract
A lens system is provided which is suitable for back projecting an enlarged image of a TV cathode ray tube CRT . To achieve a compact cabinet design for such a projection tele vision set, a short projection throw and a wide projection angle are required, together with a wide aperture F 1 for a bright projected picture and with a definition which may need to be good enough to resolve 1249 line television pictures. The lens system comprises a concave CRT face plate FP and three lens elements L1, L2, L3. L2 and L3 are each of positive power and L1, most remote from the CRT, is a weak lens. At least one of the element surfaces is aspheric. The powers of the elements are chosen so that 0.20K K₁ 0.15K 0.62K K₂ 0.80K and 0.55K K₃ 0.67K where K₁ is the power of the first weak element remote from the object surface, K₂ is the power of the second element, K₃ is the power of the third element adjacent to the CRT surface and K is the total power of the projection lens. Projection angles upto 40 degrees are obtained.
