## Description
Antiviral compositions and a method.for treating virus diseases The present invention relates to antiviral compositions and, more particularly, to antiviral compositions which contain aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid derivatives or salts thereof which are effective for therapeutic treatment of various infectious diseases which are caused from viruses, for example, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, Bronchitis and so on. The present invention further relates to a method of treating virus diseases by said compositions. Vaccines which have been used for viral diseases are slow acting and their utility is limited only to preventive use.Moreover, since antigenicity of objective viruses often changes, the effect of vaccines have not been sufficient Under these circumstances, the present inventors have carried out intensive studies to find out rharmaceuticals which have fast acting therapeutic effects. As a result, the inventors found out that aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid derivatives meet the above requirement, thus completed the present invention Accordingly7the object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions having antiviraL activity which contain aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid derivatives which are effective for therapeutic treatment of various infectious diseases caused from viruses, such as upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, Bronchitis and so on. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating virus diseases by said compositions Further objects and advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent during the course of the description with follows. The present invention relates to antiviral compositions which contain as an active component aminosulfonylhalogenobenaoic acid derivatives of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein X and Y, independently of each other, denote hydrogen atom, fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom, amino group or nitro group, R1 denotes hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group,R2 denotes hydrogen atom, amino group, lower alkyl group, hydroxyalkyl group, lower alkoxy group, aryl group, guanyl. group, guanidino group, ureido group, oxamoylamino group or chloro substituted pyridazinoamino group, or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom in the formula may form a saturated heterocyclic group having 4 or 5 carbon atoms in which the carbon atoms may be substituted by an oxygen atom or nonsubstituted or lower alkyl substituted nitrogen atom and R3 denotes hydrogen atom, cyclohexyl group, benzyl group, aryl group, or straight or branched alkyl group which consists of 1 to 12 carbon atoms provided that 3 aminosulfonyl 4halogenobenzoic acid is excluded from the formula I and the salts thereof. The compounds which are the main ingredients of antiviral compositions according to the present invention can be prepared as follows. Namely, ha logenobenzoic acid is heated in chlorosulfonic acid to obtain chlorosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid, Brit. 8961,137 Chlorosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid thus obtained is reacted with an amino the formula II EMI3.1 room temperature in a solvent such as water, dioxane, THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, benzen and so on or in a mixed solvent of water with one of these organic solvents, in the presence of deoxidizing agent, for example, inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and so on or an organic base such as triethyl amine, pyridine and so on, or usingEMI3.2 per se as deoxydizing agent. Aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic ester can be prepared as follows HalogenoaminosulfonyIbenzoic acid is heated in chlorothionyl to obtain halogenoaminosulfonyl benzoic chloride GB PS No. 915,259 . Halogenoaminosulfonylbenzoic chloride obtained in this way is reacted with an alcohol of the following formula III R4OH III wherein R4 has the same meaning as R3 excluding hydrogen atom.The reaction is performed at room temperature or under heating when necessary in a solvent such as dioxane, tetr ahydrofuran, chloroform, dichloromethane, and benzene.Alternatively, the alcohol showing the above formula III per se is used as a solvent.

SEP SEP 1,000 tb SEP 41 SEP 3,000 SEP 1,000 tb SEP 42 SEP 3,000 SEP 1,000 tb As apparent from the above experimental examples, all of the compounds 1 42 have antiviral activity of wide spectrum and are of extremely high safety. Therefore, they have very high clinical utility for treating various infectious diseases which are caused from virus infection, for example, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, Brouchitis and so on. In case that the compounds of the present invention are administerd to a human body, dosage fpr an adult is 30 5,000 mg per day for the compounds 1 6, 8 12, 14 18, 25 28, 31 33, 41, and 42 10 5,000 mg per day for teh compounds 7, 13, 19, 20, 30,.35, and 37 50 5,000 mg per day for the compounds 21 24, 29, 34, 36, 38, 39, and 41. However, the dosage may be increased or decreased out of the above range according to symptoms, ages, and other conditions. The compounds 1 42 can be formulated as pharmaceutical preparations by conventional method with pharmaceutical carriers, base materials as excipients commonly used for this purpose. Example of solid carriers and.excipients usable advantageously herein include common excipients such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch and pota to starch inders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, arabic gum, corn starch and gelatin disintegrators such as corn starch, potato starch and calcium carbohydroxymethylcellulose and lubricants such as talc and magnesium stearate Examples of liquid carriers usable advantageously herein include distilled water for injection, physiological saline solution, vegetable oils for injection and glycols such as propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol.Such preparations can be for example capsules, tablets, powders or orai liquid preparations including dry sirups for oral application rectum suppository for intrarectal application for injection, they can be for example, freeze dried preparations which can be dissolved in distilled water for injection .immediately before administration and other preparatlons such.. as nose drops or inhalant can also be adopted, The following are the examples of pharmaceutical.prepara tions, but such preparations should not be limited only to the illustrated ones Example 1 Tablets Ingredients Amounts I Compound 7 50 g II Lactose proper amount III Crystalline cellulose 60 g IV Potato starch 54 g V Magnesium stearate 2 g 200 g The ingredients I IV were homogeneously mixed and 10 paste from the part of the ingredient IV which had been previously separated was added to the above mixture to prepare granules, and then the granules were dried. Next, the granules were mixed with the ingredient V to provide tablets each weighing 200 mg. If desired, the tablets may be coated with sugar in usual manner.Example 2 10t Powders Ingredients Amounts Compound 35 100 g Lactose 890 g Magnesium stearate 10 g 1000 g After each of the above ingredients was weighted, the ingredients were homogeneously mixed to prepare 5 powders. Example 3 Capsules Ingredients Amounts I Compound 23 50 g II Calcium hydrogenphosphate 50 g III Aluminum silicate proper amount IV Crystalline cellulose 60 g V Magnesium stearate 2 g 200 g The above ingredients I V were put together and mixed well through a sieve, to give capsul es each weighing 200 mg were prepared from the mixture in usual manner Example 4 Injectable solutions One hundred grams of sodium salt of the Compound 2 were dissolved in 2 Z of distilled water for injection and from this solution, injectable solutions which contain 100 mg of the active compound in 2 mQ of the solution per ampoule were prepared in usual manner. Example 5 1 Nose drops Ingredients Amounts Compound 2 sodium salt 10 g Sodium chloride 5 g Chlorobutanol 5 g Distilled water added to become 1,000 mQ After each of the above ingredients was weighed and dissolved together in 950 ml of water, the solution was filled up to become 1,000 mQ to prepare 1 nose drops,
