# THERMAL TYPE OVERLOAD RELAY

## Abstract
In a thermal type overload relay a bimetallic strip 3 deforms due to heat produced by an excessive amount of current to actuate a normally closed movable contact 16 which constitutes normally closed contact 16, 18 , and an operating rod 21 is moved in a predetermined direction to thereby close a normally open contact comprising a nor mally open fixed contact 24 and a normally open movable contact 25 . A reset rod 26 is movable in the direction per pendicular to the operating rod 21 so that when the reset rod 26 is moved in direction perpendicular to the operating rod 21 , the normally open fixed contact 24 is caused to move toward the normally open movable contact 25 , whereby the normally open contact 24, 25 is returned to the original position, and the normally closed contact 16, 18 is also returned to the original position by a returning movement of the normally closed movable contact 16 due to the returning movement of the operating rod 21 .
