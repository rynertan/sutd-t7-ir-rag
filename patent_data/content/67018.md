# Material working machines.

## Abstract
In a material working e.g. penetrating, loading, compact ing machine the power and machine weight needed to achieve a given performance can be reduced by making one 50 of two pivots 34, 50 at which a working implement such as a bucket 14 is supported an eccentric pivot and driving it by means of a motor 36 . The circular vibration of the bucket at pivot 50 combined with arcuate vibration which results and is permitted at pivot 34 by means of link 30 , causes the work ing portion, namely bucket teeth 56 , to vibrate on a closed elongate curved path 58. This improves penetration and load ing performance of the bucket without requiring excessive power to generate the vibrations.
