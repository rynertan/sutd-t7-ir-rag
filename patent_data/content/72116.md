# Automatic slack adjuster.

## Abstract
A single acting, clearance sensing slack adjuster for brakes is provided. The slack adjuster includes a displaceable brake actuation means 18 , a rotatable driving member 74 , and a rotatable driven member 82 . A normally engaged posi tive clutch 64 66 provides a driving connection between the driven member and a rotatable adjustment member 50 . The rotatable adjustment member is rotatable in a given direction to advance the brake friction member 32 to maintain the run ning clearance 38 within predetermined limits. The driving member is rotatable in the slack decreasing direction of rota tion thereof in response to greater than predetermined move ment of the brake actuation means. A force limiting coil clutch 80 couples the driving member to the driven member. Force limiting coil clutch 80 delivers torque in the given direction with a torque capacity which is less than is required to rotate the rotatable actuation members when the brake friction mem bers are engaged but is greater than the torque required to ro tate the rotatable actuation members when the brake friction members are not engaged. A fitting 104 accessible from the exterior of the housing 12 is provided for selectively disen gaging the normally engaged positive clutch and for applying a rotational force to the rotatable adjustment member for manu al adjustment of the brake slack.
