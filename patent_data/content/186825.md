# Copolyestercarbonate composition.

## Abstract
Copolyester carbonate composition exhibiting im proved resistance to organic solvents comprising, in admix ture i at least one aromatic copolyester carbonate resin ii at least one aromatic polycarbonate resin iii at least one selectively hydrogenated block copoly mer of a vinyl aromatic compound and an olefinic elas tomer and iv at least one polymer selected from an olefin acry late copolymer, an olefin diene terpolymer, or mixtures thereof. The instant composition also exhibits improved impact properties and relatively high heat resistance.
