# Process of hot isostatic pressing of ferrite material workpieces.

## Abstract
Process of hot isostatic pressing of MnZn ferrite material for producing ferrite close to theoretical density without a significant increase in grain size. Permeability is increased with the increase in theoretical density. The process includes the steps of pressurizing an entire ferrite sample which is surrounded by pieces of similar composition while in alumina crucibles with fused alumina grain there between and an optional oxygen getter on top of the grain, introduc ing an inert atmosphere, elevating pressure and tempera ture, the temperature elevated to a value below that previously used for sintering or hot pressing, and maintain ing temperature to optimize density without excess grain growth. Density is thereby optimized without excess grain growth, while maintaining or improving the magnetic prop erties.
