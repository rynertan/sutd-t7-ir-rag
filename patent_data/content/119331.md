## Description
TRANSPARENT MATERIAL HAVING ANTIREFLECTIVE COATING BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an antireflective coating which can easily be formed and which is excellent in durability, heat resistance and impact resistance and has a good dyestuff permeability, and also to a transparent material excellent in the antireflective property, which has this antireflective coating on the surface thereof. 2 Description of the Prior Art When a thing is viewed through a transparent material, if reflected light is intense and a reflected image is clear, the observation is annoying. For example, in case of an eyeglass lens, a reflected image called a ghost or flare is formed and gives an unpleasant feeling to the eyes. Moreover, in case of a looking glass or the like, the object is blurred by reflected light on the glass surface. As means for preventing reflection, there has heretofore been adopted a method in which a coating of a material having a refractive index different from that of a substrate is formed on the substrate by vacuum evaporation deposition or the like. It is known that in order to enhance the reflection preventive effect in this method, selection of the film thickness of the material covering the substrate is very important. For example, it is known that in case of a monolayer coating film, if the optical thickness of the substance having a lower refractive index than that of the substrate is adjusted to 1 4 of the wavelength of the objective ray or an odd number of times thereof, a minimum reflectance, that is, a maximum transmittance, is obtained.By the term optical thickness used herein is meant the product of the refractive index of the coating film forming material and the thickness of the coating film. Furthermore, formation of a multilayer antireflective coating is also known, and several proposals have been made in connection with selection of the thickness see Optics of Thin Films , pages 159 283, A. Vasicek North Holland Publishing Company , Amsterdam 1960 J. These antireflective coating rilms formed by vacuum evaporation deposition involve the following problems in some application fields 1 Since a high degree of vacuum is necessary, the size and material of the substrate are restricted.Moreover, the manufacturing time is prolonged, resulting in reduction of the productivity and increase of the manufacturing cost. 2 Heating to a considerable extent is ordinarily necessary, and in some substrates, deformation or degradation is caused. 3 The coating film forming material used is in principle an inorganic oxide. Although an inorganic oxide gives a compact and dense film, if a plastic material is used as the substrate, reduction of the heat resistance and adhesion is caused owing to the difference in the coefficient of linear expansion between the coating film and the substrate. 4 A dyestuff permeability, which is necessary for dyeing as effective means for coloring the transparent substrate, is completely lost. 5 Also in a glass covered with a dyeable material, loss of the dyeability and reduction of the heat resistance and adhesion are similarly caused. As means for rendering the surface of an optical element substantially non reflecting without adopting the vacuum evaporation deposition technique, there can be mentioned a method in which a coating having fine particles is formed see U.S. Patent No. 2,536,764 and a method in which an optical element of polymeric material is provided with a microstructured surface see U.S. Patent No. 4,114,983 .In these methods, reflected light is scattered to render the reflected image dim. However, also the light transmitted through the transparent material is scattered, and therefore, the effect of improving the transmittance while reducing the reflectance, as attained in the above mentioned coating film obtained by vacuum evaporation deposition, cannot be attained. Furthermore, there is known a method in which a silicon coating is formed on a plastic substrate and then subjected to plasma polymerization to attain an antireflective effect see U.S. Patent No. 4,137,365 However, the dyestuff permeability is lost and since the coating film is formed from the gas phase, as in the vacuum evaporation deposition method, the productivity is low and the production cost is high. We previously proposed an antireflective coating film having a dyestuff permeability, which is formed by treating an organic film containing inorganic fine particles with an activating gas see U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. 205,346 . This coating film, however, is insufficient in heat resistance and water resistance at high temperatures. Moreover, there is known an antireflective coating film for a solar cell, formed by the liquid two layer coating method in which TiO2 SiO2 forming compounds are used for the first layer and Si02 forming compounds are used for the second layer see Applied Optics, Vol. 18, No. 18, pages 3133 3138 . This antireflective coating film, like the coating film formed by the vacuum evaporation deposition method, has no dyestuff permeability, and this antireflective coating film is readily cracked or broken by thermal or mechanical deformation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an antireflective coating having a dyestuff permeability, which is excellent in durability, heat resistance and impact resistance. Another object of the present invention is to provide a dyeable transparent material which has an antireflective coating excellent in durability, heat resistance and impact resistance. More specifically, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a transparent material having an antireflective coating comprising at least two layers, which is formed at least on a part of the surface of a substrate, wherein the thickness and refractive index of the layer layer I contiguous to the substrate and the thickness and refractive index of the outermost layer layer 0 satisfy the following requirements EMI4.1 wherein nI represents the refractive index of the layer contiguous to the substrate, nO represents the refractive index of the outermost layer, dI represents the film thickness in nm of the layer contiguous to the substrate, do represents the film thickness in nm of the outermost layer, Q is a positive integer, m is an odd positive integer and X stands for an optional standard wavelength in nm selected within the visible ray wavelength region or in the vicinity thereof, and n1 I and n1 n5 wherein nS represents the refractive index of the substrate, the composition for forming the layer contiguous to the substrate is a composition comprising at least one member selected from the group consisting of alkoxides and acylates of titanium, aluminum and zirconium having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms, chelate compounds of said metals and dispersed phases in liquid of oxides of said metals, in an amount of at least 10 by weight as the metal oxide equivalent weight, based on the weight of the coating layer forming components, and the composition for forming the outermost layer is a composition comprising at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an organic silicon compound represented by the following general formula RÚaRêbSi OR 4 a b wherein RÚ and Rê independently stand for a hydro carbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, which contains an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, halogeno, epoxy, amino, mercapto, methacryloxy or cyano group, R stands for an alkyl, alkoxyalkyl or acyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, a and b are 0 or 1, and the sum of a and b is 1 or 2, and a hydrolyzed product of said organic silicon compound in an amount of at least 20 by weight as the solid content equivalent weight and based on the weight of the coating layer forming components. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a graph showing the reflective photospectrum of an antireflective lens exhibiting a yellowish green reflected light color according to one embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a graph showing the reflective photospectrum of an antireflective lens having a magenta reflected light color according to another embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The transparent substrate used in the present invention is a substrate having such a transparency that the haze value represented by the following formula is not more than 80 Haze value percent diffUsed light transmittance luminous transmittance x 100 This transparent substrate may be colored or color patterned according to need or may be covered with a coating giving a scratch resistance, so far as the haze value determined according to the above formula is not more than 80 . In order to attain the intended effects of the present invention, that is, the effects of reducing the luminous reflectance and enhancing the luminous transmittance, it is preferred that the transparency of the substrate be as high as possible. A substrate in which reduction of the luminous reflectance is sufficient only on one surface and the opposite surface is covered with an opaque material may also be used as the transparent substrate in the present invention. In this case, the haze value should be defined as that of the substrate from which the opaque material on the opposite surface is removed. Molded articles, sheets and films of glass and plastic materials can be mentioned as the transparent substrate.When a plastic article is used as the substrate, a coating material may be applied to the substrate for improving or imparting such properties as adhesion, hardness, chemical resistance, durability and dyeability. However, the substrate covered with this coating material should have the above mentioned transparency, that is, a haze value of not more than 80 . In the present invention, liquid compositions are applied to the transparent substrate to form a multilayer antireflective coating thereon. In these liquid compositions, it is not indispensable that all the components be liquid. For example, some components are dispersed as particulate solid substances to give a heterogeneous composition, so far as the composition as a whole can be treated as a liquid in the coating operation. From the viewpoint of the antireflective effect and surface protecting effect, it is indispensable that the liquid compositions comprise components described below. The composition for forming the layer contiguous to the substrate should be a composition comprising at least one member selected from alkoxides and acylates of titanium, aluminum and zirconium having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms, chelate compounds of said metals and dispersions in liquid of oxides of said metals in an at least amount, as the metal oxide equivalent weight, of l0 by weight based on the weight of a coating forming component.As examples of the metal compound, there can be mentioned metal alkoxides such as titanium tetraethoxide, titanium tetra i propoxide, titanium tetra n propoxide, titanium tetra n butoxide, titanium tetra sec butoxide, titanium tetra tert butoxide, tetrakis 2 ethylhexoxy titanium, aluminum triethoxide, aluminum tri i propoxide, aluminum tributoxide, zirconium tetraethoxide, zirconium tetra i propoxide, zirconium tetra n propoxide, zirconium tetra n butoxide, zirconium tetra sec butoxide and zirconium tetra tert butoxide metal acylates such as titanium dibutoxide diacetate and titanium dibutoxide dipropionate chelate compounds such as di isopropoxytitanium bisacetylacetonate, dibutoxytitanium bisacetylacetonate, diethoxytitanium bisacetylacetonate, zirconium tetrakisacetylacetonate, zirconium monobutoxytrisacetylacetonate, zirconium dibutoxybisacetylacetonate, zirconium tributoxyacetylacetonate, aluminum acetylacetonate, aluminum di n butoxide monoethylacetoacetate, aluminum di i propoxide monomethylacetoacetate, tri n butoxide zirconium monoethylacetoacetate, n butoxide zirconium trisethylacetonate and di n butoxide bisethylacetonate and oligomers and polymers obtained by condensation of hydrolysate of the above mentioned alkoxides.Furthermore, dispersions in liquid, especially in water or alcohol, of fine particles of oxides of titanium, aluminum and zirconium may be used. Based on the supposition that the above mentioned metal compound is converted to TiO2 x , Al 0 or ZrO which 23y 2z x, y and z are positive integers in the formed coating, the amount of this metal compound is expressed as the metal oxide equivalent weight. It is indispensable that the above mentioned metal compound be contained in an amount, as the metal oxide equivalent weight, of at least 10 by weight based on the weight of the coating layer forming components.If the amount of the metal compound is smaller than 10 by weight, the antireflective effect is undesirably low. The composition for forming the outermost layer should be a composition comprising at least one compound selected from organic silicon compounds represented by the following general formula RÚaRêbSi OR 4 a b and hydrolyzed products of said organic silicon compounds in an amount, as the solid content equivalent weight, of at least 20 by weight based on the weight of coating layer forming components. In the above general formula, RÚ and Rê stand for a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, which contains an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, halogeno, epoxy, amino, mercapto, methacryloxy or cyano group, R stands for an alkyl, alkoxyalkyl or acyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, a and b are 0 or 1, and the sum of a and b is 1 or 2. As examples of the above mentioned organic silicon compound, there can be mentioned trialkoxy , triacyloxy and triphenoxy silanes such as methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxyethoxysilane, methyltriacetoxysilane, methyltributoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxyethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane, phenyl triethoxysilane, phenyl tri acetoxysilane, y chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, y chloropropyltriethoxysilane, y chloropropyltriacetoxysilane, 3,3 ,3 trifluoropropyltrimethoxysilane, y methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, y aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, y aminopropyltriethoxysilane, y mercaptopropyltrimethoxy silane, y mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, N B aminoethyl Y aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, a cyanoethyltriethoxysilane, methyltriphenoxysilane, chloromethyltrimethoxysilane, chloromethyltriethoxysilane, glycidoxymethyltrimethoxysilane, glycidoxymethyltriethoxysilane, a glycidoxyethyltrimethoxysilane, a glycidoxyethyltriethoxysilane, ss glyci oxyethyltri methoxysilane, B glycidoxyethyltriethoxysilane, a glycidoxy propyltrimethoxysilane, a glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane, a glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, a glycidoxypropyltri ethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, y glycidoxy propyltriethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropyltripropoxysilane, y glycidoxypropyltributoxysilane, y glycidoxypropyltri methoxyethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropyltriphenoxysilane, a glycidoxybutyltrimethoxysilane, a glycidoxybutyltriethoxysilane, B glycidoxybutyltrimethoxysilane, B glycidoxybutyl triethoxysilane, y glycidoxybutyltrimethoxysilane, y glycidoxybutyltriethoxysilane, 6 glycidoxybutyltrimethoxy silane, 6 glycidoxybutyltriethoxysilane, 3,4 epoxycyclo hexyl methyltrimethoxysilane, 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl methyltri ethoxysilane, a 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane, a 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltriethoxysilane, B 3,4 epoxy cyclohexyl ethyltripropoxysilane, a 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltributoxysilane, a 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxy ethoxysilane, ss 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltriphenoxysilane, y 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl propyltrimethoxysilane, y 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl propyltriethoxysilane, 6 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl butyltrimethoxysilane and 6 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl butyltri ethoxysilane and dialkoxysilanes and diacyloxysilanes such as dimethyldimethoxysilane, phenylmethyldimethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, phenylmethyldiethoxysilane, y chloro propylmethyldimethoxysilane, y chloropropylmethyldiethoxy silane, dimethyldiacetoxys ilane , y methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, y methacryloxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, y mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, y mercaptopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, Y aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, y aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, methylvinyldimethoxy silane, methylvinyldiethoxysilane, glycidoxymethylmethyldimethoxysilane, glycidoxymethylmethyldiethoxysilane, a glycidoxyethylmethyldimethoxysilane, a glycidoxyethyl methyldiethoxysilane, B glycidoxyethylmethyldimethoxysilane, ss glycidoxyethylmethyldiethoxysilane, a glycidoxypropyl methyldimethoxysilane, a glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, ss glycidoxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, Fglycidoxypropyl methyldiethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropyl methyldipropoxysilane, Y glycidoxypropylmethyldibutoxysilane, Y glycidoxypropylmethyldimethoxyethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropylmethyldiphenoxysilane, Y glycidoxypropylethyldimethoxy silane, Y glycidoxypropylethyldiethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropylvinyldimethoxysilane, y glycidoxypropylvinyldiethoxy silane, y glycidoxypropylphenyldimethoxysilane and y glycidoxypropylphenyldiethoxysilane. These organic silicon compounds may be used either alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more of them. In order to impart the dyeability, use of epoxy groupcontaining organic silicon compounds is especially preferred. In order to lower the curing temperature and promote the hardening, it is preferred that these organic silicon compounds be used after they are hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis can be accomplished by adding pure water or an aqueous acid solution such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or sulfuric acid to the organic silicon compound and stirring the mixture. The degree of hydrolysis can easily be controlled by adjusting the amount of pure water or the aqueous acid solution used. In view of promotion of the hydrolysis, it is especially preferred that 1 to 3 moles, per mole of the alkoxy group, of pure water or the aqueous acid solution be added for the hydrolysis. Since an alcohol or the like is produced upon hydrolysis, the hydrolysis can be carried out in the absence of a solvent. However, in order to perform the hydrolysis uniformly, there may be adopted a method in which the organic silicon compound is mixed with a solvent and the hydrolysis is then carried out. Furthermore, for a certain purpose, the hydrolyzed product may be used after an appropriate amount of the alcohol or the like produced by the hydrolysis is removed by heating and or under reduced pressure. Moreover, in order to promote the hydrolysis reaction and advance the pre condensation, the reaction mixture may be heated at a temperature higher than room temperature. Needless to say, in order to control the pre condensation, the hydrolysis reaction may be carried out at a temperature of not higher than room temperature. It is indispensable that the organic silicon compound or the hydrolyzed product thereof be contained in an amount, as the solid content equivalent weight, of at least 20 by weight based on the weight of the coating layer forming components. The solid content equivalent weight referred to herein means the amount equivalent to the formula weight, corresponding to R1aR2bSiO 4 a b of the organic silicon compound represented by the general formula R1 aR2bSI OR 4 a b For example, in case of methyltrimethoxysilane CH3Si OCH3 3 molecular weight 136 , the solid content equivalent weight of 1 g of this compound is the amount corresponding toCH3Si03 2 formula weight 67 , that is, 0.493 g 67 136 . If the solid content equivalent weight of the organic silicon compound or the hydrolyzed product thereof is smaller than 20 by weight, such properties as surface hardness, flexibility and durability are degraded. In order to obtain a coating which can be practically acceptable in such properties as refractive index, hardness, durability, dyeability, water resistance, smoothness and adaptability to the coating operation, various components may be added to the respective coating compositions for forming an antireflective coating in addition to the above mentioned indispensable components. As the coating layer forming component, there may preferably be used various organic resins and aqueous or organic solvent dispersions of various inorganic fine particles, especially, silica called colloidal silica , which has an average particle diameter of 5 to 100 nm surface treated silica and coated silica are included . As the organic resin to be suitably employed for formation of a coating layer having a relatively high refractive index, there are preferably used resin compositions having a relatively high refractive index, such as compositions comprising polystyrene, a polystyrene copolymer, a polycarbonate, a polymer having an aromatic ring group other than polystyrene, a polymer having a heterocyclic or alicyclic group or a polymer containing a halogen other than fluorine, thermosetting resin forming compositions comprising a melamine resin, a phenolic resin or an epoxy resin as a curing agent, urethane forming compositions comprising an alicyclic or aromatic isocyanate and or a polyol, and compositions comprising a modified resin or prepolymer rendered radical curable by introducing a double bond into a compound as described above. As the organic resin to be suitably employed for formation of a coating layer having a relatively low refractive index, for example, an outermost layer, there are preferably used resin compositions having a relatively low refractive index, such as compositions comprising an aromatic ring free vinyl copolymer inclusive of an acrylic copolymer, a fluorine substitute polymer, an aromatic ring free polyester, a cellulose derivative, a silicone polymer or a hydrocarbon polymer, compositions comprising a prepolymer of a polymer as mentioned above, compositions comprising a curable functional groupcontaining polymer selected among the foregoing polymers and a curing agent, and compositions comprising a modified resin or prepolymer rendered radical curable by introducing a double bond into a compound as described above. Moreover, tetraalkoxysilanes such as methyl silicate, ethyl silicate, n propyl silicate, i propyl silicate, n butyl silicate, sec butyl silicate and t butyl silicate, and hydrolyzed products thereof may preferably be used.If a tetraalkoxysilane or a hydrolyzed product thereof is incorporated into the outermost layer, an antistatic effect can be given to the antireflective coating. Various additives, for example, a leveling agent and a defoamer for improving the adaptability to the coating operation, an ultraviolet absorber and an antioxidant as the coating modifier, and a surfactant for giving an antifogging property and an antistatic property may be added to the liquid coating compositions. In the coating operation, the compositions are ordinarily coated in the state diluted with a volatile solvent.The kind of the solvent is not particularly critical, but an appropriate solvent should be selected while the stability of the compositions, the wetting property to the transparent substrate and the volatility are taken into consideration.The solvent may be used either alone or as a mixture of two or more solvents. Certain solvents are effective for stabilizing the liquid coating compositions. For example, an alcohol having up to 8 carbon atoms, a monoalkyl ether or ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol, a diketone such as acetylacetone, an organic acid such as acetic acid and a keto ester such as ethyl acetoacetate are especially effective for stabilizing alkoxides and chelate compounds of titanium, zirconium and aluminum. By the term liquid coating composition used herein is meant a composition having a viscosity ordinarily applicable to the coating operation, and this liquid coating composition has a viscosity of not more than 10 poises, preferably not more than 1 poise, at the application temperature. In case of a liquid composition having too high a viscosity, it is difficult to obtain a uniform coating. Customary coating methods may be adopted, but in order to control the film thickness of the coating layer, curtain flow coating, dip coating, roller coating and spin coating methods are preferably adopted. In order to attain the objects of the present invention, any transparent material may be used as the transparent substrate, but in view of the fact that liquid compositions are coated, glass and plastic materials are especially preferred. As the plastic material, there are preferably used polymethyl methacrylate, a copolymer thereof, a polycarbonate, a diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate polymer CR 39 , a polyester, particularly polyethylene terephthalate, an unsaturated polyester, an acrylonitrile styrene copolymer, a vinyl chloride polymer resin, a polyurethane and an epoxy resin. Glass substrates may also advantageously be used. Moreover, a substrate of a plastic material as mentioned above or a glass substrate, which is covered with a coating material, can also preferably be used. Such properties as adhesion, hardness, chemical resistance, durability and dyeability can be improved by the coating material of the undercoat layer beneath the antireflective coating of the present invention. Various materials known to provide surface hardened coating films of plastics may be used for improving the hardness see, for example, U.S. Patents No. 3,894,881 and No. 4,211,823 .A dyeable, highly hardened coating film disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 4,211,823 is especially preferably applied to the antireflective multilayer coating of the present invention because the object of obtaining an abntireflective coating having a dyestuff permeability, can effectively attained. Various combinations of the substrate or coated substrate and the antireflective multilayer coating may be considered for attaining the objects of the present invention, and optimum combinations can be experimentally determined according to intended applications. The above mentioned liquid coating compositions are coated on a transparent substrate as described above. The coated compositions for the respective layers may be heat cured and or dried stepwise. Furthermore, there may be adopted a method in which a coating film of the first layer is pre cured and or dried and a second layer is then coated and cured. In case of a three layer antireflective coating, there may be adopted a method in which first and second layers are independently pre cured and or dried and a third layer is then coated and heat cured and or dried. Heating may be accomplished by hot air or infrared rays. The heating temperature should be decided according to the transparent substrate to be coated and the coating composition to be used, but the heating temperature is ordinarily 50 to 250 C and preferably 60 to 2000C. If the heating temperature is too low, curing or drying is insufficient, and if the heating temperature is too high, thermal degradation is caused, resulting in occurrence of such troubles as yellowing. Furthermore, curing may be effected with radiation such as ultraviolet rays, electron beams or gamma rays by utilizing curable functional groups, for example, double bonds in a polymer or prepolymer. In the cured multilayer antireflective coating, it is indispensable that the refractive index nI of the layer contiguous to the substrate and the refractive index nO of the outermost layer satisfy the requirements of n1 nO and n1 n5 , in which nS represents the refractive index of the substrate the coating material in case of the coated substrate . It is preferred that nI be higher by at least 0.03, more preferably by at least 0.05, than nO and ns. In case of a three layer antireflective coating, it is preferred that the requirement of nS nI nM be satisfied in which nS and n1 are as defined above and nM represents the refractive index of the intermediate layer, and it also is preferred that the film thickness dM of the intermediate layer satisfy the following requirement EMI15.1 Furthermore, it is preferred that nM be higher by at least 0.03, more preferably by at least 0.05, than nI. In coating the compositions for the respective layers of the multilayer antireflective coating, the adhesion can be improved if the layers contiguous to each other are subjected to a chemical or physical treatment. In the present invention, it is indispensable that the innermost and outermost lavers thickness of the of the antireflective coating and most desirably that of the intermediate layer, if present, be within the range satisfying the above mentioned requirement. If the above mentioned relation between the thickness and the refractive index is not established in the respective layers of the antireflective coating, no substantial antireflective effect can be attained. When the two layer antireflective coating is compared with the three layer antireflective coating, it is seen that the former coating is advantageous in that the frequency of the coating operation is reduced and a product having a good uniformity and a good dyestuff permeability can easily be obtained, while the former coating is inferior in that the reflectance is readily influenced by the thickness unevenness and when the reflectance is set at a predetermined value, the range for selection of the color of reflected light is restricted. The transparent material having the above mentioned antireflective coating is effectively used for a vehicle window or building window, an optical lens such as an eyeglass lens or camera lens or a cover for various display devices, especially a CRT filter cathode ray tube filter .In case of a CRT filter, if a circular polarization plate is used as the substrate, rays transmitted through the filter drastically attenuate rays reflected on the surface of CRT and simultaneously attenuate rays reflected from the filter. Thus, a characteristic antireflective filter can be provided. Since the antireflective coating of the present invention has a dyestuff permeability, the dyeable substrate or coated substrate can be dyed in the present invention. For example, in case of a plastic eyeglass lens, for protection of eyes and improvement of the fashion property, there is often adopted a method in which the lens is partially or entirely colored by dyeing. However, since antireflective coatings formed by the conventional antireflective processing method utilizing the vacuum evaporation deposition technique have no dyestuff permeability, for attaining the antireflective effect and coloring lenses, there has heretofore been adopted a method in which a lens substrate is dyed in advance or an originally colored lens substrate is used and the lens substrate is subjected to an antireflective treatment.Antireflective colored lenses formed according to this method, however, involve the following problems. 1 Since a high degree of vacuum is necessary for forming an antireflective coating by the vacuum evaporation deposition method, the density and hue of the colored lens to be treated are changed by the antireflective coating forming operation, and therefore, the reproducibility is poor. 2 Since formation of the antireflective coating is carried out after coloration of the lens, requirements for a variety of colorations cannot easily be satisfied. 3 In the case where an error is made at the antireflective treatment step, correction is difficult, and the manufacturing cost is significantly influenced. In the case where the antireflective coating of the present invention is employed, since the antireflective coating is first formed and the dyeing operation is then carried out, the foregoing disadvantages can be eliminated. The dyeing referred to in the present invention includes not only entirely uniform dyeing or graduated dyeing of the lens or antireflective coating with an organic dyestuff such as a disperse dye, a basic dye, an acid dye or a metal complex dye but also pattern dyeing using a transfer sheet.The properties of the dyestuff should be controlled appropriately according to the intended use by using water, a paste, a dyeing assistant, a leveling agent, a pH control agent and the like. In order to increase the dyeing speed and density, an organic chemical carrier may be added to the dyestuff to enhance the dyeing characteristics.A viscous pasty dye solution thus prepared is applied to the antireflective coating according to the screen printing method or the like, or pattern dyeing can be accomplished according to a method in which a pattern is printed on a flexible substrate such as paper, cloth or film with the dye paste, the printed substrate is applied to the antireflective coating to produce a close adhesion state between the surfaces of the dye layer and the antireflective coating and the assembly is subjected to a dry or wet heat treatment at 60 to 2000C for 10 minutes to 2 hours to effect transfer of the dye to the coating and fixation of the dye. After the dyeing operation, the excessive dye paste or dye supporting layer is removed by washing with warm water or cold water. As the dyestuff, there may be used not only coloring dyes having an absorption in the visible wavelength region but also photochromic dyes to be colored by ultraviolet rays and fluorescent dyes emitting fluorescence. The transparent material having the antireflective coating according to the present invention has the following effects in addition to the antireflective effect. 1 The transparent material can be dyed with a disperse dye or the like. 2 The heat resistance and hot water resistance are excellent. 3 The surface hardness is high and the transparent material has a high scratch resistance. 4 The chemical resistance is excellent.

The mixture was sufficiently stirred and 15.5 g of tetra n butyl titanate was added, and the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred to form a coating composition. 2 Preparation of coating Composition for Second Layer a Preparation of Silane Hydrolyzate 19.8 g of an aqueous 0.05N hydrochloric acid solution was added dropwise to 56.5 g of Y glycidoxy propyltrimethoxysilane and 24.0 g of vinyltriethoxysilane with stirring while controlling the temperature to 100C.After completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour to obtain a silane hydrolyzate. b Preparation of Coating Composition To 39.3 g of the above mentioned silane hydrolyzate were added 150.5 g of n propanol, 71.2 g of water, 23.9 g of ethyl cellosolve, 32.5 g of the same colloidal silica dispersed in methanol as used in Example 1, 0.22 g of a silicone type surfactant and 0.98 g of aluminum acetylacetonate, and the mixture was sufficiently stirred to obtain a coating composition. 3 Coating and Curing A diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate polymer lens Plano lens CR 39, 75 mm in diameter and 2.1 mm in thickness , which had been dipped in an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and then washed, was spin coated with the coating composition prepared in 1 above under conditions described below. The coated lens was heated and dried at 900C for 1 hour. Spin Coating Conditions Rotation number 3500 rpm Rotation time 60 seconds The heated lens was dipped in hot water maintained at 400C for 1 hour and was then heated and dried at llO C for 1 hour. The coating composition for the second layer, prepared in 2 b above, was spin coated on the obtained first layer under the same conditions as adopted for formation of the first layer, and the coated lens was heated and cured for 2 hours in an air drying oven at 930C. 4 Test Reuslts The luminous transmittance of the obtained lens was 96.7 , and the reflected light of the obtained antireflective lens had a reddish violet color. The luminous transmittance of the lens before the above mentioned antireflective treatment was 92.68. The antireflective lens was dyed at 900C for 30 minutes in a dyeing solution obtained by dispersing and dissolving a mixture of red, blue and yellow disperse dyes in water. The lens was dyed to such an extent that the luminous transmittance was reduced to 40.6 . The antireflective effect was not reduced by the dyeing treatment at all. Example 16 The procedures of Example 15 were repeated in the same manner except that a lens which had been undercoated in the same manner as described in 2 of Example 2 was used as the substrate. The luminous transmittance of the obtained lens was 96.2 . The reflected light had a reddish violet color. When the abrasion resistance of the obtained lens was examined by using steel wool 0000, it was found that scratches were hardly formed by the abrasion. This antireflective lens was dyed at 900C for 30 minutes in a dyeing solution obtained by dispersing and dissolving a mixture of red, blue and yellow disperse dyes in water. The lens was dyed to such an extent that the luminous transmittance was reduced to 54.9 . The antireflective effect was not reduced by the dyeing treatment at all. The luminous transmittance of the under coated lens which was not subjected to the above antireflective treatment was 92.78 . The reflective photospectrum of the obtained antireflective lens was determined to obtain results shown in Fig. 2. Comparative Example 6 An antireflective lens was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 16 except that the undercoated lens was dyed with a red dye prior to the antireflective treatment.Dissolution of the red dye into the coating composition for the first layer was observed, and the coating composition became red. Example 17 The procedures of Example 16 were repeated in the same manner except that the lens used was changed to a diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate polymer lens of 4.00 diopters. The obtained antireflective lens had the same properties as those of the antireflective lens obtained in Example 16. Example 18 The procedures of Example 16 were repeated in the same manner except that the lens used was changed to a diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate polymer lens of 2.00 diopters. The obtained antireflective lens had the properties as those of the antireflective lens obtained in Example 16. Example 19 The procedures of Example 16 were repeated in the same manner except that the lens used was changed to an inorganic glass lens 65 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in thickness . The luminous transmittance of the obtained antireflective lens was 94.8 . The obtained lens was dyed in the same manner as in Example 16 except that the dyeing time was changed to 3 hours. The lens was dyed to such an extent that the luminous transmittance was reduced to 70.0 .Incidentally, the luminous transmittance of the untreated lens was 91.9 .
