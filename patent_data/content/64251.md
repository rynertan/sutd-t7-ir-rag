# Damped bearing device.

## Abstract
A damped bearing device operative to damp vibration acting on a bearing journalling a rotary shaft includes a spring body 3 resiliently supporting the bearing 2 with respect to a housing 4 . The spring body 3 includes a spring portion 3a arranged on the outer peripheral side of the bearing 2 to minimize the axial dimensions of the bearing device without increasing the stress produced in the spring portion 3a of the spring body 3 .
