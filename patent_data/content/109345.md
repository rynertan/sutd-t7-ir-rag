# Vortex shedding flow measuring transducer.

## Abstract
A vortex shedding flow measuring transducer 10 in cludes an optical conductor 20 cantilevered to a conduit 15 accommodating the flow and an optical receiver 35 which in tercepts an optical signal from the conductor as the conductor vibrates in response to vortices shed therefrom due to fluid flow thereover.
