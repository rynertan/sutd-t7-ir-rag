# Tandem mass spectrometer and method of operating a mass spectrometer system.

## Abstract
A tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer system in which an AC only section 6 is close coupled with a standard AC DC section 8 with the rods of the two sections closely longitudinally adjacent each other. The rods of the AC voltage only section 6 are of open structure, formed by thin wires to allow gas to be introduced into the system and to escape through the open structure rods 14 2 . The system is suited for use with a tandem quadrupole system consisting of three sections, namely an AC DC section 4 , an AC only section 6 and an AC DC section 8 all close coupled, with a target gas 29 introduced into the AC only section 6 to perform frag mentation of ions traveling through the system. In one arrangement the rods 14 of the AC only section 6 have solid centre portions 14 1 between which the target gas is introduced, and open structure end portions 14 2 through which the target gas may flow away so that little of it enter the end AC DC sections 4,8 .
