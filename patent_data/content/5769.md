## Description
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for producing methacrolein and methacrylic acid by oxidizing isobutylene and or tertiary butanol with molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas in the vapor phase in the presence of the specific type catalyst.Most of prior art processes proposed for producing unsaturated monocarboxylic acids from corresponding olefins consist of two steps In the first step, corresponding aldehydes are produced by the use of a catalyst and, in the second step, the unsaturated aldehydes are converted to corresponding unsaturated carboxylic acids by the use of a catalyst different from one used in the first step. Only a few catalysts are known which are effective for preparing unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by oxidizing corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbon by a single step, but when these catalysts are used, the yield of the unsaturated monocarboxylic acid is generally very low. Especially few catalysts are known for producing methacrylic acid by oxidation of isobutylene in one step, which, if any, have a disadvantage that the yield of methacrylic acid is very low.The inventors of the present application have made an earnest study and accomplished the invention on the discovery that the catalyst according to this invention shows high activity and high selectivity even at low temperature in the oxidation of isobutylene and or tertiary butanol to methacrylic acid. This invention relates to a process for producing methacrolein and methacrylic acid by the vapor phase oxidation of isobutylene and or tertiary butanol with molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas in the presence of the catalyst represented by the following formula MoaVbPcXdOe wherein X represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of Cu, Ag, Zn, Cd, Al, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ce, Th, Re, Cr, B, K, Rb, and Cs, and a, b, c, d and e represent the atomic ratio of the elements where, a is 10, b is a number of 6 or less than 6 excluding 0, preferably 0.5 to 3, c is a number of 0.5 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 3, d is a number of 0.01 to 5, preferably 0.01 to 2.0, and e is a number determined depending on the valency and atomic ratio of the other elements present and is usually a number of 35 to 80 . From the point of view of the formula, the preferred catalyst is the one represented by the following formula MOa, Vb Pc Cud, X e Of wherein X represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of tin, thorium, aluminum, geranium, nickel, iron, cobalt, potassium, rubidium, cesium, zinc, titanium, lead, rhenium, zirconium, chromium and bismuth, and a , b , c , d , e and f represent the atomic ratio of the respective elements, where a is 10, b is a number of 6 or less than 6 excluding 0, preferably 0.5 to 3, c is a number of 0.5 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 3.0, d is a number of 3 or less than 3 excluding 0, preferably 0.01 to 1.0, e is a number of 3 or less than 3 excluding 0, preferably 0.01 to 1.0, provided that d e is a number of 0.01 to 5 and f is a number determined depending on the valency and atomic ratio of the other elements present and is usually a number of 35 to 80 .The catalyst of the present invention can be prepared by the general methods for preparing the known oxidation catalysts such as oxide catalysts or catalysts having heteropoly acid structure or heteropoly acid salt structure.There is no limitation to select starting materials to be used for the preparation of the catalyst and thus various materials are usable. The starting materials usable for the molybdenum component include, for example, ammonium molybdate, molybdic acid, molybdenum oxide and the like. The starting materials usable for the vanadium component include, for example, ammonium metavanadate, vanadium pentoxide and the like. The starting materials usable for the phosphorus component include, for example, phosphoric acid or its salts, and polyphosphoric acid or its salts.The starting materials usable for the component X include, for example, corrresponding nitrates, sulfates, carbonates, phosphates, organic acid salts, halides, hydroxides and oxides of the elements X, that is copper, silver, zinc, cadmium, germanium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, aluminum, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, titanium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, cerium, thorium, rhenium, chromium, boron, potassium, rubidium, and cesium.The catalyst of the invention can be prepared, for example, by reacting the starting materials for the constituent elements in water or in an organic solvent under heating, evaporating the reaction product to dryness and, if necessary, calcining the dried product.In case the calcination is required, the calcination temperature is preferably in the range of 200 5000C and more preferably in the range of 250 4300C. Though the catalyst of the invention shows high catalytic acitivity without being supported on any carriers, preferable effects, such as improvements in thermal stability and the catalyst life and increase in the yield of methacrolein or methacrylic acid can be expected by supporting it on a suitable carrier. Preferred carriers include silicon carbide, cfralumina, aluminum powder, diatomaceous earth, titanium oxide and the like. From the point of view of the structure of the catalyst, the preferred catalyst in the invention is one which has heteropolyacid structure. The basic structure of the catalyst is phosphovanadomolybdic acid and other constituent elements are considered to contribute to the improvements in the catalytic activity and selectivity as well as in the stability of the structure by partially replacing the constituent elements in the phosphovanadomolybdic acid and being incorporated into the structure of the heteropoly acid. The catalyst having such heteropoly acid structure have very long catalyst life. The heteropoly acid structure can be identified by the characteristicX ray diffraction peaks observed at 20 8.0 , 8.90, 9.3 and the like. The presence of large amount of ammonium ions in the heteropoly acid structure is not favorable, since such catalyst has not a long life. In order to prepare catalysts having very long life, the number of ammonium ions in the catalyst having the heteropoly acid structure should preferably be limited to below 1, most preferably below 0.5, per 10 molybdenum atoms.The catalyst having the heteropoly acid structure can be readily prepared by general methods for preparing heteropoly acids.For example, the catalyst having the heteropoly acid structure can be prepared by reacting the starting materials for the constituent elements in water or in an organic solvent, and evaporating to dryness. In the oxidation reaction according to the process of the invention, isobutylene and or tertiary butanol and molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas are used as reactants. The molar ratio of the molecular oxygen to isobutylene and or tertiary butanol is preferably in the range of 0.5 to 20, more preferably 1 to 10. ln order to make the reaction to proceed smoothly, it is preferred to add water vapor to the feed gas in a molar ratio to the isobutylene and or tertiary butanol of 1 to 20. The addition of water promotes the desorption of the products, methacrolein and methacrylic acid, from the catalyst surface and control the temperature of the catalyst bed.The feed gas to be supplied may further contain other inert gases such as, for example nitrogen, carbon dioxide, saturated hydrocarbons and the like.The reaction of the invention may be conducted at a temperature of 25o0C to 4000C, more preferably 2800C to 3800C and at a space velocity SV between 100 her 1 and 6000 hurl, more preferably 400 hr 1 and 3000 her 1 based on the NTP standard.Since the increase in the space velocity has no substantial effect on the results of the reaction where the catalyst of this invention is employed, the reaction can be conducted at a high space velocity.While the catalytic reaction can be carried out at a pressure either above or below the atmospheric pressure, it is suitably carried out generally at a pressure near the atmospheric pressure.The preferred pressure for the reaction in this invention lies between 1 and 5 atm.The reaction of this invention can be conducted in any desired type of reactor such as a fixed bed, a fluidized bed or a moving bed reactor. In the following examples, the number of oxygen in the catalyst compositions are not represented since the number of oxygen is determined in accordance with the atomic ratio and valency of the other constituent elements.The conversion, the yield of methacrolein, the yield of methacrylic acid and the selectivity to both methacrolein and methacrylic acid are defined as follows Conversion moles of isobutylene reacted moles tertiary butanol reacted x 100 moles of isobutylene fed moles of tertiary butanol fedYield of methacrolein moles of methacrolein produced x 100 moles of isobutylene fed moles of tertiary butanol fedYield of methacrylic acid moles of methacrylic acid produced x 100 moles of isobutylene fed moles of tertiary butanol fed Selectivity to methacrolein methacrylic acid yield of methacrolein yield of methacrylic acid x 100 ConversionExample Al 100 g of molybdenum trioxide, 6.3 g of vanadium pentoxide, 1.1 g of copper oxide, and 8.0 g of orthophosphoric acid were dispersed or dissolved in 1000 ml of deionized water.

The catalyst were confirmed to be heteropoly acid by the observation of X ray diffraction peaks at 28 8.00, 8.90 and 9.3 and the like.The catalyst was ground to 24 to 28 mesh and then charged into a tubular reactor made of Pylex glass of 18 mm in inside diameter and the reactor was immersed in a fluidized bath.
