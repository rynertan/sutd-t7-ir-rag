# PREPARATION OF NITRO COMPOUNDS BY VAPOR PHASE NITRATION OF OXYGENATED HYDROCARBONS

## Abstract
Nitro compounds are selectively formed by contacting, at elevated temperature and pressure and in a homoge neous gas phase, an organic oxygenated hydrocarbon hav ing from two to ten carbon atoms with NOâ‚‚ alone or in the presence of oxygen and or water.
