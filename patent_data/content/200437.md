# Improved fluid operated ram.

## Abstract
A drive ram, particularly for a yarn winder, has the piston rod 6 freely movable relative to both the piston 11 and the ram cylinder 17, 22 in a first condition in which a locking washer 16 is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the piston rod 6 . Upon application of fluid pressure to effect relative movement of the piston 11 and the cylinder 17, 22 , the locking washer 16 is spring urged against a wedge like tipping washer 19 which skews the locking washer 16 and causes it to clamp the piston rod 6 whereby the piston rod is then driven by the ram through a predetermined travel, from a starting position which is governed only by the diameter of the package at the time of operation of the package lift mechanism. This allows a virtually constant lift travel of the ram, regardless of the diameter of the package at the time of operation of the ram.
