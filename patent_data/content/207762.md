# Method of formatting storage medium and drive unit therefor.

## Abstract
A method for formatting a storage medium into sectors each containing an ID field for storing ID information. The ID information includes addresses of a plurality of sectors, preferably the address of the sector containing the ID field and the address of at least one subsequent sector. Also disclosed in a drive unit for use with the storage medium formatted as described above. The drive unit reads the ID information from the ID field, then temporarily stores either the ID information of a sector other than the sector containing the ID field or the result of an evaluation of the ID information, and refers to the stored ID information when the address of the sector corresponding to the stored information is later examined.
