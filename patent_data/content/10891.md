In the present specification and claims, the term sterically compatible is employed to designate X and Z substituent groups.which are not affected by steric hindrance as defined in The Condensed Chemical Dicionary , 7th edition, Reinhold Publishing Co. N.Y., page 893 1966 which definition is as follows stoic hindrance. A characteristic of molecular structure in which the molecules have a spatial arrangement of their atoms such that a given reaction with another molecule is prevented or retarded in rate. The triazolyl phosphorous compounds of the present invention possess excellent insecticidal properties and are very useful for the control of insects and for the protection of plants and stored goods from destruction by insects. The phosphorous compounds of. the present invention are crystalline solids or liquids which are sparingly soluble in water and which are soluble in most organic solvents. A preferred group of compounds are those whereinR isEMI3.1 R2is C1 to C3 alkyl R3 is C1 to C3 alkoxy X is chloro, fluoro, bromo or phenoxy n is 0 or 1 and R1 is C1 to C3 alkyl, C1 to Cz alkoxy or C1 to C2 dialkylamino. The triazolyl phosphorous compounds of the present invention can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate substituted 3 hydroxy or an alkali metal salt thereof which corresponds to the formulaEMI3.2 with a phosphoric acid halide corresponding to the formula EMI4.1 in the presence of an acid binding agent and a solvent.In the above formulae, R, R3, R2,and R are as hereinbefore defined Me represents sodium, potassium, lithium or Ce. urn and X represents chloro or bromo. In carrying out this reaction, the 3 hydroxytriazole reactant or the alkali metal salt thereof, in a solvent, is mixed with the phosphoric acid halide and the mixture heated at a temperature of from 20 C up to the boiling point of the specific solvent employed. The reaction can be carried out if desired in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction is usually complete in from 0.1 to 24 hours. The reaction consumes the reactants in stoichiometric proportions, i.e. one equivalent of the 3 hydroxytriazole reactant per equivalent of the phosphoric acid halide and for the most part, these amounts can be employed. It shouid be noted however, that the actual amount of the reactants to be employed is not critical as some of the desired product is formed when employing any proportions. The alkali metal salt of 3 hydroxytriazole reactant can be prepared by the reaction of molecular equivalent amounts of the 3 hydroxytriazole and an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate in the presence of a solvent at temperatures of from 20 C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent employed for from 10 minutes to 4 hours. From a practical standpoint, the salt conversion is usually carried out in situ. In addition, it is preferred to employ the alkali metal salt since during the subsequent reaction with the phosphorous acid halide, an insoluble alkali petal halide by product is formed rather than an acid and no acid binding agent is necessary.Additionally, the insoluble salt can be easily removed allowing for a more convenient product recovery. Representative catalysts useful in carrying out this process include tertiary amines having a pKa of at least 9.5, co catalysts which are mixtures of quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts and organic tertiary amines which include quaternary ammonium compounds such as tetraalkylammonium salts, such as tetra n butyl , tetrahexyl , tri n butylmethyl , cetyltrimethyl , trioctylmethyland tridecylmethyl ammonium chlorides, bromides, bisulfates, tosylates, etc. aralkylammonium salts, such as tetrabenzylammonium chloride, benzyltrimethyl , benzyltriethyl , benzyltributyl , and phenethyl trimethylammonium chlorides, bromides, etc. arylammonium salts, such as triphenylmethylammonium fluoride, chloride or bromide, N,N,N trimethylanilinium bromide, N, N diethyl N methylanilinium bisulfate, trimethylnaphthylammonium chloride, p methylphenyltrimethylammonium chloride or tosylate, etc. 5and 6 membered heterocyclic compounds containing at least one quaternized nitrogen atom in the ring, such as N methylpyridinium chloride or methyl sulfate, N hexyl pyridinium iodide, 4 pyridyl trimethylammonium chloride, l methyl 1 azabicyclo 2.2. ljheptane bromide, N,N dibutylmorpholinium chloride, N ethylthiazolium chloride, N butylpyrrolium chlorides, etc., and the corresponding phosphonium salts. The ammonium salts are currently preferred over the phosphonium salts due to cost and commercial availablity. The most preferred catalysts are benzyltrimethyl , . triethyl tetra n butyl and tri n butylmethyl ammonium salts. Examples of suitable tertiary amines include aliphatic trihydrocarbyl amines e.g. trimethylamine, ethyldimethylamine, butyldimethylamine, N,N,N ,N tetra methylethyleflediamine, and the like aliphatic heterocyclic amines e.g. l,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2joctane1 1 azabi cyclol2.2.2 octane, l methyl 2 imidazoline, 1 methylpyrrolidine, and the like mixed aliphatic aromatic amines e. g. 4 dimethylaminopyridine, 4 N pyrrolidion pyridine phenyldimethylamine, and other like organic , sterically unhindered, nucleophilic, tertiary amines. Examples of suitable diazoles include imidazole, 1 methylimidazole, l ethylimidazole, l propylimidazole, l hexylimidazole pyrazole, 1 methylpyrazole, 1 ethylpyrazole, 1 butylpyrazole, 1 amylpyrazole and 1 hexylpyrazole, and the like. Other catalysts include a heavy metal or heavy metal salt such as, for example, metallic copper or mercuric chloride. If a catalyst is employed, it can be added at any stage of the process. In order to achieve the best yield, it is preferred that the catalyst be added at the beginning of the reaction. If, however, the catalyst is a tertiary amine, it is preferred that it be added just prior to the addition of the phosphorous acid chloride. Suitable acid binding agents are, for example, organic amines such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline, pyridine, inorganic bases such as the hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, or lithium. These agents are employed in from about an equimolar amount up to a 10 percent excess based on the triazole reactant. Suitable solvents which can be employed are all the usual organic liquids which are inert under the reaction conditions, for example, acetone, methylethyl ketone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, polychlorobenzenes, bromobenzene, dimethylformamide, and xylene.

SEP 66 68 C tb The substituted triazol 3 ol compounds corresponding to the formulaEMI32.1 wherein R and R1 are as hereinbefore defined and which are employed as starting materials, are novel compounds and can be prepared by a variety of procedures. Those compounds wherein R1 is hydrogen can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate substituted hydrazine carboxamide with excess formic acid or triethyl orthoformate under reflux conditions with or without a solvent being present. Representative solvents include dimethyl sulfoxide, xylene and dimethylformamide. The product is thereafter recovered by cooling the reaction mixture and pouring it over ice and filtering off the solid product which precipitates. Alternatively the reaction mixture is concentrated by distillation and the solid product which precipitates is recovered by filtration. The product regardless of the method of recovery can be further purified by being either washed with a solvent and then dried or washed with water and dried.When water washing is employed it is often advantageous to neutralize the filtrate to recover any product remaining therein. Those compounds where R1 is chloro are usually prepared by chlorinating the appropriate compound whereinR1 is hydrogen. This chlorinating step employs a convention chlorinating procedure wherein chlorine gas is bubbled through the triazol 3 ol compound at 100 200C. After the chlorination is complete, the desired product is recovered by filtration. Those compounds wherein R1 is bromo or fluoro can be prepared by conventional halogen exchange procedures wherein the appropriate triazol 3 ol compound, wherein R1 is chloro, is treated with potassium bromide or cesium fluoride, respectively. The desired product is then recovered by quenching the reaction mixture with ice and filtering of the solid product. Those compounds wherein R1 is amino or alkylamino can be prepared by reacting the appropriate triazol 3 ol compound wherein R1 is chloro, fluoro or bromo with ammonia or an alkyl amine amine in the presence of a solvent such as, for example, dimethyl sulfoxide or isopropylalcohol and at temperatures in the range of about 450 to about 1500C for irom 1 to about 3 hours.The product can be separated by conventional techniques of quenching and filtration. Those compounds wherein R1 is alkoxy, alkylthio or phenylthio can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate triazol 3 ol compound wherein R1 is chloro, bromo, or fluoro and an appropriate alkali metal alkoxide, alkali metal alkyl or phenylmercaptide, in the presence of an organic solvent of the type conventionally employed for such reactions. In carrying out this reaction, the alkali metal is dissolved in an alcohol corresponding to the alkyl or phenyl group being added. The alkali metal oxy compound is inherently formed and is employed as 7uch in the following reactions The mercaptide is formed by adding the appropriate mercaptan to the alcohol solution. To the appropriate above mixture is added the triazol 3 ol reactant and the resulting mixture is refluxed for a time sufficient to complete the reaction, usually from about 1 to about 3 hours. The reaction products are filtered to remove any alkali metal halide, followed by solvent removal by evaporation, distillation or other conventional separatory procedures, leaving the desired product. Those compounds wherein R1 is alkylsulfinyl or sulfonyl can be prepared by reacting an appropriate triazol 3 ol with an oxidizing agent. The oxidation of any of the alkylthio substituted compounds results, at least partially, in the formation of the corresponding alkylsulfinyl substituted compound. The oxidation of one molecular of the alkylthio substituted compound to the corresponding alkylsulfinyl substituted compound or the oxidation of one molecule of a alkylsulfinyl compound to the corresponding alkylsulfonyl compound requires one atom of oxygen for each sulfur atom oxidized. The oxidation of the alkylthio compound directly to the corresponding alkylsulfonyl compound, on the other hand, consumes two atoms of oxygen for each sulfur atom so oxidized. In carrying out the various oxidation reactions to prepare the sulfonyl compounds of the present invention, it is preferable to employ an excess of the oxidizing agent, whereas in preparing the sulfinyl compounds, it is preferable not to provide oxygen appreciably in excess of the stoichiometric quantities consumed in the conversion and to employ milder reaction conditions and or oxidants. In many instances, the alkylsulfinyl compounds can be prepared and subjected to continuing oxidative conditions so as to be further oxidized in situ to the conditions so as to be further oxidized in situ to the corresponding sulfonyl compound. In some instances, depending on the oxidizing agent and process conditions, the oxidation proceeds to the sulfonyl compound so rapidly that it is not practical to isolate the sulfinyl compound.Representative oxidizing agents for the production of the sulfinyl compounds include nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide and representative oxidizing agents to be employed in the preparation of the sulfonyl compounds include hydrogen peroxide, and perbenzoic acid. Hydrogen peroxide, .and conveniently an aqueous solution thereof, can be employed as the oxidizing agent in the production of the sulfinyl and sulfonyl containing derivatives of the present invention. In such embodiment, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a liquid reaction medium, such as trifluoroacetic acid, glacial acetic acid or a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. In a preferred procedure, the acid anhydride mixture is employed as the liquid reaction medium. The reaction takes place at temperatures of from about 75 to about 1200C. In a convenient method, the reaction is carried out at the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture and under reflux. In carrying out the reaction, the reactants are contracted in any order or fashion, and preferably in amounts stoichiometric for the preparation of the desired product. The reaction mixture is then maintained at a temperature within the reaction temperature range until the desired degree of conversion is achieved. Following the reaction period, the sulfinyl or sulfonyl product can be separated by conventional procedures such as evaporation of the reaction medium to obtain the product as a solid residue. In an alternative procedure, the reaction mixture is washed with cold water and is thereafter filtered, centrifuged or the like to obtain the crystalline product. Nitric acid is conveniently employed to oxidize the alkylthio starting material to the corresponding sulfinyl derivative. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of a halocarbon reaction medium such as carbon tetrachloride, methylene dichloride, ethylene dibromide, etc. In a preferred procedure, excess nitric acid is employed as the reaction medium. The reaction proceeds at temperatures between about 150 and about 1200C. Preferably, the reaction is carried out under reflux conditions at temperatures of from 80 to 1200C and requires only a short period of time for completion, i.e., about 2 to about 7 minutes.Conveniently, the reactants are mixed and lshe temperature is allowed to rise to the desired temperature and maintained at or about this temperature during the refluxing. In an additional procedure, chlorine water can also be employed as the oxidizing agent in the preparation of alkylsulfinyl or sulfonyl derivatives from the corresponding alkylthio derivatives. When employing chlorine water as an oxidizing agent, a slurry of the alkylthio containing compound to be oxidized is prepared in water and the slurry agitated while chlorine gas is bubbled in.The mixture is maintained at room temperature until no starting alkylthio material is left unoxidized. If it is desired to convert the sulfinyl compound to the sulfonyl state, the temperature is raised to about 900C and the mixture maintained at this temperature until oxidation is complete. Those compounds wherein R1 is alkyl are prepared by the reaction of an appropriate substituted hydrazine carboxamide with an excess of an appropriate triethylorthoester under reflux conditions in the presence or absence of a solvent. Representative solvents include dimethylsulfoxide and xylene. The product is thereafter recovered as set forth hereinbefore for compounds whereinR is hydrogen. Representative ester reactants include compounds corresponding to the formula R4 C OC2H5 3 4.wherein R is methyl, ethyl or propyl. Specific compounds include triethyl ortho acetate, triethyl ortho propionate and triethyl ortho butyrate. Those compounds wherein R1 is phenyl can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate 2 benzoyl 2 2 pyridinyl hydrazine carboxamide with an alkali metal hydroxide, at a temperature of from 250 to 750C for from one minute to one hour, followed by acidifying the reaction product. Those compounds wherein R1 is methylthiomethyl can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate triazol 3 01 compound wherein R1is chloromethyl with an alkali metal methylmercaptide in the presence of an organic solvent of the type conventionally employed for such reactions under reflux conditions. Those compounds wherein R1 is hydroxymethyl can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate triazol 3 ol compound wherein R1 is chloromethyl with an alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of an organic solvent of the type conventionally employed for such reactions. Those compound wherein R1 is thiocyanato can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate triazol 3 ol compound wherein R1 is chloro, bromo or fluoro and an appropriate alkali metal thiocyanate under reflux conditions for a time sufficient to complete the reaction, usually from about 1 to about 3 hours. The reaction products are filtered to remove any alkali metal halide, followed by solvent removal by evaporation, distillation or other conventional separatory procedures, leaving the desired product. Those compounds wherein R1 is chloromethyl or trichloromethyl can be prepared by the selective chlorination of the appropriate compounds wherein R1 is methyl.In this procedure, chlorine gas is passed into the appropriate triazol 3 ol compound at temperatures of from 200 to 300C in the presence of a solvent such as carbon tetrachloride for a period of from 30 minutes to 5 hours in the presence of UV light. Those compounds yherein RÚ is trifluoromethyl can be prepared by halogen exchange whereby the appropriate trichloromethyl substituted compound is treated with antimony trifluoride under conventional halogen exchange conditions.

By following the preparative procedures set forth above, the desired substituted hydrazine compounds were prepared. The new triazolyl phosphates of the present invention possess excellent insecticidal and acaracidal properties and are very suitable for the control of chewing and sucking insects for the protection of plants and stored goods. The compounds penetrate into the tissues of plants and are highly effective as contact and stomach poison insecticides. Owing to their low toxicity to warm blooded animals, they are also suitable for the control of ecto and endo parasites on and in animals. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be employed for the control of one or more of the following arthropods, among others, and their various stages of development larvae and eggs insects of the families Muscidae and Culicidae, house flies Musca domestica , stable flies Stomoxys calcitrans and mosquitoes e.g. Aedes Aegypti, Culex fatigans, Anopheles stephensi against insects of the families Curculonidae,Bruchidae, Dermestidae, Tenebrionidae and Chrysomelidae, e.g. granary weevils Silophilus granarius , bean beetles Bruchidus obtectus , larder beetles Dermestes vulpinus , mealworms Tenebrio molitor , Colorado potato beetles Leptinotarsadecemlineata and their larval stages against insects of the family Pyralididae, e.g.Mediterranean flour moths Ephestia kuhniella , of the family Blattidae, cockroaches Blattella germanica, Periplaneta americana, Blatta orientalis , of the family Aphididae, e.g. green peach aphids Myzus persicae , of the family Pseudococcidae, e.g. citrus mealybugs Planococcus citri and of the family Locustidae, e.g. migratory locusts Locusta migratoria , arachnids including the families Acaridae, Ixodidae, Tetranychidae and Argasidae. In their use as insecticides, an insecticidal amount of the phosphorous compound per se or a composition incorporating an insecticidal amount of the compound is used as the toxicant for contact with the pest insect or its habitat. The insecticidal amount, of course, is that quantity which elicits toxic mortality among the treated pests. Generally, such insecticidal response results by contacting the target pests or their habitat with a composition containing from 0.00001 to 99 or more percent of the active compound in the total composition. Good results are achieved upon contact with a composition containing about 1000 parts of the active compound per million by weight. Suitable compositions include those which are in the form of liquid solutions, liquid emulsifiable concentrates, and dust or granular preparations. Such can be further diluted as and where appropriate with convention diluents. Liquid compositions containing the active compound are prepared by dissolving the active compound in a suitable inert organic solvent such as acetone, toluene, xylene, methylene chloride, chlorobenzene, ethyl ether or petroleum distillates or by dispersing the active compound in water with or without the aid of a suitable surface acting dispersing agent such as can be provided by ionic or nonionic dispersing and emulsifying agents. The aqueous compositions may contain one or more water immiscible solvents for the toxicants. In such compositions, the carrier comprises an aqueous emulsion, that is, a mixture of water immiscible solvent, emulsifying agent and water. The choice of dispersing and or emulsifying agent and the amounts thereof employed is dictated by the nature of the composition type and by the ability of the agent to facilitate the dispersion of the active toxic ant compound in the aqueous carrier to produce the desired composition. Dispersing and emulsifying agents which may be employed in the compositions incude the condensation products of alkylene oxides with phenols and organic acids, alkylarylsulfonates, polyoxyethylene derivatives or sorbitan esters, complex ether alcohols, mahogany soaps, and the like.In such compositions, the surface active agents are usually employed in the amount of from 1 to 20 percent by weight of the combined weight of the surface active agent and the active compound. In the preparation of dust compositions, the active compound is dispersed in and on a finely divided inert solid such as talcum, chalk, gypsum, and the like.In such operations, the carriers are mechanically ground with the compounds or wet with a volatile organic solvent solution thereof. Similarly, dust compositions containing the compound may be prepared from bentonite, fullers earth, attapulgite, and other clays. Depending upon the proportions of ingredients, these dust compositions may be employed as concentrates and subsequently diluted with additional solid surface acting dispersing agent or with talc, chalk, or gypsum and the like to obtain a desired amount of active agent in a composition adapted to be applied for insect control. Also, such concentrate dust compositions may be dispersed in water with or without the aid of a dispersing agent to form spray mixtures. Granular formulations are conveniently prepared by impregnations, such as through simple mechanical mixing, of the active compound in a presized carrier, usually of the type hereinbefore set forth. In practice, the active compound is distributed so as to provide contact of the target insect with toxic amounts of the active compound. Such contact can be achieved through direct contact of the active compound with the target insect of by more indirect means such as by application to its food and or habitat. Thus, for example, the active compound hereof or a composition thereof can be spread throughout the environs of the target host so as to both provide direct and indirect contact thereof or bait compositions incorporating a toxic amount of the active compound or composition thereof can be readily prepared and strategically located so as to provide ultimate contact of the host species therewith. The following examples serve to further typify the nature of the present invention and are given solely for the purpose of illustration. Example XVIII 25 parts by weight of one of compounds 9, 12, or 15, 60 parts of fuller s earth, 10 parts of diatomaceous earth, 3 parts of an alkyl aryl sulfonate Naccanol NR and 2 parts of a polymerized sodium salt of a substituted benzoid alkyl sulfonic acid Daxad No. 27 are mechanically mixed and ground together to prepare a concentrate composition in the form of a wettable powder. In a like manner, 6 parts by weight of one of compounds 25, 26 or 27, 2 parts of Naccanol NR, 2 parts of Daxad No. 27, and 200 parts of water are ballmilled together to prepare a concentrate composition in the form of a water dispersible liquid. Example XIX 1 Part of one of the compounds numbered 8, 11 or 20 is mixed with 99 parts of purified kerosene to obtain an oil preparation having an active ingredient concentration of 1 percent. In application, the composition can be atomized or sprayed as is. These concentrate compositions may be further diluted in their concentrate state and or dispersed in water to prepare aqueous compositions which have desirable wetting and penetrating properties. These compositions are adapted to be employed to treat target insect life and thus distribute the active compounds to provide contact of such inert life in insecticidal concentrations. Example XX Paper cylindrical cartons about 3 5 8 inches 9.2 cms in diameter by 3 1 4 inches 8.26 cms high were fitted with wire screen on the top and bottom. Into each cage were placed 6 German cockroaches Blattela germanica . An aqueous dispersion prepared by admixing one of the hereinafter set forth compounds, which had been dissolved in a suitable inert solvent, with a predetermined amount of water and a surfactant, was sprayed on the cockroaches through the screen from a distance of about 15 inches 38.1 cms using a fine spray nozzle. At the same time, additional cockroaches were sprayed with a solvent water surfactant mixture containing no active toxicant to serve as controls.After spraying, the cockroaches were kept for 2 days.At the end of this period, the cages were examined to determine the minimum concentration in parts of active compound per million parts of the ultimate composition ppm necessary to give at least a 100 percent LC100 kill and control of the cockroaches. The results of this examination are set forth below in Table II.

Separate egg masses and apples were also treated with the control mixture. The egg masses apples were incubated under conditions conducive to the hatching of the eggs and the growth of the larvae therefrom.Ten days after treatment, the apples were examined for the presence of egg hatch and larvae. Counts of the number of larval penetration in the treated fruit were compared to the number present in the untreated control to determine the percent control obtained with the test compounds. This examination determined the minimum concentration in parts of the active compound per million parts of the ultimate dispersion necessary to give at least a 70 percent kill and control of codling moth larvae and or eggs and the results of this examination are set forth below in Table III.
