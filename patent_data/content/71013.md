# Seat belt buckle with pivoting latch.

## Abstract
The locking element or latch 5 is embodied from a metal plate and comprises a first pair of articulation tabs 13 , a second pair of tabs 19 to receive strains, these tabs being received in corresponding openings 14, 20 formed in the flanges 15 of base 1 . The retaining member 7 of the latch is guided in displacement in an L shaped cutout 26 and is associated with a floating contact with a rocker 8 articulated on ejector 4 . Push button 10 comprises engagement surfaces 34 and 35 cooperating selectively with locking member 7 and ejector 4 and ramps 18 to assist the lifting of the latch. A single spring 9 serves to actuate, and place under tension, all of the moving parts of the buckle.
