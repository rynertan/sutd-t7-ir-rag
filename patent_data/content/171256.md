# Self contained, on line, real time bulk material analyzer.

## Abstract
A complete prompt gamma ray neutron activation analysis PGNAA bulk material analyzer is self contained in a sealed and air conditioned housing. Bulk material is channeled by an open ended vertical chute having a one foot by three foot cross sectional dimension through an activation region between three neutron sources and two gamma ray detectors. The sources are symmetrically disposed on one of the three foot long sides of the chute from one end of such side to the other. The detectors are symmetrically disposed on the opposite side of the chute between positions opposing the positions of the sources on the one side of the chute. The chute is dimensioned to enable free flow of various bulk materials. It handles coal of up to a top size of four inches and with typical surface moisture contents and aglomeration characteristics. The relative dispo sition of the sources and detectors results in the measurements being independent of the lateral distribution of the bulk material within the chute. The signals produced by the detectors are continuously processed by signal processing equipment sealed within a separate compartment in the container to provide peri odic measurements of the elemental content of the bulk ma terial channeled through the activation region. A measurement of the bulk material channeled through the activation region during each periodic measurement interval is processed over several measurement intervals with the periodic elemental content measurements to provide weighted average measure ments of the elemental content of bulk material over time peri ods representing average lots of the bulk material.
