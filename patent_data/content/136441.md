# WORKING TABLE TOP FOR ELECTRIC HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES

## Abstract
A working table top for mounting on an electric house hold appliance is provided, comprising a fiberboard panel lined with plastic laminate sheets, preferably of a melamine resin or the like, and a peripheral cornice formed of a thermoplastic material, preferably ABS. In the case of a working table top made of fiberboard material, difficulties have been encountered with regard to protecting the fiberboard material against the intrusion of moisture. Known solutions to this problem have been found to be ineffective and or expensive and or to involve the formation of a raised rim portion along the periphery of the working table top. In accordance with the present invention, the borders of the cornice are coplanar with the surfaces of the laminate sheets secured respectively to the upper and lower surfaces of the fiberboard panel. Means may be provided for adjustably mounting the working table top on the upper portion of an electric household appliance.
