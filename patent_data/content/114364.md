# Electrolytic water sterilization system.

## Abstract
An electrolytic water sterilization system comprises a rate detecting cell, an oxidation cell and a silvering cell through which the water flows. The rate detecting cell is fitted with two electrodes and is partly filled with noncon ducting particles whose density is greater than water. The upwards flow of water expands the bed of particles provid ing greater free area between the electrodes. The electrical resistance between the electrodes is reduced accordingly. The current to the electrodes of the oxidation cell and the silvering cell is controlled by the detected flow rate. Prefer ably, the rate detecting cell, the oxidation cell and the silvering cell with their corresponding electrodes are com bined in one single cell.
