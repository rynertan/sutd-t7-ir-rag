# Process and apparatus for purifying compositions labeled with technetium 99m.

## Abstract
Compositions labeled with technetium 99m and suitable for administration to patients are purified by means of a filtra tion column conveniently in the form of a syringe body 10 purged of oxygen and sealed at its opposite ends. Retained by fluid passing plugs 14, 16 in the syringe body is a particulate substrate 12 such as cross linked dextran which is capable of binding reduced technetium IV oxidation state and of re taining insoluble technetium moieties such as reduced hydro lysed technetium. The substrate 12 contains a reducing agent prepared in the absence of oxygen and comprising a mixture of colloidal stannous phthalate and an antioxidant such as gentistic acid. In use, a needle is attached to one end of the syringe body in place of one seal and the composition to be purified is drawn therethrough into and through the sub strate by means of a second syringe, the needle of which is in serted through a closure seal 20 at the second end of the substrate containing syringe body.
