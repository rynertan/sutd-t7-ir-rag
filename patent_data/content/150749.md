# Composite cavity laser utilizing an intra cavity electrooptic waveguide device.

## Abstract
Optical functions such as Q switching, mode locking, cavity dumping, and modulation are generated by a simple laser arrangement which includes a gain medium and an electrically controllable, optical waveguide device optically coupled to the gain medium. The gain medium and waveguide device are either interposed between two reflective surfaces or coupled by a waveguide in order to form a single composite cavity laser structure.
