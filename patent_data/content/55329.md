# Electrostatic clutch operated printing mechanism.

## Abstract
An impact printing mechanism has an electrostatic clutch assembly, including a rotatably mounted semiconduc tive coated drum 10 and a conductive band 12 wrapped around the circumference thereof. The printing mechanism includes a printing hammer 32 and a print spring 48 for actuating the printing hammer. When a print command is issued, a voltage is applied to the band 12 to create a field between the band and the drum coating. An electrostatic force is thereby generated and when the drum is rotating slowly or synchronous with drum step motion, that motion will pull the band, pivot the hammer and compress the print spring. The potential energy stored in the spring is then ready to fire the hammer. A hammer firing command turns off the voltage pulse and discharges the field, releasing the electrostatic holding force instantaneously and firing the hammer by the compressed spring.
