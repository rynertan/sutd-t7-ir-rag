# MULTILEVEL LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A Multi Level Logic Circuit is described, with the hard ware of the circuit capable of being constructed to operate in a chosen base. The circuit includes at least a One input level detector which can receive one or more multi level inputs, b Control switching means, and c An output level generator delivering a single multi level output. Various logic gates operating in any base can be derived from the generalized circuit of this invention. Basic multi level logic gates include a n 1 complementer, where an output of n 1 a is generated from a discrete input a where n is the base for which the circuit is constructed. A complementary maximum gate is also described in which the circuit provides the n 1 complement of the highest logic level detected on input lines to the input level detector. Various other multi level logic circuits can be constructed by combining the multi level complementer, and multi level complementary maximum gates. Circuits are also described where there are more than one input level detector or control switching means to provide binary operations on inputs to the multi level logic circuits, e.g. addition, multiplication, in any desired base. Circuits are illustrated, constructed to operate in base 10. The multi level logic circuit is similar to a binary circuit in that it operates on discrete logic levels. It is not an analog circuit.
