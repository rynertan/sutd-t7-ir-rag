## Description
ORGANOPOLYSILOXYNE PHOTOSENSITIZERS AND METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION invention relates to novel photopolymerization sensitizers and to methods for their preparation comprising bonding benzophenone derivatives into oranopolysi1oxanes. Various photosensitive or photopolymerizable hereafter to be called photosensitive resins are conventionally known. Several photopolymerization sensitizers have been developed or proposed for the photopolymerization of these photosensitive resins. The required characteristics for these photopolymerization sensitizers are good sensitizing action and good miscibi3itv with the photosensitive resins. If its miscibility with photosensitive resins is poor, the polymerization sensitizer will separate from the photosensitive resins and the desired sensitization action cannot then be adequatelv achieved. When the photosensitive resin polvmerizes and hardens, nonuniformities therein are formed and the sensitizer is deposited or separated from the hardened photosensitive resin.In cases where photosensitive resins blended with the photopolvmerizatibn sensitizer are stored, long term storaqe is a p rohlem. There are many types of conventionally known photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive organo polysiloxanes and it is necessary to use photopolymerization sensitizers with these resins For this purpose, sensitizers such as 2,6 dichloro 4 nitroanlline, 9,4 ainitrophenol and other aromatic compounds Michler s ketone, benzophenone, benzoid, and other ketones and benzoquinone and other quinones are known to be effective. However, these sensitizers have the drawbacks and disadvantages described above since they are poorly miscible with photosensitive organopolvsiloxanes. Sensitizers which are miscibile with photosensitive organopolysiloxanes have been proposed in Japanese Patent Sho 51 1976 48794.They are benzophenone derivatives substituted with orq,allosiloxy groups. However, they are not perfectly miscible with photosensitive organopolysiloxanes and their syntheses are also time consuming. Therefore, they have no practical use. This invention was achieved as the result t or research bv tho present inventors in order to overcome these disadvantages of the conventional technologies.. It is an object of this invention to provide novel organopolvsiloxane photosensitizers. It is another object of this invention to provide photosensitizers which are readily miscible with photosensitive silicone resins and with photosensitive organopolysiloxanes. It is a further object of this invention to provide phoosenitizers which are relatively easily prepared and methods for their preparation. The objr rts, and others which will become obvious after considering the following sptacification and appended claims, are obtained by chemically bonding certain alkenyloxy substituted benzophenone derivatives to organopolysiloxanes or organosilanes which bear silicon bonded hydrogen atoms and optionally, further polymerizing the product bv a siloxane polvmerizing reaction.

Examples of suitable monovalent hydrocarbon groups include alkyl groups such as methyl groups, ethyl groups, propyl groups and octyl groups aryl groups such as phenyl groups, tolyl groups and xylyl groups cycloaliphatic groups such as cyclohexyl groups and arylalkyl groups such as benzyl groups, 2 phenvlethyl groups and 2 phenylpropyl groups.Examples of suitable halogenated monovalent hydrocarbon groups include 3 chloropropyl groups, 3 chloro 2 methyxlpropyl groups, 3,3, trifluoropropyl groups and chlorophenyl groups. The organopolvsiloxane sensitizers of this invention can contain, in addition to slloxane units bearing Q groups, siloxane units which are free of Q groups. Said siloxane units free of Q groups preferably have the formula P4HdSiO 4 c d 2 wherein R4 denotes those groups delineated above. The values of c, d and c d can be, independently, 0, 1, 2 or 3. Preferably, c has a value of 1, 2 or 3 and d has a value of O or 1 thereby providing siloxane units having the formulaeR4SiO372, R4SiO2 2, R34SiO1 2, R4HSiO2 2 and R24HSiO1 2. Examples 9f suitable siloxane units free of Q groups include dimethylsiloxane, methylvinylsiloxane, methylphenylsiloxane, diphenylsiloxane, methyloctylsiloxane, methyl 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl siloxane, methyl 3 chloropropyl siloxane, and other diorganosiloxanes trimethylsiloxane, dimethylvinylsiloxane, dimethlphenylsiloxane, methvlphenylvinylsiloxane, dimethyl 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl siloxane, and other triorganisiloxanes methylsiloxane, propylsiloxane, vinvlsiloxane, phenylsiloxane, 3 ,3,3 trifluoropropylsiioxane, and other monoorganosiloxanes methyl hydrogen siloxane, dimethylhydrogen siloxane, hydrogen siloxane, and other siloxanes containinq hydrogen atoms directly bonded to silicon atoms. The structure of the organopolysiloxane photosensitizer can be linear, branched, cyclic, or network. Its degree of polymerization, i.e. the number of siloxane units, is greater than 2 with an upper limit as high as the maximum possible degree of polymerization, generally about 10,000. However, it is preferable for the degree of polymerization to be less than 1,000 from the viewpoint of the miscibility of the sensitizer. It is sufficient that each molecule have at least one group possessing the benzophenone derivative structure. It is also sufficient that each molecule have at least one organosiloxane unit containing this group. At the upper limit, the organosiloxane units can all contain a group possessing the benzophenone derivative structure. Nevertheless, if the number of the groups possessing the benzophenone derivative structure is too low, sensitization will be insufficient. If the number is too high, the miscibility with photosensitive resins, especially with photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive organopolysiloxanes, will decrease.Therefore, it is preferable to have this group present at 0.2 to 50 of the total number of organic groups R4 Q in each molecule. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an organopolysiloxane photosensitizer wherein all 4 groups are methyl groups. The resulting methyl containing photosensitizers are particularly useful in the methyl silicone photocurable resins delineated below. A particularly useful embodiment of the present invention is the fluid organopolysiloxane photosensitizers, illustrated b the examples disclosed be low and encompassed by the general formulaR24SiO R24SiO x R4SiO y R4QSiO zSiR34. Herein R4 and Q are as delineated above, preferably CH andEMI9.1 respectively, and x, y and z have average values such that their sum is less than 1000 and z is at least 1.The values of x and v can both be zero however the value of X is typically greater than zero. The organopolysiloxane photosensitizers of this invention can be prepared by two general methods, both comprising a hydrosilylation reaction between .an alkenyloxvbenzophenone reactant and a reactant bearing at least one siliconbonded hydrogen atom, and both comprisinq an aspect of this invention. Other methods of preparation may also be suitable. In these two general methods of preparation the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant has the formula wherein R1 andEMI9.2 ral and preferred groups denoted above and m and n denote the same general and preferred integers noted above. These groups and integers are carried, unchanged in these two general methods, from the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant into the organopolysiloxane photosensitizer. The R5 group of the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant is an aliphatically unsaturated monovalent hvdrocarbon group having the same number of carbon atoms, i.. 2 in 3n, ar the R3 group denoted above and becomes said R group after the hydrosilylation reaction with the silicon bonded hydrogen atom. Examples of suitable groups include CH CH2, CH2CH CH2,EMI10.1 and CH2CH CHCH3.Of course, it is to be understood that whereas a given R5 group provides an R3 group having the same number of carbon atoms after the hydrosilylation reaction, the structure of the resulting R3 group can vary.For example, an R5 group having the structure CH2CH CH2 group can provided an R group having the structure CH2CH2CH2 or CH2CHCH3, depending on the mode of addition of the reacting silicon atom and the reacting hydrogen atom of the reactant bearing at least one silicon bonded hydrogen atom. Examples of alkenyloxybenzophenone derivatives are o vinyloxybenzophenone, p vinyloxybenzophenone, o allyloxybenzophenone, p allyloxybenzophenone, 2 allyloxy 4 methoxybenzophenone, 4,4 diallyloxy benzophenone, 3,5 dichloro 4 allyloxybenzophenone, 2 allyloxy 5 methylbenzophenone, o methallyloxybenzophenone, p methallyloxybenzophenone, 2 methallyloxy4 methoxybenzophenone, 4,4 dimethallyloxybenzophenone, 3 ,5 dichloro 4 methal ly oxybenzophenone, 2 methallyloxy 5 methylbenzophenone, o crotyloxybenzophenone, p crotyloxybenzophenone, 2 crotyloxy 4 methoxybenzophenone, 4,4 dicrotyloxybenzophenone, 3,5 dichloro 4 crotyloxybenzophenone, and 2 crotyloxy 5 methylbenzophenone. The alkenyloxybenzophenone derivative to be used in this synthesis can be synthesized by a conventionally known ether linkage formation reaction between readily available substituted or unsubstituted hydroxybenzophenone and an alkenyl halide. In other words, it can be obtained by a reaction between the suhstituted or unsubstituted hydroxybenzophenone and an alkenyl halide by use of a solvent such as ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, dimethoxy ethane, dimethylsulfoxide, or dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as sodium amide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium oxide, silver oxide, or sodium hydride. If necessary, a catalyst such as an iodide, for exar. ,le, potassium iodide, can be added.Examples of specific hvdroxvbenzophenone derivatives are o hydroxvbenzophenone, p hvdroxybenzophenone, 2 hydroxy 4 methoxvbenzo phenone, 4,4 dihydroxybenzophenone, 3,5 dichloro 4hydroxybenzophenone, and 2 hydroxy S methylbenzophenone. Examples of alkenyl halides are vinyl chloride, allyl chloride, allyl bromide, methallyl chloride, and crotyl chloride. In a first of said two general methods for preparing the organopolysiloxane photosensitizers of this invention the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant is reacted with an organohydrogenpolysiloxane reactant bearing at least one silicon bonded hydrogen atom to provide the organopoZysiloxane photosensitizers of this invention. The organohvdrogenpolysiloxane reactant used in the hydrosilylation reaction can be straight chained, branched chained, cyclic or network. The degree of polvmerization is greater than 2 and can go as high as the maximum possible degree of polymerization which can take place without destroying the hyarogen silicon bonds.For the reasons noted above for the organopolysiloxane photosensitizers of this invention, however, the degree of polymerization of the organohydrogenpolysiloxane reactant is likewise preferably less than 1000. The organohydrogenpolysiloxane reactant is preferably composed of siloxane units having the formulaR4CHdSiO 4 c d 2 wherein R4, c, d, and c d having the same genera I and preferred meanings as noted above with the requirement that at least one of the siloxane units bears a silicon bonded hydrogen atom. A preferred organohydrogenpolysiloxane to be used in this first method of photosensitizer preparation has the formula RJSiOXPzSiO x R R4HSiO SiR34 wherein x and w denote integers whose sum has a value of less than 1000. After the hydrosilylation reaction with the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant, this preferred organohydrogenpolysiloxane will give rise to the preferred organopolysiloxane photosensitizer noted above and having the formula R34SiO R24SiO x R4HSiO y R4QSiO zSiR34 wherein the sum of y z has a value equal to the value of w. To obtain the methyl containina organopolysiloxane photosensitizers that are particularly useful in methyl silicone photocurable resins referred to above and delineated below, all R groups in the organohydrogenpolysiloxane reactant are methyl groups. Additionally, the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant preferably has the formulaEMI12.1 As noted ahove, x can have a value of zero however, it is tvpicall greater than zero in the organohydrogenpoly siloxane reactant. Also, as noted above, v can have a value of zero, a condition resulting from the complete reaction of silicon bonded hydrogen atoms with alkenyloxybenzophenone, and the value of w then equals the value of z. In a second of said two general methods for preparing the organopolysiloxane photosensitizers of this invention an alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant is first reacted, by a hydrosilylation react ion, with a silane which contains at least one silicon bonded hydrogen atom and at least one silicon bonded hydrolyzable group or with a siloxane bearing at least two siloxane units and at least one silicon bonded hydrogen atom. The resulting reaction product, herein designated as the adduct, is thereafter pol, merized with itself or with another silane bearing at least one silicon bonded hydrolyzable group or with another siloxane. Said another silane and said another siloxane are free of silicon bonded benzophenonecontaining groups. In this second method the alkenyloxvbenzophenone reactant is the same as the general and preferred structures described in the first method, above. The silane reactant containing hydrogen atoms bonded to silicon atoms for the addition reaction with the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant in said second method preferably has the formula Re4HSiZ3 e The R4 groups in this formula are the same as noted above. Z denotes a hydrolyzable group such as a halogen atom, preferably a chlorine atom or an alkoxy group such as a methoxy group or an ethoxy group, or an acyloxy group such as an acetoxy group or a propionoxy group. The value of e is 0, 1 or 2, thereby providing silanes such as HSiZ3 such as trichlorosilane or trimethoxysilane, R4HSiZ, such as methyldichlorosilane or methyldimethoxysilane or methyldiacetoxysilane, and R24HSiZ such as dimethylchlorosilane.The adduct resulting from the hydrosilylation reaction between the alkenyloxybenzohenone reactant and the preferred silane reactant has the formula Re QSiZ3 e wherein R4, Q, Z and e are as described above. Examples of suitable silane adducts include, but are not limited to, QSiZ3 such asQSiCl3 or OSi OCH3 3, CH3 QSiZ2 such as CH3 QSiC12 or 0 CH3 QSi OCH3 2 or CH3 QSi OCCH3 2 and CH3 2QSiZ such as CH3 2QSiCl wherein Q is most preferably theEMI14.1 The siloxane reactant containing at least two siloxane units and at least one slicon bonded hydrogen atom for the hydrosilylation reaction with the alkenyloxybenzophenone reactant in said second method can be the organo hydrogenpolysiloxane reactant denoted above in the first method of this invention.As noted above, this preferred organohydrogenpolysiloxane can be straight chained, branched chained, cyclic or network in structure. The adduct resulting from a hydrosilylation reaction between the alkyloxybenzophenone reactant and this organohydrogenpolysiloxane reactant is, of course, the organopolysilxoane photosensitizer that is produced by the above described first method of preparation however, in th second method of preparation said adduct is further reacted by a siloxane polymerization reaction, with another silane or another siloxane, both free of silicon bonded Q groups, to produce new organopolysiloxane photosensitizers of this invention.In this second method of preparation the organchycrogenpoln siloxane reactant is preferably cyclic in structure such as CH3HSiO 4, i.e. tetramethyl tetrahydrocyclo tetrasiloxane, or CH3HSiO 3 i.e. trimethyl trihydrocyclotrisiloxane, or larger cyclics or mixtures thereof. In this second method the siloxane reactant containinq at least two siloxane units and at least one silicon honded hydrogen atom can also be an orqanohydrogenpolysiloxane further containing silicon bonded hydroxyl groups or silicon bonded hydrolvzable groups which are convertible to siliconbonded hydroxyl groups. These hydrolyzable groups are the same as the Z groups denoted above. Examples of organohydrogenpolysiloxane reactants containing hydrolyzable groups or hydroxyl groups include hydroxyl endblocked organohydrogenpolysiloxane such as HO CH3 2SiO x CH3 H SiO wH or methoxy endblocked organohydrogenpolysiloxanes such as CH3O 2 CH3 SiO CH3 2 SiO x CH3 H SiO wSi CH3 OCH3 2 wherein x and w are as noted above. For hydrosilylation addition reactions in either method of this invention between alkenyloxyhenzophenone derivatives and silanes or siloxanes containing hydrogen atoms bonded directly to silicon atoms, catalysts to be used are benzovl peroxide, di t butyl peroxide or other peroxides platinum, palladium, rhodium, nickel, cobalt or other metals in powdered form or in complexes. Platinum sponge, platinum black, chloroplatinic acid, the reaction prdouct of chloroplatinic acid and alcohol, a complex of chloroplatinic acid and vinyl siloxane and other platinum catalysts are preferably used. This addition reaction is preferably carried out so that the alkenyloxybenzophenone derivative is reacted at 1 mole z or less with respect to the hydroaer atoms bonded to the silicon atoms.This addt1on reaction can he carried out in the absence or presence of a solvent. Typically, an alkenyloxybenzophenone derivative is first heated and melted, then mixed with a silane or siloxane containing hydrogen atoms bonded to silicon atoms. While these are being vigorously mixed, a catalyst is added to promote the reaction. The addition reaction is completed in a homogeneous system. However, it is preferable to add a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene to give a homogeneous starting system for the reaction. The adduct that is obtained in the first step of the second method of this invention is subsequently further reacted, in a siloxane polymerization reaction, with itself or with another silane bearing at least one silicon bonded hydrolyzable group or with another siloxane. Said siloxane polymerization reaction can be a hydrolysis and siloxane condensation reaction and or a siloxane eauilibration reaction in the well known manner.The hydrolysis and condensation can be carried out by conventionally known methods if hydrolyzable groups are present. If hvdrolyzable groups are not present, the equilibrium polymerization can be carried out in the presence of a conventionally known basic or acidic catalyst. Said other silanes or other siloxanes are those which do not contain groups possessing the benzophenone derivative structure. Examples are organotrichlorosilane, diorganodi chlorosilane, triorganochlorosilane, organotrialkoxysilane, diorganodialkoxysilane, triorganoalkoxysilane, organotriacetoxysilane, diorganodiacetoxysilane, triorganoacetoxysilane, diorgano methyl ethyl ketoxime silane, tetraorganodialkoxvdi siloxane, pentaorganotriaikoxy trisiloxane, triorganopenta alkoxytrisiloxane, a, w cydro.ydiorganosIloxane oligomer, octaorganocyclote trasilox ne and hexaorganodisiloxane. The photopolymerization sensitizers of the present invention can be applied to various photosensitive resins. However, their characteristics are best exhibited when they are applied specifically to photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive organopolysiloxanes. In other words, the sensitizers widely used conventionally and containing benzophenone,Michler s ketone and benzoin as major ingredients have at most 2 miscibility with photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive orqanopolvsiloxanes. However, the sensitizers of the present invention are miscible in much larcer amounts it the photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive organopolysiloxanes. In a mixed state with photosensitive silicone resins or photosensitive organopolysiloxanes, they do not separate out or form deposits even after long term storage.They do not have the problems of conventional sensitizers such as benzophenone and Michler s ketone, in which the sensitizers crystallize out after radiation hardening.They can be used at high concentrations. A high sensitization effect can be expected. The miscibilities of the photopolymerization sensitizers of the present invention will be good if the sensitizers are selected so that they have molecular structures or contain organic groups identical or similar to the molecular structures or organic groups of photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive organopolvsiloxanes. For example, if a photosensitive organopoly siloxane has a linear structure, is liquid and contains methyl groups as the major organic groups, it is preferable to select a photopolymerization sensitizer Ot the present invention which also has a linear or cyclic structure, is liquid and contains methyl groups as the major organic groups, other than those groups possessing the benzophenone derivative structure. The sensitizers of the present invention can be applied to those photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive orqanopolysiloxanes known to date, such a organopolysiloxanes containing acryloxy groups JapanesePatent Sho 53 1978 2911, Japanese Patent Sho 53 1978 36515, and Japanese Patent Sho S5 1980 47 O , compositions of organopolysiloxanes having SiH bonds and organopolysiloxanes containing unsaturated groups such as vinyl groups Japanese Patent Sho 52 1977 40334 , and compositions of organopolysiloxanes having mercapto groups and organopolysiloxanes containing unsaturated groups such as vinyl groups Japanese Patent Sho 54 1979 43017 . The sensitizers of the present invention are highly miscible with all of the photosensitive silicone resins and photosensitive organopolysiloxanes. They can be blended in large amounts. They show a high sensitizing action. In the present invention, the term phdtosensitization refers to sensitization by ultraviolet rays, electrons and other high energy rays. The following examples are disclosed to further illustrate, and to teach how to practice, the present invention. These examples shall not limit the present invention as delineated by the appended claims. All parts and percentages refer to parts by weight and percentage by weight, unless otherwise indicated. Me denotes the methyl group. Viscosities are the values at 25 C.
