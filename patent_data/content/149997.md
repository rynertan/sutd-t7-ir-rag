# IMPROVED NICOTINE DISPENSING DEVICE AND METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF

## Abstract
An improved nicotine dispensing device for non pyrolytic use which is adapted to release nicotine bearing vapors into air drawn through the device. The device comprises one or more nicotine bearing sections, one or more insulating sections which are linearly aligned with nicotine bearing sections and a fluid impermeable housing. The housing retains the nicotine bearing and insulating sections. This invention also includes a method for the preparation of an improved nicotine dispensing device. The method includes the steps of preparing one or more fluid retaining sections and one or more insulating sections. The fluid retaining sections and insulating sections are linearly arranged and wrapped with a fluid impermeable housing material. A nicotine containing material is then injected into, or incorporated within, the fluid retaining sections.
