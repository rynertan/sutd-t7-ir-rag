# Lowering device and method.

## Abstract
A lowering device for lowering a person or other load comprises a line 6 for lowering the load and a support structure 10 through which the line 6 runs during lowering. In some modes of operation a free end of the line 6 is secured to a fixed point, and the support structure 10 is secured to the person and travels with the person down the line. In other modes the support structure 10 is secured to a fixed point, and the load is secured to a free end of the line 6 and is lowered downwardly away from the support structure. Pivotably mounted on the support structure 10 is a transverse guide member 46 carrying fixed guide ele ments 47 and 48 at either end thereof and rotatable guide element 49 at the centre thereof. The line 6 passes around the guide elements 47 and 48 and under the effect of load tension the transverse member 46 pivots to bring guide elements 47 and 48 into a pinching effect with guide elements 42 and 44 , or 41 and 45 , which are fixed on the support structure. Variation of speed of the rope through the support structure 10 is achieved by rotating an external lever 70 coupled to the transverse member 46 . The rope 6 may follow various routes through the support structure 10 , entering and exiting at selected openings 56, 57 and 59 .
