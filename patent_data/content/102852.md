# PRESS BRAKE GAUGING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A gauge bar assembly is provided with T nut, quick action hand clamp brackets to linear bearing blocks of a gauge drive mechanism. Gauge mounting brackets are supported and guided on upstanding tubes in the quick action clamp brackets. Powered vertical drive for the mount ing brackets is provided. A gauge bar having unusually high resistance to bending, due to a unique Y shaped cross section, is clamped to the gauge mounting brackets. Flip fingers with manually adjustable adjustment wedges, and spring take up means, are provided for precise horizontal adjustment of gauging fingers toward and away from press brake tooling.
