# Low viscosity water in oil microemulsions.

## Abstract
A water in oil microemulsion comprises a an oil phase b an aqueous phase c at least one emulsifier, and d at least one aliphatic diol of the formula CHEM where R and R sec are independently hydrogen or C1 C18 aliphatic groups, each R min is independently hydrogen or a C1 C20 aliphatic group, n is an integer of 1 4, with the provisos that the number of carbon atoms in R is different than the number of carbon atoms in R sec , and the total number of carbon atoms in 1 is from 5 to about 25. The aliphatic diol 1 is preferably 2 ethyl 1, 3 hexanediol. The microemulsions are useful as fire resistant hydraulic fluids.
