# Semiconductor device using holes as charge carriers.

## Abstract
Holes are the charge carriers along a conduction channel in an epitaxial layer 28 of semiconductor material eg GaSb formed on a supporting layer 26 of semiconductor material eg AlSb which has a lower valance band energy than that of the material of the epitaxial layer. The material of the epitaxial layer 28 has a lattice spacing when unstrained which is different from the lattice spacing of the material of the supporting layer 26 which is rigid enough to strain the lattice of the material of the epitaxial layer. The material of the epitaxial layer is such that mobile holes are provided in its conduction channel due to the strain put on its lattice by the supporting layer. A further layer 20 of semiconductor material eg AlSb contiguous with the epitaxial layer 28 is doped to induce the conduction channel in the epitaxial layer and to provide modulation doping.

## Description
This invention relates to a semiconductor device such as a field effect transistor FET , which has a strained epitaxial layer for increased hole mobility therein. In the construction of semiconductor circuits, both n type devices and p type devices are employed, the former utilising electrons as the charge carriers while the latter utilises holes as the charge carriers. Complementary circuitry is advantageously employed in many situations, as in push pull operations, or in circuitry employing n p n and p n p transistors formed as discrete components or formed within the chip of an integrated circuit. Today, a major interest is the construction of such circuits by large arrays of transistor devices within a single integrated circuit chip. A particular advantage of complementary circuitry and large scale arrays is the fact that the p type and the n type devices conduct alternately, thereby consuming less power so as to achieve high density circuits. Semiconductor devices constructed from silicon with suitable doping to provide n type and p type regions have been successfully employed in the construction of arrays of complementary circuits. An important factor in the success of the silicon is the presence of good mobility for both holes and electrons. The mobilities are sufficiently comparable in value so as to provide similar circuit parameters for devices employing the electron conduction and for devices employing the hole conduction. The use of silicon is disadvantageous in that the frequency response of devices constructed of silicon is not as high as would be desired in many applications. A higher frequency response can be obtained by use of semiconducting compounds of elements from groups III and V of the periodic table. Circuits constructed of such material do have the desired high frequency response. However, a problem arises in the use of group III V semiconductor material in that the values of mobility for holes and electrons differ greatly. Essentially, only the electrons can be utilised as charge carriers. Therefore, complementary circuitry employing both p type and n type devices cannot be constructed as is done in the case of silicon. The problem is particularly acute in the case of construction of field effect transistors of the group III V compounds because such FET s are regularly used in a wide variety of electronic circuits. The invention seeks to overcome the foregoing problem. A semiconductor device which employs holes as charge carriers along a conduction channel in an epitaxial layer of semiconductor material formed on a supporting layer of semiconductor material is characterised, according to the invention, by the material of the epitaxial layer having a higher valance band energy than that of the material of the supporting layer, by the material of the epitaxial layer having a lattice spacing when unstrained which is different from the lattice spacing of the material of the supporting layer, by the epitaxial layer being sufficiently thin and the supporting layer being sufficiently thick that the supporting layer is rigid enough to strain the lattice of the material of the epitaxial layer and by the material of the epitaxial layer being such that mobile holes are provided in its conduction band due to the strain put on its lattice by the supporting layer. In the case of group III V semiconductor compounds, such a straining of the material of the epitaxial layer gives rise to an elongation in two dimensions along the surface of the rigid thick layer and a compressive stress in a direction normal to the surface. This results in a shifting of the energy levels removing the degeneracy of heavy and light holes and making the lattice support charge carriers with substantial mobility. As a further feature in the construction of semiconductor devices, particularly FET s, an additional layer of material is placed upon the strained layer, the additional layer serving as a component of the gate structure of an FET and as an energy confining layer so that the thin, strained layer is quantised. In addition, the further layer is selectively doped with impurities. The contiguous locations of the further doped layer and the strained layer permit the transfer of holes from the further layer to penetrate the strained layer to provide for an effect known as modulation doping wherein the hole mobility is enhanced without the infusion of impurities in the strained layer. Thereby, the virtue of the shifting of the hole energy levels and the modulation doping a p type FET can be constructed with a hole mobility substantially equal to that of the electron mobility in a conventional n type FET. This permits the construction of complementary FET circuitry from group III V semiconductor material. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 represents a field effect transistor 10 embodying the invention. The transister 10 has a source terminal comprising a source region 12 with a metal source electrode 14 appended thereto, a drain terminal comprising a drain region 16 with a metal drain electrode 18 appended thereto, and a gate terminal comprising a gate layer 20 with a metal gate electrode 22 deposited thereon. The transistor 10 further comprises a substrate 24, a relatively thick layer 26 supported by the substrate 24, and a relatively thin layer 28 disposed between and contiguous with the thick layer 26 and the gate layer 20. The substrate 24, the layers 26 and 28, and the gate 20 are all constructed of semiconductor compounds of group III and group V elements of the periodic table. Typical group III elements include aluminium, indium, and gallium. Typical group V elements include phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the semiconductor compounds employed are, as shown in FIG.1, gallium antimonide, and aluminium antimonide. The substrate 24 and the thin layer 28 are formed of high resistivity gallium antimonide, while the thick layer 26 and the gate layer 20 are formed of aluminum antimonide. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the aluminum antimonide is replaced with gallium aluminum antimonide. Further, the substrate GaSb, whose purpose is to initiate epitaxy, can be replaced by other materials such as widely available GaAs and ImP, or AlSb itself. In the case of AlSb, the layer 26 would not be used. Although this disclosure emphasises Group III V compounds, the invention is applicable to other suitable semiconductor materials such as Group IV compounds and Group II IV compounds. With reference also to FIGS. 2,3, and 4, the thick layer 26 is identified as layer B while the thin layer 28 is identified as layer A . In the normal unstrained condition of the materials of the A and B layers, the crystalline lattice structure of layer A has a smaller spacing between lattice points than does the lattice of layer B. The layer A is grown epitaxially upon layer B. Such epitaxial growth is performed, for example, by molecular beam epitaxy at a temperature of approximately 600 C. During the epitaxial growth, layer A develops with a lattice spacing equal to that of the B lattice spacing in the two dimensional layer plane as is demonstrated in FIG.2. Layer B is sufficiently thick and rigid so as to stretch the material of the layer A. This stretching results in a compression of the lattice of layer A in the direction perpendicular to the plane along the surface at the interface between layers A and B. It is noted that, with epitaxial growth, if the epitaxial layer were to be grown sufficiently thick, then the stresses generated would eventually be relaxed and the crystalline structure would gain the normal state and lattice spacing, thereby destroying the rigid relationship. However, it is arranged that the thickness of the A layer is well below such upper limit on epitaxy so that the state of strain is retained. Such state of strain is retained independently of the presence of the gate layer 20. While the gate layer 20 is composed of the same material as is layer B, and therefore assists in the maintenance of the strained condition of layer A, its primary function is the provision of modulation doping for enhanced mobility of holes in a conduction channel 30 within the layer A between the source region 12 and the drain region 16. The substrate 24 has a conventional thickness, typically 5 mils 0.127mm as is customarily employed in the construction of such semiconductor devices to provide a stable support for the active components of the device. The relatively thick layer 26 layer B has a thickness of approximately 500 nm. The relatively thin layer 28 layer B has a thickness of 10 40 nm. The gate layer 20 has a thickness in the range of 10 100 nm, the relatively large range thickness being provided to accommodate differing operating voltage levels for the gate voltage V The thickness for layer A of approximately 10 nm is of the order of a few electron wavelengths with reference to the well known quantum mechanics regime of semiconductor structures. With respect to energy levels of the charge carriers, particularly the holes, the aforementioned two dimensional strain introduces a stress normal to the interface between the layers 26 and 28 which offsets the energy levels of the holes as depicted in FIG.3. On the left side of the FIG.3, there is shown the degenerate relationship of light holes and heavy holes in the unstrained condition of the gallium antimonide of the A layer. On the right side of FIG.3, there is shown the corresponding situation in the strained gallium antimonide wherein the degeneracy has been removed, and the light holes have been elevated to a higher energy level than that of the heavy holes. This shift in energy level makes the light holes level the ground state which is occupied with holes providing a hole mobility which is sufficiently close to the electron mobility in the well known construction of n type FET s so as to permit the construction of complementary circuits employing n type and p type FET s. The n type FET is constructed in accordance with conventional technology, while the p type FET embodies the invention and is constructed as disclosed herein. The effect on the energy levels is further illustrated in FIG. 4 wherein on the left side there is portrayed the energy gap in the material of the layer B and in the material of the A layer when it is in the unstrained condition. In FIG.4, the energy is indicated by E, the gap is indicated by g, and the materials of the respective layers A and B by A and B. The energy gap is the difference between the conduction band edge and the valence band edge, the conduction being indicated by the letter C and the valence being indicated by the letter V . In the centre of FIG.4, the effect of the strain is shown. The light and heavy holes are identified, respectively, by l and h . The degenerate condition shown on the left side of FIG.4, wherein both forms of holes occupy the same energy band, is changed under the strained condition wherein the light holes and the heavy holes occupy different energy levels. The energy levels are changed further, as shown on the right side of FIG.4, by the effect of the aforementioned energy quantisation and modulation doping. The impurities in the gate layer 20, release holes to the thin layer 28. But because the impurities are not present in the thin layer 28, the holes in layer 28 have high mobility and conductivity. The impurities may be placed in the gate layer 20 during epitaxial growth prior to the deposition of the metal gate electrode 22. In the presence of both the modulation doping and the application of a gate voltage between the gate and the source terminals, a hole conduction channel is established within the layer 20 between the source region 12 and the drain region 16. The entire structure of the device of Figure 1 can be produced by molecular beam epitaxy or other suitable processes. Both the thick layer 26 and the thin layer 28 are undoped. Only the layer 20 is doped as mentioned above. The source region 12 and the drain region 16 are developed within the layer 28 by diffusion or by ionic implantation of impurities to produce the p state in each of these regions. That the source and drain regions may penetrate the layer 26 is immaterial, because this layer is undoped, has a high resistivity and so does not conduct current. The electrodes 14, 18 and 22 can be applied by conventional steps of metallisation. Thus, the device can be produced using existing technology processes. The transistor 10 can be used in conventional electric circuits the substrate 24 may be grounded if desired, and a drain voltage applied between the drain electrode 18 and the source electrode 14. A gate voltage is applied between the gate electrode 22 and the source electrode 14 or the drain electrode 16. Thus, the p type transistor 10 can be connected in electric circuitry in a manner corresponding to that employed with conventional n type FET s. The operation of the semiconductor device of the invention will now be compared with that of other semiconductor devices. In ordinary semiconductors, particularly III V compounds, heavy holes have a large effective mass and a low mobility. Although light holes are present, electrical transport in p type semiconductors is dominated by heavy holes which have a large density of states in bulk material and provide the ground state in heterostructures when energy quantisation lifts a degeneracy at the valence band maximum. For this reason, fast transport devices, such as field effect transistors invariably deal with electrons and n type materials. In the semiconductor device described herein, there is a change in the roles played by the heavy holes and the light holes. This is accomplished by making the light hole dominant in population with the introduction of strain and stress. A stress normal to the interface between the layers 26 and 28 is accomplished by use of the lattice mismatch which is inherent in epitaxial heterostructures. Fast p type devices can be realised by the light holes with their relatively small mass and relatively high mobility. These devices, while being important in their own right, can also be integrated with ordinary n type electron devices for complementary circuits for logic and other applications. The higher energy states available for light holes in the thin layer 28 can be occupied when holes are introduced by either ordinary doping or by modulation doping with p type dopants. To take full advantage of carrier mobility enhancement by modulation doping, the holes are confined by a potential well to become two dimensional in nature. Quantisation of the energy levels by the modulation doping lowers the energies of all states with their magnitudes increasing with increasing confinement and decreasing mass. The relative positions of the light and heavy holes depend in detail on the actual shape of the well. In a square well obtained by sandwiching the layer A between two layers B, accomplished by employing the same material in both the thick layer 26 and the gate layer 20, the potential is defined by the thickness of layer A and the valence band discontinuities which are now different for the light and heavy holes. In a simple heterojunction, the potential is defined by the discontinuities and the space charge. It should be noted that the electron states are also quantised, but this is not determinative of the hole energy levels of concern herein. Under proper conditions, the ground states of light holes corresponding to a quantisation index n O remains the ground state of the system. As shown hereinabove, field effect devices can then be readily produced by attaching source, drain and gate electrodes. The fundamental requirement for operation of the structure of the invention is that there be a difference in the valence band energy, Ev, of the two materials. The Ev of the layer A is higher than the Ev of the layer B. Furthermore, the lattice spacing in the layer B is greater than that in the layer A. These conditions are met in GaSb AlSb system wherein the reversal of the light and the heavy holes state occur. This condition is also met in the GaAs GaAlAs system, although here the strain effect is relatively small. In electric circuitry including a p type transistor of the invention in combination with a conventional n type transistor of a group III V compound, such transistors may be fabricated as discrete components or may be constructed in an integrated circuit on a common substrate. In view of the fact that the construction steps utilised in fabricating the semiconductor structure of the invention are similar to those utilised in the construction of other semiconductor devices, it is apparent that by use of multiple epitaxial processes and diffusion and ion implantation together with masking and photolithography, it is possible to construct an array of circuit elements including both p and n type devices, particularly FET s with the n type FET s being constructed in accordance with present day technology and the p type FET s being constructed in accordance with the foregoing teachings.
