# Transistor switching circuit.

## Abstract
A driving circuit for a power transistor switch in which a feedback transformer 32 between the collector path of the power transistor 21 and that of the driver transistor 22 is used to provide a current drive to the power transistor that is proportional to the load current, and in which a reverse current drive, also proportional to the load current is applied by way of a third winding 36 on the transformer to the emitterbase circuit of the power transistor 21 to decrease the switching off time of that transistor.
