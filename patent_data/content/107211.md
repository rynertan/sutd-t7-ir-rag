# POLYSILOXANES AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME

## Abstract
Polysiloxanes produced by polymerizing a monomeric si lane in the presence of an organo metallic polymerisation ca talyst, e.g. a metal carboxylate, and the use of the polysilox anes to react with alkylene alkyl acrylate copolymers to pro duce silane modified, water curable polymers. The polysiloxanes have the general formula
