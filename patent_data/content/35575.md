# BLOOD SERUM SEPARATING AGENT.

## Abstract
A thixotropic blood serum separating agent for separat ing blood into a blood serum portion and a coagulating por tion. This agent mainly contains Î± olefin maleic acid diester copolymer having a viscosity of 10,000 to 80,000 CP 25 C for preventing phase separation, reduction in fluidity, and forma tion of volatile materials with the lapse of time, and further contains agents for adjusting viscosity and specific gravity of 1.035 to 1.055. This is suited to be retained in an evacuated bloood collecting tube for use as a blood serum separating tube.
