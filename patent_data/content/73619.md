## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREVENTING FROM DISCOLORING AND FADING OF DYE IMAGE The present invention relates to a process for preventing from discoloring and fading a dye image in a color image forming material or printed matter. Generally, an image made of dye or dyestuff, in printed matter such as a color print or a poster, is observed or displayed under conditions of strong illumination by sunlight or by the light of an illuminator. If this illumination lasts many hours, the image is discolored or faded by the illuminating light giving poor color balance or color reproductivity. However, even with those not always being illuminated by the light but preserved for most of the time in the dark such as a color movie film, a color slide, a color negative film, a color print pasted in an album, it is known that image discoloration and fading occur on storage. The former phenomenon is called light discoloration and fading while the latter is called dark discoloration and fading. With the object of preventing an image from discoloring and fading, there have been proposed processes such as those in which, for example, a dye or dyestuff having improved resistance to discoloration and fading by having a different chemical structure is used, or in which a discoloration and fading preventive agent, or a coloring and fading preventive bath, is used with a conventional type of dye or dyestuff. Besides these, many processes are known in which an ultra violet ray absorbant is added in the neighborhood of the dye or dyestuff because light discoloration and fading are basically caused by the highly energized ultra violet ray of normal light, or a type of oxidation inhibitor is used because such discoloration and fading are governed by an oxidizing atmosphere, examples of these are organic compounds having a phenolic hydroxyl group and derivatives thereof.For improving said dark discoloration and fading, there have been proposed processes which use a stabilizing bath containing a hydantoin compound, a carbohydrazide compound, polymethylol compound, an organic bronzing preventive or the like to serve as a fading preventive, in which an ester phosphite compound, a benzotriazole derivative or the like is added to a photographic emulsion layer, or in which unreacted coupler is eliminated. With these conventional processes for improving said discoloration and fading it is rather difficult to show that satisfactory effects are always obtained, further, when using an auxiliary additive such as a discoloration and fading preventive agent or a discoloration and fading preventive bath, the difficulties involving manufacture and processing are increased, also they tend to have a bad physical or photographic influence on the image surface that results, for example it can be a sticky, a rough or a soiled image surface, so that there is still considerable room for improvement at the present time. As the result of thorough studies, we have found, according to the present invention, a process for preventing from discoloring and or fading a dye image formed in color image forming material or of a dye image formed in a printed matter, the improvement comprising forming a color developable leuco dye which develops a color by light or heat in said color image forming material or in said printed matter. In other words, according to the present invention, a color compensation process is provided in which the apparent color density of the image may be constantly maintained over a long period of time by the material already containing a compound which gradually develops color on being exposed to light or heat, which causes discoloring and fading of said color image formed by a conventional type of dye or dyestuff.Also, in the case of light discoloration and fading, it is not only possible to maintain the apparent density constant for a long period of time by using a compound which develops color gradually on being exposed at least to light, in a layer on the light illuminated side or the light reflected side of the layer s containing the usual dyes or dyestuffs, but also it is possible to prevent normal types of dyes or dyestuffs from discoloring and fading because said compound can act as a light filter for the dye or dyestuff. In the invention, the active substance is a leuco dye. In broad sense, a leuco dye is a generic name for an organic dye capable of changing its color tone on oxidation reduction or vice verso, those of the reduction type are colorless or light colored, while those of the oxidation type are deep colored.The dyes of the reduction type are so called leuco dyes as opposed to the normal oxidation type of dyes.In the invention, however, it is not always necessary that said dye forming reaction should be reversible.For image forming materials using a light or heat colordevelopable leuco dye, as described in, for example,Japanese Patent Applications Nos 28530 1980 and 121427 1980, fading prevention processes as the process of this invention are not known. In order to effectively prevent a normal dye or dyestuff from discoloring and fading by making use of a light or heat developable leuco dye, it is preferable for the light or heat color developable leuco dye to be present imagewise in the same way as the normal dye or dyestuff is present, or to be formed imagewise. For example, when the leuco dye is used in a color image forming material such as a photographic material, and in order to make said light and heatcolor developable leuco dyes form imagewise according to the light information, it is necessary that at least three types of substances should co exist, i.e. a coupler that is a compound forming a leuco dye, a developer and a compound having a selective oxidation function in relation to the light information. Also, for example, when a leuco dye is used in printed matter, it is possible to produce an image in which the yellow, magenta, cyan and black i.e.a black dye components are each multiprinted imagewise, and said image can be prevented from discoloring and fading by multiprinting imagewise on any layer a leuco dye in which a color is developed by light or heat, or the three substances, that is, a coupler forming said leuco dye, a developer and an oxidizer. In the invention, the leuco dyes having a fading preventive function may be any leuco dye which develops color by light or heat, and inter alia, in particular a developer having a sulfonamide group and a coupler therefor. The developers having a sulfonamide group which can be used in the invention include those having the formula Au Co NH SO2 Y wherein Au represents an auxochrome i.e. an electron emitting donating group such as a group having a lone electron pair or an aliphatic group which makes the electron mobility easier by interaction with It electron of a chromophore i.e. an atomic group having an unsaturated coupling , in general said auxochrome has a bathochromic effect and a hyperchromic effect.Examples thereof are R, OR, NRR and a halogen, wherein R and R independently represent H or an alkyl group having one to eight carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group and a propyl group, or a substituted alkyl group such as p hydroxyethyl group, p methoxyethyl group and a p methylsulfonamidoethyl group, further in the case of RRR , R and R may together form with the nitrogen atom a nitrogencontaining saturated hetero ring such as a morpholinyl group, piperidyl group, 3 hydroxy piperidyl group, piperazyl group, pyrolidyl group, imidazolidyl group or piperazolidyl group. Co represents a group having at least one conjugated double bond such as a butadienylene group, phenylene group, a substituted phenylene group and preferably phenylene group or a substituted phenylene group. Y represents a group by which said developer or said leuco dye is endowed with suitable properties, of, say, stability, diffusibility and dissolvability. Examples include a hydroxy group, or a salt thereof such as ONa, an alkyl group having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms such as a methyl group or a butyl group, an amino group such as N,N dimethylaminp group, or an aryl group such as a phenyl, tolyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, 4 chlorophenyl, alpha naphtyl or ss naphthyl group. Concrete examples of developers having a sulfonamide group which can be used in the invention are shown as follows EMI6.1 EMI7.1 EMI8.1 EMI9.1 EMI10.1 The above mentioned developers having a sulfonamide group can easily be synthesized from a primary amine compound and a sulfonyl halide compound. To serve as coupler in the present invention, any one of the well known types used in silver halide color photographic materials may be utilized. Thus, there can be used, as yellow couplers, for example, a benzoylacetoanilide compound as described in US PatentNo 2 875 057, a pivaloylacetoanilide compound as described in US Patent No 3 265 506 or A carbamoylacetoamide compound as described in Japanese unexamined patent publication No 154 631 79, as magenta couplers7 for example, a 5 pyrazolone compound as described inUS Patent No 2 600 788, a pyrazolotriazole compound as described in Belgian Patent No 792525, a pyrazolinobenzimidazole compound as described in US Patent No 3 061 432, an indazolone compound as described in BelgianPatent No 769116, a cyanoacetyl compound as described in US Patent No 2 338 677 or a thiazoline compound, and as cyan couplers, a phenol compound as described in US Patent No 2 801 171, a diacylaminophenol compound or a naphthol compound as described in US Patent No 2 474 293, for example. Besides the above, it is also possible to utilize a cycloactive methylene compound having at least one carbonyl group in the ring, such as an indanone compound, an indandione compound, a thionaphthenone compound, a cumaranone compound, a thioindoxyl compound, an isooxazolone compound, a pyrimidazolone compound an oxyindole compound or a homophthalimide compound. In addition thereto, it is also possible to utilize the so called active site substituted couplers in which one of the hydrogen atoms of the active sitemethylene group of the abovementioned coupler is substituted by another elimination group such as a halogen atom or an alkoxy, aryloxy, heteroyloxy, sulfonyloxy, acyloxy, acryl, thiocyano, alkylthio, arylthio, heteroylthio, sulfonamide, sulfonyloxy or arylazo. When a light or heat color developable leuco dye is synthesized in advance by making use of a developer having a sulfonamide group and a coupler and the leuco dye thus synthesized is used in discoloring and fading prevention, the process for synthesizing said dye described in Japanese Patent Application No 28530 1980 can be utilized. When a light or heat color developable leuco dye is synthesized in advance, said leuco dye being present in a photographic sensitive material and then formed imagewise, the dye should be able to co exist with a compound having an oxidation function which operates selectively in accordance with the light information. Examples of such compounds having a selective oxidation function p41 y halogenated hydrocarbons such as a tetrabromomethane or tribromophenylsulfone compound, a bis imidazole compound, a pyridine N oxide compound, an organic acid silver compound or silver halide. In the invention, it is advantageous to use a silver halide because it amplifies a light information very well.Oxidation is carried out by developing an exposed silver halide and thereby a developer having said sulfonamide group and a coupler are effectively converted into a leuco dye. When using said silver halide in the invention, it is also possible to use effectively a known cross oxidizer, for example an aminophenol compound, a phenylenediamine compound, a 3 pyrazolidone compound, an azine compound or a bipyridium compound and the like. Examples of these are given below EMI13.1 EMI14.1 Leuco dye formed from a developer having a sulfonamide group and a coupler creates a chromophore which develops color on exposure to light or heat such as ultraviolet rays, visible light or infrared rays.Other color developable leuco dyes which can be used are described in, for example, Research Disclosure vol 128, No 12838 and No 12839 and Ibid, vol 133,No 13313. Further, a leuco dye formed from a coupler having an elimination group such as an acetamide group, trichloroacetamide group, an imide group at the active site of a pyrazolone magenta coupler through a nitrogen atom and a p phenylene do gamine color developer such as 4 N ethyl N p hydroxyethylamino 2 methylaniline or 4 N, N diethylamino 2 methylaniline, which are frequently used in normal color developing processes, can also be one of the compounds capable of developing color with light or heat and said leuco dye can be used in the present invention.It will be appreciated that the speed at which the leuco dyes are converted by light or heat into the colored dyes, and the maximum absorption wavelength and the mole absorbance coefficient, for example, of the dyes thus formed depend inter alia on the size of the conjugated system, the nature of the chromophore, the nature of electron withdrawing group and electron donating group of the auxochrome the ionization and cyclization thereof, the degree of steric hindrance, hydrogen bonding or metallic complex formation in or between molecules caused by the presence of other substituents, and the dye medium. With reference to a silver halide color photosensitive material, there should be present a coupler for forming a light or heat color developable leuco dye and a developer containing said sulfonamide group, for example, besides the coupler for forming the normal dye image and the normal color developer. The coupler for forming the normal dye image and the coupler for forming a light or heat color developable leuco dye may be the same or different. The layer in which the leuco dye is formed may also be either the same or different from the layer in which the normal dye image is formed, in this case, the silver halide in the normal dye image forming layer may be used also for forming the leuco dye, or silver halide may be present in another layer for the leuco dye. The processes for including the developer ana coupler used in this invention are not significant and it is possible to use all known processes for normal silver halide photosensitive materials. Thus, for example, the coupler and the developer may be dissolved in a solvent of high boiling point to make fine oil drops and said drops are dispersed as described in US Patent No 2 322 027, an antidiffusion group and water soluble group may be coupled thereto and the dissolution and dispersion thereof is then carried out, as described in US Patent No 2 18 they may be incorporated as a component of a macromolecu lar compound, as described in US Patent No 2 397 864 they may be loaded onto a latex polymer, as described in Japanese Patent Publication Open to PublicInspection Nos 59942 1976 and 59943 1976, or they may bz dispersed mechanically by means of a colloid mill or the like On the other hand, when the developers and couplers used in this invention are supplied from a photographic processing liquid, it is preferable to introduce a suitable group for giving the respective compounds appropriate properties such as dissolvabilityt permeability, diffusibility and the like, in consideration of the dissolvability of the developers and couplers to be used to a processing liquid or the permeability, diffusibility and the like thereof to a silver halide color photosensitive material.

As is obvious from the above Table 2, in contrast with the case of Sample N having only MagentaCoupler 1 , in the case of Sample M of the invention containing Magenta Coupler 2 capable of forming a light color developable leuco dye, the magenta coupler thereof is prevented apparently from fading because in a color developing bath a magenta dye and a leuco dye are simultaneously formed by MagentaCoupler 1 for the former and by Magenta Coupler 2 and 4 N ethyl N p methylsulfonamide ethylamino 2 methyl aniline for the latter, and said leuco dye develops color gradually upon illumination by aXenon Arc light. The effects of the process of this invention can be enhanced when a color fading preventive such as 1,4 dioctyloxy 285 di t pentyl benzene is incorporated in the green sensitive emulsion layer of Sample M.
