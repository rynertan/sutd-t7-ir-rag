# Optical fiber connectors and methods of making.

## Abstract
In order to connect two optical fibers 26 26 , each of two plugs 40 40 each having a passageway 41 in which is received an optical fiber 26 are mounted in a connector body 42 . The plugs 40 are destined to be received in a sleeve 75 of a coupler 60 such that their longitudinal axes 38 are coaxial. Alignment of the passageways 41 , at least radially of the longitudinal axes 38 , is accomplished by locating for each plug 40 the intersection 90 of a radial line 88 which extends through the centroid of an opening of the passageway 41 with the periphery of the plug 40 . Each plug 40 is mounted in its connector body 42 such that the intersection 90 is aligned radially with a pin 43 extending from the connector body 42 . The connector bodies 42 are inserted into opposite ends of the coupler sleeve 75 to cause each pin 43 of each connector body 42 to be received in a slot 67 in the coupler 60 . The slots 67 are aligned so that when the connector bodies 42 are inserted into the coupler 60 , the plugs 40 are caused to be inserted into the sleeve 75 such that the centroids of the passageways 41 , and of the optical fibers 26 , are aligned, at least along a plane that originates at and extends radially from the longitudinal axes 38 .
