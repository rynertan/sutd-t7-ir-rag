It is well known that dyes having a S sulfato ethylsulfonyl group or so called vinylsulfone type reactive dyes are used for dyeing cellulose fiber materials. But, products dyed with orange to scarlet azo reactive dyes of this kind are not deep in color because of the poor build up property of the dyes, and also the dyed products are generally low in chlorine fastness, so that they often experience discoloration due to chlorine in city water. Dyes having a monochlorotriazinyl group are also known. Generally, however, these reactive dyes require high temperatures for dyeing and lack exhaustion dyeing ability. Accordingly, they are only used for printing. Besides, the products dyed with the dyes of this kind are low in acid stability. Thus, the dyes of this kind are not always satisfactory in practical use.For example, the following dyes are disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,223,470 EMI2.1 However, these dyes are not satisfactory in solubility, build up property, washing off property or the like. For the reasons described above, the inventors extensively studied to obtain orange to scarlet reactive dyes particularly superior in build up property and chlorine fastness. As a result, it was found that specified monoazo dyes having as reactive groups both ss sulfatoethylsulfonyl and monochlorotriazinyl groups giVe dyed products of deep orange to scarlet color superior in chlorine fastness.

Alternatively, the compound IV may also be obtained by carrying out coupling in the same manner as above using the N acylated product of the compound III , and then hydrolyzing the resulting compound at 500 to 1000C in the presence of an acid or alkali to split the acyl group. Subsequently, the compound IV is subjected to first step condensation with cyanuric chloride in an aqueous medium while adjusting the pH to 2 to 10, preferably 3 to 7 at a temperature of 100 to 500C, preferably 0 to 300C, thereby to obtain a dichlorotriazinyl compound, and this compound is then subjected to second step condensation with the compound of the formula V while adjusting the pH to 2 to 9, preferably 4 to 6 at a temperature of 0 to 700C, preferably 300 to 5b0C, thereby to obtain the compound of the formula I . 2 Alternatively, the compound I may also be obtained by subjecting the compound V to first step condensation with cyanuric chloride in an aqueous medium while adjusting the pH to 1 to 8, preferably 2 to 6 at a temperature of 100 to 400 C, preferably 0 to 200 C, and then subjecting the resulting compound to second step condensation with the compound IV while adjusting the pH to 2 to 9, preferably 4 to 6 at a temperature of 0 to 700C, preferably 200 to 500C. 3 Cyanuric chloride is condensed with the compounds III and V in optional order in two steps in an aqueous medium while adjusting the pH to 1 to 8 at 100 to 400C for the first step condensation and the pH to 2 to 9 at 0 to 700C for the second step condensation, thereby to obtain a monochlorotriazinyl compound of the formula VI , and this compound is then coupled with the diazonium salt of the aromatic amine II while adjusting the pH to 4 to 10, preferably 5 to 9 at a temperature of 100 to 500C, preferably 0 to 200C, thereby to obtain the compound I . 4 The compound I may also be obtained by subjecting the compound III to first step condensation with cyanuric chloride in an aqueous medium while adjusting the pH to 1 to 8, preferably 2 to 5 at a temperature of 100 to 40 C preferably 0 to 200 C, coupling the resulting compound with the diazonium salt of the aromatic amine II while adjusting the pH to 4 to 10, preferably 5 to 9 at a temperature of 100 to 500 C, preferably 00 to 200 C, thereby to obtain the monoazo compound of the formula VII , and then subjecting the compound VII to second step condensation with the compound V while adjusting the pH to 2 to 9, preferably, 4 to 6 at a temperature of 0 to 700C, preferably .300 to 500C. 5 and 6 The dye I may also be obtained by carrying out the above procedures using a compound of the formula VIII in place of the compound V , followed by final esterification with an acid of 2 to 10 mole ratio at a temperature of 0 to 30 C or further treatment with an alkali while adjusting the pH to 8 to 10 at 200 to 500C. The present compound of the formula I can be used for dyeing cellulose fiber materials in an orange to scarlet color of deep hue by a conventional dyeing method such as exhaustion dyeing, printing and continuous dyeing including a cold pad batch method. Examples of cellulose fiber materials which can be dyed in accordance with the present invention, are natural or regenerated cellulosic fibers such as cotton, flax, viscose rayon, viscose stable and the like. Exhaustion dyeing can be carried out at relatively low temperatures using a dyeing bath containing sodium sulfate or sodium chloride and an acid binding agent such as sodium carbonate, sodium tertiary phosphate or sodium hydroxide. Printing can be carried out by using a print paste containing an acid binding agent e.g. sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium tertiary phosphate, sodium hydroxide , urea and a thickening agent such as preferably sodium alginate, and the printing is followed by intermediate drying and steaming or dry heating at 1000 to 2000C. Further, the dyeing of the present invention may be carried out by a continuous process such as a cold pad batch process. The dyes of the formula I of the present invention have good build up property and produce dyed products superior in chlorine fastness 3 4 grade, ISO standard and perspiration light fastness. Particularly, considering that fading of dyed products due to trace amounts of active chlorine in city water frequently becomes a problem on washing at home, the dyes of the present invention superior in chlorine fastness are of high value. Also, as to perspiration light fastness which has recently become serious with an increase in the demand for sportswear, the grade of that fastness of the present dyes is as high as 3 to 4 grade, which means that the value of the dyes is also high in this respect. Further, the products dyed with the conventional reactive dyes, are affected by acid gases in air to lower fastnesses with the lapse of time. But, in accordance with the present invention, such a drawback can be overcome.That is, the acid stability of dyed products obtained with the dyes of the present invention, as tested as described below, is as good as 4 5 to 5 grade Dyed cloth is dipped in 1 acetic acid for 30 minutes and treated at 37 t 20C for 6 hours under pressure of 125 g cm2 on a perspirometer.The dyes of the present invention are also of high value in this respect. Further, the present dyes have the following great advantages The alkali stability is good enough to show high percent exhaustion and high percent fixation in exhaustion dyeing as well as high percent fixation in printing, and therefore dyed products of deep hue can be obtained. Besides, the present dyes are superior in washing off property. In exhaustion dyeing, the dyes of the present invention are little affected by change in dyeing temperature, alkali agent, amount of inorganic salt and liquor ratio, so that they have a unique performance that dyeing can be carried out with very high reporducibility. The present invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples, which are not however to be interpreted as limiting the invention thereto.Parts and are by weight.Example 1 Cyanuric chloride 9.2 parts is dispersed at 0 to 50C in a solution of a nonionic surfactant 0.1 part in water 100 parts , and a solution of J acid 11.3 parts in water 100 parts produced at a pH of 7 to 8 is added dropwise at 0 to 50C over 1 hour.
