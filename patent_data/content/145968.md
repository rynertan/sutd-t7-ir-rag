# Hot wire air flow meter.

## Abstract
A hot wire air flow meter 5 for internal combustion engines is integrated with a throttle valve 6 so that the throttle valve 6 is disposed immediately downstream of the outlet port 535 of a bypass air passage 53 of the air flow meter. The shaft 62 of the throttle valve 6 inclines at most 45 against a line connecting between the axis of the inlet port of the bypass air passage 53 and the axis of the main air passage 52 of the air flow meter 5 , whereby distur bance caused by the throttle valve 6 is minimized. Further, a bent duct 3 is disposed upstream of the air flow meter 5 so that a plane on which a bent axis of the bent duct is disposed crosses the above mentioned line at an angle of at most 45 , whereby influce of the bent duct 3 on the flow rate measuring accuracy is minimized.
