# STIRLING CYCLE CRYOGENIC COOLER

## Abstract
A long lifetime Stirling cycle cryogenic cooler particular ly adapted for space applications comprised of a compressor section 10 centrally aligned end to end with an expansion section 12 and respectively including a reciprocating com pressor piston 14 and displacer 16 radially suspended in interconnected cylindrical housings 18, 20 by active magne tic bearings 26, 28, 30, 32 and having adjacent reduced clearance regions 82, 84, 108 so as to be in non contacting relationship therewith and wherein one or more of these regions operate as clearance seals. The piston 14 and displacer 16 are reciprocated in their housings 18, 20 by linear drive motors 48, 52 to vary the volume of respectively adjacent compression and expansion spaces 44, 46 which contain a gaseous working fluid and a thermal regenerator 95 to effect Stirling cycle cryogenic cooling. Electrical circuit means 140, 142 are additionally included for energizing the magnetic bearings 26, 28, 30, 32 and for controlling the stroke amplitudes and relative phase angle between the compressor piston 14 and displacer 16 during the cooling cycle.
