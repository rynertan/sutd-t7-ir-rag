# Self switching bidirectional digital line drivers.

## Abstract
To provide reduced vulnerability to glitches, a self switching bidirectional digital line driver comprises two identical circuits 10 20 , coupled in opposite senses between interface nodes 11, 21 and comprising a receiver 12 22 , a NOR gate 13 23 and a transmitter 20 15 and a transmitter connected in series. The output 14 24 of each gate supplies an input to the other gate directly and via a latch 16 26 , resettable by the output of the opposing receiver. Each transmitter has one relaxed mode preferably provided by an open collector transistor and the logic is such that from a rest state corresponding to both transmitters being in the relaxed mode, the switching of one gate locks the other gate into the relaxed mode.
