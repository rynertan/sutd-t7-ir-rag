# ELECTRIC CONTROL DEVICE

## Abstract
An electrical control device 10 , having a transducer 12 for producing a plurality of indicating signals proportional to actual components of a force applied to that transducer by an actuator 14 , which actuator has a capacitance 52 relative to electrical ground. The control device further includes a processor 28 for receiving the plurality of indicating signals and producing a plurality of control signals proportional to the indicating signals. The processor communicates, as shown at 38 , the plurality of control signals to a responding device, such as computer having a visual display. The control device further includes a circuit 40 connected to the processor 28 and to the actuator 14 of the transducer 12 for monitoring the capacitance 52 of the actuator 14 with respect to electrical ground. The circuit 40 connected to the processor 28 to operate as an oscillator, which oscillator has a frequency proportional to the capacitance 52 of the actuator 14 with respect to electrical ground. The processor 28 is configured to recognise variance of the frequency beyond a specified excursion and to respond to such a variance by generating a plurality of updated reference control signals and communicating, as shown at 38 , those updated signals to the responding device.
