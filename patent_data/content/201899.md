# Baling machine.

## Abstract
A baling machine, towed by a tractor, for forming large cylindrical bales of hay has a baling chamber 56 defined by oppositely moving runs 52, 54 of belts 49 trained over rolls. In order to avoid stray hay wrapping round the ends of a roll 26 and thence being ingested in bearings of the roll, a scraper assembly 86 is provided at either end of the roll. The assemblies each comprise a spiral 88 which is welded to the roll and which moves the stray crop away from the end of the roll, and a scraper 90 in light contact with the spiral prevent ing the crop being carried round the roll by the spiral. Possible crop build up at the scraper 90 in wet conditions is reduced further by an auger 100 which is disposed just above the scraper and which is driven, e.g. by one of the belts 101 , to move crop away from the scraper.
