# Method for immunological analysis of trace components.

## Abstract
In a method for the immunological analysis of trace components by marking or labelling an antigen or antibody with a marker, an immune reaction is caused using an antigen or antibody marked with a fogging agent for silver halide, the labelled antigen or antibody is separated from the labelled antigen antibody reaction product, the silver halide is developed in the presence of either one of the labelled antigen or antibody and the labelled antigen anti body reaction product, and the density obtained is mea sured. The method is comparable to radioimmunoassay in having high reproductibility and sufficient sensitivity but does not involve any risk due to radiation.
