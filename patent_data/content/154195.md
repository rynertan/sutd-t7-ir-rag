# MICRO READER

## Abstract
A micro reader which comprises a generally rectangular box like, flattened casing a slide frame slidably supported by the casing for movement between retracted and extended positions, a light permeable screen mounted on and sup ported by the casing for movement between folded and erected postions, and a reflective mirror member carried by the slide frame for movement between laid down and upright positions. When the micro reader is not in use with the slide frame, the screen and the mirror member being held in the retracted, folded and laid down positions, respectively, the screen and the mirror member constitute cover members for covering the top and bottom of a space between the casing and the slide frame, but when the micro reader is in use with the slide frame, the screen and the mirror member held in the extended, erected and upright positions, respectively, the mirror member confronts the screen at a predetermined angle while lying in a plane different from the plane which is occupied by the mirror member when in the laid down position.
