# METHOD FOR MAKING A PHARMACEUTICAL AND OR NUTRITIONAL DOSAGE FORM

## Abstract
A method for making a solid pharmaceutical and or nutritional dosage form that is suitable for oral administra tion. A prescribed dosage of a pharmaceutical or active substance including either or both of a vitamin and mineral is mixed with a carrier or base material comprising cohesive lecithin granules or powder. The resulting combination is blended into a substantially homogeneous mixture having a plastic consistency that is characteristic of the lecithin. The mixture is then shaped into a desired solid form by a conventional technique, such as, for example, that including either extruding, molding, or rolling. The shaped form is then cut into a plurality of convenient, swallowable dosage units ready for packaging and distribution. The dosage units may be coated, so as to be provided with a finished appearance and resistance to moisture.
