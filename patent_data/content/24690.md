ANALGETIC ACTIVITY IN THE MOUSE ANTIPHENYLQUINONE WRITHING TEST A standard procedure for detecting and ctrt the analgetic activity of different classes cf analgesic drugs for which there is a good correlation with human analaetic activity is the prevention of phenyl p benzoquinone induced writhing in mice t Blumberg et al., Proc.

HCl. aspirin suspensions Method 1 , calcium aspirin solution Method 2 , or immediately sequential doses of nalbuphine. HCl and of the aspirin preparations as defined further, or cf the respective vehicles, are injected intraperitoneally with a standard challenge dose of phenyl P benzoquinone 5 min. prior to a designated observation period.The phenyl E benzoquinone is prepared as a 0.1 mg ml solution in 5 by volute of ethanol in water.the writhing dose is 1.25 mg k5 injected at a volume of 0.25 n1 20g. For scoring purposes a writhe is indicated by whole body stretching or contraction of the abdomen during a 10 min. observation period beginning 5 min. after receiving the phenyl p benzoguinone dose.Each mouse is used only once, then discarded. All ED50 values and their 95 confidence limits are determined numerically by the methods ofThompson tW. F. Thompson, Bacteriological Rev., 11, 115 145 1947 , Litchfield and Wilcoxon J. T.Litchfield, Jr. and F. Wilcoxon, J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 96, 99 113 1949 ,or Finney D. J. Finney, Rmbit Analysis , third edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,England, 1971 . As used herein in ED50 means the dosage at which 50 of the mice in a test group exhibit an analgetic response. The interaction of nalbuphine.HCL and aspirin suspensions on phenyl p benzoquinone induced writhing in mice is demonstrated by the data in Table 1 and by the Loewe isobologram S. Loewe, Pharm. Rev., 9, 237242 1957 in Fig. 1. The interaction between nalbu phine.HCL and calcium aspirin solutions is demonstrated in Table 2 and by the Loewe isobologram in Fig. 2. In the isobolographic figures, the analgetic effects of nalbuphine alone are presented on the Y axis and of aspirin alone or calcium aspirin, expressed as aspirin equivalent dosages on the X axis. The dotted lines radiating from the origin represent the fixed dosage ratios of nalbuphine HCl aspirin in the ranges of 1 2.44 to 1 60.9 and 1 1.76 to 1 61.7 for Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.ED50 values representing the calculated dosages where 50 of a group of animals would be expected to exhibit an analgetic response are marked on the Y and X axes, representing nalbuphine and aspirin ED50 s alone, and on the dotted radial lines, representing the nalbuphine and aspirin components of the fixed dosage ratios. The arrows extending above and below each ED50 point represent the 95 confidence limits of the ED50 s. The solid line connecting the ED50 dosages of nalbuphine alone and aspirin alone represents the ED50 addition line , which indicates the expected location of the EDSO s for nalbuphine and aspirin combinations if simple additivity were to describe their combined effects. The 95 confidence range for the ED50 addition line is shown by the area between the broken lines above and below the ED50 addition line. According to Loewe s isobolographic theory, if the analgetic effects of nalbuphine and aspirin were simply additive to one another, the expected location for the ED50 s of the nalbuphine and aspirin components of each fixed dosage ratio would be contained within, or overlap, the region of the ED50 addition line.Combination ED50 s located significantly below the ED50 addition line would represent unexpectedly enhanced analgetic activity and combination ED50 s located above the line would represent unexpectedly diminished analgetic activity. One method to establish the significance of such unexpected enhanced or diminished activity is to calculate the best fitting polynominal regression line to the observed ED50 s using standard mathematical techniques. This ED50 regression line is represented in Figs. 1 and 2 by the curvilinear line connecting all of the ED50 points within their 95 confidence limits.For Fig. 1 the following equation applies Y 5.762 0.08112 x 93.83 0.0009289 x93.83 2 0.00000594 7 93.83 3 where Y represents the ED50 dosage component of nalbuphine and X represents the ED50 dosage component of aspirin. For Fig. 2 the equation given below applies X 56.62 4.476 Y 11.77 0.3168 Y 11.77 2 0.0075 Y 11.77 3 In both cases, analysis of variance demonstrates that the quadratic regressions are significantly different from the ED50 addition lines at the level of P 0.05. Therefore, an unexpectedly enhanced analgetic response can be proven in a mathematically rigorous model utilizing the entire body of data to demonstrate that a curvilinear regression line encanpassinq the ED50 s of each fixed dosage ratio fits the data significantly better than the linear ED50 addition line. While the linear regression analysis demonstrates unexpected enhancement of the analgetic response and predicts that unexpectedly enhanced analgetic activity occurs in theory for all possible combinations of nalbuphine and aspirin, the statistical significance for the endpoint ratios of nalbuphine and aspirin that were actually tested may be proven using either the Least Significant Differences or the Studentized Q method tests described by Snedecor and Cochran G. W. Snedecor and W. G. Cochran, StatisticalMethods , sixth edition, Iowa State University Press,Ames, Iowa 1967 .The expected ED5O s may be read from the graph or alternatively may be calculated by using the formula EMI14.1 where Y is the expected ED50 for the nalbuphine component of a mixture, Y0 is the ED50 for nalbuphine alone, Z is the potency ratio between aspirin and nalbuphine, and R is the ratio of nalbuphine in the total drug composition T X Y. Similarly, the expected ED50 for the aspirin component is found according to EMI15.1 Thus, using the data in Table 2 and Fig. 2 TOTAL DOSE COMBINATION Expected ED50 Observed ED50 SigniNalbuphine Aspirin 95 Conf.

For the two lowest dosages tested, the observed percentage response is clearly greater than the expected response. For the two highest dosages tested, the expected response would actually exceed 100 by summation of the effects of the individual component dosages since the observed response cannot actually exceed 100 , enhancement cannot be measured even though it has most likely occurred with these dosages as well. Using this method, responses that differ by less than 5 can not be considered to be significantly different from each other thus, a response rate of 95.8 in the observed column is not significantly less than a 100 response rate.Similarly, using the date from Table 2 DOSE mg kg RESPONSE Nalbwhi ne Aspirin Naibuphine Aspirin Expected Observed 5.45 48 20.4 16.7 1 8.81 10.9 96 29.7 50.0 21.8 192 90.8 98.1 43.6 384 100 98.1 In this situation, the 1 8.81 drug ratio is the only one where the combination dosages are exactly the same as dosages found in the individual component tests. For the two mid range dosages tested, the observed percentage response is clearly greater than the expected response.For the highest dosage tested, the observed response is again limited by the restraint that it con rupt exceed a 100 response rate however, enhancement of the analgetic response has most likely occurred here as well a 98.1 response is not significantly different from a 100 response using this method . For the lowest dosage tested, analgetic synergism was not observed however, for reasons previously given, a 16.7 response is not significantly different than a 20.4 response. This conventional method would also be expected to show unexpected enhanced analgetic activity for all of the other dosage ratios tested, but since none of the other dosages are identical with the dosages in the individual component tests, the actual test of significance cannot be performed. Therefore, Figs. 1 and 2 and a variety of statistical approaches show that compositions of the invention having a ratio of nalbuphine.HCl to aspirin from about 1 1.76 to 1 61.7 given unexpectedly enhanced analgetic activity. The isobolographic technique, rather than the technique using the sum of the individual component responses, has been used in establishing enhancement for several reasons. First, this technique allows the use of a full range of doses and the calculation of ED50 s and 95 confidence limits for these doses whereas in the conventional method, i.e., the method of comparing the sum of the individual component responses to the response of the combination, the maximum response must be limited to less than 50 for each component. If, in this conventional method, the individual responses are not less than 50 , then it will not be possible to measure enhancement. Secondly, with the isobolographic technique statistical significance is straightforward and can be seen graphically. The calculation of statistics for the technique of using the sum of the individual component responses is more involved. Thirdly, for certain ratios the isobolographic technique as utilized here gives also a presentation of evidence of enhancement via use of the sum of the individual component responses, thereby providing additional corraboration of the results.
