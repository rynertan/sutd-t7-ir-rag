# Error correction in buffer storage units.

## Abstract
In a data processing device comprising a main storage unit 1 , a buffer storage unit 2 , and an ECC portion 3 , when data held in the buffer storage unit contains a single bit error, the data containing the single bit error is moved out from the buffer storage unit by generating enough diffe rent addresses having the same SET number as the data containing the single bit error to change completely the contents of that SET in the buffer memory. The data is then corrected by the ECC portion, and the corrected data is stored in the main storage unit. This can provide an accept ably fast method of error correction while avoiding frequent generation of machine check interrupts.
