# Modified zeolite catalyst composition for alkylating toluene with methanol to form styrene.

## Abstract
A modified zeolite catalyst composition and process for using the catalyst composition to alkylate toluene or deriva tive thereof with methanol to form e.g. styrene and ethylben zene or derivatives thereof is disclosed. The catalyst com position is exemplified by a type X or Y zeolite modified with 1 at least one alkali metal selected from Cs, K, and Rb 2 at least one metal selected from Li, Ce, Cr, andAg and 3 boron and or phosphorus.
