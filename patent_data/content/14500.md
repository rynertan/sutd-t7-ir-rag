# X ray powder diffractometer.

## Abstract
A computer controlled asymmetric texture sensitive parafocussing X ray powder diffractometer employs an incremental rotating specimen holder for azimuthal rotation through an angle . The specimen holder is rotatable through an angle α from a symmetric position in which the specimen surface normal makes an angle 90 ϑ with both the source to specimen and detector to specimen directions. In order to maintain the Brentano focussing condition, the detector is supported on a slide which can be moved towards and away from the specimen by a stepper motor drive. A ratio K of the detector to specimen distance R on the one hand and the X ray source to specimen distance P on the other hand is constrained to a range c K f. The desired focussing condition is realized by computer control which maintains K sin ϑ α sin ϑ α and modifies the measured value of the intensity by multiplying it by 0.5 K 1 K
