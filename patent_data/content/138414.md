# METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING BAKED GOODS CONTAINING SOFT FLAVOR CHIPS

## Abstract
A process is described for manufacturing flavor chip con taining baked goods, such as cookie products, wherein the flavor chips, although themselves normally solid at ambient conditions, develop within the product a soft texture which is maintained during extended storage. The process relies upon maintaining freshly baked flavor chip containing cookies at temperatures of from about 20 C to 50 C for a predetermined period of time before returning the cookies to normal temperature conditions encountered during storage.
