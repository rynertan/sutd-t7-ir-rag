# Insulation displacement coaxial cable termination and method.

## Abstract
A cable assembly 10 made up a plurality of co planar individual coaxial cables, each having a signal wire 12 and a coaxial conductive sheath 14 including a ground wire 16 coplanar with the signal wires 12 , are terminated by inserting the end of the cable assembly 10 in a housing component 50 which also receives an array of insulation displacement contacts 82 supported by another housing component 70 along an axis transverse to the plane of the cable assembly. Each signal wire 12 and each ground wire 16 is then electrically contacted by a respective one of the insulation displacement contacts 82a, 82b . The cable assembly is secured to the first housing 50 which is also secured to the other housing component 70 .
