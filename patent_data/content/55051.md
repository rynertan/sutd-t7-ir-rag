# Thermal serial dot printer.

## Abstract
The printer comprises a thermal print head on the rear side of a plate 54 carried by a carriage 27 and cooperating with a bar 83 which is pivoted on an axis 88 in such a man ner as to adapt its angular position to the surface of the head, on the basis of the thickness of the paper. The paper is fed by two rollers 9 and 10 which are rotated in a differential manner in order to keep the paper under tension. One of the rollers is mounted on an eccentric 92 to enable the parallelism of the two rollers to be adjusted. The head 53 is removably mounted on the carriage 27 , and is connected to a connector by way of a flexible ribbon cable 64 which is connected to the head 53 by way of a flexible cable in the form of conductor rings com pressed between the conductors at the end of the cable and printed conductors on an alumina plate 56 cemented to the plate 54 .
