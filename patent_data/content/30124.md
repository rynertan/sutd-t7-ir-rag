# Method of and apparatus for processing polyethylene terephthalate preforms.

## Abstract
This relates to the heating of polyethylene terephthalate by way of RF energy. It has been found that if polyethylene terephthalate articles are passed through a radio frequency energy field, the molecules thereof will become excited and rapid heating will result. This heating is particularly useful in the heating of preforms prior to the blow molding thereof and by varying the configuration and relationship of electrodes, controlled heating of the preforms may be effected with it being possible to have a controlled temperature differential along the length of the preform or other article so heated.
