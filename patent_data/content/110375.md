# Magnetic recording and reproduction system.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording and reproduction system of a heli cal scanning type provided with audio heads 18, 19 which ro tate together with the rotary video heads 16, 17 so that the frequency modulated audio signal is recorded by the audio heads on the video track on which the video signal will also be recorded. The audio signal is recorded first on the video track, and then the video signal is recorded over the record of the au dio signal whereby the audio signal has an expanded frequen cy band thereby to provide an improved sound quality.
