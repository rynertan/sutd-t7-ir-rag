# Comminuted meats production thereof and binders therefor.

## Abstract
Comminuted meats can be effectively bound using a blend comprising from 99.5 to 50 of water soluble protein containing material such as alkali metal caseinates, and from 0.5 to 50 of a hydrocolloid. Preferably, the blend also includes a byproduct resulting from the concentration of whey protein from whey. The products are effective meat binders for oomminuted meats and particularly non specific loaves. In a novel binder the water soluble protein material is an alkali metal caseinate or a whey protein concentrate and a byproduct from the gel filtration of whey, the permeate resulting from the ultrafiltration of whey or the delactosed permeate resulting from the ultrafiltration of whey in a ratio of 75 25 to 25 75.
