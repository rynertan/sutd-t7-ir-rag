## Description
PRODUCT PUSHER DEVICE This invention relates to a product pusher device useful with an improved cutting apparatus for severing slices from a comestible product or workbody especially meat bodies, including frozen products and those having bones. More particularly, it relates to an improved product pusher device for a rotary magazine that carries comestible products past a slicing knife. The invention is suitable for use with the cutting apparatus disclosed in co pending applicationNo. 81105760.3 filed July 21, 1981. Cutting apparatus of the general type noted above is shown in U. S. Patent Nos. 3,434,519 3,587,689 3,693,684 3,782,230 3,831,475 and 3,985,057. The apparatus disclosed therein moves a product carried by a receptacle in an endless horizontal path past a cutter, which severs sections from the product. Advantageously, the receptacle has an inclined interior surface that directs the product downward into cutting position in response to rotational force and rearward to minimize any tendency of the product to move upward during the severing operation. The receptacles are upright rubular or trough like affairs secured at a lower end to a base, as by welding or with screws. The base is driven from a central supporting shaft and has openings in line with the receptacles, through which the product passes. Relatively heavy product pushers are located within and slide along the receptacles. Each pusher rests on the upper end of a product to urge it downward through the magazine, into the path of the cutter. During load ing, each pusher must be raised with one hand and held while a product is inserted into the receptacle with the other hand. It is particularly difficult to load heavy pieces of meat, which may weigh up to 50 pounds, with one hand. At the present time, different pushers are used for different products. For example, frozen pork loin has a bone, a sloped upper end, and is small in width, which allows it to be completely received within the receptacle, but which requires that it be held against tipping. As a result, a pusher is used having an inclined transverse surface and extending tines or cleats to grip the upper end of the product. When the product has been sliced, the end or heel piece must be removed from the tines. On the other hand, pieces of large fresh meat to be cut are usually greater in width than the receptacle, extend laterally through and beyond an open side thereof, and require a larger and flat pushing surface. This need for different pushers results in extra equipment expense, handling, and storage space.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides new and improved product pushers for cutting apparatus used for severing slices from a comestible product. The improved product pushers are constructed for movement along a guide of an upright receptacle that forms a part of a magazine that moves a comestible product past a cutter. The pushers each have a body that moves along the guide, and a surface that moves with the body, extends transversely of the guide, and engages the upper end of the product. The body carries a catch that engages the receptacle and prevents downward movement along the guide when the body is in a raised position. This allows an operator to raise the pusher and then use both hands to position a product in a receptacle, beneath the pusher. A mechanism on the body is manually operable to release the catch and permit downward movement of the body by gravity to urge the product through the magazine. The release mechanism is constructed to facilitate operation with one hand.Thus, the operator can release and lower the pusher into contact with the product with one hand while retaining the product in the receptacle with the other hand until the pusher engages the top surface. In a preferred construction the transverse surface has two angularly related portions and a flat member that extends beneath one of the portions and generally in the plane of the other portion. The flat member can be moved against a yieldable biasing force toward the overlying surface portion. It has openings that receive tines or cleats extending from the overlying transverse surface portion. In use, the weight of the pusher exerts a force against a product through the transverse surface and the underlying flat member. When a product underlies only the flat member, the weight of the pusher overcomes the yieldable biasing force and the flat member moves from its spaced location to a position against the overlying angular transverse surface, exposing the tines or cleats.Upon removal of the pushing force, as when the pusher reaches a lowered position where it is stopped by the magazine base, the biasing force moves the flat member away from the transverse surface so the flat member acts as a stripper plate to remove the remaining product from the pusher tines. This advances the remaining product toward the cutting blade, allowing additional slices to be cut. With this construction, large and small products can be effectively pushed with a single product pusher. A pork loin, for example, with a small cross section and inclined upper end can be received beneath only the yieldably biased flat mem ber and its overlying inclined transverse surface.This results in the flat member being pushed against the overlying transverse surface, oriented at an angle that is compatible with the end surface of the product and that resists tipping of the product, permitting engagement of the cleats or tines that also help retain the pork loin against tipping. Yet, when a large product with a flat, level, upper end is received in the receptacle, the extended flat member and the other transverse surface portion, which lie in a common plane, overlie and rest against the larger top surface of the product and urge it downward. Typically, the cleats or tines, which remain recessed behind i.e., above the flat member or stripper plate, are not required for larger more stable products and tines on the other transverse surface portion adequately hold the product. A modified embodiment provides projecting grippers on the biased flat plate to aid in gripping the product when the tines remain recessed. It also has a stop member operable to selectively prevent the flat member from being forced out of the common plane and against the overlying angularly related surface. This permits force to be more uniformly applied against a large product having a flat top surface. A further embodiment provides a two piece transverse surface, one piece being pioted relative to the other between a first position in a common plane and a second position angularly related, to form a surface similar to that of the fixed portions of the previously described embodiment. This provides a strong and more rigid transverse surface in a common plane than does the yieldably biased flat member and accommodates the same variety of products. Moreover, if desired, it can be used with a stripper plate of the construction described. The above and other features and advantages of the invention will become better understood from the detailed description that follows, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.Brief Description of Drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of a cutting apparatus embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a partial perspective view of a rotary magazine of the apparatus of Figure 1 showing a product pusher embodying the present invention Figure 3 is a partial sectional view of a product recepticle and the follower of Figure 2 Figure 4 is an exploded perspective view of the product follower of Figure 2 Figure 5 is a top plan view of the follower ofFigure 2 with parts removed Figure 6 is a side elevational view of the follower of Figure 2 with parts removed Figure 7 is a partial sectional view with parts in elevation of the follower of Figure 2 taken along the line 7 7, showing the catch mechanism in a closed or latching position Figure 8 is a partial sectional view similar toFigure 8, showing the catch mechanism in a release position Figure 9 is a side elevational view of another embodiment of a product pusher of the present invention Figure 10 is a partial sectional view taken along the line 10 10 of Figure 9 Figure 11 is a bottom plan view of the pusher ofFigure 9 Figure 12 is a sectional view. with parts in elevation taken along the line 12 12 of Figure 9 showing a catch for the pusher in a closed or latching position Figure 13 is a view similar to Figure 12 of the latch in an open or release position Figure 14 is an enlarged partial view with parts in section showing the catch mechanism of Figure 9 in a latching position Figure 15 is a view similar to Figure 14 showing the mechanism in a release position Figure 16 is a top plan view partly in section of another embodiment of a product pusher Figure 17 is a side elevational view partly broken away and partly in section of the pusher of Figure 16 Figure 18 is a partial enlarged view of the pusher of Figure 17 Figure 19 is a view taken along the line 19 19 ofFigure 18 Figure 20 is a view taken along the line 20 20 ofFigure 18 Figure 21 is a side elevational view similar toFigure 18 showing a part of the pusher in a pivoted position and Figure 22 is a view similar to Figure 20 with a part in pivoted position as in Figure 21.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Referring to the drawings, a cutting apparatus embodying this invention is shown in Figure 1, indicated generally by the reference numeral 20. The apparatus includes a wheeled stand 22 having a horizontally disposed, vertically adjustable, table 24 a rotatable magazine assembly 26 disposed above the table 24 and rotatably supported for moving one or more products through an endless path and a rotary knife assembly 28 supported by the stand 22 and located partially in an opening or recess in the table 24. The magazine assembly 26 is carried on a vertical shaft 30, is open at the bottom, and moves products to be sliced across the rotary knife assembly 28. Product pushers 31 carried by the magazine assembly urge the products to be sliced through the magazine.The knife assembly has a discshaped horizontal blade that severs a slice or section from a product as it is moved by the magazine assembly.The slice is received on a rotatable table 34 secured to the stand 22. For safety, the blade is covered by a guard. The table 24 supports the bottom end of products moved by the magazine assembly and is adjustable in height relative to the rotary knife assembly 28 to change the thickness of slices to be severed from the product.This adjustment is accomplished by an adjusting wheel and screw 36. The relationship between the knife blade and magazine, the manner in which they are driven, and other ways of adjusting the table height, are all shown in the above mentioned patents, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The magazine assembly 26 includes a circular base 40 of molded plastic that provides two spaced, tubular, product receiving passages 49, 50 diametrically across from each other and a central hub portion 52. The upper end of the central hub portion 52 has a rectangular slot for facilitating a driving connection between the shaft and base, through a clamp plate 71, to transmit rotary motion. A threaded stud extends from the top of the shaft 30 to receive a clamp knob 74 that acts against the plate 71 to retain the base on the shaft. Two trough like receptacles 76 are supported in an upright position, one in each passage 49, 50, at diametrically opposite ends, so that each is at the back end of its passage relative to the direction of rotation of the base across the knife, indicated by the arrow A inFigure 1. Each receptacle 76 is formed of stainless steel sheetmetal, of uniform cross section, and shaped to conform to the end of the receiving passage. A lower end of each receptacle is partially telescoped within the receiving passage, resting against a tapered wall portion. As best shown in Figure 2, parallel flanges 88, 89 of each receptacle extend outwardly from the open side in a common plane and support a product pusher 31 that slides up and down on the receptacle and serves to urge a product P retained in the receptacle in a downward direction to facilitate slicing. The flanges end at the top of the base, as best illustrated in Figure 2. The two product pushers 31 of Figure 1 are identical and one is shown in detail in Figures 3 8. The pusher 31 has a bottom plate 134 for engaging the top of a product in the receptacle and has an upright support 138 secured to the bottom plate. Braces 140 extend between the two for rigidity. The pusher also has a plastic slide 142 with inwardly facing grooves 144, 145 that receive the flanges 88, 89 of the respective receptacle, and guide the assembly in sliding movement along the receptacle. The slide 142 and support 138 are held together with a screw 147 of an outwardly extending handle 148, the screw extending through the slide and being received in a threaded aperture 149 of the support 138. The handle is used to raise the pusher to an upper position shown in Figure 2 when a product is inserted into the receptacle. The weight of the assembly then bears against a top surface of a product and urges it downward and in some cases inward toward the back of the receptacle. The bottom plate 134 has two flat angularly related portions 134a, 134b extending in opposite directions from the upright support 138. The portion 134a is of a size to fit within a receptacle 76, extends in a direction into the receptacle in use, and forms an acute angle with the upright support 138. The portion 134b extends at a right angle to the support 138 in a direction away from the receptacle, and is of a size to fit within the passages 49 and 50 of the magazine base, as is apparent from Figures 1 and 2. Two rows 155, 156 of cleats or tines extend from the bottom surface of plate portion 134a and three rows 157, 158 and 159 extend from the bottom surface of the portion 134b. These cleats or tines serve to pierce and retain the product in an upright position within the receptacle. A flat stripper plate 160 extends beneath the plate portion 134a at a right angle to the upright support 138 and essentially in the plane of the plate portion 134b. The stripper plate has an elongated integral support portion 160a that extends at a right angle and is positioned against the upright support 138, extending through an open slot 162 in the plate portion 134b at the base of the upright support. An aperture 164 in the support portion 160a receives the screw 147 of the handle 148 and is elongated in a direction to allow the stripper plate support portion 160a to be adjusted a short distance longitudinally to move the stripper plate toward and away from the bottom plate 134. The support portion 160a is clamped in place between the upright support 138 and the slide 142 by the handle 148.The stripper plate is of spring metal and is yieldably pivoted relative to the support portion 160a when only the pusher portion 134a rests against a product, as illustrated in Figure 3. Two slots 165, 166 Figure 4 receive the cleats or tines 155, 156, respectively when the stripper plate is biased against the bottom of the plate 134a. When the pusher is lifted after a product has been sliced, the plate portion 134a returns to the plane of the portion 134a, stripping any remaining heel of the product from the cleats. Also, when the product is large enough that the plate portion 134b is supported on the product, the stripper plate is spring biased to a parallel substantially co planar position on the product. A catch or latching mechanism 170 on the slide 142 serves to automatically hold the pusher at the top of the magazine when it is raised, until it is manually released, after which it rests against the top of the product P. The latching permits the operator to use both hands to place the product in the magazine and to then hold the product in place with one hand while releasing and lowering the product follower with the other. The latch mechanism 170 includes two pins 174, 176 Figures 4, 7 and 8 axially movable in holes 178, 180 in the slide. The holes extend through the grooves 144, 145 so the pins block the grooves when in the position shown in Figure 7, to which they are urged by compression springs 182, 183, movement being limited by heads 174a, 176a. The springs are retained within cups 186, 187 secured to the opposite end of each pin from the head by a screw 189, 190, respectively. The screws also attach an operating bar 192 to the cups and pins.A narrow longitudinal slot 194, 195 along each pin receives a guide pin 196, 197 located in the slide, to keep the pins 174, 176 from rotating. A transverse slot 200, 201 extends approximately half way through the thickness of each pin, located to be within the thickness of the slide 142, displaced from the grooves 144, 145, when the springs 182, 183 hold the pins 174, 176 with their heads ajacent the slide Figure 7 and located to be aligned with the grooves when the springs are compressed and the cups 186, 187 are located against the slide Figure 8 . Thus, when the pusher is at the top of a magazine, the pins will be in the position ofFigure 7 and will rest against the top edges of the associated magazine flanges 88, 89, holding the pusher in a raised position.When the pins are moved to the position of Figure 8 by movement of the operating bar 192 toward the slide, they will then allow downward movement of the pusher. Once the pins 174, 176 move below the top edge of the flanges, the operating bar can be released and the pins will not interfere with sliding movement of the pusher. The pins 174, 176 can only return to a blocking position, which they do automatically, when the pusher is raised to position the pins above the flanges. A second embodiment of a product pusher 200 is shown in Figures 9 15 of the drawings. This product pusher has a bottom plate 202 for engaging the top of a product P in a receptacle and has an upright support 204 secured to the bottom plate. Braces 206 extend between the two for rigidity. A plastic slide 208 secures the pusher to a receptacle by inwardly facing grooves 210, 211 that receive the receptacle flanges 88, 89. The slide 208 and support 204 are held together with a screw 214 of an outwardly extending handle 216, the screw extending through the slide and being received in a threaded aperture of the support. The bottom plate 202 has two flat angularly related portions 202a, 202b extending in opposite directions from the upright support 204. The portion 202a fits within a receptacle and forms an acute angle with the upright support 204. The portion 202b extends at a right angle to the support 204 in the direction away from a receptacle and fits within the passages 49 and 50 of the magazine base. Two rows 218, 219 of cleats or tines extend from the bottom surface of the plate portion 202a and three rows 220, 221, 222 extend from the bottom surface of the plate portion 2025. A flat stripper plate 226 extends beneath the plate portion 202a at a right angle to the upright support 204 and essentially in the plane of the plate portion 202b. It has an elongated integral support portion 226a that extends at a right angle and is positioned against the upright support 204, extending through an open slot 227 in the plate portion 202b. The stripper plate is adjustable in the same manner as the plate 160 of the previous embodiment and is of spring metal to yieldably pivot relative to the support portion when force is applied. Two slots 228, 229 in the stripper plate receive the rows of cleats or tines. Projecting circular flanges 230 on the stripper plate serve a similar function to the cleats or tines when the stripper plate is in the extended position shown in Figure 9, in which the major portion of the rows 218, 219 of cleats are recessed. A finger 232, shown in detail in Figure 10, extends upwardly from the stripper plate adjacent a perimeter portion of the bottom plate 202a. It has two inwardly extending transverse parallel flanges 234, 235, relatively closely spaced, and positioned to straddle the bottom plate 202a. The two flanges engage the bottom plate to selectively hold the stripper plate against pivoting movement relative to the bottom plate, so that the stripper plate can act as a bottom plate in the plane of bottom plate portion 202b, when desired, as when a product has a relatively large and flat top surface. The finger 232 is yieldable and resilient and can readily be moved laterally outwardly of the position shown inFigure 10 so the flanges 234, 235 clear the peripheral edge of the bottom plate 202a.The lower flange 234 can then be placed above the bottom plate 202a, allow ing the stripper plate to pivot under applied force, to a position against the bottom of the bottom plate portion 202a, under the circumstances as illustrated inFigure 3 in connection with the previous embodiment. A catch or latching mechanism 240 on the slide 208 serves to automatically hold the pusher at the top of the magazine when it is raised, until it is manually released to rest against a top of a product. The mechanism includes two pins 242, 244 axially movable in holes 246, 248 in the slide. The holes extend through the grooves 210, 211 so the pins block the grooves when in the position shown in Figure 12, to which they are urged by compression springs 250, 252, acting between a head of each pin and a face of the slide. A transverse connecting bar 256 on the opposite side of the slide from the springs is secured to the ends of the pins 242, 244, as by screws 257, restrains the pin movement by the springs, and carries an over center lever or toggle 258 secured by a pivot pin 260 between ears 262, 264 extending from the connecting bar.The lever acts through a central opening 266 of the connecting bar, and a cam surface 268 of the lever acts against the face of the slide 208. When the lever 258 is moved from the position shown in Figure 14 in which the pins are as shown in Figure 12 to the position shown inFigure 15, it draws the connecting bar 256 away from the slide 208, compressing the springs 250, 252 and slides the pins 242, 244 axially to align slots 268 with the grooves 210, 211, as shown in Figure 13, to permit lowering of the pusher. The lever 258 pivots to an over center position and is retained under the force of the springs 250, 252, pivoting beyond the desired position of Figure 15 being prevented by a stop 269 on the ear 262.The lever 258 is easily actuated by an operator with one finger, while holding the handle 216, by wnich the operator would then lower the pusher until it contacts the upper surface of a product in the magazine. Similarly, when a pusher is raised from a lowered position to the top of the magazine, the operator can merely flip the lever 258 upward from the Figure 15 position to the Figure 14 position and the pusher will be retained at the top of the magazine by the magazine flanges. A further embodiment of a product pusher 278 is shown in Figures 16 22 of the drawings. This pusher provides a bottom plate of two pieces 280, 282. The piece 280 is integral with an upright support 284 and basically corresponds to the plate portion 134b and 202b of the previously described embodiments. The support 284 is secured to a slide, such as the slide 142 or 208. The plate 282 is pivoted to the support 284 adjacent the plate 280, by fasteners 286, 287. To facilitate this connection, two plate 290, 291 are fastened to an upper surface of the pivoted plate 282, perpendicular to the plate and located to closely straddle the upright support 284. A cross bar 292 extends between the two perpendicular plates and is positioned behind the upright support 284 i.e., to the right inFigure 17 , to limit downward pivoting of the plate 282 beyond the plane of the plate 280.That is, downward pivoting is limited to the solid line position of Figure 17. A second cross bar 294 is located in front of the upright 284, between the perpendicular plates 290, 291 and carries a pin 296 that extends toward the upright.The pin supports and guides a compression spring 298 that acts between the cross bar 294 and the upright support 284, biasing the pivoted plate 282 to the solid line position of Figure 17, co planer with the plate 280. As best shown in Figures 18 22, an L shaped latch member 300 is secured by a pivot bolt 302 to the upright 284 on the side from which the plate 280 extends. The latch member is located just below the cross bar 292 and is rotatable through at least 900. It has a handle portion 300a that extends rearwardly from the upright support 284 and a keeper portion 300b parallel to and adjacent the upright support, but spaced therefrom by a washer 303 a distance substantially equal to the thickness of the cross bar 292. When the keeper portion 300b is in a vertical position, extending upward relative to the plate 280, it cooperates with the cross bar 292 to position the plate 282 in either its solid line position or phantom position of Figure 17. Those positions are shown in detail in Figures 18 and 21.A front surface 304 of the keeper portion is inclined and a back surface 306 is flat and parallel to the cross bar 292. When the plate 282 is co planer with the plate 280, as illustrated in Figure 18, the handle 300a is rotated to bring the inclined surface 304 against the back surface 292a of the cross bar, forcing the cross bar into tight engagement against the back of the upright support 284 with a wedging action, which assures that the handle will remain in the rotated position and that the pivoted plate 282 will be rigidly retained in a co planer position with the plate 280. If the handle is rotated 900 counterclockwise from the positions shown in Figures 18 20, the keeper portion 300b will be located beneath the cross bar 292 and the plate 282 can be pivoted to the position of Figure 21.Rotation of the handle of the keeper 900 clockwise will then again position the keeper in a vertical upright location where the flat surface 306 will cooperate with a front surface 292b of the cross bar, holding the plate 282 in the phantom position against the biasing force of the spring 298. In its pivoted position, the plate 282 is equivalent to the plate portion 134a or 202a. The plate 280 has three rows of tines 310, 311 and 312, and the pivoted plate 282 has two rows of tines 313, 314 to engage the product against which the pusher works.This construction, which allows the selective repositioning of a portion of the pusher plate to either an inclined or co planer position allows a single pusher to be used where both large products having flat upper portions are used and small products with inclined top surfaces.The construction is extremely sturdy and has the advantage over the other embodiments of providing a firmly positioned and fixed flat plate when desired. While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it will be apparent that various modifications and alterations may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention set forth in the appended claims.
