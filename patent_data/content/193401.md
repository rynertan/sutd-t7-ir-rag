# PROJECTION TYPE LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICE

## Abstract
A cholesteric nematic phase transition type liquid crystal with positive dielectric anisotropy is used in a projection type liquid crystal display device. This allows a bright and high information content display with a compact, light, and low cost device and allows machinery input and thus simul taneous display at remote places, such as remote conference rooms or remote notice boards, in bright locations.
