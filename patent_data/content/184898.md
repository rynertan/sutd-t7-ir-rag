# Method for logging a borehole employing dual radiation detectors.

## Abstract
For logging a borehole, a sonde 16 having a source 20 of penetrating radiation and at least two longitudinally spaced radiation detectors 26,36 , is passed within a borehole. Count rate data are produced by each of the detectors and are continu ously compared to predetermined count rate relationship which may be obtained from detectors operating in reference standard boreholes. In accordance with this count rate data comparison, the suitability of either the ratio or spine rib analytical method is determined and the appropriate technique is auto matically applied to produce an indication of a logged para meter such as formation porosity, selctively compensated for a borehole environmental condition such as variations in bore hole diameter.
