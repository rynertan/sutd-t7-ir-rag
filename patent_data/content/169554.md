# Industrial robot.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an industrial robot free from generation of dust, which is provided with and internal space formed by covering rotating portions and contact portions of its arm members, joint members, bearing members or driving source, by the arm members, joint members, bearing members, or a cover member, or by a combination of these members, and air throttling portions provided in air pas sages for connecting the internal space with external air so as to separate the internal space from external air by sucking the air in the internal space. By the above air throttling portions, air within the internal space is isolated from the external air, and thus, scattering of dust from the dust generating portions toward the atmosphere is advan tageously prevented.
