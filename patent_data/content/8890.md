# Process for producing calcium fluoborate.

## Abstract
Dry calcium fluoborate suitable for use in the manufac ture of boron trifluoride is produced by reacting, in an aque ous medium, calcium fluoride, hydrofluoric acid and boric acid followed by removing water from the calcium fluobo rate reaction product by purging the reaction product with a dry inert gas such as nitrogen, at a temperature between about 140 to 160 C.
