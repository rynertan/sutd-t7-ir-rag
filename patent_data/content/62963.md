# Solderless electrical connector for insulated wires.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for non prestripped wires has a lower housing part 1 with wire guides, each comprising a double channel consisting of an upper introduction channel 47 having a cross section suited for the introduction of a wire 7 and therebelow a parallel clamping channel 49 connected to the introduction channel by a constricted transition slit 51 . A projection provided at an upper housing forces the wire at least partly into and through the transition slit 51 and into a recess 37 in the lower housing part 1 upon telescoping of the upper housing part into the lower housing part, thereby clamping the wire to strain relieve it.
