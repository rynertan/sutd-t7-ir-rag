The present invention relates to a distributed feedback semiconductor laser device and or a distributed Bragg reflection semiconductor laser device which attains laser oscillation at a wavelength ranging from Semiconductor laser devices, which are used as light sources for optical information processing systems and or optical measurement systems utilizing optical fibers therein, are required to have operation characteristics achieving laser oscillation in a single longitudinal mode. As laser devices achieving laser oscillation in a single longitudinal mode, distributed feedback semiconductor lasers and distributed Bragg reflection semiconductor lasers which have a diffraction grating with a periodic corrugation on or near the active region are known Nikkei Electronics Vol. 12, No. 21 pp 66 70 1981 . Figure On the other hand, a semiconductor laser device attaining laser oscillation at a shorter wavelength of In order to eliminate this problem, a distributed feedback semiconductor laser device, in which an InGaPAs crystal is used as a material for the optical guiding layer instead of the GaAlAs crystal, has been proposed by the inventors in US A 4803513.
