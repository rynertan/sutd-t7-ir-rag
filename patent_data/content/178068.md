# Improvements in or relating to detecting radioactive components in dry active waste.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for detecting radioactive components in dry active waste. The apparatus comprises a means for reducing the waste to pieces of substantially uniform size and first and second radiation detecting means. Means are provided for conveying the pieces from the reducing means to the first and second radiation detecting means. Means are provided for dispersing the pieces of waste between the first and second detecting means so that the pieces which are collected together in clusters can separate from each other to thereby increase the likelihood of detecting radiation emanating from the pieces. The method comprises the steps of reducing the waste to pieces of substantially uniform size, examining the pieces for radiation emanating therefrom and then dispersing them and then examining them a second time for radiation.
