# Process for the preparation of alkanol alkoxylates.

## Abstract
Alkanol alkoxylates having utility, for example, as non ionic surfactants in detergent formulations are prepared in accordance with the invention by the reaction of C₆ to C₃₀ alkanols with C₂ to C₄ alkylene oxides in the presence of a co catalyst combination comprising as a first component one or more alkanol soluble basic compounds of magnesium and as a second component one or more alkanol soluble compounds of at least one element selected from the group consisting of aluminium, boron, zinc, titanium, silicon, molybdenum, vanadium, gallium, germanium, yttrium, zirconium, niobium, cadmium, indium, tin, antimony, tungsten, hafnium, tantalum, thallium, lead, and bismuth.
