# Radiation image recording and read out apparatus with sectored image recording capability.

## Abstract
Stimulable phosphor sheets are circulated through an image recording section for recording radiation images on the stimulable phosphor sheets, an image read out section for scanning the stimulable phosphor sheets with stimulat ing rays and detecting light emitted thereby upon stimula tion, and an erasing section for releasing radiation energy remaining on the stimulable phosphor sheets. The image recording section is provided with a shutter which is selectively moveable between a standby position in which it permits radiation to reach the whole area of the stimulable phosphor sheet and a shielding position in which it shields a part of the stimulable phosphor sheet from the radiation. The means for conveying the stimulable phosphor sheet through the image recording section is provided with a control means for causing the stimulable phosphor sheet to be conveyed by sectors when the shutter is in the shielding position, whereby sectored image recording in which two or more radiation images are recorded on respective sectors of a single stimulable phosphor sheet can be carried out.
