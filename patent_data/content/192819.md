# Collective wiring system and method of control thereof.

## Abstract
A collective wiring system for an automobile provides a central control unit CCU which communicates with a plurality of terminal control units LCU each connected to one or more input or output devices 93, 94, 95, 96 , such as switches, sensors, motors and the like. The control over output devices in response to the status of input devices is performed by the central control unit CCU on the basis of tables of data stored in memory 102, 103 . A scan table SCNTBL controls the order in which data communications are made to the terminal control units LCU to obtain their status and provide them with control commands. A monitor table STATTBL stores the current status of the terminal control units LCU and a control table CNTLTB stores the control data for the terminal control units LCU . A connection table CCTBL stores the relationship between the terminal control unit LCU for an input device and the terminal control unit LCU for the output device to be controlled thereby. Thus, connection control between input and output devices is effected by software.
