# Automatic processing machine for light sensitive color photographic material.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an automatic processing machine for a light sensitive color photographic material, having a color developing tank as the formost tank of the processing tanks and a stabilizing tank as the last tank of the processing tanks, which comprises having a system for conveying a light sensitive material which will not bring the stabilizing liquid components filled in the stabilizing tank into the color developing solution filled in the color developing tank. According to the automatic processing machine of the present invention, the technical task can be solved as a matter of course, and moreover no requirement for piping, no discharging of waste solutions of processing and its small size will result in exhibiting such effects that it can be installed on a floor of higher stage and also be moved, if necessary.
