# Method for inhibiting polymerization of conjugated dienes.

## Abstract
In a process for separating a conjugated diene from a hydrocarbon mixture containing the conjugated diene by extractive distillation using dimethyl formamide as an ertrac tive solvent, a method for inhibiting polymerization of the conjugated diene in the dimethyl formamide at a high temp erature which comprises using furfural and furfural polycon densates as polymerization inhibitors, and controlling the amounts of the polymerization inhibitors such that about 0.01 to about 2 by weight, based on the solvent, of furfural and about 0.5 to about 10 by weight, based on the solvent, of the furfural polycondensates are present in a total amount of about 1 to about 12 by weight, based on the solvent, throughout the entire separating process.
