# INTEGRATED HEAT EXCHANGE AND HEAT STORAGE SYSTEM USING LOW TEMPERATURE THERMOCHEMICAL REACTIONS

## Abstract
An integrated heat exchange and heat storage system utilizing thermochemical reactions comprising a bunch of parallel adjacent tubes 2 containing a substance for storing and yielding heat, and a group of tubes 3 parallel to the first mentioned tubes and interposed therebetween and containing a fluid, heat carrying vehicle this system of tubes being disposed in a receptacle whose major axis extends parallel to the axis of the tubes, wherein the voids 12 between the tubes are filled with a stagnant liquid serving to facilitate heat exchange between the fluid, heat carrying vehicle and the substance for storing and yielding heat. This system can be used, for example, with solar collectors to produce energy during the daytime or summer, or with existing heating systems to recover waste heat during the night or in the winter.
