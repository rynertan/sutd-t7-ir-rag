FR 900 216 substance Rhizoxin used according to the present invention can be produced by fermentation of FR 900 216 substance producing strains belonging to the genus Rhizophus such as Rhizopus sp. No. F1360 deposited with ATCC on November 21, 1979 under the Number of ATCC 20577 in a nutrient medium. Particulars of microorganism Rhizopus sp. No. F 1360 ATCC No. 20577 which can be used for producing FR 900 216 substance Rhizoxin and production thereof will be explained in the following The microorganism which can be used for the production of FR 9002l6 substance is a strain belonging to the genus Taxonomic characteristics of From above mentioned characteristics, the strain was considered to be one strain of the zygomycete genus A culture of This invention also includes the use of any mutants which are capable of producing FR 900216 substance, including natural mutants which are produced by natural mutation of the organism as well as artificial mutants which can be produced from the described organism by conventional means, such as X rays, ultraviolet radiation, treatment with a mutating agent such as nitrogen mustard oils, azaserine, nitrous acid, 2 aminopurine, N,N nitro N nitrosoguanidine NTG or the like, treatment with phage, transformation, transduction, conjugation and the like. The FR 900216 substance of this invention is produced when a FR 900216 substance producing strain belonging to the genus The preferred sources of carbon in the nutrient medium are carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, maltose, glycerin, starch, soluble starch, dextrin and the like. The preferred sources of nitrogen are meat extract, hydrolyzed casein, peptone, gluten meal, corn meal, cotton seed flour, soy bean meal, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, yeast extract, urea, ammonium phosphate, etc. The carbon and nitrogen sources, though advantageously employed in combination, need not to be used in their pure form, because less pure materials which contain traces of growth factors and considerable quantities of mineral nutrients are also suitable for use. When desired, there may be added to the medium mineral salts such as disodium or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium carbonate and the like. If necessary, especially when the culture medium foams seriously a defoaming agent, such as plant oil soy bean oil, linseed oil, etc. , liquid paraffin, fatty oil, higher alcohol octadecanol, tetradecanol, heptanol, etc. , silicone may be added. Submerged aerobic cultural conditions are preferred for the production of FR 900216 substance in massive amounts. For the production in small amounts, a shaking or surface culture in a flask or bottle is employed. Furthermore, when the growth is carried out in large tanks, it is preferable to use the vegetative form of the organism for inoculation in the production tanks in order to avoid growth lag in the process of production of FR 900216 substance. Accordingly, it is desirable first to produce a vegetative inoculum of the organism by inoculating a relatively small quantity of culture medium with spores or mycelia of the organism and culturing said inoculated medium, and then to transfer the cultured vegetative inoculum aseptically to large tanks. The medium, in which the vegetative inoculum is produced, is substantially the same as or different from the medium utilized for the production of the FR 9002l6 substance. Agitation and aeration of the culture mixture may be accomplished in a variety of ways. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment by revolving or shaking the fermentor, by various pumping equipment or by the passage of sterile air through the medium. Agitation may be effected by passing sterile air through the fermentation mixture. The fermentation is usually conducted at a temperature between about 20 C and 40 C, preferably 25 35 C, for a period of about 50 hours to 100 hours. Thus produced FR 9002l6 substance can be recovered from the cultured medium by conventional means which are commonly used for the recovery of other known biologically active substances. The FR 900216 substance may be included in both of filtered broth and cultured mycelia, but, in general, most of FR 9002l6 substance are found in the cultured mycelia. F 900216 substance can be extracted from the cultured mycelia with a solvent such as ethyl acetate and the like. Further, FR 900216 substance can be isolated or purified from thus obtained extract or filtered broth by a conventional manner such as concentration under reduced pressure, extraction with solvent, treatment with resin e.g. anion or cation exchange resin, non ionic adsorption resin , treatment with a conventional adsorbent e.g. activated charcol, silicic acid, silica gel, alumina cellulose, etc. , crystallization, recrystallization, column chromatography using silica gel and the like, liquid column chromatography using silica gel and the like. Thus obtained FR 900216 substance can be converted to the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof by treating it with an acid by a conventional manner. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt of FR 9002l6 substance may include inorganic or organic acid addition salts such as acetic acid salt, lactic acid salt, maleic acid salt, fumaric acid salt, oxalic acid salt, citric acid salt, methanesulfonic acid salt, hydrochloric acid salt, sulfuric acid salt, phosphoric acid salt and the like. The pharmaceutical composition of this invention can be used in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, for example, in solid, semisolid or liquid form, which contains FR 9002l6 substance or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as an active ingredient in admixture with an organic or inorganic carrier or excipient suitable for external, enteral or parenteral applications. The active ingredient may be compounded, for example, with the usual non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for tablets, pellets, capsules, suppositories, solutions emulsions, suspensions, and any other form suitable for use. And, if necessary, in addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening and coloring agents and perfumes may be used. FR 9002l6 substance is included in the pharmaceutical composition in an amount sufficient to produce the desired antitumor effect upon the process or condition of diseases. For applying this composition to human, it is preferably to apply it by intravenous, intramuscular or oral administration.
