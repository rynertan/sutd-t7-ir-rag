## Description
TREATMENT OF ZEOLITES This invention relates to treatment of zeolites to enhance their thermal and hydrothermal stability. Crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites are well known in the art as exemplified by US A 3,702,886 ZSM 5 , 3,709,979 ZSM 11 , and 3,832,449 ZSM 12 . The silica alumina mole ratio of a given zeolite is often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with a silica alumina mole ratio of from 2 to 3 and zeolite Y with such ratio of from 3 to 6. Zeolite ZSM 5 is a crystal line material with a virtually unbounded upper limit of silica alumina mole ratio with a lower limit of at least 5. US A 4,061,724, 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 des cribe microporous crystalline silicas or silicates wherein the aluminum content is present at very low levels. Many of these crystalline materials exhibit either good catalytic activity or adequate thermal or hydrothermal stability, but seldom both good activity and stability. It is known in the art that aluminum ions do not readily exchange into small pore crystalline zeolites by conventional aqueous ion exchange procedures. The pres ent method permits preparation of small pore crystalline materials containing aluminum, at least part of which is cationic, which have high catalytic activity and improved thermal and hydrothermal stability when compared to such materials which have not been treated thereby. US A 3,354,078 and 3,644,220 relate to treating certain crystalline aluminosilicates with volatile metal halides. Neither of these patents is, however, concerned with treatment of crystalline materials having a silica alumina mole ratio of from about 20 to about 200 and exhibiting a cation exchange capacity of from about 0.17 meqlgram to about 1.6 meq gram. The pores of the aluminosilicates treated according to the latter patents are generally much larger than those of the crystalline zeolites to be treated in accordance with the present invention. Other differences will be discussed later. According to the present invention a novel method for improving thermal and hydrothermal stability while providing high catalytic activity of certain zeolites comprises the steps of drying the hydrogen form of the zeolite, contacting the dried zeolite in a dry system with volatile anhydrous aluminum chloride at an elevated temperature, contacting said aluminum chloride contacted material with water vapor under specified conditions and calcining said water vapor contacted material. The resulting crystalline material exhibits catalytic activ ity and enhanced thermal and hydrothermal stability for numerous chemical reactions, such as, for example crack ing of organic, e.g. hydrocarbon, compounds. In order to improve the stability of zeolites, according to the invention, aluminum is desirably incor porated therein. It is believed that hydrated aluminum ions are too large to pass through the pores of these materials. Therefore, conventional ion exchange proced ures will not provide ready exchange of aluminum ions into these materials. The present invention provides the solution to this dilemma. At least a portion of the hydroxylated aluminum species formed in this method is believed to occupy the same positions as hydroxoaluminum cations would after an ion exchange process if it could be conducted. The invention is carried out by drying the hydro gen form of a small pore crystalline material having a silicalalumina mole ratio of from about 20 to about 200, preferably from about 20 to about 100, and exhibiting a total cation exchange capacity of from about 0.17 to about 1.6 meq gram measured by thermogravimetric analysis, preferably from about 0.33 to about 1.6 meqlgram, such as by heating the same at a temperature within the range of about 1000C to 6000C in an anhydrous atmosphere of air, nitrogen, etc. at atmospheric, superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressures for between 1 minute and 48 hours.The dried material is thereafter contacted with anhydrous aluminum chloride vapor in a dry environment at a temperature of from about 1000C to about 8500C, preferably from about 180 C to about 500 C. In fact, a minimum temperature of 1800C is required for this step when conducted at atmospheric pressure. The aluminum chloride contacted crystalline material is then hydrolyzed by contact with water vapor at a temperature of from about 1000C to about 5500C.The water vapor may be carried by a carrier medium such as nitrogen or other inert gas and the pressure will be adjusted to maintain the water as vapor. The hydrolyzed crystalline material is then calcined at a temperature of from about 2000C to about 6000C in an inert atmsophere of air, nitrogen, etc. at subatmospheric, atmospheric or superatmospheric pressures for from about 1 minute to about 48 hours. The anhydrous aluminum chloride contacting step may be accomplished by admixture of the aluminum chloride reagent with a dry inert gas such as nitrogen or air at temperatures ranging from about 1000C to about 8500C, preferably from about 1800C to about 5000C. The amount of aluminum chloride vapor which is utilized is not narrowly critical but usually from about 0.05 to about 0.5 grams of aluminum chloride are used per gram of small pore crystalline starting material. The zeolites contemplated according to the invention include those having pore sizes within the range of from about 4 to about 7 Angstrom Units. By comparison, it is noted that the pores of synthetic faujasite zeolite Y are 8 9 Angstrom Units in size. Dry environment in the aluminum chloride contacting step is limited to an environment or system containing less than 1 mmHg of water. Also, the hydrogen form of the zeolite can be produced by calcining the organic cation containing crystalline material in a conventional manner or by exchange of original cations therein by means known in the art, including contact with ammonium salt solutions or acid solutions followed by washing, drying and calcining. The latter means may involve contacting the crystalline material with an aqueous solution of an ammonium salt, e.g.NH4N03, or an acid, e.g. HCL, for a period of time of from about 1 hour to about 20 hours at a temperature of from about ambient to about 1000C. The ammonium salt used is not narrowly critical and will normally be an in organic salt such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, etc. The acid used will normally be an organic or inorganic acid such as acetic acid, hydro chloric acid, nitric acid, etc. Of the zeolites advantageously treated in accord ance herewith, zeolites ZSM 5, ZSM 11 and ZSM 5 ZSM 11 intermediate are particularly noted. ZSM 5 is described in US A 3,702,886 and Re 29,948. ZSM 11 is described in US A 3,709,979. The ZSM 5 ZSM 11 intermediate is des cribed in US A 4,229,424. Other such crystalline mater ials include zeolites ZSM 12, ZSM 22, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, ZSM 48 and ZSM 50. Zeolite ZSM 12 is described in US A 3,832,449. ZSM 23 is described in US A 4,076,842.

Zeolite ZSM 22 frequently has the composition, in terms of moles of oxides, after dehydration, per 100 moles of silica, as follows x Q20 y MO z Al203 100Si02 wherein Q20 is the oxide form of an organic compound containing an element of Group VA of the Periodic Table of the Etements, e.g. N or P, preferably N, containing at least one alkyl or aryl group having at least 2 carbon atoms, M is an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal having a valence n, and x 0.01 2.0, y 0 2.0 and z 0 5.It is defined by the X ray diffraction pattern shown below Most Significant Lines of Zeolite ZSM 22 d A Relative Intensity I Io 10.9 0.2 M VS 8.7 0.16 W 6.94 0.10 W M 5.40 0.08 W 4.58 0.07 W 4.36 0.07 VS 3.68 0.05 VS d A Relative Intensity I Io 3.62 0.05 S VS 3.47 0.04 M S 3.30 0.04 W 2.74 0.02 W 2.52 0.02 W These values were determined by standard tech niques.

The molar ratio of C2 C12 alkylamine to tetraammonium compound is not usually narrowly critical and can range from 1 1 to 10 1. The tetramethylammonium compound can include the hydroxide or halide with the chloride being particularly preferred. Zeolite ZSM 50 can be identified, in terms of moles of anhydrous oxides per 100 moles of siLica, as follows tO 10 M2xnO 1 5 Al203 100 S 02 wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n, and wherein the zeolite is characterized by a distinctiveX ray diffraction pattern substantially as shown below Significant Lines of Zeolite ZSM 50 d A Relative Intensity, I Io 20.1 .3 W 11.1 .17 S 10.1 .16 M 9.7 .14 W 5.77 .09 W 5.61 .09 W 4.64 .07 M 4.35 .07 M 4.30 .07 VS d A Relative Intensity, I Io 4.00 .06 S 3.85 .06 M 3.70 .06 M 3.42 .05 W 3.35 .05 W 3.27 .05 M 3.24 .05 W 2.94 .04 W 2.53 .04 W These values were determined by standard techniques.The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and an associated computer was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were determined using algorithms in the computer associated with the spectrometer. From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io, where Io is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. the interplanar spacing in AngstromUnits A , corresponding to the recorded lines, were determined. In Table 1, the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols W weak, M medium, S strong and VS very strong. In terms of intensities, these may be generally designated as follows W 0 20 M 20 40 S 40 60 VS 60 100 In the synthesized form, zeolite ZSM 50 has a formula, on an anhydrous basis and in terms of moles of oxides per 100 moles of silica as follows 0 4 R20 OlO M2 nO 1 5 Al203 100 SiO2 wherein M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal, n is the valence of M, and R is an organic cation of a Group VA element of the Periodic Table of the Elements, particularly that derived from a linear diquaternary ammonium, phosphonium, arsonium, stibonium or bismuthonium compound having the general formula CX R 3M Z mM R 3X wherein R is alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, heteroalkyl of from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl of from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, cycloheteroalkyl of from 3 to 9 carbon atoms or combinations thereof M is a quadricoordinate element e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth or a heteroatom e.g.N,O, S, Se, P, As, etc. in an alicyclic, heteroalicyclic or heteroaromatic structure X Is an anion e.g. fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, hydroxide, acetate, sulfate, carboxylate, etc. Z is a bridging member selected from the group consisting of alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkyl of from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, aryl, heteroalkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, heteroalkenyl of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms and heteroaryl, and m is an integer of from about 1 to 10. Zeolite ZSM 50 can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing sources of an alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide, an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon, an organic cation of a Group VA element of the PeriodicTable and water and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the following ranges Reactants Useful Preferred SiO2 AL203 20 100 30 90 OH SOZ 0.1 0.6 0.1 0.3 R S 02 0.05 0.6 0.1 0.3 M S 02 0.01 1.0 0.1 0.6 wherein R and M are as above defined. Crystallization of zeolite ZSM 50 can be carried out at either static or stirred condition in a suitable reactor vessel, such as for example, polypropylene jars or teflon lined or stainless steel autoclaves. The total useful range of temperatures for crystallization is from about 1000C to about 2000C for a time of about 48 hours to about 15 days. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides. Such compositions may include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, a source of aluminum, and an appropriate organic compound containing an element ofGroup VA, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. The stability enhanced crystalline materials prepared by the present method are useful as catalyst components for a variety of organic, e.g. hydrocarbon, compound conversion processes. Such conversion processes include, as non limiting examples, cracking hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 3000C to about 7000C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere bar to about 30 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.1 to about 20 dehydrogenating hydrocarbon compounds with reaction condi tions including a temperature of from about 3000C to about 7000C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.1 to about 20 converting paraffins to aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 1000C to about 7000C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 60 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.5 to about 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 0 to about 20 converting olefins to aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene and xylenes, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 1000C to about 7000C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 60 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.5 to about 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from aboutO to about 20 converting alcohols, e.g. methanol, or ethers, e.g. dimethylether, or mixtures thereof to hydrocarbons including aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 2750C to about 6000C, a pressure of from about 0.5 atmosphere to about 500 atmospheres and a liquid hourly space velocity of from about 0.5 to about 100 isomerizing zylene feedstock components with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 2300C to about 5100C, a pressure of from about 3 atmospheres to about 35 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.1 to about 200 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from aboutO to about 100 disproportionating toluene with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 2000C to about 7600C, a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 60 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.08 to about 20 alkylating aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and alkylbenzenes, in the presence of an alkylating agent, e.g. olefins, formaldehyde, alkyl halides and alcohols, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 3400C to about 5000C, a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 200 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 2 to about 2000 and an aromatic hydrocarbon alkylating agent mole ratio of from about 1 1 to about 20 1 and transalkylating aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 3400C to about 5000C, a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 200 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 10 to about 1000 and an aromatic hydrocarbon polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 1 1 to about 16 1. In practising a particularly desired chemical conversion process, it may be useful to incorporate the above described stability enhanced crystalline material with a matrix comprising another material resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in the process. Such matrix material is useful as a binder and imparts greater resistance to the catalyst for the severe temperature, pressure and reactant feed stream velocity conditions encountered in, for example, many cracking processes. Useful matrix materials are described in ourEP A 1695. The following examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A zeolite having the crystal structure of ZSM 5 was synthesized according to US A 3,702,886 from a reaction mixture containing a source of tetrapropylammonium ions. The crystal product, having a silica alumina mole ratio of 40 and a total cation exchange capacity of 0.8 meqigram was calcined in nitrogen, treated with 0.5 N NH4NQ3, washed with water and dried by calcining in air for 3 hours at 5380C to provide the hydrogen form of zeolite ZSM 5. EXAMPLE 2 About 10 grams of the dried hydrogen form of zeolite ZSM 5 prepared in Example 1 was sized 14 25 mesh and placed in a tube furnace. Anhydrous AlCl3 was positioned in the preheat zone in a glove bag flushed with pre dried nitrogen. The reactor tube was heated at 1500C in a stream of pre dried nitrogen for 16 hours in order to remove any moisture adsorbed on the zeolite. The temperature was then gradually raised to 2000C. The evaporating AlCl3 reacted with the hydrogen zeolite releasing HCl. The temperature was held at 2000C for one hour, then increased to 2500C. When all AlCl3 had disappeared from the preheat zone, the temperature was raised to 5500C and held for three hours in order to desorb physically sorbed All3. The reactor was cooled to ambient temperature and a sample was taken for chemical analysis. This material contained 8.3 wt. X Al203, 4.2 wt. X Cl and 95.4 wt. X ash. The Cl Al atomic ratio was about 1.3 indicating that the introduced aluminum carried between one and two chlorine atoms per aluminum. The data also show that more Al was introduced than was present in the framework. The zeolite remaining in the tube furnace was then heated to 5380C. Dry nitrogen loaded with water vapor by bubbling through water at ambient temperature was then streamed through the tube. The contacting was continued until the effluent gas was neutral. A sample of the product zeolite had the following composition 87.5 wt. X SiO2 8.7 wt. X Al203 0.01 wt. Z Cl Since the framework At203 content for 87.5 wt. X Si02 and a SiO2 Al203 molar ratio of 40 is only 3.7 wt.X, about 5.0 wt. X Al203 was cintroduced to the ZSM 5 by the present method. EXAMPLE 3 In order to confirm improved stability, equal aliquots of the crystalline material produrts of Examples 1 and 2 were evaluated for n hexane cracking act ivity in the Alpha Test both before and after severe steaming for 2 hours at 5930C. The results were as follows Material From Alpha Value Before steaming After steaming Percent decreaseExample 1 267 25 90.6Example 2 230 50 78.2 The Alpha Test is described in The Journal ofCatalysis, Vol. IV, pp. 522 529 August 1965 . It is emphasized that the present invention involves treatment of zeolites having a substantial cation exchange capacity with a silicalalumina mole ratio as low as 20 resulting not necessarily in a higher activity, but in better steam stability. Vapor phase ion exchange is the suspected mechanism of this invention as a means to stabilize the anionic ALO4 sites in the zeolite framework, and reduction of the activity is the normal result of replacing H with Al containing cations. The relatively high Alpha Value found after severe steaming 50 vs 25 demonstrates that such stabilization occurs. However, since more aluminum was introduced than can be explained by ion exchange, it is assumed that, in addition to ion exchange, non cationic aluminum is introduced.The present method employs hydrolysis in the presence of water vapor to reduce the chloride content of the final product crystalline material to less than 0.1 wt. X, e.g. 0.01 wt. X in Example 2 above.
