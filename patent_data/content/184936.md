# Aromatic polysulfone resin compositions.

## Abstract
An aromatic polysulfone resin composition comprises from 30 to 95 by weight of an aromatic polysulfone and from 5 to 70 by weight of a potassium titanate fiber having a free potassium content of not more than 0.25 by weight. The polysulfone may contain ether and or isopropylidene link ages. The composition has improved heat resistance, strength, rigidity and, in particular, does not undergo gelation during melting.
