# Electronic circuitry operable with low supply voltage.

## Abstract
An output section of an electronic circuitry having a differential amplifier Q₁, Q₂, Q₃, Q₄ and a variable gain amplifier Q₅, Q₆ as a fundamental circuit is connected to the emitter of a first transistor Q₁₄ having an inverted conduc tivity type to that of transistors constituting the electronic circuitry and to the collector of a second transitor Q₁₃ in combination with the first transistor Q₁₄ to constitute an inverted Darlington amplifier. The output current is derived from the emitter of the second transistor Q₁₃ , so that the electronic circuitry can be operated under the application of a low supply voltage and suited for an integration circuit.
