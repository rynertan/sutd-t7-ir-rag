# Light source in an optical communications system.

## Abstract
A double heterostructure semiconductor laser having the configuration of its optical cavity arranged to impose a constraint on the lasing filament as the spatial distribution of the lasing filament changes from that occuring at the start of the lasing regime, so that the optical flux emitted by the laser has self saturating properties. This protects the laser from catastrophic facet erosion and enables a simpler control circuit to be used to drive this laser when it is used as a light source for an optical communications system.
