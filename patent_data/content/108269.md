# A method of causing sedimentation of sedimentary solid material transported in a body of water, such as a lake, a sea, or an ocean.

## Abstract
In a sea or a lake or another body of water, sedimenta tion 12, 35, 50 of sedimentary solid material may be obtained in desired areas by reducing the hydraulic pressure in the sea floor or lake bottom layer in the said area. Such reduction of the hydraulic pressure causes water to flow from the lake or sea into the porous bottom or floor layer whereby material suspended in the water or transported along the bed settles on the floor or bottom. The reduction of the hydraulic pressure is obtained by pumping water from underground drain tubes 10, 14 or other drainage devices 21 extending along and adjacent to the coastline 9. The method may be used for coast protection and reclamation of land.
