# Direct keyboard controlled character selection rack shifting device for a single element typewriter.

## Abstract
Device for shifting a bifurcated character selection rack 12 between a first position and a second position, thereby engaging alternate portions 14, 16 of the rack with a pinion 18 controlling the rotation of the typehead 10 of a typewriter. The rack shifting mechanism 58, 60, 46, 32 is controlled by a direct link 62 to the keyboard of the typewriter which responds to movement of a shift key lever. The mechanism performs a force multiplication and, at the same time, a displacement division function to reduce a relatively large keylever and link displacement to a relatively small rack displacement. The rack shifting mechanism translates the rack to engage the alternate rack portion with pinion 18 thereby reversing the rotation of the pinion and allowing characters to be selected from the opposite hemisphere of the type element in response to a character selection input.
