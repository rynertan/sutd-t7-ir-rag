# A device for the transfer of one or more substances between a gas and a liquid.

## Abstract
Device for the transfer of one or more substances between a gas and a fluid, the gas being introduced into the fluid in the form of bubbles, from which the said substances are transferred to the fluid, whereupon the excess gas is removed together with any substances transferred from the fluid to the gas. The device comprises an annular heat and gas exchange chamber 11 designed for vertical placing and having a gas inlet 20 at the lower end of this chamber and with a heat exchanger 12 arranged above this inlet. The device is characterized in that the heat and gas exchange chamber 11 is terminated at the top by a number of throttling parts 29a distributed evenly around the periphery. The device in accordance with the invention is intended in the first place to be used for the oxygenation of blood, that is to say an oxygenator, whereby the said fluid being consti tuted of blood and the said gas being constituted of oxygen or an oxygen mixture from which oxygen is transferred to the blood and to which carbon dioxide is transferred from the blood.
