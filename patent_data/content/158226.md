## Description
METHOD OF SYNTHESIZING ESTERS 1. INTRODUC ION The present invention relates to the preparation of novel ester compounds useful in assaying a test sample for the presence of analytes such as leukocyte cells, esterase and protease. The invention is particularly useful in detecting leukocyte levels in body fluids such as urine, and reduces the laboratory procedure for such assay from a cumbersome counting procedure requiring microscopic observation, to a rapid, facile dip and read operation. The presence of an abnormally high level of leukocytes in a patient s urine is possibly indicative of such pathological conditions as kidney or urogenital tract infection or other dysfunction. Accordingly, accurate urinary leukocyte information can be an invaluable tool to the physician in diagnosis and treatment of such pathologies. Traditionally, the medical profession has relied on visual determination techniques to count leukocyte population in urine sediment or uncentrifuged urine, a process requiring expensive equipment such as a centrifuge and microscope, as well as inordinate time expenditure on the part of the clinician. Moreover, the traditional techniques suffer from the disadvantage that only intact cells are determined. Leuko cotes occurring in the urinary system are subject to cGlvditions which can favor extensive cell lysis. For example, it is known that in urines of abnormally high pH, leukocyte half life can be as low as 60 minutes.Sine lysed cells escape detection in visual examination techniques, erroneously low determinations and false negatives can result. Of the two techniques of microscopic leukocyte analysis urine sediment and non centrifuged, homogenized urine the former is clearly the most desirable. Although dependable results can inure to the latter, urine sediment observation is used in an overwhelming majority of instances. It requires that the urine sample be centrifuged and the sediment isolated and subjected to microscopic inspection. The analyst then counts the number of leukocytes appearing in the viewing field. This task is further complicated by the presence of other urinary components in the sediment such as epithelial cells and salt particles. The varying content of sediment constituents, coupled with other complicating factors including nonhomogeneity of the sample and differing optical powers among microscope equipment, can lead to enormous errors in the ultimate determination. It is thus apparent that a quick, facile method of leukocyte determination, one which would eliminate the need for tile consuming techniques, as well as cost consuming equipment, and which would provide accurate responses to esterase, protease or leukocyte cells, whether the cells are intact or lysed, would indeed constitute a quantum advance in the state ofthe art. The present invention provides such an advance. Moreover, it is based, not on the ability to see leukocytes, but on the enzymatic activity they exhibit, and therefore is substantially free of the inaccuracies described above. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Traditionally, esterification reactions between acyl halides and alcohols or phenols to form esters are carried out in basic media. This is primarily to neutralize the halogen acid HC1, HF, HBr, etc. formed by the esterification, thus shifting the equilibrium in favor of the formation of the ester. In the case where it is desirable to prepare esters of amino alcohols, however, it has been necessary to substitute the amino moiety with an N blocking group, such as acetyl, tosyl or tert butyloxycarbonyl.Otherwise the compound becomes acylated both at the hydroxyl and the amine groups. Moreover where the compound is an enolic alcohol o acylation is hampered by the keto form, and side reactions on the more nucleophilic functional groups are likely to occur. 3. SUMMARY OF HE INVENTION Briefly stated, the present invention comprises a method for preparing an ester having the structureEMI3.1 in which A is an acid residue R, same or different is H, lower alkyl, aryl, or in which both of R together form a ring structure, and R is H, lower alkyl or aryl.The method comprises combining a first compound having the structure EMI4.1 and a second compound which is an acyl halide corresponding to A, said combining being performed in the presence of an organic acid. 4. DEFINITIONS The following definitions are provided to clarify the scope of the present invention, and to enable its formulation and use. 4.1 The expression acid residue includes derivative structures of ester forming acids without their characteristic acidic OH group. Thus, the term includes the acids phosphoric, sulfonic, carbonic and carboxylic, i.e.,EMI4.2 in which R is defined above. The expressions N blocked amino acid residue and N blocked peptide residue requires definition on two counts. N blocked refers to the chemistry of the amine group of an amino acid or peptide whereby a hydrogen bound to the nitrogen atom is replaced by a protective group such as acetyl, p toluene sulfonyl tosyl and tert butyloxycarbonyl t BOC and other Nprotective groups known in the art. By the expressions amino acid residue and peptide residue is meant an amino acid or peptide molecule without the OH of its carboxyl group. 4.2 By the expression aryl is meant any ring system containing aromaticity. Included by the expression are such 5 and 6 membered rings as pyrrole, phenyl, and pyridyl, as well as fused ring systems such as naphthyl. Thus, the aromatic ring system can be heterocyclic or homocyclic, and can be substituted or unsubstituted, provided the substituent groups s not interfere with ability of composition to hydrolyze in the presence of leukocyte cells, esterase or pro tease. Selection of such substituents is a routine laboratory determination, given the present disclosure. 4.3 The expression lower alkyl , as used in the present disclosure, is an alkyl moiety containing about 1 6 carbon atoms. Included in the meaning of lower alkyl are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, nbutyl, sec butyl, tert butyl and all isomers of pentyl and hexyl. These can be unsubstituted, or they can be substituted provided any such substituents not interfere with the operation or functioning of the presently claimed composition or test device in its capability to detect leukocyte cells, esterase or protease. 4.4 The acyl halides used in the method of the present invention correspond to A, above. For example, acyl halides included can be sulfonyl chloride, carboxyl chloride, phosphonyl chloride and N tosyl Lalaninyl chloride. The preferred halide is chloride. 5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generically to esterification of compounds having the structureEMI6.1 wherein R and R are as defined above. Included are pyrrole, indole, pyridyl and 2 amino ketones. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted should assure the stability of the reactants as well as the product, and thus can be routinely determined on a case by case basis. When the starting material, for example, is indoxyl or 3 hydroxy 5phenylpyrrole, the preferred temperature range is about 30 C to room temperature. Ideally the reaction is run at about 50C for indoxyl and about O C for the pyrrole. Solvents used for the esterification are nonaqueous, and should be relatively free of trace water.Included as preferred solvents are tetrahydrofuran THF , methylene chloride, chloroform, acetone, diethyl ether, and benzene. The solvent most preferred isTHF. Other reagents which effect the reaction cataly tically can also be employed. illustrative of these are pyridine, and 2,6 lutidine and other weak organic bases. Materials which assure anbydrous conditions, such as anhydrous MgSO4 and molecular sieves can also be added to the reaction mixture. The organic acid which is an essential part of the invention process possesses wide latitude in its definition. It includes alkanoic acids, substituted alkanoic acids, aromatic carboxylic acids and substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. Specific compounds included within the scope of organic acid include trifluoroacetic, oxalic, citric, acetic, benzoic, 2,4 dinitrobenzoic methane sulfonic and the like. 6.
