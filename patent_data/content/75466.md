# Conductivity detector and method.

## Abstract
A conductivity detector for use in chromatography sys tems which provides digital processing of a conductivity signal to provide improved stability. The detector compares a trial offset signal with a detected conductivity signal and when the compared values are within a predetermined value the detector processes the compared value and the final offset value, thereby providing an improved accuracy with higher resolution.
