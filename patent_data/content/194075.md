# Switching power supply.

## Abstract
A switching power supply that comprises a base drive transformer, a switch device connected to one end of the transformer s primary winding, and a transistor having its base connected to one end of the secondary winding and its emitter connected to the other end of the secondary winding, also comprises a current dependent voltage clamp connected across one winding of the transformer. The clamp circuit prevents the voltage across the primary winding from ex ceeding a predetermined value so long as the magnetizing cur rent that flows in the primary winding when the switch device is opened does not exceed a predetermined value.
