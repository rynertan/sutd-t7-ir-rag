## Description
TITLE CRYSTALLINE SALTS This invention relates to crystalline salts of an antibacterial cephalosporin derivative. In European Patent Publication 31708, Example 19, there is described the preparation of 7 imidazol2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethylceph 3 em4 carboxylic acid. This compound, both in the form of its common acid addition salts and in the form of free acid free base zwitterion , is non crystalline.However, it has now been discovered that certain base addition salts can be obtained in crystalline form. According to the invention there is provided a crystalline base addition salt of 7 imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethylceph 3 em 4carboxylic acid in which the base is selected from Nmethylpiperidine, N ethylpiperidine, triethylamine orN ethylmorpholine. The crystalline salt of the invention is particularly useful for aiding the final purification of the cephalosporin derivative. Thus in one easy step the purity of the cephalosporin derivative can be raised from about 90 or less to nearly 100 avoiding the need for extensive chromatography. In addition the cephalosporin derivative exhibits improved stability in the crystalline salt form. A particularly useful salt is that formed with triethylamine. According to a further feature of the invention there is a provided a process for the manufacture of the crystalline salts described above.The process is characterised by addition of N methylpiperidine, N ethylpiperidine, triethylamine or N ethyl morpholine to a suspension, partial solution or solution of 7 imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2.3 triazol 4 yl thio methylceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid, either in the free acid free base zwitterionic form, or in the form of an acid addition salt, in a diluent or solvent. A particular diluent or solvent is acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, methanol or water, or a mixture of any two or three of these. The preferred diluent or solvent is dimethylformamide. The cephalosporin derivative and the base are preferably both in solution before crystallisation occurs. Alternatively it may be necessary to filter the mixture before crystallisation occurs, and it may also be necessary to concentrate the solution to induce crystallisation.Crystallisation of the salt generally takes place at ambient temperature, though it may be necessary to cool the mixture, for example to 0 10 C, preferably 4 5 , to induce crystallisation and or improve the yield of crystalline product. The crystalline salt of the invention may be used in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral administration, for which purposes it may be formulated by means known to the art into the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders, suppositories and sterile injectable aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions. In addition to the crystalline salt of the invention the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain, or be co administered with, one or more known drugs selected from other clinically useful antibacterial agents for example other i lactams or aminoglycosides , inhibitors of B lactamase for example clavulanic acid , renal tubular blocking agents e.g. probenicid and inhibitors of metabolising enzymes for example inhibitors of peptidases, for example Z 2 acylamino 3 substituted propenoates . A preferred pharmaceutical composition of the invention is one suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, for example a sterile injectable containing between 1 and 5 w w of the crystalline salt, or one suitable for oral administration in unit dosage form, for example a tablet or capsule which contains between 50mg. and 200mg. of the crystalline salt. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention will normally be administered to man in order to combat infections caused by bacteria, in the same general manner as that employed for cep nalothin, cefoxitin, cephradine and other known clinically used cephalosporin derivatives, due allowance being made in terms of dose levels for the potency of the crystalline salt of the present invention relative to the known clinically used cephalosporins. Thus each patient will receive a daily intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of 50mg. to 500mg. and preferably 100mg. to 200mg., of the crystalline salt, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day.The intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular dose will be given by means of a bolus injection.Alternatively the intravenous dose may be given by continuous infusion over a period of time.Alternatively each patient will receive a daily oral dose which is approximately equivalent to the daily parenteral dose. Thus a preferred daily oral dose is 100mg. to lg., and preferably 200mg. to 400mg., of the crystalline salt, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times, and preferably twice, per day. The preferred route of administration is oral. The invention is illustrated, but not limited by the following Examples Example 1 To a suspension of 7 imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethylceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid European Patent Publication 31708, Example 19 0.416 g. 91 strength in acetonitrile 10 ml. and methanol 10 ml. at ambient temperature was added Nethylpiperidine 0.137 ml. , to give a partial solution. The suspended solid was removed by filtration, and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 5 ml. The solution was stored at 40C for 17 hours. The crystalline solid which had formed was collected, washed with methanol and then acetonitrile and dried under reduced pressure to give the crystalline N ethylpiperidine salt 40 as fine colourless non hygroscopic needles, m.p. 18Q C. decomp. , purity estimated by HPLC 99.4 .Example 2 The process described in Example 1 was repeated, using triethylamine 0.14 ml. in place ofN ethylpiperidine. There was thus obtained the corresponding triethylamine salt 71 , as colourless, non hygroscopic needles, m.p. 165 C decomp. , purity estimated by HPLC 99.1 . This salt can be recrystallised from water.Example 3 To a solution of 7 imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethylceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid 0.595 g., 84.4 strength in DMF 5 ml. was added triethylamine 0.2 ml. and the resulting clear solution was stirred at ambient temperature to allow crystallisation to occur. After 30 minutes the resulting crystals were collected by filtration, washed with DMF 1.5 ml. , then acetonitrile, and dried at room temperature under reduced pressure to give the crystalline triethylamine salt 91 as fine colourless non hygroscopic needles, m.p. 165 decomp , purity estimated by HPLC 97.78 with 0.99 water KarlFischer .Example 4 The process described in Example 3 was repeated, using N methylpiperidine in place of triethylamine. There was thus obtained the corresponding crystalline N methylpiperidine salt 49 as fine colourless non hygroscopic needles, m.p. 185 C decomp. , purity estimated by HPLC 100 with 0.6 water Karl Fischer .Example 5 7 Imidazol 2 yl amino 3 lH 1,2,3 triazol 4 yl thiomethylceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid 5g. 95.9 strength was added gradually to a stirred solution ofN ethylmorpholine 2.3ml. in water 7.5ml. making sure that each aliquot had dissolved before the next was added. The resulting clear yellow solution was scratched to initiate crystallisation and the mixture was stored at 40C. for 1 hour to permit crystallisation to take place. Methanol 42.5ml. was then added in 5ml. aliquots over 2 hours with stirring, the temperature of the suspension being maintained at 40C. The resulting crystalline suspension was stirred at 40C. for a further 30 minutes and the crystals were collected by filtration, washed with methanol 5ml. followed by acetonitrile 2 x 5ml. and dried over P205 under reduced pressure to give the crystalline N ethylmorpholine salt 53.6 as fine colourless non hygroscopic needles, m.p. 195 C decomp. , purity estimated by HPLC 98.5 with 1.788 water KarlFischer .
