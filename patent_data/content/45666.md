# Holders for photographic slides.

## Abstract
A holder 10 for photographic slides which is normally in a rectilinear condition in which it can be contained in a box. The holder includes a flexible element 12 which has connecting portions 18, 20 at each end thereof. A tongue 28 associated with the portion 18 co operates with a tongue associated with the portion 20 and the portion 18 co operates with a flange 34 to secure the holder into the form of a closed loop. A unit 14 is attached to the element 12 and to the portions 18,20 and forms a series of pockets 54 each of which serves to receive a photographic slide. From the holder 10 the slides are transferred directly to the pockets of a slide magazine for projection. The holder 10 , when straight, occupies less space that a rotary projector magazine and is far less expensive to produce.
