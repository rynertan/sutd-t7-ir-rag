## Description
N ACYL 6 AM8INOPENICILLANIC ACID DERIVATIVES, THEIR USE AS ss LACTAMASE DEACTIVATORS, AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND S LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS. This invention relates to N acyl 6 aminopenicllanic acid derivatives, some of which are novel per se, to their use as ss lactamase deactivators, and to compositions containing them and ss lactam antibiotics. The resistance of certain bacteria to ss lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins is frequently due to B lactamases, bacerial enzymes which catalyse the rapid hydrolysis of the ss lactam ring of the antibiotics. One approach to the problem of overcoming this resistance has been to use antibiotics which, because of their structure, are poor substrates for the hydrolytic bacterial enzymes. The cephamycins disclosed by Nagarajan et al, J.A.C.S. 93 1971 2308 2310, are such hydrolysisresistant antibiotics. Another approach has been to use a ss lactamase deactivator which is itself not an effective antibiotic, in conjunction with an antibiotic, to protect the antibiotic from hydrolysis. One such deactivator is clavulanic acid, disclosed by Howarth et al, J.S. Chem. Conunun. 1976 276 277 Reading et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.ll 1977 952 857 and Dumon et al, Antimicrob. AgentsChemother. 15 1979 315 317. Other compounds which deactivate bacterial hydrolytic enzymes are some carbapenam compounds such as, for example, PS 5 disclosed byOkamura et al, J. Antibiotics 31 1978 480 482and the olivanic acid derivatives disclosed by Brown et al, J.C.S. Chem. Commun. 1977 953 954 and Maeda et al, J. Antibiotics 30 1977 770 773. Clavulanic acid and the carbapenams have all been isolated from natural sources. Synthetic compounds have also been used to deactivate e lactamases. Examples are 66 bromo des amino penicillanic acid disclosed by Pratt et al, Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75 1978 4145 4149 and Knott Ilunziker et al, Biochem. J. 177 1979 365 367 6 des aminopenicillanic acid sulfone CP 45899 of formula IEMI2.1 disclosed by English et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 14 1978 414 419 and Belgian Patent Specification No. 867,859 and 6 chloro des aminopenicillanic acid sulfone disclosed by Cartwright et al, Nature 278 1979 360 361. Methicillin sulfone, of formula IIEMI2.2 is disclosed by Johnson et al, J. Org. Chem. 28 1963 1927, but no utility is ascribed to this compound therein. According to the present invention, N acyl derivatives of 6 aminopenicillanic acid sulfone whose corresponding N acyl derivative of 6 aminopenicillanic acid has a rate constant cat of not more than 100, preferably not more than 25, seconds 1, are of utility as ss lactamase deactivators and can be used for that purpose in animals being treated with a ss lactam antibiotic. The N acyl 6 aminopenicillanic acid sulfones can be administered to any animal, including humans, with a bacterial infection, either alone, if the patient is being treated with a ss lactam antibiotic, or i admixture with a B lactam a.,xlDiotic. In either case, if desired, a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carrier substance may be used. The relative proportions of the sulfone and the antibiotic administered to the patient or present in the mixture may be from 1 100 to 100 1 by weight, depending on specific circumstances. The dosage consequently can vary over a wide range depending upon the dosage of the desired ss lactam antibiotic, which conventionally ranges from 50 mg to 1 g per kg body weight.Administration can be oral, intravenous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal, or by any other medically recognised method. When administered with a carrier, an effective amount of the active agent should be present in the carrier to provide the desired dosage. Any carrier will usually be a solid or a sterile liquid. It has been discovered that, after the administration of certain ss lactamase deactivators, including CP 45s99 and the compounds used in the present invention, intermediates are formed which are covalently attached to the lactamases. It is believed that these acyl enzyme intermediates either deacylate resulting in the undesirable restoration of the lactamase or fragment resulting in the desirable deactivation of the lactamase . Since fragmentation occurs in competition with deacylation, the number of fragmentations, and hence the effectiveness of the deactivator, can be increased by increasing the life span of the acyl enzyme intermediates.This can be achieved by employing an N acyl derivative of 6 aminopenicillanic acid sulfone in which the corresponding N acyl derivative of 6 aminopenicillanic acid is a very poor substrate for B lactamase. Since the rate constant cat of an N acyl derivative of 6 aminopenicillanic acid. is a measure of its ability to act as a substrate, this constant provides the basis for defining the class of sulfones used in the present invention. Preferred derivatives for use in the invention are the knobs compound methicillin sulfone and the novel compounds quinacillin sulfoneEMI4.1 and cloxacillin sulfoneEMI4.2 The N acyl derivatives of 6 aminopenicillanic acid sulfone are synthesised by oxidising the appropriateN acyl derivatives of 6 aminopenicillanic acid with aqueous permanganate, according to the procedure described by Johnson et al, J. Org. Chem. 28 1963 1927. For example, quinacillin sulfone is prepared by oxidising quinacillin with aqueous permanganate. The following Table indicates the comparative efficacies of the four compounds CP 45899, methicillin sulfone, quinacillin sulfone and cloxacillin sulfone, based on the in vitro treatment of E. coli RTEM ss lactamase. In the Table, t kcat11 is the rate constant of the corresponding N acyl derivative of penicillanic acid t, is the time taken for the activity of the ss lactamase 2 to be halved Turnovers represents the number of turnovcrs before inactivation, i.e. the number of molecules of the compounds needed to inactivate one ss lactamase molecule.

The effectiveness of quinacillin sulfone is shown in that both the inactivation time and the number of turnovers before inactivation are low. The Table shows that methicillin sulfone and cloxacillin sulfone are also effective deativating agents although less effective than quinacillin sulfone.
