# Burner for sintering machine.

## Abstract
This improved ignition device for a moving grate type sintering machine is an inexpensive, compact combustion device which can form a strip of flame extending uniformly and continuously over the width of the strand. This ignition device can provide a uniform ignition intensity, and the ignition conditions of the raw mix can be controlled optimal ly by moving the burner Bb and a hood 24 therefor vertically and or rotatably in accordance with the operational conditions of the sintering process. The ignition device thus contributes to prevent the sintered ore from being unevenly sintered, and to save heating energy.
