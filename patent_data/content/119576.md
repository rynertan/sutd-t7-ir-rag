# Method for making aromatic etherimides.

## Abstract
A method for making aromatic ether imides is provided by effecting the displacement of reactive radicals on a phthali mide nucleus with a mono or bis alkali metal phenoxide in the presence of a nonpolar solvent and a phase transfer catalyst, such as a triorganoborate. The aromatic ether imide made by the present invention are useful intermediates for making aro matic ether anhydrides and aromatic bis ether anhydrides .
