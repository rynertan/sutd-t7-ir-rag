## Description
STABILIZATION OF TETRAHYDROFOLIC ACID AND SERINE HYDROXYMETHYLTRANSFERASE IN REACTION MIXTURES FOR THE ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS OF L SERINE Background of the InventionField of the Invention The present invention relates to improving the efficiency of enzymatic synthesis of L serine.Description of the Background Art The amino acid L serine is a valuable commercial product that is employed in hyperalimentation and nutritional compositions and is also used as an intermediate or starting material in certain synthetic processes. There is thus a demand for L serine, and various processes have been developed for producing it, including fermentation,.chem ical synthesis and enzymatic synthesis. One method of enzymatic synthesis of L serine involves reacting glycine and formaldehyde in the presence of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the co factor tetrahydrofolic acid see copending U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 442,962 . While this method has proven efficient from a production standpoint relative to certain other prior processes, there are special problems that must be addressed while using this process. Tetrahydrofolate sometimes referred to as THF is very sensitive to oxidation by oxygen in air and serine hydroxymethyl transferase sometimes referred to as SHMT is sensitive to inactivation by formaldehyde. It is an object of this invention to provide a method of stabilizing THF and SHMT under reaction conditions for the enzymatic synthesis of L serine, and to thereby improve the efficiency of the process. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of stabilizing tetrahydrofolic acid and serine hydroxymethyltransferase in a reaction mixture for the enzymatic synthesis of serine which comprises adding to the reaction mixture a stabilizing amount of a reducing agent or mixture of reducing agents, and a high concentration of THF relative to a catalytic amount. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of stabilizing tetrahydrofolic acid and serine hydroxymethyltransferase in a reaction mixture for the enzymatic synthesis ofL serine by the addition to the reaction mixture a reducing agent or mixture of reducing agents, and appropriate amount of THF. Enzymatic synthesis of t serine from glycine and for maldehyde generally requires the presence of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the cofactor tetrahydrofolic acid. Formaldehyde reacts with TRF to form methylene THF. Glycine then reacts with methylene THF in the presence of SHMT to form L serine and regenerate THF.The synthesis advantageously takes place in a reaction vessel, for example, a stirred tank reactor, with the reaction mixture at a temperature of from about 40C to about 60 C and at a pH of from about 4 to about 11. High speed of agitation of the mixture is required to facilitate the dispersion of HCHO. Serine hydroxymethyltransferse SHMT is very sensitive to formaldehyde. Formaldehyde HCHO at low concentration can quickly inactivate SHMT enzyme. Since formaldehyde is one of reactants necessary to make serine from glycine, a method to prevent SHMT inactivation by formaldehyde is needed to have a successful process. THF is a cofactor for SHMT in the reaction therefore, a catalytic amount of THF would normally be enough to carry reaction. THF is recycled in the reaction, snown in the following scheme.HCHO THFEMI3.1 methylene THFEMI3.2 tb SEP SHMT tb SEP methylene THF SEP SEP gly SEP H SEP Ser SEP SEP Tl1F SEP tb Net SEP reaction SEP HCHO SEP SEP Gly SEP SEP serine tb The process of the present invention takes advantage of the high affinity of THF for HCHO Keq 3 x 104 . In the process of the present invent ion, THF is used to consume HCHO in order to prevent HCHO from inactivating theSHMT. Therefore, a THF concentration higher than catalytic amount is employed to prevent enzyme inactivation by HCHO.The THF is added in a concentration range between 0.01 mM to 50 mM with a preferred range between 0.1 mM and 5 mM. It has been discovered that excess THIF coupled with a formaldehyde addition rate which is rate limiting for the overall reaction prevents formaldehyde accumulation and thus SHMT inactivation. Accordingly, formaldehyde is preferably added to the reaction mixture at a rate less than or equal to the rate at which it is consumed in the reaction. The precise rate of addition will vary with the reaction conditions and amount of THF present. The rate of addition can easily be adjusted by monitoring the buildup of formaldehyde in the reaction medium. Tetrahydrofolic acid is very unstable under reaction conditions and in the presence of oxygen. A preferred method of preventing oxygen contact with the reaction mixture is by the induced presence of a non reacting gas in the reaction vessel. Particularly preferred non reacting gases are nitrogen and argon. Since a high rate of agitation is required for the reaction, it is extremely difficult to maintain an 02 free environment. If THF is oxidized by air, the protection of SHdT from HCHO by reaction with THF no longer exists. The SHMT is generally in the reaction mixture in the form of purified enzyme, crude extract or contained in whole cells of microorganisms which have been transformed with expression vectors containing DNA sequences encoding the amino acid sequence of SHMT, under the control of regulatory sequences which direct the expression of SHMT.The instability of THF and thus SHMT under reaction conditions limits the efficiency of the enzymatic process for L serine synthesis. It has been discovered that the presence in the reaction mixture of a reducing agent or a mixture of reducing agents stabilizes tetrahydrofolic acid and thus serine hydroxymethyltransferase under reaction conditions, without inhibiting the enzymatic process. This stabilizing effect on THF and SHMT is enhanced by prevention of air contact with the reaction mixture. Any reducing agent may be employed which does not deleteriously affect the reaction process. Preferred reducing agents are ascorbic acid, thioglycolate and thioalcohols, including mercaptans, e.g., 1,3 dimercaptopropan2 ol, 2,3 dimercaptopropanol, 1 ,2 dimercaptoethane, dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol, and mercaptoethanol, Lthiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid as well as amionethylisothiouronium bromide. Particularly preferred reducing compounds are mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol and thioglycolate. 2 mercaptoethanol is most preferred. The concentration of the reducing agent or agents in the reaction mixture is preferably in the range of from about 0.01M to about 0.2M, most preferably from about 0.02M to about 0.7M, The reducing agent or agents are added to the reaction mixture at the beginning of the reaction, continuously during the reaction, or at the beginning of the reaction and periodically during the reaction. Preferably the reducing agent or agents are added to the reaction mixture at the beginning of the reaction and perioHic3zUyw th ere after during the reaction. The reducing agent is added in an amount which stabilizes the THF and the SHMT in the reaction mixture.Generally, an amount of reducing agent sufficient to maintain the redox potential of the reation mixture at between 300mV and 500mV will stablize the THF and the SHMT. The redox potential can be monitored by a redox probe and maintained within the range of about 300mV to about 350mV by selective titration of the reducing agent or agents into the reaction mixture. If desired, this can be done by means of an automated feedback system which will monitor the redox potential and add reducing agent as necessary during the reaction. It is particularly preferred to maintain the redox potential at about 300 mV. Typically, the process of the invention is carried out in the following manner. Glycine, THF and formaldehyde are charged to a reaction vessel in a suitable reaction solvent, together with an initial portion of reducing agent, such as 2 mercaptoethanol, and mixed under a nitrogen blanket. SHMT is then added, for example in the form of whole transformed cells in which the SHMT has been expressed. Preferably, the cell walls tare been ruptured in order to allow contact between the expressed enzyme in the cells and the reactants in the reaction medium. This can be achieved by contacting the transformant cells with a detergent such as cetylpyridinium chloride, Triton X 100,Tween 100, NP40 or solvent such as toluene or acetone. The redox potential is continuously monitored with a probe and maintained at about 300 mV by the addition of reducing agent until the reaction is complete. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. Example 1 Tetrahydrofolate 10 mM in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 which was degassed by bubbling N2 through for 10 minutes was mixed with various concentrations of 2mercaptoethanol. This solution was kept in a serum bottle at room temperature, sealed with a rubber stopper and protected from light by aluminum foil. After 20 hours, tetrahydrofolate was totally degraded in the presence of 10 mM mercaptoethanol. About 40 of the tetrahydrofolate was left when 50 mM 2 mercaptoethanol was used. 2Mercaptoethanol at 100 mM stabilized tetrahydrofolic acid for 16 hours under unstirred conditions. Methylene tetrahydrofolate was formed by mixing tetrahydrofolate with two equivalents of CHO for 15 minutes at room temperature. The stability test on methylene tetrahydrofolic acid which is identical to the one for tetrahydrofoli c acid described above indicated that 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, is enough to stabilize methylene tetrahydrofolic acid for 20 hours. Example 2 Tetrahydrofolate 10 mM in 50 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 which had been degassed by bubbling N2 through for 10 minutes was mixed with 2mercaptoethanol 100 mM, final concentration at 37 C. A stream of N2 gas was maintained over the tetrahydrofolate solution which was under continuous stirring. After 20 hours, both of tetrahydrofolate and methylene tetrahydrofolate were stable. Example 3 Serine hydroxymethyltransferase crude extract from E.coli strain Gx1703 containing pGx122, deposited as NRRL No.B 15215 in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 was mixed with various concentrations of 2 mercaptoethanol at 37 C and under shaking. The enzyme activity was assayed by two methods described below. 1 phenylserine assay An appropriate amount of enzyme was mixed with 30 mM phenylserine solution in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 containing 50 m pyridoxal 5 phosphate at 30 C. A reading of absorbance at 279 was used to indicate enzyme activity. 2 Glycine Serine assay An appropriate amount of enzyme was mixed with 10 mM glycine, HCHO and tetrahydrofolate in 0.1 M potassium phosphate at 8.0. Serine produced at different time intervals was determined by HPLC. Results of both assays indicated that serine hydroxymethyltransferase was stable in the presence of 0.05 M, 0.1 M or 0.2 M 2 mercaptoethanol for 3 days when compared to the same enzyme activity in the absence of 2 mercaptoethanol. Example 4 A reaction mixture containing 2 M glycine and 0.5 mM pyridoxal 5 phosphate had been degassed by bubbling through N2 gas for 10 minutes before the addition of tetrahydrofolate 2 mM . The pH was maintained at 6.5 by automatic addition of potassium hydroxide 10 N . Redox potential was monitored by redox electrode and maintained by automatic addition of 2 mercaptoethanol 4 N and a stream of N2 gas over the constantly stirred tetrahydrofolate solution. The level of tetrahydrofolate was followed by HPLC.Results are shown. a.
