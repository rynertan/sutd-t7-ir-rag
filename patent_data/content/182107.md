# A method for reducing baseline error components in NMR signals.

## Abstract
A method for reducing baseline errors in NMR signals utilizes NMR signals produced by RF excitation pulses selected to be 180 out of phase relative to one another to derive a baseline error signal. The baseline error signal is then used to compensate for baseline error component in other NMR signals. In the preferred embodiment, the meth od is useful in NMR imaging pulse sequences to not only achieve compensation of the baseline error, but also to shorten scan time.
