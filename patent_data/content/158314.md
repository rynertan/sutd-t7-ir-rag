# Video display control system.

## Abstract
A video display control system is capable of moving a part of a still image from a first display area to a second display area on a screen. The video display control system includes a memory composed of a plurality of memory lo cations for storing a plurality of display data representative of images of display elements on the screen. First and second registers retain first and second area data representative of the first and second display areas and an address data gen erator generates from these area data first and second ad dress data, the first address data, indicating memory locations which store display data corresponding to the first display area, the second address data indicating second memory locations which store display data corresponding to the sec ond display area. A reading circuit reads the display data in the first memory locations in accordance with the first ad dress data, while a writing circuit writes the read display data into the second memory locations in accordance with the second address data. The video display control system fur ther includes another reading circuit and an operation circuit This reading circuit reads the display data in the second mem ory locations and feeds the ready display data to the oper ation circuit which effects an operation such as a logical operation or a transparency processing on each pair of the display data read from the first and second memory loca tions.
