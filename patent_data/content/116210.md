# Optical lens moving mechanism.

## Abstract
An optical lens moving mechanism for zoom lens systems using a plane cam is disclosed. A lens system having an optical axis comprises at least two lens groups. A first lens holder and a second lens holder which respectively hold the two lens groups are moved along a guide parallel with the optical axis by a rotational movement of the plane cam which moves on a plane parallel with the optical axis, to zoom the lens system. The mechanism further includes a zooming motor, a position detector and a controller to control the rotation of the motor according to the zooming position of the lens system, to achieve a uniform zooming speed.
