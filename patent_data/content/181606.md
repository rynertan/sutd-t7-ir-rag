# Coupling.

## Abstract
The invention provides for a trailer coupling which includes one or more torque elements 20,22, 24, 26, 62 having pads 38 of elastic material interposed between an inner angular member 36 and an outer angular member 34 . The pads of elastic material permit but resist relative movement between the inner and the outer members. The inner and outer members are connected by linkages 30,32 to attachment plates 12,14,66 . The coupling can be attached to an between a draughting vehicle and a trailer to transmit traction force to the trailer. The resilient deformation of the pads of elastic material dampen relative movement between the draughting vehicle and the trailer.
