# Selective plating.

## Abstract
A method of selective plating a component 1 , which method comprises contacting upper and lower faces of the component 1 with upper and lower masks, respectively, so that the lower mask exposes a part of the component to be plated, positioning the component 1 over a plating tank and selective plating the component with a plating medium 18 , the plating pressure and the hardness of the material comprising the upper mask 16 being such that the upper mask 16 is deformed during plating so as at least partially to mask the edge s of the said exposed part.
