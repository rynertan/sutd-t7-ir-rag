# Process for the destruction of toxic organic products.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for the destruction of toxic organic halogenated substances which comprises treating in a reaction chamber under a reductive atmosphere and at a temperature of from 1000 to 1600 C a mixture of a toxic or ganic halogenated substance, carbon and a carbonate or bi carbonate of an alkali metal or of an alkaline earth metal whereby vapors of the alkali or alkaline earth metal are gener ated in situ to cause total degradation of the toxic organic halogenated substance into alkali or alkaline earth metal halide and carbon with the production of carbon monoxide which is subsequently oxidized into carbon dioxide.
