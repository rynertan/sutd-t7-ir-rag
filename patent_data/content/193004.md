# Corrosion resistant modified cu zn alloy for heat exchanger tubes.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a heat exchanger assembly 10 having particular utility as a motor vehicle radiator and having a plurality of heat exchange fluid passageways 18 formed from a modified copper zinc alloy. The copper zinc alloy contains from about 21 to about 39 zinc, from about 1 to about 5 nickel, from about .02 to about 1 arsenic and the balance essentially copper. In a preferred embodiment, the copper zinc alloy consists essen tially of from about 25 to about 35 zinc, from about 2.5 to about 3.5 nickel, from about 0.03 to about 0.06 arsenic and the balance essentially copper.
