# A process for removing polymer scale adhering to a polymerization vessel.

## Abstract
Polymer scale adhering to the inner surface of a polymerization vessel following polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer in an aqueous medium and discharge of the resulting polymer of vinyl chloride together with the aqueous medium from the polymerization vessel, is re moved by placing in the vessel a reaction product resulting from an amine compound and acrylic acid or a derivative thereof and an organic liquid which is a solvent for the reaction product and can dissolve or swell the polymer of vinyl chloride, and washing the inner surface of the vessel with the organic liquid solution of the reaction product.
