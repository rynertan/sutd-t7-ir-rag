# Variable diffuser device in a centrifugal compressor.

## Abstract
A diffuser device 4 disposed in a passageway between an air outlet of an impeller 16 and a swirl chamber bounded by a volute casing 1,2 in a centrifugal compressor, compris es a diffuser ring 4 adapted to be fixed to a casing wall defining the passageway, and a plurality of separate blades 9 for mounting on said ring at circumferentially spaced positions. Each diffuser blade have a boss 9a formed at one common end dimensioned to fit in a respective hole 41 drilled in the diffuser ring, the holes 41 being equal in number to the blades and being arranged circumferentially around the ring at the spacings required for said blades, and said holes having their axes parallel to each other and to the axis of the ring. The bosses of said blades are freely rotatable about the axes of their respective holes, whereby the blade angle Î± can be varied. The blades can then each be set at a desired blade angle by adjustment means 10, 12, 13 etc . The invention provides a method for manufacturing such a diffuser device as well as a coupled drive mechanism 52, 52 53 for the diffuser blades for rotating said blades in unison to a desired blade angle.
