# Fluorenecarboxylic acid derivatives, their preparation and use as plant growth regulators.

## Abstract
A series of ester and salt derivatives of fluorene 9 carboxy lic acid and fluorene 1 carboxylic acid exhibit significant plant growth regulating properties, useful in controlling the size, shape, dormancy time, flowering time and or fruit setting of plants, depending upon the concentrations used. They may also be used to control the growth rate, texture and color of turf grass. Presently preferred compounds include the cis 2,5 dimethylpyr rolidine salt of 1 fluorenecarboxylic acid, 9 cis 2,5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidinyl 2 chlorofluorene 9 carboxylic acid, methyl ester, the 2,6 dimethylpiperidine salt of 1 fluorenecarboxylic acid, and the cis 2,5 dimethylpyrrolidine salt of 9 hydroxyfluorene 9 carboxy lic acid.
