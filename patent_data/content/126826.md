# Radiation detector.

## Abstract
An optical scanning system e.g. for infra red has interspersed scans of wide and narrow fields of view. The scanning is performed by a rotating scanning mirror drum 32 , feeding a linear array detector 34 . The narrow field of view is defined by a cassegrainian telescope 16, 18 , and the wide field by a telescope 24, 26, 72, 73, 64, 74 . The necessary switching between the two fields of view is performed by the drum 32 , which has some of its mirror surfaces at one angle to reflect from one telescope to the detector, and others at another angle to reflect from the other telescope to the detector. The two telescopes have a common axis along the axis of rotation of the drum, and two mirrors 24, 26 fold the axis of one telescope to a position parallel to the drum axis. The mirrors are in a 3 1 3 1 3 1 arrangement, giving 3 scans of one telescope for each scan of the other.
