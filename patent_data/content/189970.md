# Superconductor magnet.

## Abstract
A superconducting magnet comprises a superconduct ing coil 4 which generates a magnetic field when current is caused to flow therethrough, and a vacuum heat insulation vessel 6 which serves to receive the coil and to hold it at a cyrogenic temperature, and said vacuum heat insulation vessel has a part thereof e.g. the outer cylinder 7 made of a ferromagnetic material which has a size and a thickness sufficient to exhibit a magnetic shield effect.
