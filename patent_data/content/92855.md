# Strip for flush mounting a washing unit in a counter top or the like.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for flush mounting a washing unit in a working leaf or the like and a strip to be used with this method. An opening corresponding to the washing unit 2 is made in the working leaf 1 , while the strip 6, 22, 29 is fastened to the working leaf edge which defines this opening so that the upper edge 9 of the strip substantially joins the upper surface 14 of the working leaf 1 . The strip in cross section is substantially U shaped, wherein the peripheral edge 17 of the washing unit 2 has a thickness greater than the distance between the ends of the legs 11, 12 of the strip. The lower leg 12 of the strip is a relatively rigid carrying flange, while the upper leg 11 is a relatively soft resilient sealing ribbon. The washing unit 2 is positioned with the one surface of its peripheral edge 17 on the one leg of the strip 6, 22, 29 and thereafter the other leg of the strip is applied to the exposed surface of the peripheral edge of the washing unit.
