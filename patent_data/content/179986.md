# Master retaining device for a printing machine.

## Abstract
A printing machine includes a printing drum 1 . A stencil master sheet retaining device for this printing ma chine includes a magnet plate 6 extending generally along a generator of the printing drum a clamp plate 8 , made of magnetically attractable material, which can be selectively positioned either to a position in which it lies against the magnet plate, or to a position in which it is removed away from the magnet plate a removal strip 13 which extends above the magnet plate generally between the magnet plate 6 and the clamp plate 8 and a means for raising the removal strip 13 away from the magnet plate, when the clamp plate is removed away from the magnet strip. This removal strip may be thin and elastic, and may be thus raised by being put into compression, option ally by its one end 13d being fixed to the printing drum and its other end 13a being moved towards that fixed end. In the case that the clamp plate 8 is thus selectively posi tioned either against the magnet plate 6 or away from the magnet plate by being pivoted around an axis generally parallel to the generator of the printing drum 1 , then the removal strip 13 , from its the fixed end 13d , may be passed over the magnet plate 6 and around the axis with its other end 13a fixed to the clamp plate 8 , the part of which generally at the axis of rotation thereof around which the removal strip is passed may be thickened.
