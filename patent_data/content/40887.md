## Description
Method and apparatus for treatment and hygienisation of sewage sludge and other organic sludges. The invention relates to a method for treatment and hygienisation of sewage sludge and other organic sludges. The problem of treatment and hygienisation of sludge, as residual product of wastewater treatment, is very old. The easiest and cheapest way to dispose of this sludge is sea dumping or storage on drying beds, by which the sludge is exposed to a prolonged natural thickening process before it can be removed. Sea dumping results in pollution s the sea, especially when this takes place near the coast and coastal seacurrents exist, while sea dumping at greater distance will dramatically increase transportation costs. Land area for drying beds is scarce in places with a high population, while just these places produce the greatest sludge volumes. The sludge may contain hazardous pathogenic bacteria. Many mechanical and chemical methods exist to change the properties of the sludge and to make it useful for other purposes like fertilizer. The extended aeration technology serves to obtain selfdestruction of the biomass resulting in reduction of bacteria population and sludge volume. Digestion of sludge is also practised at a temperature of approx. 35 degr. C. under anaerobic conditions. This process takes two to three weeks and organic components are partly converted into C02, H20 and CH4. It is further practised, to increase dewaterability and to effect the bacterial level, to add chemicals like lime, metalsalts and or polymeres. Heattreatment methods are known as well like a pasteuriation at a temperature between 70 and 75 degr.G. under slight overpressure.b treatment under higher pressure, between 25 and 30 bars at a temperature of 200 degr.C. and treatment with partial or complete oxydation by which operating pressures between 25 and 125 bars are used at temperatures between 190 and 280 degr.C at the same time air is introduced to obtain oxydation.Examples of last mentioned methods can be found in the Dutch patent 144.560 and published Dutch patent application 149.768. All known methods have quite a number of disadvantages such as high energy requirement, high invenstment costs, high operating costs, highly polluted supernatant liquor, odour nuisance, increase of sludge volume as a result of adding chemicals, fouling of the installation especially at higher temperatures etc. Aim of the invention is to provide a method with which all these problems can be solved in an extreme simple way. This requirement is obtained in accordance with the invention to bring the sludge under overpressure with gas, such as air, in a continuous flow or badge wise without supply of heat, so that the gas is absorbed in the sludge and then the sludge passes a unit after which the pressure suddenly is released. The method according to the invention in fact operates at ambient temperature. It is known that gases can be dissolved in a liquid and consequently also in sludge. The quantity of gas that can be dissolved is direct proportional with the pressure applied. Preferable is compressed air, but other gases can be used as well. In this respect it is mentioned that when oxygen is used a prekilling effect is obtained as this gas is toxic towards the biological sludge mass. In case light with short wavelength in combination is used the effect can be dramatically increased. Preferably the process is executed with an overpressure between 7 and 70 bars. The gasabsorbtion means that the gas penetrates into the cells of the organic material and bacteria. When the mixture has balanced out concerning pressure and corresponding gas absorbtion capacity, the presE im suddenly released, resulting in burs ng of the cells because the gas that is absorbed during a certain period of time has no time to escape in an equal time period. This cell bursting means that they are destroyed this also means destroying of the bacteria and besides this it also results in liberation of the cellwater, the capillar water and separation of the colloidal suspended solids.The method according to the invention is not only resulting in destruction of cell structures and consequently of bacteria, but at the same time in a flotating separation as a result of which the liberated solids do not sink but float. A proper separation of water and remaining solids can be achieved afterwards in a simple way by using a flotation unit. The method can be executed in such a way that primarily a pressurized vessel is filled with sludge, a badge, and after gas absorbtion a discharge valve is suddenly opened and a badge or part of it can escape. It is also possible to operate on a continuous basis by means of a controlled discharge unit, provided that the pressure and liquid level is kept constant. The method according to the invention is surprisingly simple what is required is just an installation to pressurize the sludge and air and an installation to add the compressed air to the sludge. The invention thus relates to an apparatus to execute the method and consists of a column with sludge feed at the top most part and sludge discharge at the bottom part, which column is provided with trays arranged cascade wise or equal means to devide the sludge into thin layers, which column is connected to a source of pressurized gas that can be disconnected and is situated between sludge feed and discharge. When cell material is disrupted no chemical or physical alterations of cell components will take place. Superheating cannot take plaxe, in contrary, the adiabatical expansion will result in cooling of the liquid. The efficiency of cell disruption depends on the pressure applied. At higher pressure larger amounts of air will be dissolved in the cells and a high degree of ceel disruption can be expected. Decompression of the sludge can be executed in a simple way by means of a special homogenizing discharge unit at the bottom part of the column. When this unit is opened or when a controlled discharge will take place, the gas saturated mixture is evacuated to atmospheric conditions. When this takes place the available pressure energy in the liquid will be converted into kenetic energy and create an exteme violence in the sludge mass, respectively results into high liquid velocities, turbulence and shearforces, so that an homogenization effect will result. When operating at high pressure, in this respect velocities as high as that of sound can be achieved. The large volume of air that is absorbed under force will be separated from the sludge after passing the discharge unit in a semi explosive way. The erti s ifl slu√†ge s wructu rsobtained, iyc ally tes l u 1 uniformity in size of the sludge particles which is of extreme importance for improved flo ation as a means to create maximum water separation the types and other water binding properties of the different typ es of sludge like free water, adsorbed and capillar water, intra cellular and colloidal water are strongly effect by this homogenization procedure.With the proposed technology the compactness and the inhomogenity of the sludge is destroyed and an improved separation of solids and liquid is obtained with the elevated pressure technology it now is made possible to flotate all types of sludge or mixtures of it in a satisfactorily way and will increase dry solids concentration considerably. As a result of this, final sludge volume will be reduced to at least 50 of the original underflow from e.g. a gravity thickener which outcome is obtained after extensive testwork. The method is insensable towards dry solids concentrations all organic mixtures can be treated on condition that they are free flowing liquids. Tests have been executed with pressures between 40 and 50 bars and a calculated energy consumption of approx. 2.5 kWh per m3 of liquid. It is possible to operate with low pressure, but with high pressure as well. Selection of operating pressure is predetermined by the sludge characteristic and retention time of the sludge in the system which offers an optimum in processing. If low pressure is preferred, improved results can be obtained e.g. by adding chemicals. such as to tothe mixture, resulting in lower osmotic pressure of the mixture in comparison with the cell liquid itself. The cells will show a preswelling effect. This phenomenon however is known in the respective art. The efficiency of cell rupture depends of the physical properties of the different bacteria species, the age of the biomass, the pressure applied and the degree of gas saturation of the cell suspension. The air applied for cell fractionating is liberated after pressure release and now functions as flotating medium for the treated sludge particles. Innumerable tiny air bubbles are spontanuously formed throughout the liquid and force the treated particles to the surface resulting in an intense floting effect.Tests have indicated that 50 of the original sludge volume can be separated as clean white water from ig tiG sludge igiXh e. . 4 5 dry solids. Bar separation purposes flotation thickeners can be used and centrifuges or beltfilter presses in case further dewatering is required. The apparatus for execution of the process according to the invention can be fully automized. Preferably the discharge unit is automatically controlled by a level controller that is connected to the column and adjusted to a predetermined level setting. Purpose of the sludge retention time is to expose the mixture sufficiently long to the pressurized gas sludge mixture, in order.to enable the dissolved gas in the liquid to penetrate through the cell membranes walls into the cell liquid. The connection of the pressurized gas source is located between sludge entrance and discharge, but preferably in the gas zone itself. Forementioned methods from the Dutch patent 144.560 and the published Dutch patent application 149.768 which describe the thermal oxidation sludge treatment also operate with high pressure. These pressures however in the first place serve to secure that the liquid phase of the sludge will not be converted into a gas phase at the respective temperature. The introduction of pressurized air serves to partly oxydize the sludge mixture.This oxydation serves to destroy cells and is obtained by heating in presence of oxygen. Disruption of cells by rapid decompression does not take place. The cells are already destroyed as a result of temperature elevation and oxydation before pressure is released.After being discharged consequently no flotation but settlement of the solids will take place. With the method according to the invention also gases that do not contain oxygen can be used like nitrogen this is not possible with the wet oxydation process. The invention now will be further explained and reference is made to the pertaining sketch on which the principle of the invention schematically is shown. This drawing indicates a column 1, provided with a number of trays 2, that ensure a cascade wise down flow of the sludge that enters the column at 3 thus creating a maximum of free surface area and holding time of the liquid to obtain optimal exposure towarasr the pressurizea gas that enters tne OOibn 4 . sludge feed takes place with pump 5 and pipe 6 to the entrance 3 of column 1. In pipe 6 a flow indicator 7 in installed with which the sludge flow is measured and indicated. An alarm si gnal will indicate when pump 5 is mal functioning. At 8 a multi stage air compressor is installed supplying compressed air to the column through airvessl 9, pipe 10 and connection 4. Pipe 1Q is provided with a valve 11 that is automatically controlled by pressure indicator 12, controlling the pressure level at a pre determined setting. The column 1 is provided with a discharge pipe 13 and valve 14 which valve has a discharge pipe 15, preferably connected to a flotation tank which is not indicated. This valve 14 can be controlled automatically by level controller 16 measuring the liquid level in column 1 continuously.The level controller 16 controls valve 14 in such a way that the sludge mixture 17 is evacuated by using the gaspressure in column 1 the sludge is kept at a constant level. Pump 5 will feed the sludge from a sludge holding tank or sludge thickener in which some thickening has taken place already to column 1 the flow can easily be adjusted by a variable drive. Sludge pump 5 must be able to feed the sludge into the pressurized saturation column1 and therefore must have a max. discharge pressure of e.g. 50 bars. A piston or piston membrane pump can be used for this purpose. The sludge enters at 3 and hits the splashplate 18 to increase liquid gas contact area more gas absorbtion takes place by passing cascade trays 2 during downward flow. During this downward flow sufficient time is available to saturate the sludge with gas. In the undermost part of column 1 the cell suspension is enabled to absorb gas through cell walls and when this has taken place after e.g.5 minutes discharge can take place. This discharge preferably is located slightly over the bottom 19 to collect coarse particles.This part should be provided with a cleaning out cover to remove these particles. Discharge valve 14 can be automatically controlledby a level controller 16 measuring the static height of the liquid column this column height has a relationship to the sludge retention time required for proper absorption of gas into the cell suspension. Pressurized air can be admitted at any place between sludge red to prevent that sludge will enter the gas piping system when the gas system is off pressure or during idle time of the plant. The air compressor 8 can be a normal multi stage unit suitable for e.g. 60 bars max. discharge pressure. A volume of 1 Nm3 atmospheric air per m3 of sludge is a reasonable sizing paramater. The efficiency of the compressed gas that is supplied to column 1 is 100 since gas is only discharged by the saturated sludge mixture itself. Method and apparatus according to the invention can be easily stopped and started them operations can be executed in a very short time. The plant can stand idle under full operating pressure without any loss of energy. Absence of heat will give no physical alterations, nor fouling or scaling of the system will take place. claims
