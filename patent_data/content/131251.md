An organosilane is held on the surface of the siliceous material, an enzyme is covalently bound to a cross linking agent which is covalently bound to the organosilane. The enzyme may be a mixture of proteases and amylase.US Patent No. 4,384,045 Ho et al. discloses a process for the preparation of a carrier for immobilization of enzymes by reacting a siliceous inorganic carrier material with a strongly basic solution and thereafter with a strongly acidic solution thereby obtaining a very high number of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface. Silica gel is mentioned as a suitable carrier material. It is possible to immobilize enzymes on the surface of the carrier material by covalent bonding to hydroxyl groups pendant from the surface of the carrier, and it is possible to obtain multiple layers of immobilized enzyme. The enzymes are bound to a silylated surface via a difunctional coupling agent, and lactase is the only enzyme mentioned in the claims.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe enzyme composition according to the invention comprises the enzyme immobilized by attachment to a particulate inorganic carrier material substantially free from calcium carbonate, calcium oxide and other acid soluble components, and comprising less than 1.2 by weight of trivalent metal ions, each particle of the inorganic carrier comprising at least 90 by weight of SiO2 and i having a porosity of 25 50 by volume based on mercury porosimetry, corresponding to a void volume of about 0.15 0.45 cm3 g as determined by mercury porosimetry ii having an average pore radius of 0.02 0.1 pm iii having an abrasion resistance of at least 95 , preferably about 99 , as determined according to ASTM No. E 728 80.A preferred carrier material comprises at least 95 by weight of SiO2. A preferred carrier material to be used in the enzyme compositions is a material with a surface area of at least 15 m2 g, preferably at least 25 m2 g, and more preferably at least 35 m2 g, based on mercury porosimetry.In the carrier material, pores with radia of 0.005 1 lim account for at least 80 , preferably at least 90 of the porosity.The carrier material may be used in any particle size suitable for the process in which the immobilized enzyme is involved. Depending on the use, suitable particle sizes are less than 50 lim, 0.1 0.5 mm, 0.5 1 mm, 1 2 mm, 1.5 2 mm, 1.5 2.5 mm, 2 4 mm and 1 6 mm.The carrier material comprising at least 90 of SiO2 has a hardness of about 7 on the Mohs scale.The carrier material can be prepared from a naturally occurring inorganic material comprising 20 50 of CaCO3 and 80 50 of SiO2, being partly crystalline and having an X ray diffraction pattern with the following positions of the principal reflection peaks in planar spacings, d 4.328, 4.267, 4.092, 4.053, 3.860, 3.349, 3.040, 2.497, 2.283, 2.093, 1.912, 1.873, and furthermore i having a porosity of at least 10 , preferably at least 20 , by volume based on mercury porosimetry, corresponding to a void volume of about at least 0.05 cm3 g, preferably at least 0.10 cm3 g, as determined by mercury porosimetry ii having a broad pore radius distribution with pore radia from less than 0.0025 ijm to about 5 lim, as determined by mercury porosimetry iii having a surface area of at least 10 m2 g, preferably at least 16 m2 g, based on mercury porosimetry, by porosity increasing treatment.In a special aspect of the invention, the carrier material is identical to a material prepared from an inorganic raw material having the following X ray diffraction pattern expressed by relative intensities as a function of the interplanar spacings 1 1may, d A 23, 4.328 25, 4.267 35, 4.092 36, 4.053 15, 3.860 4, 3.792 54, 3.349 100, 3.040 4, 2.846 1, 2.533 23, 2.497 5, 2.478 5, 2.460 23, 2.283 2, 2.236 4, 2.130 20, 2.093 2, 1.979 7, 1.924 20, 1.912 22, 1.873 7, 1.818, by porosity increasing treatment.The raw material from which the carrier material can be prepared is a naturally occurring material consisting of silicified limestone nodules.Said material has been formed by a silification process in calcareous sediments. The silica has been precipitated as a metastable mineral in the silification process resulting in a material which may be characterized as calcareous opal CT flint. It is contemplated that the silica component comprises quartz, opal, cristoballite, and tridymite.The chemical composition of the naturally occuring starting material based on atomic absorption analysis and calculated as oxides by weight is SiO2 50 80 CaO 11 28 Na2O 0.1 0.2 K2O 0.1 0.2 MgO 0.1 0.2 Fe2O3 0.1 0.8 A1203 0.4 1.2The CaO content corresponds to a calcium carbonate content of about 20 50 , preferably about 30 35 by weight of CaCO3. It is preferred to use a naturally occurring starting material containing calculated as oxides by weight about 60 65 SiO2, preferably about 63 SiO2, and 15 20 CaO, preferably about 19 CaO, the latter corresponding to a content of CaCO3 of about 34 by weight. The naturally occuring starting material has the following X ray diffraction pattern expressed by relative intensities as a function of the interplanar spacings 1 1may d A 23, 4.328 25, 4.267 35, 4.092 36, 4.053 15, 3.860 4, 3.792 54, 3.349 100, 3.040 4, 2.846 1, 2.533 23, 2.497 5, 2.478 5, 2.460 23, 2.283 2, 2.236 4, 2.130 20, 2.093 2, 1.979 7, 1.924 20, 1.912 22, 1.873 7, 1.818, and Fig. 2 shows a typical X ray diffractogram.The porosity of the naturally occuring starting material is about 20 by volume when measured by water absorption physical test methods are described below corresponding to a void volume of about 0.10 cm3 g. The naturally occuring starting material per se is not suitable for use as a carrier material for enzyme immobilization due to the CaCO3 content and insufficient physical properties porosity and surface area .The naturally occuring starting material has pore radia from less than 0.0025 lim to about 5 vm with a pore radius distribution maximum of about 0.01 lim and an average pore radius of about 0.02 lim. The surface area can be calculated to be at least 10 m2 g based on mercury porosimetry, preferably at least 16 m2 g.Using the BET method the surface area can be calculated to be at least 5 m2 g, preferably at least 9 m2 g.The apparent density of the starting material is about 2.5 g cm3.Based on measurements of isothermal water adsorption at different relative vapour pressures p pO less than I it can be concluded that pores with radia of less than 0.04 lim account for about 64 by volume of the total pore volume.The starting material used for the preparation of the porous carrier material differs essentially from other materials to be used as enzyme carriers, and the process for the preparation of the carrier material is a special process. The carrier material may be prepared from a naturally occurring material found as relatively big stones having a diameter of up to about 40 cm. This material is subjected to a porosity increasing treatment, i.e. an acid treatment after an optional size reduction treatment of the particles with subsequent screening and selection of a suitable fraction, e.g. of 0.01 10 mm. The size reduction may be carried out by jaw crushing, ball milling, etc. After the size reduction disintegration , the material is subjected to a screening process, e.g. on a system of sieves, followed by selection of the desired fraction s .It is preferred to carry out the porosity increasing acid treatment on a material with a particle size of at the most 10 mm, especially at the most 6 mm, preferably at the most 2 mm.Thereafter, the crushed particles are subjected to an acid under conditions sufficient to dissolve substantially all Cacao3 contained in the starting material. Suitable acids are strong mineral acids and organic acids, preferably nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and acetic acid.As CaCO3 in the crushed material is readily dissolved, it is most convenient to use only a slight excess of acid. Together with the content of CaCO3, other acid extractable components are removed, leading to a carrier material with a reduced content of e.g. trivalent metal ions.The carrier material prepared by acid treatment consists of at least 90 , preferably at least 95, and more preferably about 99 by weight of SiO2.The amount of acid employed is preferably 1 1.5 times the stoichiometric amount, especially about 1.2 times the stoichiometric amount, calculated on the basis of the CaCO3 content.The acid treatment is to be performed at a temperature which provides a reasonable duration of the treatment, elevated temperatures being preferred. Temperatures of about 20 900C are preferred, especially about 800C. Complete reaction is indicated by the absence of CaCO3, and analysis for CaCO3 may be performed by e.g. X ray diffraction analysis or atomic absorption analysis.Subsequent to the acid treatment, the material obtained is separated from the liquid phase containing the salts of the acid involved, and thereafter rinsed to yield a carrier material which is substantially free from acid residues and cations. After the rinsing process, which is normally carried out with water, the material is dried.The acid treatment results in a loss of weight of about 20 509o, normally about 25 40 w, especially about 30 35 .Owing to the dissolution of CaCO3 during the acid treatment, the pore volume increases to form a material having a porosity of 25 50 by volume, preferably 30 45 by volume, more preferably 40 45 by volume and especially about 42 by volume based on mercury porosimetry, corresponding to a void volume of about 0.15 0.45 cm3 g, preferably 0.18 0.36 cm3 g, more preferably 0.29 0.36 cm3 g and especially about 0.32 cm3 g when measured by mercury porosimetry in combination with excellent mechanical strength. Owing to the mechanical strength the carrier material may be used in tall columns.The acid treatment yields a material having pore radia from 0.001 lim to 10 iim with pore radius distribution maxima at about 0.01 lim and at about 0.2 pm. The average pore radius is 0.02 0.1 lim, especially 0.03 0.05 llm preferably 0.05 lim. Pores with radia of 0.005 1.0 lim account for at least 80 , preferably at least 90 Ó of the porosity.The acid treatment yields a material with a surface area of at least 20 m2 g, preferably at least 30 m2 g, more preferably about 40 45 m2 g, based on mercury porosimetry.The surface area according to the BET method is at least 10 m2 g, preferably at least 19 m2 g.The carrier material has an apparent density of 2.3 g cm3 and a bulk density of 0.6 0.7 g cm3. The carrier material to be used in the enzyme composition according to the invention differs from e.g. the material described in US PatentNo. 3,519,538 in being a mixture of crystalline SiO2 and amorphous opal.The porosity increasing treatment yields, unpredictably, a carrier material with a pore size which is advantageous for the immobilization of enzymes. The average pore radius of 0.02 0.1 lim, especially 0.03 0.05 ijm, preferably 0.05 iim, and the fact that pores with radia of 0.005 1 ttm in the carrier material account for at least 80 and preferably at least about 90 of the porosity, offers advantageous possibilities for diffusion of products and substrates.After the porosity increasing treatment the carrier material was shown to contain silanol groups on the surface offering the possibility of binding an advantageous amount of enzymes on the surface of the pores.Immobilizing enzymes is a well known technique offering several advantages as 1 it is possible to achieve repeated use of the enzymes involved and enzyme stability is often enhanced, 2 separation of product and enzyme is facilitated and there is reduced contamination with enzyme in the end product and 3 it implies better possibilities for reactor design as e.g. fluid bed and column reactors are fea sible . The enzyme may e.g. be attached to the carrier by adsorption, optionally followed by intermolecular cross linking, or by covalent bonding, optionally via a coupling agent. The term adsorption indicates the binding of a substance to the surface of another substance. By this is meant that the enzyme is non covalently bound directly to the surface of the carrier material, partly by means of hydrogen bonds and partly by ionic bonds between the enzyme and the silanol groups of the carrier material.Methods and reagents for the binding of enzymes to carrier materials are in principle known, but the combination with the carrier material according to the invention is novel. Furthermore, adsorption of functionally active enzymes directly to the surface of siliceous surfaces, optionally followed by a cross linking, has not been described in the patent specifications mentioned in the description of the prior art.The carrier material the immobilizer comprises silanol groups on the surface, said groups acting as functional groups, to which a coupling agent for the enzyme or the enzyme itself may be attached. The number of silanol groups is estimated to be about 2.2 per 100 2 of the carrier material described here.The number of silanol groups on the surface may be determined by neutralization with calcium hydroxide according to the reaction scheme Si OH Ca OH 2 SiO Ca OH H2O Enzymes which may be attached to the inorganic carrier material .nay be any enzyme selected from the group consisting of oxidoreduc ases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases, according to the classification system of the International Union of Biochemistry.The attachment to the carrier material may be performed by an adsorption and preferably followed by a cross linking of the enzyme molecules. The cross linking agent may be selected depending on the enzyme employed, and an example of cross linking agents is glutar dialdehyde. The attachment of the enzyme to the carrier material may also be obtained via covalent bonds between the enzyme and the inorganic carrier material, and in one embodiment thereof, the covalent bonding is performed via a coupling agent.As a coupling agent may be mentioned cyanogen bromide reacting as follows carrierEMI9.1 CNBr r carrierEMI9.2 The cyanogen bromide activated carrier may react with active hydroxyl or amino groups in the enzyme. Another way of attaching enzymes to the carrier material is to silylate the carrier material by means of a silylating agent such as 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane. Subsequent to the silylation, the carrier material may be treated with a coupling agent such as glutardialdehyde. The reaction may be illustrated as follows other reaction schemes are feasible, depending on the exact reaction conditions carrier OH Et0 3Si C EMI10.1 The silylated carrier material treated with coupling agent may then be reacted with an amino group in the enzyme.The reaction may be depicted as follows other reaction schemes are feasible, depending on the exact reaction conditions EMI10.2 Depending on the coupling agent employed, different reactive groups on the enzymes may be attached to the carrier material derivatized with reactive terminal groups.As examples of reactive groups on the enzymes may be mentioned e.g. amino groups, carboxy groups, aliphatic and aromatic hydroxy groups, and mercapto groups, and as examples of reactive terminal groups on the carrier material may be mentioned, but not limited to, amino groups, carboxy groups, acryl halide groups, alkyl halide groups, mercapto groups, etc.Illustrative examples of reactive groups on the enzymes X , reactive terminal groups on the carrier materials Y and coupling agents are as follows Enz X Carrier Y Coupling Agent X Y NH2 NH2 Glutardialdehyde, tri azines, iso thio cyanates COOH NH2 Carboc iimides NH2 COOH Carbodiimides or via acid chloride or via azidePreferred enzymes to be immobilized on the carrier material according to the invention are acylases, especially amidases and esterases, and decarboxylating enzymes.As preferred examples may be mentioned amidases, an example thereof being amino acylase E.C.3.5.1.14 catalyzing the reactionEMI11.1 Another important example of acylases is penicillin acylase which is used in the synthesis of penicillins.Further important enzymes are lyases and glucose isomerases.An especially interesting enzyme is acetolactate decarboxylase E.C.4.1.1.5 which catalyzes the following reaction EMI11.2 thereby removing acetoloctate which is a precurser for diacetyl which in large concentrations conveys an objectionable character to certain biochemical products Godtfredsen, S.E., and Ottesen, M., CarlsbergRes.

In the calculation of pore radia, it was assumed that there was a contact angle of 1400 between mercury and the carrier material.It appears that the pores in the carrier material are divided into two groups having pore radius distribution maxima of about 0.01 and of about 0.2ism, respectively.Fig. 2 shows the X ray diffractogram of the starting material for the carrier material.Fig. 3 shows the X ray diffractogram of the carrier material.Fig. 4 is a SEM photo of the naturally occuring starting material.Fig. 5 is a SEM photo of the carrier material.PHYSICAL METHODSMercury PorosimetryMercury porosimetry is a suitable test method for the determination of the pore size distribution. When the contact angle of a liquid to a solid is above 900 mercury about 1400 , only a minimum of pressure p is necessary in order to force the liquid into a cylindrical cavity having the radius r.

When V is plotted against r, the dV pore volume distribution Tr may be determined as a function of r by graphical differentation.The total internal surface area S of all pores with radii between ra and rb ra rb may be calculated by the equationEMI13.1 wherein for cylindrical pores 2 Vp S p rp wherein 5p the surface of the pore Vp the volume of the pore rp the radius of the poreThe determinations of mercury porosimetry on the carrier material were performed on a Mercury Penetration Porosimeter, Model 905 1,Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norgrass, Georgia, USA. A sample of 3 4 g was used for each test run. In calculating the pore radius r corresponding to the pressure p, 6 484 dyn cm and o 1400 were used. 1400 is the normal contact angle between mercury and solids . Fig. 1 shows the curve illustrating pore volume plotted against pore radius, measured by mercury porosimetry. Determination of the surface area according to the BET methodThe BET method according to a reference to Nelson, F.M. andEggertsen, F.T. 30, 1958, p. 1387 was used in the calculation of the specific surface area. Nitrogen at 1960C was used as adsorbant.Isothermal adsorption of waterIsothermal water adsorption on the starting material was carried out at different relative vapour pressures p pO less than 1 leading to the following connection between the amount of water adsorbed per 100 g of solid and the relative vapour pressure 9 100 g, pup, 0.0, 0.11 0.0, 0.23 0.5, 0.58 1.2, 0.75 1.6, 0.83 4.0, 0.92 6.9, 0.97.Density and water absorptionThe apparent density and water absorption were determined in principle according to Danish Standard No. 405.2, using an evacuation step in order to accelerate the absorption of water in the pores.The porosity determined by water absorption shows a larger value than the determination by mercury porosimetry caused by the fact that water may penetrate into pores too small for mercury penetration at the pressure used 50,000 psia .Determination of average pore radiusThe average pore radius was calculated by the equation 2xv r av 5BET wherein v the pore volume as determined by water absorption and 5BET surface area according to the BET method X ray diffractograms X ray diffractograms were made using CuKa1 radiation. The diffraction analysis was performed at a rate of 1 40 per minute or 10 per minute and with a time constant of 8 sec or 2 sec, respectively. The amount of impulse was plotted against the diffraction angle 2 0. The relative intensities were calculated as the ratio between the individual heights of maxima and the height of the maximum with the maximum intensity in the spectrum.The values of the interplanar spacings were calculated according to the formula Cuka1 d 2sinE XCuKa being 1.54051 A and e the angle between the direction of the entering rays and the planes.The analyzed material was identified by comparison between the calculated planar interspacings d and relative intensities with standard tables ASTM and data in the literature.Preparation of test sample for X ray diffractometryAbout 1 g of the material was disintegrated in an agate ball mill until a fine powder was obtained 15 minutes .Determination of silanol groupsSilanol groups on the surface of the carrier material may be determined according to the scheme ESi OH Ca OH 2 Si O Ca OH H2O From a saturated and filtrated solution of Ca OH 2 at about 300C, 12 different Ca OH 2 solutions were prepared, the concentrations varying from 0.6 to 1.0 g of CaO per liter. The exact concentrations were determined by atomic absorption. Samples of about 1.5 g of carrier material were placed in polyethylene flasks and covered with nitrogen.50 ml of Ca OH 2 solution were added. The flasks were shaken vigorously for 3 minutes, and the conductivity L was measured. Based upon the conductivity in the individual Ca OH 2 solutions and the known concentrations Co, the equilibrium concentration C1 could be calculated as L1 C1 x Co Lo When the amount of CaO gram absorbed per gram of carrier material was plotted against C1 mol liter , the maximum amount of CaO absorbed was found to be 0.004 g per gram of carrier material. This corresponds to 7.1 meqv. of OH per 1009 of carrier material.By means of the surface area 19m2 per g of carrier material according to the BET method and Avogadros number, the number of silanolgroups per 100 A2 of carrier material may be calculated as 2.2 silanol groups per 100 2. ASSAYSAminoacylase obtained from Sigma as a freeze dried product prepared from hog kidney , was assayed at 250C in 3.0 ml of 15 mM N acetylL methionine in 20 mM phosphate puffer pH 7.0 . The immobilized enzyme was shaken on a Griffin shaker during the assay. After 15 minutes, a sample of the liquid phase was taken out, and the free amino acid formed was determined by the ninkydrin method Moore,S. and Stein, W.H., J.Biol.Chem. 176, 1948, p. 367 . After terminated assay, the immobilized enzyme was filtered off, dried at 1150C overnight and weighed. One IU was defined as the amount of aminoacylase which in this assay forms 1 llMol L methionine per minute.Acetolactate decarboxylase in dissolved form was determined as described Godtfredsen, S.E. and Ottesen, M., Carlsberg Res. Commun.47, 1982, p. 93 . Immobilized acetolactate decarboxylase was similarly assayed on a shaking table and immobilized aminoacylase was used as a blind. After the assay was terminated, immobilized enzyme was filtered off and washed, dried overnight at 1150C and weighed. OneU acetolactate decarboxylase formed 1 FrMol acetoin per hour at 370C and pH 6.5 from acetolactate.Protein was determined according to Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem.193, 1951, p. 265 with Bovine Serum Albumin as standard.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of the carrier materialGround down, raw calcareous opal CT flint stones were treated with an excess of acid, whereby the content in the stones of CACAO, 34 of CaCO3 on an average was dissolved.Three fractions of ground down calcareous opal CT flint stones grain sizes 1 2, 1 2 2 and 3 5 mm have been treated with various acids with and without heating and for various periods of time.Samples of the ground down stones were dried in an incubator at 1000C for 48 hours. About 2 g of material were weighed out in beakers and an excess of minimum 25 ml g of stone 0.4M acid H NO3, HCI or CH3COOH was added. The beakers with stone and acid were left for treatment at room temperature for periods varying from 1 2 to 4 hours. Stirring with glass spatula was done frequently. The samples treated with hot acid were heated on electrical plates to a temperature of about 800C with frequent stirring. The individual samples were filtered on a glass filter, washed with distilled water until pH 6 and left to dry on the filter in an incubator at 1100C until constant weight. The loss in weight was calculated.X ray diffraction analysis was carried out on the acid treated samples wherein the loss in weight was x 34 to ascertain any content ofCaC03. The porosity was determined in the carrier material by means of mercury porosimetry. The results are shown in Fig. 1, curve 2 .The surface area was 19 m2 g according to the BET method.

This acidwashed carrier material was used in all subsequent silylations and enzyme immobilizations.EXAMPLE 3Silylation 3 Aminopropyl triethoxysilane Dynamit Nobel was distilled b.p. 109 110aC 12 mm Hg and used as described by Weetall, H.H., Methods Enzymol. 44, 1976, p. 134, for silylation in an aqueous medium and in toluene with varying amounts of silane. The reaction conditions appear from Table I vide p. 25 .EXAMPLE 4 immobilization of acetolactate decarboxylase E.C.4.1.1.5 on silylated carrier material via coupling with glutardla7dehyde To silylated I or V carrier material 4.0 g was added 2.5 glutardialdehyde 80 ml in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5 . The mixture was kept at room temperature with frequent shaking whereby the carrier material gradually assumed a tan to reddish brown colour. A few per cent of the particles clearly differed from the rest in that they were almost white and apparently did not react with glutardialdehyde. After reaction for 3 hours, the mixture was filtered and the product washed thoroughly with water. The moist material was added to an enzyme solution 10 ml containing acetolactate decarboxylase 2440 U , protein 106 mg in 60 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and the mixture was left with frequent shaking at room temperature for 5 hours. he reddish brown immobilisate was filtered off and washed on the filter with 0.2 M phosphate buffer 80 ml, pH 6.5 in order to remove adsorbed enzyme, and then washed with water 110 ml . The immobilized enzyme was stored moist in a closed container.EXAMPLE 5Immobilization of acetolactate decarboxylase E. C .4.1.1.5 on on silylated carrier material via coupling with 1 cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinoethyl carbodiimide, metho p toluenesulphonate CMC To silylated V carrier material 3.0 g was added an enzyme solution 13 ml containing acetolactate decarboxylase 880 U , protein 40 mg in 0.15 M phosphate buffer, pH 4.0 followed by CMC 500 mg . The reaction mixture was kept at 40C overnight, but quickly started to give an amorphous precipitate. The next day, the supernatant pFl 6.0 and the amorphous precipitate were decanted off.The carrier material was filtered and washed on the filter with 0.2 M phosphate 50 ml, pH 6.5 followed by water 300 ml , whereupon the product was stored moist in a closed container.EXAMPLE 6 Adsorption of acetolactate decorboxylase E.C.4.1.1.5 on non silylated carrier material followed by cross linking with glutardialdehydeTo an enzyme solution 8.6 ml containing acetolactate decarboxylase 2280 U and protein 58 mg dialyzed against water was added non silylated carrier material 3.0 g and the solution was kept at 40C overnight whereupon the adsorbed enzyme was filtered off and washed with water 75 ml . The moist material was divided into two portions of approximately equal size which were separately added to 20 ml of a 0.5 and a 2.5 aqueous solution of glutardialdehyde, respectively. After 2 hours at room temperature with frequent shakings, the two reaction mixtures were separately filtered and washed with 0.2 M phosphate buffer 100 ml, pH 6.5 and water 200 ml . The two immobilized enzyme compositions were stored moist in closed containers.EXAMPLE 7 immobilization of aminoacylase E.C.3.5.1,14 on silylated carrier material via coupling with glutardialdehydeTo 50 mM phosphate buffer 90 ml, pH 7.0 was added aqueous 25 glutardialdehyde 10 ml and silylated Vl carrier material 5.0 g .After 2 hours at room temperature with frequent shaking, the now reddish brown material was filtered off and thoroughly washed with water. The moist material was added to an enzyme solution containing aminoacylase 6000 IU , and protein 250 mg in 20 ml 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and stirred at room temperature for 5 hours. The immobilized enzyme was filtered off and washed first with 0.1 M phosphate buffer 60 ml, pH 7.0 and then with water 300 ml . The filtrate and the washings contained protein 185 mg and aminoacylase 3360 lU . The immobilized enzyme was stored moist in a closed container, and was found to contain 13 mg of protein per gram and an enzymatic activity of 2.9 IU per gram. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSilylationThe silylation experiments carried out are listed in Table I. The silylation reagent will react with silanol groups present on the carrier material, and it appears that under the conditions applied the carrier material can covalently attach up to 7 of its weight in silane. The amounts of bound silane as determined by difference weighing were in all cases about half the amounts of bound silane as determined as non recovered silane. This may be due to loss of residual water from the carrier material during the silylation. Silylation VII and VIII were control experiments showing that no procedural loss of silane occurred, and that silica 60 Merck compared to the carrier material could bind about 10 times as much silane per gram.Silylation I carried out in an aqueous medium seemed to bind a considerably smaller amount of silane than could be obtained by silylation in toluene. This is in agreement with previous observations on other inorganic carriers, Weetall H.H, Methods Enzymoi. 44, 1976, p. 134 . Immobilization of Acetolactate Decarboxylase and AminoacylaseAcetolactate decarboxylase can be found in a number of bacteria Chuang, L.F. and Collins, E.B., J. Bacteriol. 95, 1968, p. 2083 Juni, E., J. Biol. Chem. 195, 1952, p. 715 Godtfredsen, S.E. et al., Corlsberg Res. Commun. 48, 1983, p. 239 and purified as described in the literature Lken, J.P. and Starter, F.C., Eur. J.Biochem. 14, 1970, p. 133 . A partial purification Godtfredsen, S.E.and Ottesen, M., Carisberg Res. Commun. 47, 1982, p. 93 furnished the enzyme as an ammonium sulphate precipitate, which was dialyzed either against distilled water or against 25 mM phosphate pH 6.5 .The two dialyzed enzyme solutions containing 6.8 mg ml protein with 39 U per mg of protein and 13.2 mg ml protein with 23 U per mg of protein, respectively, were both used for the immobilization experiments as described in Examples 4, 5, and 6.The results of the immobilization experiments with acetolactate decarboxylase are listed in Table II. The coupling with glutardialdehyde was performed with both silylated V carrier material which showed the highest degree of silylation Table I and with silylated I carrier material, which had been silylated in an aqueous medium and only seemed to be silylated to a small extent. Both of the silylated carrier material compositions assumed a tan to reddish brown colour during the glutardialdehyde reaction, although silylated V carrier material clearly was the more strongly coloured. Both of the two silylated carrier material compositions gave enzymatically active products during the glutardialdehyde coupling, but activity as well as yield and protein binding were higher for the carrier material silylated in aqueous medium.The CMC coupling did not seem to be suitable for acetolactate decarboxylase. Although the activity losses during pH adjustment and washing were smaller than was observed for aminoacylase, the immobilisate was practically devoid of enzymatic activity.The adsorption on non silylated carrier material followed by glutardialdehyde cross linking gave compositions of immobilized acetolactate decarboxylase with good activity. 79 of the added protein amount and 89 of the added activity were adsorbed, and after cross linking, both activity and yield were the highest obtained. It did not seem to be of great importance whether the cross linking took place in 0.5 or in 2.5 glutardialdehyde.The immobilization of aminoacylase to silylated carrier material via coupling with glutardialdehyde gave an enzymatically active immobilisate, albeit in low yield 0.5 and with recovery of 56 of the starting activity in the washings.After the immobilizations, the carrier material was washed with a high buffer concentration to liberate adsorbed protein. The immobilized enzyme must therefore be considered to be covalent attached, and this is supported by the fact that for the immobilized aminoacylase, no leakage of enzyme to the solution under assay conditions was observed, and removal of immobilized enzyme by filtration effectively removed all enzymatic activity.For aminoacylase as well as for acetolactate decarboxylase, both coupling with glutardialdehyde and adsorption plus glutardialdehyde cross linking gave an attachment of 11 18 mg of protein per gram of carrier material.
