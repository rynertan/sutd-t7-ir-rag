# Friction materials and their manufacture.

## Abstract
Low density friction products composed of non asbestos reinforcing fibers embedded in a matrix of binder material, op tionally including friction and wear modifiers, are described in which the actual density of the product is less than 72 of the theoretical density. Clutch facings of this density exhibit im proved wear characteristics, lower inertia and increased burst strength.
