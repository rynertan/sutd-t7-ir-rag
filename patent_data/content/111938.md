# Fast convergence method and system for echo canceller.

## Abstract
An echo canceller for cancelling echo entailed by impedance mismatching in a two wire four wire conversion circuit. The tap correction amount at the start of operation is increased because the residual echo level of that instant is large, while it is decreased as the convergence proceeds in accordance with the then decreasing residual echo level. This shortens the convergence time required for an echo canceller.
