# Triple mode dielectric loaded bandpass filters.

## Abstract
A triple mode dielectric loaded bandpass filter 28 has at least one cavity 30 resonating in three independent ortho gonal modes. The triple mode cavity 30 can be mounted adjacent another cavity 32 which may be either a single, dual or triple mode cavity. Any reasonable number of cavities can be used as well as various arrangements of cavities. Inter cavity coupling is achieved through an iris 34 having two separate apertures 36, 38 that together form a T shape. The cavities are planar mounted. The filter 28 is designed for use in the satellite communication industry and results in substantial savings in weight and size when compared to previous filters.
