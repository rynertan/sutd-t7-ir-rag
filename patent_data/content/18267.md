# Magnetic recording method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Information signals are recorded onto a magnetic medi um by a magnetic recording head having a magnetic record gap length of less than about 0.38 Âµm during relative motion between the head and the medium. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the aforementioned magnetic head is used with a magnetic medium comprising magnetic particles having both cubic crystalline and acicular shape anisotropies.
