## Description
Improvements in or relating to friction liningsThis invention relates to friction linings made from glass yarns, for example clutch facings and friction linings incorporating woven fabrics.Clutch facings of wound construction may be manufactured by impregnating yarns with a solution of a thermosetting resin or vulcanisable elastomer, drying to remove excess solvent and then winding to produce an annular shaped facing preform. The resin or elastomer binding agent may be hardened or cured by the application of heat and pressure to the facing preform enclosed in a suitably shaped die. Facings may be further heated or baked at elevated temperatures after curing to improve strength or friction properties.We have made clutch facings from glass fibre yarns produced by conventional textile twisting and plying operations from either continuous glass fibre filaments or from staple glass fibre filaments. Yarns containing continuous glass fibre filaments have relatively tight compact structures with little space between individual filaments and between the twisted bundles of filaments comprisirg the ply structure of the yarn. Such yarns cannot absorb and retain large quantities of impregnant solutions and, unless the impregnant has a low viscosty, very little penetration of the impregnant into the bundles of filament occurs.Clutch facings manufactured from such continuous filament based yarns show many loose unimpreqnated fibres projecting fron the surfaces which have been ground or turned thus making dimensional tolerances difficult to maintain. A further problem is that the preform does not flow well under pressure and fails to fill or flow to the edges of the curing die during the curing operation unless the preform is wound so that it is such a tight fit that it is difficult to insert into the curing die. Continuous filament glass fibre yarns possess much greater strength than staple glass fibre yarns and enable the production of clutch facings of high burst strenqth the speed at which the fixing may be rotated before disintegrating under the action of centrifugal forces .Yarns containing staple glass fibres have bulky structures with relatively large spaces between individual fibres and many fibre ends protrude from the yarn surface. Such yarns can absorb relatively large quantities of impregnant solutions and excessively dilute solutions are not required for penetration into the centre of the yarn. Clutch facing preforms wound from impregnated staple glass fibre yarns produce well filled mouldings with good edges. Adhesion between adjacent yarns is excellent and the facings may be satisfactorily ground or machined. Clutch facings containing staple filament glass fibre yarns are generally of lower strengths than facings containing continuous glass fibre yarns.A further disadvantaqe of staple glass fibre yarns is that broken fibres fall out of the yarn during impregnation resulting in contamination of the impregnant bath whizz increases the viscosity of the impregnant and reduces its penetration into the yarn. The atmosphere surrounding the impregnation apparatus also becomes contaninated with these broken fibres, commonly known as fly . Staple glass fibres are normally tapered and, if broken, short fibres of respirable diameter may be produced thus causing a potential hazard to health. Clutch facings incorporating improved glass yarns with rough or open surfaces comprising continuous glass fibre filaments, staple glass fibre filaments or combinations of the two are described in our pending UK patent specification No.2039 557 A.One such yarn has projecting loops where one group of strands is wrapped around another group of strands and the whole yarn overwrapped with a fine thread, loops being produced by overfeeding the wrapping group of strands.Loop structure yarns are made wholly from continuous filaments and have high strength whilst retaining relatively large quantities of impregnant solutions.Strong clutch facings may be manufactured from such yarns but viscous impregnant solutions are retained in the relatively large loops and surface intterstices without penetrating between the closely packed filaments in each strand of the yarn. Two stage impregnation, as described in our pending UK Patent specification No.2,033,443, where the yarn is first impregnated in a dilute solution of thermosetting resin which can penetrate between individual glass filaments, dried to remove solvent and then reimpregnated wire a more viscous solution or dispersion of thermosetting binder cement, is desirable with these yarns, t3 prevent bundles of unimpregnated glass filaments remaining in the yarn and projecting from ground or machined surfaces of facings made from them. Also the wound preforms must be made a tight fit in the curing die to ensure complete filling of the die during press curing.Wrapped staple glass fibre yarns are more expensive than continuous filament loop structure yarns and less strong, and also require the two stage impregnation with binder cement to satisfactorily impregnate the continuous filament core.We have found that improved yarns for winding clutch facings may be manufactured from textured continuous filament glass fibres and that clutch facings containing such yarns possess improved properties.Thus, according to the present invention a friction lining includes a fibrous material comprising a textured continuous filament glass yarn, into which at least 1.58 of retained overfeed has been introduced during texturing and an impregnant for said fibrous material comprising a thermosetting polymeric material. The friction lining may, for example, be a wound clutch facing.Continuous filament glass yarns may be textured, for example, by the action of a turbulent air jet to produce yarns of increased bulk which possess the relatively high bulk of staple fibre yarns but with higher strength and at reduced cost. In the texturing process one or more strands, each comprising a multitude of parallel, fine continuous glass filaments coated with a size which holds the bundle of filaments together, are passed through a turbulent air jet in which the size coating is broken, allowing the individual filaments to separate from the strand and then become tangled together to produce a relatively open, butty structure in which individual filaments are no longer parallel to each other.The strands are fed into the texturing jet at a higher speed than that at which they are withdrawn from the jet, the excess material being converted by the turbulent air stream to loops and waves, which become entangled with each other to create the desired bulk.The amount of texture introduced into a yarn may be measured by comparing the weight of a given length of yarn before texturing with the same length of yarn after texturing, the percentage increase in weight of the given length of yarn being called the percentage retained overfeed . A lightly textured yarn, in which the glass filaments are separated from the original strand but remain relatively straight would have a retained overfeed of about 0.5 whereas a heavily textured yarn, in which the filaments lie in wavy paths and are highly entangled to produce a bulky yarn, would have a retained overfeed of over 10 . The retained overfeed can be varied by changing the overfeed applied, air pressure, wind up tension, in a known manner. We have impregnated a range of textured glass yarns having different amounts of retained overfeed with a typical binder cement and found that impregnant pickup increases as retained overfeed is increased and, at high levels of pickup, the yarn dries very slowly and cannot be impregnated at economical production rates. In addition, clutch facings made from yarns containing large quantities of impregnants have low burst strengths.We thus prefer that the yarns used in the present invention have a retained overfeed of no nore than 9 and preferably no more than 6 . If desired the strands may be twisted, individually or together, before being subjected to texturing.Binder impreqnant pick up may be reduced to a lower desired level for a particular yarn by consolidating the yarn by twisting prior to impregnating. The twist required is determined by the bulk and tex of the original textured yarn. As the cost of a twisting operation increases with the twist level and the twist levels required to reduce the pick up of higher bulk yarns to acceptable levels tend to render the yarn twist lively , necessitating doubling to obtain stability, a further expensive step, we prefer to operate at lower levels of bulk and twist. For example, yarns of about 1800 tex and 38 retained overfeed tend to have impregnant pick ups of 200 2508 by weight which is more than desired in order to produce high burst strength facings.The insertion of 20 80 tpm reduces this pick up to the more preferred levels of 180 808 respectively.A commonly used concept in the textile industry is that of Twist Factor . This is defined as the product of the twist level usually in turns per metre and the square root of the tex. Yarns of different tex having the same twist factor tend to have very similar properties in respect of bulk, liveliness, specific strength etc, and thus tend to behave similarly during impregnation. For air textured glass yarns with approximately 3 retained overfeed we prefer to operate at twist factors within the range 1000 3003. We have further found that the addition of metal wires to air textured yarns improves the friction and wear characteristics of clutch facings produced from such yarns, suitable wires being those which have been used in conventional asbestos based clutch yarns e.g. copper, brass, bronze and zinc but wires made of either metals may be used if desired. Metal wires of ve small diameters may be added to the glass fibre strands as they pass into the texturing jet but it is more convenient to add the usual thicknesses of wire e.g. about 36 swg as employed in asbestos yarns, during the twisting operation given to the yarn. One or more wires may be added, either as a core to the yarn with the glass distributed around the wire or as a wrapper lying in a helical path around the twisted glass yarn. Impregnant pickup and penetration may be reduced by wrapping the wire around the glass, pickup depending upon the amount of twist in the final yarn and on the tension in the wire if maximum pickup or penetration is required, wrapper wire tension and yarn twist should be kept to a minimum. Two or more fine wires may be used as wrappers instead of one thicker wire and nay be placed side by side or spaced apart, spaced wrappers reduce impregnant pickup compared to side by side wrappers but friction facings made from spaced wrapper yarn shown a more uniform distribution of wire in their surfaces.Wire may also be wrapped around a textured glass strand by using a conventional wrapping machine to produce a bound strand comprising an untwisted core of textured glass fibre filaments helically wrapped with one or more wires. The glass core is again consolidated by the action of wrapping it with wire and yarns with satisfactory impregnation characteristics may be manufactured by this process.The wrap frequency of the wire may be higher using this process than by twisting the glass and wire together whilst still saintaining satisfactory impregnation properties e.g. one end of 1800 tex textured glass yarn wrapped at 120 turns per metre gave an impregnant pickup of 1358 by weight whereas a satisfactory twisted yarn could not be made at 120 turns per metre through being too twist lively and too tightly consolidated to process properly. A twisted yarn made at 80 turns per metre gave a dope pick up of only 80 and the dope did not penetrate well into the yarn.Bound strand yarns with opposed helical wire wrappers have been made but dope pick up is lower than when only one wire is used, e.g one end of 1800 tex textured glass yarn bound with two ends of 38 swg brass wire at 120 turns per metre gave a pickup of 89 ..Organic fibres may be incorporated into yarns in addition to glass fibres to modify friction, wear and density characteristics of friction facings by a passing continuous filament organic fibres and glass fibre strands through the texturing jet to produce a textured yarn in which the fibres are intimately mixed or b plying or doubling one or more ends of organic fibre yarns with one or more ends of textured glass fibre yarn, the fibres in the resulting yarn not being as well mixed together as in a but staple organic fibres may be added by this method.Organic fibres which decompose without melting are preferred but heat fusible fibres may be used although fusible fibres may soften or melt during clutch engagements where high temperatures are reached.The addition of polyester fibres in a wound glass clutch facing containing a textured glass yarn and one end of brass wire was found to reduce friction levels at low temperatures when compared with those obtained from similar yarns containing only the textured glass yarn and brass wire. The friction levels of sud facings containing polyester fibres were bound to increase when tested at temperatures in the region 150 C to 250 C, the addition of fusible organic fibres being a useful method of improving the fade resistance of clutch facings containing glass fibres. Certain syntheti fibres, e.g.polyacrylonitrile, can behave either as fusible or infusible fibres depending on the type of polymer and circumstances of use.Clutch facings containing infusible organic fibres i.e.fibres which under the influence of heat normally decompose without melting may be made by adding the infusible organic fibre to the glass fibre yarn or by combining one or more infusible organic fibre yarns with one or more textured glass fibre yarns as the yarns are passing into the impregnating bath. Suitable infusible organic fibres are natural or regenerated cellulose fibres e.g. cotton, jute, hemp, sisal, rayon, phenolic resin fibres and aronatic polyamide or arabia fibres.If the infusible fibre is to be textured with the glass fibre then it must be available as continuous filaments, thus excluding natural staple cellulose fibres which may only be added as yarns during a doubling or plying operation or during the impregnation stage.We have found the inclusion of infusible organic fibres in textured glass fibre yarn based friction facings to be advantageous, enabling the facing density to be reduced and hence the inertia of the clutch friction plate minimized without producing undesirable effects on strength or performance. If desired, friction levels and fade performance may be modified by the inclusion of suitable quantities of either fusible or infusible organic fibres in the friction facing. Textured glass fibre yarns containing glass fibres alone, glass fibres and metal wires or glass fibres and organic fibres with or without the addition of metal wires nay be used to weave fabrics which, after impregnating with binders, are suitable for use as friction elements in clutches or brake mechanisms. Typical impregnants include solutions of thermosetting resins, elastomers and asphalt or similar pitch like materials and also drying oils.The proportion of metal wire incorporated into the textured glass yarn may be from 0 to 40 of the total weight of the yarn although we prefer to use proportions of between 5 and 30 of the yarn weight. The incorporation of high proportions of dense metal wires such as copper or brass results in the production of excessively high density facings unless large amounts of organic fibre are also incorporated into the yarn. The proportion of organic fibres incorporated into the textured glass yarn may be from 0 to 100 of the weight of glass present in the yarn, the preferred proportion of heat fusible organic fibres being 1 158 of the weight of glass present in the yarn and the preferred proportion of infusible organic fibres being 10 67 of the weight of glass present in the yarn.The invention will now be described by way of example only, in the following Examples Example 1 relationship between yarn texturing and impregnant pick upAir jet textured glass fibre yarns were manufactured from continuous filament E glass fibre of 10 micron filament diameter and impregnated with a binder composition as shown in Table I.

The facings were cured at a temperature of 1500C and a pressure of 2 tons per square inch of facing area for a period of six minutes, breathing the press as necessary to prevent blistering of the facing.The press cured facings were then baked for six hours at a temperature of 2000C whilst clamped between two stiff metal plates to prevent distortion and then ground to the desired thickness.Finished facing density 2.09 2.16 g mlBurst Strength of 8 x5g drilled facings at 2000C 12000 14000 rpm.Example 3 1600 tex glass fibre strand and 250 tex viscose rayon were passed together through an air texturing jet to produce a textured yarn with a retained overfeed of 38 one end of which was twisted with one end of 36 swg brass wire as a wrapper to produce a yarn with a twist of 68 turns per metre.
