## Description
Description.of the invention entitled Procedure for monitoring non homogenization inside sterilization chambers, and device suitable for carrying out said procedure in the name of Pierantonio SALVADOR at S. Martino al TagliamentoSubmitted on under No. This invention concerns a procedure for monitoring non far monitoring.non homogenization inside sterilization chambers chambers. The invention also concerns a device suitable for carrying out said procedure for monitoring non homogenization inside sterilization chambers. Steriliiation or the process of sterilization is carried on with a plurality of operations following each other and able to accomplish the sterility of a material, whereby the sequence of said operations is called the sterilization cycle. Said sterilization cycle synthesizes the connection between the microbiological aspects of sterilization and the technical and operating aspects of the execution of the sterilization process. It is essential, if the cycle is to have a good outcome, that the cycle itself should be carried out in conditions of homogeneity of the sterilizing agent in respect of the mat terial to be sterilized. Industrial sterilization is most often carried out with the employment of satured steam as the sterilizing agent.It is known that with conditions of saturation it is equiv .alent to indicate either the temperature of the pressure so.as to define the physical state of the steam hereinafter, therefore, we shali use the two magnitudes equally to indicate said physical state. For the sterilization cycle the saturated steam is delivery ed into a sterilization chamber where the material or charge hns already been introduced for sterilization, and steam is delivered in quantities such as to saturate the enclosed atmosphere in said sterilization chamber. A suitable relationship between the temperature of the sterilization atmosphere satured with steam and the time said saturation is maintained in said atmosphere determines the success of the sterilization cycle, that is, the steriliz ation of said charge. However, it is essential to carry out sterilization in a saturated atmosphere, for the presence of pockets of air inside said chamber creates conditions of insufficient sterilization or, indeed, of non steriliz .ation. Said presence of air is to be found, above all, when the charge to be sterilized consists, as is usually the case, of porous materials such as cloths or fabrics employed in hospitals or in medical circles in general which are most likely to hold air bubbles. Monitoring of the sterilization cycle, according to known techniques, can be carried out with a control of a biological type or with a control by physical methods of colour change. The control of a biological type employs appropriate hold ers containing microbic cultures possibly in combination with other organic components. Said holders are distributed in sufficient numbers and in an even way, or according to what may be deemed to be an.optimum distribution, inside the sterilization chamber and,.where possible, amid the charge. When the sterilization cycle has been completed, the holders are withdrawn and broken so that the culture broth can come into contact with the microbic culture, and the whole is kept in incubation for a given time. Under such conditions, if there are micro organisms still alive, they grow and reproduce themselves, thus determining in a known way a colour change in the culture broth a thing which does not happen if alla the icro organisms are dead .In such a case it is necessary to repeat the cycle and therefore to repeat the biological control with the employment of further cartridges or holders. There are other methods to carry out the controls all of them may require a possible repetition of the sterilization cycle if the results of the control are not satisfactory. Said known procedures are especially unhelpful because of the great cost of the individual control units, the waiting times needed to know the outcome of the control and the possible necessity of repeating the cycle. The times of said known cycles are very long, being deter mined by the time taken to develop the basic components which are used in the control unit and which indicate any microorganisms possibly remaining after the sterilization, and by the time employed in checking the control results, and also by the time possibly taken up in repeating the cycle. A further drawback of these control methods lies in the difficu ty of carrying out the procedure itself. The control of sterilization with physical colour change methods of the Bowie Dick type, for instance, envisages the analyzer device being disposed in the middle of the charge to the sterilized and, then, to be analysed, whereby the middle of said charges forms the most critical or most dis .advantageous position. In fact, said zone is the hardest for the saturated steam to reach and is therefore suitable for being used to accomplish a uniform control of the steriliz ation of the charge. When control methods of the physical colour change type are employed, the Bowie Dick analyzer is withdrawn after carrying out the sterilization cycle if said analyzer shows a distinclty dark colouring over all its sensitive bands, it is inferred that the sterilization has a very high percentage of likelihood of success. If said analyzer shows a light colouring in its middle bands, it is deduced that the sterilization has an unacceptable percentage of likelihood of success from the point of view of sterility of the charge, and in this event it is best to repeat the cycle and the control. Colourings in between the foregoing have diverse like lihoods of success. te type of control we have just described is less accurate than the previous one but is less expensive. In this kind of control, even slight shadings of colour in the sensitive bands of the Bowie Dick analyzer, shadings which are not appraised by the human eye, can show that in the sterilization chamber there is enough air to enable the bacteria to stay alive, thus making the sterilization ineffective. The main purpose of our invention is to realize a control procedure which is economical, requires only a short time for analysis or verification and is extremely accurate. The author has verified with laboratory tests the appropriateness of using the homogeneity or, contrariwise, the lack of homogeneity of the steam in the sterilization atmosphere as an effective term or reference point for an evaluation analysis of the degree of penetration of the steam into the charge. The author himself has therefore developed a control procedure which, by using the device of the invention, makes possible a verification which is overall and therefore not done poin by point and immediate in actual time of the homogenization or non homegenization of the saturated atmosphere. The procedure we propose is based on the principle that the greater the percentage of steam in a given volume of gas, the faster said volume of gas in which the steam is present will reach saturation poin and, therefore, the beginning of condensation. Thus, for instance, a quantity of gas which is 70 saturated with steam will reach 1000a saturation point at a temperature higher than the same quantity of gas only 30 saturated with steam. This physical principle being constant or almost constant, the content of the atmosphere within which the sterilization of the charge takes place enables us to determine, by measuring the temperature of condensation or by measuring the temperature of the atmosphere in which the condensation is caused, the degree of saturation of the atmosphere in which the sterilization takes place. The author has therefore embodied a device suitable for the pratical application of said physical principle and which therefore enables said procedure to be carried out. According to the invention a mixture of air and steam existing in the sterilization chamber is made to pass three ugh a suitable device. As the less saturated the air, the colder the air steam mixture, said mixture will tend to be placed in defined positions in the sterilization chamber.This enables a preferential path to be imposed on said mixture in the presence of a continous feed of saturated steam. This preferential path cooperates with the device of the invention in a coordinated manner. In said device said air steam mixture is saturated until condensation of the steam is brough about. Therefore, from the beginning to the end of the sterilization cycle steam forming part of a more and more saturated air steam mixture will be condensed in the device of the invention, and this will go on until said mixture is one hundred per cent saturated. Under such conditions the condensating temperature tends to stay constant or substantially constant. Before reaching the constant or almost constant condensation temperature, we can find ourselves in the presence even of considerable falls of temperature when pockets of air are removed owing to the action of the saturated steam. Other variants shown by a temperature recording may indicate that equipment is not working properly, that packings are not tight, that slits or other defects are present in the chamber, etc., each of such shortcomings being quickly and reaily identifiable. The greater the quantity of air inside the chamber and the greater the quantity of air in the air steam mixture, therefore, the colder the residual air collected in the in Invention. In actual fact, to small falls i temperature and therefore to small variations in the degree of non homogenization within the sterilization chamber there correspond more significant falls in temperature which can be measured in the device of the invention. As said earlier, such a device behaves substantially like an amplifier of falls or variations in temperature or like an amplifier of non homogenization. The invention, therefore, consists in a procedure for monitoring non homogenization inside sterilization chambers. with an atmosphere of any desired gas, within which the ste rilizing effect is obtained advantageously with steam, said. procedure being characterized by the fact that the gas steam mixture is made to pass at least partially through a device. wherein it is cooled, thus obtaining its condensation, while the temperature is read of the place where the condensation takes place, the value of said temperature being used to show the conditions inside the sterilization chamber. According to the invention the temperature can be measur ed continously or periodically. According to the invention optical or analogue means can be comprised to indicate the temperature and can plotit or otherwise. Further according to the invention the conditions inside the sterilization chamber are translated into real time op optical or sonic alarm signals indicative of the real state of homogenization within said chamber. Moreover, the invention is embodied in a device suit able for realizing the procedure for monitoring non homogen ization inside sterilization chambers having an atmosphere of any desired gas, wherein the sterilizing effect is bb tained advantageously with steam. and said device cooper ates with the sterilization chamber and is characterized by comprising a delivery conduit cooperating with a conden sation chamber wherein there is a thermometer monitoring means, whereby there are cooling means and a channel means to equalize pressure and perhaps to carry out drainage, and whereby said channel means and said at least partially cool ed delivery conduit form a closed circuit cooperating in a coordinated manner with a conduit connected to said steril ization chamber. Further according to the invention therebeing provided an external optical or sonic alarm device, connected to said monitoring means, suitable for displaying instantaneous op . tical indications or giving sonic signals indicative of the. instantÅaneous state of homogenization within the steriliz ation chamber.The attached tables show diagrammatically and as an example one type of non restrictive ambodiment of the device of the.invention. Fig. 1 shows with a diagram of blocks the control or reg ulation of the sterilization cycle Fig. 2 gives a graph with curves of the temperatures ex pressed as a function of time and measured inside the sterilization chamber, and with curves of the temperatures expressed once again ad a funcion of time and measured as responses at the output of the device Fig. 3 shows a true development of the responses as a function of time in correspondence with diverse values of loss of pressure inside the sterilization chamber Fig. 4 gives the response in time during the actual ster ilization phase itself Fig. 5 shows a view of a section of the device employing the physical principle to which the invention re fers. In Fig. 1 is shown the diagram of blocks of the control and regualtion of the sterilization cycle. Actual sterilization takes place inside the sterilization chamber 10 and is monitored in real time by the trans ducer 11 consisting of the device adopting the invention. The output signal from the transducer is compared in a monitoring and or regulating unit 12 with signals of a pre set value. Said unit sends out a command signal, which is suitably converted by the transducer 13 and serves to pilot the actuation organs 14 able to generate conditions of sterilization inside the chamber 10. The flow lines connecting the various blocks show the preferential path followed by the control signals. Fig. 2 shows graphs of the temperatures, as a function of time, of the steam inside the sterilization chamber and of the residual air inside the device of the invention. The variations in temperature or, as we said earlier, the variations in pressure of the saturated steam inside the chamber are shown with continuous lines in Fig. 2. In particular the sterilization process envisages a preliminary phase of empting and charging the chamber 10 with saturated steam so as to obtain thereafter better filling of the said chamber 10 with steam. This phase is shown in Fig. 2 with the initial tract having an impulsive form. Saturated steam is the injected once more into the chamber 10 and the temperature and pressure of said steam is increased until it reaches the optimum value known for sterilization with satured steam this value can be, for instance, 1340C. This temperature is mainteined for the whole of the sterilization phase, at the end of which conditions of vacuum are created so as to dry the charge in the chamber 10. Said conditions of vacuum are shown in the end tract of the graph with a pressure value of minus 700 mm. Hg. The graphs of the control signals given with lines of dashes in Fig. 2 are obtained by using the device 21 shown diagrammatically in Fig. 5. Inside the device 21 the steam discharged from the chamber 10 passes through the discharge pipe 15 and penetrates into the delivery conduit or condensate pipe 16. The cooling water which runs through the cooling coil 17 causes said steam to condense in the condensation chamber or air collection pipe 18, or in 16, and said condensed.steam runs in the form of drops into the equalizer channel or compensating pipe 20. Any air present in the steam will then be pushed by the flow of steam coming from the sterilization chamber towards the higher part of the condensate pipe 16 and then into the air collection pipe 18. As air is denser than steam, it will flow to the bottom of the air collecting pipe 18, where it will be concentrated, for its re circulation in hindered by the water present in the compensating pipe 20. In said compensating pipe 20 a monitoring thermometer 19, of a thermocouple type for instance, is disposed above the water level and measures the variations in temperature, converting them in this example into variations of tension and then into electric signals which can be taken bu a suitable output outside said compensating pipe 20. The greater the quantity of air in the steam inside the chamber 10, the greater the drop in temperature which can be measured with the thermocouple 19, or the greater the non homogenization of the steam inside the chamber 10, the greater the variation in the output signal of the thermocouple 19. In actual fact, greater output signals correspond to small variations in homogeneity, so that, as we said earlier, the device of the invention behaves like an amplifier of non homogenization. Going back to the sterilization cycle of Fig. 2, we can see that three responses have been plotted with regard to as many inputs, said responses having been conditioned by differing degrees of non homogenization within the chamber 10. Let us now loog at a non restrictive example referring to specific losses of pressure. Let us consider a loss of pressure of one to two mm. Hg per minete during the phase of vacuum in the chamber 10. In the first tract of the graph the response tends, with a certain inertia, to follow the temperature pulsations or pressure pulsations imposed on the steam, whereby said oscillations, however, have a minimum value of temperature which can be estimated experimentally to be about 50 C. In the middle part of the graph relating to the actual sterilization period itself the response follows the variations in the input magnitude almost faithfully and with an inertia which can be overlooked. The end part of the cycle is not relevant for the purposes of the invention and is therefore not taken into account by us now or hereinafter. If there is a pressure loss of 2 to 3 mm. Hg per minute in the chamber during the vacuum phase, the response given by the invention follows the variations in the input magnitudes with a greater inertia. Said response in the part of the graph concerned has oscillations with ery modest peacks as compared to the input, as shown in Fig. 2 in the middle part the response is stabilized at a value which can be comprised between about 110 and 75 C. In the third condition with losses greater than 3 mm.Hg per minute the response tends to be kept almost constant at about a minimum value of 70 C value of minimum threshold . These responses enable us to pick out three distinct control zones Fig. 4 . If the temperature inside the chamber is 134 C and the loss of pressure therein is not more than 2 mm. Hg. per minute, the invention indicates a temperature of about 134 C. It has been ascertained in the author s laboratories that said response indicates safe sterilization. If there is a loss of pressure of 2 to 3 mm. Hg per minute within the chamber at a temperature of 134 C, the device of the invention measures a temperature defined with in a range of values which indicate a zone of risk owing to the uncertainity of success of the sterilization. If If there is a loss of pressure greater than 3 mm. Hg per minute within the chamber at a temperature of 134 C, the device of the invention indicates a temperature definied below the minimum value in this case the sterilization has not succeded. The invention, therefore, makes it possible not only to amplify a signal correlated, as said earlier, to non homogenization whithin the chamber 10, but also to make clear, in real time, the result of the process monitoring the ster ilization by discriminating between three kinds of responses which, depending on the results obtained in output, and in relation to the three aforesaid ranges of values, are successful sterilization uncertain sterilization and un successful sterilization. In fact to enhance the invention s real time monitoring potential and its utility it is proposed to provide the device according the invention with an alarm device connected dire ctly to the output of the monitoring and or regulating unit 12. Said alarm device may be a visual display capable of switch ing on one of three differently coloured indicator lights each indicator right being associated with one of the above mentioned working conditions. Namely, a green light for successful sterilization a yellow light for uncertain sterilization and red light for an unsuccsseful sterilization. The said alarm device may on the other hand be a visual display on which said conditions are indicated in writing. On further type of alarm that can be used is a sonic alarm device which emits three types of audible signals whose respective frequencies or amplitudes correspond each to one of the three states of sterilization mentioned hereinabove. The sonic alarm device may be activated manually or may go into action only when it is necessary to warn the operator. Following on such considerations, we can define the device of the invention as a discriminating amplifier of non homogenization. Fig. 3 shows the graphical development of the true response of the device 21 with reference to the aforesaid nonrestrictive example, corresponding to the zone of the beginning of sterilization. With said graph we can ascertain whether during the beginning phase said phase of homogenization there are in the chamber such losses as to cause the cycle for obtaining sterilization to be halted. If said graph shows a starting peak of an amplitude which can be estimated to be about 1340 C, this being the temperature used for the sterilization phase, as we said earlier, this means that the chamber 10 is in a condition to perform sterilization properly. If said peak has an amplitude positioned in the zone of risk or corresponding to minimum values or to values the same as the minimum, it is best to check and put right any losses of pressure in the chamber 10 or any introduction of steam containing too much air. The diverse slopes of the true curves shown in Fig. 3, obtained at the output of the device of Fig. 5 and estimated for various losses of pressure in the chamber 10, being expressed in mm. Hg. per minute and referring to a pre set volume V of the chamber 10, are due to the fact that the steam introduced into the chamber 10 during sterilization always contains some parts of air in actual fact. Therefore, the device 21 deduced by the invention en enables the degree of non homogeneity, as defined earlier, to be kept under continual or periodical surveillance control, monitoring even during the whole phase of sterilization. We have described here a procedure and a device 21 able to embody said procedure, but variants are possible. Thus the proportions, values and sizes can be varied and parts can be added or integrated the non essential shapes can pe varied and the conduit 16 can have any desired sha pe the conduit 16 can be at least partially insulated cooling 17 can take place in the chamber 18 and can be.obtained in any desired manner, etc. These and other variants are all possible for a technician in this field.
