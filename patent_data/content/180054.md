# DUAL ENDED ADAPTIVE FOLDED BITLINE SCHEME

## Abstract
A scheme for addressing memory cells in random ac cess memory arrays includes bitlines BL1, BL2 divided into a plurality of segments. Each pair of bitlines BL1, BL2 has a sense amp at each end coupled to both bitlines in the pair. Word lines WL address memory cells 53, 55 coupled to each bitline of the pair. When a pair of memory cells 53, 55 is accessed, the bitlines BL1, BL2 are electrically di vided so that one memory cell 53 is coupled to one sense amp 1 through one bitline BL1 and the other memory cell 55 is coupled to the other sense amp 2 through the other bitline BL2 . The memory cells 53, 55 can be coupled to the bitlines through segment lines 52 with each segment line 52 connecting to a subset of the memory cells to a bitline BL1, BL2 in order to reduce capacitances presented to the sense amps. An alternating linear array of sense amps and bitline pairs can be used to increase overall density of the memory array by allowing sense amps to access more than one bitline pair. The bitlines are address ed so that each sense amp receives data from only one bitline pari at a time.
