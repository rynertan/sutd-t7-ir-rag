# Computer system.

## Abstract
A parallel computer system having a primary task processor with an associated backup task processor and a second primary task processor also with an associated backup task processor. Each processor has a task perfom ing memory and there is a message bus. The computer is operated so that messages sent from the primary task processor to the secondary task processor, the secondary task processor operating on the messages received by initially storing a received message in a queue and thereaf ter reading the message from the queue for processing in accordance with the task, the second primary task proces sor accumulating a count of the messages read from this queue. Messages are sent from the primary task processor to the backup processor for the secondary task processor, this backup processor storing messages also in a message queue.
