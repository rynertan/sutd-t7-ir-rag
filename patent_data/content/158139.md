# Error corrected corpuscular beam lithography.

## Abstract
To test transmission masks 3 for electron or ion beam lithography, the corpuscular beam 2 is inclined to guide the shadow image of a mask portion across a pinhole diaphragm 20, 40 comprising at least one aperture with submicron dimensions. The test for geometrical errors is effected with a single hole diaphragm 20 arranged above a scintillator 21 connected to a photomultiplier 22 the single hole dia phragm is positioned below selected measuring points of the exposure mask to determine the accurate position of the measuring point relative to the diaphragm by beam tilting. The relative spacing of two measuring points is derived from the interferometrically measured table displacement and the beam inclination. To test the entire mask area for errors and impurity particles, a multihole diaphragm 40 is used having submicron apertures arranged in matrix fashion above an integrated circuit of the charge transfer type which provides a MOS capacitor as a particle detector underneath each dia phragm opening. The exposure mask is scanned in steps, effecting several single exposures at each position by inclin ing the beam.
