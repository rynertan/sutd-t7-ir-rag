# Curable compositions containing epoxy resins and salicyloyl hydrocarbylamines and cured compositions thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention concerns curable compositions containing epoxy resins and salicyloyl hydrocarbyl amines, such as N,N disalicyloyl 1,2 propylenediamine, and cured compositions thereof. The cured resins have an improve ment in one or more properties such as color, tensile strength and flexural strength or improved pot life when compared to amine curing agents such as methylene dianiline.
