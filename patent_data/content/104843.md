# TRANSDUCER DEVICE

## Abstract
The transducer device 10 comprises a plurality of transducer elements 12 to 18 each producing on receipt of a signal from object 20 an electrical signal, differential amplifiers 72, 82, 92, 102 responding to each electrical signal to convert it into two resultant signals one in phase and the other out of phase with the electrical signal, range sensing means 150 sensing the distance of the device from the object and producing an output signal when the device is at a distance at which the polarity of the electrical signals interfer with one inner, switch means 110 124 receiving the resultant signals and the output signal and operable to pass said in phase signals for summation in summer 146 and upon receipt of said output signal to pass for summation with said in phase signals at least one of the out of phase signals while blocking the corresponding in phase signal whereby to increase the value of the summed signals.
