# Ultrasonic rangefinder.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic rangefinder which measures distance to the ground by transmitting ultrasonic waves toward the ground and measuring the time which elapses until the reflected wave is received is shown. In order to reliably prevent errone ous measurement due to ultrasonic waves which travel to the receiver directly without striking the ground, the distance calculation is based on the time which elapses after transmis sion of the ultrasonic wave until the rate of change of the envelope of the received ultrasonic wave signal exceeds a prescribed value.

## Description
ULTRASONIC RANGEFINDERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an ultrasonic rangefinder and more paticularly to an ultrasonic rengefinder in which ultrasonic waves are transmitted toward the ground and the time necessary for the reflected wave to return is used to estimate the distance to the ground. Technologies for an ultrasonic rangefinder which transmits ultrasonic waves downward from a vehicle toward the ground, receives the reflected waves from the ground, and uses the time from transmission to reception to measure the distance to the ground, and for an ultrasonic speedmeter which uses the frequency shift between the frequency of the transmitted waves and the frequency of the received reflected waves to measure the speed of the vehicle relative to the ground, are shown in the prior art, for example,Utility Model Published Application Sho 57 No. 68575. In this kind of rangefinder there are at least two causes which produce spurious waves. One of them is an attenuation signal which is generated when the ultrasonic signal leaves a trace in the transmitter microphone or in the receiver microphone. The other is the signal which travels directly from the transmitter microphone to the receiver microphone. Since the latter spurious wave is always delayed by a fixed time with respect to the transmitted wave, its effect can be eliminated by determining that time and removing signals received within that time of the transmission of the transmitted wave.However, until now there has been a problem in that the attenuation signal in the transmitter microphone and the detour signal mentioned above leave traces in the receiver microphone which overlap with the desired reflected signal, causing undersirable side effects.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Anobject of this invention is to provide an ultrasonic rangefinder in which erroneous measurement is not caused by such effects as the spurious detour signal. Another object of this invention is to provide an ultrasonic rangefinder in which the desired reflected wave can be reliably distinguished from the spurious signal. In order to accomplish the above ojbects, in this invention, in an ultrasonic rangefinder which measures the distance to the ground by transmitting ultrasonic waves toward the ground and measuring the time which elapses until the reflected waves are received, the distance calculation is based on the time from the transmission of the ultrasonic wave until the time at which the rate of change of the envelope of the waveform of the reflected wave exceeds a prescribed value.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional type of ultrasonic rangefinder.

Fig. 1 shows an example of a conventional ultrasonic rangefinder of this type and signal waveforms at various locations in the conventional rangfinder are depicted inFigs. 2 A through 2 F . An oscillator 1 generates a transmitted wave S1 the freqauency of which matches the resonant frequency of the transmitter microphone 2 and the receiver microphone 3. The ultrasonic wave R1 travels to the object of measurement 10 a distance h from the transmitter microphone 2 in a time tT The ultrasonic waveR1 which is reflected from the object of measurement 10, is received by the receiver microphone 3, converted to an electrical signal and input to the amplifier 4. The reflection signal S2 which is amplified by the amplifier 4 enters the detection and smoothing circuit 5. Here the envelope signal S3 shown in Fig. 2 C is obtained.This signal S3 is compared with the reference voltage D generated by the reference voltage generator 7 in the comparator 6.When the level of the signal S3 exceeds the reference voltage D the judgment signal S4 is output. The envelope signal S3 includes a part E1 which is formed by the 83 includes a part E1 reflected wavereferred to below as the reflected output E1 , and another part E2 which is formed by the output 2 detour wave which enters the receiver microphone 3 directly from the transmitter microphone 2 referred to below as the detour output E2 . Meanwhile, the AND circuit 9 forms the logical product of the mask signal Sg, which is caused to rise a time E after the transmitted wave S1 by the time delay circuit 8, and the judgment signal S4, and outputs said logical product as the AND output signal 86. The number of pulses from the clock 14, which starts upon transmission of the ransmitted wave S1, is output by the latch circuit 12 with the timing of the output 86 from the AND circuit 9, that is, with the time width t. The time width t varies in response to the distance h since it is the arrival time of the reflected output E1.The distance h can be calculated from the time width t on the basis of the period of the clock 14 and the speed of sound by the calculator 15. After latching the counter 11 is reset through the time delay circuit 13. The speed of sound in air is given by the following formula when the air temperature is T c 331 0.607T m s The ultrasonic waves travel a distance 2h in the time t. Therefore the distance h can be found from the following formula h ct 2 m However, in the rangefinder, as shown in Fig. 3, while part of the ultrasonic wave transmitted from the transmitter microphone 2 toward the object of measurement 10 strikes the object 10 and is reflected as the ultrasonic wave R1, which enters the receiver microphone 3, part does not reach the object 10 but detours directly from the transmitter microphone 2 to the receiver microphone 3 as the detour component R2. This is because the transmitter microphone 2 and the receiver microphone 3 are not perfectly directional so that some transmitting and receiving are done even at 900 to the intended direction of wave travel.Since the travel times of these two ultrasonic waves R1, and R2 are different from each other, as can be easily seen fromFig. 2 the detour output E2 due to the detour wave R2 appears at a different time. than the refelction output E1 due to the ultrasonic wave R1, which is reflected from the 1 object of measurement 10. Moreover, since the travel path of the detour wave R2 is always the same, the detour output E2 always appears within a fixed time after the transmission of the transmitted wave S1. For this reason, as is shown in Fig.4, as the distance h gradually increases, in the envelope of the signal S3 the time until the reflection output E1 appears gradually increases, as shown by the times tl, t2 and t3 in Fig. 4 A , B and C respectively but the time until the detour output E2 appears does not vary. Since this detour output E2 is not needed for a distance measurement, it is removed by the time delay circuit 8 and the AND circuit 9, and only the rise of the reflection output E1 is detected.The time delay produced by this time delay circuit 8 is nearly determined by the travel time of the ultrasonic waves, but, since the frequency of the transmitted wave S1 is made to resonate with the transmitter microphone 2 and the receiver microphone 3 in order to increase output, the signal S2 does not rise as sharply as the transmitted wave S1, and attenuation vibrations remain, leaving a trace. The magnitude of these attenuation vibrations is determined by the sharpness Q of the resonance of the transmitter microphone 2 and the receiver microphone 3 and changes very little. For this reeason the time delay t is set to a value which leaves plenty of leeway for the detour output E2 due to these attenuation vibrations to become much smaller than the reference voltage D. However, since the Q of the transmitter microphone and the receiver microphone is set to a large value in this type of ultrasonic rangefinder, the attenuation vibration of the received signal are slso large, so that the overlap between the detour output E2 and the reflection output E1 becomes large and the rise of the reflection output E1 becomes difficult to detect.Occasionally the detour output E2 is mistaken for the reflection output El giving an erroneous distance measurement. Now the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of a rangefinder in which this invention is applied. The embodiment has a differentiation circuit 16 which differentiate the envlope E which is output from the detection and amplifier circuit 5 of the rangefinder shown in Fig. 1. The output S3, of the differentiation circuit 16 is compared with the reference voltage D from the reference voltage generator 15 in the comparator 6. Other circuit components are the same as inFig. 1. Figs. 6 A through 6 F show the signal waveforms at various locations in the circuitry of the rangefinder shown in Figs. 5. Those signals which are the same as in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are shown with the same symbols. The signal S3 in Fig. 6 C is obtained by differentiating the envelope of the signal S3 which is output from the detector and amplifier circuit 5. This signal S3 is compared with the reference voltage D from the reference voltage generator 15 in the comparator 6, which outputs the judgment signal 84 shown in Fig. 6 D . After that the judgment is performed in the same manner as in the conventional type of rangefinder shown in Fig. 1 refere to Fig. 6 E and F . This solves the problem of erroneous measurement due to the detour output E2. How it does so will now be explained with reference to Figs. 7 and Figs. 8. Figs. 7 A through 7 E show signal waveforms in the existing type of rangefinder while Figs. 8 A through 8 F show signal waveforms in a rangefinder in accordance with this invention. The detour output E2 arising from the detour ultrasonic wave R2 from the transmitter microphone 2 to the receiver microphone 34 is determined by the directionality of the microphone. This directionality in turn is greatly affected by the physical shape of the microphone. When this rangefinder is used as a vehicle height sensor, if mud gets on the microphone during operation it is essentially the same as a change in the shape of the microphone and the detour output can increase. Supposing that the detour waveR2 increases, the detour output E2 increases from the solid line to the dotted line in Fig. 7 B .At this time the attenuation vibrations of the microphone are large, so that the time interval during which the detour output E2 is larger than the reference voltage D becomes longer, and, as a result, the judgment signal S3 becomes longer, as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 7 C . This causes the judgment signal S4 to persist beyond the time delay t so that the output of the AND circuit 9 does not have the normal time delay t but rather has the same time width as the time delay t of the mask signal Sg, causing erroneous distance measurement. In contrast, in the present invention, as shown in AFigs. 8, even if the detour output E2 increases causing the attenuation vibrations to increase, the attenuation vibrations do not appear in the differentiated output E so that there is little if any change in the time width of the A A judgment signal S4 so that the output S6 of the AND circuit 9 has the correct time width t. The reference voltage D can be as small as 0, in fact, this gives the least error. In the embodiment described above the envelope of the reflected wave is differentiated and the derivative is detected as a means of accurately detecting the reflection output, it is also possible to achieve the same objective by differentiating the differentiated output once more to obtain the second derivative and then detecting the second derivatived. It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates only to preferred embodiments of the present invention and that numerous modifications or alterations may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
