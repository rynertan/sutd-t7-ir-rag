# Franking machine adapted to print variable data.

## Abstract
A franking machine adapted to print variable data as well as constant data onto mail as it is presented to the machine has a printing mechanism for printing at least the variable data which comprises a plurality of endless bands of self inking material containing printing indicia around their ex ternal surfaces a separate drive means for each band for advancing same to present different ones of said printing indicia to the printing station microprocessor means adapted to control the operation of the separate drive means transducer means adapted to produce an electrical signal indicative of the position to which a band has moved at any instant relative to a reference position and, means for feed ing to the microprocesser the said electrical signal or signals derived therefrom whereby the microprocessor is continually made aware of the position occupied by each movable band.
