GB A 0 620 693 discloses a copolymer of methyl vinyl polysiloxane and methyl methacrylate, which is produced by polymerization of a mixture of methyl vinyl polysiloxane CH₃ CH₂ CH SiO The present inventors have intensively studied to obtain a process for producing a novel polymer having excellent migration property easily and with low cost, and have found that a novel silicon containing polymer having a comb shaped structure which comprises an organopolysiloxane as the main chain and a vinyl polymer as the side chain and having desirable excellent properties can be produced by polymerizing a vinyl monomer by using a mercaptosilane compound containing a dialkoxysilyl group as a chain transfer agent to obtain a polycondensable macromonomer containing a dialkoxysilyl group at the terminus and polycondensing the resulting macromonomer alone or together with a specific dialkoxysilane compound.

Another object of the invention is to provide an intermediate alkoxysilyl group containing polycondensable macromonomer suitable for production of said comb shaped polymer. According to the present invention the silicon containing comb shaped polymer comprising a unit of the formula I can be produced by polymerizing a vinyl monomer of the formula wherein R and X¹ are as defined above, by using a mercaptosilane compound of the formula wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are as defined above, as a chain transfer agent optionally in the presence of a radical initiator to obtain an intermediate macromonomer of the formula II which has a dialkoxysilyl group at the terminus, and polycondensing the intermediate macromonomer II alone or together with a dialkoxysilane compound of the formula wherein R⁵ and X² are as defined above, and R⁶ and R⁷ are the same or different and are each an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, optionally in the presence of a polycondensation catalyst.

These other vinyl monomers may be used alone or in combination thereof instead of or together with the vinyl monomers of the formula III . The dialkoxysilane compound V which is optionally used in this invention is used for improving the properties e.g. adhesion of the final comb shaped polymer by introducing a functional group into the main chain thereof.

The dialkoxysilane compound V is usually used in an amount of 0.01 to 5 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the macromonomer II . In order to improve the water repellency of the product, dialkyldialkoxysilanes are preferably used, and in order to improve the adhesion of the product, dialkoxysilanes containing a group suitable for giving adhesion e.g. NH₂, SH, etc. are preferably used. Thus, the comb shaped polymer comprising the unit of the formula I produced according to the present invention includes both of the product produced by using the dialkoxysilane compound V and the product produced without using the dialkoxysilane compound. The process for the production thereof is explained in more detail below. In the above polycondensation reaction, the reaction system become viscous in case of solution polymerization, and then, the solvent is removed in a usual manner to give the desired comb shaped polymer as a solid substance at room temperature or as a highly viscous oily substance. In case of using butyl acrylate as the vinyl monomer, the comb shaped polymer is obtained as a highly viscous substance having a low glass transition temperature, but in other cases, the polymer is obtained as a glass like white powdery solid substance. The comb shaped polymer can easily be produced by a comparatively simple two step reaction even by single step under a certain condition as mentioned above . Besides, the polymer has excellent migration property and hence can give improvement of properties e.g. stain resistance of surface or interface of substances to which the polymer is applied even in a small amount. Moreover, the comb shaped polymer having a functional group of a dialkoxysilane compound V in the main chain shows excellent properties such as water repellency, adhesion, etc. Owing to the excellent properties, the comb shaped polymer is useful as an agent for giving water repellency to paints, an agent for giving adhesion particularly suitable for applying to glass or glass made materials , a releasing agent, and further an agent for giving surface activity. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples. MMA 8 g , octafluoropentyl methacrylate 2 g , 3 mercaptopropyl methyldimethoxysilane 0.01 g , toluene 2 g and AIBN 0.01 g are subjected to polymerization reaction at 60 C for 8 hours to give a copolymer resin. The resin is mixed with n butyl tin oxide 0.05 g , and the mixture is applied onto a surface of glass plate and is allowed to stand at room temperature for 7 days. As the result, the product comb shaped polymer shows excellent water repellency and also oil repellency. In the same manner as described in Example 1 1 heat polymerization, at 60 C , in Example 2 1 photopolymerization and in Example 1 2 polycondensation except that the ingredients as shown in Table 1 are used, there are produced various comb shaped polymers. In all Examples, the used chain transfer agent is 3 mercaptopropyl methyldimethoxysilane.
