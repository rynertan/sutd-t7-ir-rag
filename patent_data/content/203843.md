# REDUCED CALORIE CRACKERS

## Abstract
Reduced calorie crackers are produced from dough com positions comprising 25 70 percent of flour, 0 20 percent of gluten, 0 10 percent fat or shortening, 5 20 percent of a water soluble polydextrose, 0 5 percent of one or more emulsifiers, 0.5 5 percent of a leavening system comprising yeast and a carbon dioxide releasing material, and 1.5 10 percent of a cel lulosic bulking agent, all percentages being by weight based upon the total weight of the dough, and the total amount of fat, shortening and emulsifier being 3 10 percent weight of the dough. The crackers may be produced either by a one stage process in which all the ingredients are mixed together prior to fermentation, or by a two stage process using a sponge stage followed by a dough up stage. The crackers are desirably produced, in the one stage process, using a single, rather than a multiple, stage lamination technique.
