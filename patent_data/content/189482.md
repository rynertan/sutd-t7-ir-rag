## Description
SPECIFICATIONTITLE OF THE INVENTION SHAPE MEASURING APPARATUSTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a shape measuring apparatus . forprecisely measuring plane surface, spherical surface or aspherical surface of lens, mirror and the like.BACKGROUND ARTPresently, aspherical lenses are used, for the purpose of being light and low cost, in lenses of precise optical apparatus such as video tape recorder, digital audio disk or the like and camera. Measuring of the shape of aspherical surface of such aspherical lens is generally practiced by the tracer method which is represented by a three dimensions measuring apparatus, the tracer method has a defect of taking time for measuring because of point measurement. Accordingly in recent years, an interference measuring method becomes to be used, which measures the shape of whole aspherical surface without contacting and with high precision by using optical interference. As a typical example of such interference measuring method, a fringe scanning type shearing interference method is reported in RICOH technical report No. 10, 1983 P.4 P.9 , which is a combination of the shearing interference method and the fringe scanning method. FIG.1 is a plan view showing the fundamental constitution of a shape measuring apparatus adopting such pattern scanning type shearing interference method. Operation is briefly elucidated based onFIG.1 a photo beam 2 emitted from a light source 1 passes through beam splitters 5 and 6, after being expanded to a beam of sufficient diameter by a condensor 3 and a colimeter lens 4, and further, enters a measurement object 8 after being transformed into spherical wave by a penetration spherical lens 7. A reflected beam 9 having deviation information between the measurement object 8 and the spherical shape, is divided into a penetrating beam 10 and a reflecting beam 11 by the first beam splitter 6.The penetrating beam 10 is reflected by the second beam splitter 5, and further reflected by a third beam splitter 12, and entering a image sensing device 14 after stopping down the beam by a lens 13. On the other hand, the reflecting beam 11 is reflected by a mirror surface 15, laterally shifted by a parallel plate 16 which is disposed tilted in regard to the optical axis, and enters the image sensing device 14 passing through the third beam splitter 12. The above mentioned two beams produce interference fringe on a image sensing surface of the image sensing device 14. Such interference fringe appears in proportion to differential value of wave surface of the reflected beam 9, so that the deviation of the measurement object 8 from the wave surface can be obtained by integrating such value by R processing device 17. In the above mentioned shape measuring apparatus, the mirror surface 15 is moved very little by a piezo driving apparatus 18 to make a fringe scanning, so as to measure the interference fringe in high precision, and thereby the high precision interference fringe information can be obtained stably in regard to noise of the dispersion of quantity of light of interference fringe or the like. In the above mentioned shape measuring apparatus of the prior art, since the penetrating beam 10 and the reflecting beam 11 of the reflected beam 9 from the measurement object 8 passes through different optical paths, when the change of circumstances of the disturbance of air, the change of temperature or the like occurs, the influences occur in respective optical path and becomes cause of the measuring error. As a result, there was a problem on the control of measuring circumstances. Further, the above mentioned shape measuring apparatus of the prior art is constituted by a large number of parts, so that there were problems on the scattering control of the components and on the cost.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Accordingly, the main purpose of the present invention is to provide a shape measuring apparatus capable of maintaining superior measuring precision in regard to the change of circumstances.

The beam reflected by the measuring object 26 passes through the penetrating spherical lens 25, is relfected by the first beam splitter 24, enters a second beam splitter 27 and a mirror 28 which are disposed almost in parallel, and is divided into two laterally shifted beams by being reflected on respective mirror surface of the second beam splitter 27 and the mirror 28. Further, such state is explained in detail with reference to FIG.3 the light beam entering the second beam splitter 27 is divided into reflection light beam 41 and a penetrating light beam 42 by a coating surface 40. The penetrating light beam 42 is reflected by a mirror surface of a mirror 28 disposed to oppose the second beam splitter 27, and enters the second beam splitter 27 again, and is emitted being laterally.shifted in regard to the reflecting light sic 41. Back to FIG.2, the above mentioned two light beams pass nearly equal optical paths, and enter an image sensing face of a image sensing apparatus 30 after the diameter of such beams is narrowed by a beam transformer lens 29. FIG.4 shows a constitution of processing means of electric signal of the present embodiment, and image of interference fringe transformed into electric signal by the image sensing apparatus 30 is input to a frame memory 50, transformed into digital signal and at the same time displayed on a TV monitor 51. Further, data of interference fringe are inputed to a computer 53 through an interface 52 which computes the shape of the measurement object in accordance with an algorithm programmed beforehand. Back to FIG.2, the mirror 28 is disposed on an air slide 31, and it is constituted so as to move in beeping the parallel state to the second beam splitter 27 by a micrometer 32 and a piezo driving device 33.The fringe scanning is made by changing the quantity of the lateral shifting of the above mentioned two light beams by the micrometer 32 and fine moving of the mirror 28 by the piezo driving device 33. In FIG.4, the scanning quantity of the intereference fringe follows the command from the computer 63, and is controled by driving the piezo driving device 33 through an interface 54, D A transformer 55, and a high voltage amplifier 56. Next, the principles of the shearing interference method and the fringe scanning method are elucidated basing on FIG.5. Now, the following explanation is made in one dimension for simp licity s sake. The reflected light beam from the measurement object 26 has deviation information from the imaginative standard spherical wave face produced by the penetrating spherical lens 25. The optical path difference between such reflective wave surface 60 defined as W x and the wave surface 61 laterally shifted by the quantity of lateral shifting 63 is defined as 62. The interference fringe is generated corresponding to such optical path difference 62 defined as AW x , and in case that the quantity of laterally shifting 63 defined as S is very small, the equation 1 holds W x S x ........ 1 and then, the reflective wave face W x can be obtained by integrating the interference fringe aW x by the computer 53. Next, the fringe scanning method for being out for tE x in high precision is elucidated. By fine moving of the mirror face 28 and changing the phase of the laterally shifted wave surface 61 by one wave length, the intensity of the interference fringe on the arbitrary point of the intereference fringeAW x changes by 2n in a sine curve manner. In such case, as the begining phase is AW x , AW x can be obtained in high precision by sampling the change of intensity of the interference fringe and computing it by the computer 53.Namely, when the phase of the laterally shifted wave surface 61 is changed by N steps for every VN, and measuring the intensity of the intereference fringe Ij x on the arbitrary point X of the intereference fringe N times, AW x is obtained by following equation EMI9.1 Therein, X is the wave length of the light source. refer to the RICOH technical report No.10 1983 P.6 P.7 supra FIG.6 shows the algorithm of measuring the shape by using the apparatus of the embodiment. As the measurement is started, first, after sampling the image of the interference fringe in the frame memory 50 at the predetermined measuring point number of, it is input into the computer 53 step 1 .Next, by moving the piezo device by VN, the image of the interference fringe is input similarly step 2 .By repeating such steps f the time of predetermined moving number N l of the piezo device, and N number of images of the interference fringe are input step 3 . When the inputting is over, the biginning phase value AW x is computed in accordance with the equation 2 step 4 . Next, since QW x takes the value between s and ir, and there is a phase jumping part of 2s between each measuring points, it is corrected step 5 . Furthermore, W x is obtained by integrating the amended AW x step 6 . FIG.7 shows a concrete constitution of the embodiment. Every constituting parts are disposed on a surface plate 100, removed of the affect of vibration, and reduced the change of relative positioning relation between each parts. 101 is a He Ne laser light source, and driven by exclusive high voltage electric source. 102 is a focusing lens, and using a objective lens of the microscope. And 103 is a pin hole, which is disposed nearly the focal point of the focusing lens 102 and corrects the wave face using the measurement.The focusing lens 102 and the pin hole are held by a holder 104, and the positioning relation between them can be adjusted by a micrometer 105. 106 is a reflecting mirror, which turns the optical path nearly 90 degree so as to curtail the space. 107 is a collimator lens, which is constituted by two single lenses. The collimator lens 107 is held by a holder 108, which can adjust the swing and tilt. 109 is a micrometer for adjusting the swing. A first beam splitter 110 is a flat type, and held by holder 111, and it can be adjust the swing and tilt. 112 is a micrometer for adjusting the swing. 113 is a penetrating spherical lens, and for its holder 114 a lock in type one is used because of having a necessity of changing the penetrating spherical lens depending on the shape of measurement object 115, further it can adjust the swing and tilt.The holder 116 of the measurement object 115 has three hooks, so that it can hold the measurement objects having many different diameter. This holder 116 can adjust not only swing and tilt, but also positioning of up and down, and right and left. Further, the holder 116 is disposed on rails 117, movable along the optical axis, and the quantity of movement can be measured by a linar scale.118 is a second beam splitter. 119 is a mirror held by a holder 120, and can adjust the swing and tilt.Further, the holder 120 is fixed on an air slide 121, and can be moved nearly in parallel with the second beam splitter 118 by a micrometer 122 and a piezo device 123. 124 is a beam transformer lens, 125 is a image sensing apparatus, and both of them are held by a holder 126 and the image sensing apparatus 125 can move along the optical axis, so that the size of the interference fringe on the image sensing surface can be changed. Though, the above mentioned FIG.2 showed the case of measuring the shape of a concave surface, but in case of measuring the shape of convex surface, as shown in FIG.8, a measurement object 90 is disposed nearer to a penetrating spherical lens 91 than the focus position 92 of the penetrating spherical lens 91.Furthermore, in case of measuring the shape of plane surface, the penetrating spherical lens 25 in FIG.25 is taken out. Further, FIG.2 shows a prism type as the first beam splitter 24, however, a flat plate type may be used as shown in FIG.7. And the beam transformer lens 29 is not necessary, in case the image sensing surface of the image sensing apparatus 30 has sufficient space for entering the interference fringe. Further, though in this embodiment the fringe scanning is made by moving the mirror 28, it is needless to say that the moving of the second beam splitter 27 may be made.INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY As mentioned above, in accordance with the present invention, since the laterally shifting of the wave surface is made by the beam splitter and mirror disposed opposing each other, and the fringe scanning is made by fine moving of at least one of the mirror face or beam splitter, the constitution becomes simple, and the two laterally shifted beams pass nearly the same optical path, so that it is stable in regard to the change of circumstances, and can measure the shape in high precision.
