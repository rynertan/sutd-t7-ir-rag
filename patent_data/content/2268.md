# Cell connector for bipolar electrolyzer.

## Abstract
A cell connector for insuring direct electrical communication and positive mechanical connection with a cell in a bipolar permselective membrane electrolyzer, and which precludes fluid or gaseous flow therefrom, is comprised of an electrically non conductive cell web 32 , an electrically conductive insert 36 disposed in an aperture in the web, an electrode boss bearing a cell electrode on one face and disposed adjacent the insert at a second face defining an electrode interface, an electrically conductive fastener 44 disposed through a bore in the insert and received in mating engagement with the electrode boss for providing an axial compressive force at the electrode interface, and a biasing member 60 in operative engagement with the fastener for providing a force in opposition to the axial compressive force.
