# Electrode structure for electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
An electrode assembly adaptor to be wound on a spool 21 to provide a battery stack 20 for an electrochemical cell. The spool 21 has a central post 25 of insulating material and two conductive flanges 22 and 23 . The elec trode assembly includes two elongated electrode struc tures, and anode electrode structure 32 and a cathode current collector electrode structure 31 . Each electrode structure 32,31 includes a metal substrate 41, 35 having deflective, resilient contact tabs 42, 36 spaced along one edge 43, 37 . An appropriate electrode material 46, 40 is adherent to the substrate 41, 35 . The electrode assembly of the two electrode structures 32, 31 with intervening insulating material 33 is adapted to be wound around the post 25 of the spool 21 with the contact tabs 42 of the anode electrode structure 32 making contact with one of the flanges 22 and with the contact tabs 36 of the cathode current collector electrode structure 31 making contact with the other flange 23 .
