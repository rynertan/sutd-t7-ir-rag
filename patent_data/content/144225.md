A vehicle is provided with hydraulic mechanism 1,2,3,4 capable of loading a transport frame 6 having at the front end thereof an upstanding member 5 for cooperation with the hydraulic mechanism 1,2,3,4 . The transport frame 6 is provided with anchor members 10 which cooperate with hooks 26 and latches 30 to lock the transport frame 6 direct to the main chassis members 7 of the vehicle. The transport frame is also provided at the rear end thereof with a platform 51 which supports a fifth wheel coupling 55,56,57,58 . The platform also supports two ramps 62 and 63 used in loading the frame onto the vehicle. When the transport frame 6 is loaded on to, and locked to, the vehicle, the vehicle can be used to pull a trailer having a dependent king pin capable of being secured in the fifth wheel coupling.
