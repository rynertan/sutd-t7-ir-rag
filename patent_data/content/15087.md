# Method for removing solid coronene deposits from the surface of a heat exchange zone in a reforming process.

## Abstract
Coronene deposits are removed from a heat exchange zone 12 of a reforming process by operating the reforming zone 22 at conditions such that at least a portion of the reformer effluent 24 condenses in the heat exchange zone 12 where the coronene deposit occurs. The coronene removal operation may be performed intermittently whenever desirable or necessary.
