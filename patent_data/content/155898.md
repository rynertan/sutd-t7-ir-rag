# Inhibiting polymerization of vinylaromatic monomers.

## Abstract
Vinylaromatic compounds are stabilized against unde sired polymerization by adding to the vinylaromatic com pounds small amounts of zinc or nickel salts of dialkyl dithiocarbamates, specifically p diisopropenylbenzene can be stabilized by the use of zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate.
