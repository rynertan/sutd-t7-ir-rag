# Process for producing benzoyl peroxide crystals of a small size.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for producing benzoyl per oxide in crystalline form with crystals having a size of up to ap proximaely 10 microns, comprising forming a first solution comprising benzoyl peroxide and a precipitate promoting material selected from sulphur con taining aliphatic ethers, long chain aliphatic and araliphatic ethers, ethylene oxide derivatives, and mixtures thereof mixing the first solution with a second solution compris ing an aqueous solution of a non toxic and non reactive dispersant selected from cellulosic derivatives, anionic sur factants, non ionic surfactants, inorganic colloidal materials, and mixtures thereof and recovering the benzoyl peroxide in the desired crystalline form. The process may be performed at room temperature and is therefore safe and energy conservative. The resulting ben zoyl peroxide crystals are of desirable small size, and are parti cularly well suited for incorporation into commercial cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations.
