# Brush control means.

## Abstract
Brush control means for controlling the operative posi tion of a rotary brush 2 or each such brush of a road or like sweeping machine comprises an electronic control 40 operated by a driver s controller 30 for controlling the operation of a valve 50 for in turn controlling the operation of a hydraulic ram 60 connected to the brush mounting 1 for angularly moving the latter laterally about its pivotal mounting 11 from the machine. A sensor such as a linear transducer 70 operated by the ram 60 is responsive to the operative position of the brush mounting 1 as selected by the control unit 40 for operating the valve 50 to hold the ram 60 against operation and hence the brush mounting 1 against outward lateral movement from the selected posi tion. Yieldable continuous low pressure operation 58, 57 of the brush mounting 1 in the outward direction is preferably provided whereby the mounting 1 is able to yield inwardly on the brush 2 encountering an obstacle such as a kerb. The brush mounting 1 may be also protected by a fender 80 arranged to operate a sensor or switch 90 or 98 for effecting operation of the valve 50 through the control unit 40 for causing the ram 60 to move the mounting 1 in negotiating an obstacle. A further sensor 170 may similarly effect ram operation of the brush mounting 1 in response to operation of the steering gear 160, 180 of the machine.
