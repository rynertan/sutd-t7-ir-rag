## Description
METHOD OE DECONTAMINATING METAL SURFACES This invention relates to a method of decontaminating metal surfaces in a cooling system of a nuclear reactor. Deposits which contain radioactive elements are often formed in the cooling systems of nuclear reactors.In order to safely maintain and repair the cooling system, it is necessary to remove these radioactive deposits. This can be accomplished, for example, by using an oxidizing solution of an alkali permanganate followed by a decontamination solution of oxalic acid, citric acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA . These solutions solubilize the radioactive metal ions and the other ions in the deposit. The solutions are circulated between the cooling system and ion exchange resins which then remove the ions from the solution. U.S. Patent ,162,229 discloses the use of cerium IV salts in decontaminating the metal surfaces of nuclear reactors. An acid such as sulfuric or nitric acid can be present. While many effective decontamination and oxidizing solutions have been found, there i s always a need for improved solutions which remove the deposits more readily, are less expensive, or create less waste ion exchange resin. Also, because reactor downtime for removing the deposits is extremely expensive, solutions which can clean the cooling systems more rapidly can save large amounts of money. Another problem in the nuclear industry is the disposal of steam generators at the end of their useful life Because the steam generators are highly radioactive it is necessary to construct an expensive containment building around them to prevent the escape of radiation.Decontamination solutions have not been effective in reducing the radioactivity of these generators to the level required to eliminate the need for a containment building. According to the present invention, a method of decontaminating metal surfaces in a cooling system of a nuclear reactor which comprises contacting said metal surfaces with an aqueous solution containing from 0.5 to 3 of tetrasulfato ceric acid, hexasulfamato ceric acid, hexaperchlorato ceric acid or mixtures thereof, and froml to about 5 of an inorganic acid which forms a complex with said ceric acid. We have discovered that a solution of a complex of a ceric acid and an inorganic acid at a certain particular critical concentration range is extremely effective in removing deposits from the cooling systems of nuclear reactors. The solution is so effective, in fact, that it alone removes about 97 of the radioactivity in the cooling sytems, which eliminates the need to use separate oxidizing and decontaminating solutions. We have also found that the solution can remove radioactivity from the deposits of spent steam generators to such a great extent that it is no longer necessary to store the spent generators in specially constructed radiation containment buildings instead, the spent generators can be safely stored outside with their openings welded shut. The principles of this invention can be applied to the cooling systems of any nuclear reactor, including pressurized water reactors, boiling water reactors, and.gas cooled nuclear reactors. If the entire reactor is to be decontaminated, the reactor is first shut down, which means reducing the temperature of the coolant in the reactor to from 70 to 2000F. A ceric acid and an inorganic acid are then added directly to the aqueous coolant. If a portion of the cooling system, such as the steam generator, is to be decontaminated, the portion of the cooling system is drained and an aqueous solution is made up which is then circulated through that portion of the cooling system. The ceric acid solution of this invention is an aqueous solution of one or more of three ceric acids and an inorganic acid that complexes with the ceric acid. The ceric acid used in this solution may be tetra sulfato ceric acid H4Ce S04 4, commonly called ceric sulphate , hexasulfamato ceric acid H2Ce SO3NH2 6, commonly called ceric sulfamate , hexaperchlorato ceric acid H2Ce C104 6, commonly called ceric perchlorate , or a mixture thereof. Of the three ceric acids the tetra sulfato ceric acid is preferred as it is less corrosive.Use of the hexaperchlorato ceric acid is limited to the disposal of spent cooling system equipment due to the presence of chlorine in the acid. Subsequently, this can produce chloride which can stress corrosion cracking of stainless steels. Any inorganic acid or mixture of inorganic acids that will form a complex with the ceric acid in the solution may be used. The acid must be inorganic because the ceric acid will oxidize organic acids, wasting the ceric acid and adding to the quantity of waste products that must be handled. Inorganic acids which do not form a complex with the ceric acid are not suitable because the uncomr plexed compounds are not very reactive. Preferably, the inorganic acids used snould correspond to the ceric acids which are in the solution. For example, sulfuric acid would be used if the ceric acid was tetrasulfato ceric acid, sulfamic acid would be used if the ceric acid was hexasulfamato ceric acid, and perchloric acid would be used if the ceric acid was hexaperchlorato ceric acid.This results in a more readily formed complex and means that fewer different ions must be monitored and dealt with in the waste disposal of the solution. While use of the corresponding acids is preferred, other inorganic acids which form complexes with the ceric acid, such as nitric acid, can also be used. We have found that a complex does not form unless a minimum amount of the inorganic acid and the ceric acid are present. Thus, the concentrations of the ceric acid and the inorganic acid in the solution are to be regarded as critical to the effectiveness of the solutions in decontaminating metal surfaces in the cooling system. The concentration of the ceric acid in the solution should be from 0.5 to 3 3 all percentages herein are by weight based on the solution weight . Less than 0.5 of the ceric acid has virtually no effect on decontamination and more than 3 of the ceric acid is unnecessary and adds to the waste volume without producing additional decontamination. Also, more will require that more inorganic acid be present, which will result in more corrosion of the metal surfaces in the cooling system.The concentration of the inorganic acid in the solution is from 1 to 5 . If less than 1 is used, there is virtually no effect in decontaminating the metal surfaces, even when the concentration of the ceric acid is greater. More than 5 of the inorganic acid is too corrosive to the metal surfaces and unnecessarily adds to the waste volume. The temperature of the solution should be from 70 to 2000C. We have found that at lower temperatures, such as room temperature i.e., 20 to 25 OC . virtually no decontamination occurs. At temperatures above 2000C, however, the solution is too corrosive to metal surfaces. The ceric acid solution is circulated through the cooling system until the radioactivity level in the solution stabilizes. That is, the solution is circulated until the radioactivity of the solution leaving the cooling system is not substantially greater than the radioactivity of the solution entering the cooling system. The cooling system is then drained and rinsed, preferably with de ionized water at from 70 to 2000C. While the ceric acid solution by itself removes about 97 of the radioactivity, removal of some of the additional remaining radioactivity can be accomplished by using a conventional decontamination solution after using the ceric acid solution. A conventional decontamination solution is a mixture of a chelate such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or nitrilotriacetic acid with an organic acid such as citric or oxalic acid. The conventional decontamination solution is circulated at 70 to 2O00C between the cooling system and a cation exchange column until the radioactivity of the solution leaving the cooling system is not substantially greater than the radioactivity of the solution entering the cooling system.The cooling system is then rinsed with deionized water and its decontamination is complete. The spent cerium acid solution can be cleaned using a mixed anion cation exchange resin or it can be neutralized with hydroxide and evaporated and disposed of as solid waste. The spent decontamination solution can be cleaned with an anion exchange resin or a mixed exchange resin. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples Example 1 Samples of tubes from the steam generator of a pressurized water nuclear reactor about 1 inches long and 3 4 inches in diameter were cut in half longitudinally.The samples were placed in beakers containing various decontamination solutions except in some experiments the solutions were circulated over the samples in the beakers .After each sample was treated with a decontamination solution, the decontamination factor was determined. The decontamination factor DF is the radioactivity in microcuries before treatment divided by the radioactivity in microcuries after treatment. The following table gives the sequence of treatment of eleven different samples treated with various decontamination solutions for differ ent times and temperatures.In the table, CML is a commercial decontaminating solution believed to be 30 citric acid, 30 oxalic acid, 40 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and containing an inhibitor believed to be thiourea. CAS is ceric ammonium sulphate, CAN is ceric ammonium nitrate, and TSCA is tetrasulfato ceric acid.
