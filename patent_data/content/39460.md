The voltage comparator 5 compares a reference voltage Vr2 corresponding to a predetermined. temperature which is assumed to be 350 in the follo wing description substantially equal to the temperau re of an examinee and the temperature signal from the transformation circuit 2 and yields an output 1 while the temperature signal is higher than the reference voltage Vr2.The change over control circuit 6 controls the voltage control circuit 7 and the indicator II in accordance with the signals from the voltage comparators 4 and 5.The operation of the circuit 6 is as follows In the cases where the outputs from the voltage comparators 4 and 5 are both 0 and where the output from the voltage comparator 5 is 1 , the circuit 6 produces an output 0 , which is applied to the voltage control circuit 7 in the case where the outputs from the voltage comparators 4 and 5 are nl and 0 , respectively, the circuit 6 yields an output I , which is provided to the voltage control circuit 7 and, at the moment of the signal from the voltage comparator 5 becoming 1 , the circuit 6 applies a control signal to the indicator 11 to activate it. The circuit for such operations can easily be constituted using a flip flop or the like.The voltage control circuit 7 is designed so that when the output from the change over control circuit 6 is it , it supplies the transformation circuit 2 with a voltage Vh which applies a current of about 2 mA to the thermistor 1 to put it in the self heating state and that when the output from the change over control circuit 6 is 0 and when the power source switch 9 is turned ON namely, in the initial state , it supplies the transformation circuit 2 with a voltage W which provides to the thermistor 1 a current t of approxima tely 501us, for instance which does not make it selfheating.Figs. 2A and 2B are explanatory of the operation of the embodiment depicted in Fig. 1, Fig. 2A showing the temperature of the thermistor I and Fig. 2B the voltage which is applied to the transformation circuit 2. The broken line in Fig. 2A indicates the temperature of a thermistor in the prior art electronic clinical thermometer.Turning ON the power source switch 9 at a moment tl, the voltage Vt is applied to the transformation circuit 2, as depicted in Fig. 2B. Since the voltage VQ does not put the thermistor I in its self heating state as mentioned preciously, the thermistor 1 is held equal to room temperature until a moment t2 when to start taking the bodily temperature. Accordingly, the transformation circuit 2 provides the temperature sig nal corresponding to room temperature, which signal is applied to the differentiation circuit 3 and the voltage comparator 5, and also to the indicator II via the amplifier 10.Since the temperature signal provided in this while is substantially constant, the output from the differentiation circuit 3 is zero or very small and its level is lower than that of the reference voltage Vrl applied to the voltage comparator 4. In consequence, the output from the voltage comparator 4 is O in the time interval between the moments tl and t2.Assuming that the temperature of the thermistor 1, that is, room temperature is lower than 350C as shown in Fig. 2A, the output from the voltage comparator 5 is on. Consequently, the output from the change over control circuit 6 to the voltage control circuit 7 also becomes on, resulting in the voltage control circuit 7 providing the voltage VQ to the transformation circuit 2 in the time interval between the moments t1 and t2.Next, upon starting to measure the bodily temperature at the moment t2, the thermistor 1 is warmed by the body heat of the examinee to cause an increase in the temperature signal which is provided from the trans formation circuit 2. This raises the output from the differentiation circuit 3 higher than the reference voltage Vr1 being applied to the voltage comparator 4 so that its output becomes 1ns causing the output from the change over control circuit 6 to the voltage control circuit 7 to become 1 . Since the voltage control circuit 7 applies to the transformation circuit 2 such a voltage Vh that the thermistor I becomes self heating when the output from the change over control circuit 6 becomes 1 n, as described previously, the temperature of the thermistor 1 sharply rises, as depicted in Fig.2A, by which the temperature signal from the transformation circuit 2 is also abruptly increased. The voltage comparator 5 compares the temperature signal from the transformation circuit 2 and the reference voltage i. Vr2 and when the former becomes higher than the latter, that is, when the temperature of the thermistor 1 rises above 350C, the comparator 5 yields and provides the output I to the change over control circuit 6. As a result of this, the change over control circuit 6 applies a control signal to the indicator 11 to cause it to start its indicating operation and, at the same time, alters the output to the voltage control circuit 7 to 0 .When the output from the change over control circuit 6 becomes 0 5 the voltage control circuit 7.switches the voltage to the transformation circuit 2 from Th to VA , as shown in Fig. 2B, stopping the self heating of the thermistor 1. Consequently, after the moment t3 of stopping the thermistor 1 from self heating, a tempera ture signal corresponding to the temperature of the thermistor 1 warmed by the bodily temperature is outputted from the transformation circuit 2 and this temperature signal is provided via the amplifier 10 to the indicator 11 to indicate thereon the bodily temperatureAs described above, in this embodiment, the low voltage V is applied to the transformation ciuuit 2 in the time interval from the moment of turning QN of the power switch 9 to the moment of starting the measurement of the bodily temperature and the indicator 11 is activated after the temperature of the thermistor 1 becomes higher than 350C therefore this embodiment has the advantage of no waste of power dissipation. As shown in Fig. 2A, the time required for obtaining an accurate bodily temperature after starting the measurement was 23 sec. in the case of the electronic clinical thermometer of this embodiment and 65 sec. in the case of a conventional electronic clinical thermometer of the type that the thermistor is not self heated.Fig. 3 illustrates in block form another embodiment of the present invention. Reference numeral 12 indicates a pulse generator 13 designates a voltage control circuit AND identifies an AND gate OR denotes an OR gate and IN1 and IN2 represent inhibit gates.The other reference numerals corresponding to those in Fig. 1 indicate the same parts. The pulse generator 12 is to generate pulses of small pulse width at fixed intervals while the output from the AND gateAND is 1 . The voltage control circuit 13 is to apply to the transformation circuit 2 the voltage Vh which puts the thermistor 1 in its self heating state or the voltage VA which does not put the thermistor 1 in such a state, depending on whether the output from the OR gate OR is 1 or On, Figs. 4A and 4B are explanatory of the operation of the embodiment depicted in Fig. 3, Fig. 4A showing the temperature of the thermistor 1 and Fig. 4B the voltage which is supplied to the transformation circuit 2.Turning ON the power source switch 9 at the moment tl, the transformation circuit 2 is supplied with the voltage VQ which does not cause the thermistor 1 to become self heating, by which, as shown in Fig.43, the transformation circuit 2 yields the temperature signal corresponding to room temperature signal corresponding to room temperature until the moment t2 when measurement of the bodily temperature is started, the temperature signal being provided to the differentiation circuit 3 and the voltage comparator 5, and also to the indicator II via the amplifier 10, as described previously in conjunction with the foregoing embodiment.The output derived from the differentiation circuit 3 in this time interval between the moments tl and t2 is substantially zero and lower than the reference voltageVrl, as mentioned previously, so that the output from the voltage comparator 5 is O , assuming that the temperature of the thermistor 1, that is, room temperature is lower than 350C, as depicted in Fig. 4A.Accordingly, the outputs from inhibit gates INI andIN2 and the AND gate AND are all on. Since the pulse generator 12 produces pulses of small width at regular intervals only while the output from the AND gate AND is nl , as referred to previously, the output from the pulse generator 12 is 0 in the time interval from the moment t1 to t2. Consequently, in the time interval between the moments tl and t2, the output from theOR gate OR is on, so that the voltage control circuit 13 supplies the transformation circuit 2 with the voltage VL which does not make the thermistor 1 selfheating. Upon starting the measurement of the bodily temperature at the moment t2, the thermistor 1 is warmed buy the body heat of the examinee to increase the temperature signal from the transformation circuit 2, by which the output from the differentiation circuit 3 is raised higher than the reference voltage Vr1 being applied to the voltage comparator 4 and the output therefrom becomes 1 . The output from the voltage comparator 5 is held at On until the moment t3 when the temperature of the thermistor I reaches 350C, assuming that the reference voltage Vr2 corresponds to 350C as in the foregoing embodiment.Accordingly, in the time interval from the moment t2 to t3, the outputs from the AND gate AND and the inhibit gate IN2 are both O and the output from the inhibit gate IN1 is 1 . By the output 1 from the inhibit gate INI, the output from the OR gate OR is altered to 1 , by which the voltage control circuit 13 is caused to apply the voltage Vh to the transformation circuit 2, making the thermistor 1 selfheating. As a result of this, the temperature of the thermistor 1 abruptly rises, as depicted in Fig.4A, and consequently the temperature signal from the transformation circuit 2 also rapidly increases.When the level of the temperature signal reaches, at t the moment t3, the reference voltage Vr2 of the voltage comparator 5 corresponding to 35 0C, the voltage comparator 5 yields the output 1 to inhibit the inhibit gate IN1. At this time, if the output from the voltage comparator 4 is 1 , that is, if the ratio of increase of the temperature signal is higher than a fixed value even after the temperature of the thermistor 1 has reached 350C, the AND gate AND produces the output nln to activate the pulse generator 12. And if the output from the voltage comparator 4 is 0 , the inhibit gate IN2 provides the output 1 to start the operation of the indicator 11. Accordingly, even if the temperature of the thermistor 1 exceeds 350C, when the ratio of increase of the temperature signal is higher than the fixed value, the pulse generator 12 applies pulses of small pulse width to the voltage control circuit 13 via the OR gate OR at regular intervals and, as shown in Fig.43, the voltage control circuit 13, while being supplied with the pulses, provides the voltage Vh to the transformation circuit 2 to put the thermistor 1 in its self heating state, thereby making the temperature of the thermistor 1 quickly approach the temperature of the examinee. As the temperature of the thermistor 1 approaches the bodily temperature, the ratio of increase of the temperature signal which is provided from the transformation circuit 2 in the time interval between the pulses gradually decreases.When the ratio of increase becomes lower than a certain value, the voltage comparator 4 yields the output 0 to make the output from the AND gate AND by which the pulse generator 12 is stopped from operation. Consequently, after the moment t4 of stopping the operation of the pulse generator 12, the transformation circuit 2 provides the temperature signal corresponding to the temperature of the thermistor I warmed by the body heat of the examinee.The temperature signal is applied via the amplifier 10 to the indicator 11 for indication thereon.As described above, in this embodiment, even if the temperature of the thermistor 1 exceeds 350C, when the ratio of increase of the temperature signal is higher than a certain value, the voltage Vh which makes the thermistor I self heating is applied pulsewise to the transformation circuit 2 therefore, even if the bodily temperature is as high as, for example, 39 to 400C, time can be taken in a short time compared to the case of the embodiment depicted in Fig .1. The time for obtaining an accurate body temperature was 16 sec. after starting the measurement.As has been described in the foregoing, the electronic clinical thermometer of the present invention is provided with first detecting means which is formed by the differentiation circuit 3 and the voltage com parator 4 and detects whether or not the ratio of increase of the temperature signal from a bridge circuit constituted by the thermistor 1 and the transformation circuit 2 is higher than a certain value second detecting means which is formed by the voltage comparator 5 and the detects from the temperature signal whether or not the temperature of the thermistor 1 is higher than a predetermined value substantially equal to the temperature of the examinee and voltage control means which is formed by the change over control circuit 6 and the voltage control circuit 7 and supplies the bridge circuit with such a voltage that makes the thermistor 1 self heating only when the temperature of the thermistor 1 is lower than the predetermined value substantially equal to the body temperature and the ratio of increase of the temperature signal its higher than the certain value. Accordingly, a low voltage is applied to the bridge circuit until the start of measuring the bodily temperature after turningON the power source switch and, upon starting the measurement, the thermistor 1 can be made self heating so that its temperature reaches the predetermined value substantially equal to the bodily temperature.Therefore, the present invention has the advantage that one s temperature can accurately be taken in a short time and with small power consumption.Further, the electronic clinical thermometer of the present invention is provided with pulse generating means which is formed by the AND gate AND and the pulse generator 12 for generating pulses when the ratio of increase of the temperature signal is higher than a predetermined value even if the temperature of the thermistor 1 reaches the predetermined value substantially equal to the bodily temperature and voltage control means which, when the pulse generating means yields the pulses, applies the transformation circuit 2 with such a voltage that makes the thermistor 1 self heating. Therefore, even if the bodily temperature is appreciably higher than the aforementioned predetermined temperature, the thermistor 1 can be self heated, in a short time, up to the temperature substantially equal to the bodily temperature. Accordingly, even if the bodily temperature is as high as, for example, 390C to 400C, the bodily temperature can be measured in a short time.It will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of this invention.
