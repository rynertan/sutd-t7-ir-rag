# A method of fabricating and testing a programmable integrated circuit before it is programmed.

## Abstract
A method of testing normally untestable, programmable integrated circuits 10 before they are irreversibly program med by providing the circuit with first 25 28 and second impedances which combine to form an initial resultant impedance. The second of these impedances has a signifi cantly higher level of impedance then does the first. The first of these impedances 25 28 is required for testing purposes only and must be subsequently effectively removed from the circuit once testing of the circuit is completed. Once the circuit has been tested the second or higher impedance is made to interact with the circuit and functionally eliminate the first impedance from the circuit. The resultant impedance of the circuit after the first impedance has been functionally removed from the circuit can be either higher or lower than the pre programmed initial resultant impedance of the circuit.
