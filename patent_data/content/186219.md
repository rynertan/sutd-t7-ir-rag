# Control system for aircraft wheel brakes and method.

## Abstract
The invention provides a system and method for making the braking action more sensitive to pilot control, to provide a smooth stopping response to foot pedal movement by the pilot. A port control member 48 of a first stage metering valve 44 is mechanically connected to a pilot operated foot pedal 50 . A pilot applied force on the foot pedal 50 moves the member 48 in a direction causing flow through the valve 44 from a supply pressure to a control pressure chamber in a second stage metering valve 46 to produce a force on a second port control member 76 , for moving it in response to foot pedal 50 movement, to meter flow and pressure through the second stage metering valve 46 , from a supply pressure to the brake applying device of an aircraft wheel. The output pressure of the first stage metering valve is used as a feedback pressure to move the first stage port control member 48 into a null position in oppostion to the foot pedal force. Very little fluid flow through first stage valve 44 is required in order to develop the feedback force. The response to pilot movement of the foot pedal 50 is therefore almost instantaneous.
