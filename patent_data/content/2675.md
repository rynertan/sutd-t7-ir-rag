# Preparation of salt free N acyl taurines.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a substantially saltfree N acyl taurine by reacting 1 mode of a higher molecular weight carboxylic acid chloride with 1 mole of a taurine salt containing at least 1 N bonded H atom in a lower alkanol initially containing no more than about 15 by weight of water and about 1 mole of an alkali metal hydroxide at elevated temperatures, preferably at reflux, separating the insoluble precipitated alkali metal chloride from the alkanolic reaction medium at a temperature high enough to solubilize the N acyl taurine reaction product, and cooling the reaction medium low enough to precipitate the desired N acyl taurine.
