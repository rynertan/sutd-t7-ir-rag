# Apparatus and method for detecting cavities.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting interproximal cavities and the like. A high intensity light from an incandescent lamp is transmitted through an optical fiber bundle and is projected onto a tooth. Light passing around or through said tooth is detected by a second optical fiber bundle and is transmitted to a viewer it is projected through a lense system onto an opaque screen where an image of the tooth can be viewed and any defects therein can be detected.
