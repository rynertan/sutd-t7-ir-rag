# A nap raised fabric and a method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
A fabric with a distinctive handle consists of a nap raised fabric made from synthetic fibres where the percentage of void in the fabric structure is more than 80 percent and the fluff on the surface is composed of synthetic fibre staples of 0.4 to 1.4 denier made from poyester and or polyamide. The fabric may be made by weaving a fabric using warp yarns consisting of a blend of synthetic fibres made from polyester and or polyamide and fibres which are readily soluble and which have crimps, and using for the weft either spun yarns which consist wholly of synthetic fibres made from polyester and or polyamide of 0.4 to 1.4 denier or spun yarns consisting of a blend of at least 70 percent by weight of such synthetic fibres with fibres which are readily soluble and which have crimps. The fabric is then nap raised and subsequently the readily soluble fibres having crimps are entirely, or almost entirely, removed by dissolution. The new fabric, although being constituted wholly or almost wholly of synthetic fibres has a handle like that of high class natural wool fabrics and can be equal to that of cashmere and vicuna.
