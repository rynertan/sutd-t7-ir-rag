# Product recovery method for an aromatic hydrocarbon alkylation process.

## Abstract
A fractionation method is disclosed for the recovery of product alkylaromatic hydrocarbons produced by the alkyla tion of aromatic hydrocarbons. Three fractionation columns are employed in series. Aromatic feed hydrocarbons are recy cled from the overhead of the first column, which is reboiled by the overhead vapor of the second column. The product alkylaromatic is recovered from the condensate produced in using the second column overhead as a heat source. The product alkylaromatic is also present in the bottoms of the second column which flows into a low pressure stripping column. The entire overhead vapor of the stripping column is compressed and passed into the lower portion of the second column.
