## Description
Early detection of malignant neoplastic tissue is absolutely critical for successful treatment of many types of cancer. Various methods have been used to detect neoplastic tissue, but to date non invasive methods of detecting such tissue have shown only limited usefulness. Many attempts have centered around discovering imaging agents which localize in neoplastic tissue. There are materials such as certain porphyrins which do localize in neoplastic tissue. The porphyrins are complex tetrapyrrole compounds normally found in plants and animals. Many of these porphyrins fluoresce when exposed to an appropriate light source. One particular porphyrin preparation which selectively localizes in neoplastic tissue is hematoporphyrin derivative HPD prepared by treating hematoporphyrin with concentrated sulfuric acid, resulting in a crude mixture of several porphyrins. Lipson et al J. Natl. Cancer Institute. Although HPD and DHE localize in neoplastic tissue and can be detected by photodynamic methods, the usefulness of these compounds is limited. This is primarily due to the fact that these photodynamic methods require invasive procedures. The HPD and DHE must be activated HPD has been radio labeled in an attempt to eliminate the major problems encountered by the photodynamic technique. Nuclear scintillation imaging procedures employing radio pharmaceuticals are simple and not invasive. Following parenteral administration of the radio labeled HPD, the radiopharmaceutical concentrates in the tumors to be detected and is imaged using appropriate nuclear medicine imaging devices. Past attempts have met with only limited success. Protoporphyrin and hematoporphyrin labeled with ⁶⁴Cu were shown to concentrate in mouse tumors In accordance with one aspect of the invention a radio labeled compound has the following general formula In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of imaging neoplastic tissue of mammals comprises parentarelly applying to a mammal an effective amount of a compound having the following general formula In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a method of treating neoplastic tissue in a mammal comprises parentarally applying to a mammal an effective amount of a compound having the following general formula The present invention is premised upon the realization that the following compound These radiolabeled DHE compounds, when injected into a mammal, provide a means to detect neoplastic tissue. Further, when the radio labeled compound has an adequate component of particulate radiation, such as a labeled compound wherein the radionuclide is iodine 131 a strong beta emitter , then the compound can be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of neoplastic tissue. The DHE localizes in the neoplastic tissue and the radiation emitted by these particular radio pharmaceuticals will act to destroy or reduce the mass of neoplastic tissue. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the following Dihematoporphyrin ether DHE is one of several components contained in hematoporphyrin derivative HPD . Hematoporphyrin derivative HPD is prepared by the method of Lipson Lipson, R.L., et al J.Nat Cancer Instl. Dihematoporphyrin ether DHE is separated from the HPD solution by liquid chromotography, gel filtration or electrophoretic methods. If P 10 gel filtration is used the DHE can be recovered in the void volume. As described in Porphyrins in Phototherapy ed. A. Andrium R. Cybeddu, Plenum Publishing Corp. New York , 1984 pp.23 35, DHE can be separated from HPD by gel filtration using a Bio Gel P 10, 100 200 mesh packed column. Bio Rad., Richmond, California . HPD is eluted with distilled water ph 7 8 . DHE was eluted at the exclusion limit of the column. DHE is also supplied by Johnson Johnson under the name Photoprin II. Radiolabeled DHE according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention has the following general formula wherein R₁ R₄ represent a carboxylic acid group COOH or C₁ C₁₀ alkyl ester derivative thereof, and wherein R₅ and R₆ can represent hydroxyl OH or the radiolabeled reaction product of a cyclic anhydride such as succinic anhydride with the hydroxyl group. This would form mono or di succinyl DHE having a carboxylic acid group which in turn can react with a radiolabeled amine or alcohol. At least one of R₁ R₆ is a moiety labeled with a radionuclide. Preferred radio labeled amide groups include amide groups substituted with ¹²³I, ¹²⁵I, ¹³¹I, ¹³²I, ¹³³I, ¹³⁵I, ⁷⁷Br or ⁸²Br. Preferably at least one of R₁ R₄ and more preferably three of the R₁ R₄ groups represent Co₂H. Preferably R₅ and R₆ represents hydroxyl group. The preferred radio labeled compound is one where one of R₁ R₄ represents radio halogenated histamine or tyrosine. According to a first method, radiolabeled DHE is prepared by reacting a radiolabeled compound or precursor with DHE under suitable reaction conditions. Preferably, the radiolabeled precursor will be a radiolabeled amine or radiolabeled alcohol which can form an amide or an ester with the DHE. Suitable radiolabeled amines would include imidazol substituted alkyl amines, phenol substituted alkyl amines, sulfide substituted alkyle amines. Suitable alcohols would include imidazol substituted alkyl alcohols, phenol substituted alkyl alcohols and sulfide substituted alkyl alcohols. For example the following precursors should be suitable for use in radio labeling DHE Preparation of radiolabeled precursors is well known. For example the method of radio halogenation is reported by Greenwood F. C., Hunter W. M., Glover, J. S., Conjugation of one of the amine radiolabeled precursors with DHE to form radiolabeled DHE is carried out in an aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution in the presence of carbodiimide reagent for amide formation. Isolation and purification of the conjugated products is achieved by selective precipitation and gel filtration ion exchange chromotography. Biogel P 10 is a suitable medium for gel filtration chromotography in which the aggregate of radio labeled DHE conjugates in an aqueous medium can be excluded completely from the gel while lower molecular weight radio labeling compounds such as histamine or tyrosine can be retained on the column. Esterification of one of the alcohol precursors can be conducted by simple raction of the alcohol with DHE in the presence of a mineral acid. Due to steric hinderance, this reaction may proceed at a relatively slow rate. Accordingly, labeling by formation of the amide is preferred. The precursor compounds, both amines and alcohols, can also be bonded to either of the two hydroxyl groups. However, to facilitate this reaction the hydroxyl group must first be reacted with a cyclic anhydride or a diacid. The anhydride or acid react under acid pH is an aqueous medium to form an ester with a free carboxylic acid functionality. In turn, this carboxylic acid functionality can react with the amine or hydroxyl group of the precursor to form an amide or ester, respectively. Thus R₅ and R₆ can represent The radio labeled DHE can be used for diagnostic purposes by injecting an effective amount of the radiolabeled compound and observing localization of the compound using radio scintillation methods after about 30 minutes to 72 hours preferably about 24 hours to allow the DHE to clear the blood. The methods of imaging using nuclear medicine imaging techniques are well known and can be conducted, for example, using a gamma camera which detects gamma radiation emitted by the radionuclide. Positron detectors can also be used with ⁷⁷Br. The administered activity will vary depending on the subject. Examples provide dose information for smaller mammals. For use in, for example, a 70 kilo human the dose range will vary from about 25 microcuries to about 2 millicuries depending on the purpose of the examination. The labeled DHE is applied perenterally and preferably intravascularly. The labeled DHE can be carried in any therapeutically acceptable carrier or vehicle such as saline. For therapeutic uses the radio labeled DHE must have a strong component of particulate radiation, for example, a strong beta emitter. Accordingly, the radio emitting compound must be ¹²⁵I, ¹³¹I, ¹³²I, ¹³³I, ¹³⁵I, ⁸²Br. For therapeutic applications the administered activity should be, for example, from about 500 microcuries to about 200 millicuries for a 70 kilo adult applied intravascularly. The administered activity will of course vary depending on the stage of the cancer, the age and health of the subject, and radiation dose response considerations. The invention will now be further described with reference to the following examples. Histamine 0.4 mg in 100 microliters of aqueous phosphate buffer was added to an iodegen plated 4 micrograms polypropylene test tube together with 10 microliters of Na¹³¹I 20 millicuries . This was left at room temperature for thirty minutes. This produced an aqueous solution of 131 Iodohistamine, which can be used directly in the conjugation reaction with DHE described in Example II. DHE 8.5 micromoles was radiolabeled by coupling at least one of the four carboxylic acid groups with ¹²⁵I iodohistamine 2.13 micromoles in 90 tetrahydrofuran THF in the presence of triethylamine 2.13 micromoles and 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride 2.13 micromole at room temperture overnight. The solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen and the residue dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 M NH₄OH. DHE was precipitated by adjusting the pH to 4 with acetic acid, washed with 0.1 M acetic acid three times and redissolved in 0.1 M NH₄OH. ¹²⁵I histamine DHE ¹²⁵I hDHE and unlabeled DHE were separated by an anion exchange column AG1X8 by eluting the column with 20 THF, 50 THF, 90 THF, 0.1 M acetic acid and 90 THF and 0.1 M HCL and 90 THF. ¹²⁵I hDHE was eluted in the acetic acid THF fraction. Photosensitizing activity of ¹²⁵I hDHE was confirmed by its ability to lyse red blood cells following laser radiation. Its tumor localizing ability was assessed in spontaneous memory tumor fast SMT F bearing DBA 2HA mice. The following specific tumor to tissue ratio counts per minute per gram were obtained 24 hours after intraperataneal injection brain 64.27 , muscle 6.07 , blood 3.32 , lung 1.54 , kidney 2.54 , spleen 0.48 , liver 0.15 . Such ratios are similar to those obtained with ³H and ¹⁴C labeled HDP suggesting that biological distribution of the radiated compound is not altered by labeling procedure. ¹³¹I hDHE was used to image tumor bearing mice. The mice were injected with 65 microcuries of ¹³¹I hDHE 20 micrograms of ¹³¹I hDHE per gram of mouse weight . After 24 hours nuclear scintillation images were obtained. The ¹³¹I hDHE localized in tumors and an image of the tumors was obtained. Thus by labeling DHE at one of the four carboxylic acid sites or hydroxyl sites, the compound will still localize in neoplastic tissues. This in turn provides a means to identify and image neoplastic tissue and to chemotherapeutically treat malignant neoplastic tissue.
