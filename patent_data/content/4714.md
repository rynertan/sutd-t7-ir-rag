# Resinous polymeric substances, their preparation from a carbonyl compound and an amine or ammonia and their use in froth flotation.

## Abstract
A resinous polymeric substance for use as an aid in froth flotation characterized by its mean molecular weight, elemental analysis, viscosity and infra red spectrum. A method of making the substance by reacting a carbonyl compound with an amine or ammonia followed by heating and a method of froth flotation in which the substance is used as an aid. The substance has a mean molecular weight in the range 250 10 000 it includes carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen it has a viscosity of 10 000 to 100 000 centipoise at 20 C and 100 to 1 000 centipoise at 70 C and it has an infra red spectrum including bands characteristic of the groups C N , N H and C C .
