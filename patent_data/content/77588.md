## Description
IMPROVED MACIE DISHWASHING AND RINSING COMPOSITIONThe present invention relates to an improvement in machine dishwashing and rinsing compositions.In machine diswashing processes usually two products are applied, i.e. a machine dishwashing composition for use in the main wash cycle, and a rinse aid composition for use in the rinse cycle. Both products usually contain an active detergent material. Since both products are applied to the articles to be cleaned or rinsed by spraying the wash or rinse liquor containing these products thereon, which implies the use of a pump, the generation of too much foam thereby is a serious problem.Too much foam can cause too much noise, may damage the heating coil of the dishwashing machine, can lead to the pump malfunctioning and may impair the overall efficacy of the dishwashing process. Consequently, only lowfoaming active detergent materials are commonly used in machine dishwashing and rinsing compositions.Nevertheless, still too much foam can be generated, e.g.by the soil removed from the articles to be cleaned, if no additional measures, such as the use of foam depressing agents are taken. This foam formation can cause the pressure of the pump with which the wash liquor or the rinse water is sprayed upon the articles to be cleaned to drop, which produces the above mentioned disadvantages.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide for a machine dishwashing or rinse composition which, when in use in a dishwashing or rinsing operation, prevents the pump pressure from dropping to any significant degree.It has now been found that this object can be achieved by the inclusion in a machine dishwashing or rinsing composition of a small, effective amount of a special group of polymers. The machine dishwashing or rinsing composition, in which the special group of polymers is included , is of the usual type and formulation, containing as active detergent material a nonionic detergent, preferably a low foaming one.In its broadest aspect therefore, the invention relates to a machine dishwashing or rinsing composition comprising a nonionic detergent, and is characterized by the inclusion therein of a small, effective amount of a special group of polymers.The special group of polymers consists of polyelectrolytes which contain cationic charges, either permanent or at the pH of usage. They have a cationic charge to carbon atom in the backbone ratio of from 0.03 to 0.5. They may contain additional neutral or anionic groups, with an anionic to cationic group ratio of as high as 3 1. They have a molecular weight in the range of 5.103 to 5.105.The special group of polymers consists of three kinds of polymers, i.e. those based on quaternized diethylaminoethylmethacrylate, those based on dimethyldialkylammoniumhalide, and quaternized polysaccbarides. To the first class belongs as typical example a copolymer of N vinylpyrrolidone and quaternized diethylaminoethylmethacrylate, having a molecular weight of 105.To the second class belong as typical examples poly dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride having a molecular weight of 105, and poly dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride acryl amide having a molecular weight of 2.5 x 105 to 5 x 105 and having a molar percentage ratio of dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride to acrylamide ranging from 20 80 to 80 20. To this second class also belongs 1,5 dimethyl 1,5 diazaundecamethylene polymetho bromide, having a molecular weight of 5.103 104.To the third class belong 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride ethers of hydroxyethyl cellulose, having a molecular weight of 105 2.5 x 105.Typical, commercially available polymers belonging to the above classes are Gafquat 734 ex Gaf Corp. Merquat 550 ex Chemviron, Brussels, Belgium Polybrene ex AldrichChemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisc., USA Polymer JR 125 andPolymer JR 400 ex Union Carbide, etc.The polymers of the invention are used in the machine dishwashing or rinsing composition in an amount of 0.1 to 10 , preferably 0.2 to 1 by weight.The balance of the composition consists of the usual ingredients, present in machine dishwashing or rinsing compositions.Thus, the machine dishwashing composition usually comprises from 0.1 to 10 by weight of a nonionic detergent, preferably a low foaming one. This is a wellknown class of nonionic detergents, examples of which are amply described in the textbook Nonionic Surfactants bM. Schick. Furthermore, it comprises from 1 to 80 by weight of one or more builder salts, such as alkali metal ortho , pyro , tripoly , hexametaphosphates, alkali metal citrates, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal carboxy methyloxysuccinate, alkali metal nitrilotriacetate, zeolites and so on. In addition, it contains from 1 to 80 of an alkalimetal silicate, from 1 to 50 of an oxygen or chlorine bleaching agent, and it may further contain as optional ingredients perfumes, germicides, corrosion inhibitors, enzymes, bleach precursors, reducing agents, clays, and so on.Buffer salts, such as borates, can also be included.A rinse composition usually also comprises from 1 to 60 , preferably 10 35 by weight of a nonionic detergent, preferably a low foaming one, and furthermore optional ingredients, such as solvents, in organic acids, preservatives, perfumes, dyes, hydrotropes, enzymes, germicides, all in the usual amounts.It has been found in this respect that it is of specific advantage if the rinsing composition also contains a low level, i.e. 0.1 1 by weight of an anionic detergent.The benefits of the present invention are thereby significantly increased in a rinse composition. The anionic detergent can be any well known type, including fatty acid soaps. Typical examples are aikylaryl sulphonates, alkane sulphonates, olefin sulphonates, alkylsulphates, alkylethersulphates and so on.Preferred anionic detergents are the alkali metal salts of straight chain C10 C18 akylbenzene sulphonates, and alkali metal salts of C10 Cl8 alkylether sulphates, containing from 1 10 moles of alkylene oxide. Alkylether carboxylates are also suitable.The compositions of the present invention can be made in any suitable physical form, such as powders, granulates, tablets, liquids, etc. For machine dishwashing products the granular form is usually prepared, whereas the rinse composition is usually in liquid form. In the latter case, the various ingredients of the rinse composition can naturally also be added to the rinse water.The invention will further be illustrated by way ofExample. Examples A FIn the following Examples A F a normal washing procedure was carried out in a commercial domestic dishwashing machine. In the main wash 30 g of a current commercial dishwashing composition was used and at the start of the final rinse cycle 2 ml. of a liquid rinse aid of the following composition were added wt. C12 C18 alcohol condensed with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide Plurafac RA 30 described in US patent 3 340 309 10Citric acid 18Sodium xylene sulphonate 3Preservative 0.1Dye 0.006Water balanceThe tests were carried out with this rinse aid composition as well as with this composition to which either an anionic detergent, a polymer or both were added. The anionic detergent was sodiumdodecylbenzenesulpho te, and the polymer was Gafquat 734, a copolymer of N vLnyl pyrrolidone and quaternized diethylaminoethylmethacry late, having a molecular weight of 105.The number of rotations per minute of the lower spray arm of the dishwashing machine was counted at different temperatures. A decrease in the number indicates a drop in pump pressure if the number of rotations remains constant, the pump pressure remains constant.
