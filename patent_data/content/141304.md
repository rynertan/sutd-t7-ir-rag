## Description
SPECIFICATIONTITLE OF THE INVENTION Method for the Cell Fusion of Laver BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention This invention relates to a method for the cell fusion of laver by using monospores, carpospores or conchospores produced in the life cycle of laver.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART In recent years, extensive research and development concerning cell fusion as a genetic engineering technique have been being carried on and, with terrestrial plants, the stage of practical application has already been attained in some instances. With marine algae including red lavers , however, no successful case of cell fusion has been reported as yet. This situation arises from the fact that, with terrestrial plants, protoplasts can be readily formed by using a commercially available enzyme preparation e.g., Cellulase Onozuka, Pectolyase orMacerozyme , while with marine algae and especially with red lavers, the polysaccharides constituting the skeletal components of their tissue resist treatment with such an enzyme preparation and thereby hinder the formation of sound protoplasts. More specifically, the polysaccharides constituting the tissue of red lavers include xylan, mannan and porphyran. In particular, the cell wall consists of xylan formed into strong fibers and, therefore, cannot be hydrolyzed by an enzyme preparation as described above. Up to the present, there has been no report on an enzyme preparation having the ability to hydrolyze the aforesaid three polysaccharides at the same time. In view of the above described existing state of the art in which it is very difficult to prepare sound protoplasts by treating the tissue of laver with an enzyme, the present inventor has found that the cell fusion of laver can be achieved by paying attention to monospores, carpospores or conchospores produced in the life cycle of layer and applying conventional cell fusion techniques to those reproductive cells with the aid of a fusion inducing substance.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made on the basis of the above described finding and has enabled the cell fusion of laver without using protoplasts of laver. Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a method for the cell fusion of laver not by using protoplasts of laver, but by using reproductive cells selected from the group consisting of monospores, carpospores and conchospores produced in the life cycle of laver. Other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The characteristic feature of the present invention lies in the fact that monospores, carpospores or conchospores produced in the life cycle of laver are subjected to cell fusion with the aid of a fusion inducing substance. Monospores for use in the cell fusion method of the present invention are spores produced from thalli of laver in the life cycle thereof.They become attached to laver netting, germinate to produce a rhizoid and form a cell wall, and then grow by cell division to produce thalli of laver. In this life cycle, monospores in the stage preceding the formation of a cell wall are gelatinous, amoeboid cells having a diameter of the order of 10 13 microns.They are considered to be in substantially the same form as protoplasts obtained by removing the cell wall from thalli of laver. Carpospores are also spores produced from thalli of laver in the life cycle thereof. They part from the thalli of laver, become attached to shells or the like, and eventually penetrate thereinto to produce filaments known as the Conchocelis phase.They have a thin cell wall and, similarly to the aforesaid monospores, are considered to be in substantially the same form as protoplasts prepared from laver. Furthermore, conchospores for use in the cell fusion method of the present invention are spores produced from the Conchocelis phase of laver in the life cycle thereof. They become attached to laver netting, germinate to produce a rhizoid and form a cell wall, and then grow by cell division to produce thalli of laver. Conchospores in the stage preceding the formation of a cell wall are gelatinous, amoeboid cells having a diameter of the order of 10 13 microns.They are considered to be in substantially the same form as protoplasts obtained by removing the cell wall from thalli of laver. These reproductive cells can be artificially obtained as follows In the case of monospores, young thalli of Porphyra tenera having a size of 0.2 1.0 mm or thalli of Porphyra yezoensis having a size of 1.0 10 cm are cultured in artificial sea water until it is noted that cells are released from marginal portions of the thalli. At the stage where cells have been released from a large number of thalli, the culture medium containing them are centrifuged and the resulting residue is collected. In the case of carpospores, mature thalli of laver are placed in artificial sea water and cultured at a water temperature of 15 C under illumination at a light intensity of 1,500 lux with alternation of 12 hour light periods and 12 hour dark periods until they liberate carpospores.Then, the culture medium containing these carpospores is centrifuged and the resulting residue is separated. In order to obtain conchospores artificially, mature filaments of the Conchocelis phase are cultured in artificial sea water with forced aeration until they liberate conchospore in 3 4 days . Then, the culture medium containing these conchospores is centrifuged and the resulting residue is collected. In the practice of the present invention, suspensions are prepared by adding an appropriate amount of sterilized artificial sea water to each of the residues comprising monospores, carpospores or conchospores artificially obtained in the abovedescribed manner. Then, these suspensions are subjected to cell fusion according to the procedure given below.Procedure for Cell Fusion In the case of monospores or carpospores, a suspension prepared in the above described manner is dropped into a Petri dish or the like and allowed to stand until a sediment is formed on the glass surface. To this sediment is added a 54 polyethylene glycol solution as the fusion inducing substance. After standing for an adequate length of time, a high pH calcium solution 100 mM Cacti2, pH 10.5 is added thereto and allowed to stand at room temperature. Desirably, the addition of a high pH calcium solution is repeated twice. Then, the monospores or carpospores treated as above are cultured in a culture medium comprising artificial sea water. Thus, the formation of homokaryons from monospores or carpospores can be confirmed by observation under the microscope. In the case of conchospores, a conchospore suspension prepared in the above described manner is dropped onto a hole slide made of glass. Then, a fusion inducing substance comprising, for example, a 15 208 w w polyethylene glycol solution, highmolecular weight dextran in sulfuric acid, a highly concentrated sodium nitrate solution, a high pH high Ca solution 50 mM CaCl2, pH 10.5 or the like is added thereto and allowed to stand at room temperature for 40 50 minutes. Thus, the occurrence of cell membrane fusion as a result of the treatment with a fusion inducing substance such as polyethylene glycol can be confirmed by observation under the microscope. The occurrence of cell membrane fusion may be confirmed, for example, by reference to the schematic illustration of various stages of cell fusion which is given in Senda et al., Cell Fusion in Plants Cells, 12 8 , 1980 . It is to be understood that essentially no fusion of monospores, carpospores or conchospores is noted unless these reproductive cells are treated according to the above described procedure for cell fusion. When the homokaryons resulting from the above described cell fusion of monospores, carpospores or conchospores are cultured in sterilized artificial sea water, more than 90 of them produce a rhizoid to form a cell wall, grow by cell division, and eventually produce thalli of laver. As described above, the present invention enables the cell fusion of laver not by using protoplasts whose preparation is said to involve much difficulty, but by using monospores obtained by culturing young thalli of laver, carpospores obtained by culturing mature thalli of laver, or condhospores liberated from the Conchocelis phase of laver. In addition, the use of such monospores, carpospores or conchospores for the cell fusion of laver has the advantage of eliminating the necessity for a hypertonic solution as used in the cell fusion of protoplasts prepared from terrestrial plants. More specifically, according to reports on the cell fusion of terrestrial plants, it is generally recognized that protoplasts obtained by treatment with an enzyme such as cellulase will burst unless they are handled in a hypertonic solution. Thus, it is required to handle them in a hypertonic solution containing 0.4 0.7M mannitol or sorbitol. However, this means that, when the fused protoplasts are to be regenerated, they must be cultured in a hypertonic culture medium. The higher osmotic pressure of the outside of the protoplasts may cause damage to the cell membrane present at the surface of the protoplasts and diable them from growing in the normal state. On the contrary, monospores, carpospores and conchospores for use in the cell fusion method of the present invention will never burst of themselves even when cultured in a culture medium containing no mannitol or sorbitol, as may be understood from the fact that, under natural conditions, they are liberated from thalli of laver or theConchocelis phase thereof, float in the sea water and then become attached to laver netting. Thus, these reproductive cells are characterized in that their growth will never encounter the above described interference. To further illustrate the present invention, the following examples are given. However, these examples are not to be construed to limit the scope of the invention.Example 1Preparation of a Monospore Suspension Young thulli of Porphyra tenera having a size of 0.2 1.0 mm were placed in sterilized artificial sea water Asp 12 having the composition given below and cultured at a temperature of 180C under illumination at a light intensity of 4,000 lux with alternation of 8 hour light periods and 16 hour dark periods .At the stage where the liberation of monospores was noted, the culture medium was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the resulting residue was collected.
