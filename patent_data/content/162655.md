# Decorative trim strips and process for making the same.

## Abstract
A trim strip is provided for decorating an automobile door or the like. The trim strip is of generally rectangular shape and has a length longer than the width of the door that is to be decorated. The trim strip includes a foil member 12 whose upper surface is provided with a decorative pat tern. A partial section of the upper surface of the foil member bears a weather resistant and impact resistant plastic overlay 16 having radiused edges and providing a lens effect to the foil member. The plastic overlaid section of the foil member 12 is essentially coextensive with the width of the door to be decorated. When the trim strip is applied to the door, the uncoated ends of the foil member 12 are wrapped around the edges of the door 3 and bonded to the door s underside. No end of the trim strip is present on the door surface and thus subject to delamination. In addition, since the ends of the trim strip are wrapped around the door edges, the precise placement of the trim strip is not as critical as is the case with presently employed trim strips.
