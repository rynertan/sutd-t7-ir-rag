# Ultrasound System and method for directional detection of blood velocities.

## Abstract
The velocity and direction of the flow of blood and similar liquids, toward or away from the transducer, are measured by coherent demodulation of the received echoes in two quadra ture components and subsequent real time processing by a complex Fourier transform processor. A distribution of Dop pler frequency shifts and bidirectional velocities are detected and displayed. The preferred embodiment is a duplex imag ing system with a sector scanner 11,12,13,14,15 into which a Dopper modality is incorporated with little added complexity.
