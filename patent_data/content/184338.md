# Alloy production by vapour condensation.

## Abstract
In the production of alloy by evaporation from an evaporation bath and condensation under vacuum, charge replenishment is achieved by a procedure involving bleeding charge from the bath and admixing the bled charge with replenishment material and introducing replenishment from the admixture. An apparatus for use in the process compris es a mixing passageway encompassing an evaporation bath and distributed sub surface bleed ports and feed ports linking the evaporation bath and the mixing chamber. Flow of metal through the ports is induced by pumped circulation in the mixing chamber. The circulation is turbulent for good mixing of the metals.
