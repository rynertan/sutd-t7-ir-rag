# Integrated read only memory.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor integrated circuit read only memory a number of conductors 16â‚‚ , either word conductors or bit conductors, are foreshortened where permitted by the information stored in the memory. The space made available by this foreshortening is used, for example, by connection leads 45 to conductor 15
