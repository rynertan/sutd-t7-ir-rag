# Production of 1,2 dichloroethane.

## Abstract
Process for the production of 1,2 dichloroethane by the reaction between ethylene and chlorine in the vapour phase in the presence of a catalyst comprising alumina, wherein the reaction is carried out using a fluidised bed comprising fluidisable, substantially spherical particles of alumina of surface area not exceeding 10 m²g ¹ and especially in the range 0.2 to 6 m²g ¹.
