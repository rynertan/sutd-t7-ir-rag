## Description
INJECTION BLOW MOLDING OF PLASTIC GLOBES CRO5S REFERENCE This is a continuation in part of commonly owned application Serial No. 439,799, filed November 8, 1982, which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Heretofore it has been known to form glass globes for lighting fixtures. However, the cost of such globes coupled with the weight and likelihood of breakage of the same, has given way to a desirability of forming globes for lighting fixtures from plastics. The material for such plastic globes is typically cheaper, the overall weight is substantially less, and the likelihood of breakage is considerably less than the prior glass globes. As a point of fact, it has been desired to form globes of acrylics, such as polymethylmethacrylate. Other suitable materials are known to be polycarbonate, polyethylene, polystyrene and its copolymers and homopolymers, and butyrate. All of these plastics, in their pure form, are highly transparent, exceptionally strong, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive.However, the forming of spheres or globes of such materials having uniform wall thickness, high clarity, and absent surface blemishes has heretofore been extremely difficult to achieve on a production basis. To achieve this technique, albeit unsatisfactorily, the prior art has taught rotational molding wherein granular plastic material is placed in a mold, nutated in an oven, and subsequently cooled to a setting temperature. The resulting globes have lacked clarity and have been characterized by extensive surface blemishes for the particular reason that heating of the granular plastic makes the imperfections of such plastic apparent in the melted mass. The blow molding of hollow articles by the setting up of a heat softened material against the inner surface of a hollow mold has been practiced for a great many years with a wide variety of materials, including super cooled liquids such as glass which are solidified by chilling the molds, or heat reactive materials such as thermosetting polymers which are set up by heating the molds, or thermoplastic materials such as the commercial plastics which are usually set up by contact with molds at ambient temperatures. With all of these materials, several manipulative procedures may be used. In dip blow molding, one end of a suitable tube is dipped in a molten mass of material and the quantity of molten material picked up during withdrawal of the tube is expanded inside a hollow mold by partially introducing the dipped end of the tube into the mold and blowing air in from the other end of the tube. In extrusion blow molding, a thermosetting or thermoplastic material is first extruded into a tubular parison open at both ends which, while still in a soft and pliable condition, is placed at precise time intervals by generally complex machines between the two halves of a hollow mold such that when the mold is completely closed, one end of the tubular shape is pinched shut between the mold halves to retain air and the other end is held open at the other end of the hollow mold through which air is introduced under pressure into the parison to expand it radially to conform to the inner surface of the mold. In injection blow molding, a thermoplastic material is first injection molded into a cylindrical preform already closed at one end, which preform, while still in a hot and pliable condition, or after cooling and reheating to a soft and pliable condition, is held suspended inside a hollow mold such that the opening in the mold externally grasps the open end of the preform, through which compressed air is introduced into the preform to expand it both axially and radially to form against the inner surface of the mold. If radial uniformity is needed in a large blow molded plastic article, a fairly complex auxiliary mechanism is required in injection blow molding to keep the closed end of the preform centered during the axial and radial expansion occurring simultaneously.For example, a shaft may be introduced through the open end of the preform and engaged at the center of the inside of the closed end. However, in such a procedure, it is difficult to register the shaft dead center because of slipperiness of the preform and the shaft. Extrusion blow molding offers radial uniformity but at the cost of leaving behind in the final article a large and undesirable scar resulting from the parison pinch off. Dip blow molding, on the other hand, is used for making glass articles and is unsuitable for making plastic products. Hence, large hollow spheres or other radially symmetrical objects cannot be produced uniformly at all to high aesthetic standards, from impact resistant or other co mercial plastics, in any simple embodiment of the foregoing procedures. Prior art also includes U.S. Patent Nos. 3,202,739 3,294,883 3,761,550 3,865,912 4,044,086 3,801,690 4,026,984 4,049,767 and 3,719,735. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION I have invented a process which is especially adapted for molding large radially symmetrical plastic enclosures for lighting purposes because it not only produces the desired hollow shape but also, with the very simplest equipment and procedure, automatically provides radial uniformity in the wall of the enclosure at any given axial position, which is so desirable for uniform light transmission. By some simple additions or modifications to the equipment or procedure, the relative thickness of different parts of the hollow enclosure can be adjusted in an axial direction, while maintaining radial uniformity, to meet special requirements for different products or different types of service requirements of the same products. The equipment needed in the simplest form of the invention is only a divided hollow mold with a radially symmetrical cavity about its axis into which cavity protrudes axially a spring biased shaft capable of withdrawing out of the cavity upon urging and having a recess in its end inside the cavity, together with means for heating a plastic preform to make it uniformly soft and pliable and other means for expanding it with compressed air. A presently preferred material is a well known clear or transparently tinted acrylic such as polymethylmethacrylate having a high degree of light transmission capability. However, many other kinds of thermoplastic materials can be used, including polycaibonates, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polystyrenes, acetates, butyrates, ABS plastics, along with copolymers of some of the foregoing materials and also their blends with each other. Even thermoplastic elastomers may be used for products not required to be rigid. The only requirements are that the material be a thermoplastic that can initially be molded into a cylindrical preform which, after cooling to ambient temperatures and storage, can be later reheated to a soft and pliable condition with sufficient melt strength to enable its expansion by compressed air and subsequently set up on contact with the inner surface of a hollow mold maintained at ambient tempera tures. Neither the materials nor most of the equipment needed are critical to this invention nor essentially novel. Plastics molders have known suitable materials for blow molding lighting enclosures for many years, but have lacked procedures for fabricating large hollow products to high aesthetic standards in a simple and economical way. It is this lack which is supplied by the present invention. The new procedure of this invention consists of making from a thermoplastic material, by injection molding, an essentially cylindrical preform open at one end, closed at the opposite end and possessing a characteristic sprue nipple, which is usually removed after injection molding but, for the purpose of this process is intentionally retained in its position at the center of the closed end, which nipple is designed to be of sufficient dimensions and strength for centralizing the preform under lateral stresses typically experienced by it during simultaneous axial and radial expansion, cooling the said preform after it is made and reheating it before blow molding by first raising its entire mass to a temperature just below its softening point and then by further heating it in a suitable temperature gradient by rotating it perfectly concentrically around its longitudinal axis by registering the nipple in a recess at the end of a shaft located axially beyond the closed end of the preform, which shaft has a low heat conductivity, removing the heated preform when sufficiently soft and pliable, transferring it to a divided open mold such that the nipple registers in a recess at the end of a spring biased shaft protruding axially into the mold cavity, closing the mold completely so as to grasp externally the open end of the preform in an opening in the mold, sealing the open end of the preform with a flat plate bearing a gasket, and inflating it with compressed air through a hole in the sealing plate till the plastic conforms to the inner surface of the hollow mold. When this procedure is followed, it is found that by first raising the preform to a temperature just below its softening point and maintaining it there till exposed to more intense heat, it is possible to get the entire preform mass into a soft and pliable condition quickly enough, during the second stage of heating under rotation in a temperature gradient, to avoid getting the outer surface of the preform plastic blemished from overheating. The registration of the nipple in an axially located shaft positioned beyond the closed end of the preform during gradient heating permits the preform, which is rotated by means located concentrically at its open end, to be radially uniformly heated. At the same time, the low heat conductivity of the material of the shaft accommodating the nipple maintains the nipple in a relatively cool and firm condition and prevents it from swelling and shrinking excessively in the intense heat while the rest of the preform becomes sufficiently soft and pliable for expanding to the required size. When the preform is transferred to the open divided hollow mold and the relatively cool and firm nipple is registered in the recess at the end of the shaft protruding axially into the mold cavity, upon closure of the mold the preform is held very snugly and concentrically around the axis of the hollow mold cavity. When the preform is inflated from this position upon sealing of its open end, it expands both axially and radially, thereby pushing out of the mold cavity the spring biased shaft resting against its closed end.As the shaft is made to withdraw axially out of the mold cavity, it guides the nipple located in the center of the preform s closed end along the common axis of the preform and the mold cavity and prevents the center of the closed end of the preform from moving laterally from non uniform stresses induced by minor variations in wall thickness of the preform, which are inevitable when large and long preforms are being made. Moreover, the firmness of the nipple prevents it from bending and slipping out of the recess at the tip of the withdrawing shaft. Upon full expansion of the preform, the spring biased shaft is completely pushed put of the mold cavity and the plastic material conforms to the inner surface of the hollow mold and sets up on contact with the mold material which is at a substantially lower temperature than that of the plastic during expansion. The final symmetrical article has a radially uniform wall thickness ideal for high quality lighting enclosures. After the product is demolded, the sprue nipple, which is tiny in comparison to the size of the large blow molded article, is removed by any of a number of convenient means and the external spot from which it is removed is either finished to blend in with the surrounding surface texture or covered with a small trademark label or even left uncovered without detracting from the overall aesthetics of the finished product.The open end opposite the nipple is either left as it is with the flange around the open end intended to serve a further purpose such as the external holding of the article, or is routed to yield a hole of a suitable size to accommodate, say, a fitter in a lighting system. In the case of manufacture of lighting enclosures from thermoplastic materials such as acrylics, polycarbonates or polyethylenes, heat, which is the influence causing the material to become soft and pliable, can be supplied to the preform in any number of convenient forms since uniformity of heating in the axial direction is not particularly desirable and radial heating symmetry necessarily results from the uniform concentric rotation of the preform around its longitudinal axis. For example the preform can be rotated concentrically in a cylinder having a supply of hot air directly and symmetrically below the closed end of the preform. Radiant heating is also possible. Several heat lamps directed at the preform and affixed so as to cover the length of the preform give good results. Radiant heating can also be provided by fixing electric resistance heaters such as band or strip heaters to the outside of a cylinder at predetermined locations to give the desired heat gradient to a preform rotating concentrically inside the cylinder. Microwaves and hot oil circulating in tubes positioned around the rotating preform are other means of providing heat to the preform. Although the invention in its simplest form inherently produces a hollow object such as a lighting sphere symmetrical about its axis with a radially uniform wall which is generally less thick at radial points farther from the axis than at points closer to the axis, the procedure can easily be modified so as to alter the relative thickness of different parts of the sphere to induce the area of maximum expansion to be similar in thickness to that of the areas of least expansion, or to yield the greatest thickness in the area constituting the top of the sphere which may have to withstand most of the heat from the light source, or to obtain around the opening in the sphere a thick wall to withstand the pressures of clamping in a fitter.The simplest way to accomplish such a change in relative thickness is by modifying the heat transfer ability of different parts of the means generating the heating gradient either by appropriately altering the position of given heating elements or by proportionately reducing the quantity of heat energy being put out by heating elements in specific positions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION With reference now to Fig. 1, it can be seen that a preform is designated generally by the numeral 10. The preform 10 may be of any of the plastic materials identified above and is typically of a length of approximately 10 24 inches, a diameter of 2 1 2 8 inches, and a wall thickness on the order of 1 8 1 2 inch. The preform 10 includes a cylindrical body portion 12 leading to a closed end portion 14. Typically, the preform 10 is formed by an injection molding process, which molding process results in a characteristic nipple 16 at the closed end 14. The nipple 16 is typically of solid plastic material. At the end opposite the nipple 16 is a ring flange 18, the ring flange 18 being annular, with an opening corresponding to the inside diameter of the body portion 12. In accordance with the invention, the preforms 10 are typically maintained within an oven or heating chamber to maintain a temperature throughout the entire plastic composition. This temperature varies depending on the plastic used. For example, acrylic is heated to 1000 C., while polycarbonate is heated to approximately 1500 C. It will be appreciated that the preforms may be maintained at other elevated temperatures, it simply being desired that the preform be at a temperature above that of ambient for a sufficient period of time to be heated completely through. The preform 10 is then prepared for further heating by clamping the open end of the ring flange 18 as depicted in Fig. 2. Here, a bottom ring or annular disk 20 is positioned about the bottom of the ring flange 18 and a gasket 22 is placed about the upper circumferential surface thereof. A top disk 24 is then placed over the gasket 22 and thereby sealing the top opening of the preform 10. A motor shaft 26, sectionally shown, extends centrally from the top disk 24. Clamps 28 having appropriate lever arms 30 thereon, are then used to seal the disk 24 against the gasket 22. It should also be noted that a valve stem 32 communicates through the top plate 24 to the interior of the preform 10. As shown in Fig. 3, the motor shaft 26 is appropriately connected to a motor 34 and the preform 10 is placed into a heat chamber 36. The nipple 16 is received in a non heat transferring receptacle 38 at the bottom of the heat chamber 36 such that as the motor 34 is caused to rotate, the shaft 26 rotates the preform 10 about the shaft axis, which axis proceeds through the center of the preform 10 to the nipple 16.Accordingly, there is true axial rotation of the preform 10. If required, cooling means may be provided in association with the receptacle 38 to assure that the nipple 16 will not melt therein. Maintained within the heat chamber 36 are strip heaters or coils 40 44. Ultimately, a globe will be formed of the preform 10. Since the globe will be substantially spherical, it will be understood that the preform 10 will expand most greatly at the axial center portion thereof, with minimum expansion at either end thereof. Such an expansion would typically result in varying wall thicknesses, the wall thickness of the globe being thinnest at the center thereof, and thickest at each end. In order to achieve a more uniform wall thickness, a temperature gradient is established in the preform 10 by the heat chamber 36. This is preferably achieved by providing upper and lower strip heaters or coils 40 44, which are more resistive than the middle heater 42, such that for a given current the heat output of the coils 40, 44 will exceed that of the coil 42. Accordingly, when the coils 40 44 are interconnected to a power source 46, effectively interconnecting them between a voltage V and ground G, greater heat is imparted to the preform 10 at the top and bottom portions thereof.The motor 34 causes the preform 10 to rotate about the central axis such that radially uniform heating is attained, with there being an axial heating gradient as just described within the preform 10, but with the radial heating of the walls of the preform 10 being substantially uniform. The preform 10 is preferably brought to a temperature of approximately 1200 C. 2000 C., the temperature varying with the plastic material being utilized. In any event, after the preform 10 has been rotated within the heat chamber 36 for a sufficient period of time to assure substantially homogeneous heating of the wall thickness of the preform, with an axial gradient, the preform 10 is removed from the chamber. It should at this time be understood that the valve 32 has allowed the interior of the preform 10 to vent to the atmosphere, obviating the possibility of an implosion or explosion of the preform. Once removed from the heat chamber 36, the preform 10 is immediately placed within the cavity 50 of a mold 48, as shown in Figure 4. The cavity 50 is shown here as being spherical in order that a globe may be formed. Of course, other cavities 50 could take any of numerous geometric configurations. In any event, the nipple 16 of the preform 10 is received by a recess within a shaft 52, the shaft 52 being spring biased as by a spring 54. Before receiving the nipple 16 of the preform 10, the shaft 52 would typically protrude upward and centrally into the cavity 50 by urging of the spring 54. As the preform 10 is placed within the cavity 50, the nipple 16 is held by the shaft 52 which is pressed against the closed end of the preform by the urging of the spring 54.It will be appreciated that a recess might have been provided at the bottom of the spherical portion of the cavity 50, much in the same manner as in the heat chamber 36 of Fig. 3. However, by providing the shaft 52 with a nipple receiving recess therein, various sizes of preforms 10 may be used with the mold 48. Conversely, a single size of preform 10 may also be used with various mold sizes. With the heated preform 10 within the cavity 50, a source of air pressure is connected to the valve stem 32 by means of a pressure hose 56. The air pressure causes the preform 10 to expand within the cavity 50 thereby pushing the shaft 52 axially out of the cavity and causing the preform to ultimately take the shape of the cavity which is the shape of a globe.With the preform 10 held by engagement of the nipple 16 with the shaft 52, there is no chance of internal shift of the preform axis as the globe is being formed, and this, coupled with the axial gradient heating discussed above, results in a globe of substantially uniform wall thickness. As shown in Fig. 5, the result of the molding process of Fig. 4 is a globe like structure still having the characteristic nipple 16 and the ring flange 18, the flange 18 now extending from a neck. A finished globe 60 is shown in Fig. 6 and is obtained from the structure of Fig. 5 by cutting off the neck as with a band saw, and routing out the opening as at 58 for receiving a light mounting plate or the like. The nipple 16 is similarly cut off and may be buffed or simply covered with a small label.The resulting globe is of high purity, absent surface blemishes, of substantially uniform wall thickness, lightweight, and impatt resistant. A preferred material for making the blow molded lighting fixtures is acrylic, technically called polymethyl methacrylate. An exemplary use of acrylic is Injection molded preforms of acrylic are first preheated from the ambient temperature to a temperature of .1000 C. 2120 F. . The preforms are maintained at that temperature till they are further heated to the blow molding temperature. For blow molding the preforms, they are removed from the preheating oven and transferred to a heating cylinder maintained at approximately 2000 C. 3920 F. .They are rotated centrally in the cylinder such that the cylinder wall is about two inches away from the preform wall. Preforms that have a nominal wall thickness of 1 4 inch are heated in the cylinder, while they are rotating, for about four minutes each. To make globes of 16 and 18 diameters, the preforms need to be heated a little more than four minutes. For smaller size globes, a little less time is used. The temperature of the acrylic at the end of those four minutes of heating is not accurately known.There are two temperature gradients one should be aware of. Along the length of the preform, the temperature is highest at the ends and lowest in the middle. Also, the temperature of the outer surface of the acrylic is higher than the inner surface, which is furthest from the cylinder wall. Depending on the heating time and the specific part of the preform in question, the acrylic temperature would be in the range of 125 to 1500 C. 260 to 3000 F. . At the end of the heating, the preforms are immediately transferred to the blow mold and inflated with air at ambient temperature at a pressure of 20 to 30 psi. The acrylic cools rapidly after touching the blow mold surface and the formed globe can be removed from the mold after release of the air within a minute after it is formed. Figure 7 further illustrates the special apparatus used to practice the method of the invention.One half of the divided mold 48 is shown with a mold cavity 50 having a surface of a preselected shape corresponding to the desired outer configuration of the final product. The mold is open at one end for accommodating the open end of the preform not shown .A shaft 52 is provided at the bottom of mold cavity 50. Shaft 52 is biased into cavity 50 by means of spring 54. A recess 64 is provided in the end of shaft 52 for receiving the nipple of the preform not shown .Shaft 52 is retractable from cavity 50. Preferably, just the pressure of the expanding preform is needed to retract shaft 52. Alternatively, other means may be used. For example, shaft 52 could be screwed into mold 48 and retracted from mold 48 by unscrewing during expansion of the preform. From the foregoing it can be seen that my invention includes a process for blow molding a seamless, hollow, radially symmetrical thermoplastic article having a uniform wall thickness at any given axial position. In its preferred embodiments the process includes the step of providing an essentially cylindrical preform of a thermoplastic material. The preform has an open and a closed end. The longitudinal axis of the preform passes through the two ends.The preform also has a nipple on the outside of the closed end along the longitudinal axis. The next step in the process involves registering the nipple in a recess on a shaft that also has a longitudinal axis.The preform is then rotated about an axis of rotation coincident with the longitudinal axis of the preform and with the longitudinal axis of the first shaft. The preform is heated during the rotation until the preform is sufficiently heated to be pliable and yet the nipple is still firm. The preform is then removed from the shaft and transferred to an open divided mold. The mold has a cavity with a longitudinal axis. The inner surface of the cavity is of a preselected shape that is symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the cavity.This preselected shape corresponds to the outer shape of the final article. The nipple is then registered in the second recess which is formed on the end of the second shaft which protudes into the mold cavity. This second shaft is spring biased into the cavity. The shaft lies along the longitudinal axis of the cavity. The open end of the pliable preform is then grasped by closing the mold. In this manner the longitudinal axis of the preform is held coincident with the longitudinal axis of the cavity. A flat plate is used to seal the open end of the pliable preform. The preform is then inflated by introducing compressed air through a hole in the flat plate. As the preform expands it pushes the second shaft out of the mold cavity. The preform then conforms to the inner surface of the cavity to form the article from the preselected shape of the cavity. After cooling, the partially formed article is removed from the mold and the nipple is removed from the article to form the final article. The invention has been described in detail with particular emphasis on the preferred embodiments, but it should be understood that there are variations and modifications within the scope and spirit of the invention.
