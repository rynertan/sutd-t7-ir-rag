# Light sensitive detection circuit.

## Abstract
Light sensitive detection circuit in which the output signal of a light sensitive element 1 is stabilised by means of a feed back to an element 2 having a voltage dependent resistance, which element 2 is connected in series with the light sensitive element 1 between two points of fixed potential.
