# Torque variation absorbing device.

## Abstract
The torque variation absorbing device comprises a driv ing plate 2 , a flywheel 6 , and a spring mechanism 12 , a damping and torque limiting mechanism 15 and a hysteresis mechanism 18 installed between the driving plate 2 and the flywheel 6 . The flywheel 6 is divided into a flywheel body 6a and a driven plate 6b which are connected together by a bolt 10 screwed into a bolt hole 23 in the flywheel body 6a and the driven plate 6b . The bolt hole 23 provided in the driven plate 6b extends through the driven plate 6b up to a sliding friction plane between the hysteresis mechanism 18 and the driven plate 6b . The dust generated by the friction of the hys teresis mechanism 18 can be collected into the bolt hole 23 .
