# APPARATUS FOR MIXING CHEMICAL COMPONENTS

## Abstract
Described herein is an apparatus for producing a mixture of chemical components which comprises an elongated housing containing a a tube extending there through having at least one inlet means for supplying at least one component into said tube whereby said components flow from said inlet means to outlet means at the other end of said tube b inlet means for supplying a least one component either reactive with one or more components of a or catalyzing the reaction of two or more components of a , said inlet means in communication with an annular groove within a conical member which receives said component s , c means for distributing said component s from the annular groove to a plurality of grooves in said conical member, said grooves directing the component s into the flow of the component s of a in said tube.
