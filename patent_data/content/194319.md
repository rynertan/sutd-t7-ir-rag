# APPARATUS FOR TRANSFERRING ELECTRONIC PARTS.

## Abstract
An apparatus for transferring electronic parts such as IC s which are packed in a cassette or a stick in an electronic part inserting machine. In this apparatus, a part of a transfer passage is made movable to two positions, i.e. a position which an electronic part passes in normal operation, and a withdrawn position which is out of the transfer passage, whereby an electronic part can be supplied by passing the sequentially arranged electronic parts, when a failure of insertion of an electronic part occurs.
