# PRODUCTION OF UNSATURATED HYDROCARBONS BY DEHYDROGENATION

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the production of unsaturated compounds by dehydrogenation of a corres ponding saturated compound in the fluid phase in the presence of a supported gallium compound as catalyst. The support is a tectometallosilicate which has the following composition in terms of the mole ratios of the oxides
