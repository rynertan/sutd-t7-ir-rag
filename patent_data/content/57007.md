# Process for the production of glycollic acid esters.

## Abstract
In a process for producing a glycollic acid ester by the vapor phase catalytic hydrogenation of an oxalic acid diester in the presence of a catalyst and hydrogen gas, the improvement wherein the oxalic acid diester in the vaporous state is contacted with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst composed of Ag or Pd supported on a solid carrier at a temperature of from about 120 C to about 300 C.
