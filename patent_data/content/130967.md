# Heat recovery from concentrated sulfuric acid.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for the recovery of heat from a sulfuric acid process are provided. Sulfur trioxide is absor bed into hot concentrated sulfuric acid having a concentra tion greater than 98 and less than 101 and a temperature greater than 120 C, in a heat recovery tower 60 , and the heat created by the exothermic reaction is recovered in a useful form in a heat exchanger 62 .
