## Description
IMPACT PROMOTERS FOR MINERAL FILLED THERMOPLASTICS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to mineral filled thermoplastic polymer compositions containing an impact promoter. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of mineral fillers for thermoplastic polymer compositions is well known in the art. Such filler compositions are typically used to improve certain physical properties of the matrix polymer. Since mineral fillers often are as costly on a volume basis as the low cost resins such as the polyolefins, fillers are mostly used for the purpose of creating new materials of increased value, due to the altered physical properties as compared to the unfilled polymer matrix. The filled thermoplastic polymers typically are comprised of the matrix polymer, a mineral filler, and an interface agent. Of importance then is the combination of properties that can be achieved for a given polymer filler interface agent system, such combination of properties typically being referred to as a property profile. The property profile thus determines the practical utility of the filled plastic. The mineral fillers when incorporated into ductile plastics have some beneficial effects with respect to certain physical properties of the filled material while also causing some adverse effects on other aspects of the property profile of the composite material. In general, the addition of mineral fillers increases stiffness, as measured by tensile modulus and flexural modulus, while decreasing elongation at break, otherwise known as ductility, and impact strength, as measured by the notched Izod test. Such decreases in the ductility and impact strength are often severe. The strength properties which result from the addition of a mineral filler to a thermoplastic material may increase or decrease depending upon a number of factors. Certain interface agents can dramatically improve the property profile of individual polymer filler systems by lessening the deleterious effects of the filler while preserving the improvements in other properties, such as tensile modulus and flexural modulus. It is also sometimes possible to minimize by the use of certain interface agents, the adverse effects of the environment on a given composition, such as to improve its retention of properties after exposure to water, high temperature, and or actinic radiation. For a general background on the physical properties of polymeric materials, with and without particulate fillers, reference is made to the book by Lawrence E. Nielsen entitled Mechanical Properties of Polymers and Composites , New York Marcel Dekker 1974, particularly to chapters 5 and 7, and to the appended bibliography. The specific question of how to simultaneously achieve high modulus, high ductility and impact strength in thermoplastics is discussed in more detail by L.C. Cessna in the article entitled Dilatometric Studies of Polymers Undergoing High and Low Rate Tensile Deformation , Polymer Engineering and Science, Vol. 14, 10, p. 696 701 1974 , and the references quoted therein. The foregoing studies suggest that microcavitation, i.e., microvoid formation during deformation, can result in an enormous increase in the internal surface area during deformation, and that this may be the predominant energy absorbing mechanism even for unfilled, high modulus, ductile polymer systems at the high strain rates typical of impact testing. For studies of microcavitation in filled systems, further reference is made to the articles by Nam P. Suh et al. entitled Strain Rate Sensitive Tough Fibre Reinforced Composites , J. of Materials Science, Vol. 12, pp. 239 250 1977 , and Void Nucleation of Particulate Filler Polymeric Materials, pp. 46 48 of the preprints from the 34th Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers, Boston, May 4 7, 1981, and the references cited therein.These papers show that interposing a liquid e.g., silicone grease interface between a matrix resin and fibers or particular fillers, respectively, can indeed increase the toughness of these composites by facilitating the formation of microvoids. However, the authors clearly recognized the limitations of the approach by stating on page 250 of the former article that the viscous coating reduces the static properties of the composite such as its tensile and flexural strengths and suggested that the concept could best be utilized where the amount of one time energy absorption is the primary design parameter. The approach was useful for products which must be able to resist one impact event only without catastrophic failure, although the material has been damaged to the extent that it will not withstand a second event.Examples of such specialty applications were safety related products such as highway guard rails, safety helmets and circuit breaker boxes. For a more general discussion of the different types of interface agents and their use in the prior art, reference is made to U.S. A 4,385,136 and 4,409,342 and to the references quoted therein. Effective interface agents for mineral filled thermoplastics fall into 2 broad categories, namely those that are chemically active and those that have no chemical groups capable of reaction with the matrix polymer. The first type is believed to work by a mechanism whereby the polymer interphase region surrounding each filler particle is chemically modified by the interface agent so that it becomes considerably tougher than the original matrix resin.The second type, on the other hand, is believed to debond the filler particles from the matrix resin, thus sometimes increasing the toughness by facilitating microcavitation, but usually at a severe sacrifice in both strength and stiffness. Actually, most additives that are presently used as dispersing and processing aids, i.e. most lubricants and surfactants, have only very minor effects on the mechanical properties of the filled polymer. Many evaluations of additives for filled polymers described in the prior art are misleading because the data are incomplete or misinterpreted. For example, some additives act as plasticizers and thus reduce the stiffness of a given filled thermoplastic by softening the matrix which often is an undesirable effect. On the other hand, an increase in stiffness can be an indication of filler agglomeration i.e. poor dispersion hence, a high modulus is not necessarily a beneficial result for a particular additive agent as explained further below. In contrast, since agglomeration invariably reduces the tensile strength because poorly dispersed fillers cause large flaws, a high tensile strength is always a beneficial interface effect. The property profile which is important for practical utility is a combination of improved impact and ductility, unchanged or only slightly reduced strength and stiffness, and good retention of these properties after environmental exposure to moisture, heat or sunlight. This property combination is also the most difficult one to achieve, especially with interface agents that are incapable of chemical interactions with the matrix resin. The relationship between particle aggregation and viscosity of suspensions was studied by T.B. Lewis and Lawrence Nielsen and reported in the Transactions of the Society of Rheology, Vol. 12, pp. 421 443 1968 . According to these studies, the viscosity of liquid dispersions and similarly, the modulus of filled, solid polymers decreases with improvements in the dispersion of particular fillers. The reason for this is that part of the liquid or plastic matrix is entrapped in the interstitial spaces in an agglomerate, hence reducing the amount of free liquid plastic solid available for the particles to move in. As the agglomerates are broken down, mechanically and or by the action of dispersing agents, more liquid solid becomes available for the particles to move in and the viscosity modulus decreases. The strength of a material is a statistical property in that the size and distribution of defects or flaws in the specimen determine the magnitude of loading a given sample can withstand before failure. For this reason, large filler particles quite generally result in lower composite strength than smaller ones, and in case of undispersed and mechanically weak agglomerates, the phenomenon is aggravated by the possible breakage of the agglomerates themselves. Because of the complex mechanisms described above, the practical utility of a potential interface agent requires a quite complete evaluation of the physical property profile of the filler polymer system in which it is used. Most studies reported in the literature are very incomplete in this respect and considerable caution must therefore be exercised in accepting the statements of the authors. For a perspective on the prior art for non reactive interface agents, reference is made to some recent survey articles. Organic titanates have been reviewed extensively by S.J. Monte, G. Sugarman et al. in two papers entitled The Theory of Organo Titanate Coupling Agents and The Application of Titanate Coupling Agents , pp. 27 34 and p. 35 39, respectively, in the preprints of the 34th Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers, Atlantic City, New Jersey, April 26 29, 1976. Chlorinated paraffins have been reviewed in a paper entitled Low Cost Filler Coupling Agent for Polyolefins by D. Stevenson et al., pp. 1 4 of the preprints for session 9 B of the 36th Annual Conference of the Reinforced Plastics Composites Institute of the Society of the Plastics Industry, Washington, D.C., February 16 20, 1981.An organic interface agent of undisclosed composition has been discussed by de Souza et al. in a paper entitled Low Cost Highly Filled Impact Resistant Thermoplastic Composites, pp. 492 496 in the preprints of the 37th Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers, New Orleans, Louisiana, May 7 10, 1979. A detailed overview of surface treatments and preparation techniques for calcium carbonate is presented in an article by T. Nakatsuka entitled Surface Modification of Calcium Carbonate for Polymer Composites , published in H. Ishida and G. Kumar ed. , Molecular Characterization of Polymer Composites , New York Plenum Press , 1985. Non reactive interface agents have some important advantages over the chemically reactive agents referred to above. First, precisely because the chemically non reactive agents act by physical means only, they are generally much less sensitive to differences in processing conditions, thus making the same composite formulation usable for many different fabrication processes. Second, they are for the same reason generally very low in toxicity, which has advantages both in handling and in certain, critical applications of filled polymers.Third, in contrast to the chemically reactive agents, which usually do not give additive effects by simple combination with a non reactive agent, all non reactive species can often be combined with themselves with beneficial results for example, highly hydrophobic interface agents will usually convey improved moisture resistance to a filled polymer when substituted for part of a less hydrophobic impact promoter without significant sacrifice in the other physical properties. As polyethylene is one of the most widely used low cost resins, a need continually exists for improving the property profile of polyethylene based resins. It has been well known to use mineral fillers in combination with a polyethylene type matrix polymer to increase its tensile modulus and flexural modulus. However, to date, there continues to exist a need for non reactive interface agents, generally, and in particular for non reactive interface agents which are capable of increasing the impact strength of such mineral filled polyethylene type resins while not substantially adversely affecting the strength and modulus of the filled polyethylene type resin. The need continues to exist, in part, because of the lack of predictability of the efficacy of any individual non reactive interface agent when combined with any particular combination of resin and filler. One may refer, for example, to U.S. A 4,385,136, which in Table III, Columns 11 and 12, lists a dozen typical, non reactive chemicals. The subsequent examples demonstrate that such chemicals when used as additives in filled polyolefins typically do not provide composite materials with attractive and useful property profiles. For example, Example 1, Table 1, Column 19 shows that isopropyl tri isostearyl titanate severely reduces strength, stiffness and impact, while increasing ductility in aluminium trihydrate filled polyethylene. As another illustration, Example 3, Table 3, Column 20, demonstrates that iso stearic acid, while improving the impact strength, has little effect on the strength, stiffness, and ductility over a control sample without such an additive, in clay filled high density polyethylene. An object of the present invention is to provide non reactive impact promoters which are useful in conjunction with certain combinations of mineral fillers and resins. Another object of the present invention is to provide non reactive impact promoters which are useful in increasing the impact strength of certain mineral filled resins, when compared to the same compositions without said promoter. Additionally, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for improving the impact strength of a mineral filled resin composition without substantially impairing the strength and modulus of said composition. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for concurrently reducing the moisture sensitivity of a mineral filled resin composition while improving the impact strength of said composition, without substantially impairing the strength and modulus of the composition SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there have now been discovered certain mineral filled thermoplastic compositions comprising a polymer selected from the group consisting of polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers an appropriate mineral filler selected from the group consisting of aluminum trihydrate, magnesium hydrate, calcium carbonate, calcium magnesium carbonates, barium titanate and neodymium titanate and a sufficient amount of an appropriate impact promoter selected from the group consisting of tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate, isostearic acid, and dodecylpyridinium salts, to increase the impact strength of the composition when compared to the same composition without said promoter being present. There has also been discovered a method for improving the impact strength of a composition wherein said composition comprises a polymer selected from polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, and an appropriate mineral filler selected from aluminium trihydrate, magnesium hydrate, calcium carbonate, calcium magnesium carbonates, barium titanate and neodymium, titanate, said method comprising incorporating into said composition a sufficient amount of an appropriate impact promoter selected from tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate, isostearic acid, and dodecylpyridinium salts, to improve the impact strength of said composition without substantially impairing the strength or modulus, as compared to the same composition without said impact promoter. Surprisingly, it has been found that there is a great deal of selectivity with respect to the choice of an impact promoter for any particular polymer filler combination. Thus, when the polymer is polyethylene and the filler is aluminum trihydrate or magnesium hydrate, the appropriate impact promoter is tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate. When the polymer is polyethylene and the filler is calcium carbonate or a calcium magnesium carbonate, the appropriate impact promoter is either isostearic acid or a dodecylpyridinium salt. Finally, when the polymer is an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and the filler is barium titanate or neodymium titanate, the appropriate impact promoter is isostearic acid. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it has been found that certain mineral filled thermosplastic compositions can have their impact strength improved in accordance with the aforementioned invention, while also having their sensitivity to moisture reduced by incorporating into said composition a sufficient amount of an appropriate impact promoter to improve the impact strength of said mineral filled composition and a sufficient amount of a hydrophobic agent to cause a reduction in moisture sensitivity, as compared to the same mineral filled composition without said impact promoter and hydrophobic agent.Advantageously, such a combined effect of improvement in impact strength and reduction in moisture sensitivity can be achieved for the particular mineral filled compositions specified herein with an additive composition comprising a hydrophobic agent and an impact promoter selected from the group consisting of tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate, isostearic acid, and dodecylpyridinium salts, wherein the weight ratio of hydrophobic agent to impact promotor is from 1 20 to 1 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As suggested above, one of the findings of the present invention is that certain combinations of non reactive interface agents, sometimes referred to herein as impact promoters, along with certain mineral fillers are effective in producing certain thermoplastic compositions having improved property profiles, especially increased impact strength, as measured by the notched Izod test, without substantially impairing the strength or modulus, as compared to the same composition without said impact promoter. One of the surprising aspects of the present invention was the finding that the efficacy of the particular interface agents is highly dependent upon the particular combination of both filler and polymer type.Thus, it has been found that an interface agent which is useful in conjunction with one particular type of mineral filler, such as calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonates, and one particular polymer, such as polyethylene, may not be, and probably will not be, effective for a different mineral filler such as clay or talc and the same polymer, or for the same filler type and a different polymer, such as polypropylene. The reason for the selectivity of the particular interface agent and the particular filler resin systems is not understood or predictable, at the present state of the art. The polyethylenes used in the present invention are the normally solid grades of polyethylene and the nonpolar copolymers or ethylene with other hydrocarbon monomers such as propylene, butene, hexene, neohexene and 4 methyl pentene. The polyethylene may further contain residual unsaturation enabling subsequent curing or cross linking as can be achieved, for example, by co or terpolymerization with diene monomers such as ethylidene norbornene. Specifically preferred are the commercially available, normally solid, grades of polyethylene. A preferred grade is high pressure, low density polyethylene having a density of 0.91 to 0.94 and a melt index of 0.1 to 50. Another preferred polyethylene is linear, low density polyethylene having a density of 0.90 to 0.94 and a melt index os 0.01 to 50. A most preferred polyethylene is high density polyethylene having a density of 0.94 to 0.97 and a melt index of 0.01 to 50, preferably 0.05 to 10. The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers used in the present invention are the normally solid copolymers of ethylene with vinyl acetate, wherein the vinyl acetate content is from 2 to 50 percent, usually from 5 to 40 percent, by weight. The mineral fillers which are useful in the present invention, as stated above, are aluminum trihydrate hydroxide or oxid , magnesium hydrate hydroxide or oxid , calcium carbonate, calcium magnesium carbonates, barium titanate and neodymium titanate. Illustrative of carbonate mineral fillers are the natural calcite, dolomite, and limestone products calcium and magnesium carbonates which may be ground or provided in precipitated synthetic forms. The amount of mineral filler, by weight, present in any composition of the present invention is usually from 5 to 85 percent, typically from 10 to 65 percent. The non reactive interface agents which are useful as impact promoters in the context of the present invention are tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate, isostearic acid, and dodecylpyridinium salts. The dodecylpyridinium salts which are useful in the present invention include dodecylpyridinium halides, such as dodecylpyridinium chloride, as well as dodecylpyridinium sulfate, dodecylpyridinium acetate, and other known salts. The amount of impact promoter present in any given composition, should be sufficient to increase the impact strength of the composition, when compared to the same composition without said promoter being present. The impact promoters of the present invention can thus substantially increase the impact strength of the specific mineral filled compositions. A substantial increase in impact strength can be determined by considering the notched Izod values of the mineral filled compositions, both with and without the presence of the impact promoters. Materials having notched Izod values equal to or less than 0.5 ft.lbs. 0.069 m.kg per inch 25.4 mm of notch are sufficiently brittle so that they will crack upon falling from table height onto a hard floor. Materials having notched Izod values of about 1 ft. lb. per inch of notch are commonly recognized as being non brittle , although perhaps not quite considered tough . Materials having notched Izod values around 2 ft.lbs. 0.277 m.kg per inch 25.4 mm of notch will normally withstand being dropped onto a hard floor from table height. Materials having notched Izod values equal to or greater than 5 ft.lbs. 0.69 m.kg per inch 25.4 mm of notch are difficult to break when hit with a hammer. A substantial improvement in impact strength is thus one which is noticeable within the foregoing practical scale. It is an especially advantageous feature of the present invention that the impact promoter, when selected in accordance with the present invention and used in a suitable amount, will have the aforementioned beneficial result on impact strength without substantially impairing the strength or modulus, as compared to the same composition without said promoter. A substantial impairment of strength or modulus would be indicated by a greater than one third reduction of both strength and stiffness values, as compared to the same mineral filled composition without the interface agent. Because non reactive interface agents act by the mechanism of microcavitation, such reductions in the static properties imply that the material might fail in some practical applications, due to reduced strength or due to excessive creep, under long term static loads. Usually, the promoter will be present in an amount, based upon the weight of the filler, from 0.5 to 10 percent, typically 1 to 5 percent. In an embodiment of the process of the present invention, the impact promoters may be admixed with the filler by stirring the promoter with the filler, using a solution containing a solvent which is allowed to evaporate before compounding the filler into the thermoplastic polymer. This is done to assure uniformity of distribution for the various impact promoters onto the fillers since the chemicals vary greatly in physical form, i.e., liquid vs. solid, in viscosity, melting point and the like. In practice, less expensive methods are preferred.These methods would include the impact promoter being used as a filler pretreatment, e.g., from an aqueous dispersion by spray tumbling in a ribbon blender by mechanically mixing the promoter at high shear as a liquid or solid which is predispersed or dissolved in other ingredients, if any by direct addition of the promoter to the resin and filler before or during compounding or as a concentrate in the polymer. The filler and impact promoter may be dispersed in the polymer by processes such as banburying, milling, extrusion including twin screw extrusion and the like. The hydrophobic agents may likewise be added in a manner similar to that described above for the impact promoters. The hydrophobic agents used in the present invention, as indicated, may be present in an amount which is sufficient to reduce the moisture sensitivity of the composition. Moisture sensitivity of a composition is usually shown, for example, by loss of mechanical properties upon exposure to moisture, as water or water vapor. A typical result of moisture sensitivity would be embrittlement of the composition upon exposure to moisture. The hydrophobic agents of the present invention thus reduce the tendency of the compositions to lose mechanical properties upon exposure to moisture. In the context of this invention, a hydrophobic agent is defined as a chemical with a non polar moiety having a polarity lower than that of polyethylene. The polarity of a moiety can be calculated in terms of the Hildebrand solubility parameter by the method of group contributions see, for example, D.W. Van Krevelen, Properties of Polymers, 2nd Edition, Amsterdam New York Elsevier , 1976. Since there is some variation in values for group contributions F value molar attraction constant and in molar volumes cm 3 mole among different authors, those of Van Krevelen in tables 4.4, page 56 and Table 7.2, page 134 are specified. Furthermore, since tetravalent silicon is not listed in the tables discussed above, the values for this group are listed below EMI16.1 Molar Attraction Constant 64 Joule 1 2 . cm 3 2 per mole 32 cal 1 2 . cm 3 2 per mole Molar Volume 29.1 cm 3 mole Among moieties having solubility parameters lower than that of polyethylene which is 8.3 cal 1 2 . cm 3 2 are trimethyl silyl, dimethyl siloxyl, poly dimethylsiloxane , perfluoromethyl, poly tetrafluoroethylene , isobutenyl, poly isobutene , butadienyl, poly butadiene ,etc. The hydrophobic agent may have a hydrophilic moiety which can be ionic or non ionic. Typical anionic groups are carboxylate, sulfonate, phosphate, and the like, while typical cationic groups may be amines or quaternized ammonium. Examples of non ionic groups are ethers, alcohols and esters, e.g. ethylene oxide, carbohydrates, etc. However, the original hydrophobic agent need not contain such hydrophilic moieties since they can be formed by oxidation during the hot compounding operation of the filled thermoplastic polymer. Of particular utility are hydrophobic agents as discussed above, which are either organosilicon based or organofluorine based. The hydrophobic agents used in the present invention are usually present in combination with the impact promoters of the present invention such that from 5 to 50 percent of the combination is the hydrophobic agent and from 50 to 95 percent of the combination is the impact promoter. Preferably, the weight ratio of the hydrophobic agent to the impact promoter is from 1 1 to 1 9, more preferably 1 4 to 1 9. The present invention will be further described by the following examples which are for the purpose of further illustrating the present invention . PREPARATION OF THE SAMPLES Except as otherwise indicated, in all of the following examples, the filler pretreatment procedure consisted of dissolving about 10 g of impact promoter in enough solvent, e.g., acetone, to dissolve the promoter, but less than the amount of solvent which would produce a paste with the wetted filler. The promoter solution was then added to 500 g of filler, blended mechanically and air dried overnight. The pretreated filler was compounded with 250 g of thermoplastic polymer on a 6 by 12 152.4 mm x 305 mm 2 roll mill at 180 DEG C by adding 250 g of pretreated filler incrementally to the fluxed polymer. Mixing was continued using thorough compounding procedures. A sheet of the treated, filled polymer was then cut and rolled into a cylindrical bar, i.e. pig , and then passed end wise through the compounding mill about ten times for a total mixing time of ten minutes after the filler had been added. The product composition was then sheeted off the mill, allowed to cool to room temperature and granulated in a granulator. TESTING OF THE SAMPLES The following testing procedures were used for each product composition. The granulated product composition was injection molded at a melt temperature of 215 DEG C using a 38 cm 3 capacity, 30 ton reciprocating screw injection machine with a mold providing an ASTM dog bone test bar with dimensions of 2 by 1 2 by 1 8 51 x 12.7 x 3.8 mm for testing tensile properties, and a rectangular bar with dimensions of 5 by 1 2 by 1 8 305 x 154 x 3.8 mm for testing flexural properties. The following tests were used for each product composite EMI19.1 During the tension and flexural tests a cross head speed of 0.2 51 mm per minute was utilized. DEFINITIONS The chemical designations used in the examples are defined as follows EMI19.2 EMI20.1 Example 1 Comparative Unfilled Polymers This example demonstrates the typical property profile of the polyethylene and polypropylene polymers used in the subsequent examples, when no filler or interface agent is present. The high density polyethylene and the polypropylene homopolymer used in the following samples were milled, injection molded and tested except that no filler or interface agents were added. The results were as follows EMI21.1 The foregoing data enables comparison with data for the filled polymers in the subsequent examples to illustrate the improved mechanical properties which can be achieved when using selected fillers in combination with the proper impact promoters of this invention. Example 2 ATH HDPE This example shows the utility of TOF as an impact promoter for aluminum trihydrate filled HDPE, in comparison to some conventional treatments. Aluminum Trihydrate ATH filled HDPE 50 wt. filler samples, the ATH having been pretreated with the agents listed below, were prepared and tested with the results being as follows EMI21.2 The data shows that TOF is a most effective impact promoter for this filler polymer system, increasing the notched Izod strength from 0.297 to over 1.244 mkg 2 to over 9 ft.lbs inch 25.4 mm of notch as compared to the control sample with no treatment agent. This substantial increase in toughness occurs at little expense in strength. The stiffness, although reduced relative to that of the untreated control, is still well above that of the unfilled polymer as seen by comparison with the data in Example 1. In contrast, conventional treatments such as Calcium Stearate or the titanate lubricant ITIT only modestly increase or even reduce the toughness as compared to the untreated filler. EDMS, an ethoxylated dimethyl siloxane fluid with 7 8 ethylene oxide units molecule, is also superior to CSTA and ITIT.Furthermore, EDMS provides superior retention of composite physical properties after extended exposure to water. This effect is observed also in TOF EDMS blends enabling formulations which have superior property combinations than those achievable with each material by itself as illustrated in Example 9 below. Example 3 CaCO3 HDPE This example shows the utility of dodecylpyridinium chloride as as impact promoter for calcium carbonate filled HDPE, in comparison to other treatments. The following samples were prepared and tested as in Example 2 except that the filler was CaCO3 EMI23.1 The data shows that DDPC is a superior impact promoter for CaCO3 in HDPE, giving more than a tripling in impact strength as compared to untreated filler with good retention of strength and stiffness, particularly in flexure. The three silane and fluoroalkyl compounds are less beneficial for impact, although other mechanicals are quite good. Again, the combination of DDPC with the latter hydrophobic agents result in impact promoter formulations providing superior water resistance with only minor loss of the excellent impact contribution provided by straight DDPC. Example 4 CaCO3 HDPE This example shows the utility of isostearic acid as an impact promoter for calcium carbonate filled HDPE, in comparison to other treatments. The samples shown in the following table were prepared and tested as described in Example 3 EMI23.2 ISTA is shown to be an excellent impact promoter for CaCO3 in HDPE, tripling the impact strength while retaining acceptable strength and stiffness. Two silanes and one fluoroalkyl compound are seen to provide good over all properties, although the impact improvement is somewhat less than that offered by ISTA. The combination of ISTA with silicones, or fluoroalkyl agents again provides superior water resistance as compared to ISTA by itself. These results are markedly superior to those attainable with STA or metal stearates. Example 5 Comparative Clay HDPE This comparative example demonstrates that isostearic acid is not effective in clay filled HDPE, as an impact promoter. These samples were prepared as those of Example 3 except that hydrous clay was used instead of calcium carbonate EMI24.1 The foregoing data shows that ISTA is not effective in clay filled high density polyethylene in spite of its excellent performance on calcium carbonate in the same polymer, as shown in Example 3. Example 6 Comparative Talc HDPE This comparative example demonstrates that isostearic acid is not an effective impact promoter for talc filled HDPE. The samples shown below were prepared as those in Example 4 except that talc was used as the filler EMI25.1 The foregoing data shows that ISTA is no better than zinc stearate when used on talc in the same polymer as before, again illustrating the surprising specificity of the non reactive impact promoters of this invention. Example 7 Comparative ATH PP This comparative example demonstrates that tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate is not an effective impact promoter for ATH filled polypropylene. These samples were prepared as those in Example 3 except that polypropylene was used as the polymer EMI25.2 The foregoing data shows again the surprising specificity of the impact promoters. In spite of the excellent performance in ATH filled HDPE as shown in Example 2, TOF is no better than stearic acid or calcium stearate in ATH filled polypropylene. Example 8 Comparative CaCO3 PP This comparative example shows that isostearic acid is not an effective impact promoter for calcium carbonate filled polypropylene. The samples shown below were prepared as described in Example 4 except that polypropylene was used as the polymer EMI26.1 Again it is seen that, although ISTA is an excellent impact promoter for CaCO3 in HDPE as shown in Example 4, it is quite ineffective with the same filler in polypropylene homopolymer. Example 9 ATH HDPE This example shows that by using both an impact promoter and a hydrophobic agent in accordance with the present invention, an ATH mineral filled composition can be obtained which will have a reduced sensitivity to moisture, along with good mechanical properties. ATH 50 wt was compounded into HDPE by the same procedure as in Example 2 except that the samples were sheeted off the mill 10 mils thickness 0.254 mm and allowed to cool to room temperature instead of being injection molded. In addition to the ATH, samples were prepared containing TOF an an impact promoter, EDMS as a hydrophobic agent, and both TOF and EDMS, as shown below where the percentages are by weight based upon the weight of the ATH. Strips of the various formulations were then immersed in 95 DEG C water for 7 days, after which they were removed, allowed to cool to room temperature, and manually inspected with the following results EMI27.1 The foregoing demonstrates that beneficial water resistance can be obtained by the addition of EDMS, even as a minor component, to ATH filled polyethylene. At this level, no discernible effect on mechanicals were seen before water exposure. Example 10 CaCO3 HDPE This example shows that by using both an impact promoter and a hydrophobic agent in accordance with the present invention, a CaCO3 mineral filled composition can be obtained which will have a reduced sensitivity to moisture, along with good mechanical properties. CaCO3 was compounded into HDPE and tested as described in Example 9 except that the hot water exposure was for 48 hours. In addition to the CaCO3, samples were prepared containing ISTA as an impact promoter, PFAP as a hydrophobic agent, and both CaCO3 and PFAP, as shown below where the percentages are by weight based upon the weight of the CaCO3 The results were as follows EMI27.2 Again, the beneficial effect of PFAP is obtained even when used as a minor component together with ISTA in polyethylene. No impairment of mechanicals over straight ISTA was observed before water exposure. Example 11 BaTiO3 EVA This example shows that EVA containing barium titanate as a mineral filler may have its ductility increased by the addition of isostearic acid. The samples listed below were prepared as follows 1000 g of BaTiO3 powder was charged to a laboratory blender to which was added 70g of one of the liquid additives listed below. After 15 minutes of mixing, 940g of the treated BaTiO3 was removed for later use. Separately, 60g of EVA resin was fluxed on a 152 x 305 mm two roll mill at a roll temperature of 82 DEG C 180 DEG F . After the resin had softened sufficiently, the 940g of treated BaTiO3 or 875g in case of untreated BaTiO3 was incrementally added on the mill until a coherent mixture was obtained. The hot blend was then fed to an inverted L 203 x 152.4 mm four roll calender operated at the following roll temperatures offset roll 82 DEG C 180 DEG F , top roll 85 DEG C 185 DEG F , middle roll 87.5 DEG C 190 DEG F and bottom roll 90.5 DEG C 195 DEG F . The processability and resulting film quality 5 mil thickness 0.127 mm are shown below EMI28.1 In spite of the extremely high filler loadings, the ISTA formulation produced a flexible film that could be wound and handled without difficulty. In contrast, the STA and OA containing films could be made only with great difficulty and produced very fragile films with many defects. The control sample without any filler treatment resulted in such a dry mix that no film could be made. The example shows another case of specific efficacy of ISTA. BaTiO3 films with minimum binder contents are useful in the manufacture of electronic components such as ceramic capacitors. Since the products are pyrolyzed and fired in later fabrication steps, a low content of organic binder is desirable to minimize gas formation with associated risks of generating porosity in the final ceramic products. The foregoing examples illustrate, for mineral filled polyethylene, the excellent improvements in impact strength with good retention of tensile strength and stiffness flexural modulus which can be obtained by the selection of the specific impact promoters in accordance with this invention, depending upon the particular mineral filler which is present. The examples further show that by the specific use of isostearic acid in ethylene vinyl acetate compositions which are filled with barium titanate or neodymium titanate, an improvement in the ductility of the filled composition can be achieved in accordance with the present invention. Combinations of the straight impact promoters with selected hydrophobic agents, which in themselves show good mechanical response, provide impact promoter blends which lend superior water resistance to the filled polymer systems. The examples show also that these effects are quite specific to the individual, selected filler polymer systems, for which the treating agents were developed.
