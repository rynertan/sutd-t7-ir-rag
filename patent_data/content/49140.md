# A cathode for a solid state cell and a solid state cell including such a cathode.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a charge transfer complex cathode for a solid state cell, said cathode having dispersed therein particles of a chemically inert, high surface area, eletrically nonconductive material so as to effectively prevent the cell s impedance from substantially increasing during discharge thereby resulting in a greater discharge rate capability. There is also disclosed a cell including such a cathode.
