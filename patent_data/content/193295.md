# Nontacky acrylonitrile butadiene adhesive tape.

## Abstract
Adhesive tape, the adhesive layer of which comprises a copolymer of a acrylonitrile and b butadiene and or isoprene. Even though such an adhesive copolymer layer is usually substantially nontacky, it forms under moderate pressure bonds to many substrates which become stonger than the substrates. The bonds become strong more quickly when heated while the pressure is being applied. For a usefully long period of time after initiating a bond, the tape usually is repositionable.
