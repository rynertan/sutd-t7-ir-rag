# Process for preparing a polymerization catalyst and preparation of ethylene polymers with this catalyst.

## Abstract
Process for forming a catalyst containing chromium and vanadium, by depositing chromium and vanadium compounds on an inert, particulate inorganic support. The chromium is deposited as a complex of a chromium compound that may be a chromium 1,3 diketocompound with a Group II or III element hydrocarbyl. The vanadium compound can be but need not be a complex of a va nadium compound with a Group II or III element. Not more than one of the chromium and a vanadium com pounds may be the chelate of a 1,3 diketo compound, wheter or not complexed with a Group II or III element hydrocarbyl. The process for polymerizing an olefin using the catalysts of the invention is also disclosed.
