# A method of recovering non ferrous metals from their sulphide ores.

## Abstract
A method of recovering non ferrous metals from their ores comprises introducing the ore into a molten sulphide carrier that is forcibly circulated through an extraction circuit 11 , including an ore disposer 10 and an oxidiser 15 con tacting the molten carrier containing the dissolved or melted ore with oxygen in the oxidiser 15 to oxidise at least part of the ore or carrier, recovering heat thereby generated by the molten carrier, and transmitting the heat by means of the carrier to endothermic sites in the circuit.
