# A roll for use under high or low temperature conditions.

## Abstract
A roll for use under high or low temperature conditions has at least one tyre 4 with a frusto conical surface 5 which engages against a matching frusto conical surface 6 of a retaining member 3 of a different material from the tyre. In order to accommodate differential expansion between the tyre 4 and the retaining member 3 the angle 2A of the cone on which the matching frusto conical surfaces 5,6 lie is such that there is only sliding movement of the frusto conical surfaces 5,6 relative to each other.
