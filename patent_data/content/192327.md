## Description
Antiviral Compounds The present invention relates to the treatment o a human being diagnosed as being afflicted with acquired immune deticiency syndrome with a compound or formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereon. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS is an immunosuppressive or immunodestructive disease that predisposes subjects to fatal opportunistic in ections. Characteristically, AIDS is associated with a progressive depletion of T cells, especially the helper inducer subset bearing the OKT4 sur àce maker. Human T cell lymphotropic virus III HTLV III has been reproducibly isolated rom patients with AIDS or with signs and symptoms that frequently precede AIDS. HTLV III, unlike HTLV I or HTLV II, is cytopathic and appears to pre erentially insect and destroy OKT4 bearing T cells. While it is presumed that HTLV III is the aetiologic agent of AIDS, it will be understood that the taxonomy of this virus has yet to be confirmed so, for example, it is also known as lymphadenopathy virus LAV , Thus, any reference to AIDS revers to the condition and not specitically to an HTLV III inèction. US Patents Nos. 4,339,445 and 4,536,400 disclose the use of compounds of formula I in the treatment of viral inçections, including RNA tumour virus inwections. Thus, for example, certain animal retroviruses, such as visna virus, àll into this category, as do certain human retroviruses, such as HTLV I, the causative agent os certain leukaemia conditions in man, wherein T cells are caused to mutate, and proli erate rapidly. However, HTLV III is not an RNA tumour virus in that it is not tumour forming, Infection with HTLV llI results in rapid destruction os T cells and is, thus, a cytopathic virus. The present invention provides a compound of formula i EMI1.1 wherein R, R2 and R3 may be the same or different and each is selected from hydrogen, C16 alkyl, C36 cycloalkyl, C4 7 cycloalkylalkyl, benzyl and phenyl having up to three optional substituents selected rom halogen, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, C2 7 alkoxycarbonyl and C2 7 alkylcarbonyl and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof when at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is hydrogen wor use in the treatment or prophylaxis o HTLV III injections including AIDS .The invention further provides the use o a compound of formula I , and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the rnanufacture of a medicament for the treatment of HTI V III inèctions including AIDS .The present invention further includes a method òr the treatment ow a human being diagnosed as being injected with HLTV III which comprises administering to said human being an effective HLTV III incection treating amount of a compound ow formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt there. The present invention further provides a pre erred method of treating a human being having been diagnosed as having AIDS or being infected with HLTV III with a compound of formula I wherein RÚ, and Rê and R are all hydrogen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt there. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of formula I wherein at least one of R1, R2, and R3 is hydrogen comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable cation in association with an anion of a compound of formula I .Suitable cations are mono , di or trivalent and include Na , K , NH4 , NR4 wherein R is C1 6 alkyl , Ca , Mg Al , Ba , and Zn The compound of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof hereafter collectively referred to as the active ingedient may be administered by any suitable route including oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal and parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal .
