# Method of manufacturing container covers.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a cover for a can like con tainer providing improved peelability of a handle. The cover is made by forming a second resin layer by injection molding or compression forming on a multi layer sheet which oxygen, water, and the like cannot permeate. A thermally weldable first resin layer is provided on the upper surface of the multi layer sheet. The handle is formed by the second resin layer. A treatment is carried out for allowing the handle to be easily peeled off the multi layer sheet to all or part of a region of the multi layer sheet in contact with the underside of the handle.
