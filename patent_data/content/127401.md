# Electro optical element package.

## Abstract
An electro optical element package comprises a trans parent substrate 52 on which an electrode pad 51 contain ing an opening 53 is formed and the electro optical element 59 , such as a light emitting diode or photodiode, is bonded on top of the electrode pad 51 over the opening so that light is transmitted to or from the element 59 through the trans parent substrate 52 and the opening. A peripheral ceramic member 54 is bonded to the substrate 52 around the ele ment 59 and a further peripheral ceramic member 58 is bonded to the member 54 to support a cap for sealing the package. The electrode 51 and a further electrode connected to the element 59 by a bonded wire 60 extend out of the package between the ceramic members 54 and 58 .
