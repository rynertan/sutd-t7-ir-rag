# Variable displacement rotary fluid compressor and air conditioning system using the compressor.

## Abstract
A variable displacement rotary fluid compressor unit comprising first and second rotary compressor assemblies 27, 28 including respective rotor units 32, 36 rotatable about axes aligned with each other and first and second drive shafts 29, 35 respectively carrying and rotatable with the rotor units, each of the compressor assemblies having fluid inlet ports 48, 49 and outlet ports a fluid inlet chamber communicating with the fluid inlet ports 48, 49 of the two compressor assemblies 27, 28 and a fluid outlet chamber 47 communicating with the fluid outlet ports of the compressor assemblies 27, 28 a frist clutch assembly 55 comprising a drive member 57 which is rotatable about an axis aligned with the axes of rotation of the rotor units 32, 36 and which is to be driven by a drive source 82 , a driven member 66 rotatable with the first drive shaft 29 and coupling means 63, 68, 69 to couple the drive and driven members 57, 66 together when actuated and a second clutch assembly 56 comprising a driven member 75 rotatable with the second drive shaft 35 and coupling means 74, 76, 77 to couple the respective driven members of the first and second clutch assemblies together when actuated. The compressor may be incorporated as a refriger ant compressor in an air conditioning system for for example automotive use.
