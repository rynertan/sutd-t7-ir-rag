# Weld backup mechanism for internal pipe welding apparatus.

## Abstract
A weld backup mechanism includes an arcuate backup ring segment 12 , mounted on a support plate 20 and biased by a spring 30 for rotational displacement. The end faces of the arcuate backup ring segment 12 are obliquely angled and a plurality of such mechanisms are fixed to clamping members of an internal line up clamp for radial expansion and retraction therewith.
