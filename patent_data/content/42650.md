# Transmitting receiving system for teleprinter traffic via communication paths according to the ARQ system with bunched repetition.

## Abstract
Communication system for line printers, such as tele printer equipment, via high quantity radio communications. The repetition of the signals received mutilated takes place per line of signals at the end of a fixed number of lines. A transmitter receiver for the system comprises a counter 7, from which the line number is fed via an output 10 to the transmitter during the line printer return on the line feed period. The detectors 15, 17 and 18, which are connected to an input 14 of the receiver, detect whether a receiving station has received the last transmitted line unmutilated or mutilated.
