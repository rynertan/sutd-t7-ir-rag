# Anamorphic lenses.

## Abstract
Anamorphic lenses or lens arrays are formed in photo sensitively crystallizable glass by selective exposure of the glass surface and thermal treatment to cause the crystalliza tion of the glass 14 surrounding the lenses 16 . The lenses 16 , which have elongated cross sections in the plane of the exposed glass surface and raised curved surfaces resulting from the densification of the surround material, exhibit different surface curvatures over their major and minor transverse axes a a and b b and thus anamorphic light focusing properties.
