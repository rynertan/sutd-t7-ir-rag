# Textured thermo plastic film and apparatus for producing the same.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus is described for producing a perforated, textured thermoplastic film 23 having particular application as a cover stock for disposable, sanitary absor bent products such as baby diapers, sanitary napkins and the like. The apparatus includes a moving metallic belt 32 having perforations therein. The perforations are shaped according to the mathematical formula of an expanded acoustic horn. The film 23 is heated and forced into the perforations so that the inner surface of the projections have the same expanded horn shape as the perforations. The film 23 may be hydrophyllic with a hydrophobic top surface.
