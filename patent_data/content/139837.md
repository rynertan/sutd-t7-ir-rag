# Improved method for preparing alkali metal chlorates by electrolysis.

## Abstract
In the preparation of alkali metal chlorates, an aqueous alkali metal chloride is electrolyzed in the presence of at least one additive chosen from among silicates, fluorides, polybasic hydroxyalkanoic acids or their alkali metal salts, and sulfides. The use of such additives improves the power efficiency of chlorate production by eliminating the disadvan tageous effects caused by the presence of transition metals.
