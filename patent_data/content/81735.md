# Photoflash unit with circuit pattern for redundant switching of lamps.

## Abstract
A photoflash unit comprising a plurality of 2n flash lamps 21 to 30 attached to a printed circuit board and disposed in a linear array with the longitudinal axes of respective lamps aligned in parallel. Circuit patterns on the circuit board include a plurality of n selective terminal means 11 to 15 , each associated with a respective pair of the lamps and connected to one lead in wire of each of the lamps of the associated pair, and a common terminal 10 associated with all of the 2n lamps but directly connected to the other lead in wire of one lamp of each pair. Groups of circuit pattern extensions are located behind alternate lamps of the array, the first group comprising two spaced apart segments and the remaining groups each comprising three spaced apart segments. Each group of segments is covered with a mass of radiation sensitive switch material to thereby provide respective solid state switches between bridged segment gaps which are activated upon receiving radiant energy emitted by an adjacent lamp. The circuit pattern arrangement provides a pair of respective normally open switches 32 to 36 coupled between the common terminal 10 and a lead in wire of the other lamp of each pair of lamps 23 to 30 , except for the last 21, 22 , one switch positioned for activation by the prior lamp in se quence and the other switch positioned for activation by the next lamp in sequence. In this manner, the second lamp of the first n 1 pairs of lamps can be switched by either of two parallel radiation switches, thereby providing redundant switching in the event that the first lamp in any of the first n 1 pairs of lamps is defective.
