C. Sheehan, et al., J. Org. Chem., 18, No. 17, 3034 3040 1973 . The amino protecting group serves as a blocking group for the temporary protection of the amino group in the 3 position of the azetidinone ring. Such protecting groups are known for their stability under the reaction conditions used but are easily removable by conventional means afterwards. In particular, the 3 amino group is protected to prevent competitive amide formation reactions. Carboxy protecting group, as employed in the definition of the compounds represented by Formula I , refers to conventional carboxylic acid protecting ester groups commonly used in the ss lactam art for the temporary protection of the carboxylic acid function.These esters are known for their ease of preparation and removal. The carboxylic acid protecting ester groups function to block the carboxylic acid function during the process of this invention to prevent the formation of side products as well as to direct the reaction to the desired carboxylic acid function when two or more are present in the same molecule eg. the compound ofFormula II . Examples of such ester groups are methyl, ethyl, t butyl, trihaloethyl esters such as the 2,2,2trichloroethyl ester, allyl, 2 iodoethyl, methoxymethyl, esters formed with tertiary ethinyl carbinols, such as dimethylethinylcarbinol, diethylethinylcarbinol, 1ethinylcyclopentanol, or 1 ethinylcyclohexanol the arylalkyl ester forming groups such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, for example, p nitrobenzyl, pmethoxybenzyl, p methylbenzyl, diphenylmethyl, and 4 methoxydiphenylmethyl or the trialkylsilyl esters such as trimethylsilyl, and other conventional carboxyprotecting ester groups.

The compounds represented by Formula I in which a free amino or free carboxy group is present can be in salt form. For instance when R represents amino, the acid addition salts are formed with suitable acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or formic acid. Likewise, any free carboxy group can be in the salt form such as the sodium salt, the potassium salt, the ammonium salt, and salts formed with basic amines, for example, the lower alkyl primary, secondary, and tertiary amines such as diethylamine, ethylamine, methylamine, dicyclohexylamine, hexylamine, ethanol amine, or diethanolamine.Such salts may be useful in the isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention.

Also, in accordance with the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of Formula I , as defined earlier, which comprises ring closure of a compound of Formula II EMI16.1 in which R, RÚ , Rê and Y are as defined as above andX is hydroxy or halo In particular a hydroxy or ss halocarboxylic acid represented by Formula III EMI16.2 in which X is hydroxy or halo, is treated with an amine, E2N Y to produce the substituted amide represented byFormula II EMI17.1 The substituted amide then is cyclized to the p lactam, a 2 azetidinone represented by Formula I EMI17.2 In the above formulae R, R1, R2, X, and Y have the same meanings as defined earlier for Formula I . The substituted amide II is prepared by reacting the amine NR2Y with an activated derivative of the carboxylic acid such as an acid halide, acid azide, acid anhydride, or a so called active ester. Acid halides, such as the acid chloride or acid bromide, are reacted with the amine at ordinary temperatures in an inert solvent in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. triethylamine. When R in the above formula is a protected amino, acylamino, or diacylamino group, an active ester preferably is used to form the substituted amide. Active esters such as those formed with Nhydroxyimides e.g. N hydroxysuccinimide and N hydroxyphthalimide, and with N hydroxybenzotriazole HBT may be used in the process. A preferred active ester is the HBT ester.Active esters prepared with the acid and methyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate may also be used. In preparing the substituted amides ofFormula 11 in which R is a protected amino, acylamino or diacylamino group, the protected amino acid, KBT, the amine NH2Y, and a carbodiimide are reacted in an unreactive solvent such as methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or acetonitrile. The protected amino acid condense with the HBT, in the presence of the carbodiimide, to form the active ester which then reacts with the R2NY amine to form the substituted amide. Carbodiimides such as the water insoluble dicyclohexylcarbodiimide can be used, or a water soluble carbodiimide such as l cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinoethylicarbodiimide metho p toluene sulfate may be used. The primary amines, R2NY, used to prepare the substituted amides II are represented by Formulae a , b , and c EMI18.1 Examples of the amines which may be employed in the process include ethyl glycinate, methyl glycinate, ethyl cyanoglycinate, p methoxybenzyl glycinate, p nitrobenzyl glycinate, diphenylmethyl glycinate, diethyl amino malonate, dimethyl aminomalonate, ethyl 2 amino 3 oxobutyrate, ethyl a sulfoglycinate, ethyl a benzoylaminoglycinate, ethyl a aminopropionate, aminomethanesulfonic acid, ethyl 3 aminocrotonate, and dehydrovaline. Examples of p substituted acids which may be used in the process are the amino acids, serine, threonine, F hydroxyglutamic acid, p hydroxylysine, ss hydroxyaspartic acid, in which the amino group is suitably protected, and the ss substituted acids malic acid, chloro and bromo succinic acid, chloropivalic acid, bromopivalic acid, a methoxy ss hydroxybutyric acid, tartaric acid, a,B dihydroxyhexanoic acid, or a 2 hydroxyethyl B hydroxybutyric acid. The cyclization to the azetidinone of the substituted amide of Formula II in which X is hydroxy and Y is a sulfomethyl, esterified carboxymethyl, or substituted vinyl group and which is formed from amines a, b, or c, is carried out in an inert anhydrous solvent with an organo phosphorous compound selected from triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphite, diphenyl phenylphosphonate, and phenyl diphenyiphosphinoate, and a dialkylazodicarboxylate. The cyclization occurs readily under mild conditions, for example1 at a temperature between about 150C. and about 400C. and conveniently at or about ambient room temperature. The organo phosphorous compound and the dialkylazodicarboxylate are each used in about 100 mole percent to about 150 mole percent relative to the substituted amide II.Solvents which may be used are desirably the lower boiling aprotic organic solvents in which the starting material and the reactants are soluble. Tetrahydrofuran THF is a preferred solvent while other common solvents such as acetonitrile, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, and dimethylacetamide may be used as well as mixtures of such organic solvents. TEF is a preferred solvent because it is easy to remove from the reaction mixture. Preferred dialkylazodicarboxylates are diethylazodicarboxylate and diisopropylazodicarboxylate. A preferred organo phosphorus compound is triphenylphosphine. The cyclization is carried out by adding the dialkylazodicarboxylate to a solution of the substituted amide II and the organo phosphorus with agitation. The cyclization usually is complete in about one hour or less when the process is conducted on a small scale with the preferred triphenylphosphine.For large scale manufacturing the reaction should be completed in somewhat longer times. In an example of the process N benzyloxycarbonyl L serine is coupled with diethylaminomalonate to form the dipeptide substituted amide II in which R is protected amino, X OH, R1 R2 B, and Y is CB COOC2H5 . The dipeptide is reacted with triphenylphosphinediethylazodicarboxylate to form, as shown in the following reaction scheme, the azetidinone N diethoxy carbonylmethyl 3 benzyloxycarbonylamino 2 a7etidinohe and a minor amount of the aziridine side product. EMI21.1 In carrying out the process, any free carboxy groups, other than that required to form the desired amide with E2NY, are protected during the process with a conventional carboxy protecting ester group. Likewise any free amino groups, such as when R is amino, are protected with an amino protecting group during the process. When the process is carried out with a phalo substituted amide Formula II, X halo , the cyclization to the ss lactam is effected with a strong base such as a lithium dialkylamide eg. lithium ditert butylamide, or lithium diisopropylamide and like lithium amides or lithium hexamethyldisilazide. The cyclization is carried out under anhydrous conditions in an inert aprotic organic solvent such as TES, dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. Mixtures of such solvents also may be used to form the reaction medium. A preferred base is a lithium dialkylamide and, in particular, lithium diisopropylamide. With the preferred base the reaction is carried out initially at a temperature between about 800C. and about 250C. at which temperature the anionic form of the substituted amide is generated. The reaction then is allowed to warm to a temperature of between about 100C. and about 250C. during which time p lactam ring formation occurs. Approximately 200 mole percent of a preferred base relative to the substituted amide is used for best yields of the p lactam compound.When used at 100 mole percent the desired P lactam product is obtained in only minor amounts, and, in the instance in which Y is a sulfo substituted methyl group or an esterified carboxysubstituted methyl group formed with amines a and b , the substituted 2 pyrrolidone is the major product. According to the process of this invention a selective cyclization to the 4 membered p lactam ring is observed. N alkylation of the amide nitrogen of the F substituted amide Formula II occurs rather thanC alkylation of the a carbon bearing the electron withdrawing group s . C Alkylation of the active methylene group would be expected since the acidity of the amide NSH bond and the a CE bond should differ only slightly.For example, cyclization via C alkylation of Cbz protected serylaminomalonate represented by the formula EMI22.1 would be expected to yield the 5 membered pyrrolidone represented by the following formula EMI23.1 It has been found, however, that the greater the acidity of the a CH proton the more selective the amide N H alkylation becomes and the more the 4 membered ss lactam product predominates. The preferred process of this invention for the preparation df the ss lactam compounds of Formula I shown belowEMI23.2 is the cyclization of a hydroxy substituted amide II X OB with triphenylphosphine and a dialkylazodicarboxylate. A further preferred embodiment of the process for the preparation of a compound of the Formula I in which Y is a group of the formulaEMI23.3 comprises the cyclization of a halo substituted amide II . A further preferred process of this invention comprises the use of a Hydroxy substituted amide represented by the FormulaEMI24.1 in which R is protected amino, acylamino, or diacylamino, and the cyclization thereof to a 3 protectedamino , acylamino , or diacylamino 2 azetidinone. In particular, R is a protected amino group in the process and Y is a group represented by the formulae.EMI24.2 Preferred protected amino groups in this embodiment of the invention are the carbamate protecting groups as defined earlier and in particular the benzyloxycarbonyl amino and p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino protected amino groups. A particularly preferred protected amino group is the 4,5 diphenyl 4 oxazolin 2 one group oxy protecting group represented by the following formula EMI24.3 In a further preferred embodiment, R is a preferred amino protected amino group and R3 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl, or protected carboxy, and R4 is C1 C4 alkyl or a carboxy protecting group.In an example of the preferred embodiment N Cbz L serine is converted to the active HBT ester with HBT and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the ester allowed to react with diethyl aminomalonate to form the N Cbz L serine aminomalonate dipeptide represented by the formula,EMI25.1 The dipeptide is reacted with 100 mole percent of TPP and about 100 mole percent of diethylazodicarboxylate to provide the ss lactam product, N diethoxycarbonyl methyl 3 benzyloxycarbonylamino 2 azetidinone and the aziridine side product as shown in the following reEMI25.2 in which Cbz benzyloxycarbonyl DEAD diethylazodicarboxylate, and TPP triphenylphosphine. The mixture is separated by chromatography to provide the purified ss lactam compound. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, L serine is reacted with 1,2 diphenylvinylene carbonate to provide the Ox protected L serine and the latter is converted to the HBT ester and coupled with diethyl aminomalonate to form the dipeptide Formula II , R protected amino, X OH, R1 R2 H, and Y diethoxycarbonylmethyl .The Ox protected dipeptide is reacted with TPP and diisopropylazodicarboxylate DIAD to provide the 3 Ox protected amino 8 lactam as shown in the following reaction scheme EMI26.1 In a further preferred embodiment of the invention L threonine is converted to the Ox protected derivative, coupled with diethyl aminomalonate and, the dipeptide obtained is converted with TPP and diisopropylazodicarboxylate to the Ox protected 3 amino2 azetidinone as shown in the following reaction scheme EMI27.1 The amino protecting group of the 3 protected amino 2 azetidinones is removed to provide the 3amino 2 azetidinones. For example in the above preferred embodiments the Cbz protecting group is removed by hydrogenolysis using palladium on carbon catalyst.The Ox protecting group is removed likewise as shown below.EMI27.2 The 3 amino 2 azetidinones Formula I , R NH2 , can be acylated with an active derivative of the desired carboxylic acid to provide a compound ofFormula I in which R is an acylamino group. Alternatively, the 3 acylamino 2 azetidinones Formula I can be obtained in the process of the invention as described earlier. However, in the process, an acylamino substituted amide Formula II , R acylamino undergoes cyclization to form the oxazoline side product as well as the p lactam formation. Accordingly, the 3 acylamino 2 azetidinones preferably are prepared via acylation of a 3 amino 2 azetidinone obtained with a 3 protected amino azetidinone as described above. Preferred 3 acylaminoazetidinones of the invention are represented by Formula I in which R is amino, protected amino or an acylamino group Further preferred 3 acylamino 2 azetidinones are represented by the formula,EMI28.1 in which Y is CE2COOH or CH2 S03H, Examples of such preferred compounds are N carboxymethyl 3 phenylglycylamino 2 azetidinone, N sulfomethyl 3 mandeloylamino 2 azetidinone, N carboxymethyl 3 t2 thienylacetylamino 2 azetidinone,N carboxymethyl 3 mandeloylamino 2 asetidinone, N sulfomethyl 3 mandeloylamino 2 azetidinone, N carboxy methyl 3 a carboxyphenylacetylamino 2 azetidinone, N carboxymethyl 3 a carboxy 4 hydroxyphenyleacetyl amino 2 azetidinone, N sulfomethyl 3 a sulfophenylacetylamino 2 azetidinone and N carboxymethyl 3 alpha sulfophenylacetylamino 2 azetidinone. A further preferred group of compounds of the invention are represented by the following formula EMI29.1 in which Y is a carboxymethyl or sulfomethyl group in which R3 and R4, independently, are hydrogen or methyl, and R and R have the same meanings as defined forFormula I . Preferably R is 2 furyl, 2 thienyl, or 2 aminothiazol 4 yi, and R is methyl, carboxymethyl, or 2 carboxyprop 2 yl. Examples of the preferred compounds are N sulfomethyl 3 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyiminoacetamido 4 methyl 2 azetidinone, N sulfomethyl 3 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 2 carboxyprop 2yl oxyiminoacetamido 4 methyl 2 azetidinone, N carboxymethyl 3 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyiminoacet amido 2 azetidinone, N carboxymethyl 3 2 2 furyl 2 methoxyiminoacetamido 4 methyl 2 azetidinone, N carboxymethyl 3 2 2 thienyl 2 2 carboxyprop 2 yl oxyiminoacetamido 2 azetidinone, or a sodium or potassium salt thereof. The F lactam compounds represented by theFormula I are intermediates useful in the preparation of antibiotics and p lactamase inhibitors. A number of preparative routes have been devised for the penem, penam, oxapenem, oxacephalosporins, clavulanic acid, monobactam, and thienomycin structures, virtually all of which employ a substituted 2 azetidinone. The compounds Formula I of this invention can be used in such preparative routes or can be converted by methods known in the art to structures which in turn can be used as intermediates.For example, in mentioning only a few of such routes, compounds of Formula I in whichR1 is hydrogen, h is carboxy, and Y is a carboxy protected carboxymethyl group can be converted to the 2 substituted penams via the corresponding 4 methylthio2 azetidinones as described by Foxton, M.W. et al., Recent Advances in the Chemistry of ss lactam Antibiotics , G.I. Gregory ed , 1981 p. 281 and Tetrahedron Letters, 1981, 22, 2479. Likewise, the 2 substituted penems described by Woodward, R.B. et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1978, 100, 8214, can be prepared via the 4 acylthio 2azetidinones obtained by known methods with compounds of the invention. Compounds of the invention in which R is hydroxy substituted alkyl eg. ethyl and Y is a carboxy substituted vinyl group can be used in the preparation of thienamycin described by Karady, S. et al., J. Amer.Chem. Soc., 1981, 103, 6765, or the method described bySchmitt, S.M. et al., J. Org. Chem. 1980, 100, 313. The compounds in which Y is a substituted vinyl group can be converted by known oxidative cleavage methods, eg. with ozone, to the N unsubstituted azeti dinone and the latter N alkylated to nocardian type antibiotics or to the antibiotic substance PS 5 by using the procedures described by Kametani, T. et al.,Heterocyclics, 1982, 19, 1023, and Kametani, T., lieterocyclics 1982, 17, 463, 479 for carbapenem synthesis I via N substituted methylazetidin 2 ones. Clavulanic acids and analogs thereof may be obtained with compounds of the invention by the methods described by Bently, P.H. et al., in Recent Advances in the Chemistry of ss Lactam Antibiotics , 1981, p. 175, Tetrahedron Letters 1979, 1889 and, alsoParker, R.M. et al., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commum., 1977, 905, 906. 1 Oxapenams oxabisnorpenicillins may be made with compounds of the invention by conversion by known methods to the starting materials employed byCama, L.D. et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 44, 4233 in preparing the l oxapenams. Certain of the compounds of the invention are useful intermediates for preparing the 3 acylamino2 azetidinones described above. For example, when R inFormula I is the 3 protected amino or the 3 amino group, the compounds represented are useful in the preparation of the 3 acylamino substituted azetidinone antibacterials. For example, the protecting group of the amino protected ss lactam is removed to provide the 3 amino p lactam. The latter nucleus compound is then acylated by employing acylation methods commonly used to acylate other p lactam nucleus compounds such as 6 APA and 7 ACA. Such methods include the use of an active derivative of the carboxylic acid acylating moiety such as the acid halides, and active esters. Active esters such as those prepared with the acid and methyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate, or with the N hydroxy heterocyclics such as N hydroxybenzotriazole, and N hydroxysuccinimide can be used.During the acylation of a 3 amino 2 azetidinone compound any fre carboxy or other amino groups in the molecule are protected by conventional means. For example, N diphenylmethoxycarbonylmethyl 3 amino 2 azetidinone is reacted in THF water with phenoxyacetyl chloride in the presence of triethyl amine to provide N diphenylmethoxycarbonylmethyl 3 phenoxyacetamido 2 azetidinone. Treatment of the product with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole removes the diphenylmethyl ester group to provide the N carboxymethyl azetidinone. Acylation of N dimethoxycarbonyl methyl J 3 amino 4 benzyloxycarbonyl 2 azetidinone with N t Boc protected D phenylglycine in the form of the active ester formed with isobutyl chloroformate provides, after deblocking the a amino group and the C4 carboxy group,N dimethoxycarbonyl methyl 3 D phenylglycylamino 4carboxy 2 azetidinone. Saponification forms the N carboxymethyl compound. The compounds of the invention in which Y is a dialkoxycarbonylmethyl group are converted to compounds in which Y is carboxymethyl by saponification under mild conditions. Upon de esterification to the N dicarboxymethyl compound, decarboxylation results forming theN carboxymethyl substituted 2 azetidinone The compounds of Formula I in which R2 is sulfhydryl, C1 C4 alkylthio, C C4 alkanoylthio or halo, are prepared after cyclization with compounds of the Formula I in which R2 is a group convertible, by known methods, to halo, for example the carboxy group.The halo substituted compound then can be converted to the SH, S alkyl, or S alkanoyl group To further illustrate the invention, the following non limiting examples are provided. In the examples, melting points were taken on a Thomas Hoover melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 727b spectrometer. NMR spectra were obtained in chloroform d with tetramethylsilane as a reference, unless otherwise stated, on a Varian EM390, XL 100 or Nicolet NB300Spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on an AEIScientific Apparatus 902 or Dupont DP102 spectrometer.High pressure LC was performed using a Beckman AltexModel 332 chromatograph.

The amino protected amino acid, 2 eq. ofN hydroxybenzotriazole HBT , ca. 1.2 eq. of the amine hydrochloride and 1 eq. of triethylamine are dissolved in methylene chloride or DMF. DicyclohexylcarbodiimideDCC ca. 1.2 eq is added and the reaction mixture stirred for about 4 hours to about 20 hours. The resulting insoluble dicyclohexylurea is separated by filtration and the filtrate diluted with diethylether or with ethyl acetate. The solution is washed with 10 sodium carbonate, 0.lN hydrochloric acid, water only when DMF was the solvent , brine, and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The purified product is isolated after evaporation, chromatography where necessary and or recrystallization. Method B. Alternatively, the water and methylene chloride soluble carbodiimide, l cyclohexyl 3 2morpholinoethyl carbodiimide metho p toluene sulfonate Aldrich is used instead of DCC. Since the urea produced is water soluble, no chromatographic purification is necessary.
