# Improvements in or relating to sights.

## Abstract
Gun sight into which an aiming mark in the form of a cross is introduced. A rotatable reflector 2 scanning an LED array 1 directs an image of the array first towards one light trans mission system 7 and then towards another 4, 6 during the course of rotation. The image travelling through one system 4, 6 is rotated relative to the image travelling through the other system 7 and the two images are combined 8 . Control means are provided selectively to energise individual ones of the LED s so that the effect of combining the two images is a cross the centre of which can be chosen by controlling which of the LED s is energized different times.
