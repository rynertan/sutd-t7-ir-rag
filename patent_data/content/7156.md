Elution with ethyl acetate afforded the title compound as a colorless viscous oil.Trituration with ether gave a white solid which was suspended in a mixture of ether hexane 1 1, v v , collected, and dried to give 1.6 g of dimethylN,N 2,2 propanediyl bis 4,1 phenyleneoxycarbonyl N methylimino thio N methylimino carbonyloxy bis ethanimidothioate , m.p. 146 150 C.Caled. for C29H38N6O8S4 C, 47.92 H,5.27 N,11.56 S, 17.65 Found C,47.6 H,5.32 N,11.9 S, 17.0 S, 17.4 By employing the appropriate procedures as described in Examples 1 10, the compounds shown inTables I VIII can be prepared.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few pints to several hundred gallons per acre. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulations. The formulations, broadly, contain about 1 to 99 by weight of active ingredientCs and at least one of a about 0,1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99 solid or liquid diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 5 50 40 95 0 15 Emulsions, Solu tions including Emulsifiable Concentrates Aqueous Suspensions 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 1 95 5 99 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2 Compositions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound.For Example, many of the compounds are relatively low melting solids or glasses. In these cases, the strength of wettable powders and granules must he limited because of physical handling considerations. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described inWatkins, et al., Handbook of insecticide DustDiluents and Carriers , 2nd. Edn., Dorland Books,Caldwell, N.J. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd. Edn.,Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0,1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation.at OOC. McCutcheonts Detergents andEmulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Col, Ridgewood, NewJersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia ofSurface Active Agents , Chemical Publ. Co., Inc.,New York, 1964, list surfactant and recommended uses.All formualtions can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbioloqical qrowth, etc. Preferably, ingredients should be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Aqency for the use intended. The methods.of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.

USE The compounds of this invention are useful for control of insects and nematodes which are detrimental to agriculture. As demonstrated in the following examples the compounds have provided a hish degree of control of important agricultural pests with minimization of side effects known in prior art compounds such as phytotoxicity. Only a slight effect has been noted on cotton with compounds within Formula I, i.e. dimethyl N,N LEl,2 ethanediylbis oxyzarbonyl N methylimino thio N methyl imino carbonyloxy bis ethanimidothioate , dimethylN,N 1,3 propanediylbis oxycarbonyl N methylimino thio N methylimino carbonyloxy bis ethanimidothio ate and methyl 2 dimethylamino N CCCCCCN methyl N methyl 3 N methyl N methyl N 1 methylthioethylidene aminooxycarbonyl aminothio aminocarbonyloxy propoxycarbonyl aminothio aminocarbonyloxy 2 oxo ethanimidothioate . The compounds readily control pestiferous insects belonging to such orders as Lepidoptera,Coleoptera, and Diptera. More specifically, insects controlled by the compounds of this invention include but are not limited to southern armyworm Spodoptera eridania , fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda , soybean looper Pseudoplus ia includens , Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis , the house fly Musca domestica , budworm Heliothis virescens and bollworm Heliothis zea . These compounds readily control pestiferous nematodes. More specifically nematodes controlled by compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, the root knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita lesion nematode, Pratylenchus spp. and dagger nematode,Xiphinima. The insects are controlled by applying one or more of the compounds to the locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or to the pests themselves.For the control of insects on agricultural crops, compounds of this invention are generally applied to the foliage or other plant parts which are infested or which are to be protected. Effective amounts to be applied depend upon the specific compound used, the species to be controlled, its life stage, its size and location, the amount of rainfall, the time of year, moisture, temperature, type aof application plant spacing, and other variables. In general, .05 to 10 Kg ha may be required for insect control in agriculture with rates of .15 to 5 Kg ha usually being sufficient in many situations. In large scale field operations, rates in the range of .25 to 3 Kg ha are generally used. Nematodes are controlled by applying the compounds to the locus of infestation to the area to be protected or to the pest themselves. For the control of nematodes in agricultural crops, a compound of this invention is generally applied to a portion of the plant or surrounding soil which is infested or which is to be protected. Effective amounts to be applied depend upon the species to be controlled, its life stage, its size and location, the amount of rainfall, the time of year, moisture, temperature, soil type, percentage of area treated, type of application, and other variables. In general, 3 to 30 Kg ha may be.required for nematode control in agriculture with rates of 5 to 10 Kg ha usually being sufficient in many situations. The compounds of this invention possess significant advantages over prior art compounds. For example1 their improved residual insecticidal activity can reduce the need for closely spaced multiply sprays re resulting in greater economy to the grower and dissemination of less insecticide in the environment.An additional advantage is the reduced side effects on cotton. Treated leaves remain green and free of reddening. The compounds of this invention can be mixed with fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, insecticides, or other biologically active compounds in order to achieve desired results with a minimum expendi ture of time, effort and material. Amounts of these biologically active materials added for each part by weight of the composition of this invention may vary from 0.05 to 25 parts by weight. Suitable agents of this type are well known to those skilled in the art.
