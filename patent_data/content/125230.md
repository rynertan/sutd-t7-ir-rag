# Dehydrogenation process.

## Abstract
Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkyl or dialkyl aromatic hydrocarbons such as ethylbenzene or ethyltoluene to vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons is achieved by passing the aromatic hydrocarbons on a crystalline silica which has been calcined under an inert atmosphere and which contains from about 0.05 to about 1 weight percent of an alkali metal oxide such as sodium oxide. In the preparation of the crystalline silica, limited washing of the crystalline silica precursor is performed to obtain an amount of alkali metal oxide remain ing in the crystalline silica between about 0.05 and about 1 weight .
