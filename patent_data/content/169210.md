## Description
This invention relates to a high speed ECL gate circuit and, more particularly, relates to a dynamic ECL gate circuit for driving line loads having significant capacitance. A form of current steering logic, known as emitter coupled logic ECL is widely utilized. ECL results in high performance products and has the shortest propagation delay of any logic form. With ECL logic, superior comparator functions and high speed analog to digital conversion may be accomplished. ECL logic is utilized in such diverse applications as instrumentation, computers, phased array radar, telecommunication systems, and a host of modern electronics applications where high performance is required or desired. Basic circuit design and processing for ECL is well known. See, e.g., One attempt to overcome the capacitive loading problem for ECL gates has been to utilize active pulldown transistors which bring down the line voltage at appropriate times in the logic cycle. This approach requires the generation of a separate pulldown reference voltage and does not produce energy efficient operation. See J.E. Price, Emitter Coupled Logic Circuit With Active Pull Down , U.S. Patent No. 4,347,446. Such push pull arrangements are difficult to design and require extra power supplies. Another approach has been to couple the bases of output transistors through a resistor to complementary logic levels to increase high to low transition times. See, eg, A W Chang et al, Complementary Driver for Emitter Coupled Logic Gates , Reference may also be made to US Patent Specifications 3978347, 3727188 and 4276485. It is also known from US 3727188 that a transient increase of potential may be provided on the base of a transistor in an ECL circuit to shorten the switching time of that transistor. We will therefore describe an ECL gate circuit which is capable of driving significant capacitive loads. We will describe an ECL gate circuit which utilizes on chip capacitances to speed up the pulldown of the output transitions. We will describe a complementary logic level within an ECL gate to speed up transitions by generating a voltage transient or appropriate sign on the base of the current source transistor connected to the logic output. In one aspect the present invention provides an ECL gate circuit having one or more input transistors, a reference voltage transistor an output line the output line having associated therewith an emitter follower for pulling up the output line and a current sources transistor for pulling down the output line In a further aspect the present invention provides an ECL gate circuit having multiple input transistors, a reference voltage transistor, the complement to output lines each output line having associated therewith a respective emitter follower for pulling up the output line and a current source transistor for forming the emitter resistor of the emitter follower pulling down the output line, For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference may be had to the accompanying drawings which are incorporated herein by reference and in which An ECL circuit is provided which is adapted to drive loads having significant capacitance. A single level or multiple level ECL gate such as an OR NOR gate is provided with ancillary capacitors between the bases of the current source transistors and circuit points within the gate circuit having complementary logic levels. As logic levels shift, the occurrence of a transition in the complementary level will produce a transient current through the ancillary capacitor thereby momentarily altering the voltage on the base of the associated current source transistor. When the logic level on the collector of a current source transistor is experiencing a high to low transition the base voltage will be momentarily increased due to this transient thereby increasing the current sunk through the current source transistor and speeding up the high to low transition time. Similarly, when the level on the collector of a current source transistor is experiencing a low to high transition the base voltage will be momentarily decreased due to this transient thereby decreasing the current through the current source transistor and speeding up the low to high transition produced by the associated emitter follower. The standard building block for ECL logic circuitry is the OR NOR circuit shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, an application of a high logic signal to the terminals A, B, or C which are the bases, respectively, of bipolar transistors 2, 3 and 4, will result in a high OR output on the emitter of noninverting output transistor 9 and a low NOR output on the emitter of inverting output transistor 8. The logical operation of the OR NOR gate circuit is symbolized by the logic diagram shown in Fig. 1a. The operation of this conventional ECL gate is described in detail, for example in L. S. Garrett, ECL and MOS Devices , in In practice, it is the downgoing portion of the cycle which is most severely degraded. This may be understood conceptually by examining the operation of the OR NOR gate circuit of Figs. 2 and 4. Transistor 15 is an emitter follower as is its complementary counterpart transistor 14 that provides current to OR output line 31 to produce a low to high transition whenever a high input is provided on terminals A, B or C to transistors 21, 22 or 23. Emitter follower 15 is a low impedance device. Thus, as long as a signal voltage is applied to its base a substantial current supply is available to OR output line 31, i.e. a supply which appears unlimited insofar as the modest capacitance C The dynamic ECL circuit of the present invention utilizes on chip capacitances to provide a transient boost to the current carrying capabilities of the load current source transistors 10 and 11 in ECL gate circuits. The transient boost is generated by connecting a capacitor between the base of the current source transistor and a point in the circuit which carries a complementary logic level. As shown in Figs. 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d, when the logic level on OR output line 31 is experiencing a low to high transition the complementary logic level on NOR output line 30 is experiencing a downgoing transition. Since the complementary logic level is connected through a capacitor to the base of load current source transistor 11, the voltage on the base of current source transistor 11 will drop momentarily by ΔV The preceding paragraph stresses the dynamic nature of the ECL circuit of the present invention. A change in voltage V One embodiment of the dynamic ECL circuit of the present invention is shown in Fig. 2. It is shown as a conventional OR NOR ECL gate circuit modified in accordance with the present invention. Figs. 2 4 share common elements and where common devices and functions are indicated, identical numbers are used. The function of the ECL gate circuit, as described above, is to accept logic level inputs on the base terminals A, B and C of transistors 21, 22 and 23 and to provide a logical OR output on line 31 along with a logical NOR output on line 30. The embodiments of Figs. 2 4 utilize single level logic, i.e. a single voltage level in the input and output. On the other hand, as described subsequently, multiple level logic is possible and a dual level logic scheme is shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 2, transistor 11, appropriately called a current source transistor, serves to pull down the OR output line 31, while transistor 15, called an emitter follower, serves to pull up the OR output line 31. Similarly, current source transistor 10 serves to pull down NOR output line 30, while emitter follower 14 serves to pull up NOR output line 31. In this description the terms pullup, rising, upgoing and low to high are synonyms and the terms pulldown, downgoing, falling and high to low are synonyms. Due to the length of the output lines 31 and 30 and the electrical properties of the associated topological features in an integrated circuit there is a capacitive load 18 of capacitance C As seen in the timing diagrams of Figs. 7a and 7b, an OR output logic level is produced on line 31 even dotted line and a NOR logic level on line 30 Fig. 7b following the impression of a logical input heavy solid line on base terminals A, B or C of transistors 21, 22 or 23. The upgoing signal on line 31 and the complementary downgoing signal on line 30 follow the input by a short time delay. In a circuit arranged in accordance with the present invention the OR output logic level is advanced as shown by the light solid line. Rise times in conventional ECL gate circuits are typically on the order of 1 2 ns whereas fall times are typically 2 4 ns. As described previously, these rise and fall times are materially reduced by the use of capacitors between the bases of current output transistors and the complementary logic levels. The rise time is reduced from t In the first embodiment of Fig. 2, the capacitor C₂ is connected between the base of current source transistor 10 and the OR output line 31. And, the capacitor C₁ is connected between the base of current source transistor 11 and the NOR output line 30 to take advantage of the complementary logic level available. Either capacitor may be used alone or the two capacitors may be used together as shown, depending on whether there is a circuit requirement for an improved fall time on either or both the OR output or the NOR output. The bandgap reference voltage V Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 4. Here, the base of current source transistor 10 is connected through capacitor C₂ to the base of emitter follower 15 and the base of current source transistor 11 is connected through capacitor C₁ to the base of emitter follower 14. The nature of operation of emitter follower 14 will be that it will be conductive when NOR output transistor 10 is conductive. Thus, at such time as there is a high to low transition taking place on OR output line 31, there will have been a low to high transition taking place on NOR output line 30. Emitter follower 14 will have become conductive to supply current to support the low to high transition on NOR output line 30. Thus, the base of emitter follower transistor 14 will go to a high level thereby producing a momentary increase in the voltage on the base of transistor 11, ΔV In the embodiment of Fig. 3, the base of current source transistor 10 is shown as being connected through capacitor C₁ to the collector of current source transistor 16 and to the common emitters of transistors 21, 22 and 23. This connection is possible since when a high to low transition is to take place on NOR output line 30, there will be current flowing through at least one of the transistors 21, 22 and 23 and thence through transistor 16 to low voltage level V The capacitors C₁ and C₁ shown in Figs. 2 5 are of small value on the order of 0.05 0.1 pf. They are obtained, for example, by integrating extra bases to the load current source transistor collectors, i.e. to the collector of current source transistor 10 or to the collector of current source transistor 11, shown in Fig. 2, or to the collector of input current source transistor 16, shown in Fig. 3. Such capacitors would be parasitic capacitors. These small capacitances can also be obtained by integrating extra emitters onto current source transistors 10 and 11 and connecting these emitters to the complementary circuit points, i.e. to the collector of current source transistor 10, to the collector of current source transistor 11, etc. Multiple level logic is now common for ECL gate circuits. The dynamic ECL gate circuit approach of the present invention is applicable to such schemes since they all contain complementary logic levels and have current source transistors which are current limited. By dynamic charge pumping means using a capacitor, as described above, a transient increase or decrease in the current through a given current source transistor is obtained to speed up the transition times on the output line associated with the transistor. As shown in Fig. 5 in a dual level logic scheme there will be two voltage levels or more precisely voltage ranges on OR output line 31 which will signify two discrete logic states. The first level will be uniquely accessible only on line 33 the second will be accessible on line 31. Similarly, there will be two voltage ranges on NOR output line 30 which will signify different logic states with the first logic level only being accessible on line 34 the second will be accessible on line 30. In order to provide inputs for the two logic levels, additional input transistors 38, 39 and 40 are provided so that additional logic inputs A , B and C may be provided. An additional reference voltage V The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and many modifications and variations are possible so long as the base of a current source transistor is connected through a capacitor to a circuit point having a complementary logic level. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention in yet additional embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
