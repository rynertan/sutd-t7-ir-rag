# X ray film cassette loader.

## Abstract
Apparatus for loading a single sheet of X ray film into a cassette, from a plastic lighttight envelope containing a stack of such sheets, all in a daylight environment. A receiver for holding the envelope containing the sheets includes a clip at the top that holds one end of the envelope and a groove at the bottom into which the lower end of the envelope can be laid. A rod lies in the groove over the envelope, so that when the lower envelope end is cut, no light leaks in. However, when the receiver is placed on a dispenser, the rod can be withdrawn from outside the receiver to open the envelope and allow the stack of film to fall out into the dispenser which can feed one sheet at a time into the cassette. The cassette lies in a pivotally mounted cassette holding housing that has a light seal at the top so that, when the housing pivots under the dispenser, the apparatus is sealed against light and, when the housing pivots away from the dispenser, the cassette can pop up and be withdrawn through the top of the housing.
