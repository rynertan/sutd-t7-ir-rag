# Thermometric compositions for measuring and indicating low temperatures and related thermometric devices.

## Abstract
For the measurement and the indication of low tempera tures, particularly between 0 C and 30 C, there is foreseen a thermometric composition of cholesteric substances com prising, besides cholesteryl nonanoate, cholesteryl oleyl car bonate and cholesteryl chloride, cholesteryl acetate in an amount increasing with the increase from 0 C to 30 C of the temperature to be measured and indicated. There are also contemplated thermometric indicating devices, particularly suitable for the measuring and indicating of the temperature of freezing cells.
